For {product-title} clusters that are installed on restricted networks, also known as _disconnected clusters_, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) by default cannot access the Red{nbsp}Hat-provided OperatorHub sources hosted on remote registries because those remote sources require full internet connectivity.

However, as a cluster administrator you can still enable your cluster to use OLM in a restricted network if you have a workstation that has full internet access. The workstation, which requires full internet access to pull the remote OperatorHub content, is used to prepare local mirrors of the remote sources, and push the content to a mirror registry.

The mirror registry can be located on a bastion host, which requires connectivity to both your workstation and the disconnected cluster, or a completely disconnected, or _airgapped_, host, which requires removable media to physically move the mirrored content to the disconnected environment.

This guide describes the following process that is required to enable OLM in restricted networks:

* Disable the default remote OperatorHub sources for OLM.
* Use a workstation with full internet access to create and push local mirrors of the OperatorHub content to a mirror registry.
* Configure OLM to install and manage Operators from local sources on the mirror registry instead of the default remote sources.

After enabling OLM in a restricted network, you can continue to use your unrestricted workstation to keep your local OperatorHub sources updated as newer versions of Operators are released.

[IMPORTANT]
====
While OLM can manage Operators from local sources, the ability for a given Operator to run successfully in a restricted network still depends on the Operator itself meeting the following criteria:

* List any related images, or other container images that the Operator might require to perform their functions, in the `relatedImages` parameter of its `ClusterServiceVersion` (CSV) object.
* Reference all specified images by a digest (SHA) and not by a tag.

You can search software on the link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/search?p=1&deployed_as=Operator&type=Containerized%20application&badges_and_features=Disconnected[Red{nbsp}Hat Ecosystem Catalog] for a list of Red{nbsp}Hat Operators that support running in disconnected mode by filtering with the following selections:

== Prerequisites

* Log in to your {product-title} cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using OLM in a restricted network on {ibm-z-name}, you must have at least 12 GB allocated to the directory where you place your registry.

== Mirroring an Operator catalog

For instructions about mirroring Operator catalogs for use with disconnected clusters, see xref:../../disconnected/mirroring/installing-mirroring-installation-images.adoc#olm-mirroring-catalog_installing-mirroring-installation-images[Installing -> Mirroring images for a disconnected installation].

[IMPORTANT]
====
As of {product-title} 4.11, the default Red{nbsp}Hat-provided Operator catalog releases in the file-based catalog format. The default Red{nbsp}Hat-provided Operator catalogs for {product-title} 4.6 through 4.10 released in the deprecated SQLite database format.

The `opm` subcommands, flags, and functionality related to the SQLite database format are also deprecated and will be removed in a future release. The features are still supported and must be used for catalogs that use the deprecated SQLite database format.

Many of the `opm` subcommands and flags for working with the SQLite database format, such as `opm index prune`, do not work with the file-based catalog format. For more information about working with file-based catalogs, see xref:../../operators/understanding/olm-packaging-format.adoc#olm-file-based-catalogs_olm-packaging-format[Operator Framework packaging format], xref:../../operators/admin/olm-managing-custom-catalogs.adoc#olm-managing-custom-catalogs-fb[Managing custom catalogs], and xref:../../disconnected/mirroring/installing-mirroring-disconnected.adoc#installing-mirroring-disconnected[Mirroring images for a disconnected installation using the oc-mirror plugin].
