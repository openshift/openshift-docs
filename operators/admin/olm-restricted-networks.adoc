For {product-title} clusters that are installed on restricted networks, also known as _disconnected clusters_, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) by default cannot access the Red Hat-provided OperatorHub sources hosted on remote registries because those remote sources require full Internet connectivity.

However, as a cluster administrator you can still enable your cluster to use OLM in a restricted network if you have a workstation that has full Internet access. The workstation, which requires full Internet access to pull the remote OperatorHub content, is used to prepare local mirrors of the remote sources, and push the content to a mirror registry.

The mirror registry can be located on a bastion host, which requires connectivity to both your workstation and the disconnected cluster, or a completely disconnected, or _airgapped_, host, which requires removable media to physically move the mirrored content to the disconnected environment.

This guide describes the following process that is required to enable OLM in restricted networks:

* Disable the default remote OperatorHub sources for OLM.
* Use a workstation with full Internet access to create and push local mirrors of the OperatorHub content to a mirror registry.
* Configure OLM to install and manage Operators from local sources on the mirror registry instead of the default remote sources.

After enabling OLM in a restricted network, you can continue to use your unrestricted workstation to keep your local OperatorHub sources updated as newer versions of Operators are released.

[IMPORTANT]
====
While OLM can manage Operators from local sources, the ability for a given Operator to run successfully in a restricted network still depends on the Operator itself. The Operator must:

* List any related images, or other container images that the Operator might require to perform their functions, in the `relatedImages` parameter of its `ClusterServiceVersion` (CSV) object.
* Reference all specified images by a digest (SHA) and not by a tag.

See the following Red Hat Knowledgebase Article for a list of Red Hat Operators that support running in disconnected mode:

== Prerequisites

* Log in to your {product-title} cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* If you want to prune the default catalog and selectively mirror only a subset of Operators, install the xref:../../cli_reference/opm-cli.adoc#opm-cli[`opm` CLI].

[NOTE]
====
If you are using OLM in a restricted network on IBM Z, you must have at least 12 GB allocated to the directory where you place your registry.
