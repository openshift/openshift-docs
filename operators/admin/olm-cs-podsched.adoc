toc::[]

When an Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) catalog source of source type `grpc` defines a `spec.image`, the Catalog Operator creates a pod that serves the defined image content. By default, this pod defines the following in its spec:

* Only the `kubernetes.io/os=linux` node selector
* No priority class name
* No tolerations

As an administrator, you can override these values by modifying fields in the `CatalogSource` object's optional `spec.grpcPodConfig` section.
