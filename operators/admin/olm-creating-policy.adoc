= Allowing non-cluster administrators to install Operators

Operators can require wide privileges to run, and the required privileges can
change between versions. Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) runs with
`cluster-admin` privileges. By default, Operator authors can specify any set of
permissions in the ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) and OLM will consequently grant
it to the Operator.

Cluster administrators should take measures to ensure that an Operator cannot
achieve cluster-scoped privileges and that users cannot escalate privileges
using OLM. One method for locking this down requires cluster administrators
auditing Operators before they are added to the cluster. Cluster administrators
are also provided tools for determining and constraining which actions are
allowed during an Operator installation or upgrade using service accounts.

By associating an OperatorGroup with a service account that has a set of
privileges granted to it, cluster administrators can set policy on Operators to
ensure they operate only within predetermined boundaries using RBAC rules. The
Operator is unable to do anything that is not explicitly permitted by those
rules.

This self-sufficient, limited scope installation of Operators by non-cluster
administrators means that more of the Operator Framework tools can safely be
made available to more users, providing a richer experience for building
applications with Operators.
