Understanding the state of the system in Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) is
important for making decisions about and debugging problems with installed
Operators. OLM provides insight into Subscriptions and related Catalog Source
resources regarding their state and actions performed. This helps users better
understand the healthiness of their Operators.
