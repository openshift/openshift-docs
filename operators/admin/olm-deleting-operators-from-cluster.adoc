toc::[]

The following describes how to delete, or uninstall, Operators that were previously installed using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) on your {product-title} cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must successfully and completely uninstall an Operator prior to attempting to reinstall the same Operator. Failure to fully uninstall the Operator properly can leave resources, such as a project or namespace, stuck in a "Terminating" state and cause "error resolving resource" messages to be observed when trying to reinstall the Operator.
