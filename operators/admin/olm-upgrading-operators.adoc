As a cluster administrator, you can upgrade Operators that have been previously installed using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) on your {product-title} cluster.


[IMPORTANT]
====
The upgrade from OpenShift sandboxed containers 1.2 to 1.3 does not upgrade all 1.2 resources. The monitor pods (metrics) continue to run 1.2 images, and `KataConfig` is not be updated to the new version. You must upgrade the images manually once the upgrade is complete. You will also need to manually patch `KataConfig`, or delete and recreate it, to apply the new functionality and bug fixes to the Operator.


The upgrade from OpenShift sandboxed containers 1.2 to 1.3 does not upgrade the `KataConfig` custom resource. As a result, the monitor pods (metrics) are not restarted and continue to run version 1.2 images.

Following the upgrade, manually upgrade the monitor image by either editing the `KataConfig` YAML in the web console, or running the following CLI command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch kataconfig example-kataconfig --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"kataMonitorImage":"registry.redhat.io/openshift-sandboxed-containers/osc-monitor-rhel8:1.3.0"}}'
----

Next, manually patch `KataConfig`, or delete and recreate it, to apply the new functionality and bug fixes to the Operator.
