As a cluster administrator, you can update Operators that have been previously installed using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) on your {product-title} cluster.

[NOTE]
====
For information on how OLM handles updates for installed Operators colocated in the same namespace, as well as an alternative method for installing Operators with custom global Operator groups, see xref:../../operators/understanding/olm/olm-colocation.adoc#olm-colocation[Multitenancy and Operator colocation].
