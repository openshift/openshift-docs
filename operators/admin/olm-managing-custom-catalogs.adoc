This guide describes how to work with custom catalogs for Operators packaged using the xref:../../operators/understanding/olm-packaging-format.adoc#olm-bundle-format_olm-packaging-format[bundle format] on Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) in {product-title}.

[NOTE]
====
Support for the legacy _package manifest format_ for Operators, including custom catalogs that were using the legacy format, is removed in {product-title} 4.8 and later.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Kubernetes periodically deprecates certain APIs that are removed in subsequent releases. As a result, Operators are unable to use removed APIs starting with the version of {product-title} that uses the Kubernetes version that removed the API.

If your cluster is using custom catalogs, see xref:../../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-working-bundle-images#osdk-control-compat_osdk-working-bundle-images[Controlling Operator compatibility with {product-title} versions] for more details about how Operator authors can update their projects to help avoid workload issues and prevent incompatible upgrades.
