Cluster administrators and Operator catalog maintainers can create and managing custom catalogs packaged using the xref:../../operators/understanding/olm-packaging-format.adoc#olm-bundle-format_olm-packaging-format[bundle format] on Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) in {product-title}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Kubernetes periodically deprecates certain APIs that are removed in subsequent releases. As a result, Operators are unable to use removed APIs starting with the version of {product-title} that uses the Kubernetes version that removed the API.

If your cluster is using custom catalogs, see xref:../../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-working-bundle-images#osdk-control-compat_osdk-working-bundle-images[Controlling Operator compatibility with {product-title} versions] for more details about how Operator authors can update their projects to help avoid workload issues and prevent incompatible upgrades.

== File-based catalogs

_File-based catalogs_ are the latest iteration of the catalog format in Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). It is a plain text-based (JSON or YAML) and declarative config evolution of the earlier SQLite database format, and it is fully backwards compatible.

[IMPORTANT]
====
As of {product-title} 4.11, the default Red Hat-provided Operator catalog releases in the file-based catalog format. The default Red Hat-provided Operator catalogs for {product-title} 4.6 through 4.10 released in the deprecated SQLite database format.

The `opm` subcommands, flags, and functionality related to the SQLite database format are also deprecated and will be removed in a future release. The features are still supported and must be used for catalogs that use the deprecated SQLite database format.

Many of the `opm` subcommands and flags for working with the SQLite database format, such as `opm index prune`, do not work with the file-based catalog format. For more information about working with file-based catalogs, see xref:../../operators/understanding/olm-packaging-format.adoc#olm-file-based-catalogs_olm-packaging-format[Operator Framework packaging format] and xref:../../installing/disconnected_install/installing-mirroring-disconnected.adoc#installing-mirroring-disconnected[Mirroring images for a disconnected installation using the oc-mirror plugin].
