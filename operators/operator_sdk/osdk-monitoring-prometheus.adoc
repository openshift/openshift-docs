// Dedicated-admins in OSD and ROSA don't have the permissions to complete the procedures in this assembly. Also, the procedures use the default Prometheus Operator in the openshift-monitoring project, which OSD/ROSA customers should not use.

This guide describes the built-in monitoring support provided by the Operator SDK using the Prometheus Operator and details usage for authors of Go-based and Ansible-based Operators.

// Since OSD/ROSA dedicated-admins can't do the procedures in this assembly, point to the OCP docs.
The Operator SDK provides built-in monitoring support using the Prometheus Operator, which you can use to expose custom metrics for your Operator.

[WARNING]
====
By default, {product-title} provides a Prometheus Operator in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project. You should use this Prometheus instance to monitor user workloads in {product-title}.

Do not use the Prometheus Operator in the `openshift-monitoring` project. Red Hat Site Reliability Engineers (SRE) use this Prometheus instance to monitor core cluster components.
