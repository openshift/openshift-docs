Operator authors should validate that their Operator is packaged correctly and

* You can either set `cr-manifest` or your CSV's
`metadata.annotations['alm-examples']` to provide CRs to the scorecard, but not
both. See xref:../../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-generating-csvs.adoc#osdk-crds-templates_osdk-generating-csvs[CRD templates]
