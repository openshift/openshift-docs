During the lifecycle of an Operator, it is possible that there may be more than one instance running at any given time, for example when rolling out an upgrade for the Operator. In such a scenario, it is necessary to avoid contention between multiple Operator instances using leader election. This ensures only one leader instance handles the reconciliation while the other instances are inactive but ready to take over when the leader steps down.

There are two different leader election implementations to choose from, each with its own trade-off:

Leader-for-life:: The leader pod only gives up leadership, using garbage collection, when it is deleted. This implementation precludes the possibility of two instances mistakenly running as leaders, a state also known as split brain. However, this method can be subject to a delay in electing a new leader. For example, when the leader pod is on an unresponsive or partitioned node, the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-controller-manager/#options[`pod-eviction-timeout`] dictates long how it takes for the leader pod to be deleted from the node and step down, with a default of `5m`. See the link:https://godoc.org/github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pkg/leader[Leader-for-life] Go documentation for more.

Leader-with-lease:: The leader pod periodically renews the leader lease and gives up leadership when it cannot renew the lease. This implementation allows for a faster transition to a new leader when the existing leader is isolated, but there is a possibility of split brain in link:https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/blob/30b06a83d67458700a5378239df6b96948cb9160/tools/leaderelection/leaderelection.go#L21-L24[certain situations]. See the link:https://godoc.org/github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/pkg/leaderelection[Leader-with-lease] Go documentation for more.

By default, the Operator SDK enables the Leader-for-life implementation. Consult the related Go documentation for both approaches to consider the trade-offs that make sense for your use case.
