A _ClusterServiceVersion_ (CSV) is a YAML manifest created from Operator
metadata that assists Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) in running the Operator
in a cluster. It is the metadata that accompanies an Operator container image,
used to populate user interfaces with information such as its logo, description,
and version. It is also a source of technical information that is required to
run the Operator, like the RBAC rules it requires and which Custom Resources
(CRs) it manages or depends on.

The Operator SDK includes the `generate csv` subcommand to generate a
_ClusterServiceVersion_ (CSV) for the current Operator project customized using
information contained in manually-defined YAML manifests and Operator source
files.

A CSV-generating command removes the responsibility of Operator authors having
in-depth OLM knowledge in order for their Operator to interact with OLM or
publish metadata to the Catalog Registry. Further, because the CSV spec will
likely change over time as new Kubernetes and OLM features are implemented, the
Operator SDK is equipped to easily extend its update system to handle new CSV
features going forward.

The CSV version is the same as the Operator's, and a new CSV is generated when
upgrading Operator versions. Operator authors can use the `--csv-version` flag
to have their Operators' state encapsulated in a CSV with the supplied semantic version:

[source,terminal]
----
$ operator-sdk generate csv --csv-version <version>
----

This action is idempotent and only updates the CSV file when a new version is
supplied, or a YAML manifest or source file is changed. Operator authors should
not have to directly modify most fields in a CSV manifest. Those that require
modification are defined in this guide. For example, the CSV version must be
included in `metadata.name`.

TODO: discuss whether multiple CSV files can be present, each with a unique file name (ex. `app-operator.csv.0.1.1.yaml`), or a single `app-operator.csv.yaml` file that relies on VCS (git) to version the file.
