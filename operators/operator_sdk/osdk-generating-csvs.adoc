A _cluster service version_ (CSV), defined by a `ClusterServiceVersion` object, is a YAML manifest created from Operator metadata that assists Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) in running the Operator in a cluster. It is the metadata that accompanies an Operator container image, used to populate user interfaces with information such as its logo, description, and version. It is also a source of technical information that is required to run the Operator, like the RBAC rules it requires and which custom resources (CRs) it manages or depends on.

The Operator SDK includes the CSV generator to generate a CSV for the current Operator project, customized using information contained in YAML manifests and Operator source files.

A CSV-generating command removes the responsibility of Operator authors having in-depth OLM knowledge in order for their Operator to interact with OLM or publish metadata to the Catalog Registry. Further, because the CSV spec will likely change over time as new Kubernetes and OLM features are implemented, the Operator SDK is equipped to easily extend its update system to handle new CSV features going forward.

////
Operator authors can use the `--csv-version` flag to have their Operator state encapsulated in a CSV with the supplied semantic version:

[source,terminal]
----
$ operator-sdk generate csv --csv-version <version>
----

This action is idempotent and only updates the CSV file when a new version is supplied, or a YAML manifest or source file is changed. Operator authors should not have to directly modify most fields in a CSV manifest. Those that require modification are defined in this guide. For example, the CSV version must be included in `metadata.name`.

TODO: discuss whether multiple CSV files can be present, each with a unique file name (ex. `app-operator.csv.0.1.1.yaml`), or a single `app-operator.csv.yaml` file that relies on VCS (git) to version the file.
