A _ClusterServiceVersion_ (CSV) is a YAML manifest created from Operator
metadata that assists the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) in running the
Operator in a cluster. It is the metadata that accompanies an Operator container
image, used to populate user interfaces with information like its logo,
description, and version. It is also a source of technical information that is required to
run the Operator, like the RBAC rules it requires and which Custom Resources
(CRs) it manages or depends on.

The Operator SDK includes the `olm-catalog gen-csv` subcommand to generate a
_ClusterServiceVersion_ (CSV) for the current Operator project customized using
information contained in manually-defined YAML manifests and Operator source
files.

A CSV-generating command removes the responsibility of Operator authors having
in-depth Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) knowledge in order for their Operator
to interact with OLM or publish metadata to the Catalog Registry. Further,
because the CSV spec will likely change over time as new Kubernetes and OLM
features are implemented, the Operator SDK is equipped to easily extend its
update system to handle new CSV features going forward.

The CSV version is the same as the Operator's, and a new CSV is generated when
upgrading Operator versions. Operator authors can use the `--csv-version` flag
to have their Operators' state encapsulated in a CSV with the supplied semantic version:

----
$ operator-sdk olm-catalog gen-csv --csv-version <version>
----
This action is idempotent and only updates the CSV file when a new version is
supplied, or a YAML manifest or source file is changed. Operator authors should
not have to directly modify most fields in a CSV manifest. Those that require
modification are defined in this guide. For example, the CSV version must be
included in `metadata.name`.

TODO: discuss whether multiple CSV files can be present, each with a unique file name (ex. `app-operator.csv.0.1.1.yaml`), or a single `app-operator.csv.yaml` file that relies on VCS (git) to version the file.
