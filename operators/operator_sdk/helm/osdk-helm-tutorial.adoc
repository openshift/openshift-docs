Operator developers can take advantage of link:https://helm.sh/docs/[Helm] support in the Operator SDK to build an example Helm-based Operator for Nginx and manage its lifecycle. This tutorial walks through the following process:

* Create a Nginx deployment
* Ensure that the deployment size is the same as specified by the `Nginx` custom resource (CR) spec
* Update the `Nginx` CR status using the status writer with the names of the `nginx` pods

This process is accomplished using two centerpieces of the Operator Framework:

Operator SDK:: The `operator-sdk` CLI tool and `controller-runtime` library API

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM):: Installation, upgrade, and role-based access control (RBAC) of Operators on a cluster
