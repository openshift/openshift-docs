toc::[]

Operator developers can take advantage of Go programming language support in the Operator SDK to build an example Go-based Operator for Memcached, a distributed key-value store, and manage its lifecycle.

This process is accomplished using two centerpieces of the Operator Framework:

Operator SDK:: The `operator-sdk` CLI tool and `controller-runtime` library API

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM):: Installation, upgrade, and role-based access control (RBAC) of Operators on a cluster
