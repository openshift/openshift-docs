Operator developers can take advantage of Go programming language support in the Operator SDK to build an example Go-based Operator for Memcached, a distributed key-value store, and manage its lifecycle.

[NOTE]
====
link:https://kubebuilder.io/[Kubebuilder] is embedded into the Operator SDK as the scaffolding solution for Go-based Operators.

== Getting involved

This guide provides an effective demonstration of the value of the Operator Framework for building and managing Operators, but this is much more left out in the interest of brevity. The Operator Framework and its components are open source, so visit each project individually and learn what else you can do:

If you want to discuss your experience, have questions, or want to get involved, join the link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/operator-framework[Operator Framework mailing list].
