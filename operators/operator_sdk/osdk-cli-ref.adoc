The Operator SDK command-line interface (CLI) is a development kit designed to make writing Operators easier.

.Operator SDK CLI syntax
[source,terminal]
----
$ operator-sdk <command> [<subcommand>] [<argument>] [<flags>]
----

Operator authors with cluster administrator access to a Kubernetes-based cluster (such as {product-title}) can use the Operator SDK CLI to develop their own Operators based on Go, Ansible, or Helm. link:https://kubebuilder.io/[Kubebuilder] is embedded into the Operator SDK as the scaffolding solution for Go-based Operators, which means existing Kubebuilder projects can be used as is with the Operator SDK and continue to work.
