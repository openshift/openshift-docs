An {product-title} cluster can be configured in high-availability (HA) mode, which uses multiple nodes, or in non-HA mode, which uses a single node. A single node cluster, also known as Single Node OpenShift (SNO), is likely to have more conservative resource constraints. Therefore, it is important that Operators installed on a single node cluster can adjust accordingly and still run well.

By accessing the cluster high-availability mode API provided in {product-title}, Operator authors can use the Operator SDK to enable their Operator to detect a cluster's infrastructure topology, either HA or non-HA mode. Custom Operator logic can be developed that uses the detected cluster topology to automatically switch the resource requirements, both for the Operator and for any Operands or workloads it manages, to a profile that best fits the topology.
