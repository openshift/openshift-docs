{product-title} {product-version} supports Operator SDK {osdk_ver}. If you already have the {osdk_ver_n1} CLI installed on your workstation, you can upgrade the CLI to {osdk_ver} by xref:../../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-installing-cli.adoc#osdk-installing-cli[installing the latest version].

However, to ensure your existing Operator projects maintain compatibility with Operator SDK {osdk_ver}, upgrade steps are required for the associated breaking changes introduced since {osdk_ver_n1}. You must perform the upgrade steps manually in any of your Operator projects that were previously created or maintained with {osdk_ver_n1}.

== Known issues

* The `ansible-operator` binary rejects the `kubeconfig` file if the server URL contains a path. There is currently no workaround other than running the Operator as a pod in the cluster, in which case it uses the internal endpoint. The fix for this issue is currently blocked waiting on a fix to the `apimachinery` package. See link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/issues/4925[operator-framework/operator-sdk#4925] for more details.
