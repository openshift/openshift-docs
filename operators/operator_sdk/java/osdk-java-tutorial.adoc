Operator developers can take advantage of Java programming language support in the Operator SDK to build an example Java-based Operator for Memcached, a distributed key-value store, and manage its lifecycle.

This process is accomplished using two centerpieces of the Operator Framework:

Operator SDK:: The `operator-sdk` CLI tool and `java-operator-sdk` library API

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM):: Installation, upgrade, and role-based access control (RBAC) of Operators on a cluster

- See xref:../../../operators/operator_sdk/java/osdk-java-project-layout.adoc#osdk-java-project-layout[Project layout for Java-based Operators] to learn about the directory structures created by the Operator SDK.
- If a xref:../../../networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy.adoc#enable-cluster-wide-proxy[cluster-wide egress proxy is configured], cluster administrators can xref:../../../operators/admin/olm-configuring-proxy-support.adoc#olm-configuring-proxy-support[override the proxy settings or inject a custom CA certificate] for specific Operators running on Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).
