// This assembly is not currrently included in the OSD and ROSA distros, because it is Tech Preview. However, some conditionalization has been added for OSD and ROSA so that the content will be applicable to those distros once this feature is GA and included in the OSD and ROSA docs.

toc::[]

Operator developers can take advantage of Java programming language support in the Operator SDK to build an example Java-based Operator for Memcached, a distributed key-value store, and manage its lifecycle.

include::snippets/osdk-deprecation.adoc[]

This process is accomplished using two centerpieces of the Operator Framework:

Operator SDK:: The `operator-sdk` CLI tool and `java-operator-sdk` library API

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM):: Installation, upgrade, and role-based access control (RBAC) of Operators on a cluster
