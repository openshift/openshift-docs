toc::[]

{product-title} {product-version} supports Operator SDK {osdk_ver}. If you already have the {osdk_ver_n1} CLI installed on your workstation, you can update the CLI to {osdk_ver} by xref:../../../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-installing-cli.adoc#osdk-installing-cli[installing the latest version].

include::snippets/osdk-deprecation.adoc[]

However, to ensure your existing Operator projects maintain compatibility with Operator SDK {osdk_ver}, update steps are required for the associated breaking changes introduced since {osdk_ver_n1}. You must perform the update steps manually in any of your Operator projects that were previously created or maintained with {osdk_ver_n1}.
