Operator developers can take advantage of link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html[Ansible] support in the Operator SDK to build an example Ansible-based Operator for Memcached, a distributed key-value store, and manage its lifecycle. This tutorial walks through the following process:

* Create a Memcached deployment
* Ensure that the deployment size is the same as specified by the `Memcached` custom resource (CR) spec
* Update the `Memcached` CR status using the status writer with the names of the `memcached` pods

This process is accomplished by using two centerpieces of the Operator Framework:

Operator SDK:: The `operator-sdk` CLI tool and `controller-runtime` library API

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM):: Installation, upgrade, and role-based access control (RBAC) of Operators on a cluster
