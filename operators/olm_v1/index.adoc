{olm-first} has been included with {product-title} 4 since its initial release. {product-title} 4.16 includes components for a next-generation iteration of {olm} as a Technology Preview feature, known during this phase as _{olmv1}_. This updated framework evolves many of the concepts that have been part of previous versions of {olm} and adds new capabilities.

== Highlights

During this Technology Preview phase of {olmv1} in {product-title} 4.16, administrators can explore the following highlights:

Fully declarative model that supports GitOps workflows::
{olmv1} simplifies extension management through two key APIs:
+
--
* A new `ClusterExtension` API streamlines management of installed extensions, which includes Operators via the `registry+v1` bundle format, by consolidating user-facing APIs into a single object. This API, provided as `clusterextension.olm.operatorframework.io` by the new Operator Controller component, empowers administrators and SREs to automate processes and define desired states by using GitOps principles.
+
[NOTE]
====
Earlier Technology Preview phases of {olmv1} introduced a new `Operator` API; this API is renamed `ClusterExtension` in {product-title} 4.16 to address the following:

* Signals that {olmv1} encompasses more than only Operators
* Avoids the issue of the separate `Operator` API available in {olmv0}, which caused user experience conflicts, for example with `oc <verb> operators` commands
* `Cluster` prefix clearly indicates that `ClusterExtension` objects are cluster-scoped, a change from {olmv0} where Operators could be either namespace-scoped or cluster-scoped
====
* The `Catalog` API, provided by the new catalogd component, serves as the foundation for {olmv1}, unpacking catalogs for on-cluster clients so that users can discover installable content, such as Kubernetes extensions and Operators. This provides increased visibility into all available Operator bundle versions, including their details, channels, and update edges.

Improved control over extension updates::
With improved insight into catalog content, administrators can specify target versions for installation and updates. This grants administrators more control over the target version of extension updates. For more information, see xref:../../operators/olm_v1/olmv1-installing-an-operator-from-a-catalog.adoc#olmv1-updating-an-operator_olmv1-installing-operator[Updating an Operator].

Flexible extension packaging format::
Administrators can use file-based catalogs to install and manage extensions, such as {olm}-based Operators, similar to the {olmv0} experience.
+
In addition, bundle size is no longer constrained by the etcd value size limit. For more information, see xref:../../operators/olm_v1/olmv1-installing-an-operator-from-a-catalog.adoc#olmv1-installing-an-operator-from-a-catalog[Installing an Operator from a catalog].
