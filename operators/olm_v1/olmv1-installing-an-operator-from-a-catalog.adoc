toc::[]

Cluster administrators can add _catalogs_, or curated collections of Operators and Kubernetes extensions, to their clusters. Operator authors publish their products to these catalogs. When you add a catalog to your cluster, you have access to the versions, patches, and over-the-air updates of the Operators and extensions that are published to the catalog.

In the current Technology Preview release of {olmv1-first}, you manage catalogs and Operators declaratively from the CLI using custom resources (CRs).
