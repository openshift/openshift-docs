= Installing an Operator from a catalog in OLM 1.0 (Technology Preview)

:context: olmv1-installing-operator

toc::[]

Cluster administrators can add _catalogs_, or curated collections of Operators and Kubernetes extensions, to their clusters. Operator authors publish their products to these catalogs. When you add a catalog to your cluster, you have access to versions, patches, and over-the-air updates of the Operators and extensions that are published in the catalog. 

In the current Technology Preview release of Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0, you manage catalogs and Operators from the CLI using custom resources (CRs).
