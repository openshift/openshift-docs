toc::[]

Cluster administrators can add _catalogs_, or curated collections of Operators and Kubernetes extensions, to their clusters. Operator authors publish their products to these catalogs. When you add a catalog to your cluster, you have access to the versions, patches, and over-the-air updates of the Operators and extensions that are published to the catalog.

In the current Technology Preview release of {olmv1-first}, you manage catalogs and Operators declaratively from the CLI using custom resources (CRs).

[id="prerequisites_{context}"]
== Prerequisites

* Access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions
+
--
include::snippets/olmv1-cli-only.adoc[]
--
* The `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set enabled on the cluster
+
[WARNING]
====
Enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set cannot be undone and prevents minor version updates. These feature sets are not recommended on production clusters.
====
* The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) installed on your workstation

[id="upgrade-constraint-semantics_{context}"]
== Upgrade constraint semantics

When determining upgrade edges for an installed cluster extension, {olmv1-first} supports {olmv0} semantics starting in {product-title} 4.16. This support follows the behavior from {olmv0}, including `replaces`, `skips`, and `skipRange` directives, with a few noted differences.

By supporting {olmv0} semantics, {olmv1} now honors the upgrade graph from catalogs accurately.

.Differences from original {olmv0} implementation

* If there are multiple possible successors, {olmv1} behavior differs in the following ways:
** In {olmv0}, the successor closest to the channel head is chosen.
** In {olmv1}, the successor with the highest semantic version (semver) is chosen.

* Consider the following set of file-based catalog (FBC) channel entries:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
- name: example.v3.0.0
  skips: ["example.v2.0.0"]
- name: example.v2.0.0
  skipRange: >=1.0.0 <2.0.0
----
+
If `1.0.0` is installed, {olmv1} behavior differs in the following ways:
+
--
** {olmv0-caps} will not see an upgrade edge to `v2.0.0` because `v2.0.0` is skipped and not on the `replaces` chain.
** {olmv1} will see the upgrade edge because {olmv1} does not have a concept of a `replaces` chain. {olmv1} finds all entries that have a `replace`, `skip`, or `skipRange` value that covers the currently installed version.
--

[NOTE]
====
Support for semantic versioning (semver) upgrade constraints was introduced in {product-title} 4.15 but disabled in 4.16 in favor of {olmv0} semantics during this Technology Preview phase.
