Validating and mutating admission webhooks allow Operator authors to intercept,
modify, and accept or reject resources before they are saved to the object store
and handled by the Operator controller. Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) can
manage the lifecycle of these webhooks when they are shipped alongside your
Operator.
