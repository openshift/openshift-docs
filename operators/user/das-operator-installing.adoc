[role="_abstract"]
The Dynamic Accelerator Slicer (DAS) Operator dynamically partitions GPU accelerators in {product-title}. It provides on-demand partitioning of GPUs via a custom Kubernetes operator with scheduler integration that allocates NVIDIA Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) slices through a plugin.

You can install the DAS Operator on {product-title} 4.18.21 and later versions.

== Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.
* Your cluster has GPU hardware available.
* Your cluster has the xref:../../installing/overview/cluster-capabilities.adoc#operator-marketplace_cluster-capabilities[Marketplace capability] enabled or the Red Hat Operator catalog source configured manually.

The following components must be installed before installing the DAS Operator:

* **Cert-manager**: Required for certificate management
* **Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Operator**: Required for detecting GPU hardware features
* **NVIDIA GPU Operator**: Required for GPU hardware management
