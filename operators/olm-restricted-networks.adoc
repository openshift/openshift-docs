= Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks

toc::[]

When {product-title} is installed on restricted networks, also known as a
disconnected cluster, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) can no longer use the
default OperatorHub sources because they require full Internet connectivity.
Cluster administrators can disable those default sources and create local
mirrors so that OLM can install and manage Operators from the local sources
instead.

[IMPORTANT]
====
While OLM can manage Operators from local sources, the ability for a given
Operator to run successfully in a restricted network still depends on the
Operator itself. The Operator must:

* List any related images, or other container images that the Operator might
require to perform their functions, in the `relatedImages` parameter of its
ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) object.
* Reference all specified images by a digest (SHA) and not by a tag.

See the following Red Hat Knowledgebase Article for a list of Red Hat Operators
that support running in disconnected mode:
