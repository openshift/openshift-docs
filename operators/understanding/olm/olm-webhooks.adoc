Webhooks allow Operator authors to intercept, modify, and accept or reject
resources before they are saved to the object store and handled by the Operator
controller. Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) can manage the lifecycle of these
webhooks when they are shipped alongside your Operator.

See
xref:../../../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-generating-csvs.adoc#olm-defining-csv-webhook_osdk-generating-csvs[Generating a ClusterServiceVersion (CSV)]
for details on how an Operator developer can define webhooks for their Operator,
as well as considerations when running on OLM.
