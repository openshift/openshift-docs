toc::[]

The default behavior for Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) aims to provide simplicity during Operator installation. However, this behavior can lack flexibility, especially in multitenant clusters. In order for multiple tenants on a {product-title} cluster to use an Operator, the default behavior of OLM requires that administrators install the Operator in *All namespaces* mode, which can be considered to violate the principle of least privilege.

Consider the following scenarios to determine which Operator installation workflow works best for your environment and requirements.

== Operator colocation and Operator groups

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) handles OLM-managed Operators that are installed in the same namespace, meaning their `Subscription` resources are colocated in the same namespace, as related Operators. Even if they are not actually related, OLM considers their states, such as their version and update policy, when any one of them is updated.

For more information on Operator colocation and using Operator groups effectively, see xref:../../operators/understanding/olm/olm-colocation.adoc#olm-colocation[Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) -> Multitenancy and Operator colocation].
