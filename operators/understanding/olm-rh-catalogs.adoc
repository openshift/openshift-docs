toc::[]

Red Hat provides several Operator catalogs that are included with {product-title} by default.

[IMPORTANT]
====
As of {product-title} 4.11, the default Red Hat-provided Operator catalog releases in the file-based catalog format. The default Red Hat-provided Operator catalogs for {product-title} 4.6 through 4.10 released in the deprecated SQLite database format.

The `opm` subcommands, flags, and functionality related to the SQLite database format are also deprecated and will be removed in a future release. The features are still supported and must be used for catalogs that use the deprecated SQLite database format.

Many of the `opm` subcommands and flags for working with the SQLite database format, such as `opm index prune`, do not work with the file-based catalog format.
