This guide outlines the packaging format for Operators supported by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) in {product-title}.

[NOTE]
====
Support for the legacy _package manifest format_ for Operators is removed in {product-title} 4.8 and later. Existing Operator projects in the package manifest format can be migrated to the bundle format by using the Operator SDK `pkgman-to-bundle` command. See xref:../../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-pkgman-to-bundle.adoc#osdk-pkgman-to-bundle[Migrating package manifest projects to bundle format] for more details.
