:FeatureName: `InsightsOperatorPullingSCA`

toc::[]

Insights Operator periodically imports your simple content access certificates from {cluster-manager-url} and stores them in the `etc-pki-entitlement` secret in the `openshift-config-managed` namespace. Simple content access is a capability in Red Hat subscription tools which simplifies the behavior of the entitlement tooling. This feature makes it easier to consume the content provided by your Red Hat subscriptions without the complexity of configuring subscription tooling.

Insights Operator imports simple content access certificates every 8 hours by default, but can be configured or disabled using the `support` secret in the `openshift-config` namespace.
