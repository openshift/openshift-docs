You can install Red Hat {ProductName} on {product-title} in either of two ways:

* You can install Red Hat {ProductName} as part of Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh. Distributed tracing platform is included by default in the Service Mesh installation.  To install distributed tracing platform as part of a service mesh, follow the xref:../../service_mesh/v2x/preparing-ossm-installation.adoc#preparing-ossm-installation[Red Hat Service Mesh Installation] instructions. {ProductName} must be installed in the same namespace as your service mesh, that is, the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` and the distributed tracing platform resources must be in the same namespace.

* If you do not want to install a service mesh, you can use the {ProductName}  operator to install {ProductName} by itself.  To install distributed tracing platform without a service mesh, use the following instructions.

== Prerequisites
