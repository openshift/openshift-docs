{logging-uc} {for} is an opinionated collector and normalizer of application, infrastructure, and audit logs. It is intended to be used for forwarding logs to various supported systems.

{logging-uc} is not:

* Security Information and Event Monitoring (SIEM) compliant
* A "bring your own" (BYO) log collector configuration
* Historical or long term log retention or storage
* A guaranteed log sink
* Secure storage - audit logs are not stored by default

== Collecting {logging} data for Red Hat Support

When opening a support case, it is helpful to provide debugging information about your cluster to Red{nbsp}Hat Support.

You can use the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/support/gathering-cluster-data.html#gathering-cluster-data[must-gather tool] to collect diagnostic information for project-level resources, cluster-level resources, and each of the {logging} components.
For prompt support, supply diagnostic information for both {ocp-product-title} and {logging}.
