Kiali provided by Red Hat is composed of three parts:

{SMProduct} integrates with the following:

* Observability components such as:
** OpenShift Monitoring
** {DTProductname}
** {OTELOperator}
* cert-manager
* Argo rollouts
// * Integration of {SMProduct} with 3rd party components that support community Istio integrations --> commented out as none are currently documented in prod docs that are not supported by Red Hat, but support may change.
