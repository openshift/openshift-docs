toc::[]

{ServerlessProductName} provides Kubernetes native building blocks that enable developers to create and deploy serverless, event-driven applications on {ocp-product-title}. {ServerlessProductName} is based on the open source link:https://knative.dev/docs/[Knative project], which provides portability and consistency for hybrid and multi-cloud environments by enabling an enterprise-grade serverless platform.

[NOTE]
====
Because {ServerlessProductName} releases on a different cadence from {product-title}, the {ServerlessProductName} documentation is now available as separate documentation sets for each minor version of the product. 

The {ServerlessProductName} documentation is available at link:https://docs.openshift.com/serverless/[].

Documentation for specific versions is available using the version selector drop-down list, or directly by adding the version to the URL, for example, link:https://docs.openshift.com/serverless/1.28[].

In addition, the {ServerlessProductName} documentation is also available on the Red Hat Customer Portal at https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_serverless/[].

For additional information about the {ServerlessProductName} life cycle and supported platforms, refer to the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#ossrvless[Platform Life Cycle Policy].
