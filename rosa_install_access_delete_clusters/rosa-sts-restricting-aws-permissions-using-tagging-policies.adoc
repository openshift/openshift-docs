toc::[]

When you create a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster that uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS), a default `red-hat-managed=true` policy tag is applied to the STS IAM resources. You can create tagging policies for this default tag to permit clusters and the Red Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team to manage only the resources required for your clusters.
