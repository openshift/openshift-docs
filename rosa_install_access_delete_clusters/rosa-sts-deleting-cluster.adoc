= Deleting a ROSA cluster
:context: rosa-sts-deleting-cluster

toc::[]

This document provides steps to delete a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster that uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS). After deleting your cluster, you can also delete the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources that are used by the cluster.

[id="prerequisites_rosa-sts-deleting-cluster"]
== Prerequisites

* If {product-title} created a VPC, you must remove the following items from your cluster before you can successfully delete your cluster:
** Network configurations, such as VPN configurations and VPC peering connections
** Any additional services that were added to the VPC

If these configurations and services remain, the cluster does not delete properly.
