= Deleting a ROSA cluster
:context: rosa-sts-deleting-cluster

toc::[]

This document provides steps to delete a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster that uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS). After deleting your cluster, you can also delete the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources that are used by the cluster.

[id="prerequisites_rosa-sts-deleting-cluster"]
== Prerequisites

* If {product-title} created a VPC, you must remove the following items from your cluster before you can successfully delete your cluster:
** Network configurations, such as VPN configurations and VPC peering connections
** Any additional services that were added to the VPC

If these configurations and services remain, the cluster does not delete properly.

.Troubleshooting
* If the cluster cannot be deleted because of missing IAM roles, see Additional xref:../support/troubleshooting/rosa-troubleshooting-deployments.adoc#rosa-troubleshooting-cluster-deletion_rosa-troubleshooting-cluster-deployments[Repairing a cluster that cannot be deleted].
* If the cluster cannot be deleted for other reasons:
** Check that there are no Add-ons for your cluster pending in the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift[Hybrid Cloud Console].
** Check that all AWS resources and dependencies have been deleted in the Amazon Web Console.
