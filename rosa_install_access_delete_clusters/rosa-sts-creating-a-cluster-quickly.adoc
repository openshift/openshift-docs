Create a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster quickly by using the default options and automatic AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resource creation. You can deploy your cluster by using {cluster-manager-first} or the ROSA CLI (`rosa`).

The procedures in this document use `auto` mode to immediately create the required IAM resources using the current AWS account, including the account-wide IAM roles and policies, Operator policies, cluster-specific Operator roles, and the OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider.

Alternatively, you can use `manual` mode which outputs the `aws` commands needed to create the IAM resources instead of deploying them automatically. For information about the `auto` and `manual` deployment modes, see xref:../rosa_install_access_delete_clusters/rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-with-customizations.adoc#rosa-understanding-deployment-modes_rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-with-customizations[Understanding the auto and manual deployment modes]. For steps to deploy a ROSA cluster using `manual` mode, see xref:../rosa_install_access_delete_clusters/rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-with-customizations.adoc#rosa-sts-creating-cluster-using-customizations_rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-with-customizations[Creating a cluster using customizations].
