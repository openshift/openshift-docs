toc::[]

You can use Terraform to create a customized {product-title} (ROSA) cluster by using Terraform to customize the cluster's details.

[NOTE]
====
This guide assumes a basic understanding of ROSA. See the "Additional resources" for conceptual information about ROSA clusters.

== Creating a ROSA Classic cluster using Terraform

The following cluster creation process shows how to use Terraform to create your account-wide IAM roles and a default ROSA cluster with a managed OIDC configuration.

[NOTE]
====
You edit the default `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `terraform.tfvars` files to customize a cluster. Cluster customizations must be performed before you create a cluster. To customize, copy the default Terraform file from the procedure below and make the desired changes.
