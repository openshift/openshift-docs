Create a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster quickly by using a Terraform cluster template that is configured with the default cluster options.

If you want to install ROSA clusters with the default options by using the CLI or {cluster-manager-url}, see xref:../rosa_install_access_delete_clusters/rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-quickly.adoc#rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-quickly-ocm_rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-quickly[Creating a ROSA cluster with STS using the default options]. For steps to deploy a ROSA cluster by using `manual` mode or with customizations, see xref:../rosa_install_access_delete_clusters/rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-with-customizations.adoc#rosa-sts-creating-cluster-using-customizations_rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-with-customizations[Creating a ROSA cluster with STS using customizations].

This cluster creation process uses a Terraform configuration that prepares a ROSA Classic AWS Security Token Service (STS) cluster with the following resources:

* OIDC provider with a managed `oidc-config`.
* Prerequisite Operator roles with policies.
* IAM account roles with policies.
* All other AWS resources required to create a ROSA cluster.
