toc::[]

Create a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster with the AWS Security Token Service (STS) using customizations. You can deploy your cluster by using {cluster-manager-first} or the ROSA CLI (`rosa`).

With the procedures in this document, you can also choose between the `auto` and `manual` modes when creating the required AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources.

=== Troubleshooting

If your cluster fails to install, check these common troubleshooting issues:

* Make sure your link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html[DHCP option set] includes a domain name, and ensure that the domain name does not include any spaces or capital letters.
* If your VPC uses a custom DNS resolver (the `domain name servers` field of your DHCP option set is not `AmazonProvideDNS`), make sure it is able to properly resolve the private hosted zones configured in Route53.

For more information about troubleshooting ROSA cluster installations, see xref:../support/troubleshooting/rosa-troubleshooting-installations.adoc#rosa-troubleshooting-installations[Troubleshooting {product-title} installations].
