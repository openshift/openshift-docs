toc::[]

Create a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster with the AWS Security Token Service (STS) using customizations. You can deploy your cluster by using {cluster-manager-first} or the ROSA CLI (`rosa`).

With the procedures in this document, you can also choose between the `auto` and `manual` modes when creating the required AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources.
