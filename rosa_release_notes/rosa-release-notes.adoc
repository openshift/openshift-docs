{product-title} (ROSA) is a fully-managed, turnkey application platform that allows you to focus on delivering value to your customers by building and deploying applications. Red Hat and AWS site reliability engineering (SRE) experts manage the underlying platform so you do not have to worry about the complexity of infrastructure management. ROSA provides seamless integration with a wide range of AWS compute, database, analytics, machine learning, networking, mobile, and other services to further accelerate the building and delivering of differentiating experiences to your customers.

== About this release

{product-title} https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2022:2252[RHEA-2022:2252] is now available. This release uses Kubernetes 1.24 with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} 4.10 are included in this topic.

{product-title} clusters are available at https://console.redhat.com/openshift. With the {cluster-manager-first} application for ROSA, you can deploy {product-title} clusters to either on-premise or cloud environments.

[id="about-this-release_{context}"]
== ROSA layered and dependent component support and compatibility
The scope of support for layered and dependent components of ROSA changes independently of the ROSA version. To determine the current support status and compatibility for an add-on, see the xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-life-cycle.adoc#rosa-life-cycle[{product-title} update life cycle].

[id="rosa-new-features_{context}"]
== New features and enhancements

[id="rosa-product-enhancements_{context}"]
=== Product enhancements

The following list describes the key features of ROSA:

* **ROSA UI wizard**: The new ROSA provisioning wizard UI is now available as an AWS STS-only experience. You can access the new UI wizard at https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/rosa/wizard.

* **Latest CLI and new Operator**: ROSA Command Line Interface (CLI) 1.1.11 was released on March 9, 2022 and enabled the creation of {product-title} 4.10 clusters. Please ensure you are always using the latest ROSA CLI for the best experience. {product-title} 4.10 has a new Operator and cloud network configuration controller. Therefore, a new Operator role and policy will be added when you upgrade to {product-title} 4.10, or it will be a part of new cluster deployments. During an upgrade to {product-title} 4.10, you will be prompted by the ROSA CLI to add a new role and policy.

* **Upgrade handling**: The commands `rosa upgrade cluster` and `rosa upgrade account` roles are seamless and backward compatible with all the older ROSA versions and older {product-title} clusters. When you run these commands, the old {product-title} clusters and their relevant STS roles and policies are updated to the latest versions.

* **New AWS roles supporting the ROSA UI**: The tools to manage the `ocm-role` and `user-role` and use the ROSA provisioning UI are now available in the ROSA CLI as of version 1.2.0. The `ocm-role` and `user-role` are also instrumental in facilitating ROSA STS upgrades done from the {cluster-manager-first} UI only.

[id="rosa-documentation-enhancements_{context}"]
=== Documentation enhancements

The following list describes the key documentation features of ROSA:

* **Getting started with ROSA**: {product-title} 4.10 now includes a getting started guide. Getting Started with ROSA defines basic terminology and provides role-based next steps for developers and administrators. The tutorials walk new users through the web console and the {product-title} CLI interfaces. New users can accomplish the following tasks by using the getting started guide:
  ** Setting up the environment
  ** Creating a {product-title} clusters with STS using the default options
  ** Creating a cluster administrator user for quick cluster access
  ** Configuring an identity provider and granting cluster access
  ** Accessing a cluster through the web console
  ** Deploying an application from the Developer Catalog
  ** Revoking administrator privileges and user access
  ** Deleting a {product-title} cluster and the AWS STS resources

For more information, see xref:../rosa_getting_started/rosa-getting-started.adoc#rosa-getting-started[Getting started with {product-title}].

* **Documentation restructure**: The ROSA product documentation went through two phases of restructuring focused on making the following more intuitive, clear, and findable:
  ** Navigation menu
  ** Book content
  ** Topic flow

In addition, redirects were put in place to help ensure a seamless navigation experience in the ROSA documentation.

[id="technical-changes_{context}"]
== Notable technical changes
{product-title} 4.10 introduces the following notable technical changes.

[id="notable-changes-ephemeral-volumes_{context}"]
=== Encrypted ephemeral instance volumes
Clusters built in July 2022 and later use encrypted ephemeral instances as part of the pre-create cluster workflow. These clusters pass the service control policies (SCPs) that demand encrypted instance volumes only.

[id="notable-changes-throttling-improvements_{context}"]
=== Throttling improvements for ROSA CLI
Delays, intervals, and timeouts were improved to reduce the possibility of requests being throttled when addressing the AWS APIs.

[id="notable-changes-new-commands_{context}"]
=== Addition of new commands
The following commands were added:

* Managing a managed service or appliance: `rosa create|edit managed-service --id=<service> --parameter-key <parameter value>`
* Managing {cluster-manager-first} roles: `rosa create|list|delete ocm-role`
* Managing {cluster-manager-first} users: `rosa create|list|delete user-role`

[id="notable-changes-increased-pod-PID-limit_{context}"]
=== Increased the default per-pod PID limit
As of the {product-title} versions 4.8.35, 4.9.26, 4.10.6, the {product-title} default per-pod PID limit is **4096**. If you want to enable this PID limit, you must upgrade your {product-title} clusters to these versions or later. {product-title} clusters with prior versions use a default PID limit of **1024**.

[id="rosa-deprecated-removed-features_{context}"]
== Deprecated and removed features
Some features available in previous releases have been deprecated or removed. Deprecated functionality is still included in ROSA and continues to be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of this product and is not recommended for new deployments.

[id="rosa-deprecated-feature-nonSTS-deployment_{context}"]
=== ROSA non-STS deployment mode
ROSA non-STS deployment mode is no longer the preferred method for new clusters. Instead, users must deploy ROSA with the STS mode. This deprecation is in line with our new ROSA provisioning wizard UI experience at https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/rosa/wizard.

[id="rosa-bug-fixes_{context}"]
== Bug fixes

[id="rosa-known-issues_{context}"]
=== Known issues
* The `ocm-role` and `user-role` that are key to the ROSA provisioning wizard might get enabled accidentally in your Red Hat organization by another user. However, this behavior does not affect the usability.
* The `htpasswd` identity provider does not function as expected in all scenarios against the `rosa create admin` function. This issue will be addressed in a newer version of the ROSA CLI in a future release.

[id="rosa-fixed-issues_{context}"]
=== Fixed issues
* Previously, if you selected Single-AZ mode for {product-title} clusters, you could select multiple availability zones too. This issue is now fixed and you can specify only one availability zone when you select Single-AZ mode.
