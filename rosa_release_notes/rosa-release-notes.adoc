{product-title} (ROSA) is a fully-managed, turnkey application platform that allows you to focus on delivering value to your customers by building and deploying applications. Red Hat and AWS site reliability engineering (SRE) experts manage the underlying platform so you do not have to worry about the complexity of infrastructure management. ROSA provides seamless integration with a wide range of AWS compute, database, analytics, machine learning, networking, mobile, and other services to further accelerate the building and delivering of differentiating experiences to your customers.

{product-title} clusters are available on the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift[Hybrid Cloud Console]. With the Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager application for ROSA, you can deploy {product-title} clusters to either on-premises or cloud environments.

=== Q4 2023

* **{hcp-title-first}.** {hcp-title} is now generally available. For more information, see xref:../rosa_hcp/rosa-hcp-sts-creating-a-cluster-quickly.adoc#rosa-hcp-sts-creating-a-cluster-quickly[Creating ROSA with HCP clusters using the default options].

* **Configurable process identifier (PID) limits.** With the release of ROSA CLI (`rosa`) version 1.2.31, administrators can use the `rosa create kubeletconfig` and `rosa edit kubeletconfig` commands to set the maximum PIDs for an existing cluster. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7033551[Changing the maximum number of process IDs per pod (podPidsLimit) for ROSA].

* **ROSA CLI update.** The ROSA CLI (`rosa`) was updated to a new version. For information about what has changed in this release, see the link:https://github.com/openshift/rosa/releases/tag/v1.2.31[ROSA CLI release notes]. For more information about the ROSA CLI (`rosa`), see xref:../cli_reference/rosa_cli/rosa-get-started-cli.adoc#rosa-about_rosa-getting-started-cli[About the ROSA CLI].

* **Configure custom security groups.** With the release of ROSA CLI (`rosa`) version 1.2.31, administrators can use the `rosa create cluster` and `rosa create machinepool` commands to configure a new cluster or a new machine pool with up to 5 additional custom security groups. Additionally, administrators can create a new machine pool with up to 5 additional custom security groups by using OpenShift Cluster Manager. Configuring custom security groups gives administrators greater control over resource access in new clusters and machine pools. For more information, see xref:../rosa_install_access_delete_clusters/rosa_getting_started_iam/rosa-aws-prereqs.adoc#rosa-security-groups_prerequisites[Security groups].

* **Command update.** With the release of ROSA CLI (`rosa`) version 1.2.28, a new command, `rosa describe machinepool`, was added that allows you to check detailed information regarding a specific ROSA cluster machine pool. For more information, see xref:../cli_reference/rosa_cli/rosa-manage-objects-cli.adoc#rosa-describe-machinepool_rosa-managing-objects-cli[describe machinepool].

* **Documentation update.** The Operators section was added to the ROSA documentation. Operators are the preferred method of packaging, deploying, and managing services on the control plane. For more information, see xref:../operators/index.adoc[Operators overview].

* **{VirtProductName} support.** The release of {VirtProductName} 4.14 added support for running {VirtProductName} on ROSA Classic clusters. For more information, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/virt/install/preparing-cluster-for-virt.html#virt-aws-bm_preparing-cluster-for-virt[{VirtProductName} on AWS bare metal] in the {OCP} documentation.

* **ROSA CLI update.** The ROSA CLI (`rosa`) was updated to a new version. For information about what has changed in this release, see the link:https://github.com/openshift/rosa/releases/tag/v1.2.27[ROSA CLI release notes]. For more information about the ROSA CLI (`rosa`), see xref:../cli_reference/rosa_cli/rosa-get-started-cli.adoc#rosa-about_rosa-getting-started-cli[About the ROSA CLI].

* **Cluster autoscaling.** You can now enable cluster autoscaling using ROSA clusters. Cluster autoscaling automatically adjusts the size of a cluster so that all pods have a place to run, and there are no unneeded nodes. You can enable autoscaling during and after cluster creation using either OpenShift Cluster Manager or the ROSA CLI (`rosa`). For more information, see xref:../rosa_cluster_admin/rosa-cluster-autoscaling.adoc[Cluster autoscaling].

* **Shared virtual private clouds.** ROSA now supports installing clusters into VPCs shared among AWS accounts that are part of AWS organizations. AWS account installing ROSA cluster can now use shared subnets owned by a management account. For more information, see xref:../rosa_install_access_delete_clusters/rosa-shared-vpc-config.adoc[Configuring a shared virtual private cloud for ROSA clusters].

* **Machine pool disk volume size.** You can now configure your machine pool disk volume size for additional flexibility. You can select your own sizing for the disk volumes of their worker machine pool nodes. For more information, see xref:../rosa_cluster_admin/rosa_nodes/rosa-managing-worker-nodes.adoc#configuring_machine_pool_disk_volumerosa-managing-worker-nodes[Configuring machine pool disk volume].

* **Machine pool update.** You can now add taints to the machine pool that is automatically generated during cluster creation. You can also delete this machine pool. This new feature provides more flexibility and cost-effectiveness for cluster administrators, specifically in regards to scaling infrastructure based on changing resource requirements. For more information, see xref:../rosa_cluster_admin/rosa_nodes/rosa-managing-worker-nodes.adoc#creating_a_machine_pool_rosa-managing-worker-nodes[Creating a machine pool].

* **ROSA regional availability update.** {product-title} (ROSA) is now available in the following regions:
+
** Spain (`eu-south-2`)
** Hyderabad (`ap-south-2`)
** Melbourne (`ap-southeast-4`)
** Zurich (`eu-central-2`)
+
For more information on region availabilities, see xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-service-definition.adoc#rosa-sdpolicy-regions-az_rosa-service-definition[Regions and availability zones].

* **Documentation update.** The CLI Tools section was added to the ROSA documentation and includes more detailed information to help you fully use all of the supported CLI tools. The ROSA CLI section can now be found nested inside the CLI Tools heading. For more information, see xref:../cli_reference/index.adoc[CLI tools overview].

* **Documentation update.** The Monitoring section in the documentation was expanded and now includes more detailed information to help you conveniently manage your ROSA clusters. For more information, see xref:../monitoring/monitoring-overview.adoc#about-openshift-monitoring[About Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS monitoring].

* **OIDC provider endpoint URL update.** Starting with ROSA CLI version 1.2.7, all new cluster OIDC provider endpoint URLs are no longer regional. Amazon CloudFront is part of this implementation to improve access speed, reduce latency, and improve resiliency. This change is only available for new clusters created with ROSA CLI 1.2.7 or later. There are no supported migration paths for existing OIDC provider configurations.

[id="rosa-known-issues_{context}"]
== Known issues
* The OpenShift Cluster Manager roles (`ocm-role`) and user roles (`user-role`) that are key to the ROSA provisioning wizard might get enabled accidentally in your Red Hat organization by another user. However, this behavior does not affect the usability.
* The `htpasswd` identity provider does not function as expected in all scenarios against the `rosa create admin` function.

[id="rosa-deprecated-removed-features_{context}"]
== Deprecated and removed features
Some features available in previous releases have been deprecated or removed. Deprecated functionality is still included in ROSA and continues to be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of this product and is not recommended for new deployments.

* **ROSA non-STS deployment mode.** ROSA non-STS deployment mode is no longer the preferred method for new clusters. Instead, users must deploy ROSA with the STS mode. This deprecation is in line with our new ROSA provisioning wizard UI experience at https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/rosa/wizard.

* **Label removal on core namespaces.** ROSA is no longer labeling OpenShift core using the `name` label. Customers should migrate to referencing the `kubernetes.io/metadata.name` label if needed for Network Policies or other use cases.
