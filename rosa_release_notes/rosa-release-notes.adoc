{product-title} (ROSA) is a fully-managed, turnkey application platform that allows you to focus on delivering value to your customers by building and deploying applications. Red Hat and AWS site reliability engineering (SRE) experts manage the underlying platform so you do not have to worry about the complexity of infrastructure management. ROSA provides seamless integration with a wide range of AWS compute, database, analytics, machine learning, networking, mobile, and other services to further accelerate the building and delivering of differentiating experiences to your customers.

{product-title} clusters are available on the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift[Hybrid Cloud Console]. With the Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager application for ROSA, you can deploy {product-title} clusters to either on-premises or cloud environments.

[id="rosa-q1-2023_{context}"]
=== Q1 2023

* **OIDC provider endpoint URL update:** Starting with ROSA CLI version 1.2.7, all new cluster OIDC provider endpoint URLs are no longer regional. AWS CloudFront is part of this implementation to improve access speed, reduce latency, and improve resiliency. This change is only available for new clusters created with ROSA CLI 1.2.7 or later. There are no supported migration paths for existing OIDC provider configurations.

[id="rosa-known-issues_{context}"]
== Known issues
* The OpenShift Cluster Manager roles (`ocm-role`) and user roles (`user-role`) that are key to the ROSA provisioning wizard might get enabled accidentally in your Red Hat organization by another user. However, this behavior does not affect the usability.
* The `htpasswd` identity provider does not function as expected in all scenarios against the `rosa create admin` function.

[id="rosa-deprecated-removed-features_{context}"]
== Deprecated and removed features
Some features available in previous releases have been deprecated or removed. Deprecated functionality is still included in ROSA and continues to be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of this product and is not recommended for new deployments.

* **ROSA non-STS deployment mode:** ROSA non-STS deployment mode is no longer the preferred method for new clusters. Instead, users must deploy ROSA with the STS mode. This deprecation is in line with our new ROSA provisioning wizard UI experience at https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/rosa/wizard.

* **Label removal on core namespaces:** ROSA is no longer labeling OpenShift core using the `name` label. Customers should migrate to referencing the `kubernetes.io/metadata.name` label if needed for Network Policies or other use cases.
