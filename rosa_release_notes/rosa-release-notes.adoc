* **Configure machine pool disk volume for {hcp-title} clusters.** You can now configure the disk volume size for machine pools in {hcp-title} clusters. The default disk size is 300 GiB, and you can configure it from a minimum of 75 GiB to a maximum of 16,384 GiB. For more information, see xref:../rosa_cluster_admin/rosa_nodes/rosa-managing-worker-nodes.adoc#configuring-machine-pool-disk-volume_rosa-managing-worker-nodes[Configuring machine pool disk volume].

[id="rosa-q3-2024_{context}"]
=== Q3 2024

* **{hcp-title} multi-architecture cluster update.** {hcp-title-first} clusters created before 25 July, 2024 will migrate to a multi-architecture image on their next upgrade allowing you to use {AWS} Arm-based Graviton instance types for your workloads. For more information, see xref:../upgrading/rosa-hcp-upgrading.adoc#rosa-upgrade-options_rosa-hcp-upgrading[Upgrading ROSA with HCP clusters].

* **{hcp-title} cluster node limit update.** {hcp-title} clusters can now scale to 500 worker nodes. This is an increase from the previous limit of 250 nodes. For more information, see xref:../rosa_planning/rosa-hcp-limits-scalability.adoc#tested-cluster-maximums-hcp-sd_rosa-hcp-limits-scalability[ROSA with HCP limits and scalability].

* **IMDSv2 support in {hcp-title}.** You can now enforce the use of the IMDSv2 endpoint for default machine pool worker nodes on new {hcp-title} clusters and for new machine pools on existing clusters. For more information, see xref:../rosa_hcp/terraform/rosa-hcp-creating-a-cluster-quickly-terraform.adoc#rosa-hcp-creating-a-cluster-quickly-terraform[Creating a default ROSA cluster using Terraform].

* **Upgrade multiple nodes simultaneously.** You can now configure a machine pool to upgrade multiple nodes simultaneously. Two new machine pool parameters, `max-surge` and `max-unavailable`, give you greater control over how machine pool upgrades occur. For more information, see xref:../upgrading/rosa-hcp-upgrading.adoc#rosa-hcp-upgrading[Upgrading ROSA with HCP clusters].

* **{hcp-title} Graviton Arm-based instance types.** You can now use {AWS} Arm-based Graviton instance types for your workloads in {hcp-title-first} clusters created after 24 July, 2024. For more information, see xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-hcp-instance-types.adoc#rosa-sdpolicy-aws-instance-types-graviton_rosa-hcp-instance-types[AWS Graviton Arm-based instance types].

* **ROSA CLI update.** The ROSA CLI (`rosa`) was updated to a new version. For information about what has changed in this release, see the link:https://github.com/openshift/rosa/releases/tag/v1.2.42[ROSA CLI release notes]. For more information about the ROSA CLI (`rosa`), see xref:../cli_reference/rosa_cli/rosa-get-started-cli.adoc#rosa-about_rosa-getting-started-cli[About the ROSA CLI].

[id="rosa-q2-2024_{context}"]
=== Q2 2024

* **Approve additional principals for {hcp-title} clusters.** You can approve additional user-roles to connect to your cluster's private API server endpoint. For more information, see xref:../rosa_hcp/rosa-hcp-aws-private-creating-cluster.adoc#rosa-additional-principals-overview_rosa-hcp-aws-private-creating-cluster[Additional principals on your {hcp-title} cluster].

* **ROSA CLI update.** The ROSA CLI (`rosa`) was updated to a new version. For information about what has changed in this release, see the link:https://github.com/openshift/rosa/releases/tag/v1.2.41[ROSA CLI release notes]. For more information about the ROSA CLI (`rosa`), see xref:../cli_reference/rosa_cli/rosa-get-started-cli.adoc#rosa-about_rosa-getting-started-cli[About the ROSA CLI].

* **Approved Access for ROSA clusters.** Red{nbsp}Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) managing and proactively supporting ROSA Clusters will typically not require elevated access to customer clusters as part of the normal operations. In the unlikely event should Red{nbsp}Hat SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) need elevated access, the _Approved Access_ functionality provides an interface for customers to review and _approve_ or _deny_ access requests.
+
Elevated access requests to ROSA clusters and the corresponding cloud accounts can be created by Red{nbsp}Hat SRE either in response to a customer-initiated support ticket or in response to alerts received by a Red{nbsp}Hat SRE, as part of the standard incident response process. For more information, see xref:../support/approved-access.adoc#approved-access[Approved Access]. This is applicable to ROSA and Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (classic architecture).

* **ROSA command enhancement.** The `rosa describe` command has a new optional argument, `--get-role-policy-bindings`. This new argument allows users to view the policies attached to STS roles assigned to the selected cluster. For more information, see xref:../cli_reference/rosa_cli/rosa-manage-objects-cli.adoc#rosa-describe-cluster_rosa-managing-objects-cli[describe cluster].

* **Expanded customer-managed policy capabilities.** You can now attach customer-managed policies to the IAM roles required to run both ROSA (classic architecture) and ROSA clusters. Furthermore, these customer-managed policies, including the permissions attached to those policies, are not modified during cluster or role upgrades. For more information, see xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa-sts-about-iam-resources.adoc#rosa-aws-customer-managed-policies_rosa-sts-about-iam-resources[Customer-managed policies].

* **Permission boundaries for the installer role policy.** You can apply a policy as a _permissions boundary_ on the ROSA installer role. The combination of policy and boundary policy limits the maximum permissions for the Amazon Web Services(AWS) Identity and Access Management (IAM) entity role. ROSA includes a set of three prepared permission boundary policy files, with which you can restrict permissions for the installer role since changing the installer policy itself is not supported. For more information, see xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa-sts-about-iam-resources.adoc#rosa-sts-aws-requirements-attaching-boundary-policy_rosa-sts-about-iam-resources[Permission boundaries for the installer role]. This is applicable only to Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (classic architecture).

* **Cluster delete protection.** You can now enable the cluster delete protection option, which helps to prevent you from accidentally deleting a cluster. For more information on using the cluster delete protection option with the ROSA CLI, see xref:../cli_reference/rosa_cli/rosa-manage-objects-cli.adoc#rosa-edit-cluster_rosa-managing-objects-cli[edit cluster]. For more information on using the cluster delete protection option in the UI, see xref:../rosa_install_access_delete_clusters/rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-quickly.adoc#rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-using-defaults-ocm_rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-quickly[Creating a cluster with the default options using OpenShift Cluster Manager].

=== Q1 2023

* **OIDC provider endpoint URL update.** Starting with ROSA CLI version 1.2.7, all new cluster OIDC provider endpoint URLs are no longer regional. Amazon CloudFront is part of this implementation to improve access speed, reduce latency, and improve resiliency. This change is only available for new clusters created with ROSA CLI 1.2.7 or later. There are no supported migration paths for existing OIDC provider configurations.

[id="rosa-known-issues_{context}"]
== Known issues
* If you configure your cluster using external OIDC configuration and set the `--user-auth` flag to `disabled`, the console pods might enter a crash loop. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29510[*OCPBUGS-29510*])
* The OpenShift Cluster Manager roles (`ocm-role`) and user roles (`user-role`) that are key to the ROSA provisioning wizard might get enabled accidentally in your Red{nbsp}Hat organization by another user. However, this behavior does not affect the usability.
* The `htpasswd` identity provider does not function as expected in all scenarios against the `rosa create admin` function.

include::modules/rosa-update-cli-tool.adoc[]

[id="rosa-deprecated-removed-features_{context}"]
== Deprecated and removed features
Some features available in previous releases have been deprecated or removed. Deprecated functionality is still included in ROSA and continues to be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of this product and is not recommended for new deployments.

* **ROSA non-STS deployment mode.** ROSA non-STS deployment mode is no longer the preferred method for new clusters. Instead, users must deploy ROSA with the STS mode. This deprecation is in line with our new ROSA provisioning wizard UI experience at https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/rosa/wizard.

* **Label removal on core namespaces.** ROSA is no longer labeling OpenShift core using the `name` label. Customers should migrate to referencing the `kubernetes.io/metadata.name` label if needed for Network Policies or other use cases.
