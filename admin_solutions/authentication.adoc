[[basic-auth-remote]]
== Basic Authentication (Remote)

[[BasicAuthPasswordIdentityProvider]]

Basic Authentication is a generic backend integration mechanism that allows
users to log in to {product-title} with credentials validated against a remote
identity provider.

[CAUTION]
====
Basic Authentication must use an HTTPS connection to the remote server in order
to prevent potential snooping of the user ID and password, and to prevent
man-in-the-middle attacks.
====

With `*BasicAuthPasswordIdentityProvider*` configured, users send their username
and password to {product-title}, which then validates those credentials against
a remote server by making a server-to-server request, passing the credentials as
a Basic Auth header. This requires users to send their credentials to
{product-title} during login. 

[NOTE]
====
This only works for username/password login mechanisms, and {product-title} must
be able to make network requests to the remote authentication server. 
====

[[configuring-basic-auth-on-master]]
=== Configuring Authentication on the Master

. If you have:
+
- Already completed the installation of Openshift, then copy the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file into a new directory; for example:
+
----
$ mkdir basicauthconfig; cp master-config.yaml basicauthconfig
----
+
- Not yet installed {product-title}, then start the {product-title} API server,
specifying the hostname of the (future) {product-title} master and a directory
to store the configuration file created by the start command:
+
----
$ openshift start master --public-master=<apiserver> --write-config=<directory>
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ openshift start master --public-master=https://myapiserver.com:8443 --write-config=basicauthconfig
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are installing with Ansible, then you must add the
`*identityProvider*` configuration to the Ansible playbook.
If you use the following steps to modify your configuration manually after installing with Ansible, then you will lose any modifications whenever you re-run the install tool or upgrade.
====
+
. Edit the new *_master-config.yaml_* file's `*identityProviders*` stanza.
. Copy
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#basic-auth-example-config[the example `*BasicAuthPasswordIdentityProvider*` configuration] and paste it to replace the existing stanza.
. Make the following modifications to the `*identityProviders*` stanza:
.. Set the provider `*name*` to something unique and relevant to your
deployment. This name is prefixed to the returned user ID to form an identity
name.
.. If required,
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#mapping-identities-to-users[set `*mappingMethod*`] to control how mappings are established between the
provider's identities and user objects.
.. Specify the HTTPS `*url*` to use to connect to a server that accepts credentials in Basic authentication headers.
.. Optionally, set the `*ca*` to the certificate bundle to use in order to validate server certificates for the configured URL, or leave it empty to use the system-trusted roots.
.. Optionally, remove or set the `*certFile*` to the client certificate to present when making requests to the configured URL.
.. If `*certFile*` is specified, then you must set the `*keyFile*` to the key for the client certificate.
. Save your changes and close the file.
. Start the {product-title} API server, specifying the configuration file you just
modified:
+
----
$ openshift start master --config=<path/to/modified/config>/master-config.yaml
----

Once configured, any user logging in to the {product-title} web console will be
prompted to log in using their Basic authentication credentials.

[[basic-troubleshooting]]
=== Troubleshooting

The most common issue relates to network connectivity to the backend server. For
simple debugging, run `curl` commands on the master. To test for a successful
login, replace the `<user>` and `<password>` in the following example command
with valid credentials. To test an invalid login, replace them with false
credentials.

----
curl --cacert /path/to/ca.crt --cert /path/to/client.crt --key /path/to/client.key -u <user>:<password> -v https://www.example.com/remote-idp
----

*Successful responses*

A `200` status with a `sub` (subject) key indicates success:

----
{"sub":"userid"}
----
The subject must be unique to the authenticated user, and must not be able to
be modified.

A successful response may optionally provide additional data, such as:

* A display name using the `name` key:
+
----
{"sub":"userid", "name": "User Name", ...}
----
* An email address using the `email` key:
+
----
{"sub":"userid", "email":"user@example.com", ...}
----
* A preferred user name using the `preferred_username` key: 
+
----
{"sub":"014fbff9a07c", "preferred_username":"bob", ...}
----
+
The `preferred_username` key is useful when
the unique, unchangeable subject is a database key or UID, and a more
human-readable name exists. This is used as a hint when provisioning the
{product-title} user for the authenticated identity.

*Failed responses*

- A `401` response indicates failed authentication.
- A non-`200` status or the presence of a non-empty "error" key indicates an
error: `{"error":"Error message"}`

Once one or more users have logged in, you can run `oc get users` to view a
list of users and verify that users were created successfully.

xref:../admin_solutions/user_role_mgmt.adoc#control-user-roles[control user roles].


[[request-header-auth]]
== Request Header Authentication

Configuring Request Header authentication allows users to log in to
{product-title} using request header values, such as `X-Remote-User`. It is
typically used in combination with an authenticating proxy, which authenticates
the user and then provides {product-title} with the user's identity via a
request header value. This is similar to how
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/OpenShift_Enterprise/2/html/Deployment_Guide/Configuring_OpenShift_Enterprise_Authentication.html[the remote user plug-in in OpenShift Enterprise 2] 
allowed administrators to provide Kerberos, LDAP, and many other forms of
enterprise authentication. The benefit of this configuration is that user
credentials can be handled by the proxy and never seen by OpenShift.

The proxy must be able to make network requests to the {product-title} server.
Unauthenticated login attempts are redirected to a configured proxy URL. The
proxy can authenticate browser clients regardless of how it is configured, but
it must (currently) use either Basic Auth or Kerberos in order to work with the
`oc` CLI tooling.

For users to authenticate using this identity provider, they must access
_\https://<master>/oauth/authorize_ via an authenticating proxy. You can configure
the OAuth server to redirect unauthenticated requests to the proxy.

[[configuring-request-header-auth-on-master]]
=== Configuring Authentication on the Master

. If you have:
+
- Already completed the installation of Openshift, then copy the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file into a new directory; for example:
+
----
$ mkdir reqheadauthconfig; cp master-config.yaml reqheadauthconfig
----
+
- Not yet installed {product-title}, then start the {product-title} API server,
specifying the hostname of the (future) {product-title} master and a directory
to store the configuration file created by the start command:
+
----
$ openshift start master --public-master=<apiserver> --write-config=<directory>
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ openshift start master --public-master=https://myapiserver.com:8443 --write-config=reqheadauthconfig
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are installing with Ansible, then you must add the
`*identityProvider*` configuration to the Ansible playbook.
If you use the following steps to modify your configuration manually after installing with Ansible, then you will lose any modifications whenever you re-run the install tool or upgrade.
====
+
. Edit the new *_master-config.yaml_* file's `*identityProviders*` stanza.
. View
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#reqhead-auth-example-config[the example `*RequestHeaderIdentityProvider*` configuration] 
and use it as a guide to replace the existing stanza.
. Modify the `*identityProviders*` stanza based on which headers you plan to
pass in.
.. Set the provider `*name*` to something unique and relevant to your
deployment. This name is prefixed to the returned user ID to form an identity
name.
.. If required,
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#mapping-identities-to-users[set `*mappingMethod*`] 
to control how mappings are established between the provider's identities and
user objects.
.. Set the `*challenge*` parameter to *true* to redirect unauthenticated
requests from clients expecting `WWW-Authenticate` challenges. 
.. Set the `*provider.challengeURL*` parameter to the proxy URL to which to send
clients expecting `WWW-Authenticate` challenges, like the `oc` CLI client.
This parameter can include the 
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#RequestHeaderIDP-urlquerytokens[`${url}` and `${query}` tokens]
in the query portion of the URL. 
.. Set the `*login*` parameter to *true* to redirect unauthenticated requests
from clients expecting login flows. 
.. Set the `*provider.loginURL*` parameter to the proxy URL to which to send
clients expecting login flows, like web browser clients. This parameter can include the 
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#RequestHeaderIDP-urlquerytokens[`${url}` and `${query}` tokens]
in the query portion of the URL. 
.. Set the `*clientCA*` parameter to the certificate bundle to use to check
incoming requests for a valid client certificate before the request's headers
are checked for a user name. 
+
[WARNING]
====
If you expect unauthenticated requests to reach the OAuth server, a `*clientCA*`
parameter (and optionally, `*clientCommonNames*`) should be set for this
identity provider. Otherwise, any direct request to the OAuth server can
impersonate any identity from this provider, merely by setting a request header.
====
.. Optionally, set the `*clientCommonNames*` parameter to a list of Common Names
(`cn`). If set, a valid client certificate with a Common Name (`cn`) in the
specified list must be presented before the request headers are checked for user
names. If empty, then any Common Name is allowed. This must be used in
combination with `*clientCA*`.
.. Set the `*headers*` parameter to the header names to check, in order, for the
user identity. The first header containing a value is used as the identity. This
parameter is required and is case-insensitive.
.. Optionally, set the `*emailHeaders*` parameter to the header names to check,
in order, for an email address. The first header containing a value is used as
the email address. This parameter is case-insensitive.
.. Optionally, set the `*nameHeaders*` parameter to the header names to check,
in order, for a display name. The first header containing a value is used as the
display name. This parameter is case-insensitive.
.. Optionally, set the `*preferredUsernameHeaders*` parameter to the header
names to check, in order, for a preferred user name (if different than the
immutable identity determined from the headers specified in `*headers*`). The
first header containing a value is used as the preferred user name when
provisioning. This parameter is case-insensitive.
. Save your changes and close the file.
. Start the {product-title} API server, specifying the configuration file you just modified:
+
----
$ openshift start master --config=<path/to/modified/config>/master-config.yaml
----

Once configured, any user logging in to the {product-title} web console will be
redirected to the authenticating proxy, which will authenticate the user.

[[create-users-request-header-auth]]
=== Creating Users with Request Header Authentication

You do not create users in {product-title} when integrating with an external
authentication provider, such as the system that the proxy server is using as an
authentication server. That server is the system of record, meaning that users
are defined there, and any user with a valid user name for the configured
authentication server can log in.

To add a user to {product-title}, the user must exist on the system the proxy is
using as an authentication server, and if required you must add the users to
that system. 

[[view-users-request-header-auth]]

[[keystone-auth]]
== Keystone Authentication

http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/[Keystone] is an OpenStack project
that provides identity, token, catalog, and policy services. You can integrate
your {product-title} cluster with Keystone to enable shared authentication with
an OpenStack Keystone v3 server configured to store users in an internal
database. Once configured, this configuration allows users to log in to
{product-title} with their Keystone credentials.

This name is prefixed to provider user names to form an identity name.
.. If required,
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#mapping-identities-to-users[change `*mappingMethod*`] to control how mappings are established between the
provider's identities and user objects.
.. Change the `*domainName*` to the domain name of your OpenStack Keystone server. In Keystone, usernames are domain-specific. Only a single domain is supported.
.. Specify the `*url*` to use to connect to your OpenStack Keystone server.
.. Optionally, change the `*ca*` to the certificate bundle to use in order to validate server certificates for the configured URL.
.. Optionally, change the `*certFile*` to the client certificate to present when making requests to the configured URL.

[[ldap-auth]]
== LDAP Authentication

LDAP uses bind operations to authenticate applications, and you can integrate your {product-title} cluster to use LDAPv3 authentication.
Configuring LDAP authentication allows users to log in to {product-title} with their LDAP credentials.

include::install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc[tag=ldapblurb]

[WARNING]
====
The basic authentication configuration covered by this topic is not enough to
create a secure LDAP authentication solution for {product-title}. It has a
single point of failure, meaning that if the single LDAP authentication server
became unavailable then all {product-title} operations requiring authentication
would also be unavailable.

Additionally, this basic configuration has no access control of its own; all
LDAP users matching the configured filter are able to log into {product-title}.

With the
xref:../install_config/advanced_ldap_configuration/sssd_for_ldap_failover.adoc#setting-up-for-ldap-failover[SSSD failover setup],
FreeIPA and Active Directory can also set rules to specifically restrict which
users can and cannot access {product-title}.

The following three advanced topics begin where this basic LDAP authentication
topic ends, and describe the setup for a fault-tolerant authentication system:

. Copy
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#ldap-example-config[the example `*LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider*` configuration]
and paste it to replace the existing stanza.
. Make the following modifications to the `*identityProviders*` stanza:
.. Change the provider `*name*` ("my_ldap_provider") to something unique and
relevant to your deployment. This name is prefixed to the returned user name to
form an identity name.
.. If required,
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#mapping-identities-to-users[change `*mappingMethod*`] to control how mappings are established between the
provider's identities and user objects.
.. Change `*id*` to the attribute to use as the identity, which must be unique
and immutable within the identity provider. This option can accept multiple
attributes. If more than one is specified, they will be checked in order and the
first non-empty attribute will be used. At least one attribute is required. If
none of the listed attribute have a value, then authentication fails.
.. Change `*email*` to the attribute to use as the email address.  This option
can accept multiple attributes. If more than one is specified, they will be
checked in order and the first non-empty attribute will be used.
.. Change `*name*` to the attribute to use as the display name.  This option can
accept multiple attributes. If more than one is specified, they will be checked
in order and the first non-empty attribute will be used.
.. Optionally, change `*preferredUsername*` to the attribute to use as the
preferred {product-title} username when provisioning a user for this identity.
If unspecified, the `*id*` attribute is used as the preferred username. This
option can accept multiple attributes. If more than one is specified, they will
be checked in order and the first non-empty attribute will be used.
+
The attribute you select as the `*preferredUsername*` should still be unique,
even within the identity provider.  The `*preferredUsername*` attribute is only
used when provisioning the user for the initial login. Afterward, the existing
{product-title} user is looked up by their identity provider ID, in case the
`*preferredUsername*` attribute changes.
+
Using `*preferredUsername*` is helpful when the immutable `*id*` attribute is
not a human-recognizable value, and there is another attribute with a value that
is more recognizable to the user. For example, if the `*id*` is something like
"e43adf8cc243", you could set `*preferredUsername*` to `login`, which could have
potentially muteable values, such as "bobsmith".
.. Change the `*ca*` to the certificate bundle to use in order to validate
server certificates for the configured URL. If empty, system trusted roots are
used. This setting only applies if *insecure: false*. If the LDAP server
requires a different certificate chain, this attribute should contain the
filesystem path of that certificate or certificate bundle.
.. If required, modify the `*insecure*` parameter. The default is *false*, and this must be *false* when using `ldaps://` URLs. When *false*, `ldaps://` URLs connect using TLS, and `ldap://` URLs are upgraded to TLS. When *true*, no TLS connection is made to the server, however, setting this to *true* creates an invalid configuration for LDAP.
.. Define an RFC 2255 URL that
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#ldap-url[specifies the LDAP host and search parameters] to use.
. Save your changes and close the file.
. Start the {product-title} API server, specifying the configuration file you just
modified:
+
----
$ openshift start master --master-config=<path/to/modified/config>/master-config.yaml
----

Once configured, any user logging in to the {product-title} web console will be
prompted to log in using their LDAP credentials.


[[create-users-ldap-auth]]

[[github-auth]]
== GitHub Authentication

GitHub uses OAuth, and you can integrate your {product-title} cluster to use
that OAuth authentication. OAuth basically facilitates a token exchange flow.

Configuring GitHub authentication allows users to log in to {product-title} with
their GitHub credentials. To prevent anyone with any GitHub user ID from logging
in to your {product-title} cluster, you can restrict access to only those in
specific GitHub organizations.

[[register-app-on-github]]
=== Registering the Application on GitHub

. On GitHub, click https://github.com/settings/profile[Settings] ->
https://github.com/settings/applications[OAuth applications] ->
https://github.com/settings/developers[Developer applications] ->
https://github.com/settings/applications/new[Register an application]
to navigate to the page for a
https://github.com/settings/applications/new[new OAuth application].
. Type an application name. For example: `My OpenShift Install`
. Type a homepage URL. For example: `https://myapiserver.com:8443`
. Optionally, type an application description.
. Type the authorization callback URL, where the end of the URL contains the
identity provider *name* (defined in the `*identityProviders*` stanza of the xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#install-config-master-node-configuration[*_master configuration file_*], which you configure in the next section of this topic):

<apiserver>/oauth2callback/<identityProviderName>
----
+
For example:
+
----
https://myapiserver.com:8443/oauth2callback/github/
----
. Click *Register application*. GitHub provides a Client ID and a Client Secret.
Keep this window open so you can copy these values and paste them into the
master configuration file.

[NOTE]
====
Using `openshift start master` on its own would auto-detect host names, but
GitHub must be able to redirect to the exact host name that you specified when
registering the application. For this reason, you cannot auto-detect the ID
because it might redirect to the wrong address. Instead, you must specify the
hostname that web browsers use to interact with your {product-title} cluster.

xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#GitHub[the example `*GitHubIdentityProvider*` configuration]
and paste it to replace the existing stanza.
. Make the following modifications to the `*identityProviders*` stanza:
.. Change the provider `*name*` to match the callback URL you configured on
GitHub.
+
For example, if you defined the callback URL as
`https://myapiserver.com:8443/oauth2callback/github/` then the `*name*` must be
`github`.
.. Change `*clientID*` to the Client ID from GitHub that you

.. Change `*organizations*` to include a list of one or more GitHub
organizations to which a user must have membership in order to authenticate. If
specified, only GitHub users that are members of at least one of the listed
organizations will be allowed to log in. If this is not specified, then any
person with a valid GitHub account can log in.
. Save your changes and close the file.
. Start the {product-title} API server, specifying the configuration file you just
modified:
+
----
$ openshift start master --config=<path/to/modified/config>/master-config.yaml
----

Once configured, any user logging in to the {product-title} web console will be
prompted to log in using their GitHub credentials. On their first login, the
user must click *authorize application* to permit GitHub to use their username,
password, and organization membership with {product-title}. The user is then
redirected back to the web console.

=== Creating Users with GitHub Authentication

You do not create users in {product-title} when integrating with an external
authentication provider, such as, in this case, GitHub. GitHub is the system of
record, meaning that users are defined by GitHub, and any user belonging to a
specified organization can log in.

To add a user to {product-title}, you must add that user to an approved
organization on GitHub, and if required create a new GitHub account for the
user.

=== Verifying Users

Once one or more users have logged in, you can run `oc get users` to view a
list of users and verify that users were created successfully:

.Output of `oc get users` command
====

----
$ oc get users
NAME         UID                                    FULL NAME   IDENTITIES
bobsmith     433b5641-066f-11e6-a6d8-acfc32c1ca87   Bob Smith   github:873654 <1>
----
<1> Identities in {product-title} are comprised of the identity provider name and GitHub's internal numeric user ID. This way, if a user changes their GitHub username or e-mail they can still log in to {product-title} instead of relying on the credentials attached to the GitHub account. This creates a stable login.
