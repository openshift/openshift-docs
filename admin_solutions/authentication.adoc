[[keystone-auth]]
== Keystone Authentication

http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/[Keystone] is an OpenStack project
that provides identity, token, catalog, and policy services. You can integrate
your {product-title} cluster with Keystone to enable shared authentication with
an OpenStack Keystone v3 server configured to store users in an internal
database. Once configured, this configuration allows users to log in to
{product-title} with their Keystone credentials.

[[config-keystone-auth-on-master]]
=== Configuring Authentication on the Master

. If you have:
.. Already completed the installation of Openshift, then copy the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file into a new directory; for example:
+
----
$ cd /etc/origin/master
$ mkdir keystoneconfig; cp master-config.yaml keystoneconfig
----
.. Not yet installed {product-title}, then start the {product-title} API server,
specifying the hostname of the (future) {product-title} master and a directory
to store the configuration file created by the start command:
+
----
$ openshift start master --public-master=<apiserver> --write-config=<directory>
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ openshift start master --public-master=https://myapiserver.com:8443 --write-config=keystoneconfig
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are installing with Ansible, then you must add the
`*identityProvider*` configuration to the Ansible playbook.
If you use the following steps to modify your configuration manually after installing with Ansible, then you will lose any modifications whenever you re-run the install tool or upgrade.
====
+
. Edit the new *_keystoneconfig/master-config.yaml_* file's `*identityProviders*` stanza.
. Copy
link:../install_config/configuring_authentication.html#KeystonePasswordIdentityProvider[the example `*KeystonePasswordIdentityProvider*` configuration]
and paste it to replace the existing stanza.
. Make the following modifications to the `*identityProviders*` stanza:
.. Change the provider `*name*` ("my_keystone_provider") to match your Keystone server.
This name is prefixed to provider user names to form an identity name.
.. If required,
link:../install_config/configuring_authentication.html#mapping-identities-to-users[change `*mappingMethod*`] to control how mappings are established between the
provider's identities and user objects.
.. Change the `*domainName*` to the domain name of your OpenStack Keystone server. In Keystone, usernames are domain-specific. Only a single domain is supported.
.. Specify the `*url*` to use to connect to your OpenStack Keystone server.
.. Optionally, change the `*ca*` to the certificate bundle to use in order to validate server certificates for the configured URL.
.. Optionally, change the `*certFile*` to the client certificate to present when making requests to the configured URL.
.. If `*certFile*` is specified, then you must change the `*keyFile*` to the key for the client certificate.
. Save your changes and close the file.
. Start the {product-title} API server, specifying the configuration file you just
modified:
+
----
$ openshift start master --config=<path/to/modified/config>/master-config.yaml
----

Once configured, any user logging in to the {product-title} web console will be
prompted to log in using their Keystone credentials.

[[create-users-keystone-auth]]
=== Creating Users with Keystone Authentication

You do not create users in {product-title} when integrating with an external
authentication provider, such as, in this case, Keystone. Keystone is the system of record, meaning that users are defined in a Keystone database, and any user with a valid Keystone user name for the configured authentication server can log in.

To add a user to {product-title}, the user must exist in the Keystone database, and if required you must create a new Keystone account for the user.

[[view-users-keystone-auth]]
=== Viewing Users

Once one or more users have logged in, you can run `oc get users` to view a
list of users and verify that users were created successfully:

.Output of `oc get users` command
====

----
$ oc get users
NAME         UID                                    FULL NAME   IDENTITIES
bobsmith     a0c1d95c-1cb5-11e6-a04a-002186a28631   Bob Smith   keystone:bobsmith <1>
----
<1> Identities in {product-title} are comprised of the identity provider name prefixed to the Keystone username.

[[ldap-auth]]
== LDAP Authentication

LDAP uses bind operations to authenticate applications, and you can integrate your {product-title} cluster to use LDAPv3 authentication.
Configuring LDAP authentication allows users to log in to {product-title} with their LDAP credentials.

include::install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc[tag=ldapblurb]

[WARNING]
====
The basic authentication configuration covered by this topic is not enough to
create a secure LDAP authentication solution for {product-title}. It has a
single point of failure, meaning that if the single LDAP authentication server
became unavailable then all {product-title} operations requiring authentication
would also be unavailable.

Additionally, this basic configuration has no access control of its own; all
LDAP users matching the configured filter are able to log into {product-title}.

With the
xref:../install_config/advanced_ldap_configuration/sssd_for_ldap_failover.adoc#[SSSD failover setup],
FreeIPA and Active Directory can also set rules to specifically restrict which
users can and cannot access {product-title}.

The following three advanced topics begin where this basic LDAP authentication
topic ends, and describe the setup for a fault-tolerant authentication system:

. xref:../install_config/advanced_ldap_configuration/sssd_for_ldap_failover.adoc#[Setting up SSSD for LDAP Failover]
. xref:../install_config/advanced_ldap_configuration/configuring_form_based_authentication.adoc#[Configuring Form-Based Authentication]
. xref:../install_config/advanced_ldap_configuration/configuring_extended_ldap_attributes.adoc#[Configuring Extended LDAP Attributes]
====

[[config-ldap-auth-on-master]]
=== Configuring Authentication on the Master

. If you have:
.. Already completed the installation of Openshift, then copy the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file into a new directory; for example:
+
----
$ cd /etc/origin/master
$ mkdir ldapconfig; cp master-config.yaml ldapconfig
----
.. Not yet installed {product-title}, then start the {product-title} API server,
specifying the hostname of the (future) {product-title} master and a directory
to store the configuration file created by the start command:
+
----
$ openshift start master --public-master=<apiserver> --write-config=<directory>
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ openshift start master --public-master=https://myapiserver.com:8443 --write-config=ldapconfig
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are installing with Ansible, then you must add the
`*identityProvider*` configuration to the Ansible playbook.
If you use the following steps to modify your configuration manually after installing with Ansible, then you will lose any modifications whenever you re-run the install tool or upgrade.
====
+
. Edit the new *_master-config.yaml_* file's `*identityProviders*` stanza.
. Copy
link:../install_config/configuring_authentication.html#ldap-example-config[the example `*LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider*` configuration]
and paste it to replace the existing stanza.
. Make the following modifications to the `*identityProviders*` stanza:
.. Change the provider `*name*` ("my_ldap_provider") to something unique and
relevant to your deployment. This name is prefixed to the returned user name to
form an identity name.
.. If required,
link:../install_config/configuring_authentication.html#mapping-identities-to-users[change `*mappingMethod*`] to control how mappings are established between the
provider's identities and user objects.
.. Change `*id*` to the attribute to use as the identity, which must be unique
and immutable within the identity provider. This option can accept multiple
attributes. If more than one is specified, they will be checked in order and the
first non-empty attribute will be used. At least one attribute is required. If
none of the listed attribute have a value, then authentication fails.
.. Change `*email*` to the attribute to use as the email address.  This option
can accept multiple attributes. If more than one is specified, they will be
checked in order and the first non-empty attribute will be used.
.. Change `*name*` to the attribute to use as the display name.  This option can
accept multiple attributes. If more than one is specified, they will be checked
in order and the first non-empty attribute will be used.
.. Optionally, change `*preferredUsername*` to the attribute to use as the
preferred {product-title} username when provisioning a user for this identity.
If unspecified, the `*id*` attribute is used as the preferred username. This
option can accept multiple attributes. If more than one is specified, they will
be checked in order and the first non-empty attribute will be used.
+
The attribute you select as the `*preferredUsername*` should still be unique,
even within the identity provider.  The `*preferredUsername*` attribute is only
used when provisioning the user for the initial login. Afterward, the existing
{product-title} user is looked up by their identity provider ID, in case the
`*preferredUsername*` attribute changes.
+
Using `*preferredUsername*` is helpful when the immutable `*id*` attribute is
not a human-recognizable value, and there is another attribute with a value that
is more recognizable to the user. For example, if the `*id*` is something like
"e43adf8cc243", you could set `*preferredUsername*` to `login`, which could have
potentially muteable values, such as "bobsmith".
.. Change the `*ca*` to the certificate bundle to use in order to validate
server certificates for the configured URL. If empty, system trusted roots are
used. This setting only applies if *insecure: false*. If the LDAP server
requires a different certificate chain, this attribute should contain the
filesystem path of that certificate or certificate bundle.
.. If required, modify the `*insecure*` parameter. The default is *false*, and this must be *false* when using `ldaps://` URLs. When *false*, `ldaps://` URLs connect using TLS, and `ldap://` URLs are upgraded to TLS. When *true*, no TLS connection is made to the server, however, setting this to *true* creates an invalid configuration for LDAP.
.. Define an RFC 2255 URL that
link:../install_config/configuring_authentication.html#ldap-url[specifies the LDAP host and search parameters] to use.
. Save your changes and close the file.
. Start the {product-title} API server, specifying the configuration file you just
modified:
+
----
$ openshift start master --master-config=<path/to/modified/config>/master-config.yaml
----

Once configured, any user logging in to the {product-title} web console will be
prompted to log in using their LDAP credentials.

[[github-auth]]
== GitHub Authentication

GitHub uses OAuth, and you can integrate your {product-title} cluster to use
that OAuth authentication. OAuth basically facilitates a token exchange flow.

Configuring GitHub authentication allows users to log in to {product-title} with
their GitHub credentials. To prevent anyone with any GitHub user ID from logging
in to your {product-title} cluster, you can restrict access to only those in
specific GitHub organizations.

[[register-app-on-github]]
=== Registering the Application on GitHub

. On GitHub, click https://github.com/settings/profile[Settings] ->
https://github.com/settings/applications[OAuth applications] ->
https://github.com/settings/developers[Developer applications] ->
https://github.com/settings/applications/new[Register an application]
to navigate to the page for a
https://github.com/settings/applications/new[new OAuth application].
. Type an application name. For example: `My OpenShift Install`
. Type a homepage URL. For example: `https://myapiserver.com:8443`
. Optionally, type an application description.
. Type the authorization callback URL, where the end of the URL contains the
identity provider *name* (defined in the `*identityProviders*` stanza of the xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#install-config-master-node-configuration[*_master configuration file_*], which you configure in the next section of this topic):
+
----
<apiserver>/oauth2callback/<identityProviderName>
----
+
For example:
+
----
https://myapiserver.com:8443/oauth2callback/github/
----
. Click *Register application*. GitHub provides a Client ID and a Client Secret.
Keep this window open so you can copy these values and paste them into the
master configuration file.

[[config-github-auth-on-master]]
=== Configuring Authentication on the Master

. If you have:
.. Already completed the installation of Openshift, then copy the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file into a new directory; for example:
+
----
$ cd /etc/origin/master
$ mkdir githubconfig; cp master-config.yaml githubconfig
----
.. Not yet installed {product-title}, then start the {product-title} API server,
specifying the hostname of the (future) {product-title} master and a directory
to store the configuration file created by the start command:
+
----
$ openshift start master --public-master=<apiserver> --write-config=<directory>
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ openshift start master --public-master=https://myapiserver.com:8443 --write-config=githubconfig
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are installing with Ansible, then you must add the
`*identityProvider*` configuration to the Ansible playbook.
If you use the following steps to modify your configuration manually after installing with Ansible, then you will lose any modifications whenever you re-run the install tool or upgrade.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
Using `openshift start master` on its own would auto-detect host names, but
GitHub must be able to redirect to the exact host name that you specified when
registering the application. For this reason, you cannot auto-detect the ID
because it might redirect to the wrong address. Instead, you must specify the
hostname that web browsers use to interact with your {product-title} cluster.
====
. Edit the new *_master-config.yaml_* file's `*identityProviders*` stanza.
. Copy
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#GitHub[the example `*GitHubIdentityProvider*` configuration]
and paste it to replace the existing stanza.
. Make the following modifications to the `*identityProviders*` stanza:
.. Change the provider `*name*` to match the callback URL you configured on
GitHub.
+
For example, if you defined the callback URL as
`https://myapiserver.com:8443/oauth2callback/github/` then the `*name*` must be
`github`.
.. Change `*clientID*` to the Client ID from GitHub that you
xref:../admin_solutions/authentication.adoc#register-app-on-github[registered previously].
.. Change `*clientSecret*` to the Client Secret from GitHub that you
xref:../admin_solutions/authentication.adoc#register-app-on-github[registered previously].
.. Change `*organizations*` to include a list of one or more GitHub
organizations to which a user must have membership in order to authenticate. If
specified, only GitHub users that are members of at least one of the listed
organizations will be allowed to log in. If this is not specified, then any
person with a valid GitHub account can log in.
. Save your changes and close the file.
. Start the {product-title} API server, specifying the configuration file you just
modified:
+
----
$ openshift start master --config=<path/to/modified/config>/master-config.yaml
----

Once configured, any user logging in to the {product-title} web console will be
prompted to log in using their GitHub credentials. On their first login, the
user must click *authorize application* to permit GitHub to use their username,
password, and organization membership with {product-title}. The user is then
redirected back to the web console.

[[create-users-github-auth]]
=== Creating Users with GitHub Authentication

You do not create users in {product-title} when integrating with an external
authentication provider, such as, in this case, GitHub. GitHub is the system of
record, meaning that users are defined by GitHub, and any user belonging to a
specified organization can log in.

To add a user to {product-title}, you must add that user to an approved
organization on GitHub, and if required create a new GitHub account for the
user.

[[view-users-github-auth]]
=== Viewing Users

Once one or more users have logged in, you can run `oc get users` to view a
list of users and verify that users were created successfully:

.Output of `oc get users` command

bobsmith     433b5641-066f-11e6-a6d8-acfc32c1ca87   Bob Smith   github:873654 <1>
----
<1> Identities in {product-title} are comprised of the identity provider name and GitHub's internal numeric user ID. This way, if a user changes their GitHub username or e-mail they can still log in to {product-title} instead of relying on the credentials attached to the GitHub account. This creates a stable login.
