=== Setting Limits for Users and Projects

*How can I create limits for users and projects?*

You can place limits within your OpenShift cluster using xref:../admin_guide/quota.adoc#admin-guide-quota[ResourceQuotas]
and
xref:../admin_guide/limits.adoc#admin-guide-limits[LimitRanges].
These quotas and limits allow you to control pod and container limits, object
counts, and compute resources. Currently, these limits and quotas only apply to
projects and not to users. However, you can make a quota-like
xref:../admin_solutions/user_role_mgmt.adoc#limit-number-projects[limit on how many project requests a user can make].

[[setting-limits-users-projects-limit-pods]]

*Creating a quota in a project to limit the number of pods*

To create a quota in the "awesomeproject" that limits the number of pods that
can be created to a maximum of 10:

. Create a *_resource-quota.yaml_* file with the following contents:
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: resource-quota
spec:
  hard:
    pods: "10"
----
+
. Create the quota using the file you just wrote to apply it to the "awesomeproject":
+
[source, bash]
----
$ oc create -f resource-quota.yaml -n awesomeproject
----
+
After the quota has been in effect for a little while, you can view the usage statistics for the hard limit set on pods.
+
. If required, list the quotas defined in the project to see the names of all defined quotas:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ oc get quota -n awesomeproject
NAME                AGE
resource-quota      39m
----

+
. Describe the resource quota for which you want statistics:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ oc describe quota resource-quota -n awesomeproject
Name:			resource-quota
Namespace:		awesomeproject
Resource		Used	Hard
--------		----	----
pods     		3	10
----

+
. Optionally, you can
xref:../admin_guide/quota.adoc#configuring-quota-sync-period[configure the quota synchronization period], which controls how long to wait before restoring quota usage after resources are deleted.
. If you want to remove an active quota to no longer enforce the limits of a project:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ oc delete quota <quota_name>
----

==== Configuration Options

The
xref:setting-limits-users-projects-limit-pods[procedure above]
is just a basic example. The following are references to all the available
options for limits and quotas:

This *_LimitRange_* example explains all the
xref:../admin_guide/limits.adoc#container-limits[container limits] and
xref:../admin_guide/limits.adoc#pod-limits[pod limits] that you can place within
your project:

include::admin_guide/limits.adoc[tag=admin_limits_sample_definitions]

include::admin_guide/limits.adoc[tag=admin_limits_sample_definitions_2]

These *_ResourceQuota_* examples explain all the
xref:../admin_guide/quota.adoc#sample-resource-quota-definitions[Object Counts]
and
xref:../admin_guide/quota.adoc#sample-resource-quota-definitions[Compute Resources] that you can place within your project:

include::admin_guide/quota.adoc[tag=admin_quota_object_counts_1]

include::admin_guide/quota.adoc[tag=admin_quota_object_counts_2]

include::admin_guide/quota.adoc[tag=admin_quota_compute_resources]


[[limit-number-projects]]
=== Limiting the Number of Projects a User Can Have

You can
xref:../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#limit-projects-per-user[limit the number of projects] that a user may request by categorizing users with label selectors with the `oc label` command. A label selector consists of the label name and the label value:

----
label=value
----

Once users are labeled, you must
xref:../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#modifying-the-template-for-new-projects[modify the default project template] in the *_master-config.yaml_* file
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/admission_controllers.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-admission-controllers[using an admission control plug-in]. This allows some users to create more projects than others, and you can define different values (or levels) for each label.

*Limiting how many projects a user can request by defining three different privilege levels*

The label is named `level`, and the possible values are  `bronze`, `silver`,
`gold`, and `platinum`. Platinum users do not have a maximum number of project
requests, gold users can request up to 10 projects, silver users up to 7
projects, bronze users up to 5 projects, and any users without a label are by
default only allowed 2 projects.

Each user can only have one value per label. For example, a user cannot be both
`gold` and `silver` for the level label. However, when configuring the
*_master-config.yaml_* file, you could select users that have any value for a
label with a wildcard; for example, `level=*`.

To define privilege levels for project requests:

. Apply label selectors to users. For example, to apply the `level` label selector with a value of `bronze`:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ oc label user <user_name> level=bronze
----
+
Repeat this step for all bronze users, and then for the other levels.
. Optionally, verify the previous step by viewing the list of labeled users for each value:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ oc get users -l level=bronze
$ oc get users -l level=silver
$ oc get users -l level=gold
$ oc get users -l level=platinum
----
+
If you need to remove a label from a user to make a correction:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ oc label user <user_name> level-
----
. Modify the *_master-config.yaml_* file to define project limits for this label with the numbers stated in this use case. Find the `admissionConfig` line and create the configuration below it:
+
[source,yaml]
----
admissionConfig:
  pluginConfig:
    ProjectRequestLimit:
      configuration:
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: ProjectRequestLimitConfig
        limits:
        - selector:
            level: platinum
        - selector:
            level: gold
          maxProjects: 10
        - selector:
            level: silver
          maxProjects: 7
        - selector:
            level: bronze
          maxProjects: 5
        - maxProjects: 2
----
+
. Restart the master host for the changes to take effect.
+
[source, bash]
----
$ systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api atomic-openshift-master-controllers
----

[NOTE]
====
If you use a custom project template to limit the number of projects per user,
then  you must ensure that you keep the modifications by including the
following:

----
ProjectRequester = "openshift.io/requester"
----

Ownership is established using the `*openshift.io/requester*` annotation, so
your custom project template must have the same annotation.
====

[[control-monitor-resources]]
=== Controlling and Monitoring Resource Usage

If you configure a project to have ResourceQuota restrictions, then the amount
of the defined quota currently being used is stored on the ResourceQuota object
itself. In that case, you could check the amount of used resources, such as CPU
usage:

[source, bash]
----
$ oc get quota
----

However, this would not tell you what is actually being consumed.
To determine what is actually being consumed, use the `oc describe` command:

[source, bash]
----
$ oc describe quota <quota-name>
----

Alternatively, you can set up
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#install-config-cluster-metrics[cluster metrics] for more detailed statistics.

[[determine-default-user-roles]]
== Determining Which Roles Users Get by Default

When a user first logs in, there is a default set of permissions that is
applied to that user. The scope of permissions that a user can have is
controlled by the
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[various types]
of
xref:../admin_guide/manage_rbac.adoc#admin-guide-manage-rbac[roles within OpenShift]:

- `ClusterRoles`
- `ClusterRoleBindings`
- `Roles` (project-scoped)
- `RoleBindings` (project-scoped)

You may want to modify the default set of permissions. In order to do this, it's important to understand the default groups and roles assigned, and to be aware of the roles and users bound to
xref:../admin_solutions/user_role_mgmt.adoc#view-roles-users-project[each project] or
xref:../admin_solutions/user_role_mgmt.adoc#view-roles-users-cluster[the entire cluster].

=== Leveraging Default Groups

There are special groups that are assigned to users. You can target users with these groups, but you cannot modify them. These special groups are as follows:

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===

|Group |Description

|`system:authenticated`
|This is assigned to all users who are identifiable to the API. Everyone who is not `system:anonymous` (the user) is in this group.

|`system:authenticated:oauth`
|This is assigned to all users who have identified using an oauth token issued by the embedded oauth server. This is not applied to service accounts (they use service account tokens), or certificate users.

|`system:unauthenticated`
|This is assigned to users who have not presented credentials. Invalid credentials are rejected with a 401 error, so this is specifically users who did not try to authenticate at all.
|===

You may find it helpful to target users with the special groups listed above.
For example, you could share a template with all users by granting
`system:authenticated` access to the template.

The "default" permissions of users are defined by which roles are bound to the
`system:authenticated` and `sytem:authenticated:oauth` groups. As mentioned
above, you are not able to modify membership to these groups, but you can
xref:../admin_guide/manage_rbac.adoc#managing-role-bindings[change the roles bound to these groups].
For example, to bind a role to the `system:authenticated` group for all projects
in the cluster:

----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-group <role> system:authenticated
----

Currently, by default the `system:authenticated` and `sytem:authenticated:oauth`
groups receive the following roles:

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===

|Role |Description

|`shared-resource-viewer`
|For the `openshift` project. Allows users to see templates and pull images.

|`basic-user`
|For the the entire cluster. Allows users to see their own account, check for information about requesting projects, see which projects they can view, and check their own permissions.

|`self-provisioner`
|Allows users to request projects.

|`system:oauth-token-deleter`
|Allows users to delete any oauth token for which they know the details.

|`cluster-status`
|Allows users to see which APIs are enabled, and basic API server information such as versions.

|`system:webhook`
|Allows users to hit the webhooks for a build if they have enough additional information.

[[control-user-roles]]
== Controlling User Permissions with Roles

You can define
xref:../admin_guide/manage_rbac.adoc#admin-guide-manage-rbac[roles] (or permissions)
for a user before their initial log in so they can start working immediately.
You can assign many different types of roles to users such as admin,
basic-user, self-provisioner, and cluster-reader.

For a complete list of all available roles:

[source, bash]
----
$ oc adm policy
----

The following section includes examples of some common operations related to
adding (binding) and removing roles from users and groups. For a complete list
of available local policy operations, see
xref:../admin_guide/manage_rbac.adoc#managing-role-bindings[Managing Role Bindings].

=== Adding a Role to a User

To bind a role to a user for the current project:

[source, bash]
----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user <role> <user_name>
----

You can specify a project with the `-n` flag.

=== Removing a Role from a User

To remove a role from a user for the current project:

[source, bash]
----
$ oc adm policy remove-role-from-user <role> <user_name>
----

You can specify a project with the `-n` flag.

=== Adding a Cluster Role to a User for All Projects

from a user for all projects:

[source, bash]
----
$ oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-user <role> <user_name>
----

=== Adding a Role to a Group

To bind a role to a specified group in the current project:

[source, bash]
----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-group <role> <groupname>
----

You can specify a project with the `-n` flag.

=== Removing a Role from a Group

To remove a role from a specified group in the current project:

[source, bash]
----
$ oc adm policy remove-role-from-group <role> <groupname>
----

You can specify a project with the `-n` flag.

=== Adding a Cluster Role to a Group for All Projects

To bind a role to a specified group for all projects in the cluster:

[source, bash]
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-group <role> <groupname>
----

=== Removing a Cluster Role from a Group for All Projects

To remove a role from a specified group for all projects in the cluster:

[source, bash]
----
$ oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-group <role> <groupname>
----

[[role-binding-restriction]]
== Restricting Role Bindings

By default, a project administrator can create role bindings within the project
that specify any users, groups, or service accounts in the cluster as subjects
of those bindings. However, the cluster administrator can define restrictions in
order to allow only specific subjects.

The administrator defines these restrictions in the form of
`RoleBindingRestriction` objects. An individual `RoleBindingRestriction` object is
specific to a project or namespace. Role bindings in a namespace are restricted
by the `RoleBindingRestriction` objects in that namespace. Restrictions on
subjects are enforced as follows:

. If no `RoleBindingRestriction` object exists within a particular namespace, then
no restrictions are enforced in that namespace (for example, any subject is allowed).

. If any `RoleBindingRestriction` object in the namespace matches a subject, then
that subject is allowed.

. If one or more `RoleBindingRestriction` objects exist in the namespace, but none
matches a given subject, then that subject is not allowed.

Each `RoleBindingRestriction` object can match subjects of one type: users,
groups, or service accounts. Users can be matched by name, label selector, or
group membership. Groups can be matched by name or label selector. Service
accounts can be matched by name or namespace.

Role binding restrictions are enforced by the `RestrictSubjectBindings` admission
control plug-in, which is disabled by default. To enable it, add the following
stanza to the *_master-config.yaml_* file:

[source,yaml]
----
admissionConfig:
  pluginConfig:
    openshift.io/RestrictSubjectBindings:
      configuration:
        apiversion: v1
        kind: DefaultAdmissionConfig
----

Restart the {product-title} master for the change to take effect:
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[source, bash]
----
# systemctl restart origin-master-api origin-master-controllers
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[source, bash]
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api atomic-openshift-master-controllers
----
endif::[]

The following example creates a role binding restriction that permits role
bindings that have matching users as subjects:

.Example Role Binding Restriction Matching Users
[source, bash]
----
$ oc create -f - -n group1 <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: RoleBindingRestriction
metadata:
  name: match-users
spec:
  userrestriction: <1>
    users: <2>
    - john
    - jane
    groups: <3>
    - group1
    labels: <4>
    - mvp: true
EOF
rolebindingrestriction "match-users" created
----
<1> Match against user subjects. A `RoleBindingRestriction` specification must specify
exactly one of `userrestriction`, `grouprestriction`, or
`serviceaccountrestriction`.
<2> Match any user with the name `john` or `jane`.
<3> Match any user that is in the `group1` group.
<4> Match any user that matches the specified label selector.

With the foregoing `RoleBindingRestriction`, role bindings with the subject
`john` or `jane` will be allowed. Role bindings with subjects that are members
of the `group1` group, or that match the specified label, will also be
allowed. The admission control plug-in will prohibit bindings with any subject
that is not matched by some `RoleBindingRestriction` in the namespace:

.Example of RoleBindingRestriction Enforcement
[source, bash]
----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user view joe -n group1
Error from server: rolebindings "view" is forbidden: rolebindings to User "joe" are not allowed in project "group1"
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user view john jane -n group1
$ oc get rolebindings/view -n group1
NAME      ROLE      USERS        GROUPS    SERVICE ACCOUNTS   SUBJECTS
view      /view     john, jane
----

The following example creates a role binding restriction that permits role
bindings with the group `group2` as the subject:

.Example Role Binding Restriction Matching Groups
[source, bash]
----
$ oc create -f - -n group2 <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: RoleBindingRestriction
metadata:
  name: match-groups
spec:
  grouprestriction: <1>
    groups:
    - group2 <2>
    labels:
    - division: four <3>
EOF
rolebindingrestriction "match-groups" created
----
<1> Match against group subjects.
<2> Match any group with the name `group2`.
<3> Match any group that matches the specified label selector.

.Example Role Binding Restriction Matching Service Accounts
[source, bash]
----
$ oc create -f - -n group2 <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: RoleBindingRestriction
metadata:
  name: match-sa
spec:
  serviceaccountrestriction: <1>
    serviceaccounts:
    - name: service_account_name1
      namespace: namespace1 <2>
    - name: service_account_name2
      namespace: "" <3>
    namespaces:
    - namespace2 <4>
EOF
rolebindingrestriction "match-sa" created
----
<1> Match against service account subjects.
<2> Match any service account with the name `service_account_name1` in the
 namespace called `namespace1`.
<3> Match any service account with the name `service_account_name2` in the same
namespace as the `RoleBindingRestriction` object.
<4> Match any service account in the `namespace2` namespace.

== Sharing Templates for Use in Projects Across the Cluster

Templates are project-scoped resources, so you cannot create them to be readily
available at a cluster level. The easiest way to share templates across the entire
cluster is with the `openshift` project, which by default is already set up to
share templates. The templates can be annotated, and are displayed in the web
console where users can access them. Users have `get` access only to the
templates and images in this project, via the `shared-resource-viewer` role.

The `shared-resource-viewer` role exists to allow templates to be shared across
project boundaries. Users with this role have the ability to see all existing
templates and pull images from that project. However, the user still needs to
know which project to look in, because they will not be able to view the project
in their `oc get projects` list.

By default, this role is granted to the `system:authenticated` group in the
`openshift` project. This allows users to process the
specified template from the `openshift` project and create the items in the
current project:

[source, bash]
----
$ oc process openshift//<template-name> | oc create -f -
----

You can also add the registry viewer role to a user, allowing them to view and
pull images from a project:

[source, bash]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user registry-viewer <user-name>
----

== Creating a Cluster Administrator User

Cluster administrator is a very powerful role, which has ultimate control
within the cluster, including the power to destroy that cluster. You can grant
this role to other users if they absolutely need to have ultimate control.
However, you may first want to examine the other available roles if you do not
want to create such a powerful user. For example, `admin` is a constrained
role that has the power to do many things inside of their project, but cannot
affect (or destroy) the entire cluster.

=== Creating an Administrator Within a Project

To create a basic administrator role within a project:

[source, bash]
----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user admin <user_name> -n <project_name>
----

=== Creating a Cluster Administrator

To create a cluster administrator with ultimate control over the cluster:

[WARNING]
====
Be very careful when granting cluster administrator role to a user. Ensure that
the user truly needs that level of power within the cluster. When OpenShift is
first installed, a certificate based user is created and the credentials are
saved in *_admin.kubeconfig_*. This cluster administrator user can do absolutely
anything to any resource on the entire cluster, which can result in destruction
if not used carefully.
====

[source, bash]
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin <user_name>
