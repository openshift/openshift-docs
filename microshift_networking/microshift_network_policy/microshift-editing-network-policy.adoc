toc::[]

You can edit an existing network policy for a namespace. Typical edits might include changes to the pods to which the policy applies, allowed ingress traffic, and the destination ports on which to accept traffic. The `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `name` fields must not be changed when editing `NetworkPolicy` objects, as these define the resource itself.
