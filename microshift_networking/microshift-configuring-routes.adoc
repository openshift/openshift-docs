To enable {microshift-short} node access for services, configure the cluster routes. By using this configuration, you can expose specific applications directly through the network interface of the node.

Secure routes provide the ability to use several types of TLS termination to serve certificates to the client. See the _Additional resources_ section for links to the {OCP} documentation that describe how to create re-encrypt, edge, and passthrough routes with custom certificates.
