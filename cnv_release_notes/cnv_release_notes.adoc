== New and changed features

==== Virtual machine control from the web console
** The updated {ProductName} web console now allows users to create virtual 
machines, access virtual machines with either a serial or VNC connection, and 
perform basic power management tasks (start|stop) on virtual machines. 

==== Layer-2 networking
** Layer-2 networking capabilities are now exposed to the {ProductName} 
web console. Users can control the type of vNIC that is exposed to a virtual 
machine, connect a virtual machine to an enterprise network defined by a VLAN 
ID, and more.

==== Upload existing virtual machine images into templates
** You can upload an existing image into a template, which can then be used to 
create new virtual machines.

==== Clone virtual machines
** You can clone the PVC of an existing virtual machine disk into a new 
DataVolume, which can then be used to create a new virtual machine.

== Known issues

* Gluster nodes do not deploy on {product-title} version 3.11.43 
with CRI-O as the container runtime. Therefore, Red Hat OpenShift Container 
Storage versions before 3.11.1 are incompatible with {ProductName}.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1651270[(BZ#1651270)]

* The `runc` package version `runc-1.0.0-54` may cause the 
virt-launcher to crash if FIPS is disabled. If FIPS is disabled, RHOCS may also 
crash. Do not use this version of `runc` with {ProductName}.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1650512[(BZ1650512)]
** *Workaround:* Use the newer `runc-1.0.0-57` package instead.

* After creating a PVC with CDI annotation, if you attach the PVC to 
a VM object and start the VM before allowing CDI to complete, the VM 
may erroneously be listed as `Running` with no errors shown in the web 
console. https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1640505[(BZ#1640505)]

* In the Create VM Wizard, using the `PXE` source option with the `Start VM on 
creation` option will result in the boot order not changing after stopping 
and starting the VM. The VM will boot from the PXE NIC instead of the 
disk. https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1648245[(BZ#1648245)] 
** Restarting the VM will not solve this issue.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1647447[(BZ#1647447)]
** *Workaround:* Stop and start the VM again, and the boot order should change 
as expected.

* Deploying with `kubevirt-apb` and creating a VM from template may result 
in the following error: 
+
----
Unable to pull image: Back-off pulling image 
"registry:5000/kubevirt/fedora-cloud-registry-disk-demo:devel"
----
+
This may cause VM creation to get stuck. 
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1632255[(BZ#1632255)]
+
** This will be fixed with the introduction of operators in CNV 1.4.
