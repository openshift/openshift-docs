[[scaling-performance-preinstalling-dependencies]]
== Pre-installing Dependencies

A node host will access the network to install any RPMs dependencies, such as
`atomic-openshift-*`, `iptables`, and `docker`. Pre-installing these
dependencies, creates a more efficient install, because the RPMs are only
accessed when necessary, instead of a number of times per host during the
install.

This is also useful for machines that cannot access the registry for security
purposes.

[[scaling-performance-install-optimization]]
== Ansible Install Optimization

The {product-title} install method uses Ansible. Ansible is useful for running
parallel operations, meaning a fast and efficient installation. However, these
can be improved upon with additional tuning options. See the
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-ansible[Configuring
Ansible section] for a list of available Ansible configuration options.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Parallel behavior can overwhelm a content source, such as your image registry or
Red Hat Satellite server. Preparing your server's infrastructure pods and
operating system patches can help prevent this issue. 
====

Run the installer from the lowest-possible latency control node (LAN speeds).
Running over a wide area network (WAN) is not advised, neither is running the
installation over a lossy network connection.

Ansible provides its own
link:https://www.ansible.com/blog/ansible-performance-tuning[guidance for
performance and scaling], including using RHEL 6.6 or later to ensure the
version of OpenSSH supports `ControlPersist`, and running the installer from the
same LAN as the cluster, but _not_ running it from a machine in the cluster.

The following is an example Ansible configuration for large cluster installation
and administration that incorporates the recommendations documented by Ansible:

----
# cat /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
# config file for ansible -- http://ansible.com/
# ==============================================
[defaults]
forks = 20 <1>
host_key_checking = False
remote_user = root
roles_path = roles/
gathering = smart
fact_caching = jsonfile
fact_caching_connection = $HOME/ansible/facts
fact_caching_timeout = 600
log_path = $HOME/ansible.log  
nocows = 1  
callback_whitelist = profile_tasks

[privilege_escalation]
become = False

[ssh_connection]
ssh_args = -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=600s
control_path = %(directory)s/%%h-%%r
pipelining = True <2>
timeout = 10
----
<1> 20 forks is ideal, because larger forks can lead to installations failing.
<2> Pipelining reduces the number of connections between control and target nodes, helping to improve installer performance.

[[scaling-performance-networking-considerations]]
== Networking Considerations

Network subnets can be changed post-install, but with difficulty. It is much
easier to consider the network subnet size prior to installation, because
underestimating the size can create problems with growing clusters.

See the
xref:../scaling_performance/network_optimization.adoc#scaling-performance-network-subnetting[Network
Optimization topic] for recommended network subnetting practices.
