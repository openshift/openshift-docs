[[Guidance-For-Databases]]
== {gluster-native} Guidance for Databases
When you use {gluster-native} for applications, follow the guidance and best practices provided in this topic so 
that you can make informed choices between gluster-block and GlusterFS modes based on your type of workload.


[[Tested-Applciations]]
== Tested Applications 
In {product-title} 3.10, extensive testing was done with these (no)SQL databases:

-  Postgresql SQL v9.6 
-  MongoDB noSQL v3.2

The storage for these databases originated from a {gluster-native} storage cluster.

For Postgresql SQL benchmarking link:https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/pgbench.html[pgbench] was used for database benchmarking.
For MongoDB noSQL benchmarking YCSB link:https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/tree/master/mongodb[Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark] was used for benchmarking and link:https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/tree/master/workloads[workloada,workloadb,workloadf] were tested

The performance translators for GlusterFS, as mentioned above, are already part of the database profile delivered with 
the latest {gluster-native} images.

[[Test-Results]]
== Test Results
For Postgresql SQL databases, GlusterFS and gluster-block showed approximately the same performance results.
For MongoDB noSQL databases, gluster-block performed better. Therefore, use gluster-block based storage for MongoDB noSQL databases.
