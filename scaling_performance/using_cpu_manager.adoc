== What CPU Manager Does

CPU Manager manages groups of CPUs and constrains workloads to specific CPUs.

CPU Manager is useful for workloads that have some of these attributes:

* Require as much CPU time as possible.
* Are sensitive to processor cache misses.
* Are low-latency network applications.
* Coordinate with other processes and benefit from sharing a single processor
cache.

== Setting up CPU Manager

To set up CPU Manager:

. Optionally, label a node:
+
----
# oc label node perf-node.example.com cpumanager=true
----

. Enable CPU manager support on the target node:
+
----
# cat /etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml
...
kubeletArguments:
...
  feature-gates:
  - CPUManager=true
  cpu-manager-policy:
  - static
  cpu-manager-reconcile-period:
  - 5s
  kube-reserved: <1>
  - cpu=500m

# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
----
<1> `kube-reserved` is a required setting. The value may need to be adjusted
depending on your environment.

. Create a pod that requests a core or multiple cores. Both limits and requests
must have their CPU value set to a whole integer. That is the number of cores
that will be dedicated to this pod:
+
----
# cat cpumanager.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  generateName: cpumanager-
spec:
  containers:
  - name: cpumanager
    image: gcr.io/google_containers/pause-amd64:3.0
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 1
        memory: "1G"
      limits:
        cpu: 1
        memory: "1G"
  nodeSelector:
    cpumanager: "true"
----

. Create the pod:
+
----
# oc create -f cpumanager.yaml
----

. Verify that the pod is scheduled to the node that you labeled:
+
----
# oc describe pod cpumanager
Name:         cpumanager-4gdtn
Namespace:    test
Node:         perf-node.example.com/172.31.62.105
...
    Limits:
      cpu:     1
      memory:  1G
    Requests:
      cpu:        1
      memory:     1G
...
QoS Class:       Guaranteed
Node-Selectors:  cpumanager=true
                 region=primary
----

. Verify that the `cgroups` are set up correctly. Get the PID of the pause process:
+
----
# systemd-cgls -l
├─1 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd --system --deserialize 20
├─kubepods.slice
│ ├─kubepods-pod0ec1ab8b_e1c4_11e7_bb22_027b30990a24.slice
│ │ ├─docker-b24e29bc4021064057f941dc5f3538595c317d294f2c8e448b5e61a29c026d1c.scope
│ │ │ └─44216 /pause
----
+
Pods of QoS tier `Guaranteed` are placed within the `kubepods.slice`. Pods of other
QoS tiers end up in child `cgroups` of `kubepods`.
+
----
# cd /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/kubepods.slice/kubepods-pod0ec1ab8b_e1c4_11e7_bb22_027b30990a24.slice/docker-b24e29bc4021064057f941dc5f3538595c317d294f2c8e448b5e61a29c026d1c.scope
# for i in `ls cpuset.cpus tasks` ; do echo -n "$i "; cat $i ; done
cpuset.cpus 2
tasks 44216
----

. Check the allowed CPU list for the task:
+
----
# grep ^Cpus_allowed_list /proc/44216/status
Cpus_allowed_list:      2
----

. Verify that another pod (in this case, the pod in the `burstable` QoS tier) on
the system can not run on the core allocated for the `Guaranteed` pod:
+

# cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/kubepods.slice/kubepods-burstable.slice/kubepods-burstable-podbe76ff22_dead_11e7_b99e_027b30990a24.slice/docker-da621bea7569704fc39f84385a179923309ab9d832f6360cccbff102e73f9557.scope/cpuset.cpus

+
This VM has four CPU cores. You set `kube-reserved` to 500 millicores, meaning
half of one core is subtracted from the total capacity of the node to arrive at
the `Node Allocatable` amount.
+
You can see that `Allocatable CPU` is 3500 millicores. This means we can run three of
our CPU manager pods since each will take one whole core. A whole core is
equivalent to 1000 millicores.
+
If you try to schedule a fourth pod, the system will accept the pod, but it will
never be scheduled:
