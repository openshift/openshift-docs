== Scaling {product-title} HAProxy Router

[[scaling-performance-baseline-router-haproxy]]
=== Baseline Performance

The {product-title}
xref:../install_config/router/index.adoc#install-config-router-overview[router]
is the ingress point for all external traffic destined for {product-title}
services.

On an public cloud instance of size 4 vCPU/16GB RAM, a single HAProxy router is able to handle
between 7000-32000 HTTP keep-alive requests depending on encryption, page size,
and the number of connections used. For example, when using TLS
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#edge-termination[edge] or
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#re-encryption-termination[re-encryption]
terminations with large page sizes and a high numbers of connections, expect to
see results in the lower range. With HTTP keep-alive, a single HAProxy router is
capable of saturating 1 Gbit NIC at page sizes as small as 8 kB.

The table below shows HTTP keep-alive performance on such a public cloud
instance with a single HAProxy and 100 routes:

[cols="2,3,3",options="header"]
|===
|*Encryption* |*Page size* |*HTTP(s) requests per second*
|none |1kB |15435
|none |4kB |11947
|edge |1kB |7467
|edge |4kB |7678
|passthrough |1kB |25789
|passthrough |4kB |17876
|re-encrypt |1kB |7611
|re-encrypt |4kB |7395

|===

When running on bare metal with modern processors, you can expect roughly
twice the performance of the public cloud instance above. This
overhead is introduced by the virtualization layer in place on public clouds and
holds mostly true for private cloud-based virtualization as well. The following
table is a guide on how many applications to use behind the router:

[cols="2,4",options="header"]
|===
|*Number of applications* |*Application type*
|5-10 |static file/web server or caching proxy
|100-1000 |applications generating dynamic content

|===

In general, HAProxy can saturate about 5-1000 applications, depending on the
technology in use. The number will typically be lower for applications serving
only static content.

xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#router-sharding[Router sharding]
should be used to serve more routes towards applications and help horizontally
scale the routing tier.

[[scaling-performance-optimizing-router-haproxy]]
=== Performance Optimizations

[[scaling-performance-optimizing-router-haproxy-maxconn]]
==== Setting the Maximum Number of Connections

One of the most important tunable parameters for HAProxy scalability is the
`maxconn` parameter, which sets the maximum per-process number of concurrent
connections to a given number. Adjust this parameter by editing the
xref:../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#concurrent-connections[`ROUTER_MAX_CONNECTIONS`]
environment variable in the {product-title} HAProxy router's deployment
configuration file.

[[scaling-performance-optimizing-router-haproxy-cpu-affinity]]
==== CPU and Interrupt Affinity

In {product-title}, the HAProxy router runs as a single process. The
{product-title} HAProxy router typically performs better on a system with fewer
but high frequency cores, rather than on an symmetric multiprocessing (SMP)
system with a high number of lower frequency cores.

Pinning the HAProxy process to one CPU core and the network interrupts to
another CPU core tends to increase network performance. Having processes and
interrupts on the same non-uniform memory access (NUMA) node helps avoid memory
accesses by ensuring a shared L3 cache. However, this level of control is
generally not possible on a public cloud environment. On bare metal hosts,
`irqbalance` automatically handles peripheral component interconnect (PCI)
locality and NUMA affinity for interrupt request lines (IRQs). On a cloud
environment, this level of information is generally not provided to the
operating system.

CPU pinning is performed either by `taskset` or by using HAProxy's `cpu-map`
parameter. This directive takes two arguments: the process ID and the CPU core
ID. For example, to pin HAProxy process `1` onto CPU core `0`, add the following
line to the global section of HAProxy's configuration file:

----
    cpu-map 1 0
----

To modify the HAProxy configuration file, refer to
xref:../install_config/router/customized_haproxy_router.adoc#install-config-router-customized-haproxy[Deploying
a Customized HAProxy Router].

[[scaling-performance-optimizing-router-haproxy-bufsize]]
==== Impacts of Buffer Increases

The {product-title} HAProxy router request buffer configuration limits the size
of headers in incoming requests and responses from applications. The HAProxy
parameter `tune.bufsize` can be increased to allow processing of larger headers
and to allow applications with very large cookies to work, such as those
accepted by load balancers provided by many public cloud providers. However,
this affects the total memory use, especially when large numbers of connections
are open. With very large numbers of open connections, the memory usage will be
nearly proportionate to the increase of this tunable parameter.

[[scaling-performance-network-performance]]
== Optimizing Network Performance

The xref:../architecture/additional_concepts.adoc#openshift-sdn[OpenShift SDN]
uses OpenvSwitch, virtual extensible LAN (VXLAN) tunnels, OpenFlow rules, and
iptables. This network can be tuned by using jumbo frames, network interface
cards (NIC) offloads, multi-queue, and ethtool settings.

VXLAN provides benefits over VLANs, such as an increase in networks from 4096 to
over 16 million, and layer 2 connectivity across physical networks. This allows
for all pods behind a service to communicate with each other, even if they are
running on different systems.

VXLAN encapsulates all tunneled traffic in user datagram protocol (UDP) packets.
However, this leads to increased CPU utilization. Both these outer- and
inner-packets are subject to normal checksumming rules to guarantee data has not
been corrupted during transit. Depending on CPU performance, this additional
processing overhead can cause a reduction in throughput and increased latency
when compared to traditional, non-overlay networks.

Cloud, VM, and bare metal CPU performance can be capable of handling much more
than one Gbps network throughput. When using higher bandwidth links such as 10
or 40 Gbps, reduced performance can occur. This is a known issue in VXLAN-based
environments and is not specific to containers or {product-title}. Any network
that relies on VXLAN tunnels will perform similarly because of the VXLAN
implementation.

If you are looking to push beyond one Gbps, you can:

* Use
xref:../install_config/configuring_routing.adoc#install-config-configuring-native-container-routing[Native
Container Routing]. This option has important operational caveats that do not
exist when using OpenShift SDN, such as updating routing tables on a router.
* Evaluate network plug-ins that implement different routing techniques, such as
border gateway protocol (BGP).
* Use VXLAN-offload capable network adapters. VXLAN-offload moves the packet
checksum calculation and associated CPU overhead off of the system CPU and onto
dedicated hardware on the network adapter. This frees up CPU cycles for use by
pods and applications, and allows users to utilize the full bandwidth of their
network infrastructure.

VXLAN-offload does not reduce latency. However, CPU utilization is reduced even
in latency tests.

[[scaling-performance-optimizing-mtu]]
=== Optimizing the MTU for Your Network

There are two MTUs (maximum transmission units) that matter: the network
interface card (NIC) MTU, and the SDN overlay's MTU.

The NIC MTU must be less than or equal to the maximum supported value of the NIC
of your network. If you are optimizing for throughput, pick the largest possible
value. If you are optimizing for lowest latency, pick a lower value.

The SDN overlay's MTU must be less than the NIC MTU by 50 bytes at a
minimum. This accounts for the SDN overlay header. So, on a normal ethernet
network, set this to 1450. On a jumbo frame ethernet network, set this to 8950.

[NOTE]
====
This 50 byte overlay header is relevant to the OpenShift SDN. Other SDN
solutions might require the value to be more or less.
====

To configure the MTU, edit the node configuration file at *_/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml_*, and edit the following:

[source,yaml]
----
networkConfig:
  mtu: 1450 <1>
  networkPluginName: "redhat/openshift-ovs-subnet" <2>
----
<1> Maximum transmission unit (MTU) for the pod overlay network.
<2> Set to `redhat/openshift-ovs-subnet` for the *ovs-subnet* plug-in,
`redhat/openshift-ovs-multitenant` for the *ovs-multitenant* plug-in, or
`redhat/openshift-ovs-networkpolicy` for the *ovs-networkpolicy* plug-in. This
can also be set to any other CNI-compatible plug-in as well.


[[scaling-performance-network-subnetting]]
== Configuring Network Subnets

{product-title} provides IP address management for both pods and services. The
default values allow for:

- Maximum cluster size of 1024 nodes
- Each of the 1024 nodes has a /23 allocated to it (510 usable IPs for pods)
- Provides 65,536 IP addresses for services.

Under most circumstances, these networks cannot be changed after deployment.  Thus it is important to plan ahead for growth.

Restrictions for resizing networks are document here:
xref:../install_config/configuring_sdn.adoc#configuring-the-pod-network-on-masters[Configuring
SDN documentation].

If you would like to plan for a larger environment, here are some example values to consider adding to the `[OSE3:vars]` section in your
Ansible inventory file:

----
[OSE3:vars]
osm_cluster_network_cidr=10.128.0.0/10
----

This will allow for 8192 nodes, each with 510 usable IPs.

See the supportability limits in the {product-title} documentation for node/pod limits for the version of software you are installing.

[[scaling-performance-optimizing-ipsec]]
== Optimizing IPSec

Because encrypting and decrypting node hosts uses CPU power, performance is
affected both in throughput and CPU usage on the nodes when encryption is
enabled, regardless of the IP security system being used.

IPSec encrypts traffic at the IP level, before it hits the NIC, protecting
fields that would otherwise be used for NIC offloading. This means that some NIC
acceleration features may not be usable when IPSec is enabled and will lead to decreased throughput and increased CPU usage.
