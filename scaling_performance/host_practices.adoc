[[scaling-performance-capacity-host-practices-master]]
== Recommended Practices for {product-title} Master Hosts

In addition to pod traffic, the most-used data-path in an {product-title}
infrastructure is between the {product-title} master hosts and etcd. The
{product-title} API server (part of the master binary) consults etcd for node
status, network configuration, secrets, and more.

Optimize this traffic path by:

* Co-locating master hosts and etcd servers.

* Ensuring an uncongested, low latency LAN communication link between master hosts.

[[scaling-performance-capacity-host-practices-node]]
== Recommended Practices for {product-title} Node Hosts

The {product-title} node configuration file at
*_/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml_* contains important options, such as the
iptables synchronization period, the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the SDN network, and the proxy-mode.

The node configuration file allows you to pass arguments to the kubelet
(node) process. You can view a list of possible options by running `kubelet
--help`.

[NOTE]
====
Not all kubelet options are supported by {product-title}, and are used in the
upstream Kubernetes. This means certain options are in limited support.

See the xref:../install_config/install/planning.adoc#sizing[Sizing
Considerations] section in the installation documentation for the recommended
limits for an {product-title} cluster. The recommended sizing accounts for
{product-title} and Docker coordination for container status updates. This
coordination puts CPU pressure on the master and docker processes, which can
include writing a large amount of log data.

[[scaling-performance-capacity-host-practices-etcd]]
== Recommended Practices for {product-title} etcd Hosts

etcd is a distributed key-value store that {product-title} uses for
configuration.

|======================
|{product-title} Version |etcd version|storage schema version
|3.3 and earlier |2.x | v2
|3.4 and 3.5 |3.x | v2
|3.6 |3.x | v2 (upgrades)
|3.6 |3.x | v3 (new installations)
|======================

etcd 3.x introduces important scalability and performance improvements that reduce CPU, memory, network, and disk requirements for any size cluster. etcd 3.x also implements a backwards compatible storage API that facilitates a two-step migration of the on-disk etcd database. For migration purposes, the storage mode used by etcd 3.x in {product-title} 3.5 remained in v2 mode. As of {product-title} 3.6, new installs will use storage mode v3. Upgrades from previous versions of {product-title} will _not_ automatically migrate data from v2 to v3. You must use the supplied playbooks and follow the documented process to migrate the data.

Version 3 of etcd implements a backwards compatible storage API that facilitates a two-step migration of the on-disk etcd database. For migration purposes, the storage mode used by etcd 3.x in {product-title} 3.5 remained in v2 mode. As of {product-title} 3.6, new installs will use storage mode v3. In order to provide customers time to prepare for migrating the etcd schema from v2 to v3 (and associated downtime and verification), {product-title} 3.6 does not enforce this upgrade. However, based on extensive test results Red Hat strongly recommends migrating existing {product-title} clusters to etcd 3.x storage mode v3. This is particularly relevant in larger clusters, or in scenarios where SSD storage is not available.

[IMPORTANT]
====
etcd schema migration will be required by future {product-title} upgrades.
====

In addition to changing the storage mode for new installs to v3, {product-title} 3.6 also begins enforcing _quorum reads_ for all {product-title} types. This is done to ensure that queries against etcd do not return stale data. In single-node etcd clusters, stale data is not a concern. In highly available etcd deployments typically found in production clusters, quorum reads ensure valid query results. A quorum read is _linearizable_ in database terms - every client sees the latest updated state of the cluster, and all clients see the same sequence of reads and writes. Please see the etcd 3.1 link:https://coreos.com/blog/etcd-3-1-announcement.html[announcement] for more information on performance improvements.

It is important to note that {product-title} uses etcd for storing additional information beyond what Kubernetes itself requires. For example, {product-title} stores information about images, builds, and other components in etcd, as is required by features that {product-title} adds on top of Kubernetes. Ultimately, this means that guidance around performance and sizing for etcd hosts will differ from Kubernetes and other recommendations in salient ways. Red Hat tests etcd scalability and performance with the {product-title} use-case and parameters in mind to generate the most accurate recommendations.

Performance improvements were quantified using a 300-node {product-title} 3.6 cluster using the link:https://github.com/openshift/svt/tree/master/openshift_scalability[cluster-loader] utility.
Comparing etcd 3.x (storage mode v2) versus etcd 3.x (storage mode v3), clear improvements are identified in the charts below.

Storage IOPS under load is significantly reduced:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
image::full-run-iops.png["Full Run IOPS"]
endif::[]

Storage IOPS in steady state is also significantly reduced:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
image::steady-state-iops.png["Steady State IOPS"]
endif::[]

Viewing the same I/O data, plotting the average IOPS in both modes:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
image::average-read-write-iops.png["Read+Write IOPS"]
endif::[]

CPU utilization by both the API server (master) and etcd processes is reduced:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
image::cpu-usage.png["CPU Usage"]
endif::[]

Memory utilization by both the API server (master) and etcd processes is also reduced:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
image::memory-usage-rss.png["Memory Usage"]
endif::[]


[IMPORTANT]
====
After profiling etcd under {product-title}, etcd frequently performs small
amounts of storage input and output. Using etcd with storage that handles small
read/write operations quickly, such as SSD, is highly recommended.
====

Looking at the size I/O operations done by a 3-node cluster of etcd 3.1 (using storage v3 mode and with quorum reads enforced), read sizes are as follows:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
image::reads.png["Histogram of etcd I/O sizes"]
endif::[]

And writes:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
image::writes.png["Histogram of etcd I/O sizes"]
endif::[]

[NOTE]
====
etcd processes are typically memory intensive. Master / API server processes are CPU intensive. This makes them a reasonable co-location pair within a single machine or virtual machine (VM). Optimize communication between etcd and master hosts either by co-locating them on the same host, or providing a dedicated network.

[[scaling-performance-capacity-tuned-profile]]
== Scaling Hosts Using the TuneD Profile

TuneD is a tuning profile delivery mechanism enabled by default in Red Hat
Enterprise Linux and other Red Hat products. TuneD customizes Linux settings,
such as sysctls, power management, and kernel command line options, to optimize
the operating system for different workload performance and scalability
requirements.

{product-title} leverages the `tuned` daemon and includes TuneD profiles called
`atomic-openshift-host` and `atomic-openshift-guest`. These profiles safely
increase some of the commonly encountered vertical scaling limits present in the
kernel, and are automatically applied to your system during installation.

The TuneD profiles support inheritance between profiles. On an {product-title}
system, the findings delivered by TuneD will be the union of
`throughput-performance` (the default for RHEL) and `atomic-openshift-guest`.
TuneD will determine if you are running {product-title} on a virtual machine,
and, if so, automatically apply `virtual-guest` tuning as well.

To see which TuneD profile is enabled on your system, run:

----
# tuned-adm active
Current active profile: atomic-openshift-node-guest
----

Hat Enterprise Linux Performance Tuning Guide] for more information about TuneD.
