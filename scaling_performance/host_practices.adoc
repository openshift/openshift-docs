== Recommended Practices for {product-title} Master Hosts

In addition to pod traffic, the most-used data-path in an {product-title}
infrastructure is between the {product-title} master hosts and etcd. The
{product-title} API server (part of the master binary) consults etcd for node
status, network configuration, secrets, and more.

Optimize this traffic path by:

* Running etcd on master hosts. By default, etcd runs in a static pod on all
master hosts.

* Ensuring an uncongested, low latency LAN communication link between master hosts.

The {product-title} master caches deserialized versions of resources
aggressively to ease CPU load. However, in smaller clusters of less than 1000
pods, this cache can waste a lot of memory for negligible CPU load reduction.
The default cache size is 50,000 entries, which, depending on the size of your
resources, can grow to occupy 1 to 2 GB of memory.  This cache size can be
reduced using the following setting the in *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*:

----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  apiServerArguments:
    deserialization-cache-size:
    - "1000"
----

The number of client requests or API calls that are sent to the API server is determined
by the Queries per second (QPS) value and the number of concurrent requests that can be processed 
by the API server is determined by the maxRequestsInFlight setting. The number of requests the client
can make in excess of the QPS rate depends on the burst value, this is helpful for applications that are 
bursty in nature and can make irregular number of requests. The Response times for requests might have 
high latencies when there are large numbers of concurrent requests being handled by the API server especially 
for large and/or dense clusters. It is recommended to monitor the `apiserver_request_count` rate metric in 
Prometheus and adjust the `maxRequestsInFlight` and `QPS` accordingly. 

There needs to be a good balance when changing the default values as the CPU and memory consumption of 
API server and etcd IOPS will increase when it is handling more requests in parallel. Also note that heavy 
non-watch requests might overload the API server as they get cancelled after a fixed 60 second timeout and 
the client starts retrying. 

Provided sufficient CPU and memory resources are available on the API server system(s), the API server 
requests overloading issue can be safely alleviated by taking into account the factors mentioned above and 
bumping up the maxRequestsInFlight, API qps and burst values in the *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file:

----
masterClients:
  openshiftLoopbackClientConnectionOverrides:
    burst: 600
    qps: 300
servingInfo:
  maxRequestsInFlight: 500
----

[NOTE]
====
The maxRequestsInFlight, qps and burst values above are defaults for {product-title}.
The qps can be higher than maxRequestsInFlight value if the requests take less than a second.
If `maxRequestsInFlight' is set to zero, there is no limit on the number of concurrent requests that can be 
processed by the server.

[[scaling-performance-capacity-host-practices-node]]
== Recommended Practices for {product-title} Node Hosts

The {product-title} node configuration file contains important options, such as the
iptables synchronization period, the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the SDN network, and the proxy-mode.
To configure your nodes, modify the appropriate xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#modifying-nodes[node configuration map].

[NOTE]
====
Do not edit the `node-config.yaml` file directly.
==== 

The node configuration file allows you to pass arguments to the kubelet
(node) process. You can view a list of possible options by running `kubelet
--help`.

[NOTE]
====
Not all kubelet options are supported by {product-title}, and are used in the
upstream Kubernetes. This means certain options are in limited support.
====

include::admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc[tag=admin_guide_manage_nodes]

See the xref:../install/index.adoc#sizing[Sizing
Considerations] section in the installation documentation for the recommended
limits for an {product-title} cluster. The recommended sizing accounts for
{product-title} and container engine coordination for container status updates. This
coordination puts CPU pressure on the master and container engine processes, which can
include writing a large amount of log data.

//tag::node-qps-burst[]
The rate at which kubelet talks to API server depends on qps and burst values.
The default values are good enough if there are limited pods running on each node.
Provided there are enough CPU and memory resources on the node, the qps and burst
values can be tweaked in the  *_/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml_* file:

----
kubeletArguments:
  kube-api-qps:
  - "20"
  kube-api-burst:
  - "40"
----

[NOTE]
====
The qps and burst values above are defaults for {product-title}.

[[scaling-performance-capacity-host-practices-etcd]]
== Recommended Practices for {product-title} etcd Hosts

etcd is a distributed key-value store that {product-title} uses for
configuration.

|======================
|{product-title} Version |etcd version|storage schema version
|3.3 and earlier |2.x | v2
|3.4 and 3.5 |3.x | v2
|3.6 |3.x | v2 (upgrades)
|3.6 |3.x | v3 (new installations)
|3.7 and later |3.x | v3
|======================

etcd 3.x introduces important scalability and performance improvements that reduce CPU, memory, network, and disk requirements for any size cluster. etcd 3.x also implements a backwards compatible storage API that facilitates a two-step migration of the on-disk etcd database. For migration purposes, the storage mode used by etcd 3.x in {product-title} 3.5 remained in v2 mode. As of {product-title} 3.6, new installations use storage mode v3. Upgrades from previous versions of {product-title} will _not_ automatically migrate data from v2 to v3. You must use the supplied playbooks and follow the documented process to migrate the data.

Version 3 of etcd implements a backwards compatible storage API that facilitates a two-step migration of the on-disk etcd database. For migration purposes, the storage mode used by etcd 3.x in {product-title} 3.5 remained in v2 mode. As of {product-title} 3.6, new installations use storage mode v3.
As part of the process to upgrade to {product-title} 3.7, you upgrade your etcd
storage API to v3, if required. In versions 3.7 and later, you must use the v3 API. 

In addition to changing the storage mode for new installs to v3, {product-title} 3.6 also begins enforcing _quorum reads_ for all {product-title} types. This is done to ensure that queries against etcd do not return stale data. In single-node etcd clusters, stale data is not a concern. In highly available etcd deployments typically found in production clusters, quorum reads ensure valid query results. A quorum read is _linearizable_ in database terms - every client sees the latest updated state of the cluster, and all clients see the same sequence of reads and writes. See the etcd 3.1 link:https://coreos.com/blog/etcd-3-1-announcement.html[announcement] for more information on performance improvements.

It is important to note that {product-title} uses etcd for storing additional information beyond what Kubernetes itself requires. For example, {product-title} stores information about images, builds, and other components in etcd, as is required by features that {product-title} adds on top of Kubernetes. Ultimately, this means that guidance around performance and sizing for etcd hosts will differ from Kubernetes and other recommendations in salient ways. Red Hat tests etcd scalability and performance with the {product-title} use-case and parameters in mind to generate the most accurate recommendations.

Performance improvements were quantified using a 300-node {product-title} 3.6 cluster using the link:https://github.com/openshift/svt/tree/master/openshift_scalability[cluster-loader] utility.
Comparing etcd 3.x (storage mode v2) versus etcd 3.x (storage mode v3), clear improvements are identified in the charts below.

Storage IOPS under load is significantly reduced:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
image::full-run-iops.png["Full Run IOPS"]
endif::[]

Storage IOPS in steady state is also significantly reduced:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
image::steady-state-iops.png["Steady State IOPS"]
endif::[]

Viewing the same I/O data, plotting the average IOPS in both modes:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
image::average-read-write-iops.png["Read+Write IOPS"]
endif::[]

CPU utilization by both the API server (master) and etcd processes is reduced:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
image::cpu-usage.png["CPU Usage"]
endif::[]

Memory utilization by both the API server (master) and etcd processes is also reduced:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
image::memory-usage-rss.png["Memory Usage"]
endif::[]


[IMPORTANT]
====
After profiling etcd under {product-title}, etcd frequently performs small
amounts of storage input and output. Using etcd with storage that handles small
read/write operations quickly, such as SSD, is highly recommended.
====

Looking at the size I/O operations done by a 3-node cluster of etcd 3.1 (using storage v3 mode and with quorum reads enforced), read sizes are as follows:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
image::reads.png["Histogram of etcd I/O sizes"]
endif::[]

And writes:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
image::writes.png["Histogram of etcd I/O sizes"]
endif::[]

[NOTE]
====
etcd processes are typically memory intensive. Master / API server processes are CPU intensive. This makes them a reasonable co-location pair within a single machine or virtual machine (VM). Optimize communication between etcd and master hosts either by co-locating them on the same host, or providing a dedicated network.

=== Providing Storage to an etcd Node Using PCI Passthrough with OpenStack

To provide fast storage to an etcd node so that etcd is stable at large scale,
use PCI passthrough to pass a non-volatile memory express (NVMe) device directly
to the etcd node. To set this up with Red Hat OpenStack 11 or later, complete
the following on the OpenStack compute nodes where the PCI device exists.

. Ensure Intel Vt-x is enabled in BIOS.

. Enable the input–output memory management unit (IOMMU). In the
*_/etc/sysconfig/grub_* file, add `intel_iommu=on iommu=pt` to the end of the
`GRUB_CMDLINX_LINUX` line, within the quotation marks.

.  Regenerate *_/etc/grub2.cfg_* by running:
+
----
$ grub2-mkconfig -o /etc/grub2.cfg
----

. Reboot the system.

. On controllers in *_/etc/nova.conf_*:
+
----
[filter_scheduler]

enabled_filters=RetryFilter,AvailabilityZoneFilter,RamFilter,DiskFilter,ComputeFilter,ComputeCapabilitiesFilter,ImagePropertiesFilter,ServerGroupAntiAffinityFilter,ServerGroupAffinityFilter,PciPassthroughFilter

available_filters=nova.scheduler.filters.all_filters

[pci]

alias = { "vendor_id":"144d", "product_id":"a820",
"device_type":"type-PCI", "name":"nvme" }
----

. Restart `nova-api` and `nova-scheduler` on the controllers.

. On compute nodes in *_/etc/nova/nova.conf_*:
+
----
[pci]

passthrough_whitelist = { "address": "0000:06:00.0" }

alias = { "vendor_id":"144d", "product_id":"a820",
"device_type":"type-PCI", "name":"nvme" }
----
+
To retrieve the required `address`, `vendor_id`, and `product_id` values of the
NVMe device you want to passthrough, run:
+
----
# lspci -nn | grep devicename
----

. Restart `nova-compute` on the compute nodes.

. Configure the OpenStack version you are running to use the NVMe and launch the
etcd node.

[[scaling-performance-capacity-tuned-profile]]
== Scaling Hosts Using the Tuned Profile

*Tuned* is a tuning profile delivery mechanism enabled by default in Red Hat
Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and other Red Hat products. *Tuned* customizes Linux
settings, such as sysctls, power management, and kernel command line options, to
optimize the operating system for different workload performance and scalability
requirements.

{product-title} leverages the `tuned` daemon and includes *Tuned* profiles
called `openshift`, `openshift-node` and `openshift-control-plane`. These
profiles safely increase some of the commonly encountered vertical scaling
limits present in the kernel, and are automatically applied to your system
during installation.

The *Tuned* profiles support inheritance between profiles.  They also support
an auto-parent functionality which selects a parent profile based on whether the
profile is used in a virtual environment.  The `openshift` profile uses both of these
features and is a parent of `openshift-node` and `openshift-control-plane` profiles.
It contains tuning relevant to both {product-title} application nodes and control plane
nodes respectively. The `openshift-node` and `openshift-control-plane` profiles
are set on application and control plane nodes respectively.

The profile hierarchy with the `openshift` profile as a parent ensures the
tuning delivered to the {product-title} system is a union of
`throughput-performance` (the default for RHEL) for bare metal hosts
and `virtual-guest` for RHEL and `atomic-guest` for RHEL Atomic Host nodes.

To see which *Tuned* profile is enabled on your system, run:

----
# tuned-adm active
Current active profile: openshift-node
----

See the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html-single/Performance_Tuning_Guide/index.html#chap-Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux-Performance_Tuning_Guide-Tuned[Red
Hat Enterprise Linux Performance Tuning Guide] for more information about
*Tuned*.
