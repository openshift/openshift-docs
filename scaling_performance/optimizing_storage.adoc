== Optimizing Storage

Docker stores images and containers in a graph driver (a pluggable storage
backend), such as Device Mapper, Overlay, and Btrfs. Each have advantages and
disadvantages. For example, Overlay is faster than Device Mapper at starting and
stopping containers, but is not POSIX compliant because of the architectural
limitations of a union file system, and does not yet support SELinux.

For more information about Overlay, including supportability and usage caveats,
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html-single/7.3_Release_Notes/index.html#technology_previews_file_systems[see
the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 Release Notes].

In production environments, using a LVM thin pool on top of regular block
devices (not loop devices) for container images and container root file system
storage is recommended.

[NOTE]
====
Using a Loop device back-end can affect performance issues. While you can still
continue to use it, Docker logs a warning message. For example:

----
devmapper: Usage of loopback devices is strongly discouraged for production use.
Please use `--storage-opt dm.thinpooldev` or use `man docker` to refer to
dm.thinpooldev section.
----
====

To ease Docker back-end storage configuration, use the
`docker-storage-setup` utility, which automates much of the configuration
details:

. If you had a separate disk drive dedicated to Docker storage (for example,
*_/dev/xvdb_*), add the following to the *_/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup_*
file:
+
----
DEVS=/dev/xvdb
VG=docker_vg
----

. Restart the `docker-storage-setup` service:
+
----
# systemctl restart docker-storage-setup
----
+
After the restart, `docker-storage-setup` sets up a volume group named
`docker_vg` and creates a thin pool logical volume. Documentation for thin
provisioning on RHEL is available in the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html-single/Logical_Volume_Manager_Administration/index.html[LVM
Administrator Guide]. View the newly created volumes with the `lsblk` command:
+
----
# lsblk /dev/xvdb
NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvdb 202:16 0 20G 0 disk
└─xvdb1 202:17 0 10G 0 part
  ├─docker_vg-docker--pool_tmeta 253:0 0 12M 0 lvm
  │ └─docker_vg-docker--pool 253:2 0 6.9G 0 lvm
  └─docker_vg-docker--pool_tdata 253:1 0 6.9G 0 lvm
  └─docker_vg-docker--pool 253:2 0 6.9G 0 lvm
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Thin-provisioned volumes are not mounted and have no file system (individual
containers do have an XFS file system), thus they will not show up in “df”
output.
====

. To verify that Docker is using a LVM thin pool, and to monitor disk space
utilization, use the `docker info` command. The `Pool Name` will correspond with
the `VG` you specified in *_/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup_*:
+
----
# docker info | egrep -i 'storage|pool|space|filesystem'
Storage Driver: devicemapper
 Pool Name: docker_vg-docker--pool
 Pool Blocksize: 524.3 kB
 Backing Filesystem: xfs
 Data Space Used: 62.39 MB
 Data Space Total: 6.434 GB
 Data Space Available: 6.372 GB
 Metadata Space Used: 40.96 kB
 Metadata Space Total: 16.78 MB
 Metadata Space Available: 16.74 MB
----

By default, a thin pool is configured to use 40% of the underlying block device.
As you use the storage, LVM automatically extends the thin pool up to 100%. This
is why the `Data Space Total` value does not match the full size of the
underlying LVM device. This auto-extend technique was used to unify the storage
approach taken in both Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Atomic Host, which
only uses a single partition.

In development, Docker in Red Hat distributions defaults to a
loopback mounted sparse file. To see if your system is using the loopback mode:

----
# docker info|grep loop0
 Data file: /dev/loop0
refarch-feedback@redhat.com 16 www.redhat.com
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Red Hat strongly recommends using the Device Mapper storage driver in thin pool
mode for production workloads.
====

Overlay is also supported for Docker use cases as of Red Hat Enterprise Linux
7.2, and provides faster start up time and page cache sharing, which can
potentially improve density by reducing overall memory utilization.

[[benefits-of-using-the-overlay-graph-driver]]
== Benefits of Using the Overlay Graph Driver with SELinux

The default Docker storage configuration on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
continues to be Device Mapper. While the use of Overlay as the containers
storage back-end is being monitored, moving RHEL to Overlay as the default in
future releases is under consideration. As of RHEL 7.2, Overlay became a
supported graph driver. As of RHEL 7.4, SELinux and the Overlay2 graph driver
became a supported combination.

The main advantage of the Overlay file system is Linux page cache sharing among
containers sharing an image on the same node. This attribute of Overlay leads to
reduced input/output (I/O) during container startup (and, thus, faster container
startup time by several hundred milliseconds), as well as reduced memory usage
when similar images are running on a node. Both of these results are beneficial
in many environments, especially those with the goal of optimizing for density
and have high container churn rate (such as a build farm), or those that have
significant overlap in image content.

Page cache sharing is not possible with Device Mapper because thin-provisioned
devices are allocated on a per-container basis.
