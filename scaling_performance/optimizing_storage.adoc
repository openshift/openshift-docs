[[application-storage-recommendations]]
=== Specific Application Storage Recommendations

[[registry]]
==== Registry

In a non-scaled/high-availability (HA) {product-title} registry cluster deployment:

* The preferred storage technology is object storage followed by block storage. The
storage technology does not need to support RWX access mode.
* The storage technology must ensure read-after-write consistency. All NAS storage (excluding CNS/CRS GlusterFS as it uses an object storage interface) are not
recommended for {product-title} Registry cluster deployment with production workloads.
* While `hostPath` volumes are configurable for a non-scaled/HA {product-title} Registry, they are not recommended for cluster deployment.

[WARNING]
====
Corruption may occur when using NFS to back {product-title} registry with production workloads.
====

[[scaled-registry]]
==== Scaled Registry

In a scaled/HA {product-title} registry cluster deployment:

* The preferred storage technology is object storage. The storage technology must support RWX access mode and must ensure read-after-write consistency.
* File storage and block storage are not recommended for a scaled/HA {product-title} registry cluster deployment with production workloads.
* All NAS storage (excluding CNS/CRS GlusterFS as it uses an object storage interface) are
not recommended for {product-title} Registry cluster deployment with production workloads.

[WARNING]
====
Corruption may occur when using NFS to back {product-title} scaled/HA registry with production workloads.
====

[[metrics]]
==== Metrics

In an {product-title} hosted metrics cluster deployment:

* The preferred storage technology is block storage.
* It is not recommended to use NAS storage (excluding CNS/CRS GlusterFS as it uses a block storage interface from iSCSI) for a hosted metrics cluster deployment with production workloads.

[WARNING]
====
Corruption may occur when using NFS to back a hosted metrics cluster deployment with production workloads.
====

[[logging]]
==== Logging

In an {product-title} hosted logging cluster deployment:

* The preferred storage technology is block storage.
* It is not recommended to use NAS storage (excluding CNS/CRS GlusterFS as it uses a block storage interface from iSCSI) for a hosted metrics cluster deployment with production workloads.

[WARNING]
====
Corruption may occur when using NFS to back hosted logging with production workloads.
====

[[applications]]
==== Applications

Application use cases vary from application to application, as described in the following examples:

* Storage technologies that support dynamic PV provisioning have low mount time latencies, and are not tied
to nodes to support a healthy cluster.
* NFS does not guarantee read-after-write consistency and is not recommended for applications which require it.
* Applications that depend on writing to the same, shared NFS export may experience issues with production workloads.

[[other-storage-recommendations]]
=== Other Specific Application Storage Recommendations

* {product-title} Internal *etcd*: For the best etcd reliability, the lowest consistent latency storage technology is preferable.
* OpenStack Cinder: OpenStack Cinder tends to be adept in ROX access mode use cases.
* Databases: Databases (RDBMSs, NoSQL DBs, etc.) tend to perform best with dedicated block storage.

[[choosing-a-graph-driver]]
== Choosing a Graph Driver

Container runtimes store images and containers in a graph driver (a pluggable
storage technology), such as DeviceMapper and OverlayFS. Each has advantages
and disadvantages.

For more information about OverlayFS, including supportability and usage caveats, see the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/?version=7[Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 Release Notes] for your version.

.Graph Driver Comparisons
|===
|Name |Description |Benefits |Limitations

|Device Mapper loop-lvm
|Uses the Device Mapper thin provisioning module (dm-thin-pool) to implement
copy-on-write (CoW) snapshots. For each device mapper graph location, thin pool
is created based on two block devices, one for data and one for metadata. By
default, these block devices are created automatically by using loopback mounts
of automatically created sparse files.
|It works out of the box, so it is useful for prototyping and development purposes.
a|* Not all Portable Operating System Interface for Unix (POSIX) features work (for
example, `O_DIRECT`). Most importantly, this mode is unsupported for production
workloads.
* All containers and images share the same pool of capacity. It cannot be resized
without destroying and re-creating the pool.

|Device Mapper Thin Provisioning
|Also uses LVM, Device Mapper, and the dm-thinp kernel module. It differs by removing
the loopback device, talking straight to a raw partition (no filesystem).
a|* There are measurable performance advantages at moderate load and high density.
* It gives you per-container limits for capacity (10G by default).
a|* You have to have a dedicated partition for it.
* It is not set up by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).
* All containers and images share the same pool of capacity. It cannot be resized
without destroying and re-creating the pool.

|OverlayFS
|Combines a lower (parent) and upper (child) filesystem and a working directory
(on the same filesystem as the child). The lower filesystem is the base image,
and when you create new containers, a new upper filesystem is created
containing the deltas.
a|* Faster than Device Mapper at starting and stopping containers. The startup time
difference between Device Mapper and Overlay is generally less than one second.
* Allows for page cache sharing.
|Not POSIX compliant.

|===


For more information about OverlayFS, including supportability and usage caveats, see the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/?version=7[Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 Release Notes] for your version.

In production environments, using a Logical Volume Management (LVM) thin pool on top of regular block
devices (not loop devices) for container images and container root file system
storage is recommended.

Using a loop device can affect performance issues. While you can still
continue to use it, the following warning message is logged:

----
devmapper: Usage of loopback devices is strongly discouraged for production use.
Please use `--storage-opt dm.thinpooldev` or use `man docker` to refer to
dm.thinpooldev section.
----

To ease storage configuration, use the `docker-storage-setup` utility, which automates much of the configuration details:

. If you had a separate disk drive dedicated to Docker storage (for example,
*_/dev/xvdb_*), add the following to the *_/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup_*
file:
+
----
DEVS=/dev/xvdb
VG=docker_vg
----

. Restart the `docker-storage-setup` service:
+
----
# systemctl restart docker-storage-setup
----
+
After the restart, `docker-storage-setup` sets up a volume group named
`docker_vg` and creates a thin-pool logical volume. Documentation for thin
provisioning on RHEL is available in the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html-single/Logical_Volume_Manager_Administration/index.html[LVM
Administrator Guide]. View the newly created volumes with the `lsblk` command:
+
----
# lsblk /dev/xvdb
NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvdb 202:16 0 20G 0 disk
└─xvdb1 202:17 0 10G 0 part
  ├─docker_vg-docker--pool_tmeta 253:0 0 12M 0 lvm
  │ └─docker_vg-docker--pool 253:2 0 6.9G 0 lvm
  └─docker_vg-docker--pool_tdata 253:1 0 6.9G 0 lvm
  └─docker_vg-docker--pool 253:2 0 6.9G 0 lvm
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Thin-provisioned volumes are not mounted and have no file system (individual
containers do have an XFS file system), thus they do not show up in `df` output.
====

. To verify that Docker is using an LVM thin pool, and to monitor disk space
utilization, use the `docker info` command. The `Pool Name` corresponds with
the `VG` you specified in *_/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup_*:
+
----
# docker info | egrep -i 'storage|pool|space|filesystem'
Storage Driver: devicemapper
 Pool Name: docker_vg-docker--pool
 Pool Blocksize: 524.3 kB
 Backing Filesystem: xfs
 Data Space Used: 62.39 MB
 Data Space Total: 6.434 GB
 Data Space Available: 6.372 GB
 Metadata Space Used: 40.96 kB
 Metadata Space Total: 16.78 MB
 Metadata Space Available: 16.74 MB
----

By default, a thin pool is configured to use 40% of the underlying block device.
As you use the storage, LVM automatically extends the thin pool up to 100%. This
is why the `Data Space Total` value does not match the full size of the
underlying LVM device. This auto-extend technique was used to unify the storage
approach taken in both Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Atomic Host, which
only uses a single partition.

In development, Docker in Red Hat distributions defaults to a
loopback mounted sparse file. To see if your system is using the loopback mode:

----
# docker info|grep loop0
 Data file: /dev/loop0
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Red Hat strongly recommends using the DeviceMapper storage driver in thin-pool mode for production workloads.
====

OverlayFS is also supported for container runtimes use cases as of Red Hat Enterprise Linux
7.2, and provides faster start up time and page cache sharing, which can
potentially improve density by reducing overall memory utilization.

[[comparing-overlay-graph-drivers]]
=== Benefits of Using the OverlayFS Versus DeviceMapper with SELinux 

The main advantage of the OverlayFS graph is Linux page cache sharing among
containers that share an image on the same node. This attribute of OverlayFS leads to
reduced input/output (I/O) during container startup (and, thus, faster container
startup time by several hundred milliseconds), as well as reduced memory usage
when similar images are running on a node. Both of these results are beneficial
in many environments, especially those with the goal of optimizing for density
and have high container churn rate (such as a build farm), or those that have
significant overlap in image content.

Page cache sharing is not possible with DeviceMapper because thin-provisioned
devices are allocated on a per-container basis.

[NOTE]
====
DeviceMapper is the default Docker storage configuration on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. 
The use of OverlayFS as the container storage
technology is under evaluation and moving Red Hat Enterprise Linux to OverlayFS as
the default in future releases is under consideration.
====

[[benefits-of-using-the-overlay-graph-driver]]
=== Comparing the Overlay Versus overlay2 Graph Drivers 

OverlayFS is a type of union file system. It allows you to overlay one file system on top of another. 
Changes are recorded in the upper file system, while the lower file system remains unmodified. 
This allows multiple users to share a file-system image, such as a container or a DVD-ROM, where the base image is on read-only media. 

OverlayFS layers two directories on a single Linux host and presents them as a single directory. These directories are called layers, and the unification process is referred to as a union mount. 

OverlayFS uses one of two graph drivers, *overlay* or *overlay2*. As of Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 7.2, *overlay*  
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/7.2_release_notes/technology-preview-file_systems[became a supported graph driver]. 
As of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4, *overlay2* link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2908851[became supported]. SELinux on the docker daemon became supported in 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4. See the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/?version=7[Red Hat Enterprise Linux release notes] 
for information on using OverlayFS with your version of RHEL, including supportability and usage caveats.

The *overlay2* driver natively supports up to 128 lower OverlayFS layers but,
the *overlay* driver works only with a single lower OverlayFS layer. Because of this capability, the *overlay2* driver provides better performance 
for layer-related Docker commands, such as `docker build`, and consumes fewer inodes on the backing filesystem. 

Because the *overlay* driver works with a single lower OverlayFS layer, you cannot implement multi-layered images as multiple OverlayFS layers. 
Instead, each image layer is implemented as its own directory under *_/var/lib/docker/overlay_*. 
Hard links are then used as a space-efficient way to reference data shared with lower layers.

Docker link:https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/overlayfs-driver/[recommends] using the *overlay2* driver with OverlayFS rather than 
the *overlay* driver, because it is more efficient in terms of inode utilization.

[NOTE]
====
To use overlay2 with RHEL or CentOS you need version 3.10.0-693 or higher of the kernel.
