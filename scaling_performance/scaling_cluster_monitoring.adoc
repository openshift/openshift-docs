== Overview

{product-title} exposes metrics that can be collected and stored in back-ends by
the
link:https://github.com/openshift/cluster-monitoring-operator[*cluster-monitoring-operator*].
As an {product-title} administrator, you can view system resources, containers
and components metrics in one dashboard interface, Grafana.

This topic provides information on scaling the cluster monitoring operator.

If you want to use Prometheus with persistent storage, you must set the
`openshift_cluster_monitoring_operator_prometheus_storage_enabled` variable in
your Ansible inventory file to `true`.

[[cluster-monitoring-recommendations-for-OCP]]
== Recommendations for {product-title}

* Use at least three xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#infrastructure-nodes[infrastructure (infra)] nodes.
* Use at least three
link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift-container-storage[*openshift-container-storage*]
nodes with non-volatile memory express (NVMe) drives.
* Use persistent block storage, such as link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_container_storage/3.11/html/operations_guide/block_storage[OpenShift Container Storage (OCS) Block].

== Capacity Planning for Cluster Monitoring Operator

Various tests were performed for different scale sizes. The Prometheus database
grew, as reflected in the table below.

[NOTE]
====
The Prometheus storage requirements below are not prescriptive. Higher resource consumption might be observed in your cluster depending on workload activity and resource use.
====

.Prometheus Database storage requirements based on number of nodes/pods in the cluster
[options="header"]
|===
|Number of Nodes |Number of Pods |Prometheus storage growth per day |Prometheus storage growth per 15 days |RAM Space (per scale size) |Network (per tsdb chunk)

|50
|1800
|6.3 GB
|94 GB
|6 GB
|16 MB

|100
|3600
|13 GB
|195 GB
|10 GB
|26 MB

|150

|283 GB
|12 GB
|36 MB

|200
|7200
|25 GB
|375 GB
|14 GB
|46 MB
|===

In the above calculation, approximately 20 percent of the expected size was
added as overhead to ensure that the storage requirements do not exceed the
calculated value.

The above calculation was developed for the default {product-title}
*cluster-monitoring-operator*. For higher scale, edit the
`openshift_cluster_monitoring_operator_prometheus_storage_capacity` variable in
the Ansible inventory file, which defaults to `50Gi`.

[NOTE]
====
CPU utilization has minor impact. The ratio is approximately 1 core out of 40
per 50 nodes and 1800 pods.

[[cluster-monitoring-test-environment]]
=== Lab Environment

All experiments were performed in an {product-title} on OpenStack environment:

* Infra nodes (VMs) - 40 cores, 157 GB RAM.
* CNS nodes (VMs) - 16 cores, 62 GB RAM, NVMe drives.

[[cluster-monitoring-scaling-pods-prereqs]]
=== Prerequisites

Based on your scale destination, compute and set the relevant PV size for the Prometheus data store.
Since the default Prometheus pods replicas is 2, for 100 nodes with 3600 pods you will need 188 GB.

For example:

----
195 GB (space per 15 days ) * 2 (pods) = 390 GB free
----

Based on this equation, set
`openshift_cluster_monitoring_operator_prometheus_storage_capacity=195Gi`.
