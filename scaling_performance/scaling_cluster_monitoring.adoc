== Overview

{product-title} exposes metrics that can be collected and stored in back-ends by
the
link:https://github.com/openshift/cluster-monitoring-operator[*cluster-monitoring-operator*].
As an {product-title} administrator, you can view system resources, containers
and components metrics in one dashboard interface, Grafana.

This topic provides information on scaling the cluster monitoring operator.

[[cluster-monitoring-recommendations-for-OCP]]
== Recommendations for {product-title}

* Use at least three xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#infrastructure-nodes[infrastructure (infra)] nodes.
* Use at least three
link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift-container-storage[*openshift-container-storage*]
nodes with non-volatile memory express (NVMe) drives.
* Use persistent storage when configuring *openshift-monitoring*. Set
`openshift_cluster_monitoring_operator_prometheus_storage_enabled=true`.
* Use xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_glusterfs.adoc#overview[GlusterFS as storage] on top of NVMe drives.

[[cluster-monitoring-capacity-planning]]
== Capacity Planning for Cluster Monitoring Operator

Various tests were performed for different scale sizes. The Prometheus database
grew, as reflected in the table below.

.Prometheus Database storage requirements based on number of nodes/pods in the cluster
[options="header"]
|===
|Number of Nodes |Number of Pods |Prometheus storage growth per day |Prometheus storage growth per 15 days |RAM Space (per scale size) |Network (per tsdb chunk)

|50
|1800
|6.3 GB
|94 GB
|6 GB
|16 MB

|100
|3600
|13 GB
|195 GB
|10 GB
|26 MB

|150
|5400
|19 GB
|283 GB
|12 GB
|36 MB

|200
|7200
|25 GB
|375 GB
|14 GB
|46 MB
|===

In the above calculation, approximately 20 percent of the expected size was
added as overhead to ensure that the storage requirements do not exceed the
calculated value.

The above calculation was developed for the default {product-title}
*cluster-monitoring-operator*. For higher scale, edit the
`openshift_cluster_monitoring_operator_prometheus_storage_capacity` variable in
the Ansible inventory file, which defaults to `50Gi`.

[NOTE]
====
CPU utilization has minor impact. The ratio is approximately 1 core out of 40
per 50 nodes and 1800 pods.

[[cluster-monitoring-test-environment]]
=== Lab Environment

All experiments were performed in an {product-title} on OpenStack environment:

* Infra nodes (VMs) - 40 cores, 157 GB RAM.
* CNS nodes (VMs) - 16 cores, 62 GB RAM, NVMe drives.

[[cluster-monitoring-scaling-pods-prereqs]]
=== Prerequisites

Based on you scale destination, compute and set the relevant PV size for the Prometheus data store.
Since the default Prometheus pods replicas is 2, for 100 nodes with 3600 pods you will need 188 GB.

For example:

----
94 GB (space per 15 days ) * 2 (pods) = 188 GB free
----

Based on this equation, set
`openshift_cluster_monitoring_operator_prometheus_storage_capacity=94Gi`.

[[cluster-monitoring-scaling-pods-prometheus]]
=== Scaling the Prometheus Components

To scale up the number of {product-title} Prometheus pods replicas, run:

----
# oc scale -n openshift-monitoring --replicas=3 statefulset prometheus-k8s
----

[NOTE]
====
* The default replicas are 2 Prometheus pods.
* If you add a new node to or remove an existing node from a Prometheus cluster,
the data stored in the cluster rebalances across the cluster.
====

To scale down:

----
# oc scale -n openshift-monitoring --replicas=0 statefulset prometheus-k8s
----
