Consider the following tested cluster object maximums when you plan your {product-title} cluster.

These guidelines are based on the largest possible cluster. For smaller clusters,
the maximums are proportionally lower. There are many factors that influence the
stated thresholds, including the etcd version or storage data format.

In most cases, exceeding these numbers results in lower overall performance.
It does not necessarily mean that the cluster will fail.

== Planning Your Environment According to Cluster Maximums

[IMPORTANT]
====
Oversubscribing the physical resources on a node affects resource guarantees the
Kubernetes scheduler makes during pod placement. Learn what measures you can
take to xref:../admin_guide/overcommit.adoc#disabling-swap-memory[avoid memory swapping].

Some of the tested maximums are stretched only in a single dimension, so they might
vary when a lot of objects are running on the cluster.

The numbers noted in this documentation are based on Red Hat's test methodology,
setup, configuration, and tunings. These numbers can vary based on your own
individual setup and environments.
====

While
xref:../install/index.adoc#install-planning[planning
your environment], determine how many pods are expected to fit per node:

----
Maximum Pods per Cluster / Expected Pods per Node = Total Number of Nodes
----

The number of pods expected to fit on a node is dependent on the application
itself. Consider the application's memory, CPU, and storage requirements.

.Example Scenario

If you want to scope your cluster for 2200 pods per cluster, you would need at
least nine nodes, assuming that there are 250 maximum pods per node:

----
2200 / 250 = 8.8
----

If you increase the number of nodes to 20, then the pod distribution changes to
110 pods per node:

----
2200 / 20 = 110
----

Extrapolated requirements: 550 CPU cores, 450GB RAM, and 1.4TB storage.

Instance size for nodes can be modulated up or down, depending on your
preference. Nodes are often resource overcommitted. In this deployment
scenario, you can choose to run additional smaller nodes or fewer larger nodes
to provide the same amount of resources. Factors such as operational agility and
cost-per-instance should be considered.

Some applications lend themselves well to
xref:../admin_guide/overcommit.adoc#admin-guide-overcommit[overcommitted]
environments, and some do not. Most Java applications and applications that use
huge pages are examples of applications that would not allow for overcommitment.
That memory can not be used for other applications. In the example above, the
environment would be roughly 30 percent overcommitted, a common ratio.
