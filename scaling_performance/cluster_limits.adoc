== Overview

This topic summarizes the limits for objects in {product-title}.

In most cases, exceeding these thresholds results in lower overall performance.
It does not necessarily mean that the cluster will fail.

Some of the limits represented in this topic are given for the largest possible
cluster. For smaller clusters, the limits are proportionally lower.

There are many factors that influence the stated thresholds, including the etcd
version or storage data format.

| Number of pods per namespace footnoteref:[objectpernamespace,There are
a number of control loops in the system that need to iterate over all objects
in a given namespace as a reaction to some changes in state. Having a large
number of objects of a given type in a single namespace can make those loops
expensive and slow down processing given state changes.]

| Number of services footnoteref:[servicesandendpoints,Each service port and each service back-end has a corresponding entry in iptables. The number of back-ends of a given service impact the size of the endpoints objects, which impacts the size of data that is being sent all over the system.]

== Planning Your Environment According to Cluster Limits

[IMPORTANT]
====
Oversubscribing the physical resources on a node affects resource guarantees the
Kubernetes scheduler makes during pod placement. Learn what measures you can
take to xref:../../admin_guide/overcommit.adoc#disabling-swap-memory[avoid memory swapping].
====

While
xref:../install_config/install/planning.adoc#install-config-install-planning[planning
your environment], determine how many pods are expected to fit per node:

----
Maximum Pods per Cluster / Expected Pods per Node = Total Number of Nodes
----

The number of pods expected to fit on a node is dependent on the application
itself. Consider the application's memory, CPU, and storage requirements.

.Example Scenario

If you want to scope your cluster for 2200 pods per cluster, you would need at
least nine nodes, assuming that there are 250 maximum pods per node:

----
2200 / 250 = 8.8
----

If you increase the number of nodes to 20, then the pod distribution changes to
110 pods per node:

----
2200 / 20 = 110
----
