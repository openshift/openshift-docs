== What Cluster Loader Does

Cluster Loader is a tool that deploys large numbers of various objects to a
cluster, which creates user-defined cluster objects. Build, configure, and run
Cluster Loader to measure performance metrics of your {product-title} deployment
at various cluster states.

[[installing-cluster-loader]]
== Installing Cluster Loader

Cluster Loader is included in the *atomic-openshift-tests* package. To install
it, run:

----
$ yum install atomic-openshift-tests
----

After installation, the test executable *_extended.test_* is located in
*_/usr/libexec/atomic-openshift/extended.test_*.

[[running-cluster-loader]]
== Running Cluster Loader

. Set the `KUBECONFIG` variable to the location of the administrator `kubeconfig`:
+
----
$ export KUBECONFIG=${KUBECONFIG-$HOME/.kube/config}
----

. Execute Cluster Loader using the built-in test configuration, which deploys five
template builds and waits for them to complete:
+
----
$ cd /usr/libexec/atomic-openshift/
./extended.test --ginkgo.focus="Load cluster"
----
+
Alternatively, execute Cluster Loader with a user-defined configuration by
adding the flag for `--viper-config`:
+
----
$ ./extended.test --ginkgo.focus="Load cluster" --viper-config=config/test <1>
----
<1> In this example, there is a subdirectory called *_config/_* with a configuration
file called *_test.yml_*. In the command line, exclude the extension of the
configuration file, as the tool will automatically determine the file type and
extension.

[[configuring-cluster-loader]]
== Configuring Cluster Loader

Create multiple namespaces (projects), which contain multiple templates or pods.

Locate the configuration files for Cluster Loader in the *_config/_*
subdirectory. The pod files and template files referenced in these configuration
examples are found in the *_content/_* subdirectory.

=== Configuration Fields

.Top-level Cluster Loader Fields
|===
|Field |Description

|`cleanup`
|Set to `true` or `false`. One definition per configuration. If set to `true`,
`cleanup` will delete all namespaces (projects) created by Cluster Loader at the
end of the test.

|`projects`
|A sub-object with one or many definition(s). Under `projects`, each
namespace to create is defined and `projects` has several mandatory subheadings.

|`tuningSet`
|A sub-object with one definition per configuration. `TuningSet` allows the user
to define a tuning set to add configurable timing to project or object creation
(pods, templates, etc).
|===

.Fields under `projects`
|===
|Field |Description

|`number`
|An integer. One definition of the count of how many projects to create.

|`basename`
|A string. One definition of the base name for the project. The count of
identical namespaces will be appended to `Basename` to prevent collisions.

|`tuning`
|A string. One definition of what tuning set you want to apply to the objects,
which you deploy inside this namespace.

|`pods`
|A sub-object with one or many definition(s) of pods to deploy.

|`templates`
|A sub-object with one or many definition(s) of templates to deploy.
|===

.Fields under `pods` and `templates`
|===
|Field |Description

|`total`
|This field is not used.

|`number`
|An integer. The number of pods or templates to deploy.

|`image`
|A string. The docker image URL to a repository where it can be pulled.

|`basename`
| A string. One definition of the base name for the template (or pod) that you want to create.

|`file`
|A string. The path to a local file, which is either a PodSpec or template to be created.

|`parameters`
|Key-value pairs. Under `parameters`, you can specify a list of values to
override in the pod or template.
|===

.Fields under `tuningset`
|===
|Field |Description

|`name`
|A string. The name of the tuning set which will match the name specified when
defining a tuning in a project.

|`pods`
|A sub-object identifying the `tuningset` that will apply to pods.

|`templates`
|A sub-object identifying the `tuningset` that will apply to templates.
|===

.Fields under `tuningset` `pods` or `tuningset` `templates`
|===
|Field |Description

|`stepping`
|A sub-object. A stepping configuration used if you want to create an object in a
step creation pattern.

|`rate_limit`
|A sub-object. A rate-limiting tuning set configuration to limit the object
creation rate.
|===

.Fields under `tuningset` `pods` or `tuningset` `templates`, `stepping`
|===
|Field |Description

|`stepsize`
|An integer. How many objects to create before pausing object creation.

|`pause`
|An integer. How many seconds to pause after creating the number of objects
defined in `stepsize`.

|`timeout`
|An integer. How many seconds to wait before failure if the object creation is
not successful.

|`delay`
|An integer. How many milliseconds (ms) to wait between creation requests
|===

=== Example Cluster Loader Configuration File

Cluster Loader’s configuration file is a basic YAML file:

----
provider: local <1>
ClusterLoader:
  cleanup: true
  projects:
    - num: 1
      basename: clusterloader-cakephp-mysql
      tuning: default
      templates:
        - num: 1
          file: ./examples/quickstarts/cakephp-mysql.json

    - num: 1
      basename: clusterloader-dancer-mysql
      tuning: default
      templates:
        - num: 1
          file: ./examples/quickstarts/dancer-mysql.json

    - num: 1
      basename: clusterloader-django-postgresql
      tuning: default
      templates:
        - num: 1
          file: ./examples/quickstarts/django-postgresql.json

    - num: 1
      basename: clusterloader-nodejs-mongodb
      tuning: default
      templates:
        - num: 1
          file: ./examples/quickstarts/nodejs-mongodb.json

    - num: 1
      basename: clusterloader-rails-postgresql
      tuning: default
      templates:
        - num: 1
          file: ./examples/quickstarts/rails-postgresql.json

  tuningset: <2>
    - name: default
      pods:
        stepping: <3>
          stepsize: 5
          pause: 0 s
        rate_limit: <4>
          delay: 0 ms
----
<1> Optional setting for end-to-end tests. Set to `local` to avoid extra log messages.
<2> The tuning sets allow rate limiting and stepping, the ability to create several
batches of pods while pausing in between sets. Cluster Loader monitors
completion of the previous step before continuing.
<3> Stepping will pause for `M` seconds after each `N` objects are created.
<4> Rate limiting will wait `M` milliseconds between the creation of objects.
