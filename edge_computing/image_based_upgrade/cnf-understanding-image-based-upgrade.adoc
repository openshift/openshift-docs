= Understanding the image-based upgrade for {sno} clusters
:context: understanding-image-based-upgrade

toc::[]

From {product-title} 4.14.13, the {lcao} provides you with an alternative way to upgrade the platform version of a {sno} cluster.
The image-based upgrade is faster than the standard upgrade method and allows you to directly upgrade from {product-title} <4.y> to <4.y+2>, and <4.y.z> to <4.y.z+n>.

// Lifecycle Agent (LCAO)

This upgrade method utilizes a generated OCI image from a dedicated seed cluster that is installed on the target {sno} cluster as a new `ostree` stateroot.
A seed cluster is a {sno} cluster deployed with the target {product-title} version, Day 2 Operators, and configurations that are common to all target clusters.

You can use the seed image, which is generated from the seed cluster, to upgrade the platform version on any {sno} cluster that has the same combination of hardware, Day 2 Operators, and cluster configuration as the seed cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The image-based upgrade uses custom images that are specific to the hardware platform that the clusters are running on.
Each different hardware platform requires a separate seed image.
====

The {lcao} uses two custom resources (CRs) on the participating clusters to orchestrate the upgrade:

* On the seed cluster, the `SeedGenerator` CR allows for the seed image generation. This CR specifies the repository to push the seed image to.
* On the target cluster, the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR specifies the seed image for the upgrade of the target cluster and the backup configurations for your workloads.

.Example SeedGenerator CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: lca.openshift.io/v1
kind: SeedGenerator
metadata:
  name: seedimage
spec:
  seedImage: <seed_image>

.Example ImageBasedUpgrade CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: lca.openshift.io/v1
kind: ImageBasedUpgrade
metadata:
  name: upgrade
spec:
  stage: Idle <1>
  seedImageRef: <2>
    version: <target_version>
    image: <seed_container_image>
    pullSecretRef:
      name: <seed_pull_secret>
  autoRollbackOnFailure: {}

    namespace: openshift-lifecycle-agent
  oadpContent: <5>
  - name: oadp-cm-example
    namespace: openshift-adp
----
<1> Defines the desired stage for the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR. The value can be `Idle`, `Prep`, `Upgrade`, or `Rollback`.
<2> Defines the target platform version, the seed image to be used, and the secret required to access the image.
<3> (Optional) Specify the time frame in seconds to roll back when the upgrade does not complete within that time frame after the first reboot. If not defined or set to `0`, the default value of `1800` seconds (30 minutes) is used.
<4> (Optional) Specify the list of `ConfigMap` resources that contain your custom catalog sources to retain after the upgrade, and your extra manifests to apply to the target cluster that are not part of the seed image.
<5> Specify the list of `ConfigMap` resources that contain the {oadp-short} `Backup` and `Restore` CRs.
