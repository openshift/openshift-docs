// Lifecycle Agent (LCA)

You can use a single resource on the hub cluster, the `ImageBasedGroupUpgrade` custom resource (CR), to manage an imaged-based upgrade on a selected group of managed clusters through all stages.
{cgu-operator-first} reconciles the `ImageBasedGroupUpgrade` CR and creates the underlying resources to complete the defined stage transitions, either in a manually controlled or a fully automated upgrade flow.

For more information about the image-based upgrade, see "Understanding the image-based upgrade for single-node OpenShift clusters".
