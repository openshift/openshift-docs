= Performing an image-based upgrade for {sno} clusters using {ztp}

toc::[]

You can upgrade your managed {sno} cluster with the image-based upgrade through {ztp-first}.

When you deploy the {lcao} on a cluster, an `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR is automatically created.
You update this CR to specify the image repository of the seed image and to move through the different stages.
