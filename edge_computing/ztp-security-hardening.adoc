:FeatureName: RAN hardening for high security issues
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

Security hardening is important for protecting edge deployments. NIST SP 800-53 and CIS Kubernetes benchmarks provide the foundation for securing containerized workloads, enforcing zero trust, and ensuring regulatory compliance. To mitigate risks, safeguard critical telecommunications infrastructure, and enhance resilience at the edge, it is vital to align with these security frameworks.

The Compliance Operator running a custom telecommunications security profile, based on NIST SP 800-53 and CIS Kubernetes benchmark v1.5.0, on {product-title}, identified areas for security hardening and validated adherence to best practices. Enhancements in {product-version}, primarily implemented using ZTP manifests, are proactively implementing these critical security controls. The following sections detail the high-severity security hardening measures being implemented.
