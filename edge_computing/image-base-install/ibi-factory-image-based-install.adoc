Use the `ib-cli` CLI tool to create a live installation ISO for preinstalling {sno} on bare-metal hosts. You can extract the `ib-cli` CLI tool from the {lcao}.

The `ib-cli` CLI tool takes a seed image URL, and other inputs such as a URL for an instance of {op-system-first}, and creates a live installation ISO that references these installation artifacts. You can then restart the host using the live installation ISO to begin the preinstallation of the host. When the preinstallation is complete, the host is ready to ship to a remote site for the final site-specific configuration and deployment.

The following are the high-level steps to preinstall a {sno} cluster to a host using an image-based installation:

* Generate a seed image.
* Create a live installation ISO using the `ib-cli` CLI tool.
* Restart the host using the live installation ISO to preinstall the host.
