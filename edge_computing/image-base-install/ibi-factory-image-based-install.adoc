Use the `openshift-install` program to create a live installation ISO for preinstalling {sno} on bare-metal hosts. For more information about downloading the installation program, see "Installation process" in the "Additional resources" section.

The installation program takes a seed image URL and other inputs, such as the release version of the seed image and the disk to use for the installation process, and creates a live installation ISO. You can then start the host using the live installation ISO to begin preinstallation. When preinstallation is complete, the host is ready to ship to a remote site for the final site-specific configuration and deployment.

The following are the high-level steps to preinstall a {sno} cluster using an image-based installation:

* Generate a seed image.
* Create a live installation ISO using the installation program.
* Start the host using the live installation ISO to preinstall the host.
