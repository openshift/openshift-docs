Image-based installations streamline the deployment process for {sno} clusters by significantly reducing installation and deployment times.

This approach enables the preinstallation of configured and validated instances of {sno} on target hosts. These preinstalled hosts can be rapidly reconfigured and deployed at the far edge of the network, including in disconnected environments, with minimal intervention.

== Overview of image-based installation and deployment for {sno} clusters

Deploying infrastructure at the far edge of the network presents challenges for service providers with low bandwidth, high latency, and disconnected environments. 

It is also costly and time-consuming to install and deploy {sno} clusters.

An image-based approach to installing and deploying {sno} clusters at the far edge of the network overcomes these challenges by separating the installation and deployment stages.

Imaged-based installation::
Preinstall multiple hosts with {sno} at a central site, such as a service depot or a factory.
Then, validate the base configuration for these hosts and leverage the image-based approach to perform reproducible factory installs at scale by using a single container image.

Image-based deployment::
Ship the preinstalled and validated hosts to a remote site and rapidly reconfigure and deploy the clusters in a matter of minutes by using a configuration image.

=== Image-based installation for {sno} clusters
Using the {lcao}, you can generate an OCI container image that encapsulates an instance of a {sno} cluster. This image is derived from a dedicated cluster that you can configure with the target {product-title} version.  

You can reference this image in a live installation ISO to consistently preinstall configured and validated instances of {sno} to multiple hosts. This approach enables the preparation of hosts at a central location, for example in a factory or service depot, before shipping the preinstalled hosts to a remote site for rapid reconfiguration and deployment. 

The following is a high-level overview of the image-based installation process:

* Generate an image from a {sno} cluster.
* Use the {product-title} installation program to embed the seed image URL, and other installation artifacts, in a live installation ISO.
* Start the host using the live installation ISO to preinstall the host. 
+
During this process, the {product-title} installation program installs {op-system-first} to the disk, pulls the image you generated, and precaches release container images to the disk.

* When the installation completes, the host is ready to ship to the remote site for rapid reconfiguration and deployment.

=== Image-based deployment for {sno} clusters

You can use the {product-title} installation program to configure and deploy a host that you preinstalled with an image-based installation. To configure the target host with site-specific details, you must create the following resources:

* The `install-config.yaml` installation manifest

* The `image-based-config.yaml` manifest

The `openshift-install` program uses these resources to generate a configuration ISO that you attach to the preinstalled target host to complete the deployment.

== Image-based installation and deployment components

The following content describes the components in an image-based installation and deployment.

Seed image:: OCI container image generated from a dedicated cluster with the target {product-title} version. 

Seed cluster:: Dedicated {sno} cluster that you use to create a seed image and is deployed with the target {product-title} version.

{lcao}:: Generates the seed image, embeds the seed image URL in the live installation ISO, and reconfigures the host during remote site deployment.

`openshift-install` installation program:: Use the `openshift-install` program to manually create a configuration ISO. Attach the configuration ISO to a preinstalled host to complete the deployment.
