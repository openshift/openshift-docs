Image-based installations streamline the deployment process for {sno} clusters by significantly reducing installation and deployment times.

This approach enables the preinstallation of configured and validated instances of {sno} on target hosts. These preinstalled hosts can be rapidly reconfigured and deployed at the far edge of the network, including in disconnected environments, with minimal intervention.

== Overview of an image-based installation and deployment for {sno} clusters

Service providers continue to deploy their infrastructure at the far edge of the network. This presents challenges in low bandwidth, high latency environments, or disconnected environments, in terms of the cost, time, and expertise needed to install and deploy {sno} clusters.

An image-based approach to installing and deploying standalone {sno} clusters at the far edge of the network overcomes these challenges by separating the installation and deployment stages.

Imaged-based installation::
Using an image-based installation, you can preinstall multiple hosts with {sno} at a central site, such as a service depot or a factory. You can also validate the base configuration for these hosts and leverage the image-based approach to perform reproducible factory installs at scale by using a single container image.

Image-based deployment::
The preinstalled and validated hosts are shipped to a remote site where they can be rapidly reconfigured and deployed in a matter of minutes by using a configuration image.

=== Image-based installation for {sno} clusters
Using the {lcao}, you can generate an OCI container image that encapsulates an instance of a {sno} cluster. This image is derived from a dedicated cluster that you can configure with the target {product-title} version.  

You can reference this image in a live installation ISO to consistently preinstall configured and validated instances of {sno} to multiple hosts. This approach enables the preparation of hosts at a central location, for example in a factory or service depot, before shipping the preinstalled hosts to a remote site for rapid reconfiguration and deployment. 

The following is a high-level overview of the image-based installation process:

* Generate an image from a {sno} cluster.
* Use the {product-title} installation program to embed the seed image URL, and other installation artifacts, in a live installation ISO.
* Start the host using the live installation ISO to preinstall the host. 
+
During this process, the {product-title} installation program installs {op-system-first} to the disk, pulls the image you generated, and precaches release container images to the disk.

* When the installation completes, the host is ready to ship to the remote site for rapid reconfiguration and deployment.

=== Imaged-based deployment for standalone {sno} clusters

For standalone clusters, you can use the {product-title} installation program to configure and deploy a host that you preinstalled with an image-based installation. To configure the target host with site-specific details, you must create the following resources:
+
* The `install-config.yaml` installation manifest.

* The `image-based-config.yaml` manifest.
+
The `openshift-install` installation program consumes these resources to generate a configuration ISO that you can attach to your preinstalled target host and complete the deployment.

== Image-based installation and deployment key components

The following content describes key components in image-based installation and deployments.

Seed image:: A seed image is an OCI container image generated from a dedicated cluster with the target {product-title} version. 

Seed cluster:: A seed cluster is a dedicated {sno} cluster that you use to create a seed image and is deployed with the target {product-title} version.

{lcao}:: In image-based installations, you can use the {lcao} to generate a seed image, embed the seed image URL in a live installation ISO, and reconfigure the host during a deployment at a remote site.

Image Based Install (IBI) Operator:: When you deploy managed clusters, the IBI Operator creates a configuration ISO from the site-specific resources you define in the hub cluster, and attaches the configuration ISO to the preinstalled host by using a bare-metal provisioning service.

{product-title} installation program:: When you deploy a standalone cluster, you can use the `openshift-install` installation program to create a configuration ISO. Attach the configuration ISO to a preinstalled host to complete the deployment.
