toc::[]

With the {sco}, you can deploy clusters with all available installation methods.
The {sco} introduces a unified `ClusterInstance` API, which is derived from the `SiteConfig` API from the SiteConfig Generator kustomize plugin.
For example, the `ClusterInstance` API decouples parameters that define a cluster from the manner in which the cluster is deployed.
This separation removes certain limitations that are presented by the `SiteConfig` kustomize plugin in the current xref:../../edge_computing/ztp-deploying-far-edge-sites.adoc#ztp-deploying-far-edge-sites[{ztp-first} flow], such as agent cluster installations and scalability constraints posed by ArgoCD.
Using the unified `ClusterInstance` API, the {sco} offers the following improvements:

Isolation:: Separates cluster definition from the installation method. The `ClusterInstance` CR captures the cluster definition, while cluster templates capture the cluster architecture and installation methods.
Unification:: The {sco} unifies both Git and non-Git workflows. Users can apply the `ClusterInstance` CR directly on the hub cluster or synchronize them through a GitOps solution, like ArgoCD.
Consistency:: Maintains a consistent API across all installation methods, whether using the Assisted Installer, the Image Based Install Operator, or any other custom template-based approach.
Scalability:: Achieves greater scalability per cluster than the `SiteConfig` kustomize plugin.
Flexibility:: Provides users with more power to deploy and install clusters by using custom cluster templates.
Troubleshooting:: Offers insightful information regarding cluster deployment status and rendered manifests, significantly enhancing the troubleshooting experience.
