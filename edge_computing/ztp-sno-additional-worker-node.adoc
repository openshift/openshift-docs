= Expanding {sno} clusters with {ztp}

toc::[]

You can expand {sno} clusters with {ztp-first}. When you add worker nodes to {sno} clusters, the original {sno} cluster retains the control plane node role. Adding worker nodes does not require any downtime for the existing {sno} cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Although there is no specified limit on the number of worker nodes that you can add to a {sno} cluster, you must revaluate the reserved CPU allocation on the control plane node for the additional worker nodes.
====

If you require workload partitioning on the worker node, you must deploy and remediate the managed cluster policies on the hub cluster before installing the node. This way, the workload partitioning `MachineConfig` objects are rendered and associated with the `worker` machine config pool before the {ztp} workflow applies the `MachineConfig` ignition file to the worker node.

It is recommended that you first remediate the policies, and then install the worker node.
If you create the workload partitioning manifests after installing the worker node, you must drain the node manually and delete all the pods managed by daemon sets. When the managing daemon sets create the new pods, the new pods undergo the workload partitioning process.
