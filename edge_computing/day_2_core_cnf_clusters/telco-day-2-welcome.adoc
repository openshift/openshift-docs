You can use the following Day 2 operations to manage {product-title} clusters.

Updating an {product-title} cluster:: Updating your cluster is a critical task that ensures that bugs and potential security vulnerabilities are patched.
For more information, see xref:../day_2_core_cnf_clusters/updating/update-welcome.adoc#update-welcome[Updating an {product-title} cluster].

Troubleshooting and maintaining telco core CNF clusters:: To maintain and troubleshoot a bare-metal environment where high-bandwidth network throughput is required, see xref:../day_2_core_cnf_clusters/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-intro.adoc#troubleshooting-intro[Troubleshooting and maintaining {product-title} clusters].

Observability in {product-title} clusters:: {product-title} generates a large amount of data, such as performance metrics and logs from the platform and the workloads running on it.
As an administrator, you can use tools to collect and analyze the available data.
For more information, see xref:../day_2_core_cnf_clusters/observability/observability.adoc#observability[Observability in {product-title}].
