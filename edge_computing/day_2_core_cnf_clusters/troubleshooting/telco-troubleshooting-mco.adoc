The Machine Config Operator provides useful information to cluster administrators and controls what is running directly on the bare-metal host.

The Machine Config Operator differentiates between different groups of nodes in the cluster, allowing control plane nodes and worker nodes to run with different configurations.
These groups of nodes run worker or application pods, which are called `MachineConfigPool` (`mcp`) groups.
The same machine config is applied on all nodes or only on one MCP in the cluster.

For more information about how and why to apply MCPs in a telco core cluster, see xref:../../../edge_computing/day_2_core_cnf_clusters/updating/telco-update-ocp-update-prep.adoc#telco-update-applying-mcp-labels-to-nodes-before-the-update_ocp-update-prep[Applying MachineConfigPool labels to nodes before the update].
