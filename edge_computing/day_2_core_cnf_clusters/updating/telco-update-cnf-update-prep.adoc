Follow the guidance in link:https://redhat-best-practices-for-k8s.github.io/guide/[Red Hat best practices for Kubernetes] when developing cloud-native network functions (CNFs) to ensure that the cluster can schedule pods during an update.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Always deploy pods in groups by using `Deployment` resources.
`Deployment` resources spread the workload across all of the available pods ensuring there is no single point of failure.
When a pod that is managed by a `Deployment` resource is deleted, a new pod takes its place automatically.
