Fair sharing is a preemption strategy that is used to achieve an equal or weighted share of borrowable resources between the tenants of a cohort. Borrowable resources are the unused nominal quota of all the cluster queues in a cohort.

You can configure fair sharing by setting the `preemptionPolicy` value in the `Kueue` custom resource (CR) to `FairSharing`.
