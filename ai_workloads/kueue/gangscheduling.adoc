Gang scheduling ensures that a group or _gang_ of related jobs only start when all required resources are available. {kueue-name} enables gang scheduling by suspending jobs until the {product-title} cluster can guarantee the capacity to start and execute all of the related jobs in the gang together. This is also known as _all-or-nothing_ scheduling.

Gang scheduling is important if you are working with expensive, limited resources, such as GPUs. Gang scheduling can prevent jobs from claiming but not using GPUs, which can improve GPU utilization and can reduce running costs. Gang scheduling can also help to prevent issues like resource segmentation and deadlocking.

// use case - deep learning
One classic example is in deep learning workloads. Deep learning frameworks (Tensorflow, PyTorch etc) require all the workers to be running during the training process.

In this scenario, when you deploy training workloads, all the components should be scheduled and deployed to ensure the training works as expected.

Gang Scheduling is a critical feature for Deep Learning workloads to enable all-or-nothing scheduling capability, as most DL frameworks requires all workers to be running to start training process. Gang Scheduling avoids resource inefficiency and scheduling deadlock sometimes.
