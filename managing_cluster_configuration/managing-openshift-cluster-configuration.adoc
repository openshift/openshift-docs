= Managing {OCP} cluster configuration

:context: managing-openshift-cluster-configuration

toc::[]

As an administrator, maintaining the stability and consistency of an OpenShift {OCP} environment requires a move away from traditionally manual configurations toward automated, declarative management. {gitops-title} enables you to use Git repositories as the foundation for your infrastructure and application definitions. With {gitops-title}, you can manage your {OCP} cluster configuration to have the following benefits:

* Version control and auditability: Configuration changes committed to Git provide a complete history of modifications. This facilitates auditing, compliance, and accountability.
* Single source of truth: Git serves as the definitive source for the desired state of your {OCP} cluster.
* Optimized performance and disaster recovery: {gitops-shortname} points the Argo CD application to the previous commit or tag with a known-good state in Git, which in turn reduces downtime and helps with disaster recovery.
* Collaboration and Review: Git's collaborative features enable team members to review and approve infrastructure and application configuration changes before they are applied to your {OCP} cluster.
* Efficiency and Scalability: {gitops-shortname} streamlines the deployment and operations workflows, enabling efficient management of complex and multi-cluster environments with reduced manual intervention and human error.

Perform the following tasks to manage your {OCP} cluster configuration:

. Installing the {gitops-title} Operator using CLI
. Analyzing the default Argo CD instance
. Accessing the default Argo CD instance
. Configuring the default Argo CD instance
