toc::[]

The Telco RAN reference design specification captures the recommended, tested, and supported configurations to get reliable and repeatable performance for a cluster running the telco RAN DU profile.

These configurations are updated for each major Y-stream release of {product-title}.
Z-stream patch releases are periodically re-tested against this reference configuration including many long duration validations.
