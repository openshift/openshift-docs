*openshift/okd* project repository for information on the latest OKD releases.

[id="ocp-operators"]
== Operators

xref:../operators/understanding/olm-what-operators-are.adoc#olm-what-operators-are[Operators]
are pieces of software that ease the operational complexity of running another
piece of software. They act like an extension of the software vendorâ€™s
engineering team, watching over a Kubernetes environment (such as
{product-title}) and using its current state to make decisions in real time.
Advanced Operators are designed to handle upgrades seamlessly, react to failures
automatically, and not take shortcuts, like skipping a software backup process
to save time.

[id="ocp-operator-lifecycle-manager"]
=== Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

This feature is now fully supported in OpenShift v4.

The OLM aids cluster administrators in installing, upgrading, and granting
access to Operators running on their cluster:

* Includes a catalog of curated Operators, with the ability to load other Operators into the cluster
* Handles rolling updates of all Operators to new versions
* Supports role-based access control (RBAC) for certain teams to use certain Operators

See
xref:../operators/understanding/olm/olm-understanding-olm.adoc#olm-understanding-olm[Understanding the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)] for more information.

[id="ocp-installation-and-upgrade"]
== Installation and upgrade

Red Hat OpenShift v4 has an installer-provisioned infrastructure, where
the installation program controls all areas of the installation process.
Installer-provisioned infrastructure also provides an opinionated best practices
deployment of OpenShift v4 for AWS instances only. This provides a
slimmer default installation, with incremental feature buy-in through
OperatorHub.

You can also install with a user-provided infrastructure on
AWS, bare metal, or vSphere hosts. If you use the installer-provisioned
infrastructure installation, the cluster provisions and manages all of the
cluster infrastructure for you.

Upgrading from 3.x to 4 is currently not available. You must perform a new
installation of OpenShift v4.

Easy, over-the-air upgrades for asynchronous z-stream releases of
OpenShift v4 is available. Cluster administrators can upgrade using the
*Cluster Settings* tab in the web console.
See
xref:../updating/updating-cluster.adoc#updating-cluster[Updating a cluster]
for more information.

[id="ocp-operator-hub"]
=== OperatorHub

OperatorHub is available to administrators and helps with easy discovery and
installation of all optional components and applications. It includes offerings
from Red Hat products, Red Hat partners, and the community.

[id="ocp-storage"]
== Storage

Storage support in OpenShift v4 is the same as OpenShift v3 with
the exception of the following available in Technology Preview: EFS (CSI Driver
handled via Amazon), Manila provisioner/operator, and Snapshot.

[id="ocp-scale"]
== Scale

[id="ocp-scale-cluster-limits"]
=== Cluster maximums

Updated guidance around
xref:../scalability_and_performance/planning-your-environment-according-to-object-maximums.adoc#planning-your-environment-according-to-object-maximums[Cluster
maximums] for OpenShift v4 is now available.

Use the link:https://access.redhat.com/labs/ocplimitscalculator/[{product-title}
Limit Calculator] to estimate cluster limits for your environment.

[id="ocp-node-tuning-operator"]
=== Node Tuning Operator

The
xref:../scalability_and_performance/using-node-tuning-operator.adoc#using-node-tuning-operator[Node
Tuning Operator] is now part of a standard {product-title} installation in
OpenShift v4.

The Node Tuning Operator helps you manage node-level tuning by orchestrating the
tuned daemon. The majority of high-performance applications require some level
of kernel tuning. The Node Tuning Operator provides a unified management
interface to users of node-level sysctls and more flexibility to add custom
tuning, which is currently a Technology Preview feature, specified by user
needs. The Operator manages the containerized tuned daemon for OpenShift
Container Platform as a Kubernetes DaemonSet. It ensures the custom tuning
specification is passed to all containerized tuned daemons running in the
cluster in the format that the daemons understand. The daemons run on all nodes
in the cluster, one per node.

[id="ocp-cluster-monitoring"]
== Cluster monitoring

[id="ocp-autoscale-pods-horizontally-based-on-custom-metrics-api"]
=== Autoscale pods horizontally based on the custom metrics API (Technology Preview)

This feature, currently in Technology Preview, enables you to configure
horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) based on the custom metrics API. As part of
this Technology Preview, a Prometheus Adapter component can be deployed to
provide any app metrics for the custom metrics API.

Limitations:

* The adapter only connects to a single Prometheus instance (or a set of
load-balanced replicas, using Kubernetes services).
* Manually deploying adapter and configuring it to use Prometheus.
* Syntax for the Prometheus Adapter configuration could change in the future.
* The `APIService` configuration to wire Kubernetes' API aggregation to the
instance of the custom metrics adapter will be overwritten in future releases,
if {product-title} ships an out-of-the-box custom metrics adapter.

[id="ocp-cluster-monitoring-alerting-UI"]
=== New alerting user interface

An alerting UI is now natively integrated into the {product-title} web console.
You can now view cluster-level alerts and alerting rules from a single place, as
well as configure silences.

[id="ocp-cluster-monitoring-telemeter"]
=== Telemeter

Telemeter collects anonymized cluster-related metrics to proactively help
customers with their {product-title} clusters. This helps:

* Gather crucial health metrics of {product-title} installations.
* Enable a viable feedback loop of {product-title} upgrades.
* Gather the cluster's number of nodes per cluster and their size (CPU cores and
RAM).
* Gather the size of etcd.
* Gather details about the health condition and status for any OpenShift framework
component installed on an OpenShift cluster.

[id="ocp-cluster-monitoring-autoscale"]
=== Autoscale pods horizontally based on the resource metrics API

By default, OpenShift Cluster Monitoring exposes CPU and Memory utilization
through the Kubernetes resource metrics API. There is no longer a requirement to
install a separate metrics server.

[id="ocp-developer-experience"]
== Developer experience

[id="ocp-multistage-builds"]
=== Multi-stage Dockerfile Builds Generally Available

Multi-stage Dockerfiles are now supported in all `Docker` strategy builds.

[id="ocp-registry"]
== Registry

[id="ocp-registry-managed-by-operator"]
=== The registry is now managed by an Operator

The registry is now managed by an Operator instead of `oc adm registry`.

[id="ocp-networking"]
== Networking

[id="ocp-cno"]
=== Cluster Network Operator (CNO)

The cluster network is now configured and managed by an Operator. The Operator
upgrades and monitors the cluster network.

[id="ocp-openshift-sdn"]
=== OpenShift SDN

The default mode is now `NetworkPolicy`.

[id="ocp-multus"]
=== Multus

Multus is a meta plug-in for Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI), which
enables a user to create multiple network interfaces per pod.

[id="ocp-sriov"]
=== SR-IOV

OpenShift v4 includes the Technical Preview capability to use specific
SR-IOV hardware on {product-title} nodes, which enables the user to
attach SR-IOV virtual function (VF) interfaces to Pods in addition to other
network interfaces.

[id="ocp-f5"]
=== F5 router plug-in support

F5 router plug-in is no longer supported as part of {product-title} directly.
However, F5 has developed a container connector that replaces the functionality.
It is recommended to work with F5 support to implement their solution.

[id="ocp-web-console"]
== Web console

[id="ocp-developer-catalog"]
=== Developer Catalog

OpenShift v4 features a redesigned Developer Catalog that brings all of
the new Operators and existing broker services together, with new ways to
discover, sort, and understand how to best use each type of offering. The
Developer Catalog is the entry point for a developer to access all services
available to them. It merges all capabilities from Operators, the Service
Catalog, brokers, and Source-to-Image (S2I).

[id="ocp-new-management-screens"]
=== New management screens

New management screens in OpenShift v4 support automated operations.
Examples include the management of machine sets and machines, taints,
tolerations, and cluster settings.

[id="ocp-security"]
== Security

In OpenShift v4, Operators are utilized to install, configure, and
manage the various certificate signing servers. Certificates are managed
as secrets stored within the cluster itself.
