Before adding Windows workloads to your cluster, you must install the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO), which is available in the {product-title} OperatorHub. The WMCO orchestrates the process of deploying and managing Windows workloads on a cluster.

[discrete]
== Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have installed your cluster using installer-provisioned infrastructure. Clusters installed with user-provisioned infrastructure are not supported for Windows container workloads.

* You have configured hybrid networking with OVN-Kubernetes for your cluster. This must be completed during the installation of your cluster. For more information, see xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/configuring-hybrid-networking.adoc#configuring-hybrid-ovnkubernetes[Configuring hybrid networking].

* You are running an {product-title} cluster version 4.6.8 or later.
