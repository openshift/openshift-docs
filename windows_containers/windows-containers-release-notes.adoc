== About Windows Container Support for Red Hat OpenShift

Windows Container Support for Red Hat OpenShift is a feature providing the ability to run Windows compute nodes in an {product-title} cluster. This is possible by using the Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) to install and manage Windows nodes. With Windows nodes available, you can run Windows container workloads in {product-title}.

The release notes for Red Hat OpenShift for Windows Containers tracks the development of the WMCO, which provides all Windows container workload capabilities in {product-title}.

== Getting support

You must have a subscription to receive support for the Red Hat WMCO. Deploying Windows container workloads in production clusters is not supported without a subscription. If you do not have a subscription, you can use the community WMCO, a distribution that lacks official support. Request support through the link:http://access.redhat.com/[Red Hat Customer Portal].

=== Bug fixes

* Previously, if you had a cluster with two Windows nodes, and you created a web server deployment with two replicas, the pods would each land on a Windows compute node. In this scenario, if you created a `Service` object with type `LoadBalancer`, communication with the load balancer endpoint was flaky. To mitigate this issue, you were required to use Windows Server 2019 with a version 10.0.17763.1457 or earlier. This issue has been fixed, and you are no longer restricted to a subset of Windows Server 2019 image versions. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1942630[*BZ#1942630*])
