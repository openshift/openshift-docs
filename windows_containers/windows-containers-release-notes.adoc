== About Windows Container Support for Red Hat OpenShift

Windows Container Support for Red Hat OpenShift is a feature providing the ability to run Windows compute nodes in an {product-title} cluster. This is possible by using the Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) to install and manage Windows nodes. With Windows nodes available, you can run Windows container workloads in {product-title}.

The release notes for Red Hat OpenShift for Windows Containers tracks the development of the WMCO, which provides all Windows container workload capabilities in {product-title}.

== Getting support

You must have a subscription to receive support for the Red Hat WMCO. Deploying Windows container workloads in production clusters is not supported without a subscription. If you do not have a subscription, you can use the community WMCO, a distribution that lacks official support. Request support through the link:http://access.redhat.com/[Red Hat Customer Portal].

== Release notes for Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator 1.0.3

The WMCO 1.0.3 is now available with bug fixes and security updates. The components of the WMCO were released in link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2021:0410[RHBA-2021:0410].

[id="wmco-1-0-2"]
== Release notes for Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator 1.0.2

This release of the WMCO provides initial support for running Windows compute nodes in an {product-title} cluster. The components of the WMCO were released in link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2020:5596[RHBA-2020:5596].

WMCO supports self-managed clusters built using installer-provisioned infrastructure running on the following cloud providers:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Microsoft Azure

The following Windows Server operating systems are supported in the initial release of the WMCO:

* Windows Server Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC): Windows Server 2019

[id="wmco-1-0-1-known-issues"]
=== Known issues

* If you have a cluster with two Windows nodes, and you create a web server deployment with two replicas, the pods each land on a Windows compute node. In this scenario, if you create a `Service` object with type `LoadBalancer`, communication with the load balancer endpoint is flaky. To mitigate this issue, you must use Windows Server 2019 with a version 10.0.17763.1457 or earlier. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1905950[*BZ#1905950*])

    --query 'Images[*].[ImageId]' \
    --output=json | jq .[0][0]
----
<1> Specify the region your cluster is using.

----
<1> Specify the location your cluster is using.

. Find a `WindowsServer` image offering that defines the `2019-Datacenter-with-Containers` SKU with version `17763.1457.2009030514` or earlier.
