== About Windows Container Support for Red Hat OpenShift

{productwinc} is a feature providing the ability to run Windows compute nodes in an {product-title} cluster. This is possible by using the Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) to install and manage Windows nodes. With Windows nodes available, you can run Windows container workloads in {product-title}.

The release notes for {productwinc} tracks the development of the WMCO, which provides all Windows container workload capabilities in {product-title}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because link:https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/containers/important-update-deprecation-of-docker-virtual-machine-images/ba-p/3646272[Microsoft has stopped publishing Windows Server 2019 images with Docker], Red Hat no longer supports Windows Azure for WMCO releases older than version 6.0.0. For WMCO 5.y.z and earlier, Windows Server 2019 images must have Docker pre-installed. WMCO 6.0.0 and later uses containerd as the runtime. You can upgrade to {product-title} 4.11, which uses WMCO 6.0.0.

== Getting support

// wording taken and modified from https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#windows

Windows Container Support for Red Hat OpenShift is provided and available as an optional, installable component. Windows Container Support for Red Hat OpenShift is not part of the {product-title} subscription. It requires an additional Red Hat subscription and is supported according to the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/production/soc/[Scope of coverage] and link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/production/sla[Service level agreements].

You must have this separate subscription to receive support for Windows Container Support for Red Hat OpenShift. Without this additional Red Hat subscription, deploying Windows container workloads in production clusters is not supported. You can request support through the link:http://access.redhat.com/[Red Hat Customer Portal]. 

For more information, see the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy document for link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#windows[Red Hat OpenShift support for Windows Containers].

If you do not have this additional Red Hat subscription, you can use the Community Windows Machine Config Operator, a distribution that lacks official support.

=== Bug fixes

* Previously, if you had a cluster with two Windows nodes, and you created a web server deployment with two replicas, the pods would each land on a Windows compute node. In this scenario, if you created a `Service` object with type `LoadBalancer`, communication with the load balancer endpoint was flaky. To mitigate this issue, you were required to use Windows Server 2019 with a version 10.0.17763.1457 or earlier. This issue has been fixed, and you are no longer restricted to a subset of Windows Server 2019 image versions. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1942630[*BZ#1942630*])
