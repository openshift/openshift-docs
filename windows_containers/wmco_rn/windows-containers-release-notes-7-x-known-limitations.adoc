Note the following limitations when working with Windows nodes managed by the WMCO (Windows nodes).

* The following {product-title} features are not supported on Windows nodes:
// ** Red Hat OpenShift Developer CLI (odo)
** Image builds
** OpenShift Pipelines
** OpenShift Service Mesh
** OpenShift monitoring of user-defined projects
** {ServerlessProductName}
** Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
** Vertical Pod Autoscaling
** Hosted Control Planes

* The following Red Hat features are not supported on Windows nodes:
** link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/cost_management_service/1-latest[Red Hat Insights cost management]
** link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-local/overview[Red Hat OpenShift Local]

* Dual NIC is not supported on WMCO-managed Windows instances.

* Windows nodes do not support workloads created by using deployment configs. You can use a deployment or other method to deploy workloads.

* Windows nodes are not supported in clusters that use a cluster-wide proxy. This is because the WMCO is not able to route traffic through the proxy connection for the workloads.

* Windows nodes are not supported in clusters that are in a disconnected environment.

* {productwinc} does not support adding Windows nodes to a cluster through a trunk port. The only supported networking configuration for adding Windows nodes is through an access port that carries traffic for the VLAN.

* {productwinc} supports only in-tree storage drivers for all cloud providers.

* {productwinc} does not support any Windows operating system language other than English (United States). 

* Due to a limitation within the Windows operating system, `clusterNetwork` CIDR addresses of class E, such as `240.0.0.0`, are not compatible with Windows nodes.

* Kubernetes has identified the following link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/windows/intro/#limitations[node feature limitations] :
** Huge pages are not supported for Windows containers.
** Privileged containers are not supported for Windows containers.

* Kubernetes has identified link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/windows/intro/#api[several API compatibility issues].
