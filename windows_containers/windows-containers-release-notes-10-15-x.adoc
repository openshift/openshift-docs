[id="about-windows-containers"]
== About {productwinc}

Windows Container Support for Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift enables running Windows compute nodes in an {product-title} cluster. Running Windows workloads is possible by using the Red{nbsp}Hat Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) to install and manage Windows nodes. With Windows nodes available, you can run Windows container workloads in {product-title}.

The release notes for Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift for Windows Containers tracks the development of the WMCO, which provides all Windows container workload capabilities in {product-title}.

== Getting support

// wording taken and modified from https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#windows

Windows Container Support for Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift is provided and available as an optional, installable component. Windows Container Support for Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift is not part of the {product-title} subscription. It requires an additional Red{nbsp}Hat subscription and is supported according to the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/production/soc/[Scope of coverage] and link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/production/sla[Service level agreements].

You must have this separate subscription to receive support for Windows Container Support for Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift. Without this additional Red{nbsp}Hat subscription, deploying Windows container workloads in production clusters is not supported. You can request support through the link:http://access.redhat.com/[Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal].

For more information, see the Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy document for link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#windows[{productwinc}].

If you do not have this additional Red{nbsp}Hat subscription, you can use the Community Windows Machine Config Operator, a distribution that lacks official support.

=== Bug fixes

// Copied from 4.16 release notes. 
* Previously, because of a missing DNS suffix in the kubelet host name on instances that are part of a Windows AD domain controller, the cloud provider failed to find VMs by name. With this fix, the DNS suffix is now included in the host name resolution. As a result, the WMCO is able to configure and join Windows instances that are part of AD domain controller. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=33319[*BZ-33319*])

// Copied from 4.16 release notes. 
* Previously, if reverse DNS lookup failed due to an error, such as the reverse DNS lookup services being unavailable, the WMCO would not fall back to using the VM hostname to determine if a certificate signing requests (CSR) should be approved. As a consequence, Bring-Your-Own-Host (BYOH) Windows nodes configured with an IP address would not become available. With this fix, BYOH nodes are properly added if reverse DNS is not available. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=36643[*BZ-36643*])

// Copied from 4.16 release notes. 
* Previously, if there were multiple service account token secrets in the WMCO namespace, scaling Windows nodes would fail. With this fix, the WMCO uses only the secret it creates, ignoring any other service account token secrets in the WMCO namespace. As a result, Windows nodes scale properly. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=29253[*BZ-29253*])

* Previously, if a Windows VM had its PowerShell `ExecutionPolicy` set to `Restricted`, the Windows Instance Config Daemon (WICD) could not run the commands on that VM that are necessary for creating Windows nodes. With this fix, the WICD now bypasses the execution policy on the VM when running PowerShell commands. As a result, the WICD can create Windows nodes on the VM as expected.
