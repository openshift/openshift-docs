You can create a Windows `MachineSet` object to serve a specific purpose in your {product-title} cluster on Microsoft Azure. For example, you might create infrastructure Windows machine sets and related machines so that you can move supporting Windows workloads to the new Windows machines.

[discrete]
== Prerequisites

* You installed the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).
* You are using a supported Windows Server as the operating system image with the Docker-formatted container runtime add-on enabled.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, the Docker-formatted container runtime is used in Windows nodes. Kubernetes is deprecating Docker as a container runtime; you can reference the Kubernetes documentation for more information in link:https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/02/dont-panic-kubernetes-and-docker/[Docker deprecation]. Containerd will be the new supported container runtime for Windows nodes in a future release of Kubernetes.
