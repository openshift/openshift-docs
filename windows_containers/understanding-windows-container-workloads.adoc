Windows Container Support for Red Hat OpenShift provides built-in support for running Microsoft Windows Server containers on {product-title}. For those that administer heterogeneous environments with a mix of Linux and Windows workloads, {product-title} allows you to deploy Windows workloads running on Windows Server containers while also providing traditional Linux workloads hosted on {op-system-first} or {op-system-base-full}.

Windows container workloads are supported for clusters running on the following cloud providers:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Microsoft Azure
//* VMware vSphere

The following Windows Server operating systems are supported for {product-title} {product-version}:

* Windows Server Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC): Windows Server 2019

For more information, see Microsoft's documentation on link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started-19/servicing-channels-19[Windows Server channels].

[NOTE]
====
Multi-tenancy for clusters that have Windows nodes is not supported. Hostile multi-tenant usage introduces security concerns in all Kubernetes environments. Additional security features like link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/[pod security policies], or more fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC) for nodes, make exploits more difficult. However, if you choose to run hostile multi-tenant workloads, a hypervisor is the only security option you should use. The security domain for Kubernetes encompasses the entire cluster, not an individual node. For these types of hostile multi-tenant workloads, you should use physically isolated clusters.

Windows Server Containers provide resource isolation using a shared kernel but are not intended to be used in hostile multitenancy scenarios. Scenarios that involve hostile multitenancy should use Hyper-V Isolated Containers to strongly isolate tenants.
