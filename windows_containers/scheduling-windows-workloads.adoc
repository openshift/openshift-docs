You can schedule Windows workloads to Windows compute nodes.

[NOTE]
====
The WMCO is not supported in clusters that use a xref:../networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy.adoc#enable-cluster-wide-proxy[cluster-wide proxy] because the WMCO is not able to route traffic through the proxy connection for the workloads.
