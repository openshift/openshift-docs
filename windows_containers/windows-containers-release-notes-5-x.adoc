== About {productwinc}

{productwinc} enables running Windows compute nodes in an {product-title} cluster. Running Windows workloads is possible by using the Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) to install and manage Windows nodes. With Windows nodes available, you can run Windows container workloads in {product-title}.

The release notes for {productwinc} tracks the development of the WMCO, which provides all Windows container workload capabilities in {product-title}.

Version 5.x of the WMCO is compatible only with {product-title} 4.10.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because link:https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/containers/important-update-deprecation-of-docker-virtual-machine-images/ba-p/3646272[Microsoft has stopped publishing Windows Server 2019 images with
Docker], Red Hat no longer supports Windows Azure for WMCO releases earlier than version 6.0.0. For WMCO 5.y.z and earlier, Windows Server 2019 images must have Docker pre-installed. WMCO 6.0.0 and later uses containerd as the runtime. You can upgrade to {product-title} 4.11, which uses WMCO 6.0.0.

== Getting support

// wording taken and modified from https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#windows

{productwinc} is provided and available as an optional, installable component. Windows Container Support for Red Hat OpenShift is not part of the {product-title} subscription. It requires an additional Red Hat subscription and is supported according to the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/production/soc/[Scope of coverage] and link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/production/sla[Service level agreements].

You must have this separate subscription to receive support for Windows Container Support for Red Hat OpenShift. Without this additional Red Hat subscription, deploying Windows container workloads in production clusters is not supported. You can request support through the link:http://access.redhat.com/[Red Hat Customer Portal].

For more information, see the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy document for link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#windows[{productwinc}].

If you do not have this additional Red Hat subscription, you can use the Community Windows Machine Config Operator, a distribution that lacks official support.

[id="wmco-5-1-0"]
== Release notes for Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator 5.1.0

This release of the WMCO is now available with a bug fix and a few improvements. The components of the WMCO 5.1.0 is now available in link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2022:4989[RHBA-2022:4989-01].

=== Bug fix

Previously, the reverse DNS lookup of Windows Bring-Your-Own-Host (BYOH) instances failed when the node's external IP was present without pointer records (PTR). With this release, the WMCO looks in the other node addresses until a reverse lookup record is found, if the PTR record is not present in the first node IP address. As a result, the reverse configuration of Windows BYOH instances succeed when the node external IP address is present without a PTR record.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2081825[**BZ#2081825**])

=== Known Issue

Windows machine sets cannot scale up when the `publicIP` parameter is set to `false` in `machineSets` on Microsoft Azure. This issue is tracked by (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2091642[**BZ#2091642**]).

=== New features and improvements
[id="wmco-5-1.0-node-certificates"]
==== Windows node certificates are updated

With this release, the WMCO updates the Windows node certificates when the kubelet client certificate authority (CA) certificate rotates.

==== Windows Server 2022 support

With this release, Windows Server 2022 now supports VMware vSphere and Bare metal.

== Release notes for Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator 5.0.0

This release of the WMCO provides bug fixes for running Windows compute nodes in an {product-title} cluster. The components of the WMCO 5.0.0 were released in link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:0577[RHSA-2022:0577].

* Previously, Windows Containers on Windows Nodes could get assigned an incorrect DNS server IP. This caused DNS resolution to fail. This fix removes the hard-coded cluster DNS information and the DNS server IP is now passed as a command-line argument. As a result, Windows Containers on Windows Nodes get assigned a valid DNS Server IP and DNS resolution works for Windows workloads. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1994859[**BZ#1994859**])

* Previously, certain commands being run by the WMCO against Windows VMs that used PowerShell as the default SSH shell were not parsed correctly. As a result, these VMs could not be added to a cluster as a node. With this fix the WMCO identifies the default SSH shell of a VM and runs commands accordingly. As a result, VMs with PowerShell as the default SSH shell can now be added to the cluster as a node. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2000772[**BZ#2000772**])

* Previously, if a Bring-Your-Own-Host (BYOH) VM was specified with a DNS object, the WMCO was not properly associating the VM with its node object. This caused the WMCO to attempt to configure VMs that were already fully configured. With this fix the WMCO correctly resolves the DNS address of the VMs when looking for an associated node. As a result, BYOH VMs are now only configured when needed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2005360[**BZ#2005360**])

* Previously, if the `windows-exporter` metrics endpoint object contained a reference to a deleted machine, the WMCO ignored `Deleting` phase notification event for  those machines. This fix removes the validation of the machine object from event filtering. As a result, the `windows-exporter` metrics endpoint object is correctly updated even when the machine is still deleting. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2008601[**BZ#2008601**])

* Previously, if an entity other than the WMCO modified the certificate signing request (CSR) associated with a BYOH node, the WMCO would have a stale reference to the CSR and would be unable to approve it. With this fix, if an update conflict is detected, the WMCO retries the CSR approval until a specified timeout. As a result, the CSR processing completes as expected.
