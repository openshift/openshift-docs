Windows Container Support for OpenShift is a feature providing the ability to run Windows compute nodes in an {product-title} cluster. This is possible by using the Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) to install and manage Windows nodes. With a Red Hat subscription, you can get support for running Windows workloads in {product-title}. For more information, see the xref:../windows_containers/windows-containers-release-notes-4-x.adoc#windows-containers-release-notes-4-x[release notes].

For workloads including both Linux and Windows, {product-title} allows you to deploy Windows workloads running on Windows Server containers while also providing traditional Linux workloads hosted on {op-system-first} or {op-system-base-full}. For more information, see xref:../windows_containers/understanding-windows-container-workloads.adoc#understanding-windows-container-workloads[getting started with Windows container workloads].

You need a WMCO to run Windows workloads in your cluster. The WMCO orchestrates the process of deploying and managing Windows workloads on a cluster. For more information, see xref:../windows_containers/enabling-windows-container-workloads.adoc#enabling-windows-container-workloads[how to enable Windows container workloads].

You can create a Windows `MachineSet` object to create infrastructure Windows machine sets and related machines so that you can move supporting Windows workloads to the new Windows machines. You can create a Windows `MachineSet` object on multiple platforms.

You can xref:../windows_containers/scheduling-windows-workloads.adoc#scheduling-windows-workloads[schedule Windows workloads] to Windows compute nodes.

You can xref:../windows_containers/windows-node-upgrades.adoc#windows-node-upgrades[perform Windows Machine Config Operator upgrades] to ensure that your Windows nodes have the latest updates.

You can xref:../windows_containers/byoh-windows-instance.adoc#byoh-windows-instance[use Bring-Your-Own-Host (BYOH) Windows instances] to repurpose Windows Server VMs and bring them to {product-title}. BYOH Windows instances benefit users looking to mitigate major disruptions in the event that a Windows server goes offline. You can use BYOH Windows instances as nodes on {product-title} 4.8 and later versions.

You can xref:../windows_containers/disabling-windows-container-workloads.adoc#disabling-windows-container-workloads[disable Windows container workloads] by performing the following:

* Uninstalling the Windows Machine Config Operator
* Deleting the Windows Machine Config Operator namespace
