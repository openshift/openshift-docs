== About Windows Container Support for Red Hat OpenShift

Windows Container Support for Red Hat OpenShift enables running Windows compute nodes in an {product-title} cluster. This is possible by using the Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) to install and manage Windows nodes. With Windows nodes available, you can run Windows container workloads in {product-title}.

The release notes for Red Hat OpenShift for Windows Containers tracks the development of the WMCO, which provides all Windows container workload capabilities in {product-title}.

== Getting support

You must have a subscription to receive support for the Red Hat WMCO. Deploying Windows container workloads in production clusters is not supported without a subscription. If you do not have a subscription, you can use the community WMCO, a distribution that lacks official support. Request support through the link:http://access.redhat.com/[Red Hat Customer Portal].

=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the load balancer service would become unstable when the backing deployment had multiple pods scheduled on different Windows nodes. This issue has been fixed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1905950[**BZ#1905950**])

* Previously, WMCO added the public key annotation `windowsmachineconfig.openshift.io/pub-key-hash` to Linux nodes. Now, WMCO no longer adds an annotation to Linux nodes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1930791[**BZ#1930791**])

* Previously, when users provided an invalid private key, the WMCO would fail. With this update, the WMCO produces an error alerting the user of an invalid key. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1929579[*BZ#1929579*])

* Previously, the kube-proxy service would crash upon the creation of a load balancer service when the backing development had multiple pods scheduled on different Windows nodes. This issue has now been fixed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1939968[**BZ#1939968**])

* Previously, the `windows_exporter` component reported various metrics as `windows_*`. This error caused some of the node-level metrics that provide insight into the nodes through telemetry services to go unreported. Now, the componets export correctly showing all of the expected metrics. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1948037[**BZ#1948037**])

=== RHSA-2021:3001 - Windows Container support for {product-title} security update

As part of the previously noted bug fix (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1946538[**BZ#1946538**]), an update for Windows kube-proxy is now available for Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator 2.0.1. Details of the update are documented in the link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:2130[RHSA-2021:2130] advisory.

[id="wmco-3-0-0-known-issues"]
=== Known issues

* The file system graphs available in the web console do not display for Windows nodes. This is caused by changes in the file system queries. This will be fixed in a future release of WMCO. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1930347[*BZ#1930347*])
