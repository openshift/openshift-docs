== About Windows Container Support for Red Hat OpenShift

{productwinc} enables running Windows compute nodes in an {product-title} cluster. Running Windows workloads is possible by using the Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) to install and manage Windows nodes. With Windows nodes available, you can run Windows container workloads in {product-title}.

The release notes for {productwinc} tracks the development of the WMCO, which provides all Windows container workload capabilities in {product-title}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because link:https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/containers/important-update-deprecation-of-docker-virtual-machine-images/ba-p/3646272[Microsoft has stopped publishing Windows Server 2019 images with
Docker], Red Hat no longer supports Windows Azure for WMCO releases older than version 6.0.0. For WMCO 5.y.z and earlier, Windows Server 2019 images must have Docker pre-installed. WMCO 6.0.0 and later uses containerd as the runtime. You can upgrade to {product-title} 4.11, which uses WMCO 6.0.0.

== Getting support

// wording taken and modified from https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#windows

{productwinc} is provided and available as an optional, installable component. {productwinc} is not part of the {product-title} subscription. It requires an additional Red Hat subscription and is supported according to the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/production/soc/[Scope of coverage] and link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/production/sla[Service level agreements].

You must have this separate subscription to receive support for {productwinc}. Without this additional Red Hat subscription, deploying Windows container workloads in production clusters is not supported. You can request support through the link:http://access.redhat.com/[Red Hat Customer Portal]. 

For more information, see the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy document for link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#windows[Red Hat OpenShift support for Windows Containers].

If you do not have this additional Red Hat subscription, you can use the Community Windows Machine Config Operator, a distribution that lacks official support.

== Release notes for Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator 4.0.2

Issued: 2023-3-28

The WMCO 4.0.2 is now available with bug fixes. The components of the WMCO were released in link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2023:1488[RHBA-2023:1488]. 

[id="wmco-4-0-2-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, containers on Windows nodes were assigned a hard-coded DNS server IP address (such as 172.30.0.10) based on the default subnet. This caused DNS resolution to fail in certain situations. This fix removes the hard-coded DNS address, and Windows containers are now assigned a valid DNS server IP address that is based on the cluster DNS configuration. As a result, DNS resolution works as expected for Windows containers. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2020350[*BZ#2020350*])

[id="wmco-4-0-1"]
== Release notes for Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator 4.0.1

Issued: 2021-12-13

The WMCO 4.0.1 is now available with bug fixes. The components of the WMCO were released in link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2021:4757[RHBA-2021:4757].

[id="wmco-4-0-1-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the `windows-exporter` metrics endpoint object contained a reference to a deleted machine. This incorrect reference caused the WMCO to ignore deleted events for machines with invalid IP addresses. This bug fix removes the validation of the machine object from the event filtering, allowing the `windows-exporter` metrics endpoint object to correctly update when the machine is still in the `Deleting` phase. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2008992[*BZ#2008992*])

* Previously, deleting the node associated with a Windows `Machine` object returned a reconciliation error upon restart of the Operator. This bug fix opts not to react or reconcile when the node referenced by a Windows machine in the `Running` state is not found within the cluster, preventing any error loop and standardizing functionality with Linux machine objects. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2009474[*BZ#2009474*])

* Previously, certain commands being run by the WMCO in Windows VMs were not parsed correctly by PowerShell. This caused Windows VMs with PowerShell as its default SSH shell to be unable to join to a cluster as a node. The WMCO now identifies the default SSH shell of a Windows VM and runs the associated commands accordingly. This new capability allows Windows VMs with PowerShell as the default SSH shell to be configured as nodes in a cluster. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2014707[*BZ#2014707*])

* Previously, encrypted usernames were being generated with extra tags, which caused them not to display correctly. This bug fix removes the extra tags, allowing the encrypted username to display correctly. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2016712[*BZ#2016712*])

* Previously, the WMCO did not properly associate BYOH Windows VMs with their `Node` object when the VM was specified with a DNS object. This caused the WMCO to attempt to configure VMs that were already fully configured. The WMCO now resolves VMs specified by a DNS address when looking for an associated node. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2020648[*BZ#2020648*])

[id="wmco-4-0-0"]
== Release notes for Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator 4.0.0

This release of the WMCO provides bug fixes for running Windows compute nodes in an {product-title} cluster. The components of the WMCO 4.0.0 were released in link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2021:3702[RHBA-2021:3702].

[id="wmco-4-0-0-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the WMCO used the raw user-provided instance address when creating Bring-Your-Own-Host (BYOH) Windows nodes. This caused BYOH Windows instances to not join an {product-title} cluster. This bug fix ensures user-provided DNS names resolve to valid IPv4 addresses, and that the resolved value is used when creating BYOH Windows instances. Now BYOH instances with differing hostnames and DNS addresses can be configured as Windows Nodes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1995684[*BZ#1995684*])

* Previously, the WMCO performed direct comparisons using unresolved instance addresses when identifying instance-to-node associations. This caused BYOH Windows instances configured to join an {product-title} cluster to be removed. This bug fix validates DNS addresses by performing DNS lookups of entries that are added to the `windows-instances` config map. Now the WMCO can properly identify configured instance-to-node relationships, preventing any premature removals of BYOH nodes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2005126[*BZ#2005126*])

[id="wmco-4-0-0-known-issues"]
=== Known issues

* The file system graphs available in the web console do not display for Windows nodes. This issue is caused by changes in the file system queries, which will be fixed in a future release of WMCO. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1930347[*BZ#1930347*])

* For clusters installed on VMware vSphere, the WMCO ignored the `Deleting` phase notification event, leaving incorrect node information in the `windows-exporter` metrics endpoint. This resulted in an invalid mapping for the Prometheus metrics endpoint. This bug has been fixed; the WMCO now recognizes the `Deleting` phase notification event and maps the Prometheus metrics endpoint appropriately. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1995341[*BZ#1995341*])

* When the `RunAsUser` permission is set in the security context of a Linux-based pod, the projected files have the correct permissions set, including container user ownership. However, when the Windows equivalent `RunAsUsername` permission is set in a Windows pod, the kubelet is prevented from setting correct ownership on the files in the projected volume. This problem can get exacerbated when used in conjunction with a xref:../storage/persistent_storage/persistent-storage-hostpath.adoc#persistent-storage-using-hostpath[hostPath volume] where best practices are not followed. For example, giving a pod access to the `C:\var\lib\kubelet\pods\` folder results in that pod being able to access service account tokens from other pods.
+
By default, the projected files will have the following ownership, as shown in this example Windows projected volume file:
+

----
+
This indicates all administrator users, like someone with the `ContainerAdministrator` role, have read, write, and execute access, while non-administrator users have read and execute access.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} applies the `RunAsUser` security context to all pods irrespective of its operating system. This means Windows pods automatically have the `RunAsUser` permission applied to its security context. 
====
+
In addition, if a Windows pod is created with a projected volume with the default `RunAsUser` permission set, the pod gets stuck in the `ContainerCreating` phase.
+
To handle these issues, {product-title} forces the file permission handling in projected service account volumes set in the security context of the pod to not be honored for projected volumes on Windows (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1971745[BZ#1971745]). Note that this behavior for Windows pods is how file permission handling used to work for all pod types prior to {product-title} 4.7.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Running Windows container workloads is not supported for clusters in a restricted network or disconnected environment.
====

Version 4.x of the WMCO is only compatible with {product-title} 4.9.
