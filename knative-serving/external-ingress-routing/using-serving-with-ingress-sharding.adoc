toc::[]  

You can use Knative Serving with OpenShift ingress sharding to split ingress traffic based on domains. This allows you to manage and route network traffic to different parts of a cluster more efficiently.

[NOTE]
====
Even with OpenShift ingress sharding in place, {ServerlessProductName} traffic is still routed through a single Knative Ingress Gateway and the activator component in the `knative-serving` project.

For more information about isolating the network traffic, see xref:../../integrations/serverless-integrating-service-mesh/serverless-ossm-traffic-isolation.adoc#serverless-ossm-traffic-isolation[Using Service Mesh to isolate network traffic with OpenShift Serverless].
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving.
* You have cluster administrator permissions on {ocp-product-title}, or you have cluster or dedicated administrator permissions on {rosa-product-title} or {dedicated-product-title}.
