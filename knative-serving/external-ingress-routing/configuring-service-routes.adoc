= Configuring routes for Knative services
:context: configuring-service-routes


If you want to configure a Knative service to use your TLS certificate on {ocp-product-title}, you must disable the automatic creation of a route for the service by the {ServerlessOperatorName} and instead manually create a route for the service.

[NOTE]
====
When you complete the following procedure, the default {ocp-product-title} route in the `knative-serving-ingress` namespace is not created. However, the Knative route for the application is still created in this namespace.
