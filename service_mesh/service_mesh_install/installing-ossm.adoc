Installing the {ProductShortName} involves using the link:https://operatorhub.io/[OperatorHub] to install the Elasticsearch, Jaeger, Kiali, and {ProductShortName} Operators.

After you have installed the Operators, you use the {ProductName} operator to create the  `ServiceMeshControlPlane` custom resource definition.   You must install the Elasticsearch Operator, the Jaeger Operator, and the Kiali Operator before the {ProductName} Operator can create the control plane.  You use the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` to define the configuration to be used during installation of an instance of the service mesh. You can deploy the default configuration provided by Red Hat or customize the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` file to fit your business needs.

Then you use the {ProductName} operator to create the  `ServiceMeshMemberRoll`.  The `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` defines which services belong to an instance of the service mesh.
