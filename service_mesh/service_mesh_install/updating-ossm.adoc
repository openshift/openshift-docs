Updating {ProductName} requires extra steps before you update {product-title} to version 4.2. 
You must upgrade {ProductName} to 1.0.2 before upgrading {product-title} 4.1.x to 4.2.

.Prerequisites

* {ProductName} version 1.0.1
* {product-title} version 4.1

.Procedure

. Configure existing SMCP resource requests by running the following `oc patch` command. Replace
the <smcp_namespace> and <smcp_name> with your specific names:
+
----
$ oc patch -n <smcp_namespace> smcp <smcp_name> \// <1>
    --type=merge -p \
    '{"spec": {"istio": {"global": {"defaultResources": {"requests": {"cpu": "10m","memory": "128Mi"},"limits":{}},"proxy": {"resources": {"requests": {"cpu": "10m","memory": "128Mi"},"limits":{}}},"defaultPodDisruptionBudget": {"enabled": false}},"security": {"resources": {"requests": {"cpu": "10m","memory": "128Mi"}}},"galley": {"resources": {"requests": {"cpu": "10m","memory": "128Mi"}}},"pilot": {"resources": {"requests": {"cpu": "10m","memory": "128Mi"}}},"mixer": {"telemetry": {"resources": {"requests": {"cpu": "10m","memory": "128Mi"}}}},"gateways": {"istio-egressgateway": {"resources": {"requests": {"cpu": "10m","memory": "128Mi"}}},"istio-ingressgateway": {"resources": {"requests": {"cpu": "10m","memory": "128Mi"}}}},"prometheus": {"resources": {"requests": {"cpu": "10m","memory": "128Mi"}}}}}}'
----
<1> For example, `basic-install`.
+
After running this command, wait until all SMCP Pods are replaced in the SMCP namespace.
+
. After the Pods are running in the SMCP namespace, redeploy your Data Plane applications, such as `bookinfo`.  
+
. Log in as a `cluster-admin` user such as `kubeadmin`, and then run the following command to delete the CNI `istio-node` DaemonSet.  
Replace `openshift-operators` if your {ProductName} Operator was not installed in the default `openshift-operators` namespace:
+
----
$ oc delete -n openshift-operators daemonset istio-node
----
+
. Upgrade {ProductName} Operator and SMCP to 1.0.2. After all Pods are running in the SMCP namespace, patch Data Plane applications by running the following command for each deployment:
+
----
$ oc patch -n <data_plane_namespace> deployment/<deployment_name> -p \
    '{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"annotations":{"kubectl.kubernetes.io/restartedAt": "'`date -Iseconds`'"}}}}}'
----
+
. Upgrade {product-title} using the {product-title} web console.

If you're updating from {ProductName} 1.0 to 1.1, you must update the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource to update the control plane components to the new version. 

. In the web console, click the {ProductName} operator.

. Click the *Project* menu and choose the project where your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` is deployed from the list, for example `istio-system`.

. Click the name of your control plane, for example `basic-install`.

. Click YAML and add a version field to the `spec:` of your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource. For example, to update to {ProductName} 1.1.0, add `version: v1.1`.

----
spec:
  version: v1.1
  ...
----
  
The version field specifies the version of ServiceMesh to install and defaults to the latest available version.

== Manual updates

If you choose to update manually, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) controls the installation, upgrade, and role-based access control (RBAC) of Operators in a cluster. OLM runs by default in {product-title}.
OLM uses CatalogSources, which use the Operator Registry API, to query for available Operators as well as upgrades for installed Operators.

* For more information about how {product-title} handled upgrades, refer to the xref:../../operators/understanding_olm/olm-understanding-olm.adoc#olm-overview_olm-understanding-olm[Operator Lifecycle Manager] documentation.
