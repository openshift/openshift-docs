If you're updating from {ProductName} 1.0 to 1.1, you must update the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource to update the control plane components to the new version. 

. In the web console, click the {ProductName} operator.

. Click the *Project* menu and choose the project where your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` is deployed from the list, for example `istio-system`.

. Click the name of your control plane, for example `basic-install`.

. Click YAML and add a version field to the `spec:` of your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource. For example, to update to {ProductName} 1.1.0, add `version: v1.1`.

----
spec:
  version: v1.1

The version field specifies the version of ServiceMesh to install and defaults to the latest available version.

== Manual updates

If you choose to update manually, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) controls the installation, upgrade, and role-based access control (RBAC) of Operators in a cluster. OLM runs by default in {product-title}.
OLM uses CatalogSources, which use the Operator Registry API, to query for available Operators as well as upgrades for installed Operators.

* For more information about how {product-title} handled upgrades, refer to the xref:../../operators/understanding_olm/olm-understanding-olm.adoc#olm-overview_olm-understanding-olm[Operator Lifecycle Manager] documentation.
