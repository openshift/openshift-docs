{SMProductName} provides a platform for behavioral insight and operational control over your networked microservices in a service mesh. With {SMProductName}, you can connect, secure, and monitor microservices in your {product-title} environment.

== Understanding Kiali

Kiali provides visibility into your service mesh by showing you the microservices in your service mesh, and how they are connected.

== Understanding distributed tracing

Every time a user takes an action in an application, a request is executed by the architecture that may require dozens of different services to participate to produce a response.
The path of this request is a distributed transaction. The {JaegerShortName} lets you perform distributed tracing, which follows the path of a request through various microservices that make up an application.

*Distributed tracing* is a technique that is used to tie the information about different units of work together—usually executed in different processes or hosts—to understand a whole chain of events in a distributed transaction.
Distributed tracing lets developers visualize call flows in large service oriented architectures.
It can be invaluable in understanding serialization, parallelism, and sources of latency.

The {JaegerShortName} records the execution of individual requests across the whole stack of microservices, and presents them as traces. A *trace* is a data/execution path through the system. An end-to-end trace comprises one or more spans.

A *span* represents a logical unit of work that has an operation name, the start time of the operation, and the duration. Spans may be nested and ordered to model causal relationships.
