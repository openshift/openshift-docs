Installing the {ProductShortName} involves installing the Elasticsearch, Jaeger, Kiali and {ProductShortName} Operators, creating and managing a `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource to deploy the control plane, and creating a `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource to specify the namespaces associated with the {ProductShortName}.

[NOTE]
====
Multi-tenant control plane installations are the default configuration starting with {ProductName} 1.0.
====

[NOTE]
====
The {ProductShortName} documentation uses `istio-system` as the example project, but you may deploy the service mesh to any project.
====

== Prerequisites
* Follow the xref:../../service_mesh/v2x/preparing-ossm-installation.adoc#preparing-ossm-installation[Preparing to install {ProductName}] process.
* An account with the `cluster-admin` role.

The {ProductShortName} installation process uses the link:https://operatorhub.io/[OperatorHub] to install the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` custom resource definition within the `openshift-operators` project. The {ProductName} defines and monitors the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` related to the deployment, update, and deletion of the control plane.

Starting with {ProductName} {ProductVersion}, you must install the Elasticsearch Operator, the Jaeger Operator, and the Kiali Operator before the {ProductName} Operator can install the control plane.

For a multitenant installation, {ProductName} supports multiple independent control planes within the cluster.  You can create reusable configurations with `ServiceMeshControlPlane` profiles.  For more information, see xref:../../service_mesh/v2x/prepare-to-deploy-applications-ossm.adoc#ossm-control-plane-profiles_deploying-applications-ossm[Creating control plane profiles].

== Manual updates

If you choose to update manually, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) controls the installation, upgrade, and role-based access control (RBAC) of Operators in a cluster. OLM runs by default in {product-title}.
OLM uses CatalogSources, which use the Operator Registry API, to query for available Operators as well as upgrades for installed Operators.

* For more information about how {product-title} handled upgrades, refer to the xref:../../operators/understanding/olm/olm-understanding-olm.adoc#olm-overview_olm-understanding-olm[Operator Lifecycle Manager] documentation.

== Removing {ProductName}

This process allows you to remove {ProductName} from an existing {product-title} instance. Remove the control plane before removing the operators.
