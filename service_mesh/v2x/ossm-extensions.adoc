You can use WebAssembly extensions to add new features directly into the {ProductName} proxies, allowing you to move even more common functionality out of your applications, and implement them in a single language that compiles to WebAssembly bytecode.

== WebAssembly extensions

WebAssembly modules can be run on many platforms, including proxies, and has broad language support, fast execution and a sandboxed-by-default security model.

.Extension Capabilities

{ProductName} extensions are link:https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.16.0/intro/arch_overview/http/http_filters#arch-overview-http-filters[Envoy HTTP Filters], giving them a wide range of capabilities:

* Manipulating the body and headers of requests and responses
* Out-of-band HTTP requests to services not in the request path, such as authentication or policy checking
* Side-channel data storage and queues for filters to communicate with each other

There are two parts to writing a {ProductName} extension: you'll have to write your extension using an SDK that exposes the link:https://github.com/proxy-wasm/spec[proxy-wasm API] and compile it to a WebAssembly module, and then package it into a container.

.Supported languages

You can use any language that compiles to WebAssembly bytecode to write a {ProductName} extension, but the following languages have existing SDKs that expose the proxy-wasm API so that it can be consumed directly.

=== Container Format

You must have a `.wasm` file containing the bytecode of your WebAssembly module, and a `manifest.yaml` file in the root of the container filesystem to make your container image a valid extension image.

.manifest.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
schemaVersion: 1

name: <your-extension>
description: <description>
version: 1.0.0
phase: PreAuthZ
priority: 100
module: extension.wasm
----

.Field Reference for manifest.yml
|===
| Field | Description

|schemaVersion
|Used for versioning of the manifest schema. Currently the only possible value is `1`.

|name
|The name of your extension. This field is just metadata and currently unused.

|description
|The description of your extension. This field is just metadata and currently unused.

|version
|The version of your extension. This field is just metadata and currently unused.

|phase
|The default execution phase of your extension. This is a required field.

|priority
|The default priority of your extension. This is a required field.

|module
|The relative path from the container filesystem's root to your WebAssembly module. This is a required field.

=== Example Rust extension

For a complete example that was built using the Rust SDK, take a look at the link:https://github.com/maistra/header-append-filter[header-append-filter]. It is a simple filter that appends one or more headers to the HTTP responses, with their names and values taken out from the `config` field of the extension. See a sample configuration in the snippet below.

.ServiceMeshExtension Field Reference
|===
| Field | Description

|metadata.namespace
|The `metadata.namespace` of a `ServiceMeshExtension` source has a special semantic: if it equals the Control Plane Namespace, the extension will be applied to all workloads in the Service Mesh that match its `workloadSelector`. When deployed to any other Mesh Namespace, it will only be applied to workloads in that same Namespace.

|spec.workloadSelector
|The `spec.workloadSelector` field has the same semantic as the `spec.selector` field of the link:https://istio.io/v1.6/docs/reference/config/networking/gateway/#Gateway[Istio Gateway resource]. It will match a workload based on its Pod labels. If no `workloadSelector` is specified, the extension will be applied to all workloads in the namespace.

|spec.config
|This is a structured field that will be handed over to the extension, with the semantics dependent on the extension you are deploying.

|spec.image
|A container image URI pointing to the image that holds the extension.

|spec.phase
|This field defaults to the value set in the `manifest.yaml` of the extension, but can be overwritten by the user. The phase determines where in the filter chain the extension is injected, in relation to existing Istio functionality like Authentication, Authorization and metrics generation. Valid values are: PreAuthN, PostAuthN, PreAuthZ, PostAuthZ, PreStats, PostStats. This field defaults to the value set in the `manifest.yaml` of the extension, but can be overwritten by the user.

|spec.priority
|If multiple extensions with the same `spec.phase` are applied to the same workload instance, the `spec.priority` determines the ordering of execution. Extensions with higher priority will be executed first. This allows for inter-dependent extensions. This field defaults to the value set in the `manifest.yaml` of the extension, but can be overwritten by the user.
