After adding your services to a mesh, enable automatic sidecar injection in the deployment resource for your application. You must enable automatic sidecar injection for each deployment. 

If you have installed the Bookinfo sample application, the application was deployed and the sidecars were injected. If you are using your own project and service, deploy your applications on {product-title}. For more information, see xref:../../applications/deployments/what-deployments-are.html[Understanding Deployment and DeploymentConfig objects].
