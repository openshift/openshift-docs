[NOTE]
====
Because {SMProductName} releases on a different cadence from {product-title} and because the {SMProductName} Operator supports deploying multiple versions of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane`, the {SMProductShortName} documentation does not maintain separate documentation sets for minor versions of the product.  The current documentation set applies to the most recent version of {SMProductShortName} unless version-specific limitations are called out in a particular topic or for a particular feature.

For additional information about the {SMProductName} life cycle and supported platforms, refer to the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#ossm[Platform Life Cycle Policy].
