You can view your application's topology, health, and metrics in the Kiali console. If your service is experiencing problems, the Kiali console allows you to view the data flow through your service. You can view insights about the mesh components at different levels, including abstract applications, services, and workloads. It also provides an interactive graph view of your namespace in real time.

You can observe the data flow through your application if you have an application installed. If you do not have your own application installed, you can see how observability works in {ProductName} by installing the xref:../../service_mesh/v2x/prepare-to-deploy-applications-ossm.adoc#ossm-tutorial-bookinfo-overview_ossm-create-mesh[Bookinfo sample application].
