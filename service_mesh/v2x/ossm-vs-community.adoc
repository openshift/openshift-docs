An installation of {ProductName} differs from upstream Istio community installations in multiple ways. The modifications to {ProductName} are sometimes necessary to resolve issues, provide additional features, or to handle differences when deploying on {product-title}.

The current release of {ProductName} differs from the current upstream Istio community release in the following ways:

== Deployment models

Whereas upstream Istio takes a single tenant approach, {ProductName} supports multiple independent control planes within the cluster. {ProductName} uses a multitenant operator to manage the control plane lifecycle. 

The main difference between a multitenant installation and a cluster-wide installation is the scope of privileges used by the control plane deployment, Istiod. 

[id="ossm-cluster-scoped-resources_{context}"]
== Cluster scoped resources

Upstream Istio has two cluster scoped resources that it relies on. The `MeshPolicy` and the `ClusterRbacConfig`. These are not compatible with a multitenant cluster and have been replaced as described below.

* _ServiceMeshPolicy_ replaces MeshPolicy for configuration of control-plane-wide authentication policies. This must be created in the same project as the control plane.
* _ServicemeshRbacConfig_ replaces ClusterRbacConfig for configuration of control-plane-wide role based access control. This must be created in the same project as the control plane.
