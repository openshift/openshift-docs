The `must-gather` tool enables you to collect diagnostic information about your
{product-title} cluster, including virtual machines and other data related to
{SMProductName}. You can send that diagnostic information to support for both {product-title} and {SMProductName}.

include::modules/about-must-gather.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

=== Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. If you use {product-dedicated}, you must have an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.

* The {product-title} CLI (`oc`) installed.
