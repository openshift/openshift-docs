toc::[]

The control plane includes Istiod, Ingress and Egress Gateways, and other components, such as Kiali and Jaeger. The control plane must be deployed in a separate namespace than the {SMProductShortName} Operators and the data plane applications and services. You can deploy a basic installation of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane`(SMCP) from the {product-title} web console or the command line using the `oc` client tool.

[NOTE]
====
This basic installation is configured based on the default OpenShift settings and is not designed for production use. Use this default installation to verify your installation, and then configure your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` for your environment.
====

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) places additional restrictions on where you can create resources and as a result the default deployment does not work. See xref:../../service_mesh/v2x/ossm-create-smcp.adoc#ossm-install-rosa_ossm-create-smcp[Installing Service Mesh on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS] for additional requirements before deploying your SMCP in a ROSA environment.
====

[NOTE]
====
The {SMProductShortName} documentation uses `istio-system` as the example project, but you can deploy the service mesh to any project.

== Additional resources

{SMProductName} supports multiple independent control planes within the cluster. You can create reusable configurations with `ServiceMeshControlPlane` profiles. For more information, see xref:../../service_mesh/v2x/ossm-profiles-users.adoc#ossm-control-plane-profiles_ossm-profiles-users[Creating control plane profiles].

== Next steps

* Add a project to the {SMProductShortName} so that applications can be made available. For more information, see xref:../../service_mesh/v2x/ossm-create-mesh.adoc#ossm-create-mesh[Adding services to a service mesh].
