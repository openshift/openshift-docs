toc::[]

You can deploy a basic installation of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` by using either the {product-title} web console or from the command line using the `oc` client tool.

[NOTE]
====
This basic installation is configured based on the default OpenShift settings and is not designed for production use.  Use this default installation to verify your installation, and then configure your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` for your environment.
====

[NOTE]
====
The {SMProductShortName} documentation uses `istio-system` as the example project, but you can deploy the service mesh to any project.

== Additional resources

{SMProductName} supports multiple independent control planes within the cluster. You can create reusable configurations with `ServiceMeshControlPlane` profiles. For more information, see xref:../../service_mesh/v2x/ossm-profiles-users.adoc#ossm-control-plane-profiles_ossm-profiles-users[Creating control plane profiles].

== Next steps

Create a `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource to specify the namespaces associated with the {SMProductShortName}. For more information, see xref:../../service_mesh/v2x/ossm-create-mesh.adoc#ossm-create-mesh[Adding services to a service mesh].
