After installing the Operators and `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource, add applications, workloads, or services to your mesh by creating a `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource and specifying the namespaces where your content is located. If you already have an application, workflow, or service to add to a `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource, use the following steps. Or, to install a sample application called Bookinfo and add it to a  `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource, skip to the tutorial for installing the xref:../../service_mesh/v2x/ossm-create-mesh.adoc#ossm-tutorial-bookinfo-overview_ossm-create-mesh[Bookinfo example application] to see how an application works in {ProductName}.

The items listed in the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource are the applications and workflows that are managed by the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource. The control plane, which includes the {ProductShortName} Operators, Istiod, and `ServiceMeshControlPlane`, and the data plane, which includes applications and Envoy proxy, must be in separate namespaces.

[NOTE]
====
After you add the namespace to the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll`, access to services or pods in that namespace will not be accessible to callers outside the service mesh.
