The default `ServiceMeshControlPlane` settings are not intended for production use; they are designed to install successfully on a default OpenShift installation, which is an extremely resource limited environment.   After you have verified a successful SMCP installation, you should modify the settings defined within the SMCP to suit your environment.  This section provides guidance for configuring {ProductName} for production use.

See xref:../../service_mesh/v2x/ossm-custom-resources.adoc#ossm-custom-resources[Custom resources] for more information about the configurable fields in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.
