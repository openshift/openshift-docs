{ProductName} supports independent control planes. In a typical service mesh deployment, a control plane configures policies and routes traffic, while one or several data planes manage sidecars, which are intelligent proxies that intercept and control traffic. By creating a `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource, the control plane can set the policies for many data planes in different projects or namespaces. {ProductName} configures each member project to ensure network access between itself, the control plane, and other member projects.
