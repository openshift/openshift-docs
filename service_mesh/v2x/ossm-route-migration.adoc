Automatic route creation, also known as Istio OpenShift Routing (IOR), is a deprecated feature that is disabled by default for any `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource that was created using {SMProductName} 2.5 and later. Migrating from IOR to explicitly-managed routes provides a more flexible way to manage and configure ingress gateways. When route resources are explicitly created they can be managed alongside the other gateway and application resources as part of a GitOps management model.
