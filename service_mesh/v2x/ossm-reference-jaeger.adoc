When the {SMProductShortName} Operator deploys the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource, it can also create the resources for distributed tracing. {SMProductShortName} uses Jaeger for distributed tracing.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Jaeger does not use FIPS validated cryptographic modules.

* Starting with {SMProductName} 2.5, {JaegerName} is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Red{nbsp}Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this feature during the current release lifecycle, but this feature will no longer receive enhancements and will be removed. As an alternative to {JaegerName}, you can use {TempoName} instead.
