== Troubleshooting the control plane

The Service Mesh _control plane_ is composed of Istiod, which consolidates several previous control plane components (Citadel, Galley, Pilot) into a single binary. Deploying the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` also creates the other components that make up {SMProductName} as described in the xref:../../service_mesh/v2x/ossm-architecture.adoc#ossm-architecture_ossm-architecture[architecture] topic.

== Troubleshooting the data plane

The _data plane_ is a set of intelligent proxies that intercept and control all inbound and outbound network communications between services in the service mesh.

{SMProductName} relies on a proxy sidecar within the applicationâ€™s pod to provide service mesh capabilities to the application.
