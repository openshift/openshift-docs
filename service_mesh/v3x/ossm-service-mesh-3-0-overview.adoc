{SMProductName} manages and secures communication between microservices by providing traffic management, advanced routing, and load balancing. {SMProductName} also enhances security through features like mutual TLS, and offers observability with metrics, logging, and tracing to monitor and troubleshoot applications.

[NOTE]
====
Because {SMProductName} 3.0 releases on a different cadence from {product-title}, the {SMProductShortName} documentation is available as a separate documentation set at link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_mesh[{SMProductName}].
