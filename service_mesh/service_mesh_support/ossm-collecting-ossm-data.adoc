When opening a support case, it is helpful to provide debugging
information about your cluster to Red Hat Support.

The `must-gather` tool enables you to collect diagnostic information about your
{product-title} cluster, including virtual machines and other data related to
{ProductName}.

For prompt support, supply diagnostic information for both {product-title}
and {ProductName}.

== Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
