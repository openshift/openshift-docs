{cluster-manager-first} is a managed service where you can install, modify, operate, and upgrade your Red Hat OpenShift clusters. This service allows you to work with all of your organizationâ€™s clusters from a single dashboard.

{cluster-manager} guides you to install {OCP}, {product-title}, and {product-short-name} clusters. It is also responsible for managing both {OCP} clusters after self-installation as well as your {product-title} and {product-short-name} clusters.
//Does this make sense? Is this a post-publish HCP pruning task?

You can use {cluster-manager} to do the following actions:

* Create clusters
* View cluster details and metrics
* Manage your clusters with tasks such as scaling, changing node labels, networking, authentication
* Manage access control
* Monitor clusters
* Schedule upgrades

== General actions

On the top right of the cluster page, there are some actions that a user can perform on the entire cluster:

* **Actions** drop-down menu allows the cluster owner to rename the display name of the cluster, edit the machine pools, and delete the cluster.

You may also transfer the cluster's ownership to another user.
