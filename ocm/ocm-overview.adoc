{cluster-manager-first} is a managed service where you can install, modify, operate, and upgrade your Red Hat OpenShift clusters. This service allows you to work with all of your organization’s clusters from a single dashboard.

{cluster-manager} guides you to install {OCP}, {product-title}, and {product-short-name} clusters. It is also responsible for managing both {OCP} clusters after self-installation as well as your

ifdef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
{rosa-short} 
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]

You can use {cluster-manager} to do the following actions:

* Create clusters
* View cluster details and metrics
* Manage your clusters with tasks such as scaling, changing node labels, networking, authentication
* Manage access control
* Monitor clusters
* Schedule upgrades
