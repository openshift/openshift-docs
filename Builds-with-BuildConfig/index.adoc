{product-title} is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes platform for developers, which enables organizations to automate the application delivery process through DevOps practices, such as continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD). To meet your organizational needs, the {product-title} provides the following CI/CD solutions:

* OpenShift Builds
* {pipelines-shortname}
* OpenShift GitOps

[id="openshift-builds"]
== OpenShift Builds
With OpenShift Builds, you can create cloud-native apps by using a declarative build process. You can define the build process in a YAML file that you use to create a BuildConfig object. This definition includes attributes such as build triggers, input parameters, and source code. When deployed, the BuildConfig object typically builds a runnable image and pushes it to a container image registry.

OpenShift Builds provides the following extensible support for build strategies:

* Docker build
* Source-to-image (S2I) build
* Custom build

[id="openshift-pipelines"]
== {pipelines-shortname}
{pipelines-shortname} provides a Kubernetes-native CI/CD framework to design and run each step of the CI/CD pipeline in its own container. It can scale independently to meet the on-demand pipelines with predictable outcomes.

For more information, see xref:../cicd/pipelines/understanding-openshift-pipelines.adoc#understanding-openshift-pipelines[Understanding {pipelines-shortname}]

[id="openshift-gitops"]
== OpenShift GitOps
OpenShift GitOps is an Operator that uses Argo CD as the declarative GitOps engine. It enables GitOps workflows across multicluster OpenShift and Kubernetes infrastructure. Using OpenShift GitOps, administrators can consistently configure and deploy Kubernetes-based infrastructure and applications across clusters and development lifecycles.

For more information, see xref:../cicd/gitops/understanding-openshift-gitops.adoc#understanding-openshift-gitops[Understanding OpenShift GitOps]

[id="jenkins-ci-cd"]
== Jenkins
Jenkins automates the process of building, testing, and deploying applications and projects. OpenShift Developer Tools provides a Jenkins image that integrates directly with the {product-title}. Jenkins can be deployed on OpenShift by using the Samples Operator templates or certified Helm chart.
