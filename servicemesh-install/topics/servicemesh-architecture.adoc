= {ProductName} Product Architecture

{ProductName}  is logically split into a data plane and a control plane:

* The *data plane* is composed of a set of intelligent proxies deployed as sidecars. These proxies intercept and control all inbound and outbound network communication between microservices in the service mesh, and also communicate with Mixer, the general-purpose policy and telemetry hub.

* The *control plane* is responsible for managing and configuring proxies to route traffic, and configuring Mixers to enforce policies and collect telemetry.

The components that make up the data plan and the control plane are as follows:

* *Envoy proxy* is the _data plane_ component which  intercepts all inbound and outbound traffic for all services in the service mesh. Envoy is deployed as a sidecar to the relevant service in the same pod.
* *Mixer* is the _control plane_ component responsible responsible for enforcing access control and usage policies (such as authorization, rate limits, quotas, authentication, request tracing) and collecting telemetry data from the Envoy proxy and other services.
* *Pilot* - is the _control plane_ component responsible for configuring the proxies at runtime.
* *Citadel* - is the _control plane_ component which is responsible for certificate issuance and rotation.
