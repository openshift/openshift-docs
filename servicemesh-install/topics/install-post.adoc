= Verifying Installation

////
TODO - Check against current installation
////
The above instructions will create a job within the istio-system project to install Istio using Ansible playbooks, the progress of the installation can be followed by either watching the pods or the log output from the `openshift-ansible-istio-installer-job` pod.

To watch the progress of the pods execute the following command:

```
istiooc get pods -n istio-system -w
```

Once the `openshift-ansible-istio-installer-job` has completed run `istiooc get pods -n istio-system` and verify you have state similar to the following"

```
