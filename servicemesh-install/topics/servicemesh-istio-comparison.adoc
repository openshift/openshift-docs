= Comparing {ProductName} and upstream Istio community installations
An installation of {ProductName} differs from upstream Istio community installations in multiple ways. The modifications to {ProductName} are sometimes necessary to resolve issues, provide additional features, or to handle differences when deploying on OpenShift.

The current release of {ProductName} differs from the current upstream Istio community release in the following ways:

== Automatic injection
The upstream Istio community installation automatically injects the sidecar to namespaces you have labeled.

{ProductName} does not automatically inject the sidecar to any namespaces, but requires you to specify the `sidecar.istio.io/inject` annotation as illustrated in the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/servicemesh-install/servicemesh-install.html#automatic-sidecar-injection[Automatic sidecar injection] section.

== Role Based Access Control features
Role Based Access Control (RBAC) provides a mechanism you can use to control access to a service. You can identify subjects by username or by specifying a set of properties and apply access controls accordingly.

The upstream Istio community installation includes options to perform exact header matches, match wildcards in headers, or check for a header containing a specific prefix or suffix.

{ProductName} extends the ability to match request headers by using a regular expression. Specify a property key of `request.regex.headers` with a regular expression.
