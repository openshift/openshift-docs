Need a short overview of Grafana.

Building on the `bookinfo` tutorial, shows you how to setup and use the Istio Dashboard to monitor mesh traffic. As part of this task, you will install the Grafana Istio add-on and use the web-based interface for viewing service mesh traffic data.

Prerequisites:

* OpenShift Container Catalog 3.10 or higher installed.
* {ProductName} {ProductVersion} installed.
* `Bookinfo` demonstration application installed.

== Accessing the Grafana dashboard

. A route to access the Grafana dashboard should already exist. Query OpenShift for details of the route:
+
```
  $ export GRAFANA_URL=$(oc get route -n istio-system grafana -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
```
+
. Launch a browser and navigate to navigate to `http://${GRAFANA_URL}`.  You should see Grafana's home screen, similar to the image below:
+

+
. From the menu in the top left corner, select "Istio Mesh Dashboard" to see Istio mesh metrics.
+

+
. Generate some traffic by accessing Bookinfo application:
+
```
  $ curl -o /dev/null http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage
```
+
The dashboard should reflect the traffic through the mesh, similar to the following image:
+

+
. To see detailed metrics for a service click on a service name in the "Service" column. The service dashboard will look similar to the following image:
+
image::grafana-services.png[]
+
Note that "Tcp Bandwidth" metrics are empty, as Bookinfo uses http-based services only. Lower down on this dashboard are metrics for workloads that call this service (labeled "Client Workloads") and for workloads that process requests from the service (labeled "Service Workloads"). You can switch to a different service or filter metrics by client- and service-workloads by using the menus at the top of the dashboard.
+
. To switch to workloads dashboard, select "Istio Workload Dashboard" from the drop-down list in the top left corner of the screen. You should see a screen similar to the following image:
+
image::grafana-workloads.png[]
+
This dashboard shows workload's metrics, and metrics for client- (inbound) and service (outbound) workloads. You can switch to a different workload, to filter metrics by inbound or outbound workloads by using menus at the top of the dashboard.

== Removing the Grafana tutorial

The procedure for removing the Grafana tutorial is the same as removing the Bookinfo tutorial.
