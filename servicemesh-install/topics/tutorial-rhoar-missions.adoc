[[rhoar-missions]]
= Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtime Missions

In addition to the `bookinfo` based tutorials, there are are four {ProductShortName}-specific tutorials (missions) and sample applications (boosters) that you can use with the Fabric8 integrated development platform launcher to explore some of the Istio features.  Each of these boosters and missions is available for four different application runtimes. For more information about Fabric8, see the https://launcher.fabric8.io/docs/[Fabric8 documentation].
