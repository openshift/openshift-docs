TODO
Need a short overview for distributed tracing and Jaeger.
////
This tutorial uses {ProductShortName} and the `bookinfo` tutorial to demonstrate how you can perform a trace using the Jaeger component of {ProductName}.

Prerequisites:

* OpenShift Container Catalog 3.10 or higher installed.
* {ProductName} {ProductVersion} installed.
* `Bookinfo` demonstration application installed.  


== Generating Traces and Analyzing Trace Data

. Once you've deployed the Bookinfo application, generate some activity by accessing http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage and refreshing the page a few times.
.  A route to access the Jaeger dashboard should already exist. Query OpenShift for details of the route:
+
```
  $ oc get routes jaeger-query -n istio-system
  NAME           HOST/PORT                                    PATH      SERVICES       PORT           TERMINATION   WILDCARD
  jaeger-query   jaeger-query-istio-system.127.0.0.1.nip.io             jaeger-query   jaeger-query   edge          None

```
+
. Launch a browser and navigate to https://jaeger-query-istio-system.127.0.0.1.nip.io.

. In the left-hand pane of the Jaeger dashboard, from the Service menu, select "productpage" and click the *Find Traces* button at the bottom of the pane.
+
 You should see a list of available traces similar to the image below:
+

+
. Click one of the traces in the list to open a detailed view of that trace.  If you click on the top (most recent) trace, you should see the details corresponding to your latest refresh of the ``/productpage`. 
+

+
The trace in the image above consists of a few nested spans, each corresponding to a Bookinfo service call, all performed in response to a /productpage request. Overall processing time was 2.62s, with the "details" service taking 3.56ms, the "reviews" service taking 2.6s, and the "ratings" service taking 5.32ms. Each of the calls to remote services is represented by a client-side and server-side spans. For example, the "details" client-side span is labeled `productpage details.myproject.svc.cluster.local:9080`. The span nested underneath it, labeled `details details.myproject.svc.cluster.local:9080`, corresponds to the server-side processing of the request. The trace also shows calls to "istio-policy" which reflect authorization checks made by istio. 

== Removing the JaegerTracing Tutorial

The procedure for removing the JaegerTracing tutorial is the same as removing the Bookinfo tutorial.
