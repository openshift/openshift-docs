* OpenShift Container Platform version 3.10 or higher installed.   For more information about the system and environment requirements, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.10/html/installing_clusters/install-config-install-prerequisites#system-requirements[OpenShift Container Platform documentation].
* {ProductName} is only available on OCP x86_64.
* {ProductName} is only suited for OpenShift Container Platform Software Defined Networking (OCP SDN).


## Preparing the OCP 3.10 Installation

Before {ProductShortName} can be installed into an OCP 3.10 installation it is necessary to make a number of changes to the master configuration and each of the schedulable nodes.  These changes will enable features required within {ProductShortName} and also ensure Elasticsearch will function correctly.

### Updating the Master Configuration

To enable the automatic injection of the {ProductShortName} sidecar we first need to modify the master configuration on each master to include support for webhooks and signing of Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs).

Make the following changes on each master within your OCP 3.10 installation:

- Change to the directory containing the master configuration file (master-config.yaml)
- Create a file named master-config.patch with the following contents (also in `master-config.patch`)

```
admissionConfig:
  pluginConfig:
    MutatingAdmissionWebhook:
      configuration:
        apiVersion: v1
        disable: false
        kind: DefaultAdmissionConfig
    ValidatingAdmissionWebhook:
      configuration:
        apiVersion: v1
        disable: false
        kind: DefaultAdmissionConfig
```

- Within the same directory issue the following commands:

```
cp -p master-config.yaml master-config.yaml.prepatch
istiooc ex config patch master-config.yaml.prepatch -p "$(cat master-config.patch)" > master-config.yaml
systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master*
```

### Updating the Nodes
In order to run the Elasticsearch application it is necessary to make a change to the kernel configuration on each node, this change will be handled through the `sysctl` service.

Make the following changes on each node within your OCP 3.10 installation

- Create a file named `/etc/sysctl.d/99-elasticsearch.conf` with the following contents:

`vm.max_map_count = 262144`

- Execute the following command:

```
sysctl vm.max_map_count=262144
```
