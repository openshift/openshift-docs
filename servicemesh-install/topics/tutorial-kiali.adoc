[[kiali-tutorial]]
= Kiali tutorial

Kiali works with Istio to visualize your service mesh topology to provide visibility into features like circuit breakers, request rates, and more.  Kiali offers insights about the mesh components at different levels, from abstract Applications to Services and Workloads.  Kiali provides an interactive graph view of your namespace in real time.  It can display the interactions at several levels (applications, versions, workloads) with contextual information and charts on the selected graph node or edge.

This tutorial uses {ProductShortName} and the `bookinfo` tutorial to demonstrate how you can use the Kiali console to view the topography and health of your service mesh.

Prerequisites:

* {product-title} 3.11 or higher installed.
* {ProductName} {ProductVersion} installed.
* Kiali parameters specified in the custom resource file.
* `Bookinfo` demonstration application installed.

[[accessing-kiali-console]]
== Accessing the Kiali console

. A route to access the Kiali console already exists. Run the following command to obtain the route and Kiali URL:
+
----
$ oc get routes
