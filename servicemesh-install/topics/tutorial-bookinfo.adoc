= Bookinfo Tutorial

The upstream Istio project has an example tutorial called https://istio.io/docs/examples/bookinfo[bookinfo], which is composed of four separate microservices used to demonstrate various Istio features.

The Bookinfo application displays information about a book, similar to a single catalog entry of an online book store. Displayed on the page is a description of the book, book details (ISBN, number of pages, and so on), and a few book reviews.

The Bookinfo application is broken into four separate microservices:

* `productpage` - The `productpage` microservice calls the `details` and `reviews` microservices to populate the page.
* `details` - The `details` microservice contains book information.
* `reviews` - The `reviews` microservice contains book reviews. It also calls the `ratings` microservice.
* `ratings` - The `ratings` microservice contains book ranking information that accompanies a book review.

There are 3 versions of the reviews microservice:

* Version v1 doesnâ€™t call the `ratings` service.
* Version v2 calls the `ratings` service, and displays each rating as 1 to 5 black stars.
* Version v3 calls the `ratings` service, and displays each rating as 1 to 5 red stars.
  
== Installing the Bookinfo Application

The following steps describe deploying and running the Bookinfo tutorial on OpenShift Container Platform 3.10 with {ProductShortName} {ProductVersion}.

. Update the Security Context Constraints (SCC) by adding the service account used by Bookinfo to the `anyuid` SCC in the _"myproject"_ namespace:
+
```
  $ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default -n myproject
```
+

. Download the `bookinfo.yaml` file to your local directory:
+
```
  $ curl -o bookinfo.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/bookinfo/master/bookinfo.yaml
```

. Deploy the Bookinfo application in the _"myproject"_ namespace:
+   
```
  $ oc apply -n myproject -f bookinfo.yaml
```

. Download the `bookinfo-gateway.yaml` to your local directory:
+
```
  $ curl -o bookinfo-gateway.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/bookinfo/master/bookinfo-gateway.yaml 
```

. Create the ingress gateway for Bookinfo:
+
```
  $ oc apply -f bookinfo-gateway.yaml
```

. Set the value for the `GATEWAY_URL` parameter:
+
```
  $ export GATEWAY_URL=$(oc get route istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system -o=jsonpath="{.spec.host}")
```


== Verifying the Bookinfo Installation

To confirm that the application has been successfully deployed run this command:

```
  $ curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}\n" http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage
```

Alternatively, you can open `http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage` in your browser.

== Removing the Bookinfo Application

. Download the cleanup script:
+
```
  $ curl -o cleanup.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/bookinfo/master/cleanup.sh && chmod +x ./cleanup.sh
```

. Delete the Bookinfo virtualservice, gateway, and terminate the pods by running the cleanup script:
+
```
  $ ./cleanup.sh
  namespace ? [default] myproject
```
. Confirm shutdown by running these commands:
+
```
  $ oc get virtualservices -n myproject
  No resources found.
  $ oc get gateway -n myproject
  No resources found.
  $ oc get pods -n myproject
  No resources found.
```
