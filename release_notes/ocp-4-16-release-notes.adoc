== About this release

// TODO: Update with the relevant information closer to release.
{product-title} (link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7198[RHSA-2023:7198]) is now available. This release uses link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.29.md[Kubernetes 1.29] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at https://console.redhat.com/openshift. With the {cluster-manager-first} application for {product-title}, you can deploy {product-title} clusters to either on-premises or cloud environments.

// Double check OP system versions
{product-title} {product-version} is supported on {op-system-base-full} 8.8 and 8.9, and on {op-system-first} 4.15.

You must use {op-system} machines for the control plane, and you can use either {op-system} or {op-system-base} for compute machines.
//Removed the note per https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GRPA-3517

For {product-title} 4.12 on `x86_64` architecture, Red Hat has added a 6-month Extended Update Support (EUS) phase that extends the total available lifecycle from 18 months to 24 months. For {product-title} 4.12 running on 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), and {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architectures, the EUS lifecycle remains at 18 months.

Starting with {product-title} 4.14, each EUS phase for even numbered releases on all supported architectures, including `x86_64`, 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), and {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architectures, has a total available lifecycle of 24 months.

Starting with {product-title} 4.14, Red Hat offers a 12-month additional EUS add-on, denoted as _Additional EUS Term 2_, that extends the total available lifecycle from 24 months to 36 months. The Additional EUS Term 2 is available on all architecture variants of {product-title}.

For more information about this support, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

//TODO: The line below should be used when it is next appropriate. Revisit in August 2023 time frame.
Maintenance support ends for version 4.12 on 25 January 2025 and goes to extended life phase. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

Commencing with the {product-version} release, Red Hat is simplifying the administration and management of Red Hat shipped cluster Operators with the introduction of three new life cycle classifications; Platform Aligned, Platform Agnostic, and Rolling Stream. These life cycle classifications provide additional ease and transparency for cluster administrators to understand the life cycle policies of each Operator and form cluster maintenance and upgrade plans with predictable support boundaries. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/j/includes/session/scribe/?redirectTo=https%3A%2F%2Faccess.redhat.com%2Fsupport%2Fpolicy%2Fupdates%2Fopenshift_operators[OpenShift Operator Life Cycles].

// Added in 4.14. Language came directly from Kirsten Newcomer.
{product-title} is designed for FIPS. When running {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures.

For more information about the NIST validation program, see link:https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules[Cryptographic Module Validation Program].

[id="ocp-4-16-installation-and-update_{context}"]
=== Installation and update

[id="ocp-4-16-installation-and-update-aws-capi_{context}"]
==== Cluster API replaces Terraform for AWS installations
In {product-title} {product-version}, the installation program uses Cluster API instead of Terraform to provision cluster infrastructure during installations on AWS. There are several additional required permissions as a result of this change. For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.adoc#installation-aws-permissions_installing-aws-account[Required AWS permissions for the IAM user].

Additionally, SSH access to control plane and compute machines is no longer open to the machine network, but is restricted to the security groups associated with the control plane and compute plane machines.

[id="ocp-4-16-installation-and-update-optional-ccm_{context}"]
==== Optional cloud controller manager cluster capability

In {product-title} {product-version}, you can disable the cloud controller manager capability during installation.
For more information, see xref:../installing/cluster-capabilities.adoc#cluster-cloud-controller-manager-operator_cluster-capabilities[Cloud controller manager capability].

[id="ocp-4-16-installation-and-update-vsphere-tagging_{context}"]
==== Optional additional tags for {vmw-first}

In {product-title} {product-version}, you can add up to ten tags to attach to the VMs provisioned by a {vmw-first} cluster.
These tags are in addition to the unique cluster-specific tag that the installation program uses to identify and remove associated VMs when a cluster is decommissioned.

You can define the tags on the {vmw-first} VMs in the `install-config.yaml` file during cluster creation.
For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_vsphere/ipi/installing-restricted-networks-installer-provisioned-vsphere.adoc#installation-installer-provisioned-vsphere-config-yaml_installing-restricted-networks-installer-provisioned-vsphere[Sample `install-config.yaml` file for an installer-provisioned {vmw-first} cluster].

You can define tags for compute or control plane machines on an existing cluster by using machine sets.
For more information, see "Adding tags to machines by using machine sets" for xref:../machine_management/creating_machinesets/creating-machineset-vsphere.adoc#machine-api-vmw-add-tags_creating-machineset-vsphere[compute] or xref:../machine_management/control_plane_machine_management/cpmso_provider_configurations/cpmso-config-options-vsphere.adoc#machine-api-vmw-add-tags_cpmso-config-options-vsphere[control plane] machine sets.

[id="ocp-4-16-admin-ack-updating_{context}"]
==== Required administrator acknowledgment when updating from {product-title} 4.15 to 4.16

{product-title} 4.16 uses Kubernetes 1.29, which removed several xref:../release_notes/ocp-4-16-release-notes.adoc#ocp-4-16-removed-kube-1-29-apis_{context}[deprecated APIs].

A cluster administrator must provide manual acknowledgment before the cluster can be updated from {product-title} 4.15 to 4.16. This is to help prevent issues after updating to {product-title} 4.16, where APIs that have been removed are still in use by workloads, tools, or other components running on or interacting with the cluster. Administrators must evaluate their cluster for any APIs in use that will be removed and migrate the affected components to use the appropriate new API version. After this is done, the administrator can provide the administrator acknowledgment.

All {product-title} 4.15 clusters require this administrator acknowledgment before they can be updated to {product-title} 4.16.

For more information, see xref:../updating/preparing_for_updates/updating-cluster-prepare.adoc#updating-cluster-prepare[Preparing to update to {product-title} 4.16].

[id="ocp-4-16-installation-and-update-kubeadmin_{context}"]
==== Secure kubeadmin password from being displayed in the console

With this release, you can prevent the `kubeadmin` password from being displayed in the console after the installation by using the `--skip-password-print` flag during cluster creation. The password remains accessible in the `auth` directory.

[id="ocp-4-16-appliance-utility_{context}"]
==== OpenShift-based Appliance Builder (Technology Preview)

With this release, the OpenShift-based Appliance Builder is available as a Technology Preview feature.
The Appliance Builder enables self-contained {product-title} cluster installations, meaning that it does not rely on internet connectivity or external registries.
It is a container-based utility that builds a disk image that includes the Agent-based Installer, which can then be used to install multiple {product-title} clusters.

For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7065136[OpenShift-based Appliance Builder User Guide].

[id="ocp-4-16-installation-and-update-byoip_{context}"]
==== Bring your own IPv4 (BYOIP) feature enabled for installation on AWS

With this release, you can enable bring your own public IPv4 addresses (BYOIP) feature when installing on AWS by using the `publicIpv4Pool` field to allocate Elastic IP addresses (EIPs). You must ensure that you have the xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.adoc#installation-aws-permissions_installing-aws-account[required permissions] to enable BYOIP. For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_aws/installation-config-parameters-aws.adoc#installation-configuration-parameters-optional-aws_installation-config-parameters-aws[Optional AWS configuration parameters].

[id="ocp-4-16-networking-connectivity-pod-placement_{context}"]
==== Configuring pod placement to check network connectivity

To periodically test network connectivity amongst cluster components, the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) creates the `network-check-source` deployment and the `network-check-target` daemon set. In {product-title} 4.16, you can configure the nodes by setting node selectors and run the source and target pods to check the network connectivity. For more information, see xref:../networking/verifying-connectivity-endpoint.adoc#verifying-connectivity-endpoint[Verifying connectivity to an endpoint].

[id="ocp-4-16-networking-multiple-cidr_{context}"]
==== Define multiple CIDR blocks for one network security group (NSG) rule

With this release, IP addresses and ranges are handled more efficiently in NSGs for {product-title} clusters hosted on Azure. As a result, the maximum limit of CIDRs for all Ingress Controllers in Azure clusters, using the `allowedSourceRanges` field, increases from approximately 1000 to 4000 CIDRs.

[id="ocp-4-16-sdn-ovnk-migration-nutanix-support_{context}"]
==== Migration from OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes on Nutanix

With this release, migration from the OpenShift SDN network plugin to OVN-Kubernetes is now supported on Nutanix platforms. For more information, see xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/migrate-from-openshift-sdn.adoc#nw-ovn-kubernetes-migration-about_migrate-from-openshift-sdn[Migration to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin].

[id="ocp-4-16-coredns-improved-egress-firewall_{context}"]
==== Improved integration between CoreDNS and egress firewall (Technology Preview)

With this release, OVN-Kubernetes uses a new `DNSNameResolver` custom resource to keep track of DNS records in your egress firewall rules, and is available as a Technology Preview. This custom resource supports the use of both wildcard DNS names and regular DNS names and allows access to DNS names regardless of the IP addresses associated with its change.

[id="ocp-4-16-networking-sriov-draining_{context}"]
==== Parallel node draining during SR-IOV network policy updates

With this update, you can configure the SR-IOV Network Operator to drain nodes in parallel during network policy updates. The option to drain nodes in parallel enables faster rollouts of SR-IOV network configurations. You can use the `SriovNetworkPoolConfig` custom resource to configure parallel node draining and define the maximum number of nodes in the pool that the Operator can drain in parallel.

For further information, see xref:../networking/hardware_networks/configuring-sriov-device.adoc#configure-sr-iov-operator-parallel-nodes_configuring-sriov-device[Configuring parallel node draining during SR-IOV network policy updates].

[id="ocp-4-16-networking-create-sriovoperatorconfig_{context}"]

[id="ocp-4-16-q-in-q-support"]
==== Supporting double-tagged packets (QinQ)

This release introduces 802.1Q-in-802.1Q also known as QinQ support. QinQ introduces a second VLAN tag, where the service provider designates the outer tag for their use, offering them flexibility, while the inner tag remains dedicated to the customer’s VLAN. When two VLAN tags are present in a packet, the outer VLAN tag can be either 802.1Q or 802.1ad. The inner VLAN tag must always be 802.1Q.

For more information, see xref:../networking/hardware_networks/configuring-sriov-qinq-support.adoc#configuring-qinq-support[Configuring QinQ support for SR-IOV enabled workloads].

[id="ocp-4-16-networking-user-managed-lb_{context}"]
==== Configuring a user-managed load balancer for on-premise infrastructure

With this release, you can configure an {product-title} cluster on any on-premise infrastructure, such as bare-metal, {vmw-first}, {rh-openstack-first}, or Nutanix, to use a user-managed load balancer in place of the default load balancer. For this configuration, you must specify `loadBalancer.type: UserManaged` in your cluster’s `install-config.yaml` file.

For more information about this feature on bare-metal infrastructure, see xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-installation-workflow.adoc#nw-osp-services-external-load-balancer_ipi-install-installation-workflow[Services for a user-managed load balancer] in _Setting up the environment for an OpenShift installation_.

[id="ocp-4-16-detect-warning-for-iptables_{context}"]
[id="ocp-4-16-detect-warning-for-iptables"]
==== Detect and warning for iptables
With this release, if you have pods in your cluster using `iptables` rules the following event message is given to warn against future deprecation:
`This pod appears to have created one or more iptables rules. IPTables is deprecated and will no longer be available in RHEL 10 and later. You should consider migrating to another API such as nftables or eBPF.`

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/configuring_firewalls_and_packet_filters/getting-started-with-nftables_firewall-packet-filters#doc-wrapper[Getting started with nftables]. If you are running third-party software, check with your vendor to ensure they will have an `nftables` based version available soon.

[id="ocp-4-16-networking-ingress-network-flow_{context}"]
==== Ingress network flows for {product-title} services

With this release, you can view the ingress network flows for {product-title} services. You can use this information to manage ingress traffic for your network and improve network security.

For more information, see xref:../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#network-flow-matrix_configuring-firewall[{product-title} network flow matrix].

[id="ocp-4-16-networking-pathing-existing-dual-stack"]
==== Patching an existing dual-stack network

With this release, you can add IPv6 virtual IPs (VIPs) for API and Ingress services to an existing dual-stack-configured cluster by patching the cluster infrastructure.

If you have already upgraded your cluster to {product-title} {product-version} and you need to convert the single-stack cluster network to a dual-stack cluster network, you must specify the following for your cluster in the YAML configuration patch file:

* An IPv4 network for API and Ingress services on the first `machineNetwork` configuration.
* An IPv6 network for API and Ingress services on the second `machineNetwork` configuration.

For more information, see xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/converting-to-dual-stack.adoc#nw-dual-stack-convert_converting-to-dual-stack[Converting to a dual-stack cluster network] in _Converting to IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack networking_.

[id="ocp-4-16-networking-metallb-frr-k8s_{context}"]
==== Integration of MetalLB and FRR-K8s (Technology Preview)

This release introduces `FRR-K8s`, a Kubernetes based `DaemonSet` that exposes a subset of the `FRR` API in a Kubernetes-compliant manner.
As a cluster administrator, you can use the `FRRConfiguration` custom resource (CR) to configure the MetalLB Operator to use the `FRR-K8s` daemon set as the backend.
You can use this to operate FRR services, such as receiving routes.

For more information, see xref:../networking/metallb/metallb-frr-k8s.adoc#metallb-configure-frr-k8s[Configuring the integration of MetalLB and FRR-K8s].

[id="ocp-4-16-anp"]
=== AdminNetworkPolicy is generally available
This feature provides two new APIs, `AdminNetworkPolicy` (ANP) and `BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy` (BANP). Before namespaces are created, cluster Administrators can use ANP and BANP to apply cluster-scoped network policies and safeguards for an entire cluster. Because it is cluster scoped, ANP provides Administrators a solution to manage the security of their network at scale without having to duplicate their network policies on each namespace.

For more information, see xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/converting-to-dual-stack.adoc#nw-dual-stack-convert_converting-to-dual-stack[Converting to a dual-stack cluster network] in _Converting to IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack networking_.

[id="ocp-4-16-networking-sdn-ovnk-live-migration_{context}"]
==== Live migration to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin

Previously, when migrating from OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes, the only available option was an _offline_ migration method. This process included some downtime, during which clusters were unreachable.

This release introduces a _live_ migration method. The live migration method is the process in which the OpenShift SDN network plugin and its network configurations, connections, and associated resources are migrated to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin without service interruption. It is available for {product-title}, {product-dedicated}, {product-rosa}, and Azure Red Hat OpenShift deployment types. It is not available for HyperShift deployment types. This migration method is valuable for deployment types that require constant service availability and offers the following benefits:

* Continuous service availability

* Minimized downtime

* Automatic node rebooting

* Seamless transition from the OpenShift SDN network plugin to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin

Migration to OVN-Kubernetes is intended to be a one-way process.

For more information, see xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/migrate-from-openshift-sdn.adoc#nw-ovn-kubernetes-live-migration-about_migrate-from-openshift-sdn[Live migration to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin overview].

{product-title} 4.16 introduces volume cloning for the Microsoft Azure File Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver Operator as a Technology Preview feature. Volume cloning duplicates an existing persistent volume (PV) to help protect against data loss in {product-title}. You can also use a volume clone just as you would use any standard volume.

For more information, see xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-azure-file.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-azure-file[Azure File CSI Driver Operator] and xref:..//storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-cloning.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-cloning[CSI volume cloning].

[id="ocp-4-16-storage-node-expansion-secret"]
==== Node Expansion Secret is generally available
The Node Expansion Secret feature allows your cluster to expand storage of mounted volumes, even when access to those volumes requires a secret (for example, a credential for accessing a Storage Area Network (SAN) fabric) to perform the node expand operation. {product-title} 4.16 supports this feature as generally available.

[id="ocp-4-16-vsphere-max-snapshot"]
==== Changing vSphere CSI maximum number of snapshots is generally available
The default maximum number of snapshots in VMWare vSphere Container Storage Interface (CSI) is 3 per volume. In {product-title} 4.16, you can now change this maximum number of snapshots to a maximum of 32 per volume. You also have granular control of the maximum number of snapshots for vSAN and Virtual Volume datastores. {product-title} 4.16 supports this feature as generally available.

For more information, see xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-vsphere.adoc#vsphere-change-max-snapshot_persistent-storage-csi-vsphere[Changing the maximum number of snapshots for vSphere].

[id="ocp-4-16-pv-last-phase-transition-time"]
==== Persistent volume last phase transition time parameter (Technology Preview)
In {product-title} 4.16 introduces a new parameter, `LastPhaseTransitionTime`, which has a timestamp that is updated every time a persistent volume (PV) transitions to a different phase (`pv.Status.Phase`). This feature is being released with Technology Preview status.

[id="ocp-4-16-storage-csi-smb-cifs-driver-operator"]
==== Persistent storage using CIFS/SMB CSI Driver Operator (Technology Preview)
{Product-title} is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) with a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for the Common Internet File System (CIFS) dialect/Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. The CIFS/SMB CSI Driver Operator that manages this driver is in Technology Preview status.

For more information, see xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-smb-cifs.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-smb-cifs[CIFS/SMB CSI Driver Operator].

[id="ocp-4-16-storage-rwop-selinux-context-mode"]
==== RWOP with SELinux context mount is generally available
{product-title} 4.14 introduced a new access mode with Technical Preview status for persistent volumes (PVs) and persistent volume claims (PVCs) called ReadWriteOncePod (RWOP). RWOP can be used only in a single pod on a single node compared to the existing ReadWriteOnce access mode where a PV or PVC can be used on a single node by many pods. If the driver enables it, RWOP uses the SELinux context mount set in the `PodSpec` or container, which allows the driver to mount the volume directly with the correct SELinux labels. This eliminates the need to recursively relabel the volume, and pod startup can be significantly faster.

In {product-title} 4.16, this feature is generally available.

For more information, see xref:../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#pv-access-modes_understanding-persistent-storage[Access modes].

[id="ocp-4-16-storage-csi-vsphere-compliance-check"]
==== vSphere CSI Driver 3.1 updated CSI topology requirements
To support VMware vSphere Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume provisioning and usage in multi-zonal clusters, the deployment should match certain requirements imposed by CSI driver. These requirements have changed starting with 3.1.0, and although {product-title} 4.16 accepts both the old and new tagging methods, you should use the new tagging method since VMware considers the old way an invalid configuration; thus to prevent problems, you should not use the old tagging method.

For more information, see xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-vsphere.adoc#vsphere-csi-topology-requirements[vSphere CSI topology requirements].

[id="ocp-4-16-oci"]

[id="ocp-4-16-storage-thick-provisioning_{context}"]
==== Support for configuring thick-provisioned storage

This feature provides support for configuring thick-provisioned storage. If you exclude the `deviceClasses.thinPoolConfig` field in the `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR), logical volumes are thick provisioned.
Using thick-provisioned storage includes the following limitations:

* No copy-on-write support for volume cloning.
* No support for `VolumeSnapshotClass`. Therefore, CSI snapshotting is not supported.
* No support for over-provisioning. As a result, the provisioned capacity of PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) is immediately reduced from the volume group.
* No support for thin metrics. Thick-provisioned devices only support volume group metrics.

For information about configuring the `LVMCluster` CR, see xref:../storage/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_local/persistent-storage-using-lvms.adoc#about-lvmcluster_logical-volume-manager-storage[About the LVMCluster custom resource].

[id="ocp-4-16-storage-no-deviceselector-warning-message_{context}"]
==== Support for a new warning message when device selector is not configured in the LVMCluster custom resource

This update provides a new warning message when you do not configure the `deviceSelector` field in the `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR).

The `LVMCluster` CR supports a new field, `deviceDiscoveryPolicy`, which indicates whether the `deviceSelector` field is configured. If you do not configure the `deviceSelector` field, {lvms} automatically sets the `deviceDiscoveryPolicy` field to `RuntimeDynamic`. Otherwise, the `deviceDiscoveryPolicy` field is set to `Preconfigured`.

It is not recommended to exclude the `deviceSelector` field from the `LMVCluster` CR. For more information about the limitations of not configuring the `deviceSelector` field, see xref:../storage/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_local/persistent-storage-using-lvms.adoc#about-adding-devices-to-a-vg_logical-volume-manager-storage[About adding devices to a volume group].

[id="ocp-4-16-storage-adding-encrypted-devices-to-vg_{context}"]
==== Support for adding encrypted devices to a volume group

This feature provides support for adding encrypted devices to a volume group. You can enable disk encryption on the cluster nodes during an {product-title} installation. After encrypting a device, you can specify the path to the LUKS encrypted device in the `deviceSelector` field in the `LVMCluster` custom resource. For information about disk encryption, xref:../installing/install_config/installing-customizing.adoc#installation-special-config-encrypt-disk_installing-customizing[About disk encryption] and xref:../installing/install_config/installing-customizing.adoc#installation-special-config-storage-procedure_installing-customizing[Configuring disk encryption and mirroring].

==== Garbage collection of unused rendered machine configs

With this release, you can now garbage collect unused rendered machine configs. By using the `oc adm prune renderedmachineconfigs` command, you can view the unused rendered machine configs, determine which to remove, then batch delete the rendered machine configs that you no longer need. Having too many machine configs can make working with the machine configs confusing and can also contribute to disk space and performance issues.

[id="ocp-4-16-machine-config-operator-node-disruption_{context}"]
==== Node disruption policies

By default, when you make certain changes to the parameters in a `MachineConfig` object, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) drains and reboots the nodes associated with that machine config. However, you can create a node disruption policy in the MCO namespace that defines a set of Ignition config objects changes that would require little or no disruption to your workloads.

[id="ocp-4-16-machine-config-operator-on-cluster_{context}"]
==== On-cluster {op-system} image layering

With {op-system-first} image layering, you can now automatically build the custom layered image directly in your cluster, as a Technology Preview feature. Previously, you needed to build the custom layered image outside of the cluster, then pull the image into the cluster. The image layering feature allows you to extend the functionality of your base {op-system} image by layering additional images onto the base image. For more information, see xref:../post_installation_configuration/coreos-layering.adoc#coreos-layering[RHCOS image layering].

[id="ocp-4-16-machine-config-operator-boot-image_{context}"]
==== Updating boot images

By default, the MCO does not delete the boot image it uses to bring up a {op-system-first} node. Consequently, the boot image in your cluster is not updated along with your cluster. You can now configure your cluster to update the boot image whenever you update your cluster.

The Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator (VPA) consists of three components: the recommender, updater, and admission controller. The Operator and each component has its own pod in the VPA namespace on the control plane nodes. You can move the VPA Operator and component pods to infrastructure or worker nodes.

[id="ocp-4-16-must-gather-directory_{context}"]
==== Additional information collected by must-gather

With this release, the `oc adm must-gather` command collects the following additional information:

* OpenShift CLI (`oc`) binary version
* Must-gather logs

These additions help identify issues that might stem from using a specific version of `oc`. The `oc adm must-gather` command also lists what image was used and if any data could not be gathered in the must-gather logs.

[id="ocp-4-16-upgrading-or-downgrading-host-firmware_{context}"]
==== Upgrading or downgrading host firmware

Beginning with {product-title} {product-version}, you can upgrade or downgrade the firmware for a bare-metal node to a specific version. Metal^3^ provides the `HostFirmwareComponents` resource, which describes BIOS and baseboard management controller (BMC) firmware versions. Upgrading or downgrading firmware is useful when deploying an {product-title} cluster on bare metal with validated patterns that have been tested against specific firmware versions. See xref:../post_installation_configuration/bare-metal-configuration.adoc#about-the-hostfirmwarecomponents-resource_post-install-bare-metal-configuration[About the HostFirmwareComponents resource] for additional details.

[id="ocp-4-16-editing-the-baremetalhost-resource_{context}"]
==== Editing the BareMetalHost resource

In {product-title} {product-version} and later, you can edit the baseboard management controller (BMC) address in the `BareMetalHost` resource of a bare-metal node. The node must be in the `Provisioned`, `ExternallyProvisioned`, `Registering`, or `Available` state. Editing the BMC address in the `BareMetalHost` resource will not result in deprovisioning the node. See xref:../post_installation_configuration/bare-metal-configuration.adoc#editing-a-baremetalhost-resource_post-install-bare-metal-configuration[Editing a BareMetalHost resource] for additional details.

=== Scalability and performance

[id="workload-partitioning-enhancement_{context}"]
==== Workload partitioning enhancement
With this release, platform pods deployed with a workload annotation that includes both CPU limits and CPU requests will have the CPU limits accurately calculated and applied as a CPU quota for the specific pod. In prior releases, if a workload partitioned pod had both CPU limits and requests set, they were ignored by the webhook. The pod did not benefit from workload partitioning and was not locked down to specific cores. This update ensures the requests and limits are now interpreted correctly by the webhook.

[NOTE]
====
It is expected that if the values for CPU limits are different from the value for requests in the annotation, the CPU limits are taken as being the same as the requests.
====

For more information, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/enabling-workload-partitioning.adoc#enabling-workload-partitioning[Workload partitioning].

[id="ocp-4-16-nodes-cgroupv2-default_{context}"]
==== Linux Control Groups version 2 is now supported with the performance profile feature

Beginning with {product-title} 4.16, Control Groups version 2 (cgroup v2), also known as cgroup2 or cgroupsv2, is enabled by default for all new deployments, even when performance profiles are present.

Since {product-title} 4.14, cgroups v2 has been the default, but the performance profile feature required the use of cgroups v1. This issue has been resolved.

cgroup v1 is still used in upgraded clusters with performance profiles that have initial installation dates before {product-title} 4.16. cgroup v1 can still be used in the current version by changing the `cgroupMode` field in the `node.config` object to `v1`.

For more information, see xref:../nodes/clusters/nodes-cluster-cgroups-2.adoc#nodes-clusters-cgroups-2[Configuring the Linux cgroup version on your nodes].

[id="ocp-4-16-etcd-increase-db-size_{context}"]
==== Support for increasing the etcd database size (Technology Preview)

With this release, you can increase the disk quota in etcd. This is a Technology Preview feature. For more information, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/recommended-performance-scale-practices/recommended-etcd-practices.adoc#etcd-increase-db_recommended-etcd-practices[Increasing the database size for etcd].

[id="ocp-4-16-reserved-core-freq-tuning_{context}"]
====  Reserved core frequency tuning

With this release, the Node Tuning Operator supports setting CPU frequencies in the `PerformanceProfile` for reserved and isolated core CPUs.
This is an optional feature that you can use to define specific frequencies.
The Node Tuning Operator then sets those frequencies by enabling the `intel_pstate` CPUFreq driver in the Intel hardware.
You must follow Intel's recommendations on frequencies for FlexRAN-like applications, which require the default CPU frequency to be set to a lower value than the default running frequency.

[id="ocp-4-16-node-tuning-operator-intel_{context}"]
====  Node Tuning Operator intel_pstate driver default setting

Previously, for the RAN DU-profile, setting the `realTime` workload hint to `true` in the `PerformanceProfile` always disabled the `intel_pstate`.
With this release, the Node Tuning Operator detects the underlying Intel hardware using `TuneD` and appropriately sets the `intel_pstate` kernel parameter based on the processor’s generation.
This decouples the `intel_pstate` from the `realTime` and `highPowerConsumption` workload hints.
The `intel_pstate` now depends only on the underlying processor generation.

For pre-IceLake processors, the `intel_pstate` is deactivated by default, whereas for IceLake and later generation processors, the `intel_pstate` is set to `active`.

[id="ocp-4-16-edge-computing_pg-ztp-rhacm_{context}"]
==== Using {rh-rhacm} PolicyGenerator resources to manage {ztp} cluster policies (Technology Preview)

You can now use `PolicyGenerator` resources and {rh-rhacm-first} to deploy polices for managed clusters with {ztp}.
The `PolicyGenerator` API is part of the link:https://open-cluster-management.io/[Open Cluster Management] standard and provides a generic way of patching resources which is not possible with the `PolicyGenTemplate` API.
Using `PolicyGenTemplate` resources to manage and deploy polices will be deprecated in an upcoming OpenShift Container Platform release.

For more information, see xref:../edge_computing/policygenerator_for_ztp/ztp-configuring-managed-clusters-policygenerator.adoc#ztp-configuring-managed-clusters-policygenerator[Configuring managed cluster policies by using PolicyGenerator resources].

[NOTE]

The `PolicyGenerator` API does not currently support merging patches with custom Kubernetes resources that contain lists of items. For example, in `PtpConfig` CRs.
====

[id="ocp-4-16-edge-computing-talm-enfore-policies_{context}"]
==== {cgu-operator} policy remediation

With this release, {cgu-operator-first} uses a {rh-rhacm-first} feature to remediate `inform` policies on managed clusters. This enhancement removes the need for the Operator to create `enforce` copies of `inform` policies during policy remediation. This enhancement also reduces the workload on the hub cluster due to copied policies, and can reduce the overall time required to remediate policies on managed clusters.

For more information, see xref:../edge_computing/cnf-talm-for-cluster-upgrades.adoc#talo-policies-concept_cnf-topology-aware-lifecycle-manager[Update policies on managed clusters].

[id="ocp-4-16-edge-computing-accelerated-ztp_{context}"]
==== Accelerated provisioning of {ztp} (Technology Preview)

With this release, you can reduce the time taken for cluster installation by using accelerated provisioning of {ztp} for {sno}.
Accelerated ZTP speeds up installation by applying Day 2 manifests derived from policies at an earlier stage.

The benefits of accelerated provisioning of {ztp} increase with the scale of your deployment.
Full acceleration gives more benefit on a larger number of clusters.
With a smaller number of clusters, the reduction in installation time is less significant.

[id="egress-ip-etp-local-support_{context}"]
=== Support for EgressIP with ExternalTrafficPolicy=Local services

Previously, it was unsupported for EgressIP selected pods to also serve as backends for services with `externalTrafficPolicy` set to `Local`. When attempting this configuration, service ingress traffic reaching the pods was incorrectly rerouted to the egress node hosting the EgressIP. This affected how responses to incoming service traffic connections were handled and led to non-functional services when `externalTrafficPolicy` was set to `Local`, as connections were dropped and the service became unavailable.

With {product-title} {product-version}, OVN-Kubernetes now supports the use of `ExternalTrafficPolicy=Local` services and EgressIP configurations at the same time on the same set of selected pods. OVN-Kubernetes now only reroutes the traffic originating from the EgressIP pods towards the egress node while routing the responses to ingress service traffic from the EgressIP pods via the same node where the pod is located.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-16-olm-ce-rename_{context}"]
=== Operator API renamed to ClusterExtension

Earlier Technology Preview phases of {olmv1-first} introduced a new `Operator` API, provided as `operator.operators.operatorframework.io` by the Operator Controller component. In {product-title} 4.16, this API is renamed `ClusterExtension`, provided as `clusterextension.olm.operatorframework.io`, for this Technology Preview phase of {olmv1}.

This API still streamlines management of installed extensions, which includes Operators via the `registry+v1` bundle format, by consolidating user-facing APIs into a single object. The rename to `ClusterExtension` addresses the following:

* More accurately reflects the simplified functionality of extending a cluster's capabilities
* Better represents a more flexible packaging format
* `Cluster` prefix clearly indicates that `ClusterExtension` objects are cluster-scoped, a change from {olmv0} where Operators could be either namespace-scoped or cluster-scoped

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-16-legacy-sa-tokens_{context}"]
=== Legacy service account API token secrets are no longer generated for each service account

Prior to {product-title} 4.16, when the integrated {product-registry} was enabled, a legacy service account API token secret was generated for every service account in the cluster. Starting with {product-title} 4.16, when the integrated {product-registry} is enabled, the legacy service account API token secret is no longer generated for each service account.

Additionally, when the integrated {product-registry} is enabled, the image pull secret generated for every service account no longer uses a legacy service account API token. Instead, the image pull secret now uses a bound service account token that is automatically refreshed before it expires.

For more information, see xref:../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-secrets.adoc#auto-generated-sa-token-secrets_nodes-pods-secrets[Automatically generated image pull secrets].

For information about detecting legacy service account API token secrets that are in use in your cluster or deleting them if they are not needed, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase article link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7058801[Long-lived service account API tokens in OpenShift Container Platform].

[id="ocp-4-14-nodes-cgroupv1-deprecated_{context}"]
==== Linux Control Groups version 1 is now deprecated

In {op-system-base-full} 9, the default mode is cgroup v2. When {op-system-base-full} 10 is released, systemd will not support booting in the cgroup v1 mode and only cgroup v2 mode will be available. As such, cgroup v1 is deprecated in {product-title} 4.16 and later. cgroup v1 will be removed in a future {product-title} release.

[id="ocp-4-16-deprecation-samples-operator_{context}"]
==== Cluster Samples Operator

The Cluster Samples Operator is deprecated with the {product-title} 4.16 release. The Cluster Samples Operator will stop managing and providing support to the non-S2I samples (image streams and templates). No new templates, samples or non-Source-to-Image (Non-S2I) image streams will be added to the Cluster Samples Operator. However, the existing S2I builder image streams and templates will continue to receive updates until the Cluster Samples Operator is removed in a future release.

[id="ocp-4-16-rhel-worker-nodes-deprecation_{context}"]
==== Package-based {op-system-base} compute machines

==== Cloud Credential Operator

* Previously, the Cloud Credential Operator was missing some permissions required to create a private cluster on {azure-first}.
These missing permissions prevented installation of an {azure-short} private cluster using {entra-first}.
This release includes the missing permissions and enables installation of an {azure-short} private cluster using {entra-short}.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-25193[*OCPBUGS-25193*])

* Previously, a bug caused the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) to report an incorrect mode in the metrics. Even though the cluster was in the default mode, the metrics reported that it was in the credentials removed mode. This update uses a live client in place of a cached client so that it is able to obtain the root credentials, and the CCO no longer reports an incorrect mode in the metrics. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-26488[*OCPBUGS-26488*])

* Previously, the Cloud Credential Operator credentials mode metric on an {product-title} cluster that uses {entra-first} reported using manual mode.
With this release, clusters that use {entra-short} are updated to report that they are using manual mode with pod identity.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-27446[*OCPBUGS-27446*])

* Previously, creating an {aws-first} root secret on a bare metal cluster caused the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) pod to crash.
The issue is resolved in this release.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-28535[*OCPBUGS-28535*])

* Previously, removing the root credential from a {gcp-first} cluster that used the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) in mint mode caused the CCO to become degraded after approximately one hour.
In a degraded state, the CCO cannot manage the component credential secrets on a cluster.
The issue is resolved in this release.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-28787[*OCPBUGS-28787*])

* Previously, the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) checked for a nonexistent `s3:HeadBucket` permission during installation on {aws-first}.
When the CCO failed to find this permission, it considered the provided credentials insufficient for mint mode.
With this release, the CCO no longer checks for the nonexistent permission.

[id="ocp-4-16-cluster-version-operator-bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== Cluster Version Operator

* This release expands the `ClusterOperatorDown` and `ClusterOperatorDegraded` alerts to cover ClusterVersion conditions and send alerts for `Available=False` (`ClusterOperatorDown`) and `Failing=True` (`ClusterOperatorDegraded`). In previous releases, those alerts only covered ClusterOperator conditions. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-9133[*OCPBUGS-9133*])

* Previously, Cluster Version Operator (CVO) changes that were introduced in {product-title} 4.15.0, 4.14.0, 4.13.17, and 4.12.43 caused failing risk evaluations to block the CVO from fetching new update recommendations. When the risk evaluations failed, the bug caused the CVO to overlook the update recommendation service. With this release, the CVO continues to poll the update recommendation service, regardless of whether update risks are being successfully evaluated and the issue has been resolved.

* Previously, the API documentation for the `status.componentRoutes.currentHostnames` field in the Ingress API included developer notes. After you entered the `oc explain ingresses.status.componentRoutes.currentHostnames --api-version=config.openshift.io/v1` command, developer notes would show in the output along with the intended information. With this release, the developer notes are removed from the `status.componentRoutes.currentHostnames` field, so that after you enter the command, the output lists current hostnames used by the route. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31058[*OCPBUGS-31058*])

* Previously, the load balancing algorithm did not differentiate between active and inactive services when determining weights, and it employed a random algorithm excessively in environments with many inactive services or environments routing backends with weight `0`. This led to increased memory usage and a higher risk of excessive memory consumption. With this release, changes optimize traffic direction towards active services only and prevent unnecessary use of a random algorithm with higher weights, reducing the potential for excessive memory consumption. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29690[*OCPBUGS-29690*])

* Previously, if multiple routes were specified in the same certificate or if a route specified the default certificate as a custom certificate, and HTTP/2 was enabled on the router, an HTTP/2 client could perform connection coalescing on routes. Clients, such as a web browser, could re-use connections and potentially connect to the wrong backend server. With this release, the {product-title} router now checks when the same certificate is specified on more than one route or when a route specifies the default certificate as a custom certificate. When either one of these conditions is detected, the router configures the HAProxy load balancer so to not allow HTTP/2 client connections to any routes that use these certificate.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29373[*OCPBUGS-29373*])

* Previously, if you configured a deployment with the `routingViaHost` parameter set to `true`, traffic failed to reach the IPv6 `ExternalTrafficPolicy=Local` load balancer service. With this release, the issue is fixed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-27211[*OCPBUGS-27211*])

* Previously, a pod selected by an `EgressIp` object that was hosted on a secondary network interface controller (NIC) caused connections to node IP addresses to timeout. With this release, the issue is fixed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-26979[*OCPBUGS-26979*])

* Previously, a leap file package that the {product-title} Precision Time Protocol (PTP) Operator installed could not be used by the `ts2phc` process because the package expired. With this release, the leap file package is updated to read leap events from Global Positioning System (GPS) signals and update the offset dynamically so that the expired package situation no longer occurs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-25939[*OCPBUGS-25939*])

* Previously, pods assigned an IP from the pool created by the Whereabouts CNI plugin were getting stuck in the `ContainerCreating` state after a node forced a reboot. With this release, the Whereabouts CNI plugin issue associated with the IP allocation after a node force reboot is resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-24608[*OCPBUGS-24608*])

* Previously, there was a conflict between two scripts on {product-title} in IPv6, including single and dual-stack, deployments. One script set the hostname to a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) but the other script might set it to a short name too early. This conflict happened because the event that triggered setting the hostname to FQDN might run after the script that set it to a short name. This occurred due to asynchronous network events. With this release, new code has been added to ensure that the FQDN is set properly. This new code ensures that there is a wait for a specific network event before allowing the hostname to be set. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-22324[*OCPBUGS-22324*])

* Previously, if a pod selected by an `EgressIP` through a secondary interface had its label removed, another pod in the same namespace would also lose its `EgressIP` assignment, breaking its connection to the external host. With this release, the issue is fixed, so that when a pod label is removed and it stops using the `EgressIP`, other pods with the matching label continue to use the `EgressIP` without interruption. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-20220[*OCPBUGS-20220*])

* Previously, `EgressIP` pods hosted by a secondary interface would not failover because of a race condition. Users would receive an error message indicating that the `EgressIP` pod could not be assigned because it conflicted with an existing IP address. With this update, the `EgressIP` pod moves to an egress node. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-20209[*OCPBUGS-20209*])

* Previously, when a MAC address changed on the physical interface being used by OVN-Kubernetes, it would not be updated correctly within OVN-Kubernetes and could cause traffic disruption and Kube API outages from the node for a prolonged period of time. This was most common when a bond interface was being used, where the MAC address of the bond might swap depending on which device was the first to come up. With this release, the issues if fixed so that OVN-Kubernetes dynamically detects MAC address changes and updates it correctly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18716[*OCPBUGS-18716*])

* Previously, the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) module was capable of reporting both the GPS `fix` position and the GNSS `offset` position, which represents the offset between the GNSS module and the constellations. The previous T-GM did not use the `ubloxtool` CLI tool to probe the `ublox` module for reading `offset` and `fix` positions. Instead, it could only read the GPS `fix` information via GPSD. The reason for this was that the previous implementation of the `ubloxtool` CLI tool took two seconds to receive a response, and with every call it increased CPU usage by threefold. With this update, the `ubloxtool` request is now optimized, and the GPS `offset` position is now available. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-17422[*OCPBUGS-17422*])

////
* Previously for {product-title} clusters on {azure-full} that used OVN-Kubernetes as the Container Network Interface (CNI), an issue existed where the source IP recognized by the pod was the OVN gateway router of the node when the load balancer service with `externalTrafficPolicy: Local` was used. This occurred due to a Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) being applied to UDP packets.
+
With this release, session affinity without a timeout is possible by setting the affinity timeout to a higher value, for example, `86400` seconds, or 24 hours. As a result, the affinity is treated as permanent unless there are network disruptions such as endpoints or nodes going down. As a result, session affinity is more persistent. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-24219[*OCPBUGS-24219*])
////

* Previously, IPv6 was unsupported when assigning an egress IP to a network interface that was not the primary network interface. This issue has been resolved, and the egress IP can be IPv6. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-24271[*OCPBUGS-24271*])

[id="ocp-4-16-olm-bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

* Previously, Operator catalogs were not being refreshed properly, due to the `imagePullPolicy` field being set to `IfNotPresent` for the index image. This bug fix updates {olm} to use the appropriate image pull policy for catalogs, and as a result catalogs are refreshed properly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-30132[*OCPBUGS-30132*])

* Previously, cluster upgrades could be blocked due to {olm} getting stuck in a `CrashLoopBackOff` state. This was due to an issue with resources having multiple owner references. This bug fix updates {olm} to avoid duplicate owner references and only validate the related resources that it owns. As a result, cluster upgrades can proceed as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-28744[*OCPBUGS-28744*])

* Previously, default {olm} catalog pods backed by a `CatalogSource` object would not survive an outage of the node that they were being run on. The pods remained in termination state, despite the tolerations that should move them. This caused Operators to no longer be able to be installed or updated from related catalogs. This bug fix updates {olm} so catalog pods that get stuck in this state are deleted. As a result, catalog pods now correctly recover from planned or unplanned node maintenance. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32183[*OCPBUGS-32183*])

* Previously, installing an Operator could sometimes fail if the same Operator had been previously installed and uninstalled. This was due to a caching issue. This bug fix updates {olm} to correctly install the Operator in this scenario, and as a result this issue no longer occurs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31073[*OCPBUGS-31073*])

* Previously, the catalogd component could crash loop after an etcd restore. This was due to the garbage collection process causing a looping failure state when the API server was unreachable. This bug fix updates catalogd to add a retry loop, and as a result catalogd no longer crashes in this scenario. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29453[*OCPBUGS-29453*])

* Previously, the default catalog source pod would not receive updates, requiring users to manually recreate it to get updates. This was caused by image IDs for catalog pods not getting detected correctly. This bug fix updates {olm} to correctly detect catalog pod image IDs, and as a result, default catalog sources are updated as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31438[*OCPBUGS-31438*])

* Previously, users could experience Operator installation errors due to {olm} not being able to find existing `ClusterRoleBinding` or `Service` resources and creating them a second time. This bug fix updates {olm} to pre-create these objects, and as a result these installation errors no longer occur. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-24009[*OCPBUGS-24009*])

[id="ocp-4-16-storage-bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== Storage

* Previously, some `LVMVolumeGroupNodeStatus` operands were not deleted on the cluster during the deletion of the `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR). With this release, deleting the `LVMCluster` CR triggers the deletion of all the `LVMVolumeGroupNodeStatus` operands. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32954[*OCPBUGS-32954*])

* Previously, {lvms} uninstallation was stuck waiting for the deletion of the `LVMVolumeGroupNodeStatus` operands. This fix corrects the behavior by ensuring all operands are deleted, allowing {lvms} to be uninstalled without delay. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32753[*OCPBUGS-32753*])

* Previously, {lvms} did not support minimum storage size for persistent volume claims (PVCs). This can lead to mount failures while provisioning PVCs. With this release, {lvms} supports minimum storage size for PVCs. The following are the minimum storage sizes that you can request for each file system type:

** `block`: 8 MiB
** `xfs`: 300 MiB
** `ext4`: 32 MiB
+
If the value of the `requests.storage` field in the `PersistentVolumeClaim` object is less than the minimum storage size, the requested storage size is rounded to the minimum storage size. If the value of the `limits.storage field` is less than the minimum storage size, PVC creation fails with an error. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-30266[*OCPBUGS-30266*])

* Previously, {lvms} created persistent volume claims (PVCs) with storage size requests that were not multiples of the disk sector size. This can cause issues during LVM2 volume creation. This fix corrects the behavior by rounding the storage size requested by PVCs to the nearest multiple of 512. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-30032[*OCPBUGS-30032*])

* Previously, the `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR) contained an excluded status element for a device that is set up correctly. This fix filters the correctly set device from being considered for an excluded status element, so it only appears in the ready devices.

== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.9 and beyond!
* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])

* {run-once-operator} (RODOO) cannot be installed on clusters managed by the Hypershift Operator. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-17533[*OCPBUGS-17533*])

* When you run Cloud-native Network Functions (CNF) latency tests on an {product-title} cluster, the `oslat` test can sometimes return results greater than 20 microseconds. This results in an `oslat` test failure.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-9279[*RHEL-9279*])

* For a bonding network interface that holds a `br-ex` bridge device, do not set the `mode=6 balance-alb` bond mode in a node network configuration. This bond mode is not supported on {product-title} and it can cause the Open vSwitch (OVS) bridge device to disconnect from your networking environment. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34430[*OCPBUGS-34430*]).

// HCIDOCS-365 - This issue should be fixed soon, in a 4.16.z release
* Do not update firmware for the `BareMetalHosts` (BMH) resource by editing the `HostFirmwareComponents` resource. Otherwise, the BMH remains in the `Preparing` state and executes the firmware update repeatedly. There is no workaround. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-35559[*OCPBUGS-35559*])

[id="ocp-telco-ran-4-16-known-issues_{context}"]
* The current PTP grandmaster clock (T-GM) implementation has a single National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) sentence generator sourced from the GNSS without a backup NMEA sentence generator.
If NMEA sentences are lost before reaching the e810 NIC, the T-GM cannot synchronize the devices in the network synchronization chain and the PTP Operator reports an error.
A proposed fix is to report a `FREERUN` event when the NMEA string is lost.
Until this limitation is addressed, T-GM does not support PTP clock holdover state.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-19838[*OCPBUGS-19838*])

[id="ocp-telco-core-4-16-known-issues_{context}"]

* When a worker node's Topology Manager policy is changed, the NUMA-aware secondary pod scheduler does not respect this change, which can result in incorrect scheduling decisions and unexpected topology affinity errors. As a workaround, restart the NUMA-aware scheduler by deleting the NUMA-aware scheduler pod. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34583[*OCPBUGS-34583*])

* Due to an issue with Kubernetes, the CPU Manager is unable to return CPU resources from the last pod admitted to a node to the pool of available CPU resources. These resources are allocatable if a subsequent pod is admitted to the node. However, this pod then becomes the last pod, and again, the CPU manager cannot return this pod's resources to the available pool.
+
This issue affects CPU load balancing features, which depend on the CPU Manager releasing CPUs to the available pool. Consequently, non-guaranteed pods might run with a reduced number of CPUs. As a workaround, schedule a pod with a `best-effort` CPU Manager policy on the affected node. This pod will be the last admitted pod and this ensures the resources will be correctly released to the available pool.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-17792[*OCPBUGS-17792*])

* After applying a `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` resource, the CA certificate might be replaced during SR-IOV Network Operator webhook reconciliation. As a consequence, you might see `unknown authority` errors when applying SR-IOV Network node policies. As a workaround, try to re-apply the failed policies. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32139[*OCPBUGS-32139*])

* If you delete a `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` resource for a virtual function with a `vfio-pci` driver type, the SR-IOV Network Operator is unable to reconcile the policy. As a consequence the `sriov-device-plugin` pod enters a continuous restart loop. As a workaround, delete all remaining policies affecting the physical function, then re-create them. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34934[*OCPBUGS-34934*])

[id="ocp-4-16-asynchronous-errata-updates_{context}"]
== Asynchronous errata updates

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for {product-title} {product-version} are released as asynchronous errata through the Red Hat Network. All {product-title} {product-version} errata is https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[available on the Red Hat Customer Portal]. See the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} Life Cycle] for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account settings for Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications are enabled, users are notified through email whenever new errata relevant to their registered systems are released.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming {product-title} entitlements for {product-title} errata notification emails to generate.
====

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of {product-title} {product-version}. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form {product-title} {product-version}.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any {product-title} release, always review the instructions on xref:../updating/updating_a_cluster/updating-cluster-web-console.adoc#updating-cluster-web-console[updating your cluster] properly.
