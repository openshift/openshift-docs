// Double check OP system versions
{product-title} {product-version} is supported on {op-system-base-full} 8.8 and 8.9, and on {op-system-first} 4.15.

You must use {op-system} machines for the control plane, and you can use either {op-system} or {op-system-base} for compute machines.
//Removed the note per https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GRPA-3517

//TODO: Add this for 4.14
Starting with {product-title} 4.12, an additional six months is added to the Extended Update Support (EUS) phase on even numbered releases from 18 months to two years. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

Starting with {product-title} 4.14, Extended Update Support (EUS) is extended to 64-bit ARM, {ibm-power-name} (ppc64le), and {ibm-z-name} (s390x) platforms. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift-eus[OpenShift EUS Overview].

//TODO: Add the line below for EUS releases and comment it out for non-EUS releases.
// {product-title} {product-version} is an Extended Update Support (EUS) release. More information on Red Hat OpenShift EUS is available in link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#ocp4_phases[OpenShift Life Cycle] and link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift-eus[OpenShift EUS Overview].

//TODO: The line below should be used when it is next appropriate. Revisit in August 2023 time frame.
Maintenance support ends for version 4.12 on 25 January 2025 and goes to extended life phase. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

Commencing with the {product-version} release, Red Hat is simplifying the administration and management of Red Hat shipped cluster Operators with the introduction of three new life cycle classifications; Platform Aligned, Platform Agnostic, and Rolling Stream. These life cycle classifications provide additional ease and transparency for cluster administrators to understand the life cycle policies of each Operator and form cluster maintenance and upgrade plans with predictable support boundaries. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/j/includes/session/scribe/?redirectTo=https%3A%2F%2Faccess.redhat.com%2Fsupport%2Fpolicy%2Fupdates%2Fopenshift_operators[OpenShift Operator Life Cycles].

// Added in 4.14. Language came directly from Kirsten Newcomer.
{product-title} is designed for FIPS. When running {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures.

For more information about the NIST validation program, see link:https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules[Cryptographic Module Validation Program]. For the latest NIST status for the individual versions of {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted for validation, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2918071#fips-140-2-and-fips-140-3-2[Compliance Activities and Government Standards].

For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

[id="ocp-4-16-new-features-and-enhancements"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

[id="ocp-4-16-rhcos"]
=== {op-system-first}

==== {op-system} now uses {op-system-base} 9.4

{op-system} now uses {op-system-base-full} 9.4 packages in {product-title} {product-version}. These packages ensure that your {product-title} instances receive the latest fixes, features, enhancements, hardware support, and driver updates. As an Extended Update Support (EUS) release, {product-title} 4.14 is excluded from this change and will continue to use {op-system-base} 9.2 EUS packages for the entirety of its lifecycle.

[id="ocp-4-16-openshift-cli"]
=== OpenShift CLI (oc)

[id="ocp-4-16-oc-adm-upgrade-status-tp"]
==== Introducing the `oc adm upgrade status` command (Technology Preview)

Previously, the `oc adm upgrade` command provided limited information about the status of a cluster update. This release adds the `oc adm upgrade status` command, which decouples status information from the `oc adm upgrade` command and provides specific information regarding a cluster update, including the status of the control plane and worker node updates.

[id="ocp-4-16-duplicate-short-name-warning"]
==== Warning for duplicate resource short names

With this release, if you query a resource by using its short name, the OpenShift CLI  (`oc`) returns a warning if more than one custom resource definition (CRD) with the same short name exists in the cluster.

.Example warning
[source,terminal]
----
Warning: short name "ex" could also match lower priority resource examples.test.com

[id="ocp-4-16-networking-multiple-cidr"]
==== Define multiple CIDR blocks for one network security group (NSG) rule

With this release, IP addresses and ranges are handled more efficiently in NSGs for {product-title} clusters hosted on Azure. As a result, the maximum limit of CIDRs for all Ingress Controllers in Azure clusters, using the `allowedSourceRanges` field, increases from approximately 1000 to 4000 CIDRs.

[id="ocp-4-16-sdn-ovnk-migration-nutanix-support"]
==== Migration from OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes on Nutanix

With this release, migration from the OpenShift SDN network plugin to OVN-Kubernetes is now supported on Nutanix platforms. For more information, see xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/migrate-from-openshift-sdn.adoc#nw-ovn-kubernetes-migration-about_migrate-from-openshift-sdn[Migration to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin].

[id="ocp-4-16-coredns-improved-egress-firewall"]
==== Improved integration between CoreDNS and egress firewall (Technology Preview)

With this release, OVN-Kubernetes uses a new `DNSNameResolver` custom resource to keep track of DNS records in your egress firewall rules, and is available as a Technology Preview. This custom resource supports the use of both wildcard DNS names and regular DNS names and allows access to DNS names regardless of the IP addresses associated with its change.

For more information, see xref:../networking/openshift_network_security/configuring-egress-firewall-ovn.adoc#nw-coredns-egress-firewall[Improved DNS resolution and resolving wildcard domain names].

[id="ocp-4-16-networking-sriov-draining"]
==== Parallel node draining during SR-IOV network policy updates

With this update, you can configure the SR-IOV Network Operator to drain nodes in parallel during network policy updates. The option to drain nodes in parallel enables faster rollouts of SR-IOV network configurations. You can use the `SriovNetworkPoolConfig` custom resource to configure parallel node draining and define the maximum number of nodes in the pool that the Operator can drain in parallel.

For further information, see xref:../networking/hardware_networks/configuring-sriov-device.adoc#configure-sr-iov-operator-parallel-nodes_configuring-sriov-device[Configuring parallel node draining during SR-IOV network policy updates].

=== Machine Config Operator

With this release, you can now garbage collect unused rendered machine configs. By using the `oc adm prune renderedmachineconfigs` command, you can view the unused rendered machine configs, determine which to remove, then batch delete the rendered machine configs you no longer need. Having too many machine configs can make working with the machine configs confusing and can also contribute to disk space and performance issues. For more information, see xref:../post_installation_configuration/machine-configuration-tasks.adoc#machineconfig-garbage-collect_post-install-machine-configuration-tasks[Managing unused rendered machine configs].

With this release, the cluster autoscaler can use the `LeastWaste`, `Priority`, and `Random` expanders.
You can configure these expanders to influence the selection of machine sets when scaling the cluster.
For more information, see xref:../machine_management/applying-autoscaling.adoc#configuring-clusterautoscaler_applying-autoscaling[Configuring the cluster autoscaler].

[id="ocp-4-16-capi-tp-vmw"]
==== Managing machines with the Cluster API for {vmw-full} (Technology Preview)

This release introduces the ability to manage machines by using the upstream Cluster API, integrated into {product-title}, as a Technology Preview for {vmw-full} clusters.
This capability is in addition or an alternative to managing machines with the Machine API.
For more information, see _Managing machines with the Cluster API_.

=== Nodes

[id="ocp-4-14-nodes-cgroupv2-default"]
==== Linux Control Groups version 2 is now generally available (GA)

Beginning with {product-title} 4.16, Control Groups version 2 (cgroup v2), also known as cgroup2 or cgroupsv2, is enabled by default for all new deployments, even when performance profiles are present. 

Since {product-title} 4.14, cgroups v2 has been the default, but the performance profile feature required the use of cgroups v1. This issue has been resolved.

cgroup v1 is still used in upgraded clusters with performance profiles that have initial installation dates before {product-title} 4.16. cgroup v1 can still be used in the current version by changing the `cgroupMode` field in the `node.config` object to `v1`.

For more information, see xref:../nodes/clusters/nodes-cluster-cgroups-2.adoc#nodes-clusters-cgroups-2[Configuring the Linux cgroup version on your nodes].

=== Network Observability Operator
The Network Observability Operator releases updates independently from the {product-title} minor version release stream. Updates are available through a single, Rolling Stream which is supported on all currently supported versions of {product-title} 4. Information regarding new features, enhancements, and bug fixes for the Network Observability Operator is found in the xref:../observability/network_observability/network-observability-operator-release-notes.adoc#network-observability-rn[Network Observability release notes].

[id="ocp-4-16-scalability-and-performance"]
=== Scalability and performance

[id="workload-partitioning-enhancement"]
==== Workload partitioning enhancement
With this release, platform pods deployed with a workload annotation that includes both CPU limits and CPU requests will have the CPU limits accurately calculated and applied as a CPU quota for the specific pod. In prior releases, if a workload partitioned pod had both CPU limits and requests set, they were ignored by the webhook. The pod did not benefit from workload partitioning and was not locked down to specific cores. This update ensures the requests and limits are now interpreted correctly by the webhook. 

[NOTE]
====
It is expected that if the values for CPU limits are different from the value for requests in the annotation, the CPU limits are taken as being the same as the requests.

=== Edge computing

[id="ocp-4-16-edge-computing-talm-enfore-policies"]
==== {cgu-operator} policy remediation

With this release, {cgu-operator-first} uses a {rh-rhacm-first} feature to remediate `inform` policies on managed clusters. This enhancement removes the need for the Operator to create `enforce` copies of `inform` policies during policy remediation. This enhancement also reduces the workload on the hub cluster due to copied policies, and can reduce the overall time required to remediate policies on managed clusters.

For more information, see xref:../edge_computing/cnf-talm-for-cluster-upgrades.adoc#talo-policies-concept_cnf-topology-aware-lifecycle-manager[Update policies on managed clusters].

== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.9 and beyond!
* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])

* {run-once-operator} (RODOO) cannot be installed on clusters managed by the Hypershift Operator. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-17533[*OCPBUGS-17533*])

====

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of {product-title} {product-version}. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form {product-title} {product-version}.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.

[IMPORTANT]
