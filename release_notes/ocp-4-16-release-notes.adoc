== About this release

// TODO: Update with the relevant information closer to release.
{product-title} (link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7198[RHSA-2023:7198]) is now available. This release uses link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.29.md[Kubernetes 1.29] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at https://console.redhat.com/openshift. With the {cluster-manager-first} application for {product-title}, you can deploy {product-title} clusters to either on-premises or cloud environments.

// Double check OP system versions
{product-title} {product-version} is supported on {op-system-base-full} 8.8 and 8.9, and on {op-system-first} 4.15.

You must use {op-system} machines for the control plane, and you can use either {op-system} or {op-system-base} for compute machines.
//Removed the note per https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GRPA-3517

For {product-title} 4.12 on `x86_64` architecture, Red Hat has added a 6-month Extended Update Support (EUS) phase that extends the total available lifecycle from 18 months to 24 months. For {product-title} 4.12 running on 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), and {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architectures, the EUS lifecycle remains at 18 months.

Starting with {product-title} 4.14, each EUS phase for even numbered releases on all supported architectures, including `x86_64`, 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), and {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architectures, has a total available lifecycle of 24 months.

Starting with {product-title} 4.14, Red Hat offers a 12-month additional EUS add-on, denoted as _Additional EUS Term 2_, that extends the total available lifecycle from 24 months to 36 months. The Additional EUS Term 2 is available on all architecture variants of {product-title}.

For more information about this support, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

//TODO: The line below should be used when it is next appropriate. Revisit in August 2023 time frame.
Maintenance support ends for version 4.12 on 25 January 2025 and goes to extended life phase. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

Commencing with the {product-version} release, Red Hat is simplifying the administration and management of Red Hat shipped cluster Operators with the introduction of three new life cycle classifications; Platform Aligned, Platform Agnostic, and Rolling Stream. These life cycle classifications provide additional ease and transparency for cluster administrators to understand the life cycle policies of each Operator and form cluster maintenance and upgrade plans with predictable support boundaries. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/j/includes/session/scribe/?redirectTo=https%3A%2F%2Faccess.redhat.com%2Fsupport%2Fpolicy%2Fupdates%2Fopenshift_operators[OpenShift Operator Life Cycles].

// Added in 4.14. Language came directly from Kirsten Newcomer.
{product-title} is designed for FIPS. When running {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures.

For more information about the NIST validation program, see link:https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules[Cryptographic Module Validation Program]. For the latest NIST status for the individual versions of {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted for validation, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2918071#fips-140-2-and-fips-140-3-2[Compliance Activities and Government Standards].

[id="ocp-4.16-multiarch-tuning-operator_{context}"]
==== Managing workloads on multi-architecture clusters by using the Multiarch Tuning Operator

In {product-title} {product-version}, you can manage workloads on multi-architecture clusters by using the Multiarch Tuning Operator. This Operator enhances the operational experience within multi-architecture clusters, and single-architecture clusters that are migrating to a multi-architecture compute configuration. It implements the `ClusterPodPlacementConfig` custom resource (CR) to support architecture-aware workload scheduling.

For more information, see "Managing workloads on multi-architecture clusters by using the Multiarch Tuning Operator".

// xref:../../post_installation_configuration/configuring-multi-arch-compute-machines/multiarch-tuning-operator.adoc#multiarch-tuning-operator[Managing workloads on multi-architecture clusters by using the Multiarch Tuning Operator].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Multiarch Tuning Operator is a Technology Preview feature only. It does not support clusters with restricted network scenarios.

[id="ocp-4-16-openshift-cli_{context}"]
=== OpenShift CLI (oc)

[id="ocp-4-16-oc-adm-upgrade-status-tp_{context}"]
==== Introducing the `oc adm upgrade status` command (Technology Preview)

Previously, the `oc adm upgrade` command provided limited information about the status of a cluster update. This release adds the `oc adm upgrade status` command, which decouples status information from the `oc adm upgrade` command and provides specific information regarding a cluster update, including the status of the control plane and worker node updates.

[id="ocp-4-16-duplicate-short-name-warning_{context}"]
==== Warning for duplicate resource short names

With this release, if you query a resource by using its short name, the OpenShift CLI  (`oc`) returns a warning if more than one custom resource definition (CRD) with the same short name exists in the cluster.

.Example warning
[source,terminal]
----
Warning: short name "ex" could also match lower priority resource examples.test.com
----

[id="ocp-4-16-interactive-flag_{context}"]
==== New flag to require confirmation when deleting resources (Technology Preview)

This release introduces a new `--interactive` flag for the `oc delete` command. When the `--interactive` flag is set to `true`, the resource is deleted only if the user confirms the deletion. This flag is available as a Technology Preview feature.

==== Define multiple CIDR blocks for one network security group (NSG) rule

With this release, IP addresses and ranges are handled more efficiently in NSGs for {product-title} clusters hosted on Azure. As a result, the maximum limit of CIDRs for all Ingress Controllers in Azure clusters, using the `allowedSourceRanges` field, increases from approximately 1000 to 4000 CIDRs.

[id="ocp-4-16-sdn-ovnk-migration-nutanix-support_{context}"]
==== Migration from OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes on Nutanix

With this release, migration from the OpenShift SDN network plugin to OVN-Kubernetes is now supported on Nutanix platforms. For more information, see xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/migrate-from-openshift-sdn.adoc#nw-ovn-kubernetes-migration-about_migrate-from-openshift-sdn[Migration to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin].

[id="ocp-4-16-coredns-improved-egress-firewall_{context}"]
==== Improved integration between CoreDNS and egress firewall (Technology Preview)

With this release, OVN-Kubernetes uses a new `DNSNameResolver` custom resource to keep track of DNS records in your egress firewall rules, and is available as a Technology Preview. This custom resource supports the use of both wildcard DNS names and regular DNS names and allows access to DNS names regardless of the IP addresses associated with its change.

For more information, see xref:../networking/openshift_network_security/configuring-egress-firewall-ovn.adoc#nw-coredns-egress-firewall[Improved DNS resolution and resolving wildcard domain names].

[id="ocp-4-16-networking-sriov-draining_{context}"]
==== Parallel node draining during SR-IOV network policy updates

With this update, you can configure the SR-IOV Network Operator to drain nodes in parallel during network policy updates. The option to drain nodes in parallel enables faster rollouts of SR-IOV network configurations. You can use the `SriovNetworkPoolConfig` custom resource to configure parallel node draining and define the maximum number of nodes in the pool that the Operator can drain in parallel.

For further information, see xref:../networking/hardware_networks/configuring-sriov-device.adoc#configure-sr-iov-operator-parallel-nodes_configuring-sriov-device[Configuring parallel node draining during SR-IOV network policy updates].

[id="ocp-4-16-q-in-q-support_{context}"]
[id="ocp-4-16-q-in-q-support"]
==== Supporting double-tagged packets (QinQ)

This release introduces 802.1Q-in-802.1Q also known as QinQ support. QinQ introduces a second VLAN tag, where the service provider designates the outer tag for their use, offering them flexibility, while the inner tag remains dedicated to the customer’s VLAN. When two VLAN tags are present in a packet, the outer VLAN tag can be either 802.1Q or 802.1ad. The inner VLAN tag must always be 802.1Q.

For more information, see xref:../networking/hardware_networks/configuring-sriov-qinq-support.adoc#configuring-qinq-support[Configuring QinQ support for SR-IOV enabled workloads].

[id="ocp-4-16-networking-user-managed-lb_{context}"]
==== Configuring a user-managed load balancer for on-premise infrastructure

With this release, you can configure an {product-title} cluster on any on-premise infrastructure, such as bare-metal, {vmw-first}, {rh-openstack-first}, or Nutanix, to use a user-managed load balancer in place of the default load balancer. For this configuration, you must specify `loadBalancer.type: UserManaged` in your cluster’s `install-config.yaml` file.

For more information about this feature on bare-metal infrastructure, see xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-installation-workflow.html#nw-osp-services-external-load-balancer_ipi-install-installation-workflow[Services for a user-managed load balancer] in _Setting up the environment for an OpenShift installation_.

[id="ocp-4-16-detect-warning-for-iptables_{context}"]
[id="ocp-4-16-detect-warning-for-iptables"]
==== Detect and warning for iptables
With this release, if you have pods in your cluster using `iptables` rules the following event message is given to warn against future deprecation:
`This pod appears to have created one or more iptables rules. IPTables is deprecated and will no longer be available in RHEL 10 and later. You should consider migrating to another API such as nftables or eBPF.`


For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/configuring_firewalls_and_packet_filters/getting-started-with-nftables_firewall-packet-filters#doc-wrapper[Getting started with nftables]. If you are running third-party software, check with your vendor to ensure they will have an `nftables` based version available soon.

=== Scalability and performance

[id="workload-partitioning-enhancement_{context}"]
==== Workload partitioning enhancement
With this release, platform pods deployed with a workload annotation that includes both CPU limits and CPU requests have the CPU limits accurately calculated and applied as a CPU quota for the specific pod. In earlier releases, if a workload partitioned pod had both CPU limits and requests set, they were ignored by the webhook. The pod did not benefit from workload partitioning and was not locked down to specific cores. This update ensures the requests and limits are now interpreted correctly by the webhook.

[NOTE]
====
It is expected that if the values for CPU limits are different from the value for requests in the annotation, the CPU limits are taken as being the same as the requests.
====

For more information, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/enabling-workload-partitioning.adoc#enabling-workload-partitioning[Workload partitioning].

[id="ocp-4-16-nodes-cgroupv2-default_{context}"]
==== Linux Control Groups version 2 is now supported with the performance profile feature

Beginning with {product-title} 4.16, Control Groups version 2 (cgroup v2), also known as cgroup2 or cgroupsv2, is enabled by default for all new deployments, even when performance profiles are present.

Since {product-title} 4.14, cgroups v2 has been the default, but the performance profile feature required the use of cgroups v1. This issue has been resolved.

cgroup v1 is still used in upgraded clusters with performance profiles that have initial installation dates before {product-title} 4.16. cgroup v1 can still be used in the current version by changing the `cgroupMode` field in the `node.config` object to `v1`.

For more information, see xref:../nodes/clusters/nodes-cluster-cgroups-2.adoc#nodes-clusters-cgroups-2[Configuring the Linux cgroup version on your nodes].

[id="ocp-4-16-edge-computing-talm-enfore-policies_{context}"]
==== {cgu-operator} policy remediation

With this release, {cgu-operator-first} uses a {rh-rhacm-first} feature to remediate `inform` policies on managed clusters. This enhancement removes the need for the Operator to create `enforce` copies of `inform` policies during policy remediation. This enhancement also reduces the workload on the hub cluster due to copied policies, and can reduce the overall time required to remediate policies on managed clusters.

For more information, see xref:../edge_computing/cnf-talm-for-cluster-upgrades.adoc#talo-policies-concept_cnf-topology-aware-lifecycle-manager[Update policies on managed clusters].

The Cluster Samples Operator is deprecated with the {product-title} 4.16 release. The Cluster Samples Operator will stop managing and providing support to the non-S2I samples (image streams and templates). No new templates, samples or non-Source-to-Image (Non-S2I) image streams will be added to the Cluster Samples Operator. However, the existing S2I builder image streams and templates will continue to receive updates until the Cluster Samples Operator is removed in a future release.

== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.9 and beyond!
* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])

* {run-once-operator} (RODOO) cannot be installed on clusters managed by the Hypershift Operator. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-17533[*OCPBUGS-17533*])

[id="ocp-4-16-asynchronous-errata-updates_{context}"]
== Asynchronous errata updates

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for {product-title} {product-version} are released as asynchronous errata through the Red Hat Network. All {product-title} {product-version} errata is https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[available on the Red Hat Customer Portal]. See the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} Life Cycle] for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account settings for Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications are enabled, users are notified through email whenever new errata relevant to their registered systems are released.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming {product-title} entitlements for {product-title} errata notification emails to generate.
====

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of {product-title} {product-version}. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form {product-title} {product-version}.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any {product-title} release, always review the instructions on xref:../updating/updating_a_cluster/updating-cluster-web-console.adoc#updating-cluster-web-console[updating your cluster] properly.
