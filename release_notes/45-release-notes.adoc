[id="new-features_{context}"]
== New features

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts:

[id="scanner-v4-ga_{context}"]
=== Scanner V4 is generally available

Scanner V4 is now generally available. It integrates the features of the StackRox Scanner and the upstream Clair V4 Scanner and provides the following improvements:

* *Consistent and accurate scanning*: Scanner V4 provides reliable vulnerability scan results across the entire Red{nbsp}Hat product ecosystem.
* *Expanded language and operating system support*:
** {product-title-short} now supports Golang for language vulnerability scanning.
** {product-title-short} now supports Oracle Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise, and Photon OS for operating system scanning.
* *Comprehensive vulnerability database source*: Scanner V4 uses link:https://osv.dev/[OSV.dev] as the vulnerability database source for all supported programming language packages.

For more details, see xref:../operating/examine-images-for-vulnerabilities.adoc#about-scanner-v4_examine-images-for-vulnerabilities[About {product-title-short} Scanner V4].

[id="vulnerability-management-v2-ga_{context}"]
=== Vulnerability Management 2.0 is generally available

With this release, Vulnerability Management 2.0 is generally available. Red{nbsp}Hat has consolidated all updates into a single, unified *Vulnerability Management* dashboard, providing an enhanced user experience with intuitive navigation.

* It includes persona-specific vulnerability management views. For example, the *Node CVEs* view shows only information about CVEs impacting the underlying CoreOS hosts. The team responsible for host updates can use that information to take targeted action.
* It provides actionable data to triage and remediate vulnerabilities efficiently.
* It includes enhanced *Exception management* workflows with audit capabilities.
* The default filter view now persists across user sessions.
* You can download comprehensive vulnerability on-demand reports scoped with collections.

[NOTE]
====
As part of this update, the *Risk Acceptance* workflow is replaced with *Exception Management*. When you upgrade to {product-title-short} 4.5, the following changes occur:

* Existing deferrals and false positive requests are migrated to *Exception Management*.
* Globally snoozed Image CVEs are migrated to create approved deferrals under *Exception Management*.
====

[id="compliance-updates_{context}"]
=== Compliance updates

This release includes the following updates to the *Compliance* view:

* You can integrate with an email server to send scheduled reports.
* You can now generate an on-demand report for any scan configuration. {product-title-short} can send it by email.
* You can filter scan results by profile so that you can focus on specific compliance standards.
* Profiles now include benchmark names, providing more context and clarity.
* Scan results now include control data associated with the benchmark, giving you a comprehensive view of your compliance posture.

[id="build-in-email-notifier-acscs_{context}"]
=== Built-in email notifier in {product-title-managed-short}

If you are using {rh-rhacscs-first}, you can use the new built-in email notifier to send email notifications without configuring a third-party email provider.

[id="roxctl-installation-github-action_{context}"]
=== `roxctl` installation GitHub action

The link:https://github.com/stackrox/roxctl-installer-action[roxctl-installer-action] GitHub action is now available. You can use it to install `roxctl` in your GitHub workflows and run `roxctl image check` and `roxctl image scan` commands in your CI pipelines.

[id="bring-your-own-pki_{context}"]
=== Bring your own PKI for signature verification

Before this release, you could verify image signatures against pre-configured keys only. With {product-title-short} 4.5, Red{nbsp}Hat has extended the image signature verification to include verifying certificates. This method is available in addition to verifying public keys, so that you can bring your own public key infrastructure (PKI) to verify signatures.

[id="build-time-network-policy-tools-updates_{context}"]
=== Build-time network policy tools updates

This release introduces an update to the `roxctl netpol generate` command.

* By default, the command uses port `53` for DNS connections.
* You can use the `--dnsport` option to override the default DNS port. If you are using {ocp}, you must always change the port when generating network policies with `roxctl` because {ocp} uses port `5353` by default. For example, `roxctl netpol generate --dnsport 5353 <other-options>`.

To simplify usage for {ocp} and other systems that use named ports, Red{nbsp}Hat plans to enhance the `--dnsport` option in a future release to accept strings and numbers. With that change, the generated network policy can use a named port, such as `dns`, instead of a specific port number, which is a more portable approach.

For more details, see xref:../cli/generating-build-time-network-policies.adoc#using-the-build-time-network-policy-generator_generating-build-time-network-policies[Generating build-time network policies].

[id="enhanced-acscs-experience_{context}"]
=== Enhanced {product-title-managed-short} experience

The {product-title-managed-short} experience on `console.redhat.com` is improved, making signing up for a trial and getting support easier.

[id="notable-technical-changes_{context}"]
== Notable technical changes

* For {product-title-short} Operator, Red{nbsp}Hat has added a label selector for caching configuration of secrets and config maps, resulting in a significant reduction in memory consumption, especially on large clusters. In testing, a 28% decrease was noted in memory usage on a new {ocp} cluster.

* The {product-title-short} Operator now adds a `app.stackrox.io/managed-by: operator` label to all Helm chart resources and secrets created by the operator, providing better organization and visibility.

* The {product-title-short} Operator increases the number of requests sent to the API server to retrieve the following types of secrets:
 ** Secrets that the Operator does not manage
 ** Secrets that do not match the cache label selector

* Scanner DB now runs on PostgreSQL 15, replacing the earlier version, PostgreSQL 12. Because the database is not persisted, no migration is required, and you can continue using the scanner without any additional steps.

* The Nexus and Red{nbsp}Hat registry integrations now attempt to pull manifest digests by using a HEAD request to `/v2/<name>/manifests/<reference>`. This change resolves an issue that previously resulted in an `unsupported digest algorithm error` when using Scanner V4. You can turn off this new behavior by setting the environment variable `ROX_ATTEMPT_MANIFEST_DIGEST` to `false`.

* {product-title-short} includes new policy categories, and some default policies are tagged with these new policy categories.

|====

* When `roxctl` CLI generates manifests for {ocp}, it now defaults to {ocp} 4.x instead of {ocp} 3.x.

* You can now delegate the Image scans triggered by image watch reprocessing based on the delegated scanning configuration. To turn off this feature, set the Central environment variable `ROX_DELEGATE_WATCHED_IMAGE_REPROCESSING` to `false`.

* The Scanner V4 Matcher now completes concurrent vulnerability updates using iterators, reducing memory consumption from 4GB to 500MB.

* {product-title-short} 4.5 slowly populates the initial registry integration repository list `/v2/_catalog` to improve Central startup performance. This change reduces startup time in environments with many autogenerated integrations.

* {product-title-short} 4.5 includes a new configuration option, `ROX_SCANNER_V4_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_AUTH`, to enable anonymous access to Scanner V4 for debugging purposes. This feature is on by default for development builds and off for release builds.

* Deployment bundles created with the `roxctl` CLI no longer contain PodSecurityPolicies (PSPs) by default. You must specify the `--enable-pod-security-policies` option when you generate deployment bundles to deploy to Kubernetes 1.25 or earlier.

* {product-title-short} 4.5 includes improved event handling for Sensor image scan when `ROX_UNQUALIFIED_SEARCH_REGISTRIES` is set to `true`. This enhancement ensures that only one simultaneous scan request is allowed per unique image, reducing redundant scans. Additionally, it increases the chances of scan cache hits when multiple names for the same image are observed. This feature is on by default when `ROX_UNQUALIFIED_SEARCH_REGISTRIES` is `true`. To turn it off, set  `ROX_SENSOR_SINGLE_SCAN` to `false` on Sensor.

* Red{nbsp}Hat has reduced the default timeout setting for {product-title-short} admission controller webhooks from 20 seconds to 10 seconds, resulting in an effective timeout of 12 seconds within the ValidatingWebhookConfiguration. This change aligns with the unconditional cap of 13 seconds in {ocp}. If you rely on longer timeouts, such as those with inline image scanning, you must specify a longer timeout explicitly in the `SecuredCluster` custom resource `admissionControl.timeoutSeconds`, in Helm `admissionControl.dynamic.timeout`, or within a sensor deployment bundle `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` manifest within the `admission-controller.yaml` file.

* With {product-title-short} 4.5, the ability to snooze Node and Platform CVEs is disabled by default. You must set `ROX_VULN_MGMT_LEGACY_SNOOZE` to `true` on Central to return to the earlier behavior.

[id="documentation-updates-450_{context}"]
== Documentation updates

* The documentation now clarifies that when you update Scanner definitions in offline mode, Scanner retrieves data from Central every 5 minutes, with Central updating the online data every 5 - 20 minutes and the offline data every 3 hours. For more information, see xref:../configuration/enable-offline-mode.adoc#update-scanner-definitions-in-offline-mode[Updating Scanner definitions in offline mode].
* The documentation to view and configure default policies, manage policy categories, and create your own categories was updated. For more information, see xref:../operating/manage-security-policies.adoc#manage-security-policies[Managing security policies].
* The documentation was updated to include the `--dnsport` option and the example links in the xref:../cli/generating-build-time-network-policies.adoc#using-the-build-time-network-policy-generator_generating-build-time-network-policies[Generating build-time network policies] section.
* The list of supported operating systems and versions was updated in the xref:../operating/examine-images-for-vulnerabilities.adoc#supported-operating-systems_examine-images-for-vulnerabilities[Supported operating systems] section.
* The documentation was updated to include new information about using the built-in email notifier in {product-title-managed-short}. For more information, see xref:../integration/integrate-with-email.adoc#integrating-with-email-on-rhacs-cloud-service[Integrating with email on {product-title-managed-short}].
* The managing compliance guide where you can find detailed instructions on how to use the compliance feature in {product-title-short} was updated. For more information, see xref:../operating/manage-compliance/compliance-feature-overview.adoc#compliance-feature-overview[Compliance feature overview].

[id="deprecated-features_{context}"]
=== Deprecated features

The following section provides information about deprecated features listed in the preceding table and other changes:

* To unify the response data for stream and unary API requests:

** The `error` field returned for failed unary API requests is deprecated. Instead of the `error` field, use the `message` field to retrieve error information. The `message` field has the same information as the `error` field.
** In the next {product-title-short} release, Red{nbsp}Hat will remove the `grpcCode`, `httpCode`, and `httpStatus` fields in returned error response for gRPC stream APIs. Instead, the response will include a new field, `code` which includes the `grpcCode` data.
* The `/v1/summary/counts` API has been deprecated.
* The `/v1/cve/requests` API for managing vulnerability exceptions is deprecated. Use the new `/v2/vulnerability-exceptions/` API.
* The `rhacs-collector-slim*` images have been deprecated. `rhacs-collector` images used to contain kernel modules and eBPF probes, but those items are no longer needed by {product-title-short}. The `rhacs-collector*` image and the `rhacs-collector-slim*` images are now functionally the same. The `rhacs-collector-slim*` image is planned for removal in a future release.
* Kernel support packages and driver download functionality are deprecated.
* The *Dashboard* view under *Vulnerability Management* is deprecated. Use the *Workload CVEs*, *Exception Management*, *Platform CVEs*, and *Node CVEs* views as alternatives.
* The Amazon S3 external backup integration interoperability with Google Cloud Storage is deprecated. You must use the xref:../integration/integrate-with-google-cloud-storage.adoc#integrate-with-google-cloud-storage[Google Cloud Storage integration] for backups.

[id="removed-features_{context}"]
=== Removed features

The following section provides information about removed features listed in the preceding table and other changes:

* Red{nbsp}Hat has dropped the support for Helm versions older than 3.9.0. {product-title-short} now requires Helm version 3.9.0 or later to render the `stackrox-central-services` and the `stackrox-secured-cluster-services` Helm charts.
* The `ROX_SCANNER_V4_NODE_JS_SUPPORT` environment variable has been replaced with the `ROX_SCANNER_V4_PARTIAL_NODE_JS_SUPPORT` environment variable.
* `EBPF` collection has been removed. Configurations are automatically converted to `CORE_BPF` when you upgrade, and the `forceCollection` option is no longer applicable.
* Direct upgrades from {product-title-short} version 3.74 or earlier to version 4.5 are no longer supported. To upgrade to version 4.5 or later, you must first upgrade to version 4.4.

[id="bug-fixes_{context}"]
== Bug fixes in version 4.5.0

*Release date*: 24 July 2024

* Previously, a bug prevented users without administrator privileges from accessing the listening endpoint data for clusters and namespaces for which they had `read` permission. With this update, users with `read` permission can now receive data from the listening endpoints service.

[id="about-release-451_{context}"]
== About release 4.5.1

This release includes notable technical changes and bug fixes.

[id="changes-in-version-451_{context}"]
=== Changes in version 4.5.1

* The network graph and the network policy generator in the {product-title-short} portal were updated to clarify that `AdminNetworkPolicy` and `BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy` resources are not taken into consideration in the network graph or during network policy generation.

* {product-title-short} components were updated to versions that include a fix for link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2024-41110[CVE-2024-41110]: Vulnerability in authorization plugins in Docker Engine (AuthZ).

[id="resolved-in-version-451_{context}"]
=== Bug fixes in version 4.5.1

*Release date:* 14 August 2024

* When upgrading to {product-title-short} 4.5.0, in some situations, the upgrade failed with a `central-db` error for the `uni_compliance_integrations_clusterid` constraint. This problem has been fixed.
* After upgrading to {product-title-short} 4.5.0, for nodes with more than 64 cores, Collector displayed an error about the ring buffer size not being allowed. This problem has been fixed.
* The network graph was broken for users with clusters running Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) version 1.29 and later due to a change from Google to use the managed public IP address range `34.118.224.0/20` for default networking services. The network graph marked this IP address range as external. This problem has been fixed.

[id="about-release-452_{context}"]
== About release 4.5.2

*Release date*: 16 September 2024

This release of {product-title-short} introduces the following change:

* The handling of orphaned node CVEs has been updated to prevent immediate removal and maintain accurate discovery times. To enable the updated feature, you must set the `ROX_ORPHANED_CVES_KEEP_ALIVE` variable in the Central deployment to `true`.

This release of {product-title-short} fixes the following bugs:

* Fixed an issue where Sensor was unable to identify {ocp} internal registry secrets due to a change in the pull secret annotation.

* Fixed an issue where policies incorrectly displayed an enforced value of `Yes` in the *Configuration Management* -> *Application & Infrastructure* -> *Deployments* page due to inconsistent status handling, while showing `No` in the *Violations* page.

* Fixed an issue where vulnerability data differed between the Vulnerability Management Workload CVE pages and the deprecated Vulnerability Management dashboard due to inconsistencies in vulnerability reporting.

This release of {product-title-short} fixes the following security vulnerability:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-3727[CVE-2024-3727]: Fixed a vulnerability related to Scanner where the `containers/image` digest type did not guarantee a valid type.
