[id="ocp-4-5-about-this-release"]
== About this release

Red Hat {product-title}
(link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2020:2409[RHBA-2020:2409]) is now
available. This release uses link:https://v1-18.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/[Kubernetes 1.18] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to
{product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

//Red Hat did not publicly release {product-title} 4.4.0 as the GA version and,
//instead, is releasing {product-title} 4.4.3 as the GA version.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at
https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift. The {cloud-redhat-com}
application for {product-title} allows you to deploy OpenShift clusters to
either on-premise or cloud environments.

{product-title} {product-version} is supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 or
later, as well as {op-system-first} 4.5.

You must use {op-system} for the control plane, which are also known as master machines, and
can use either {op-system} or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 or later for
compute machines, which are also known as worker machines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because only Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 7.7 or later is supported for compute
machines, you must not upgrade the Red Hat Enterprise Linux compute machines to
version 8.
====

With the release of {product-title} 4.5, version 4.2 is now end of life. For
more information, see the
link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy].

[id="ocp-4-5-new-features-and-enhancements"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

[id="ocp-4-5-installation-and-upgrade"]
=== Installation and upgrade

[id="ocp-4-5-installing-cluster-on-vsphere-using-installer-provisioned-infra"]
==== Installing a cluster on vSphere using installer-provisioned infrastructure

{product-title} 4.5 introduces support for installing a cluster on vSphere using
installer-provisioned infrastructure.

// For more information, see ../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned.adoc#installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned[Installing a cluster on vSphere]

[id="ocp-4-5-installing-cluster-on-gcp-using-user-provisioned-infra-and-shared-vpc"]
==== Installing a cluster on GCP using user-provisioned infrastructure and a shared VPC

{product-title} 4.5 introduces support for installing a cluster on Google Cloud
Platform (GCP) using user-provisioned infrastructure and a shared VPC.

// For more information, see ../installing//installing_gcp/installing-gcp-user-infra-vpc.adoc#installing-gcp-user-infra-vpc[Installing a cluster on GCP using Deployment Manager templates and a shared VPC].

[id="ocp-4-5-three-node-bare-metal-deployments"]
==== Three-node bare metal deployments

You can install and run three-node clusters in {product-title} with no workers.
This provides smaller, more resource efficient clusters for deployment,
development, and testing.

For more information, see
xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.adoc#installation-three-node-cluster_installing-bare-metal[Running a three-node cluster].

////
[id="ocp-4-5-migrate-azure-private-dns-zones"]
==== Migrating Azure private DNS zones

There is now a new `openshift-install migrate` command available for migrating
Azure private DNS zones. If you installed an {product-title} version 4.2 or 4.3
cluster on Azure that uses installer-provisioned infrastructure, your cluster
might use a legacy private DNS zone. If it does, you must migrate it to the new
type of private DNS zone.

// For more information on this new command and migrating Azure private DNS
// zones, see ../installing/installing_azure/migrating-azure-dns-zones.adoc#migrating-azure-dns-zones[Migrating legacy Azure DNS zones].
////
// Monitor whether this info moves to a KB article or remains in official docs.
// If it moves to KB, permanently remove this entry.

[id="ocp-4-5-restricted-network-upgrade"]
==== Updating a restricted network cluster

You can upgrade a cluster in a restricted network.

//For more information, see ../updating/updating-restricted-network-cluster.adoc#updating-restricted-network-cluster[Updating a restricted network cluster].

[id="ocp-4-5-nodes"]
=== Nodes

[id="ocp-4-5-descheduler-policy"]
==== New descheduler strategy is available (Technology Preview)

The descheduler now allows you to configure the `RemovePodsHavingTooManyRestarts` strategy. This strategy ensures that Pods that have been restarted too many times are removed from nodes.

See xref:../nodes/scheduling/nodes-descheduler.adoc#nodes-descheduler-strategies_nodes-descheduler[Descheduler strategies]
for more information.

[id="ocp-4-5-node-pull-secrets"]
==== Node pull secrets

You can import and use images from any registry configured during or after the
cluster installation by sharing the node's pull secret credentials with the
`openshift-api`, `builder`, and `image-registry` Pods.

[id="ocp-4-5-vertical-pod-autoscaler-tp"]
==== Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator (Technology Preview)

{product-title} {product-version} introduces the Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator (VPA). The VPA reviews the historic and current CPU and memory resources for containers in Pods and can update the resource limits and requests based on the usage values it learns. You create individual custom resources (CR) to instruct the VPA to update all of the Pods associated with a workload object, such as a Deployment, Deployment Config, StatefulSet, Job, DaemonSet, ReplicaSet, or ReplicationController. The VPA helps you to understand the optimal CPU and memory usage for your Pods and can automatically maintain Pod resources through the Pod lifecycle.

[id="ocp-4-5-web-console"]
=== Web console

[id="ocp-4-5-new-attribute-filters"]
====  New Infrastructure Features filters for Operators in OperatorHub

You can now filter Operators by *Infrastructure Features* in OperatorHub. For
example, select *Disconnected* to see Operators that work in
disconnected environments.

[id="ocp-4-5-scale"]
=== Scale

[id="ocp-4-5-scale-cluster-maximums"]
==== Cluster maximums

Updated guidance around
xref:../scalability_and_performance/planning-your-environment-according-to-object-maximums.adoc#planning-your-environment-according-to-object-maximums[Cluster
maximums] for {product-title} {product-version} is now available.

Use the link:https://access.redhat.com/labs/ocplimitscalculator/[{product-title}
Limit Calculator] to estimate cluster limits for your environment.

[id="ocp-4-5-networking"]
=== Networking

[id="ocp-4-5-mirgating-from-sdn-to-default-cni-tp"]
==== Migrating from the OpenShift SDN default CNI network provider (Technology Preview)

You can now migrate to the OVN-Kubernetes default Container Network Interface
(CNI) network provider from the OpenShift SDN default CNI network provider.

For more information, see
xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/migrate-from-openshift-sdn.adoc#migrate-from-openshift-sdn[Migrate from the OpenShift SDN default CNI network provider].

[id="ocp-4-5-ingress-enhancements"]
==== Ingress enhancements

There are two noteworthy Ingress enhancements introduced in {product-title} 4.5:

* You can enable access logs for the Ingress Controller.
//:../networking/ingress-operator.adoc#nw-configure-ingress-access-logging_configuring-ingress[enable access logs for the Ingress Controller].
* You can xref:../networking/ingress-operator.adoc#using-wildcard-routes_configuring-ingress[specify a wildcard route policy through the Ingress Controller].

[id="ocp-4-5-developer-experience"]
=== Developer experience

[id="ocp-4-5-oc-new-app-deployment-resources"]
==== oc new-app now produces Deployment resources

The `oc new-app` command now produces Deployment resources instead of
DeploymentConfig resources by default. If you prefer to create DeploymentConfig
resources, you can pass the `--as-deployment-config` flag when invoking `oc
new-app`. For more information, see
xref:../applications/deployments/what-deployments-are.adoc#what-deployments-are[Understanding Deployments and DeploymentConfigs].

[id="ocp-4-5-support-nodeaffinity-scheduler-in-image-registry-crd"]
==== Support node affinity scheduler in image registry CRD

The node affinity scheduler is now supported to ensure image registry
deployments complete even when an infrastructure node does not exist. The node
affinity scheduler must be manually configured.

See xref:../nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-node-affinity.adoc#nodes-scheduler-node-affinity[Controlling Pod placement on nodes using node affinity rules]
for more information.

[id="ocp-4-5-disaster-recovery"]
=== Disaster recovery

[id="ocp-4-5-auto-cert-recovery"]
==== Automatic control plane certificate recovery

{product-title} can now automatically recover from expired control plane certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve pending `node-bootstrapper` certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates.

See xref:../backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-3-expired-certs.adoc#dr-scenario-3-recovering-expired-certs_dr-recovering-expired-certs[Recovering from expired control plane certificates] for more information.

[id="ocp-4-5-storage"]
=== Storage

[id="ocp-4-5-persistent-storage-csi-ebs"]
==== Persistent storage using the AWS EBS CSI Driver Operator (Technology Preview)

You can now use the Container Storage Interface (CSI) to deploy the CSI driver you need for provisioning AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) persistent storage. This Operator is in Technology Preview.
// Add the following text with link when https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/pull/22350 has merged.
//To enable it, see install instructions in link[AWS Elastic Block Store CSI Driver Operator].

[id="ocp-4-5-persistent-storage-csi-manila"]
==== Persistent storage using the OpenStack Manila CSI Driver Operator

You can now use CSI to provision a PersistentVolume using the CSI driver for the OpenStack Manila shared file system service.
// Add the following text with link when https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/pull/22199 has merged.
//To enable it, see install instructions in link[OpenStack Manila CSI Driver Operator].

[id="ocp-4-5-persistent-storage-csi-inline"]
==== Persistent storage using CSI inline ephemeral volumes (Technology Preview)

You can now use CSI to specify volumes directly in the Pod specification, rather than in a PersistentVolume. This feature is in Technology Preview and is available by default when using CSI drivers. For more information, see xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/ephemeral-storage-csi-inline.adoc#ephemeral-storage-csi-inline[CSI inline ephemeral volumes].

[id="ocp-4-5-persistent-storage-csi-cloning"]
==== Persistent storage using CSI volume cloning

Volume cloning using CSI, previously in Technology Preview, is now fully supported in OpenShift Container Platform 4.5. For more information, see xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-cloning.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-cloning[CSI volume cloning].

[id="ocp-4-5-olm"]
=== Operator Lifecycle Manager

[id="ocp-4-5-olm-v1-crd"]
==== v1 CRD support

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) now supports Operators using v1 Custom Resource
Definitions (CRDs) when loading Operators into catalogs and deploying them on
cluster. Previously, OLM only supported v1beta1 CRDs; OLM now manages both v1
and v1beta1 CRDs in the same way.

To support this feature, OLM now enforces CRD upgrades are safer by ensuring
existing CRD storage versions are not missing in the upgraded CRD, avoiding
potential data loss.

[id="ocp-4-5-notable-technical-changes"]
== Notable technical changes

{product-title} 4.5 introduces the following notable technical changes.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-5-osdk-v0-17-1"]
==== Operator SDK v0.17.1

{product-title} 4.5 supports Operator SDK v0.17.1, which introduces the
following notable technical changes:

* The `--crd-version` flag was added to the `new`, `add api`, `add crd`, and
`generate crds` commands so that users can opt-in to `v1` CRDs. The default setting
is `v1beta1`.

Ansible-based Operator enhancements include:

* Support for relative Ansible roles and playbooks paths in the Ansible-based Operator Watches files.
* Event statistics output to the Operator logs.

Helm-based Operator enhancements include:

* Support for Prometheus metrics.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-5-termination-grace-period-support"]
==== terminationGracePeriod parameter support

{product-title} now properly supports the `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`
parameter with the CRI-O container runtime.

[id="ocp-4-5-deprecated-removed-features"]
== Deprecated and removed features

Some features available in previous releases have been deprecated or removed.

Deprecated functionality is still included in {product-title} and continues to
be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of this product
and is not recommended for new deployments. For the most recent list of major
functionality deprecated and removed within {product-title} {product-version},
refer to the table below. Additional details for more fine-grained functionality
that has been deprecated and removed are listed after the table.

In the table, features are marked with the following statuses:

* *GA*: _General Availability_

[id="ocp-4-5-deprecated-features"]
=== Deprecated features

[id="ocp-4-5-deprecation-of-operatorsources"]
==== OperatorSources and CatalogSourceConfigs block cluster upgrades

OperatorSources and CatalogSourceConfigs have been deprecated for several
{product-title} releases. Starting in {product-title} 4.4, if there are any
custom OperatorSources or CatalogSourceConfigs objects present on the cluster,
the `marketplace` cluster Operator sets an `Upgradeable=false` condition and
issues a *Warning* alert. This means that upgrades to {product-title} 4.5 are
blocked if the objects are still installed.

[NOTE]
====
Upgrades to {product-title} 4.4 z-stream releases are still permitted in this
state.
====

In {product-title} 4.5, OperatorSources are still deprecated and only exist for
the use of the default OperatorSources. CatalogSourceConfigs, however, are now
removed.

See the
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/release_notes/ocp-4-4-release-notes.html#ocp-4-4-marketplace-apis-deprecated[{product-title} 4.4 release notes]
for how to convert OperatorSources and CatalogSourceConfigs to using
CatalogSources directly, which clears the alert and enables cluster upgrades to
{product-title} 4.5.

[id="ocp-4-5-removed-features"]
=== Removed features

[id="ocp-4-5-oc-commands-flags-removed"]
==== OpenShift CLI commands and flags removed

The following `oc` commands and flags are affected:

* The `oc policy can-i` command was deprecated in {product-title} 3.9 and has
been removed. You must use `oc auth can-i` instead.

* The `--image` flag previously used for the `oc new-app` and `oc new-build`
commands was deprecated in {product-title} 3.2 and has been removed. You must
use the `--image-stream` flag with these commands instead.

* The `--list` flag previously used in the `oc set volumes` command was
deprecated in {product-title} 3.3 and has been removed. The `oc set volumes`
lists volumes without a flag.

* The `-t` flag previously used in the `oc process` command was deprecated in
{product-title} 3.11 and has been removed. You must use the `--template` flag
with this command instead.

* The `--output-version` flag previously used in the `oc process` command was
deprecated in {product-title} 3.11 and has been removed. This flag was already
ignored.

* The `-v` flag previously used in the `oc set deployment-hook` command was
deprecated in {product-title} 3.11 and has been removed. You must use the
`--volumes` flag with this command instead.

* The `-v` and `--verbose` flags previously used in the `oc status` command were
deprecated in {product-title} 3.11 and have been removed. You must use the
`--suggest` flag with this command instead.

[id="ocp-4-5-service-catalog-removed"]
==== Service Catalog, Template Service Broker, and their Operators

[IMPORTANT]
====
Service Catalog is not installed by default in {product-title} 4; however, it
now blocks upgrades to {product-title} 4.5 if installed.
====

Service Catalog, Template Service Broker, Ansible Service Broker, and their
associated Operators were deprecated starting in {product-title} 4.2. Ansible
Service Broker, including Ansible Service Broker Operator and related APIs and
APBs, were removed in {product-title} 4.4.

Service Catalog, Template Service Broker, and their associated Operators are now
removed in {product-title} 4.5, including the related
`.servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1beta1` API.

[NOTE]
====
Templates are still available in {product-title} 4.5, but they are no longer
handled by Template Service Broker. By default, the Samples Operator handles Red
Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)-based {product-title} ImageStreams and Templates.
See
xref:../openshift_images/configuring-samples-operator.adoc#configuring-samples-operator[Configuring the Samples Operator]
for details.
====

The `service-catalog-controller-manager` and `service-catalog-apiserver` cluster
Operators were set to `Upgradeable=false` in 4.4. This means that they block
cluster upgrades to the next minor version, 4.5 in this case, if they are still
installed at that time. Upgrades to z-stream releases such as 4.4.z, however,
are still permitted in this state.

If Service Catalog and Template Service Broker are enabled in 4.4, specifically
if their management state is set to `Managed`, the web console warns cluster
administrators that these features are still enabled. The following alerts can
be viewed from the *Monitoring* -> *Alerting* page on a 4.4 cluster and have a
*Warning* severity:

* `ServiceCatalogAPIServerEnabled`
* `ServiceCatalogControllerManagerEnabled`
* `TemplateServiceBrokerEnabled`

If they are still enabled on a 4.4 cluster, cluster administrators can see
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/applications/service_brokers/uninstalling-service-catalog.html#sb-uninstalling-service-catalog[Uninstalling Service Catalog] and link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/applications/service_brokers/uninstalling-template-service-broker.html#sb-uninstalling-template-service-broker[Uninstalling Template Service Broker]
in the {product-title} 4.4 documentation to uninstall it, which permits cluster
upgrades to 4.5.

In 4.5, a pair of Jobs are created in a new `openshift-service-catalog-removed`
namespace to run during the cluster upgrade process. Their behavior depends on
the management state of Service Catalog:

* `Removed`: The Jobs remove the following Service Catalog items:
** Operators
** namespaces
** Custom Resources (CRs)
** ClusterRoles
** ClusterRoleBindings

* `Unmanaged`: The Jobs skip removal and do nothing.

* `Managed`: The Jobs report an error in logs. This state is unlikely to occur because
upgrades would have been blocked. The Jobs take no other actions.

The Jobs and `openshift-service-catalog-removed` namespace will be removed in a
future {product-title} release.

[NOTE]
====
As of {product-title} 4.5, all Red Hat-provided service brokers have been
removed. Any other broker installed by users is not removed by the upgrade
process. This is to avoid removing any services that might have been deployed
using the brokers. Users must remove these brokers manually.
====

[id="ocp-4-5-csc-removed"]
==== CatalogSourceConfigs removed

CatalogSourceConfigs are now removed. See
xref:ocp-4-5-deprecation-of-operatorsources[OperatorSources and CatalogSourceConfigs block cluster upgrades]
for more details.

[id="ocp-4-5-known-issues"]
== Known issues

* When upgrading to a new {product-title} z-stream release, connectivity to the API server might be interrupted as nodes are upgraded, causing API requests to fail. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1791162[*BZ#1791162*])

* When upgrading to a new {product-title} z-stream release, connectivity to routers might be interrupted as router pods are updated. For the duration of the upgrade, some applications might not be consistently reachable. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1809665[*BZ#1809665*])

* Because the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` for image registry pull-through is not
yet supported, the deployment Pod cannot mirror images by using a digest ID if
the imagestream has the pull-through policy enabled. In this case, an
`ImagePullBackOff` error displays.
