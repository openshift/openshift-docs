[id="ocp-4-5-about-this-release"]
== About this release

// Copied from 4.4 RNs. Edit/confirm for 4.5 release.

Red Hat {product-title}
(link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2020:1234[RHBA-2020:1234]) is now
available. This release uses link:https://v1-18.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/[Kubernetes 1.18] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to
{product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

//Red Hat did not publicly release {product-title} 4.4.0 as the GA version and,
//instead, is releasing {product-title} 4.4.3 as the GA version.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at
https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift. The {cloud-redhat-com}
application for {product-title} allows you to deploy OpenShift clusters to
either on-premise or cloud environments.

{product-title} {product-version} is supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 or
later, as well as {op-system-first} 4.5.

You must use {op-system} for the control plane, which are also known as master machines, and
can use either {op-system} or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 or later for
compute machines, which are also known as worker machines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because only Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 7.6 or later is supported for compute
machines, you must not upgrade the Red Hat Enterprise Linux compute machines to
version 8.
====

////
With the release of {product-title} 4.5, version 4.2 is now end of life. For
more information, see the
link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy].
////
// Must confirm this really happens at 4.5 release time.

==== Service CA bundle removal

The `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-ca.crt` file
previously deprecated in {product-title} 4.1 has been removed. The
aforementioned file was used by Pods to consume the service-serving CA bundle.
If you were still using this file in previous versions of {product-title}, you
must migrate to obtaining the CA bundle from a ConfigMap annotated with
`service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle=true`.
