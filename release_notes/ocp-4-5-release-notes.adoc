enterprise-class applications, while delivering integrated application runtimes
and libraries. {product-title} enables organizations to meet security, privacy,
compliance, and governance requirements.

[id="ocp-4-5-about-this-release"]
== About this release

// Copied from 4.4 RNs. Edit/confirm for 4.5 release.

Red Hat {product-title}
(link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2020:1234[RHBA-2020:1234]) is now
available. This release uses link:https://v1-18.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/[Kubernetes 1.18] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to
{product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

//Red Hat did not publicly release {product-title} 4.4.0 as the GA version and,
//instead, is releasing {product-title} 4.4.3 as the GA version.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at
https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift. The {cloud-redhat-com}
application for {product-title} allows you to deploy OpenShift clusters to
either on-premise or cloud environments.

{product-title} {product-version} is supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 or
later, as well as {op-system-first} 4.5.

You must use {op-system} for the control plane, which are also known as master machines, and
can use either {op-system} or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 or later for
compute machines, which are also known as worker machines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because only Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 7.6 or later is supported for compute
machines, you must not upgrade the Red Hat Enterprise Linux compute machines to
version 8.
====

////
With the release of {product-title} 4.5, version 4.2 is now end of life. For
more information, see the
link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy].
////
// Must confirm this really happens at 4.5 release time.

[id="ocp-4-5-new-features-and-enhancements"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.


[id="ocp-4-5-nodes"]
=== Nodes

[id="ocp-4-5-descheduler-policy"]
==== New descheduler strategy is available (Technology Preview)

The descheduler now allows you to configure the `RemovePodsHavingTooManyRestarts` strategy. This strategy ensures that Pods that have been restarted too many times are removed from nodes.

See xref:../nodes/scheduling/nodes-descheduler.adoc#nodes-descheduler-strategies_nodes-descheduler[Descheduler strategies]
for more information.

[id="ocp-4-5-node-pull-secrets"]
==== Node pull secrets

You can import and use images from any registry configured during or after the
cluster installation by sharing the node's pull secret credentials with the
`openshift-api`, `builder`, and `image-registry` Pods.

[id="ocp-4-5-web-console"]
=== Web console

[id="ocp-4-5-new-attribute-filters"]
====  New Infrastructure Features filters for Operators in OperatorHub

You can now filter Operators by *Infrastructure Features* in OperatorHub. For
example, select *Disconnected* if you want to see Operators that work in
disconnected environments.

[id="ocp-4-5-developer-experience"]
=== Developer experience

[id="ocp-4-5-oc-new-app-deployment-resources"]
==== oc new-app now produces Deployment resources

The `oc new-app` command now produces Deployment resources instead of
DeploymentConfig resources by default. If you prefer to create DeploymentConfig
resources, you can pass the `--as-deployment-config` flag when invoking `oc
new-app`. For more information, see
xref:../applications/deployments/what-deployments-are.adoc#what-deployments-are[Understanding Deployments and DeploymentConfigs].

[id="ocp-4-5-notable-technical-changes"]
== Notable technical changes

{product-title} 4.5 introduces the following notable technical changes.

[id="ocp-4-5-osdk-v0-17-1"]
==== Operator SDK v0.17.1

{product-title} 4.5 supports Operator SDK v0.17.1, which introduces the
following notable technical changes:

* The `--crd-version` flag was added to the `new`, `add api`, `add crd`, and
`generate crds` commands so that users can opt-in to `v1` CRDs. The default setting
is `v1beta1`.

[id="ocp-4-5-ovn-k8s-pod-np-uses-ovs-on-cluster-nodes"]
==== OVN-Kubernetes Pod network provider now uses OVS installed on cluster nodes

The OVN-Kubernetes Pod network provider now uses the Open vSwitch (OVS) version
installed on the cluster nodes. Previously, OVS ran in a container on each node,
managed by a DaemonSet. Using the host OVS eliminates any possible downtime from
upgrading the containerized version of OVS.

[id="ocp-4-5-deprecated-removed-features"]
== Deprecated and removed features

Some features available in previous releases have been deprecated or removed.

Deprecated functionality is still included in {product-title} and continues to
be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of this product
and is not recommended for new deployments. For the most recent list of major
functionality deprecated and removed within {product-title} {product-version},
refer to the table below. Additional details for more fine-grained functionality
that has been deprecated and removed are listed after the table.

In the table, features are marked with the following statuses:

* *GA*: _General Availability_
* *DEP*: _Deprecated_
* *-*: _Removed_

[id="ocp-4-5-oc-commands-flags-removed"]
==== OpenShift CLI commands and flags removed

The following `oc` commands and flags are affected:

* The `oc policy can-i` command was deprecated in {product-title} 3.9 and has
been removed. You must use `oc auth can-i` instead.

* The `--image` flag previously used for the `oc new-app` and `oc new-build`
commands was deprecated in {product-title} 3.2 and has been removed. You must
use the `--image-stream` flag with these commands instead.

* The `--list` flag previously used in the `oc set volumes` command was
deprecated in {product-title} 3.3 and has been removed. The `oc set volumes`
lists volumes without a flag.

* The `-t` flag previously used in the `oc process` command was deprecated in
{product-title} 3.11 and has been removed. You must use the `--template` flag
with this command instead.

* The `--output-version` flag previously used in the `oc process` command was
deprecated in {product-title} 3.11 and has been removed. This flag was already
ignored.

* The `-v` flag previously used in the `oc set deployment-hook` command was
deprecated in {product-title} 3.11 and has been removed. You must use the
`--volumes` flag with this command instead.

* The `-v` and `--verbose` flags previously used in the `oc status` command were
deprecated in {product-title} 3.11 and have been removed. You must use the
`--suggest` flag with this command instead.
