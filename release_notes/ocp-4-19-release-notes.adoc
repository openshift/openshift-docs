== About this release

// TODO: Update with the relevant information closer to release.
{product-title} (link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-202X:XXXX[RHSA-202X:XXXX]) is now available. This release uses link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.32.md[Kubernetes 1.32] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at https://console.redhat.com/openshift. From the {hybrid-console}, you can deploy {product-title} clusters to either on-premises or cloud environments.

// Double check OP system versions
{product-title} {product-version} is supported on {op-system-base-full} 8.8 and a later version of {op-system-base} 8 that is released before End of Life of {product-title} {product-version}. {product-title} {product-version} is also supported on {op-system-first} {product-version}. To understand {op-system-base} versions used by {op-system}, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6907891[{op-system-base} Versions Utilized by {op-system-first} and {product-title}] (Knowledgebase article).

You must use {op-system} machines for the control plane, and you can use either {op-system} or {op-system-base} for compute machines. {op-system-base} machines are deprecated in {product-title} 4.16 and will be removed in a future release.
//Removed the note per https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GRPA-3517

//Even-numbered release lifecycle verbiage (Comment in for even-numbered releases)
Starting from {product-title} 4.14, the Extended Update Support (EUS) phase for even-numbered releases increases the total available lifecycle to 24 months on all supported architectures, including `x86_64`, 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), and {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architectures. Beyond this, Red{nbsp}Hat also offers a 12-month additional EUS add-on, denoted as _Additional EUS Term 2_, that extends the total available lifecycle from 24 months to 36 months. The Additional EUS Term 2 is available on all architecture variants of {product-title}. For more information about support for all versions, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

//Odd-numbered release lifecycle verbiage (Comment in for odd-numbered releases)
////
The support lifecycle for odd-numbered releases, such as {product-title} {product-version}, on all supported architectures, including `x86_64`, 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), and {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architectures is 18 months. For more information about support for all versions, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].
////

Commencing with the {product-title} 4.14 release, Red{nbsp}Hat is simplifying the administration and management of Red{nbsp}Hat shipped cluster Operators with the introduction of three new life cycle classifications; Platform Aligned, Platform Agnostic, and Rolling Stream. These life cycle classifications provide additional ease and transparency for cluster administrators to understand the life cycle policies of each Operator and form cluster maintenance and upgrade plans with predictable support boundaries. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/j/includes/session/scribe/?redirectTo=https%3A%2F%2Faccess.redhat.com%2Fsupport%2Fpolicy%2Fupdates%2Fopenshift_operators[OpenShift Operator Life Cycles].

// Added in 4.14. Language came directly from Kirsten Newcomer.
{product-title} is designed for FIPS. When running {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures.

For more information about the NIST validation program, see link:https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules[Cryptographic Module Validation Program]. For the latest NIST status for the individual versions of {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted for validation, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2918071#fips-140-2-and-fips-140-3-2[Compliance Activities and Government Standards].

[id="ocp-4-19-installation-and-update-remove-terraform-ibm-cloud_{context}"]
==== Cluster API replaces Terraform on {ibm-cloud-title} installations

In {product-title} {product-version}, the installation program uses the Cluster API instead of Terraform to provision cluster infrastructure during installations on {ibm-cloud-title}.

[id="ocp-4-19-installation-and-update-remove-terraform-azure-stack-hub_{context}"]
==== Cluster API replaces Terraform on {azure-first} Stack Hub installations

In {product-title} {product-version}, the installation program uses the Cluster API instead of Terraform to provision clusters during installer-provisioned infrastructure installations on {azure-first} Stack Hub.

[id="ocp-4-19-admin-ack-updating_{context}"]
==== Required administrator acknowledgment when updating from {product-title} 4.18 to 4.19

{product-title} 4.19 uses Kubernetes 1.32, which removed several xref:../release_notes/ocp-4-19-release-notes.adoc#ocp-4-19-removed-kube-1-32-apis_{context}[deprecated APIs].

A cluster administrator must provide manual acknowledgment before the cluster can be updated from {product-title} 4.18 to 4.19. This is to help prevent issues after updating to {product-title} 4.19, where APIs that have been removed are still in use by workloads, tools, or other components running on or interacting with the cluster. Administrators must evaluate their cluster for any APIs in use that will be removed and migrate the affected components to use the appropriate new API version. After this is done, the administrator can provide the administrator acknowledgment.

All {product-title} 4.18 clusters require this administrator acknowledgment before they can be updated to {product-title} 4.19.

For more information, see xref:../updating/preparing_for_updates/updating-cluster-prepare.adoc#updating-cluster-prepare[Preparing to update to {product-title} 4.19].

==== Creating a route with externally managed certificate (General Availability)

With this release, {product-title} routes can be configured with third-party certificate management solutions, utilising the `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` field in the route API. This allows you to reference externally managed TLS certificates through secrets, streamlining the process by eliminating manual certificate management. By using externally managed certificates, you reduce errors, ensure a smoother certificate update process, and enable the OpenShift router to promptly serve renewed certificates. For more information, see xref:../networking/routes/secured-routes.adoc#nw-ingress-route-secret-load-external-cert_secured-routes[Creating a route with externally managed certificate].

[id="ocp-4-19-networking-ptp-dual-oc_{context}"]
==== Dual-port NICs for improved redundancy in PTP ordinary clocks (Technology Preview)
With this release, you can use a dual-port network interface controller (NIC) to improve redundancy for Precision Time Protocol (PTP) ordinary clocks.
Available as a Technology Preview, in a dual-port NIC configuration for an ordinary clock, if one port fails, the standby port takes over, maintaining PTP timing synchronization.

[NOTE]
====
You can configure PTP ordinary clocks with added redundancy on `x86` architecture nodes with dual-port NICs only.
====

For more information, see xref:../networking/ptp/about-ptp.adoc#ptp-dual-ports-oc_about-ptp[Using dual-port NICs to improve redundancy for PTP ordinary clocks].

[id="ocp-4-19-dpu-device-management-with-dpu-operator_{context}"]
==== Enabling DPU device management with the DPU Operator
With this release, {product-title} introduces the Data Processing Unit (DPU) Operator, enabling management of DPU devices. The DPU Operator manages components on compute nodes with DPUs, enabling the offloading of data workloads such as networking, storage, and security. This leads to improved cluster performance, reduced latency, and enhanced security, contributing to a more efficient infrastructure. For more information, see xref:../networking/networking_operators/dpu-operator/about-dpu.adoc#about-dpu-and-dpu-operator[About DPU and the DPU Operator].

[id="ocp-release-notes-web-console_{context}"]
=== Web console

Starting with {product-title} 4.19, the perspectives in the web console have unified to simplify navigation, reduce context switching, streamline tasks, and provide users with a more cohesive {product-title} experience.

With this unified design, there is no longer a *Developer* perspective in the default view; however, _all_ {product-title} web console features are discoverable to all users. If you are not the cluster owner, you might need to request permission for certain features from the cluster owner. The *Developer* perspective can still be manually enabled if you prefer.

The *Getting Started* pane in the web console provides resources such as, a tour of the console, information on setting up your cluster, a quick start for enabling the *Developer* perspective, and links to explore new features and capabilities.

//See xref:../web_console/web-console-overview#enabling-developer-perspective_web-console_web-console-overview for more information on enabling the *Developer* perspective.

==== Package-based {op-system-base} compute machines
With this release, support for the installation of packaged-based {op-system-base} worker nodes is removed.

{op-system} image layering replaces this feature and supports installing additional packages on the base operating system of your worker nodes.

For information on how to identify and remove {op-system-base} nodes in your cluster, see xref:../updating/preparing_for_updates/updating-cluster-prepare-past-4-18.adoc#updating-cluster-prepare-past-4-18[Preparing to update from {product-title} 4.18 to a newer version]. For more information on image layering, see xref:../machine_configuration/mco-coreos-layering.adoc#mco-coreos-layering[{op-system} image layering].

[id="ocp-4-19-removed-kube-1-32-apis_{context}"]
==== APIs removed from Kubernetes 1.32

Kubernetes 1.32 removed the following deprecated APIs, so you must migrate manifests and API clients to use the appropriate API version. For more information about migrating removed APIs, see the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-32[Kubernetes documentation].

==== Operator SDK CLI and related scaffolding and testing tools

With this release, the Red{nbsp}Hat-supported version of the Operator SDK CLI tool, including the related scaffolding and testing tools for Operator projects, is no longer released with {product-title}.

Red{nbsp}Hat will provide bug fixes and support for versions of the Operator SDK that were released with earlier versions of {product-title} according to the link:https://access.redhat.com/product-life-cycles?product=OpenShift%20Container%20Platform%204[Product Life Cycles for {product-title} 4] (Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal).

Operator authors with existing Operator projects can use the version of the Operator SDK CLI tool released with {product-title} 4.18 to maintain their projects and create Operator releases targeting newer versions of {product-title}. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/node/7123119[Updating the base image for existing Ansible- or Helm-based Operator projects for {product-title} 4.19 and later] (Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledgebase).

==== Installer

* Previously, if you attempted to install an {aws-first} cluster with minimum privileges and you did not specify an instance type in the `install-config.yaml` file, installation of the cluster failed. This issue happened because the installation program could not find supported instance types that the cluster uses in availability zones. For example, the `m6i.xlarge` default instance type was unavailable in `ap-southeast-4` and `eu-south-2` availability zones. With this release, the `openshift-install` program now requires the `ec2:DescribeInstanceTypeOfferings` {aws-short} permission to prevent the installation of the cluster from failing in situations where `m6i.xlarge` or another supported instance type is unavailable in a supported availability zone.

== Known issues

* In {product-title} {product-version}, clusters using IPsec for network encryption might experience intermittent loss of pod-to-pod connectivity. This prevents some pods on certain nodes from reaching services on other nodes, resulting in connection timeouts.
+
Internal testing could not reproduce this issue on clusters with 120 nodes or less.
+
There is no workaround for this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-55453[OCPBUGS-55453])

* {product-title} clusters that are installed on {aws-short} in the Mexico Central region (`mx-central-1`) cannot be destroyed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-56020[*OCPBUGS-56020*])

== Asynchronous errata updates

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for {product-title} {product-version} are released as asynchronous errata through the Red{nbsp}Hat Network. All {product-title} {product-version} errata is https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[available on the Red Hat Customer Portal]. See the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} Life Cycle] for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account settings for Red{nbsp}Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications are enabled, users are notified through email whenever new errata relevant to their registered systems are released.

[NOTE]
====
Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming {product-title} entitlements for {product-title} errata notification emails to generate.
====

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of {product-title} {product-version}. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form {product-title} {product-version}.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any {product-title} release, always review the instructions on xref:../updating/updating_a_cluster/updating-cluster-web-console.adoc#updating-cluster-web-console[updating your cluster] properly.
