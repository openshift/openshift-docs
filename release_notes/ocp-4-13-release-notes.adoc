==== Importing manifests with the OpenShift CLI (oc)

As of {product-title} 4.12, limited usability (Technology Preview) support for manifest listed images on image streams is available.

With {product-title} {product-version}, a new `oc` command line interface (CLI) flag, `--import-mode`, has been added to the following `oc` commands:

* `oc import-image`
* `oc tag`

With this enhancement, users can set the `--import-mode` flag to `Legacy` or `PreserveOriginal`, which provides users the option to import a single sub-manifest, or all manifests, of a manifest list when running the `oc import-image` or `oc tag` commands.

//Insert reference for feature procedure

[id="ocp-4-13-oc-describe-enhancement"]
==== Returning os/arch and digests of an image

With {product-title} {product-version}, running `oc describe` on an image now returns os/arch and digests of each manifest.

[id="ocp-4-13-cluster-cloud-controller-manager-operator"]
==== Cloud controller managers for additional cloud providers

The Kubernetes community plans to deprecate the use of the Kubernetes controller manager to interact with underlying cloud platforms in favor of using cloud controller managers. As a result, there is no plan to add Kubernetes controller manager support for any new cloud platforms.
//Can reuse this for Nutanix in 4.13:
//The Alibaba Cloud and IBM Cloud implementations that are added in this release of {product-title} use cloud controller managers.

//In addition, this
This release introduces the General Availability of using cloud controller managers for VMware vSphere.

To learn more about the cloud controller manager, see the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller/[Kubernetes Cloud Controller Manager documentation].

To manage the cloud controller manager and cloud node manager deployments and lifecycles, use the Cluster Cloud Controller Manager Operator.

For more information, see the xref:../operators/operator-reference.adoc#cluster-cloud-controller-manager-operator_cluster-operators-ref[Cluster Cloud Controller Manager Operator] entry in the _Platform Operators reference_.

== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.8 and beyond! This needs some SME/QE review before being updated for 4.11. Need to check if KI should be removed or should stay.
* In {product-title} 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.
+
If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.1 to {product-version}, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. Unless there is a specific need for unauthenticated access, you should revoke it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP `403` errors if you revoke unauthenticated access.
====
+
Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:
+
[source,bash]

As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])

== Asynchronous errata updates

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for {product-title} {product-version} are released as asynchronous errata through the Red Hat Network. All {product-title} {product-version} errata is https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[available on the Red Hat Customer Portal]. See the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} Life Cycle] for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account settings for Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications are enabled, users are notified through email whenever new errata relevant to their registered systems are released.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming {product-title} entitlements for {product-title} errata notification emails to generate.
====

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of {product-title} {product-version}. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form {product-title} {product-version}.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any {product-title} release, always review the instructions on xref:../updating/updating-cluster-within-minor.adoc#updating-cluster-within-minor[updating your cluster] properly.
