[[online-39-add-support-for-deployments-to-oc-status]]
==== Add Support for Deployments to oc status

The `oc status` command provides an overview of the current project. This
provides similar output for upstream deployments as can be seen for downstream
DeploymentConfigs, with a nested deployment set:

----
$ oc status
In project My Project (myproject) on server https://127.0.0.1:8443

svc/ruby-deploy - 172.30.174.234:8080
  deployment/ruby-deploy deploys istag/ruby-deploy:latest <-
    bc/ruby-deploy source builds https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git on istag/ruby-22-centos7:latest
      build #1 failed 5 hours ago - bbb6701: Merge pull request #18 from durandom/master (Joe User <joeuser@users.noreply.github.com>)
    deployment #2 running for 4 hours - 0/1 pods (warning: 53 restarts)
    deployment #1 deployed 5 hours ago
----

Compare this to the output from OpenShift Container Platform 3.7:

----
$ oc status
In project dc-test on server https://127.0.0.1:8443

svc/ruby-deploy - 172.30.231.16:8080
  pod/ruby-deploy-5c7cc559cc-pvq9l runs test

[[online-39-memory-usage-improvements]]
==== Jenkins Memory Usage Improvements

Previously, Jenkins worker pods would often consume too much or too little
memory. Now, a startup script intelligently looks at pod limits and environment
variables are appropriately set to ensure limits are respected for spawned JVMs.
