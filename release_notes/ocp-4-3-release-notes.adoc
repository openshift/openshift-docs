provides a more secure and scalable multi-tenant operating system for todayâ€™s
enterprise-class applications, while delivering integrated application runtimes
and libraries. {product-title} enables organizations to meet security, privacy,
compliance, and governance requirements.

[id="ocp-4-3-about-this-release"]
== About this release

Red Hat {product-title}
(link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2020:0062[RHBA-2020:0062]) is now
available. This release uses link:https://v1-16.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/[Kubernetes 1.16] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to
{product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

[NOTE]
====
This is an increase of two versions of Kubernetes from {product-title} 4.2, which used Kubernetes 1.14.
====

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at
https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift. The {cloud-redhat-com}
application for {product-title} allows you to deploy OpenShift clusters to
either on-premise or cloud environments.

{product-title} {product-version} is supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 or
later, as well as Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS 4.3.

You must use {op-system-first} for the control plane, or master, machines and
can use either {op-system} or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 or later for
compute, or worker, machines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because only Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 7.6 or later is supported for compute
machines, you must not upgrade the Red Hat Enterprise Linux compute machines to
version 8.
====

[id="ocp-4-3-new-features-and-enhancements"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

[id="ocp-4-3-installation-and-upgrade"]
=== Installation and upgrade

[id="ocp-4-3-phased-rollout"]
==== {product-title} upgrades phased rollout

In {product-title} 4.1, Red Hat introduced the concept of upgrade channels for
recommending the appropriate upgrade versions to your cluster. Upgrade channels
separate upgrade strategies and also are used to control the cadence of updates.
Channels are tied to a minor version of {product-title}. For instance,
{product-title} {product-version} channels will never include an upgrade to a
4.4 release. This ensures administrators make an explicit decision to upgrade to
the next minor version of {product-title}. Channels only control updates and
have no impact on the version of the cluster you install; the
`openshift-install` binary for a given patch level of  {product-title} always
installs that patch level.

You must choose the upgrade channel version corresponding to the {product-title}
version you plan to upgrade to. {product-title} {product-version} includes the
upgrade from the previous 4.2 release.

See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4495171[OpenShift 4.x Upgrades
phased roll out] for more information on the types of updates and upgrade
channels.

Because upgrades are published to the channels as they are gradually rolled out
to customers based on data from the Red Hat Service Reliability Engineering
(SRE) team, you might not immediately see notification in the web console that
updates from version 4.2.z to 4.3 are available at initial release.

[id="ocp-4-3-fips-clusters"]
==== Support for FIPS cryptography

You can now install an {product-title} cluster that uses FIPS
validated / Implementation Under Test cryptographic libraries. {product-title}
uses certain FIPS validated / Implementation Under Test modules within Red Hat
Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Red Hat CoreOS (RHCOS) for the operating system
components that it uses. For more information, see
xref:../installing/installing-fips.adoc#installing-fips[Support for FIPS cryptography].

[id="ocp-4-3-deploy-private-clusters"]
==== Deploy private clusters on AWS, Azure, or GCP

You can install a private cluster into an

* existing VPC on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
* existing VPC on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
* existing Azure Virtual Network (VNet) on Microsoft Azure.

To create a private cluster on these cloud platforms, you must provide an
existing private VPC/VNet and subnets to host the cluster. The installation
program configures the Ingress Operator and API server for access from only the
private network.

For more information on deploying private clusters to each supported cloud
platform, see the installation guides for
xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-private.adoc#installing-aws-private[AWS],
xref:../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-private.adoc#installing-azure-private[Azure],
and xref:../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-private.adoc#installing-gcp-private[GCP].

[id="ocp-4-3-security"]
=== Security

[id="ocp-4-3-cert-rotation"]
==== Automated rotation of service serving certificates CA

Automated service CA rotation will be available in this release in a future
z-stream update. In previous versions, the service CA did not automatically
renew, leading to service disruption and requiring manual intervention. The
service CA and signing key now auto-rotate before expiration. This allows
administrators to plan for their environments in advance, avoiding service
disruption.

[id="ocp-4-3-encrypt-data-stored-in-etcd"]
==== Encrypt data stored in etcd

You can now xref:../authentication/encrypting-etcd.adoc#encrypting-etcd[encrypt data stored in etcd].
Enabling etcd encryption for your cluster provides an additional layer of data
security.

When you enable etcd encryption, the following OpenShift API server and
Kubernetes API server resources are encrypted:

* Secrets
* ConfigMaps
* Routes
* OAuth access tokens
* OAuth authorize tokens

[id="ocp-4-3-cluster-monitoring"]
=== Cluster monitoring

[id="ocp-4-3-performance-improvements-for-promql-query-browser-in-console"]
==== Improvements for PromQL query browser in web console

Performance improvements are now available for the PromQL query browser used in
the {product-title} web console.

[id="ocp-4-3-use-pod-capacity-metric-for-kubelettoomanypods-alert"]
==== Use Pod capacity metric for KubeletTooManyPods alert

The `KubeletTooManyPods` alert now uses the Pod capacity metric as a threshold
instead of a fixed number.

[id="ocp-4-3-monitor-your-own-services"]
==== Monitor your own services (Technology Preview)

The existing monitoring stack can be extended so you can configure monitoring
for your own Services.

[id="ocp-4-3-querying-metrics-in-web-console"]
==== Querying metrics in the web console (Technology Preview)

Querying metrics is now available through the Developer perspective inside the
{product-title} web console.

[id="ocp-4-3-machine-api"]
=== Machine API

[id="ocp-4-3-repair-damaged-machines-machine-health-checking"]
==== Automatically repair damaged machines with machine health checking

A machine instance that is deleted out of band no longer attempts to recreate a
new instance; instead, the machine enters a _failed_ phase. You can
automatically repair damaged machines in a machine pool by configuring and
deploying a machine health check.

The controller that observes a MachineHealthCheck resource checks for the status
that you define. If a machine fails the health check, it is automatically
deleted and a new one is created to take its place. When a machine is deleted,
you see a machine-deleted event. To limit disruptive impact of the machine
deletion, the controller drains and deletes only one node at a time.

To stop the check, you remove the resource.

[id="ocp-4-3-logging"]
=== Logging

[id="ocp-4-3-cluster-logging-log-forwarding"]
==== Log forwarding (Technology Preview)

The Log Forwarding API provides a way to ship container and node logs
to destinations that are not necessarily managed by the {product-title} cluster logging infrastructure.
Destination endpoints can be on or off your {product-title} cluster. Log forwarding provides an easier way to forward
logs than using Fluentd plug-ins without requiring you to set the cluster to Unmanaged.
See
xref:../logging/config/cluster-logging-external.html#cluster-logging-collector-log-forward_cluster-logging-external[Forwarding logs using the Log Forwarding API]
for more information.

[id="ocp-4-3-developer-experience"]
=== Developer experience

[id="ocp-4-3-odo"]
==== OpenShift Do enhancements

OpenShift Do (odo) has a few enhancements that focus on the user experience of
application deployment:

* `PushTimeout` has been added as a configurable wait parameter.
* Both the Service Catalog and component creation have been improved with
extended output and information prompts.
* Architecture support has been expanded to IBM Z and Power platforms,
providing binaries that are available for installation.

[id="ocp-4-3-helm"]
==== Helm (Technology Preview)

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes and {product-title} applications. It uses a
packaging format called Helm charts to simplify defining, installing, and
upgrading of applications and Services.

Helm CLI is built and shipped with {product-title} and is available in the
web console's CLI menu to download.

[id="ocp-4-3-web-console"]
=== Web console

[id="ocp-4-3-new-project-dashboard"]
==== New Project dashboard

The new *Project* dashboard is now available from the Administrator and
Developer perspectives. This dashboard provides the following information about
a project:

* status/health
* external links
* inventory
* utilization
* resource quota
* activity and top consumers

[id="ocp-4-3-console-project-link"]
==== New NamespaceDashboard option in the ConsoleLink Custom Resource Definition

The new location option `NamespaceDashboard` in the ConsoleLink Custom Resource
Definition lets you add project-specific links to the project dashboard.

[id="ocp-4-3-provide-cluster-wide-third-party-interfaces"]
==== Provide cluster-wide third-party user interfaces

You can now integrate cluster-wide third-party user interfaces to develop,
administer, and configure Operator-backed services with the ConsoleLink Custom
Resource Definition.

[id="ocp-4-3-console-yaml-sample"]
==== New ConsoleYAMLSample Custom Resource Definition

The new `ConsoleYAMLSample` Custom Resource Definition provides the ability to
dynamically add YAML examples to any Kubernetes resource at any time.

See
xref:../web_console/customizing-the-web-console.adoc#customizing-web-console[Customizing
the web console] for more information.

[id="ocp-4-3-open-a-support-case"]
==== Open a Support case from the web console

You can now open a Red Hat Support case from the help menu in the web console.

[id="ocp-4-3-view-security-vulnerabilities"]
==== View security vulnerabilities

You can now view your container vulnerabilities from the web console dashboard.
This leverages the Quay Operator, which supports both on-premise and external
Quay registries. Security vulnerabilities are only reported for images managed
by Quay.

[id="ocp-4-3-new-user-management-section"]
==== New User Management section

All user management resources are now available under the *User Resource*
navigation section.

The ability to impersonate a user has also been added, which lets you view
exactly what a user sees when navigating the console.

[id="ocp-4-3-create-alert-receivers"]
==== Create alert receivers

You can now create alert receivers to be informed about your cluster's state.
You can create PagerDuty and webhook alert types.

[id="ocp-4-3-developer-perspective"]
==== Developer perspective

You can now use the Developer perspective to:

* Create serverless applications and revisions, and split traffic between the
revisions.
* Delete an application and all its components.
* Assign RBAC permissions to users within a project.
* Bind an application with a Service using the binding connector.

==== CSI provisioners now shown on storage class creation page

Container Storage Interface (CSI) provisioners are now shown on the storage
class creation page. Storage classes are hardcoded in the user interface;
CSI-based storage classes are dynamic in nature and do not have static names.
Now, users are able to list CSI-based provisioners in the storage class creation
page and can also create one.

[id="ocp-4-3-networking"]
=== Networking

[id="ocp-4-3-configure-network-policy"]
==== Configure network policy

The Kubernetes `v1` NetworkPolicy features are available in {product-title}
except for egress policy types and IPBlock.

IPBlock is supported in NetworkPolicy with limitations; it supports IPBlock
without `except` clauses. If you create a policy with an `ipBlock` section
including an `except` clause, the SDN Pods log warnings, and the entire
`ipBlock` section of that policy is ignored.

[id="ocp-4-3-kuryr-cni-support-for-rhosp"]
==== Kuryr CNI support for {rh-openstack-first}

You can install a customized cluster on {rh-openstack} 13 and 16 that uses Kuryr
SDN. You can follow the installation guide for
xref:../installing/installing_openstack/installing-openstack-installer-kuryr.adoc#installing-openstack-installer-kuryr[installing a cluster on OpenStack with Kuryr].

[id="ocp-4-3-scale"]
=== Scale

[id="ocp-4-3-scale-cluster-limits"]
==== Cluster maximums

Updated guidance around
xref:../scalability_and_performance/planning-your-environment-according-to-object-maximums.adoc#planning-your-environment-according-to-object-maximums[Cluster
maximums] for {product-title} {product-version} is now available.

Use the link:https://access.redhat.com/labs/ocplimitscalculator/[{product-title}
Limit Calculator] to estimate cluster limits for your environment.

[id="ocp-4-3-storage"]
=== Storage

[id="ocp-4-3-ocs-4-2"]
==== OpenShift Container Storage 4.2

You can now deploy, manage, monitor, and migrate a Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage 4.2 cluster. See the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_container_storage/4.2/html/4.2_release_notes/[Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage 4.2 Release Notes] for more information.

[id="ocp-4-3-iscsi-persistent-storage"]
==== Persistent storage Using iSCSI

Persistent volumes using iSCSI, previously in Technology Preview, is now fully supported in {product-title} 4.3.

[id="ocp-4-3-raw-block-volume"]
==== Raw block volume support

iSCSI raw block volumes, previously in Technology Preview, are now fully supported with OpenShift Container Platform 4.3.

Raw block volumes using Cinder are now in Technology Preview.

[id="ocp-4-3-csi-volume-expansion"]
==== CSI volume expansion

You can now use the Container Storage Interface (CSI) to expand storage volumes after they have already been created. This feature is enabled by default in Technology Preview.

[id="ocp-4-3-lso-tolerations"]
==== Use tolerations in Local Storage Operator

The Local Storage Operator now tolerates node taints, allowing you to provision local volumes from tainted nodes.

[id="ocp-4-3-operators"]
=== Operators

[id="ocp-4-3-samples-operator"]
==== Samples Operator

The Samples Operator automatically recognizes the cluster architecture during
installation and does not install incompatible x86_64 content on Power and Z
architectures.

The Samples Operator also uses Prometheus metrics to gather information about
which imagestreams have failed to import, and if the Samples Operator has
invalid configurations. An alert is sent if an imagestream fails to import or
the Samples Operator has an invalid configuration.

[id="ocp-4-3-image-registry-operator"]
==== Image Registry Operator

The following enhancements are now available for the Image Registry Operator:

* The registry management state is set as `Removed` on Baremetal, vSphere, and
Red Hat Virtualization platforms so other storage providers can be configured.
New installations must set the registry state to `Managed` in addition to
provisioning storage.

* An alert is sent when the registry storage has changed, as this could result
in data loss.

[id="ocp-4-3-simplified-mirroring-of-operatorhub"]
==== Simplified mirroring of OperatorHub

Assuming there is a registry running in a disconnected environment available to
both the disconnected cluster and to the workstation from which the `oc adm`
commands are run, you can now mirror the OperatorHub by following three steps:

. Mirror the Operator catalog into the container image and push to the
disconnected registry using `oc adm catalog build`.

. Parse the referenced Operator and app images and push to the disconnected
registry using `oc adm catalog mirror`.

. Enable the mirror catalog in the disconnected cluster using
`oc apply -f ./manifests`.

See xref:../operators/olm-restricted-networks.html#olm-restricted-networks[Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks]
for details.

[id="ocp-4-3-operator-telemetry-and-alerts"]
==== Operator telemetry and alerts

The Lifecycle Operator Manager (OLM) now reports installed Operator information.
For example, the OLM sends alerts about Operators transitioning into the failure
state.

[id="ocp-4-3-notable-technical-changes"]
== Notable technical changes

{product-title} {product-version} introduces the following notable technical
changes.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-3-osdk"]
==== Operator SDK v0.12.0

{product-title} 4.3 supports Operator SDK v0.12.0 or later.

The Operator test tooling (scorecard v2) now includes the following
improvements:

* Categorizing Operator tests as required/optional.
* Configuring test selection and pass/fail behavior.
* Shipping custom tests.

For Helm-based Operators, improvements include

* Helm v3 support, starting with Operator SDK 0.14.0.
* Role-based access control (RBAC) generation.

Ansible-based Operator enhancements include

* Support for Prometheus metrics.
* Usage of Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI).
* Molecule-based end to end testing.

Lastly, the Golang-based Operator improvements include

* OpenAPI spec generation.
* Kubernetes 1.14 support.
* Removal of `dep`-based projects. All Go projects are now scaffolded to use Go
modules. The `operator-sdk new` command's `--dep-manager` flag has been removed.
* Required link:https://golang.org/dl[Go] version update from v1.10 to v1.13.
* Support for Prometheus metrics.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-3-cluster-logging-changes"]
==== Cluster logging Fluent *forward* configuration changes

Changes introduced by the new xref:../logging/config/cluster-logging-external.html#cluster-logging-collector-log-forward_cluster-logging-external[Log Forwarding API] modified the support for the Fluentd *forward* protocol starting with the {product-title} 4.3 release. For the 4.3 release, you can still use the xref:../logging/config/cluster-logging-external.adoc#cluster-logging-collector-fluentd_cluster-logging-external[Fluentd *forward* protocol], without using the new log forwarding feature, which is in Technology Preview.

To use the Fluentd *forward* protocol, you must create a ConfigMap object to configure *out_forward* instead of editing the `secure-forward.conf` section in the `fluentd` ConfigMap.
Additionally, you can add any certificates required by your configuration to a secret that is mounted to the Fluentd Pods. See xref:../logging/config/cluster-logging-external.adoc#cluster-logging-fluentd-external_cluster-logging-external[Sending logs to external devices using Fluentd Forward plug-ins].

In 4.3, the Fluentd *forward* method is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

When you update to {product-title} 4.3, any existing modifications to the `secure-forward.conf` section of the `fluentd` ConfigMap are removed. You can copy your current `secure-forward.conf` section before updating to use when creating the `secure-forward` ConfigMap object.

[id="ocp-4-3-unsupported-features"]
=== Unsupported features

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-3-cluster-logging-es-external"]
==== Cluster logging no longer allows forwarding logs by editing the Fluentd Daemonset

Due to changes introduced by the new Log Forwarding API, you can no longer forward logs to an external Elasticsearch instance by editing the Fluentd DaemonSet.

In previous versions, you could use the `ES_HOST` and `OPS_HOST` environment variables or configure the `fluent-plugin-remote-syslog` plug-in through the `fluentd` Daemonset.

You can forward logs to an external Elasticsearch instance and other endpoints using the new xref:../logging/config/cluster-logging-external.html#cluster-logging-collector-log-forward_cluster-logging-external[Log Forwarding API] feature or the xref:../logging/config/cluster-logging-external.adoc#cluster-logging-collector-fluentd_cluster-logging-external[Fluentd *forward* protocol]. The documentation is now updated to reflect these changes.

[id="ocp-4-3-local-provisioner"]
==== Local storage provisioner

The previously deprecated Technical Preview of the `ose-local-storage-provisioner` container has been removed. It is recommended to use the OLM-based Local Storage Operator (`ose-local-storage-operator`).

[id="ocp-4-3-pv-snapshots"]
==== Persistent volume snapshots

Persistent volume snapshots were deprecated in {product-title} 4.2 and have been removed in {product-title} 4.3.

[id="ocp-4-3-deprecated-features"]
=== Deprecated features

[id="ocp-4-3-pipelines-now-deprecated"]
==== Pipelines build strategy

The pipelines build strategy is now deprecated. Use OpenShift Pipelines
instead.

[id="ocp-4-3-beta-workload-alerts-deprecated"]
==== Beta workload alerts

The `apps/v1beta1`, `apps/v1beta2`, and `extensions/v1beta1` workloads are now
deprecated with the introduction of Kubernetes 1.16.

The `UsingDeprecatedAPIExtensionsV1Beta1` alert is prompted when you use one of
the deprecated APIs. These deprecated APIs will be removed in the next version
of {product-title}, so it is critical that you migrate to supported APIs.

[id="ocp-4-3-service-catalog-deprecated"]
==== Service Catalog, Template Service Broker, Ansible Service Broker, and their Operators

Service Catalog, Template Service Broker, Ansible Service Broker, and their
associated Operators were deprecated in {product-title} 4.2 and will be removed
in a future {product-title} release. If they are enabled in 4.3, the web console
now warns the user that these features are still enabled.

The following alerts can be viewed from the *Monitoring* -> *Alerts* page and
have a *Warning* severity:

* `ServiceCatalogAPIServerEnabled`
* `ServiceCatalogControllerManagerEnabled`
* `TemplateServiceBrokerEnabled`
* `AnsibleServiceBrokerEnabled`

The following related APIs will be removed in a future release:

* `.servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1beta1`
* `.automationbroker.io/v1alpha1`
* `.osb.openshift.io/v1`

[id="ocp-4-3-deprecation-of-operatorsources"]
==== Deprecation of OperatorSources and CatalogSourceConfigs

OperatorSources and CatalogSourceConfigs are deprecated from OperatorHub. The
following related APIs will be removed in a future release:

* `operatorsources.operators.coreos.com/v1`
* `catalogsourceconfigs.operators.coreos.com/v2`
* `catalogsourceconfigs.operators.coreos.com/v1`

[id="ocp-4-3-virtualbox-for-crc"]
==== VirtualBox support for CodeReady Containers

The support for using VirtualBox with CodeReady Containers (CRC) is now
deprecated.

[id="ocp-4-3-bug-fixes"]
== Bug fixes

*Authentication*

* The Authentication Operator reported a static "available" string as a reason
for the unavailability condition, which was unclear. This bug fix implements
more precise reasons for unavailability conditions, and as a result, inspecting
why the Operator is unavailable is more clear.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1740357[*BZ#1740357*])

* The `oauth-proxy` process was reloading CA certificates for each request and
storing them in memory. High memory consumption caused the `oauth-proxy`
container to be killed. With this bug fix, CA certificates are now cached unless
they change. As a result, memory consumption for the `oauth-proxy` process has
dropped significantly when multiple requests against it are issued.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1759169[*BZ#1759169*])

* Previously, the client CA certificate configured for the RequestHeader
identity provider (IdP) was not announced among other certificates during TLS
handshake with the OAuth server. When `login-proxies` tried to connect to the
OAuth server, they would not use their client certificate, resulting in their
request being unauthenticated, which in turn caused users of the IdP being
unable to log in to the cluster. This bug fix adds the configured client CA
among the rest in the TLS configuration, and as a result, authentication using
the RequestHeader IdP works as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1764558[*BZ#1764558*])

* The bootstrap user introduced in OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.1
internally made CLI log flow always available. The message about how to retrieve
an authentication token, which was there in OCP 3.x, no longer appeared for
users that tried to log in from CLI in cases where only web console flows were
configured. With this bug fix, the bootstrap user identity provider (IdP) is no
longer configured when it is disabled by the user. As a result, after the
bootstrap IdP is disabled by following the steps from the OCP documentation, the
message about how to retrieve an authentication token in web console-only
scenarios is now displayed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1781083[*BZ#1781083*])

* Previously, the route to oauth-server did not react to Ingress domain changes,
which degraded the Authentication Operator and caused the oauth-server to not
authenticate properly. The oauth-server route now updates when an Ingress domain
change is detected, allowing authentication to work in this scenario.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1707905[*BZ#1707905*])

*Builds*

* Builds started very soon after an imagestream was created might not leverage
local pullthrough imagestream tags when specified. The build attempts to pull
the image from the external image registry, and if the build is not set up with
the authorization and certificates needed for that registry, the build would
fail. The build controller is now updated to detect when its imagestream cache
is missing the necessary information to allow for local pullthrough imagestream
tags and retrieve that information from other means. Builds can now successfully
leverage local imagestream tag pullthrough.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1753731[*BZ#1753731*])

* The build controller sometimes incorrectly assumed a build was instantiated
from the build config endpoint when it was actually instantiated directly from
the build endpoint. Therefore, confusing logging about non-existent build
configs could appear in the build controller logs if a user instantiated an
OpenShift build directly, as opposed to initiating a build request off of the
build config API endpoint. The build controller is now updated to better check
whether a build was instantiated from the build config endpoint and refrain from
logging unnecessary error messages.The build controller logs no longer have
these confusing error messages for build instantiated directly versus from the
build config endpoint.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1767218[*BZ#1767218*]),
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1767219[*BZ#1767219*])

*Cluster Version Operator*

* Previously, the update protocol Cincinnati, designed to facilitate automatic
updates, used tags for payload references. This could yield different results
when applying the same release of the same graph at different points. Now the
payload reference uses the image SHA instead, if the container registry provides
the `manifestref`. This guarantees the exact release version a cluster is going
to use. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1686589[*BZ#1686589*])

*Console Kubevirt Plugin*

* Previously, the specified `volumeMode` was not passed to newly created disks,
so PVCs might not bind properly. The `volumeMode` is now passed properly to the
newly created disks.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1753688[*BZ#1753688*])

* Previously, the virtual machine detail page did not load properly when
accessed directly by the URL. The page now loads properly.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1731480[*BZ#1731480*])

* Previously, the `kubevirt-storage-class-defaults` ConfigMap setting was not
reflected properly for VMware VM imports. Because of this, `blockMode` PVCs
could not be used for VMware VM imports. The storage class defaults are now used
properly when requesting VMware imported disks.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1762217[*BZ#1762217*])

* Previously, the title for the Import VM wizard was incorrect and could be
confusing. The wizard now has the correct title of *Import Virtual Machine*.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1768442[*BZ#1768442*])

* Previously, the confirmation buttons for storage and network configuration in
the VM migration wizard were located in the wrong place. These confirmation
buttons are now located in the correct location.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1778783[*BZ#1778783*])

* Previously, the *Create Virtual Machine* wizard did not prompt for
confirmation before creating a VM, which meant the user could unexpectedly
create a VM. With this fix, the user must click "Create Virtual Machine" on the
review page before a VM is created.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1674407[*BZ#1674407*])

* Previously, the *Create Virtual Machine* wizard had required fields that were
not always intuitive when importing a VM. The *Create Virtual Machine* wizard
has been redesigned to work as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1710939[*BZ#1710939*])

* Previously, error messages for validating VM names were not helpful. These
error messages have been improved to be more descriptive.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1743938[*BZ#1743938*])

*Containers*

* Previously, CRI-O was not properly filtering Podman containers during a
restore operation. Because Podman containers do not have CRI-O-specific
metadata, at startup, CRI-O would interpret the Podman containers it saw as
CRI-O containers that were incorrectly created. It would therefore ask the
storage library to delete the containers. This bug fix now properly filters
Podman containers on CRI-O restore so that they are no longer deleted from
storage upon startup.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1758500[*BZ#1758500*])

*Etcd*

* Etcd would become overloaded with a large number of objects, causing the
cluster to go down when etcd failed. Now, the etcd client balancer facilitates
peer failovers in the event of a client connection timeout.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1706103[*BZ#1706103*])

* Etcd would fail during the upgrade process and result in disaster recovery
remediation steps. Now, etcd has been updated to resolve gRPC package to prevent
catastrophic cluster failure.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1733594[*BZ#1733594*])

*Image Registry*

* After changing the storage type in the image registry Operator's
configuration, both the previous and new storage types appeared Operator's
status. Because of this behavior, the image registry Operator was not removed
after you deleted its configuration. Now only the new storage type is displayed,
so the image registry Operator is removed after you change the storage type that
the image uses.
link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1722878[*BZ#1722878*])

* Because it was possible for older imagestreams to have invalid names, image
pruning failed when the specs for the imagestream's tags were invalid. Now, the
image pruner always prune images when the associated imagestream has an invalid
name. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1749256[*BZ#1749256*])

* When the image registry operator's management state was `Removed`, it did not
report itself as Available or the correct version number. Because of this issue,
upgrades failed when the image registry operator was set to `Removed`. Now when
you set the image registry Operator's status to `Removed`, it reports itself as
Available and at the correct version. You can complete upgrades even if you
remove the image registry from the cluster.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1753778[*BZ#1753778*])

* It was possible to configure the image registry Operator with an invalid Azure
container name, and the image registry did not deploy on Azure because of the
invalid name. Now the image registry Operator's API schema ensures that the
Azure container name that you enter conforms to Azure's API requirements and is
valid, which ensures that the Operator can deploy.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1750675[*BZ#1750675*])

*kube-apiserver*

* An unnecessary service monitoring object was created for each of the following
contollers: kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, and kube-scheduler. The
unused service monitoring object is no longer created.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1735509[*BZ#1735509*])

* When a cluster is in a non-upgradeable state because either Technology Preview
features or custom features are enabled, no alert was sent. The cluster will now
send a `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` alert through Prometheus if an upgrade is
attempted on a cluster in a non-upgradeable state.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1731228[*BZ#1731228*])

*kube-controller-manager*

* When defining a StatefulSet resource object, custom labels were not applied
when creating PersistentVolumeClaim resource objects from the template specified
by `volumeClaimTemplates` parameter. Custom labels are now applied correctly to
PersistentVolumeClaim objects created from the `volumeClaimTemplates` objects
defined by a StatefulSet resource.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1753467[*BZ#1753467*])

* Previously, if the lease ConfigMap for the Kubernetes Controller Manager (KCM)
was deleted, KCM did not have permission to recreate the ConfigMap and was
unable to do so. The KCM can now recreate the lease ConfigMap if it is deleted.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1780843[*BZ#1780843*])

*Logging*

* Mismatches between cluster version and ClusterLogging version would cause
ClusterLogging to fail to deploy. Now, the kubeversion is verified that it
supports the deployed ClusterLogging version.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1765261[*BZ#1765261*])

* The data in journald for facility values was not sanitized and values were
incorrect, causing fluentd to emit error messages at the wrong level. Now,
fluentd logs at the debug level and these errors are reported correctly.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1753936[*BZ#1753936*],link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1766187[*BZ#1766187*])

* The oauth-proxy was misconfigured in a way that users were unable to log in
after logging out. Now, the oauth-proxy has been reconfigured so that users can
log in again after logging out.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1725517[*BZ#1725517*])

* Eventrouter was not able to handle unknown event types, which would result in
Eventrouter crashing. Now, Eventrouter properly handles unknown event types.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1753568[*BZ#1753568*])

*Management Console*

* The Management Console Dashboard Details were unnecessarily watching the
Infrastructure resources. As a result, errors regarding early web socket
connection terminations were possible. Now, the Details card does not watch
Infrastructure resources and only fetches the resource data once. Errors are not
reported after implementing this fix.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1765083[*BZ#1765083*])

* The console Operator would record an initial empty string value for the console
URL before the router had a chance to provide the host name. Now, the Operator
waits until the hostname is filled and eliminates the empty string value.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1768684[*BZ#1768684*])

*Metering Operator*

* Previously, the `containerImage` field in the `metering-operator` CSV bundle
referenced an image tag that was not listed in the `image-references` file that
ART uses for substitution purposes. This meant that ART wasn't able to properly
substitute the origin image listed in the `containerImage field` with the
associated `image-registry` repository and `sha256` tag. This bug fix replaces
the image tag `latest` with `release-4.3`, which is what was defined in the
`image-references` file. As a result, ART is now able to successfully substitute
the `metering-operator` container image.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1782237[*BZ#1782237*])

* Previously, Hadoop `Dockerfile.rhel` copied the `gcs-connector` JAR file to
the wrong location in the container. The path has been corrected to now point to
the right location.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1767629[*BZ#1767629*])

*Networking*

* Previously, not all related objects were deleted when the CNO was changed,
which left stale network-attachment-definitions. The code has been refactored to
now do this in a more generic way in {product-title} 4.3 so that the related
objects are cleaned up properly.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1755586[*BZ#1755586*])

* Previously, some updates were dropped which caused events to be missed. Events
are no longer dropped.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1747532[*BZ#1747532*])

* Previously, in clusters that had high network traffic volumes with packet loss,
a once-successful connection to a service could fail with a *Connection reset by
peer* error. As a result, clients had to reconnect and retransmit. An update has
been made to iptables rules to process TCP retransmits correctly. Established
connections will remain open until they are closed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1762298[*BZ#1762298*])

* Previously, NetworkPolicy rule applications to new namespaces could occur slowly
in clusters that had many namespaces, namespace changes, and NetworkPolicies
that select namespaces. New namespaces could take significant amounts of time
before they could be accessed from other namespaces. Due to an update in
Namespace and NetworkPolicy code, NetworkPolicies should be applied promptly to
new namespaces.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1752636[*BZ#1752636*])

* Previously, SDN pods did not clean up Egress IP addresses when they restarted on
a node, resulting in IP address conflicts. SDN pods now clean up stale Egress IP
addresses as they start, preventing such conflicts from occuring. (link:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1753216[*BZ#1753216*])

* Previously, DNS names were queried every time they occured in an
EgressNetworkPolicy. Records were queried regardless of whether a particular DNS
record had been refreshed by a previous query, resulting in slow network
performance. DNS records are now queried based on unique names rather than per
each EgressNetworkPolicy. As a result, DNS query performance has been
significantly improved.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1684079[*BZ#1684079*])

* Route creation between multiple service endpoints was not possible from the
console. Now, the GUI has been updated to add or remove up to three alternative
service endpoints.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1725006[*BZ#1725006*])

*Node*

* Previously, when containers had a high (or > 1) restart count, the kubelet
could inject duplicate container metrics into the metrics stream, causing the
`/metrics` endpoint on the kubelet to throw a 500 error. With this bug fix, only
metrics of the most current container (running or stopped) are included. As a
result, the `/metrics` endpoint now allows metrics to flow to Prometheus without
causing a 500 error.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1779285[*BZ#1779285*])

* Upstream changes were made to the long path names test. Pods with names longer
than 255 character were not logged and no warning was issued. Now, the long
names test is removed and Pods with names longer than 255 characters will
log as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1711544[*BZ#1711544*])

* The `LocalStorageCapacityIsolation` feature was disabled, and users were unable
to use the `Statefulset.emptyDir.sizeLimit` parameter. Now, the
`LocalStorageCapacityIsolation` feature has been enabled and the
`Statefulset.emptyDir.sizeLimit` parameter can be set.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1758434[*BZ#1758434*])

*oc*

* Previously when using server-side print, the wide output option was ignored
when used in a watch (`oc get clusteroperators -o wide`). The operation has been
fixed to now properly recognize all the possible options when using server-side
print. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1685189[*BZ#1685189*])

* The `oc explain` command links to upstream documentation were out of date.
These links have been updated and are now valid.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=17227781[*BZ#1727781*])

* Full usage menu information was printed along with bad flag error messages,
causing the error message to be lost at times. Now, when the `oc command --help`
command is run, the bad flag error is the only information displayed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1748777[*BZ#1748777*])

* The `oc status` command was not displaying DaemonSets in a consistent format
due to missing status code information. Now, the Daemonsets, Deployments, and
Deployment Configurations are printed properly in the output of the `oc status`
command.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1540560[*BZ#1540560*])

* The commands `oc version` and `oopenshift-install version` would show as Dirty
due to incorectly set flags. These flags have been updated and the commands no
longer display a Dirty `GitTreeState` or `GitVersion`.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1715001[*BZ#1715001*])

* The `oc status` command would suggest `oc set probe pod` to verify pods are
still running, including pods that may have been owned by controllers. Now, pods
that are owned by controllers are ignored for probe suggestions.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1712697[*BZ#1712697*])

* Previously, the `oc new-build` help command was not properly filtering flags.
This caused irrelevant flags to be printed when invoking `oc new-build --help`.
This has been fixed, and now the help command only prints relevant output.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1737392[*BZ#1737392*])

*openshift-apiserver*

* The `ClusterResourceQuota` in 4.2 and 4.3 were not allowing non-strings as
limit values because the OpenAPI schema was wrong. Therefore, integer quota
values could not be set in `ClusterResourceQuota` objects, even though doing so
was previously possible in 4.1. The OpenAPI schema for `ClusterResourceQuota`
has been fixed to allow integers so that integers can now be used as quota
values in `ClusterResourceQuota` again.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1756417[*BZ#1756417*])

* During upgrades, `openshift-apiserver` would report `degraded`. The reason for
degradation was `MultipleAvailable`, but this was not understandable to the
user. This bug fix now lists the reason for the degradation, so that no
information is hidden from the user.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1767156[*BZ#1767156*])

*Web Console*

* The console workload shows a restricted access error if the knative
serverless TP1 Operator is installed and you are logged in as non-admin user.
With this bug fix, the Overview sidebar resources now work as expected for both
normal and knative-specific deployments. A non-admin user can now view the
workloads.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1758628[*BZ#1758628*])

* The topology view data model was originally a subset of the project Workloads
page. As more feature were added, the topology view grew to be similar but did
not share the same code. As use cases became more complex, certain edge cases
were being missed in the new code. In certain situations, the Pod list from the
topology view was incorrect. With this bug fix, code logic is now shared between
the topology view and project Workloads page. As a result, whether viewing the
sidebar Pod list from topology or from the project Workloads list, the Pod
details are now identical.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1760827[*BZ#1760827*])

* Previously, when the Route object was created, the first port from the list of
available ports was set instead of setting the selected port from the
target-port dropdown menu. Because of this, the user was unable to select their
desired target port. The port selected from the target port dropdown menu is now
applied when creating a Route object; if no port is selected, the first port
from the list is set.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1760836[*BZ#1760836*])

* Previously, certain features, such as the name of the application and the
build status, were not rendered in the *Topology* view on the Edge browser. With
this bug fix, the Edge browser renders the application name and the build status
as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1760858[*BZ#1760858*])

* In the web console Overview, a non-admin user was not able to view workloads
when the Knative Operator was installed, even if a deployment that was not a
Knative workload was selected. This bug fix adds a check in case there are no
configurations found so that the system will not add Knative-specific resources
in Overview. This enables a non-admin user to now view the workloads as
expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1760810[*BZ#1760810*])

* Previously, when the Topology context menu was open, the associated node was
not easily identifiable. This caused confusion for users because they did not
know which node the context menu referred to. Now when right-clicking a node to
open the context menu, a visual hover, or drop shadow, is applied to the node
for easier identification.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1776401[*BZ#1776401*])

* Previously, the *Import from Git* form in the web console used a regular
expression too restrictive to validate the Git URL, which disallowed some valid
URLs. The regular expression has been updated to accept all valid Git URLs.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1766350[*BZ#1766350*]),
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1771851[*BZ#1771851*])

* Error messages from the developer console were duplicated. Now, this system
has been updated to reflect values from the client side. As a result, error
messages are now clear and concise.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1688613[*BZ#1688613*])

* Previously, the web console could experience a runtime error when visiting the
Resources tab of an OLM operand resource. The web console could also freeze when
trying to sort the Resources tab for an OLM operand resource. These issues are
now resolved.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1756319[*BZ#1756319*])

* Previously, visiting the OpenShift web console pod details page in Microsoft
Edge could result in a runtime error, preventing the page from displaying. The
issue is now resolved and the pod details page now displays correctly.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1768654[*BZ#1768654*])

* Previously, if a dashboard card watched Prometheus results, the dashboard
page's performance could decrease due to an incorrect comparison between old
alerts and new alerts. The comparison defect has been fixed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1781053[*BZ#1781053*])

* In previous versions, the documentation link on the Network Policy page was
incorrect. It has been replaced with the correct link.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1692227[*BZ#1692227*])

* Previously, Prometheus queries contained a range selector, which prevented the
chart on the default page of the Prometheus UI from rendering. The queries no
longer contain range selectors, so the query now renders properly.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1746979[*BZ#1746979*])

* `Recycle` was the default value for the Persistent Volume Reclaim policy even
though that option was deprecated. Persistent Volumes contained deprecated
values by default. The default Persistent Volume Reclaim policy is now
`Retain`, so new Persistent Volumes do not contain deprecated values.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1751647[*BZ#1751647*])

* Previously, after upgrading your cluster, the web console could use cached CSS
stylesheets, which might cause some rendering issues when loading the console.
The problem has been fixed, and the web console now correctly uses the correct
stylesheets after an upgrade.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1772687[*BZ#1772687*])

* Previously, when using the web console in some situations part of the options
menu was hidden behind other elements on the page. The options menu no longer
appears behind other page elements and will expand in a viewable space on the page
to ensure the entire menu is always visible.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1723254[*BZ#1723254*])

* Previously, long node names could overflow the table column in the OpenShift
console pods table. With this bug fix, they now correctly wrap.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1713193[*BZ#1713193*])

* Previously, creating a report query using an example YAML would result in an
error. This bug fix adds a new YAML example for report queries that contains all
required fields so that an error does not occur.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1753124[*BZ#1753124*])

* Previously on the Install Plan Details page, the namespace for associated
catalog sources was set incorrectly. This resulted in broken links because the
namespace did not exist. This bug fix uses the `status.plan` field of the
InstallPlan resource to associate the catalog source with the correct namespace
to build links from. Thus, the catalog source links now work as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1767072[*BZ#1767072*])

* Previously, unknown custom resources were automatically split into words to
estimate what the user should see. However, some resources were split
inappropriately. With this bug fix, custom resources now use the name as defined
in the Custom Resource Definition, rather than being split into separate
words.(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1722811[*BZ#1722811*])

== Known issues

* If you have Service Mesh installed, upgrade Service Mesh before upgrading
{product-title}. For a workaround, see
xref:../service_mesh/service_mesh_install/updating-ossm.adoc#updating-ossm[Updating OpenShift
Service Mesh from version 1.0.1 to 1.0.2].
* Determination of active Pods when a rollout fails can be incorrect in the *Topology* view. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1760828[*BZ#1760828*])
* When a user with limited cluster-wide permissions creates an application using the *Container Image* option in the *Add* page, and chooses the *Image name from internal registry* option, no imagestreams are detected in the project, though an imagestream exists. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1784264[*BZ#1784264*])
* The `ImageContentSourcePolicy` is not supported by the registry at the time of
release (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1787112[*BZ#1787112*]).
In disconnected environments, Jenkins can be enabled to pull through by
default. Use this command as a workaround to use Jenkins in disconnected
environments:

* The OpenShift Cluster Version Operator (CVO) does not correctly mount SSL certificates from the host, which prevents cluster version updates when using MITM proxy checking. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1773419[*BZ#1773419*])
* When adding `defaultProxy` and `gitProxy` under `builds.config.openshift.io`ï¼Œ
the Jenkins pipeline build cannot retrieve the proxy configuration. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1753562[*BZ#1753562*])

* The public cloud access image for RHEL cannot be used directly if you enable FIPS mode. This is caused by public cloud images not allowing kernel integrity checks. To do this, you must upload your own images. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1788051[*BZ#1788051*])
* The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) does not work in {product-title} when Kuryr SDN is enabled. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1786217[*BZ#1786217*])
* The `oc adm catalog build` and `oc adm catalog mirror` commands do not work for the restricted cluster. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1773821)[*BZ#1773821*])

* When upgrading a {product-title} cluster from  4.1 to 4.2 to 4.3, there is a
possibility that the Node Tuning Operator tuned Pods can get stuck in the
`ContainerCreating` state.
+
To confirm the issue, run:
+
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
----
+
One or more tuned Pods are stuck in the `ContainerCreating` state.
+
To resolve the issue, apply the following workaround. Run:
+
----
$ oc delete daemonset/tuned -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
$ oc get daemonset/tuned -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
$ oc get pods -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator

Verify that the Pods are now in a `Running` state.

* The Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Operator version 4.3 fails to deploy from
OpertorHub on the {product-title} web console. As a workaround, download the
`oc` client for your operating system, and place the `kubeconfig` file from the
installer in `~/.kube/config`. Run these commands to deploy the NFD Operator
from the CLI and GitHub:
+
----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/openshift
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/cluster-nfd-operator.git
$ cd cluster-nfd-operator

* If a cluster-wide egress proxy is configured and then later unset, Pods for
applications that have been previously deployed by OLM-managed Operators can
enter a `CrashLoopBackOff` state. This is caused by the deployed Operator still
being configured to rely on the proxy.
+
[NOTE]
====
This issue applies for environment variables, Volumes, and VolumeMounts created
by the cluster-wide egress proxy. This same issue occurs when setting
environment variables, Volumes, and VolumeMounts using the SubscriptionsConfig
object.
====
+
A fix is planned for a future release of
{product-title}, however you can workaround the issue by deleting the Deployment
using the CLI or web console. This triggers OLM to regenerate the Deployment and
starts up Pods with the correct networking configuration.
+
Cluster administrators can get a list of all affected OLM-managed Deployments by
running the following command:
+
----
$ oc get deployments --all-namespaces \
    -l olm.owner,olm.owner!=packageserver <1>
----
<1> Exclude `packageserver`, which is unaffected.
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1751903[*BZ#1751903*])

* There is an issue with the Machine Config Operator (MCO) supporting Day 2
proxy support, which describes when an existing non-proxied
cluster is reconfigured to use a proxy. The MCO should apply newly configured
proxy CA certificates in a ConfigMap to the {op-system} trust bundle; this is
not working. As a workaround, you must manually add the proxy CA certificate to
your trust bundle and then update the trust bundle:
+
----
$ cp /opt/registry/certs/<my_root_ca>.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
$ update-ca-trust extract
$ oc adm drain <node>
$ systemctl reboot

==== Bug Fixes

* Amazon Web Services (AWS) installer-provisioned infrastructure and
{rh-openstack-first} user-provisioned infrastructure were missing security group
rules allowing bi-directional traffic between control plane hosts and workers on
TCP and UDP ports 30000-32767. This caused newly introduced OVN Networking
components to not work properly in clusters lacking these security group rules.
Now security group rules are available to allow the aforementioned
bi-directional traffic support. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1779469[*BZ#1779469*])

* Previously, users would be given a _Restricted Access_ error when trying to
access the *Installed Operators* page in the web console. This happened because
the console was trying to access the subscription resource outside of the
current namespace to show subscription details. Users can now access the
*Installed Operators* page. The *Subscription* tab will be hidden from users who
can not access the subscription resource. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1791101[*BZ#1791101*])

[[ocp-4-3-18-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* Previously, the web console would fail to show an operand if an invalid OLM
descriptor was set by an Operator. The web console now tolerates invalid
descriptors and shows the operand details.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1798130[*BZ#1798130*])

* Previously, the web console would display the *Create Project* action for
users that did not have permissions to create projects. This was confusing
because users without the proper permissions would try to create a project and
would be met with error messaging stating they could not create a project. The
*Create Project* action is no longer visible to users that do not have permission
to create a project.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1804708[*BZ#1804708*])

* The `Upgradeable` field was not being properly set by the Service Catalog
Operators. This would display an incorrect upgrade status of `Unknown` after a
fresh {product-title} cluster installation. The `Upgradeable` field is now
properly set so a cluster's upgrade status is now accurate.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1813488[*BZ#1813488*])

* The Image Registry Operator was not reporting new versions of {product-title}
if the Operator was set to `Unmanaged`. This caused upgrades to newer cluster
versions to fail. Now when the Image Registry Operator is set to `Unmanaged`,
new cluster versions are reported, allowing for successful upgrades.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1816656[*BZ#1816656*])

* Previously, the web console was experiencing runtime errors on certain pages
due to the ts-loader using the incorrect `tsconfig.json` in some cases. The
ts-loader issue is resolved, allowing all web console pages to load properly.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1818980[*BZ#1818980*])

* Previously, the client used to create pull secrets for the {product-title}
internal registry had a low rate limit. If a large number of namespaces were
created in a short time window, it would take a long time for image registry
pull secrets to be created. The client's rate limit has been increased, so
internal registry pull secrets are now created quickly, even with high traffic.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1819850[*BZ#1819850*])

* Previously, the node-ca daemon did not tolerate the `NoExecute` taint. This
caused the node-ca daemon to ignore certificates on nodes that had the
`NoExecute` taint applied. This bug fix syncs the `additionalTrustedCA` to all
nodes with taints, allowing all taints to be tolerated.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1820242[*BZ#1820242*])

* The `oc` command for refreshing the CA certificate was missing the resource
type on which to operate. This caused the command to return errors. The missing
ConfigMap is now added, fixing the command errors.

==== Known issues

* Because of issues with `coreos-installer`, CoreOS cannot be installed on
bare-metal nodes that use NVMe drives with 4K sectors.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1805249[*BZ#1805249*])

* There is an issue with the `fw_enabled_large_send` setting on IBM Power
systems that is causing VXLAN packet drop and can cause deployments to fail.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1816254[*BZ#1816254*])

* For clusters on an IBM Power infrastructure, due to
missing packages related to hotplug devices, guest virtual machines
might not detect dynamically-provisioned persistent volumes.
As a result, you need to install the following packages and services:
`librtas`, `powerpc-utils`, and `ppc64-diag`.

link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5061361[{product-title} 4.3.19 container image list]

[[ocp-4-3-19-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* Previously, if an imagestream was backed by a private registry that the
internal image registry had credentials for, but the consumer did not have
credentials for, the subsequent image pull would fail. Because local reference
settings on imagestreams were ignored if imagestream access occurred soon after
cluster startup or restart of the OpenShift controller manager, the controller
manager would store imagestreams in its cache with incomplete metadata. The
OpenShift controller manager has been updated to refresh its imagestream cache
if its metadata initialization was incomplete. This preserves the local
reference imagestream policy even during the timing windows that occur
immediately after cluster start or OpenShift controller manager restart.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1813420[*BZ#1813420*])

* Previously, the OpenShift console Pod terminal did not correctly handle
Unicode characters. This problem has been fixed, and Unicode characters now
display correctly.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821647[*BZ#1821647*])

* A Multus-related DaemonSet mistakenly used the deprecated version
`extensions/v1beta1` rather than `apps/v1` in its YAML definition. This sent an
alert for clusters that had the deprecated API usage alert enabled. The
DaemonSet has been updated to use the correct version name; therefore, the
deprecated API usage alert is no longer sent.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1824866[*BZ#1824866*])

* Before starting a build, the {product-title} builder would parse the supplied
Dockerfile and reconstruct a modified version of it to use for the build. This
process included adding labels and handling substitutions of the images named in
`FROM` instructions. The generated Dockerfile did not always correctly
reconstruct `ENV` and `LABEL` instructions; sometimes the generated Dockerfile
would include `=` characters, although the original Dockerfile did not include
them. This caused the build to fail with a syntax error. When generating the
modified Dockerfile, the original text for `ENV` and `LABEL` instructions are
now used verbatim, fixing this issue.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821861[*BZ#1821861*])

* The Node Tuning Operator did not ship with fixes to address tuned daemon
behavior related to link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1702724[*BZ#1702724*]
and link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1774645[*BZ#1774645*]. As a
result, when an invalid profile was specified by the user, a Denial of Service
(DoS) of the operand's functionality occurred. Also, correcting the profile did
not restore the operand's functionality. This was fixed by applying the aforementioned
bug fixes, allowing the tuned daemon to process and set a new, corrected
profile. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1825007[*BZ#1825007*])

* Previously, the OpenStack installer created security groups using
`remote_group_id` to allow traffic origins. Using the `remote_group_id` in the
security rules was very inefficient, triggering a lot of computation by the OVS
agent to generate the flows. This process sometimes exceeded the time allocated
for flow generation. In such cases, especially in environments already under
stress, master nodes would be unable to communicate with worker nodes, leading
the deployment to fail. Now IP prefixes for whitelisting traffic origins are
used instead of the `remote_group_id`. This lessens the load on Neutron
resources, reducing the occurrence of timeouts.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1825973[*BZ#1825973*])

* Previously, tuned Pods did not mount `/etc/sysctl.{conf,d/}` from the host.
This gave the ability for settings provided by the host to be overridden by
tuned profiles. Now `/etc/sysctl.{conf,d/}` is mounted from the host in tuned
Pods, which prevents tuned profiles from overriding the host sysctl settings in
`/etc/sysctl.{conf,d/}`.

[[ocp-4-3-22-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* Previously, installations on the s390x and ppc64le architectures would not
complete successfully because the Samples Operator was failing to report its
version when running on those architectures. This problem has been fixed, and
these installations now complete successfully.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1779934[*BZ#1779934*])

* With this update, several environment variables involving TLS certificates and
 the ETCDCTL API version are written into `/root/.profile`. As a result, when
 users perform `oc rsh`, the etcdctl commands now work without having to set these
 variables manually.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1801430[*BZ#1801430*])

* To prevent problems with one of the registry Pods from affecting registry
availability, the registry now has two replicas by default whenever possible.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1810563[*BZ#1810563*])

* Previously, Machine Health Checks and Machine Config were not visually
separated. A dividing line has been added between these two items.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1819289[*BZ#1819289*])

* Previously, the Fluentd buffer queue was not limited and a high volume of
incoming logs could flood the filesystem of a node and cause it to crash. As a
result, applications would be rescheduled. To prevent this type of crash, the
Fluentd buffer queue is now limited to a fixed amount of chunks per output
(default: 32).
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1824427[*BZ#1824427*], link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1833226[*BZ#1833226*])

* Previously, OpenShift Docker Strategy Builds where the Dockerfile had an ARG
step would panic and fail prior to invoking buildah because the map needed for
processing ARG steps was not initialized. With this update, the map is now
initialized and OpenShift Docker Strategy Builds where the Dockerfile has an ARG
step will not panic prior to invoking buildah.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1832975[*BZ#1832975*])

* Previously, stale ImageStreamImport error messages made it unclear to users
what current ImageStreamImport problems existed. With this update, the logic for
updating ImageStreamImport error messages is enhanced to better determine
whether successive errors were from different root causes, and update the error
messages when appropriate. As a result, users get better guidance after
successive failed attempts on what is needed to fix problems with
ImageStreamImport.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1833019[*BZ#1833019*])

* Previously, the cluster-network-operator did not remove deprecated security
group rules on Kuryr bootstrapping when they were replaced by new rules. As a
result, the deprecated rules were left in place during OCP upgrades between
4.3.z releases. The cluster-network-operator is now updated to remove deprecated
security group rules so that Pods continue to have the correct host VM access
restrictions after 4.3.z upgrades.
