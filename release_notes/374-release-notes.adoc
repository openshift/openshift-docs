== New features

[id="ibm-power-z-374"]
=== {ibm-power}, {ibm-zsystems}, and {ibm-linuxone} support for secured clusters

{product-title-short} version 3.74 extends support for {product-title-short} secured clusters for:

* {osp} 4.12 to IBM Power (ppc64le)
* {osp} 4.10 and 4.12 to IBM zSystems (s390x) and IBM® LinuxONE (s390x)

With {product-title-short} version 3.74, you can secure clusters running on {osp} on {ibm-power}, {ibm-zsystems}, and {ibm-linuxone} by using the {product-title-short} Operator.

[NOTE]
====
* You can now secure {ibm-power}, {ibm-zsystems}, and {ibm-linuxone} clusters with {product-title-short}. Central is not supported at this time.
* The Collector is delivered as a kernel module and eBPF probe for {ibm-power}, but is only delivered as a kernel module for {ibm-zsystems} and {ibm-linuxone}. Red Hat plans to add support for eBPF probes for {ibm-zsystems} and {ibm-linuxone} in a future release.
* {product-title-short} supports scanning {ibm-power}, {ibm-zsystems}, and {ibm-linuxone} images with the following limitations for multi-architecture images:
** When you scan a multi-architecture image with a tag reference, {product-title-short} reports the image scan results of the AMD64 layer.
** When you scan a multi-architecture image with an SHA reference to a specific architecture layer, {product-title-short} reports the image scan results of the specified architecture.
====

[id="clair-v4-374"]
=== Clair scanner version 4 support

Clair is a set of microservices that perform vulnerability scanning of container images associated with multiple Linux operating systems. If you are using Clair version 4 (v4), you can now integrate Clair v4 with {product-title-short} to get image vulnerability data. Integrating Clair v4 enables you to see image vulnerabilities from multiple sources in the {product-title-short} portal and triage them from one place.

[NOTE]
====
* Red Hat has deprecated the previous CoreOS Clair integration in favor of Clair v4 integration.
* The next major version, {product-title-short} 4.0, does not plan to support the link:https://quay.github.io/clair/concepts/authentication.html[JSON Web Token (JWT)-based authentication option] for Clair v4 integration.
====

[id="network-graph-2-374"]
=== Network graph 2.0 (Technology Preview)

:FeatureName: Network graph 2.0
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

{product-title-short} includes a network graph upgrade that provides intuitive navigation, enhanced functionality, and crisp graphs by using the Patternfly library. The new graph provides high-level and detailed information about deployments, network flows, and network policies in your environment. You can view traffic in the graph by selecting one of the following views:

* The *Active traffic* (default) view shows observed traffic, focused on the namespace or specific deployment that you click.
* The *Extraneous flows* view shows potential flows allowed by your network policies, helping you identify missing network policies needed to achieve tighter isolation.

The new views use URLs that are displayed in your browser’s address bar, allowing you to easily navigate, save views as bookmarks, and share links.

Filters and controls help you customize the information that is displayed. You can use the expanded top-level filter to focus on namespaces and deployments of interest. You can also collapse display items in the details tab to reduce clutter. The *Legend* button displays descriptions of the icons used in the graph.

The following image provides an example of the network graph. In this example, based on the options that the user has chosen, the graph depicts deployments and traffic flows between them. It also uses a red badge to indicate deployments that are missing policies and therefore allowing all network traffic.

image::network-graph-20-overview.png[Overview of the Network graph showing deployments and connections]

The *Display options* drop-down list lets you control the items and level of detail displayed on the graph, as shown in the following example.

image::network-graph-20-display-options.png[Network graph display options]

When you click an item in the graph, the rearranged side panel with collapsible sections presents deployment and namespace information. The side panel switches between Deployment mode and Namespace mode based on item in the graph that you have selected. The D or NS label next to the item name in the header (in this example, "postgres,") indicates if it is a deployment or a namespace. The following example illustrates deployment mode.

image::network-graph-20-deployment-mode.png[Side panel for a deployment]

In Namespace mode, the side panel includes a search bar and a list of deployments. You can click on a deployment to view its information. In Namespace mode, the side panel also includes a new *Network policies* tab. From this tab, you can view, copy to the clipboard, or export any network policy defined in that namespace, as shown in the following example.

image::network-graph-20-namespace-mode.png[Side panel for a namespace showing network policy information]

[id="known-limitations-network-graph"]
==== Known limitations with network graph 2.0

The *Network graph 2.0 preview* menu item is available in the {product-title-short} portal with the existing *Network graph (1.0)* menu item to make it easier for you to try it and provide us with feedback. The network graph 2.0 has the following known limitations:

- When you filter the graph, the result contains your filtered deployments and other derived deployments and namespaces they interact with. A way to visualize and control the additional (derived) deployments is needed.
- The simulate network policy feature is limited. Specifically, the graphic view does not reflect the simulation, whether it was generated from the *Simulate network policy* panel or as a result of uploading a YAML file.
- An option to toggle the view of orchestration components is missing.
- You cannot clear the new *Namespaces* or *Deployments* selection filter. You must deselect each entry to clear it.
- The *Active traffic/Extraneous flows* drop-down list stays up and responds to clicks. Clicking *Active traffic* at that point results in switching to *Extraneous flows* mode.

[id="global-search-updates-374"]
=== Updated global search in the {product-title-short} portal

Global search has been redesigned and is now presented in a search page to help you quickly find information by using an extensive list of search criteria. Global search includes the following changes:

* Total search results are enumerated across more than 10 search categories, allowing you to zoom in on an area of interest.
* Individual search results are presented as line items, offering search category-sensitive direct links to view the result in the appropriate {product-title-short} product page or to further view the results as a filter on the Violations or Risk pages.
* Search now uses URLs, allowing you to navigate by using the browser, open search results in new tabs, and share search links.

[id="syslog-integration-374"]
=== Extra fields for improved syslog integration

When integrating with a syslog receiver, {product-title-short} automatically sends all violations and audit events to the configured syslog receiver. With {product-title-short} 3.74, you can now specify custom key-value pairs to send to the external system. The new extra fields allow you to customize the data that you can filter in your syslog receiver.

For more information, see xref:../integration/integrate-using-syslog-protocol.adoc#integrate-using-syslog-protocol[Integrating by using the syslog protocol].

[id="troubleshooting-collector-374"]
=== Troubleshooting guide enhanced when the Collector kernel module is missing

The Collector troubleshooting guide has been updated with practical tips to help you navigate the most common startup errors and understand how to fix them. In addition, the {product-title-short} portal health status dashboard has also been enhanced to redirect you to troubleshooting documents when the Collector status is unhealthy.

[id="scale-performance-improvements-374"]
=== Scale and performance improvements

Continuing our ongoing investment in scale and performance, {product-title-short} 3.74 includes these improvements to the Policy Violation widget in the Dashboard:

* Memory consumption in Central reduced by a factor of 10
* Typical widget load time in the {product-title-short} portal is less than 2 seconds even with a very large number of violations; for example, more than 100,000

[id="postgresql-technology-preview-374"]
== Features available if the PostgreSQL database option is installed

The features described in the following sections are available only if the PostgreSQL database option is installed.

:FeatureName: PostgreSQL database
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

[id="collections-374"]
=== {product-title-short} collections

{product-title-short} introduces a new concept called “collections” that provides the ability to define a collection of deployments by using matching patterns, and name this collection for repeatable use. A collection in {product-title-short} is a user-defined, named reference. It defines a logical grouping by using selection rules, offering you a power of expression as follows:

* Rules can match by using the name or the label of a deployment, namespace, or cluster.
* You can specify rules by using exact matches or regular expressions.
* Collections are resolved at run time. The rules can refer to objects that do not exist at the time of definition.
* Collections can be constructed by using other collections to describe complex hierarchies.

Collections provide you with a language to describe how your dynamic infrastructure is organized, eliminating the need for cloning and repetitive editing of {product-title-short} properties such as inclusion and exclusion scopes.

You can use collections to identify any group of deployments in your system, such as:

* An infrastructure area that is owned by a specific development team
* An application which requires different policy exceptions when running in a development or in a production cluster
* A distributed application that spans multiple namespaces, defined through a common deployment label
* The entire production or test environment using nested collections, cluster names, or labels

[NOTE]
====
In this Technology Preview release, collections are included only in the Vulnerability Reporting workflow, and existing report scopes are automatically migrated to collections. You must verify that the migration resulted in the correct configuration for your existing reports. See the “Migration of report scopes to collections” section for more information about the migration process.

In upcoming releases, it is anticipated that collections will be made available in other workflows in the product, starting with simplified policy management. Over time, it is planned that collections will be available in the dashboards, the network graph, and everywhere a {product-title-short} search or filter is used, allowing you to easily focus on an area of interest.
====

[id="policy-categories-374"]
=== Policy categories
Policy categories help you manage violations that are related to a similar cause by grouping and filtering violations according to policy category. Before {product-title-short} version 3.74, you could create policy categories inline within a policy. In version 3.74, policy categories receive higher visibility and greater importance in {product-title-short} systems using the PostgreSQL database option.

The {product-title-short} portal introduces a new *Policy Categories* tab in *Policy Management*. This tab provides the ability to view, create, rename, or delete categories. Before deleting a category, {product-title-short} determines if a category is used by any policy. System-defined policy categories are protected and you cannot modify or delete them.

The same actions for policy categories that are available in the {product-title-short} portal are also available through the API by using the `PolicyCategoryService` service. For more information, see the API documentation by navigating to *Help* -> *API reference* in the {product-title-short} portal.

[id="deprecation-notices-374"]

[id="deprecated-features-374"]
=== Deprecated features

The following sections describe the new permissions and indicate the deprecated permissions that will be removed in a future release.

[id="removed-attribute-374"]
==== Removed attribute

The product `BuildDate` attribute is deprecated and is planned to be removed in the next major version, {product-title-short} 4.0. The `/debug/versions.json` endpoint and `roxctl version --json` command will no longer return this attribute.

[id="action-builddate"]
===== Actions you must take

No action is required.

[id="permissions-changes-374"]
==== Future permissions changes

To continue to simplify access control management, {product-title-short} will group some permissions in permission sets. As a result, the following changes are planned for an upcoming release:

* The permission `WorkflowAdministration` will deprecate the permissions `Policy` and `VulnerabilityReports`.
* The permission `Access` will deprecate the permissions `Role`.
* The default role `Scope Manager` will be removed.
* The permission `WorkflowAdministration` are planned to replace `Policy` and `VulnerabilityReports` in permission sets in the {product-title-short} version 4.1 release. During the migration of the permission sets, the `WorfklowAdministration` permission will have the lowest access permission granted for either `Policy` or `VulnerabilityReports`. For example, a permission set with WRITE Policy and READ `VulnerabilityReports` access will have READ `WorkflowAdministration` access after the migration that is planned to occur with the {product-title-short} version 4.1 release. These changes in access can lead to unwanted side effects and missing access rights if you do not update your permission sets before the release.

[id="change-policy-vulnreports"]
===== New WorkflowAdministration role

The permission `WorkflowAdministration` will deprecate the permissions `Policy` and `VulnerabilityReports`.

[id="action-permissions-policy-vulnmgt"]
===== Actions you must take

Preemptively replace the `Policy` and `VulnerabilityReports` resources within your permission sets in favor of `WorkflowAdministration`.

[id="change-permissions"]
===== Change to Access role

The permission `Access` is planned to replace `Role` in permission sets in the {product-title-short} version 4.1 release. During the migration of the permission sets, the `Access` permission will have the lowest access permission granted for either `Access` or `Role`. For example, a permission set with READ Access and WRITE Role will have READ access after the migration. These changes in access can lead to unwanted side effects and missing access rights if you do not update your permission sets before the release.

[id="action-permissions-access"]
===== Actions you must take

Preemptively replace the `Role` resource within your permission sets with `Access`.

[id="change-scopemgr"]
===== Change to ScopeManager role

The default `ScopeManager` role is planned for removal in the {product-title-short} version 4.1 release. During the migration, authentication provider rules referencing that role will be updated to use the `None` role.

[id="action-permissions-role-scmgr"]
===== Actions you must take

If authentication provider rules reference the `ScopeManager` role for other purposes than Vulnerability Report management, you should manually create a similar role and replace references to `ScopeManager` with the new role in the authentication provider rules.

[id="kernel-collection-module"]
== Remove kernel module as collection method

*Added 20 March 2023*

Currently, secured clusters can specify three options of collection methods for runtime events: eBPF (selected by default), kernel module, or no collection. Kernel module as a collection method is deprecated in the {product-title-short} version 3.74 release and is planned for removal in the {product-title-short} version 4.1 release.

=== Actions you must take
Verify the collection method of your secured clusters. This value is set in the `collector.collectionMethod` parameter and is one of the following methods:

- `EBPF`
- `KERNEL_MODULE`
- `NO_COLLECTION`

If any of your secured clusters uses `KERNEL_MODULE` as a collection method, change it to `EBPF`.

[id="in-product-docs-removal"]
=== In-product docs removal

With this release, Red Hat removed the in-product docs accessible from the help menu.
If you are using the in-product docs, you can instead download the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_security_for_kubernetes/[Product Documentation for Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes] in PDF format. (ROX-12839)

[id="notice-support-upcoming-changes-374"]
== Notice of upcoming support changes

{product-title-short} version 3.74 is the last release that supports {ocp} versions 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, and 4.9. The next major version, {product-title-short} 4.0, will not support these {ocp} versions or earlier releases. See the link:https://access.redhat.com/node/5822721[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes Support Policy] for more information.

[id="bug-fixes-374"]
== Bug fixes

[id="resolved-in-version-3740"]
=== Resolved in version 3.74.0

Release date: 27 February 2023

* The {product-title-short} Operator previously incorrectly removed owner references from the `stackrox-db` persistent volume claim (PVC). This can cause an error such as `Failed reconciling PVC "stackrox-db". Please remove the storageClassName and size properties from your spec [...]`. The bug is fixed. However, if you receive this message, you need to perform the steps described in the link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6995414[Knowledgebase article]. (ROX-14335)
* The `v1/alerts/summary/counts` endpoint, which is used by the *Policy violations by severity* and *Policy violations by category* widgets on the Dashboard, was fixed to prevent Central from crashing in highly-scaled environments. (ROX-13829)
* {product-title-short} previously was not able to correctly identify the signature of images that contained the same content but were stored in different registries, causing problems with alerts and enforcement. This issue has been fixed and {product-title-short} now correctly identifies signatures of images from different registries. (ROX-12400)

[id="resolved-in-version-3741"]
=== Resolved in version 3.74.1

Release date: 20 March 2023

* Previously, Sensor that was installed on secured clusters could not connect to Central when using a proxy, even if the proxy was specified in the proxy configuration file or in environment variables. This issue is fixed and Sensor on secured clusters now connects to Central when using a proxy. (ROX-15279)

[id="resolved-in-version-3742"]
=== Resolved in version 3.74.2

Release date: 13 April 2023

* This release of {product-title-short} includes a fix for link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:1405[RHSA-2023:1405] OpenSSL security update for {op-system-base-full} 8.
* This release fixes a crash that occurs during migration to the PostgreSQL database (Technology Preview) when there are clusters that have not checked in recently.

[id="resolved-in-version-3743"]
=== Resolved in version 3.74.3

Release date: 2 May 2023

* This release of {product-title-short} includes a fix for link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-28617[CVE-2023-28617] for {op-system-base}.
* This release includes a fix for an issue with migration to the PostgreSQL database (Technology Preview).

[id="known-issues-374"]
=== Known issues

* Currently, {product-title-short} does not support alerts for security policy violations for containers running with default `seccomp profiles-Unconfined`. The alert violations for Unconfined `seccomp` profiles are generated only if the `seccomp` profile is explicitly set to "Unconfined" in the container specification. There is no workaround. (ROX-13490)
* In the {product-title-short} portal, the *Platform Configuration* -> *Clusters* page does not display information in the *Cloud Provider* field for Azure Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) clusters. There is no workaround. (ROX-14399)
