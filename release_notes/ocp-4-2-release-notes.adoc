frameworks, such as Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and PHP.

Built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Kubernetes, {product-title}
provides a more secure and scalable multi-tenant operating system for todayâ€™s
enterprise-class applications, while delivering integrated application runtimes
and libraries. {product-title} enables organizations to meet security, privacy,
compliance, and governance requirements.

[id="ocp-4-2-about-this-release"]
== About this release

Red Hat {product-title}
(link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2019:2921[RHBA-2019:2921]) is now
available. This release uses Kubernetes 1.14 with CRI-O runtime. New features,
changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} {product-version} are
included in this topic.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at
https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift. The {cloud-redhat-com}
application for {product-title} allows you to deploy OpenShift clusters to
either on-premise or cloud environments.

{product-title} {product-version} is supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 and
later, as well as Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS 4.2.

You must use {op-system-first} for the control plane, or master, machines and
can use either {op-system} or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 for compute, or worker,
machines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because only Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 7.6 is supported for compute
machines, you must not upgrade the Red Hat Enterprise Linux compute machines to
version 8.

[id="ocp-4-2-new-features-and-enhancements"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

[id="ocp-4-2-installation-and-upgrade"]
=== Installation and upgrade

[id="ocp-4-2-phased-rollout"]
==== {product-title} upgrades phased rollout

In {product-title} 4.1, Red Hat introduced the concept of upgrade channels for
recommending the appropriate upgrade versions to your cluster. Upgrade channels
separate upgrade strategies and also are used to control the cadence of updates.
Channels are tied to a minor version of {product-title}. For instance,
{product-title} {product-version} channels will never include an upgrade to a
4.3 release. This ensures administrators make an explicit decision to upgrade to
the next minor version of {product-title}. Channels only control updates and
have no impact on the version of the cluster you install; the
`openshift-install` binary for a given patch level of  {product-title} always
installs that patch level.

See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4495171[OpenShift 4.2 Upgrades
phased roll out] for more information on the types of updates and upgrade
channels.

Because upgrades are published to the channels as they are gradually rolled out to customers based on data from the Red Hat Service Reliability Engineering (SRE) team, you might not immediately see notification in the web console that updates from version 4.1.z to 4.2 are available at initial release.

[id="ocp-4-2-openshift-install"]
==== CLI-based installation

{product-title} {product-version} introduces a new CLI-based installer called
`openshift-install`. It is designed to simplify provisioning OpenShift on
immutable installer provisioned infrastructure using an interactive guided
workflow within about 30 minutes. This approach provides an OpenShift deployment
with full stack automation of host OS and platform updates and infrastructure
management without the complexity of having to provision your own
infrastructure. Only minimal user input is needed with all non-essential
installation configuration options, which are now configured post-installation
via component operator Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).

Updates are performed largely the same way. OpenShift update content must be
mirrored to the local container registry first; then the administrator
tells `oc adm upgrade` where to pull the update content from.

[id="ocp-4-2-installations-in-restricted-networks"]
==== Installations in restricted networks

{product-title} {product-version} introduces support for installation and
updating {product-title} clusters in restricted network environments. It is
designed to work with any `docker` 2.2 spec-compliant container registry for
hosting {product-title} content.

Administrators first must replicate content from Quay.io to their local
container registry. After that is done, `openshift-install` can be configured to
generate Ignition configs that pull content locally rather than from Quay.io.
This is designed to work with user-provisioned infrastructure (UPI) deployments
only.

You can still use Operators from the OLM catalog in restricted networks.
However, you must manually pull the Operator sources in order to populate the
the offline catalog. This manual process is only a temporary workaround for
{product-title} {product-version}. An automated solution will be provided in a
future release.

See
xref:../installing/install_config/installing-restricted-networks-preparations.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-preparations[Installing in restricted networks]
and xref:../operators/olm-restricted-networks.adoc#olm-restricted-networks[Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks]
for details.

[id="ocp-4-2-three-node-bare-metal-deployments"]
==== Three-node bare metal deployments (Technology Preview)
In {product-title} {product-version}, the ability to deploy a cluster without distinct compute, or worker nodes, on bare metal clusters is a Technology Preview feature. If you do not create worker machines when you install your cluster on bare metal infrastructure that you provision, all Pods, including the router Pods, are deployed on the control plane, or master, machines instead. Note that this deployment method is not available in cloud-based clusters in {product-title} {product-version}. It is not recommended to use technology preview features in production clusters.

[id="ocp-4-2-cluster-wide-egresss-proxy"]
==== Cluster-wide egress proxy

{product-title} {product-version} introduces support for installing and updating
an {product-title} cluster through a corporate proxy server on user-provisioned infrastructure. Proxy information
(httpProxy, httpsProxy, and noProxy) can be defined in the `install-config.yaml` file, which
is used during the installation process and can also be managed
post-installation via the `cluster` Proxy object.

IMPORTANT: The cluster-wide proxy is only supported if you used a user-provisioned infrastructure installation for a supported provider.

Also, there is now support for providing your own CA bundles allowing the
corporate proxy to MITM HTTPS.

[id="ocp-4-2-new-platform-boundary"]
==== New platform boundary

{product-title} is now aware of the entire infrastructure and brings the
operating system under management. This makes installation and updates seamless
across the platform and the underlying operating system. Everything is managed
as a single entity.

[id="ocp-4-2-IPI-UPI"]
==== IPI and UPI

In {product-title} {product-version}, there are two primary installation
experiences: Full stack automation (IPI) and pre-existing infrastructure (UPI).

With full stack automation, the installer controls all areas of the installation
including infrastructure provisioning with an opinionated best practices
deployment of {product-title}. With pre-existing infrastructure deployments,
administrators are responsible for creating and managing their own
infrastructure allowing greater customization and operational flexibility.

[id="ocp-4-2-full-stack-automated-deployments"]
==== Full stack automated deployments

In {product-title} {product-version}, there is expanded support for full stack
automated deployments to include AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP),
and Red Hat OpenStack Platform, as well as adding GCP to the existing list of
user provisioned infrastructure supported providers that already includes AWS,
Bare Metal, and VMware vSphere.

[id="ocp-4-2-CAM-CPMA"]
==== Red Hat Cluster Application Migration Tool and Red Hat Control Plane Migration Assistant

See link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4466651[Where can I find Red Hat
Cluster Application Migration Tool (CAM) and Red Hat Control Plane Migration
Assistant (CPMA) now that OpenShift 4.2 has GA'ed] for information on CAM and
CPMA.

[id="ocp-4-2-operators"]
=== Operators

[id="ocp-4-2-operator-documentation-moved"]
==== New location for Operator product documentation

The {product-title} product documentation related to Operators that was
previously found in the *Applications* guide is now located in the new
*Operators* guide. This includes existing and updated information on Operators,
the Operator Lifecycle Manager, and the Operator SDK, as well new content
specific to {product-title} 4.2.

[id="ocp-4-2-scoped-operator-installations"]
==== Scoped Operator installations

Previously, only users carrying `cluster-admin` roles  were allowed to install
Operators. In {product-title} {product-version}, the `cluster-admin` can select
namespaces in which namespace administrators can install Operators
self-sufficiently. The `cluster-admin` defines the ServiceAccount in this
namespace; all installed Operators in this namespace get equal or lower
permissions of this ServiceAccount.

See
xref:../operators/olm-creating-policy.adoc#olm-creating-policy[Creating policy for Operator installations and upgrades]
for details.

[id="ocp-4-2-ingress-operator"]
==== Ingress Operator
The Ingress Operator supports all ingress features on {product-version} with
installer-provisioned infrastructure on Azure and GCP.

[id="ocp-4-2-machine-config-operator"]
==== Machine Config Operator

The Machine Config Operator (MCO) provides cluster-level configuration, enables
rolling upgrades, and prevents drift between new and existing nodes.

[id="ocp-4-2-node-feature-discovery-operator"]
==== Node Feature Discovery Operator

The Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Operator detects hardware features available
on each node and advertises those features using node labels.

CPU features managed by NFD include:

* cpuid
* hardware_multithreading
* power
* pstate

Kernel features managed by NFD include:

* config
* selinux_enabled
* version
* os_version

Other features managed by NFD include:

* NVMe
* NUMA
* SR-IOV
* GPUs

The NFD Operator manages the installation and lifecycle of the NFD DaemonSet.
Access the NFD Operator in OperatorHub.

[id="ocp-4-2-node-tuning-operator-enhancements"]
==== Node Tuning Operator enhancements

The Node Tuning Operator was first introduced in {product-title} 4.1 and
manages cluster node-level tuning; The default CR is meant for delivering
standard node-level tuning. The enhancements in {product-title}
{product-version} allow for customizing the tunings for things such as high
performance.

For custom tuning, create your own tuned custom resources (CRs). Newly created
CRs will be combined with the default CR and custom tuning applied to nodes
based on node or Pod labels and profile priorities.

[id="ocp-4-2-storage"]
=== Storage

[id="ocp-4-2-persistent-volumes-LSO"]
==== Persistent volumes using the Local Storage Operator

Persistent volumes using the Local Storage Operator is now available in
{product-title} {product-version}.

[id="ocp-4-2-CSI"]
==== OpenShift Container Storage Interface (CSI)

Container Storage Interface (CSI) is now available in {product-title}
{product-version}. CSI is introduced in Kubernetes to enable Red Hat OpenShift
Container Storage (OCS) and partners with their CSI plug-ins. With the adoption
of the CSI, the Kubernetes volume layer becomes truly
link:https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/04/10/container-storage-interface-beta/[extensible].

For now, only the API is available. CSI drivers contained in operators will be
available in future releases.

[id="ocp-4-2-storage-devices"]
==== Raw block volume support

The following raw block volumes are now fully supported with {product-title} {product-version}:

* Local volumes
* Cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, and vSphere)

Raw block volumes using iSCSI are now in xref:ocp-4-2-technology-preview[Technology Preview].

[id="ocp-4-2-scale"]
=== Scale

[id="ocp-4-2-scale-cluster-limits"]
==== Cluster limits

Updated guidance around
xref:../scalability_and_performance/planning-your-environment-according-to-object-maximums.adoc#planning-your-environment-according-to-object-maximums[Cluster
Limits] for {product-title} {product-version} is now available.

Use the link:https://access.redhat.com/labs/ocplimitscalculator/[{product-title}
Limit Calculator] to estimate cluster limits for your environment.

[id="ocp-4-2-developer-experience"]
=== Developer experience

[id="ocp-4-2-ODO"]
==== OpenShift Do

OpenShift Do (odo) is a CLI tool for developers to create, build, and deploy
applications on OpenShift. The odo tool is completely client-based and requires no server
within the {product-title} cluster for deployment. It detects changes to local
code and deploys it to the cluster automatically, giving instant feedback to
validate changes in real time. It supports multiple programming languages and frameworks.

[id="ocp-4-2-CRC"]
==== CodeReady Containers

CodeReady Containers provides a local desktop instance of a minimal {product-title} 4 or newer cluster. This cluster provides developers with a minimal environment for development and testing purposes. It includes the `crc` CLI to interact with the CodeReady Containers virtual machine running the OpenShift cluster.

[id="ocp-4-2-nodes"]
=== Nodes

[id="ocp-4-2-crio-support"]
==== CRI-O support

CRI-O is a kubernetes-specific container engine that tracks and versions
identical to Kubernetes, simplifying support permutations. Adoption is trivial
because all existing Docker and OCI containers are supported and run well with
CRI-O.  CRI-O is a light weight, kubernetes-native, OCI-compatible container
runtime that is life-cycled and managed by {product-title}. You do not need to
worry about which container runtime is in use. With {product-title}, it is
always the right one and it provide a complete implementation of the Kubernetes
Container Runtime Interface (CRI). Also, you do not need to separately manage
the container engine. CRI-O has some tuneables that provide control and security
for CRI-O; they are easily configured in a CRD, and the settings are propagated
across the cluster.

[id="ocp-4-2-whitelisting-of-sysctls"]
==== Whitelisting of sysctls configuration

System administrators can whitelist sysctl on a per-node basis. All safe sysctls
are enabled by default; all unsafe sysctls are disabled by default. See
xref:../nodes/containers/nodes-containers-sysctls.adoc#nodes-containers-sysctls[Using
sysctls in containers] for more information.

[id="ocp-4-2-master-nodes-schedulable"]
==== Master nodes are now schedulable

In {product-title} {product-version}, master nodes are schedulable. See
xref:../nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-working.adoc[Working with nodes] for more
information.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Although you can schedule Pods to master nodes, the ability to remove all of the worker nodes from a cluster is limited to bare metal. See xref:ocp-4-2-three-node-bare-metal-deployments[Three-node bare metal deployments (Technology Preview)].
====

[id="ocp-4-2-networking"]
=== Networking

==== Installer-provisioned OpenShift on OpenStack

{product-title} {product-version} introduces full-stack automation support for
deploying {product-title} clusters on Red Hat OpenStack.

The installer uses the OpenStack APIs in conjunction with the Kubernetes
OpenStack Cloud Provider to create all the required OpenStack resources, such as
virtual machines (VMs), networks, security groups, and object storage needed to
deploy {product-title} and properly configure the cluster to run on the Red Hat
OpenStack Platform.

{product-title} {product-version} can be deployed on Red Hat OpenStack version
13.

[id="ocp-4-2-OVN"]
==== OVN (Technology Preview)

Open Virtual Networking (OVN) for Open vSwitch, currently in
xref:ocp-4-2-technology-preview[Technology Preview], has many advantages,
including acceleration of customer-driven feature requirements, some of which
are pre-enabled, including:

* Low barrier to integration; an implementation of virtual networking via OVS.
* SDN portfolio consolidation.
* Virtually eliminate iptables scale issues.
* Heterogeneous clusters with Windows nodes.
* The capability to span on-premise and cloud nodes
* Full Network Policy support.
* Egress IP per Pod.
* Distributed L4 Ingress/Egress firewall.
* Distributed services load balancer.
* Traffic isolation and multi-tenancy.
* Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) support.
* Encrypted tunnels.
* IPv6 and DHCPv6.
* QoS, control and data plane separation.

[id="ocp-4-2-enable-ingress-controllers"]
==== Enable internal Ingress Controllers for private clusters

When creating an Ingress Controller on cloud platforms, the Ingress Controller is
published by a public cloud load balancer by default.

Users can now publish Ingress Controllers with internal cloud load balancers. For
example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
  name: internal
spec:
  endpointPublishingStrategy:
    type: LoadBalancerService
    loadBalancer:
      scope: Internal
----

See the
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/#internal-load-balancer.[Kubernetes
Services documentation] for implementation details.

Once set, `.spec.endpointPublishingStrategy.loadBalancer.scope` cannot
be changed. To change the scope, delete and recreate the Ingress Controller.

The `default` Ingress Controller can be made internal by deleting and recreating
it.

See xref:../networking/ingress-operator.adoc#configuring-ingress[Ingress
Operator in {product-title}] for more information.

[id="ocp-4-2-kubernetes-cni-plug-in-additions"]
==== Kubernetes CNI plug-in additions and enhancements

Several Kubernetes CNI plug-ins are added or enhanced in {product-title}
{product-version} to grow capability.

These SR-IOV solutions remain in Technology Preview in {product-title}
{product-version}:

* RDMA and RoCE Support
* DPDK Mode for SR-IOV VFs
* Admission Controller
* Operator

New CNI plug-ins:

* IPVLAN
* Bridge with VLAN
* Static IPAM

[id="ocp-4-2-enablement-of-GPUs"]
==== Enablement of GPUs in an OpenShift cluster

GPUs are now supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 nodes. They are not
supported on RHEL CoreOS nodes because of lack of support for CUDA driver and
driver containers.

[id="ocp-4-2-web-console"]
=== Web console

[id="ocp-4-2-custom-branding"]
==== Console customization options

You can customize the {product-title} web console to set a custom logo, links,
notification banners, and command line downloads. This is especially helpful if you
need to tailor the web console to meet specific corporate or government
requirements.

See
xref:../web_console/customizing-the-web-console.adoc#customizing-web-console[Customizing
the web console] for more information.

[id="ocp-4-2-new-api-explorer"]
==== New API Explorer

You can now easily search and manage API resources in the *Explore API
Resources* dashboard located at *Home* -> *Explore*.

View the schema for each API and what parameters being supported, manage the
instances of the API, and review the access of each API.

[id="ocp-4-2-machine-autoscaler"]
==== Machine Autoscaler

You can now scale your cluster with the Machine Autoscaler. The Machine
Autoscaler adjusts the number of Machines in the MachineSets being deployed in
your cluster. Increase Machines when the cluster runs out of resources to
support more deployments.  Any changes, such as the minimum or maximum number of
instances, are immediately applied to the MachineSet that MachineAutoscalers
target.

[id="ocp-4-2-developer-perspective"]
==== Developer Perspective

The Developer perspective adds a developer-focused perspective to the web
console. It provides workflows specific to developer use cases, such as creation
and deployment of applications to {product-title} using multiple options. It
provides a visual representation of the applications within a project, their
build status, and the components and services associated with them,  enabling
easy interaction and monitoring. It incorporates Serverless capabilities
(Technology Preview) and the ability to create workspaces to edit your
application code using Eclipse Che.

[id="ocp-4-2-prometheus-queries"]
==== Prometheus queries

You can now run Prometheus queries directly in the web console. Navigate to
*Monitoring* -> *Metrics*.

[id="ocp-4-2-web-console-idps"]
==== Identity providers

On the cluster OAuth configuration page, more identity providers (IDPs) are
provided for the user to log in to the cluster. The IDPs include GitHub, GitLab,
Google, LDAP, Keystone, and so on.

[id="ocp-4-2-general-web-console-updates"]
==== General web console updates

* The dashboard is redesigned with more metrics.
* *Catalog* is moved to the *Developer* perspective: *Developer* -> *Add+* -> *From
Catalog*.
* Status of projects is now moved to the *Workloads* tab on the project details page.
* OperatorHub is now located under the *Operators* menu.
* There is now support for chargeback. You can break down the reserved and used
resources requested by applications.
* There is now support for native templates without needing to enable the Service
Catalog, which is now deprecated.

[id="ocp-4-2-notable-technical-changes"]
== Notable technical changes

{product-title} {product-version} introduces the following notable technical
changes.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-2-corsAllowedOrigins"]
==== corsAllowedOrigins

`corsAllowedOrigins` can now be configured. See
xref:../authentication/allowing-javascript-access-api-server.adoc[Allowing
JavaScript-based access to the API server from additional hosts] for more
information.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-2-new-cni-plugins"]
==== New CNI plug-ins

There are two new CNI plug-ins for Multus: bridge and ipvlan.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-2-cno-supports-SimpleMacvlan"]
==== Cluster Network Operator supports SimpleMacvlan

Cluster Network Operator (CNO) now supports configuring SimpleMacvlan.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-2-layers"]
==== Builds maintain their layers

In {product-title} {product-version}, builds keep their layers by default.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-2-windows-builds-not-supported"]
==== Builds on Windows

Builds are not scheduled on Windows nodes.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-2-ingress-controller-support-disabled"]
==== Ingress controller support disabled

Ingress controller TLS 1.0 and 1.1 support is now disabled to match the
Mozilla intermediate security profile.

New and upgraded ingress controllers will no longer support these TLS versions.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-2-remove-csc-usage"]
==== Reduce OperatorHub complexity by removing CatalogSourceConfig usage

OperatorHub has been updated to reduce the
number of API resources a cluster administrator must interact with and
streamline the installation of new Operators on {product-title} {product-version}.

To work with OperatorHub in {product-title} 4.1, cluster administrators
primarily interacted with OperatorSource and CatalogSourceConfig API resources.
OperatorSources are used to add external datastores where Operator bundles are
stored.

CatalogSourceConfigs were used to enable an Operator present in the
OperatorSource of your cluster. Behind the scenes, it configured an Operator
Lifecycle Manager (OLM) CatalogSource so that the Operator could then be managed
by OLM.

To reduce complexity, OperatorHub in {product-title} {product-version} no longer
uses CatalogSourceConfigs in the workflow of installing Operators. Instead,
CatalogSources are still created as a result of adding OperatorSources to the
cluster, however Subscription resources are now created directly using the
CatalogSource.

[NOTE]
====
While OperatorHub no longer uses CatalogSourceConfig resources, they are still
supported in {product-title}.
====

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-2-global-catalog-namespace"]
==== Global catalog namespace change

In {product-title} 4.1, the default global catalog namespace, where
CatalogSources are installed by default, is
`openshift-operator-lifecycle-manager`. Starting with {product-title}
{product-version}, this has changed to the `openshift-marketplace` namespace.

If you have installed an Operator from OperatorHub on an {product-title} 4.1
cluster, the CatalogSource is in the same namespace as the Subscription. These
Subscriptions are not affected by this change and should continue to behave
normally after a cluster upgrade.

In {product-title} {product-version}, if you install an Operator from
OperatorHub, the Subscription created refers to a CatalogSource located in the
new global catalog namespace `openshift-marketplace`.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-2-global-catalog-namespace-workaround"]
===== Workaround for existing Subscriptions in the previous global catalog namespace

If you have existing CatalogSources in the old
`openshift-operator-lifecycle-manager` namespace, any existing Subscription
objects that are referring to the CatalogSource will fail to upgrade, and new
Subscription objects that are referring to the CatalogSource will fail to
install.

To workaround such upgrade failures:

.Procedure
. Move the CatalogSource object from the previous global catalog namespace to
the `openshift-marketplace` namespace.

==== Recycle reclaim policy

Recycle reclaim policy is now deprecated. Dynamic provisioning is recommended.

[id="ocp-4-2-bug-fixes"]
== Bug fixes

*Builds*

* Blocked registries were not set in `registries.conf` used by Buildah. Therefore,
Buildah could push an image to a registry blocked by the cluster image policy.
With this bug fix, the `registries.conf` file generated for builds now includes
blocked registries. Builds now respect the blocked registries setting for image
pull and push.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1730722[*BZ#1730722*])

* When shell variables were referenced in build configurations that used the
source-to-image build strategy, logic that attempted to produce a Dockerfile,
which could be used to perform the source-to-image build, would incorrectly
attempt to evaluate those variables. As a result, some shell variables would be
erroneously evaluated as empty values, leading to build errors, and other
variables would trigger error messages from failed attempts to evaluate them.
Shell variables referenced in build configurations are now properly escaped, so
that they are evaluated at the expected time. These errors should no longer be
observed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1712245[*BZ#1712245*])

* Due to a logic bug, attempts to push an image to a registry after it was built
would fail if the build's BuildConfig specified an output of type DockerImage,
but the name that was specified for that output image did not include a tag
component. The attempt to push a built image would fail. The builder now adds
the "latest" tag to a name if one is not specified. An image built using a
BuildConfig specifying an output of type DockerImage, with a name that does not
include a tag component, will now be pushed using the "latest" tag.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1746499[*BZ#1746499*])

*Cloud Credential Operator*

* Previously, there was a memory limit on the Pod. As a result, the Credential
Operator could crash on clusters with large numbers of projects/namespaces. With
this bug fix, the memory limit is removed, the Operator no longer crashes, and
memory is handled by the cluster itself.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1711402[*BZ#1711402*])

* The `cloud-credential` ClusterOperator did not define related resources, causing
Operator logs to not be present in tarballs generated by the `oc adm
must-gather` command. This bug fix updates the Operator to add related
resources, and as a result logs are now included.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1717631[*BZ#1717631*])

*Containers*

* `rshared` propogation might cause the `/sys` filesystem to recursively mount on
top of itself, causing container fails to start with "no space left on device"
errors. This bug fix prevents that there are recursive `/sys` mounts on top of
each other, and as a result containers run correctly with the `rshared: true`
option set.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1711200[*BZ#1711200*])

* When the Dockerfile builder handled `COPY` instructions that used the `--from`
flag to specify content be copied from an image rather than either builder
context or a previous stage, the image's name could be logged as though it had
been specified in a `FROM` instruction. The name would be listed multiple times
if multiple `COPY` instructions specified it as the argument to a `--from`
flag. This bug fix ensures the builder no longer attempts to trigger the pulling
of images that are referred to in this way at the start of the build process. As
a result, images that are referenced in `COPY` instructions using the `--from`
flag are no longer pulled until their contents are required, and the build log
no longer logs a `FROM` instruction that specifies the name of such an image.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1684427[*BZ#1684427*])

* Logic which handled `COPY` and `ADD` instructions in cases where the build
context directory included a `.dockerignore` file would not correctly handle
some symbolic links and subdirectories. An affected build would fail while
attempting to process a `COPY` or `ADD` instruction that triggered the bug. This
bug fix extends the logic which handles this case, and as a result these errors
should no longer occur.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1707941[*BZ#1707941*])

*Images*

* Long running jenkins agent or slave Pods can experience the defect process
phenomenon that has previously been observed with the jenkins master. Several
defect processes show up in process listings until the Pod is terminated. This
bug fix employs `dumb-init` with the OpenShift Jenkins master image to clean up
these defect processes, which occur during jenkins job processing. As a result,
process listings within agent or slave Pods, and on the hosts those Pods reside,
no longer include the defunct processes.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1705123[*BZ#1705123*])

* Changes to OAuth support in {product-version} allow for different certificate
configurations between the Jenkins service account certificate and the
certificate used by the router for the OAuth server. As a result, you could not
log into the Jenkins console. With this bug fix, the {product-title} Jenkins
login plug-in was updated to attempt TLS connections with the default
certificates available to the JVM in addition to the certificates mounted into
the Pod. You can now log into the jenkins console.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1709575[*BZ#1709575*])

* The {product-title} Jenkins Sync plug-in confused ImageStreams and ConfigMaps
with the same name when processing them for Jenkins Kubernetes plug-in
PodTemplates, causing an event for one type to be able to delete the Pod
template created from another type. With this bug fix, the {product-title}
Jenkins Sync plug-in was modified to keep track of which API object type created
the Pod template of a given name. Now, Jenkins Kubernetes plug-in PodTemplates
created by the {product-title} Sync plug-in's mapping from ConfigMaps and
ImageStreams are not inadvertently deleted when two types with the same name
exist in the cluster.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1711340[*BZ#1711340*])

* Quick, successive, deletes of the Samples Operator configuration object could
lead to the last delete hanging and the Operator stuck in it's
`ImageChangesInProgress` condition stuck in `True`, which resulted in the
`clusteroperator` object for the Samples Operator being stuck in
`Progressing==True`, causing indeterminate state for cluster samples. This bug
fix introduced corrections to the coordination between the delete finalizer and
Samples upsert. Quick, successive deletes of the Samples Operator configuration
object now work as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1735711[*BZ#1735711*])

* Previously, the pruner was getting all images in a single request, which caused
the request to take too long. This bug fix introduced the use of the pager to
get all of the images. Now the pruner can get all of the images without timing
out. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1702757[*BZ#1702757*])

* Previously the importer could only import up to three signatures, but
link:registry.redhat.io[registry.redhat.io] often has more than three
signatures. This caused signatures to not be imported. This bug fix increased
the limit of the importer so signatures can now be imported.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1722568[*BZ#1722568*])

*Image Registry*

* Previously the CRD did not have OpenAPI schema, which meant `oc explain` did not
work for the `config.imageregistry` resource. This bug fix enabled the
generation of the OpenAPI schema, so `oc explain` can now provide information
about the `config.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io` resource.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1705752[*BZ#1705752*])

* The Image Registry Operator did not register the
`openshift-image-registry` namespace as a related object. In some situations, no
data from the image registry or Image Registry Operator would be collected from
`must-gather`. This bug fix ensures the `openshift-image-registry` namespace is
always included in the Image Registry Operator's related objects. As a result,
basic information from the `openshift-image-registry` namespace including Pods,
deployments, and services is always collected by `must-gather`.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1748436[*BZ#1748436*])

* Previously the CVO, the Image Registry Operator, and the `service-ca` injection
controller simultaneously watched and updated the CA bundle used by the image
registry. This caused the CA bundle used to establish trust between the internal
registry and the rest of OpenShift to be constantly removed and recreated. With
this bug fix, the CVO no longer manages the CA bundle. The Image Registry
Operator ensures that the ConfigMap to hold the CA bundle is created, but does
not manage its content. Now the ConfigMap holding the CA bundle for the internal
registry is only updated as needed by the `service-ca` injection controller.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1734564[*BZ#1734564*])

* TLS keys were not added to registry routes. This is because TLS keys were stored
in `Secret.StringData` and the Operator was unable to see the real data in the
secret. Now, Secret.Data is used instead and the Operator can see the values.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1719965[*BZ#1719965*])

* The drain process would take up to 600 seconds to evict the image-registry Pod.
This was because the image registry was running from sh and signals were not
propagated to the image registry, and unable to receive SIGTERM. Now, the
registry process uses exec and the registry is the pid 1 process and able to
receive SIGTERM. Drain now evicts successfully.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1729979[*BZ#1729979*])

* `must-gather` did not collect PVCs and events in the `openshift-image-registry`
 namespace. Now, PVCs are collected as part of the `must-gather` process.
 (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1737558[*BZ#1737558*])

*Installer*

* Default minimal installations of Red Hat Enterprise Linux would install and
enable firewalld.service. The firewall service would block ports that prevented
`oc rsh/exec/logs` from working as expected. Now, `firewalld.service` is disabled
if it is installed to conform to testing standards.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1740439[*BZ#1740439*])

* Workers were not created when the default path for images was changed from the
 default settings. Now, the installer creates and uses it's own storage pool.
 (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1707479[*BZ#1707479*])

*kube-apiserver*

* It was possible to shorten certificate rotation by creating a ConfigMap. This
behavior is not supported. Now, if you create this ConfigMap, `Upgradable` is
set to `False` on the kubeapiserver-operator, which means that you can no longer
update your cluster.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1722550[*BZ#1722550*])

*Logging*

* The dynamic seeding function of Elasticsearch was inefficient, and clusters with
a large number of projects made too many calls. This issue was compounded by a
lack of caching. Because of the inefficient seeding and lack of caching, calls
to Elasticsearch were timing out before a response was returned. This bug fix
added API call caching and ACL seeding. These improvements reduce the
opportunity for page timeouts.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1705589[*BZ#1705589*])

* The Logging Operator relied on the type of information stream to set the log
type, so logs sent to `stdout` were tagged as `INFO` and logs sent to `stderr`
were tagged as `ERROR`. This method does not always correctly convey the
information type. Now, the log level is no longer set based on the information
stream. Instead, it is set to `unknown` if the correct log level cannot be
determined.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1726639[*BZ#1726639*])

* During Cluster Logging instance deletion, resources under Cluster Logging were
deleted independently. Therefore, there could be a short time period when the
Fluentd or Rsyslog DaemonSet was still running but its log collector service
account was removed. This made the logs processed in this time miss Kubernetes
information, including the namespace name. With this bug fix, the service
accounts now wait to be deleted until all descendant resources are deleted.
There is now no chance for the collector DaemonSets to run without the log
collector service account.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1715370[*BZ#1715370*])

*Web Console*

* Previously, console Operator logs for events would print some duplicate
messages. A version update for a dependency repository has resolved this issue
and messages are no longer being duplicated in console Operator logs.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1687666[*BZ#1687666*])

* Users were not able to copy the whole webhook URL since the secret value was
obfuscated. A link was added so that users are now able to copy the entire
webhook URL with the secret value included.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1665010[*BZ#1665010*])

* The Machine and Machine Set details pages in the web console did not contain an
*Events* tab. An *Events* tab is now added and is now available from the *Machine*
and *Machine Set* details pages.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1693180[*BZ#1693180*])

* Previously, users could not view a node's status from its details page in the
web console. A status field has been added and users can now view a node's
status from its details page.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1706868[*BZ#1706868*])

* Previously, you would occasionally see a blank popup in the web console if you
attempted to create an Operator resource immediately after installing an
Operator through the OperatorHub. With this bug fix, a clear message is now
shown if you attempt to create a resource before it is available.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1710079[*BZ#1710079*])

* Previously the Deployment Config Details page in the web console would say that
the status was *Active* before the first revision had rolled out. With this bug
fix, the status now says *Updating* before a rollout has occurred, and *Up to
date* when the rollout is complete.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1714897[*BZ#1714897*])

* Previously, the metrics charts for nodes in the web console could incorrectly
total usage for more than one node in some circumstances. With this bug fix, the
node page charts now correctly display the usage only for that node.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1720119[*BZ#1720119*])

* Previously, the ca.crt value for OpenID identity providers was not set properly
when created through the web console. The problem has been fixed, and the ca.crt
is now correctly set.
link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1727282[*BZ#1727282*])

* Previously, users would see an error in the web console when navigating to the
ClusterResourceQuota instances from the CRD list. The problem has been fixed,
and you can now successfully list ClusterResourceQuota instances from the CRD
page. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1742952[*BZ#1742952*])

* Previously, the web console did not show when a node was unscheduleable in the
node list. This was inconsistent with the CLI. The console now shows when a node
is unscheduleable from the node list and node details pages.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1748405[*BZ#1748405*])

* Previously, the web console would show config map and secret keys with all caps
styling in the resource details pages. This is a problem as key names are often
file names and case sensitive. The {product-title} {product-version} web console
now shows config map and secret keys in their proper case.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1752572[*BZ#1752572*])

*Networking*

* Egress IP addressess did not work correctly in namespaces with restrictive
NetworkPolicies. As a result, Pods that accepted traffic from specific sources
would not be able to send egress traffic through egress IPs, because the
response from the external server would be mistakenly rejected by their
NetworkPolicies. With this bug fix, replies from egress traffic are now
correctly recognized as replies rather than as new connections. Egress IPs and
NetworkPolicy work together.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1700431[*BZ#1700431*])

* If a Pod using an external IP address to contact an external host received an
external IP address not responding condition, the egress IP monitoring code
mistakenly determined that the host was not responding. As a result,
highly-available egress IPs could get switched to a different node to another.
The monitoring code was fixed to distinguish between a egress node not
responding and a final destination not responding conditions. Highly available
egress IPs are not be switched between nodes unnecessarily.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1717639[*BZ#1717639*])

* By default, the etcd namespace was created without specifying a net id. As a
result, API server components could not connect to etcd. The code was fixed to
specify `netid=1` for the etcd namespace.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1719653[*BZ#1719653*])

*Node*

* The algorithm used when merging additional IP addresses added to a node was
incorrect. As a result, when adding an additional IP address to a node, the list
of addresses was out of order, resulting in the node being unable to communicate
to the API server. The merge algorithm for addresses was changed to not reorder
the addresses. Adding secondary IP addresses to a node no longer changes the
ordering and the node is able to continue communication with the API server.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1696628[*BZ#1696628*])

* Because of a problem with the kubeConfig controller, changes to the kubelet
Config are reverted if the cluster is upgraded to a version that uses a
different OS release. The code was fixed to specify the correct controller in
the source. Customizations to the kubeletConfig will be retained.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1718726[*BZ#1718726*])

*oc*

* The wrong validation for node selector labels was causing empty values for keys
on labels to not be accepted. This update fixes the node selector label
validation mechanism so that an empty value for a key on label is a valid node
selector.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1683819[*BZ#*1683819*])

* The `oc get` command was not returning the proper information when it received
an empty result list. This update improves the information that is returned when
`oc get` receives an empty list.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1708280[*BZ#1708280*])

*OLM*

* Marketplace Cluster Operator was reporting `degraded` when restarting or
upgrading the Marketplace Operator. Therefore, the {product-title} upgrade tests
were failing. With this bug fix, the upgrade tests are passing again because
{product-title} is no longer reporting `degraded` when the Operator is stopped.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1706867[*BZ#1706867*])

* A bug during upgrade was causing Marketplace Operator to degrade and exit. The
ClusterOperator status did not give an accurate description of the health of the
Marketplace Operator.
+
The following issues were contributing to this:
+
** Multiple Marketplace Operators were running and updating the ClusterOperatorStatus at the same time.
** The sync would fail if an error occurred while reconciling an operand (OperatorSources or CatalogSourceConfigs). This allowed network issues or invalid operands to drive to a degraded state. The Marketplace Operator also degraded when failed syncs surpassed a threshold of total syncs.
** It was difficult to identify why a ClusterOperatorStatus condition was in a given state via telemetry. Marketplace did not set a reason, although telemetry includes the state and reason.
+
With this bug fix:
+
** Leader election provided by the Operator SDK prevents multiple Marketplace Operators from updating the ClusterOperatorStatus at the same time.
** Marketplace only reports a degraded state when it is unable to get or update its operands, rather than whenever an error is encountered while reconciling an operand.
** Marketplace now includes a reason when setting a condition so that telemetry provides better insights into the state of the Marketplace Operator.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1721537[*BZ#1721537*])

* The CatalogSourceConfig (`csc`) and OperatorSource (`opsrc`) Custom Resource
Definitions (CRDs) owned by Marketplace did not include a description.
Therefore, `oc explain csc` and `oc explain opsrc` would return empty
descriptions. With this bug fix, OpenAPI CRD definitions are now added so that
`oc explain csc` and `oc explain opsrc` now work.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1723835[*BZ#1723835*])

* The Marketplace Operator was overwriting the Pod deployment spec of registry
deployments associated with OperatorSources. Therefore, users were unable to add
NodeSelectors. With this bug fix, required fields are only replaced in the
deployment spec on OperatorSource updates, allowing users to add NodeSelectors
to the Operator registry Pod associated with OperatorSources. By default, no
NodeSelector is present. Users can now add NodeSelectors to the Pod spec in the
registry Pod deployments. For example, with the `community-operators`
OperatorSource, you would edit the `community-operators` deployment in the
`openshift-marketplace` namespace.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1696726[*BZ#1696726*])

* The Marketplace Operator was scaling the registry deployment down and then scaling
it back up to force updates. This could cause the Pod to crash-loop if there was
an issue in the registry Pod. This bug fix uses annotation to force the update,
rather than scaling the registry deployment up and down so that the deployment
will not become unavailable. Note that this alone will not fix the bug. A fix is
required to the end-to-end test that does not fail it on crash-looping Pods in
the 'openshift-marketplaceâ€™ namespace.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1700100[*BZ#1700100*])

* The must-gather tool requires a field, `RelatedObjects`, in the ClusterOperator
Custom Resource to be populated with ObjectReferences of the resources
associated with the Operator. Because this field was missing for Marketplace,
the must-gather tool was not able to gather enough information about the
Marketplace Operator. This update now populates the `RelatedObjects` field with
the Operatorâ€™s namespace and the
OperatorSource/CatalogSourceConfig/CatalogSource resources. This enables the
must-gather tool to gather enough information about the Marketplace Operator.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1717439[*BZ#1717439*])

*OpenShift Controller Manager*

* Setting the OpenShift Controller Manager Operator to `Unmanaged` or `Removed` is
unsupported, so it would cause the conditions on the corresponding
ClusterOperator object to go to an `Unknown` status. With this bug fix, the
OpenShift Controller Manager Operator now ignores the unsupported `Unmanagedâ€™
and `Removed` settings for management state. A message now explains this in the
ClusterOperator status conditions.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1719188[*BZ#1719188*])

*Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS)*

* Previously, SSH connections were hanging when the ClientAliveInterval within the
sshd configuration was not set to 180 as required by Microsoft Azure. This bug
fix now defaults the sshd config to 180 so that SSH no longer hangs within
Azure. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1701050[*BZ#1701050*])

*Service Broker*

* Previously, the Automation Broker always created a network policy to give a
transient namespace access to the target namespace. As a consequence, the target
namespace locked down to the newly created policy and namespaces could
communicate with each other. This fix causes the Automation Broker to check if
there are network policies in place for the target namespace, and if there are
none, to not create a new network policy. This fix allows the Automation Broker
to perform Ansible Playbook Bundle actions actions without affecting the
existing services running in the target namespace.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1643303[*BZ#1643303*])

* Previously, the OpenShift Ansible Service Broker Operator did not pass metrics to
Prometheus unless the correct permissions were manually applied. With this
update, the Operator now automatically installs with the required permissions.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1692281[*BZ#1692281*])

*Templates*

* Previously, the custom resource definition for the Samples Operator
configuration object (`configs.samples.operator.openshift.io`) did not have
openAPIV3Schema validation defined. Therefore,`oc explain` was unable to provide
useful information about the object. With this fix, openAPIV3Schema validation
was added, and now `oc explain` works on the object.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1705753[*BZ#1705753*])

* Previously, the Samples Operator was using a direct {product-title} go client to
make GET calls in order to maintain controller/informer based watches for
secrets, imagestreams, and templates. This resulted in unnecessary API calls
being made against the {product-title} API server. This fix leverages the
informer/listener API and reduces activity against the {product-title} API
server. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1707834[*BZ#1707834*])

* Previously, the Samples Operator was not creating a cluster role that aggregated
into the cluster-reader role. As a consequence, users with the cluster-reader
role could not read the config object for the samples Operator. With this
update, the manifest of the samples operator was updated to include a cluster
role for read-only access to its config object, and this role aggregated into
the cluster-reader role. Now, users with the cluster-reader role can read, list,
and watch the config object for the samples Operator.

== Known issues

* If you have Service Mesh installed, upgrade Service Mesh before upgrading
{product-title}. For a workaround, see
xref:../service_mesh/service_mesh_install/updating-ossm.adoc#updating-ossm[Updating OpenShift
Service Mesh from version 1.0.1 to 1.0.2].

* Cluster-scoped resources are not yet handled by the application migration tool,
including resources such as Cluster Role Bindings and Security Context
Constraints. If applications you are migrating depend on these kind of
cluster-scoped resources on the source cluster, manually ensure they are
recreated on the destination cluster. Coverage will be expanded in a future
release to handle these resources.

* 4.2.0 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) does not currently work with
any of the Multus CNI plug-ins.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1754686[*BZ#1754686*])

* Cluster Loader fails when called without configuration.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1761925[*BZ#1761925*])

* The Cluster Network Operator does not a remove `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` that
the Operator created previously, when the additional network is removed from the
`additionalNetworks` collection.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1755586[*BZ#1755586*])

* The Prometheus Operator deploys `StatefulSet` and creates a memory limit that is
too small on the `rules-configmap-reloader` container.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1735691[*BZ#1735691*])

* DHCP mode fails when configuring it in Multus CNI IPAM.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1754682[*BZ#1754682*])

* Schema change in `ClusterResourceQuota` from version 4.1 to 4.2 results in
breakage.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1755125[*BZ#1755125*])

* Disaster recovery is broken for various deployments, including bare metal and
vSphere. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1718436[*BZ#1718436*])

* Removing `simpleMacvlanConfig` from the Cluster Network Operator does not delete
the old `network-attachment-definition`. You must delete the resources manually.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1755586[*BZ#1755586*])

* The SRIVO Operator Pod crashes when NAD is manually created.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1755188[*BZ#1755188*])

* No proxy is set for `kube-controller-manager`.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1753467[*BZ#1753467*])

* `git clone` operations that go through an HTTPS proxy will fail. Non-TLS (HTTP)
proxies can be used successfully.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1750650[*BZ#1750650*])

* Builds that use image references that correlate to an image mirror, which is
the case in a disconnected environment, will fail to pull or push those image
references if the mirror requires authentication.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1745192[*BZ#1745192*])

* Image stream import does not use mirrors. This is often used in disconnected environments.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1741391[*BZ#1741391*])

* {product-title} {product-version} will not work on Red Hat OpenStack Platform 15
until this Red Hat OpenStack Platform 15 bug is resolved.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1751942[*BZ#1751942*])

* If builds use a build secret, it is strongly recommended that layers are squashed
using `imageOptimizationPolicy: SkipLayers`. Otherwise, secrets might leak in
`source` and `docker` strategy builds.

* AllowVolumeExpansion, and other StorageClass attributes, are not updated
when upgrading {product-title}.
It is recommended to delete the default StorageClass and allow the
ClusterStorageOperator to recreate this with the correct attributes after
the upgrade is completed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1751641[*BZ#1751641*])

* Non-serverless workloads show resources for serverless workloads in the *Topology* resources panel. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1760810[*BZ#1760810*])

* Pod status is depicted inconsistently in the *Topology* view, *Resources* side panel, and the *Deployment Config Details* page. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1760827[*BZ#1760827*])

* When an application is created using the *Add* page options, the deployed image ignores the selected target port and always uses the first entry. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1760836[*BZ#1760836*])

* Certain features like the name of the application and the build status are not rendered in the *Topology* view on the Edge browser. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1760858[*BZ#1760858*])

* Determination of active Pods when a rollout fails can be incorrect in the *Topology* view. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1760828[*BZ#1760828*])

* If a cluster-wide egress proxy is configured and then later unset, Pods for
applications that have been previously deployed by OLM-managed Operators can
enter a `CrashLoopBackOff` state. This is caused by the deployed Operator still
being configured to rely on the proxy.
+
[NOTE]
====
This issue applies for environment variables, Volumes, and VolumeMounts created
by the cluster-wide egress proxy. This same issue occurs when setting
environment variables, Volumes, and VolumeMounts using the SubscriptionsConfig
object.
====
+
A fix is planned for a future release of
{product-title}, however you can workaround the issue by deleting the Deployment
using the CLI or web console. This triggers OLM to regenerate the Deployment and
starts up Pods with the correct networking configuration.
+
Cluster administrators can get a list of all affected OLM-managed Deployments by
running the following command:
+
----
$ oc get deployments --all-namespaces \
    -l olm.owner,olm.owner!=packageserver <1>
----
<1> Exclude `packageserver`, which is unaffected.
+

[[ocp-4-2-16-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* The Kube Controller Manager (KCM) did not have permissions to recreate its
lease ConfigMap; therefore, when the lease ConfigMap was deleted, KCM was unable
to properly secure the lease ConfigMap. This bug fix updates the KCM permissions
created by the KCM Operator, allowing KCM to recover from lease ConfigMap
deletion. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1718061[*BZ#1718061*])

* The AWS Billing integration was broken during the 4.2 release cycle, not
allowing users to use it. This was caused by the following issues:
+
** Quoting of partition values/locations was incorrect.
** Incorrectly checking database name for AWS Billing data sources could cause
a panic.
** The AWS Billing data source was not an input in the `aws-ec2-billing-raw`
query, causing `table not found` errors when the data source was still
initializing due to the lack of input dependency.
** Managing partitions of Hive tables was not using the Hive database/schema
name when altering partitions. This prevented partitions from being managed.
** The Hive tables `spec.fileFormat` was being ignored, preventing the table
format from being correctly specified.
+
The correct adjustments have been made to the aforementioned structure and
`values.yaml` fields to fix AWS Billing integration. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1763305[*BZ#1763305*])
