== About this release

// TODO: Update with the relevant information closer to release.
{product-title} (link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-202X:XXXX[RHSA-202X:XXXXX]) is now available. This release uses link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.33.md[Kubernetes 1.33] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at https://console.redhat.com/openshift. From the {hybrid-console}, you can deploy {product-title} clusters to either on-premises or cloud environments.

You must use {op-system} machines for the control plane and for the compute machines.
//Removed the note per https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GRPA-3517
//Removed paragraph about the RHEL package because mode workers are removed from 4.19, per Scott Dodson
//Even-numbered release lifecycle verbiage (Comment in for even-numbered releases)

Starting from {product-title} 4.14, the Extended Update Support (EUS) phase for even-numbered releases increases the total available lifecycle to 24 months on all supported architectures, including `x86_64`, 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), and {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architectures. Beyond this, Red{nbsp}Hat also offers a 12-month additional EUS add-on, denoted as _Additional EUS Term 2_, that extends the total available lifecycle from 24 months to 36 months. The Additional EUS Term 2 is available on all architecture variants of {product-title}. For more information about support for all versions, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

//Odd-numbered release lifecycle verbiage (Comment in for odd-numbered releases)
////
The support lifecycle for odd-numbered releases, such as {product-title} {product-version}, on all supported architectures, including `x86_64`, 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), and {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architectures is 18 months. For more information about support for all versions, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

Commencing with the {product-title} 4.14 release, Red{nbsp}Hat is simplifying the administration and management of Red{nbsp}Hat shipped cluster Operators with the introduction of three new life cycle classifications; Platform Aligned, Platform Agnostic, and Rolling Stream. These life cycle classifications provide additional ease and transparency for cluster administrators to understand the life cycle policies of each Operator and form cluster maintenance and upgrade plans with predictable support boundaries. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/j/includes/session/scribe/?redirectTo=https%3A%2F%2Faccess.redhat.com%2Fsupport%2Fpolicy%2Fupdates%2Fopenshift_operators[OpenShift Operator Life Cycles].

// Added in 4.14. Language came directly from Kirsten Newcomer.
{product-title} is designed for FIPS. When running {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures.

For more information about the NIST validation program, see link:https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules[Cryptographic Module Validation Program]. For the latest NIST status for the individual versions of {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted for validation, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2918071#fips-140-2-and-fips-140-3-2[Compliance Activities and Government Standards].

== {product-title} layered and dependent component support and compatibility

The scope of support for layered and dependent components of {product-title} changes independently of the {product-title} version. To determine the current support status and compatibility for an add-on, refer to its release notes. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

[id="ocp-4-20-new-features-and-enhancements_{context}"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts:

[id="ocp-release-notes-auth_{context}"]
=== Authentication and authorization

[id="ocp-release-notes-documentation_{context}"]
=== Documentation

[id="ocp-release-notes-edge-computing_{context}"]
=== Edge computing

[id="ocp-release-edge-computing-networkpolicy-support-for-lvms_{context}"]
==== NetworkPolicy support for the {lvms} Operator

The {lvms} Operator now applies Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` objects during installation to restrict network communication to only the required components. This feature enforces default network isolation for {lvms} deployments on {product-title} clusters.

[id="ocp-release-edge-computing-hostname-label-for-pv_{context}"]
==== Support for hostname labelling for persistent volumes created by using the {lvms} Operator

When you create a persistent volume (PV) by using the {lvms} Operator, the PV now includes the `kubernetes.io/hostname` label. This label shows which node the PV is located on, making it easier to identify the node associated with a workload. This change only applies to newly created PVs. Existing PVs are not modified.

[id="ocp-release-edge-computing-default-namespace_{context}"]
==== Default namespace for the {lvms} Operator

The default namespace for the {lvms} Operator is now `openshift-lvm-storage`. You can still install {lvms} in a custom namespace.

[id="ocp-release-edge-computing-default-clusterinstance_{context}"]
==== SiteConfig CR to ClusterInstance CR migration tool

{product-title} {product-version} introduces the `siteconfig-converter` tool to help migrate managed clusters from using a `SiteConfig` custom resource (CR) to a `ClusterInstance` CR. Using a `SiteConfig` CR to define a managed cluster is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. The `ClusterInstance` CR provides a more unified and generic approach to defining clusters and is the preferred method for managing cluster deployments in the {ztp} workflow. 

Using the `siteconfig-converter` tool, you can convert `SiteConfig` CRs to `ClusterInstance` CRs and then incrementally migrate one or more clusters at a time. Existing and new pipelines run in parallel, so you can migrate clusters in a controlled, phased manner and without downtime.

[NOTE]
====
The `siteconfig-converter` tool does not convert SiteConfig CRs that use the deprecated `spec.clusters.extraManifestPath` field.
====

[id="ocp-release-notes-installation-firewall-updates_{context}"]
==== Firewall requirements when installing a cluster that uses {ibm-title} Cloud Paks

With this release, if you install a cluster using {ibm-title} Cloud Paks, you must allow outbound access to `icr.io` and `cp.icr.io` on port 443. This access is required for {ibm-title} Cloud Pak container images. For more information, see xref:../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[Configuring your firewall].

[id="ocp-release-notes-installation-azure-confidential-vms_{context}"]

[id="ocp-4-20-support-for-bgp-routing-protocol_{context}"]
==== Support for the BGP routing protocol

The Cluster Network Operator (CNO) now supports enabling Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing. With BGP, you can import and export routes to the underlying provider network and use multi-homing, link redundancy, and fast convergence. BGP configuration is managed with the `FRRConfiguration` custom resource (CR).

When upgrading from an earlier version of {product-title} in which you installed the MetalLB Operator, you must manually migrate your custom frr-k8s configurations from the `metallb-system` namespace to the `openshift-frr-k8s` namespace. To move these CRs, enter the following commands:

. To create the `openshift-frr-k8s` namespace, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create namespace openshift-frr-k8s
----

. To automate the migration, create a `migrate.sh` file with the following content:
+
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
OLD_NAMESPACE="metallb-system"
NEW_NAMESPACE="openshift-frr-k8s"
FILTER_OUT="metallb-"
oc get frrconfigurations.frrk8s.metallb.io -n "${OLD_NAMESPACE}" -o json |\
  jq -r '.items[] | select(.metadata.name | test("'"${FILTER_OUT}"'") | not)' |\
  jq -r '.metadata.namespace = "'"${NEW_NAMESPACE}"'"' |\
  oc create -f -
----

. To run the migration script, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ bash migrate.sh
----

. To verify that the migration succeeded, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get frrconfigurations.frrk8s.metallb.io -n openshift-frr-k8s
----

After the migration is complete, you can remove the `FRR-K8s` custom resources from the `metallb-system` namespace.

For more information, see xref:../networking/advanced_networking/bgp_routing/about-bgp-routing.adoc#about-bgp-routing[About BGP routing].

[id="ocp-4-20-support-for-route-advertisements-cudns-with-bgp_{context}"]
==== Support for route advertisements for cluster user-defined networks (CUDNs) with Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)

With route advertisements enabled, the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin supports the direct advertisement of routes for pods and services associated with cluster user-defined networks (CUDNs) to the provider network. This feature enables some of the following benefits:

- Learns routes to pods dynamically
- Advertises routes dynamically
- Enables layer 3 notifications of EgressIP failovers in addition to the layer 2 ones based on gratuitous ARPs.
- Supports external route reflectors, which reduces the number of BGP connections required in large networks

For more information, see xref:../networking/advanced_networking/route_advertisements/about-route-advertisements.adoc#about-route-advertisements[About route advertisements].

[id="ocp-release-notes-ptp-logging-config_{context}"]
==== Configuring enhanced PTP logging

You can now configure enhanced log reduction for the PTP Operator to reduce the volume of logs generated by the `linuxptp-daemon`.

This feature provides a periodic summary of filtered logs, which is not available with basic log reduction. Optionally, you can set a specific interval for the summary logs and a threshold in nanoseconds for the master offset logs.

For more information, see xref:../networking/advanced_networking/ptp/configuring-ptp.adoc#cnf-configuring-enhanced-log-reduction-for-linuxptp_configuring-ptp[Configuring enhanced PTP logging].

[id="ocp-4-20-networking-arm-dual-oc_{context}"]
==== PTP ordinary clocks with added redundancy on AArch64 nodes (Technology Preview)

With this release, you can configure PTP ordinary clocks with added redundancy on AArch64 architecture nodes that use the following dual-port NICs only:

* NVIDIA ConnectX-7 series
* NVIDIA BlueField-3 series, in NIC mode

This feature is available as a Technology Preview. For more information, see xref:../networking/advanced_networking/ptp/about-ptp.adoc#ptp-dual-ports-oc_about-ptp[Using dual-port NICs to improve redundancy for PTP ordinary clocks].

[id="ocp-release-notes-bond-cni-load-balancing_{context}"]
==== Load balancing configuration with bond CNI plugin (Technology Preview)

In this release you can now specify the transmit hash policy for load balancing across the aggregated interfaces with the `xmitHashPolicy` as part of bond CNI plugin configuration. This feature is available as a Technology Preview.

For more information, see xref:../networking/multiple_networks/secondary_networks/creating-secondary-nwt-other-cni.adoc#nw-multus-bond-cni-object_configuring-additional-network-cni[Configuration for a Bond CNI secondary network].

[id="ocp-4-20-networking-namespaced-sriov-app-owners_{context}"]
==== SR-IOV network management in application namespaces

With {product-title} {product-version}, you can now create and manage SR-IOV networks directly within your application namespaces. This new feature provides greater control over your network configurations and helps simplify your workflow.

Previously, creating an SR-IOV network required a cluster administrator to configure it for you. Now, you can manage these resources directly in your own namespace, which offers several key benefits:

* Increased autonomy and control: You can now create your own `SriovNetwork` objects, removing the need to involve a cluster administrator for network configuration tasks.

* Enhanced security: Managing resources within your own namespace improves security by providing better separation between applications and helps prevent unintentional misconfigurations.

* Simplified permissions: You can now simplify permissions and reduce operational overhead by using namespaced SR-IOV networks.

For more information, see xref:../networking/hardware_networks/configuring-namespaced-sriov-resources.html#configuring-namespaced-sriov-resources[Configuring namespaced SR-IOV resources].

[id="ocp-oc-adm-upgrade-recommend_{context}"]
==== Introducing the oc adm upgrade recommend command (General Availability)

Formerly Technology Preview and now Generally Available, the `oc adm upgrade recommend` command allows system administrators to perform a pre-update check on their {product-title} clusters using the command line interface (CLI). The pre-update check helps identify potential issues, enabling users to address them before initiating an update. By running the precheck command and inspecting the output, users can prepare for updating their cluster and make informed decisions about when to start an update.

[id="ocp-release-notes-numa-resources-operator-replicas_{context}"]
==== Configuring NUMA-aware scheduler replicas and high availability (Technology Preview)

In {product-title} {product-version}, the NUMA Resources Operator automatically enables high availability (HA) mode by default. In this mode, the NUMA Resources Operator creates one scheduler replica for each control-plane node in the cluster to ensure redundancy. This default behavior occurs if the `spec.replicas` field is not specified in the `NUMAResourcesScheduler` Custom Resource (CR). Alternatively, you can explicitly set a specific number of scheduler replicas to override the default HA behavior or disable the scheduler entirely by setting the `spec.replicas` field to `0`.

For more information, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/cnf-numa-aware-scheduling.adoc#cnf-managing-ha-nrop_numa-aware[Managing high availability (HA) for the NUMA-aware scheduler].

[id="ocp-4-20-receive-packet-steering-disabled_{context}"]
==== Receive Packet Steering (RPS) is now disabled by default

With this release, Receive Packet Steering (RPS) is no longer configured when Performance Profile is applied. The RPS configuration affects containers that perform networking system calls, such as send, directly within latency-sensitive threads. To avoid latency impacts when RPS is not configured, move networking calls to helper threads or processes.

The previous RPS configuration resolved latency issues at the expense of overall pod kernel networking performance. The current default configuration promotes transparency by requiring developers to address the underlying application design instead of obscuring performance impacts.

To revert to the previous behavior, add the `performance.openshift.io/enable-rps` annotation to the PerformanceProfile manifest:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
kind: PerformanceProfile
metadata:
  name: example-performanceprofile
  annotations:
    performance.openshift.io/enable-rps: "enable"
----

[NOTE]
====
This action restores the prior functionality at the cost of globally reducing networking performance for all pods.

With this update, the oc-mirror plugin v2 now verifies information such as registry credentials, DNS name, and SSL certificates before populating the cache and beginning mirroring operations.
This prevents users from discovering certain problems only after the cache is populated and mirroring has begun.
