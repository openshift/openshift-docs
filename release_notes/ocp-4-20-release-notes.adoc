Red{nbsp}Hat {product-title} provides developers and IT organizations with a hybrid cloud application platform for deploying both new and existing applications on secure, scalable resources with minimal configuration and management. {product-title} supports a wide selection of programming languages and frameworks, such as Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and PHP.

Built on {op-system-base-full} and Kubernetes, {product-title} provides a more secure and scalable multitenant operating system for today's enterprise-class applications, while delivering integrated application runtimes and libraries. {product-title} enables organizations to meet security, privacy, compliance, and governance requirements.

== About this release

// TODO: Update with the relevant information closer to release.
{product-title} (link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-202X:XXXX[RHSA-202X:XXXXX]) is now available. This release uses link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.33.md[Kubernetes 1.33] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at https://console.redhat.com/openshift. From the {hybrid-console}, you can deploy {product-title} clusters to either on-premises or cloud environments.

You must use {op-system} machines for the control plane and for the compute machines.
//Removed the note per https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GRPA-3517
//Removed paragraph about the RHEL package because mode workers are removed from 4.19, per Scott Dodson
//Even-numbered release lifecycle verbiage (Comment in for even-numbered releases)

Starting from {product-title} 4.14, the Extended Update Support (EUS) phase for even-numbered releases increases the total available lifecycle to 24 months on all supported architectures, including `x86_64`, 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), and {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architectures. Beyond this, Red{nbsp}Hat also offers a 12-month additional EUS add-on, denoted as _Additional EUS Term 2_, that extends the total available lifecycle from 24 months to 36 months. The Additional EUS Term 2 is available on all architecture variants of {product-title}. For more information about support for all versions, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

//Odd-numbered release lifecycle verbiage (Comment in for odd-numbered releases)
////
The support lifecycle for odd-numbered releases, such as {product-title} {product-version}, on all supported architectures, including `x86_64`, 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), and {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architectures is 18 months. For more information about support for all versions, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

Commencing with the {product-title} 4.14 release, Red{nbsp}Hat is simplifying the administration and management of Red{nbsp}Hat shipped cluster Operators with the introduction of three new life cycle classifications; Platform Aligned, Platform Agnostic, and Rolling Stream. These life cycle classifications provide additional ease and transparency for cluster administrators to understand the life cycle policies of each Operator and form cluster maintenance and upgrade plans with predictable support boundaries. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/j/includes/session/scribe/?redirectTo=https%3A%2F%2Faccess.redhat.com%2Fsupport%2Fpolicy%2Fupdates%2Fopenshift_operators[OpenShift Operator Life Cycles].
////

// Added in 4.14. Language came directly from Kirsten Newcomer.
{product-title} is designed for FIPS. When running {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures.

For more information about the NIST validation program, see link:https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules[Cryptographic Module Validation Program]. For the latest NIST status for the individual versions of {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted for validation, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2918071#fips-140-2-and-fips-140-3-2[Compliance Activities and Government Standards].

== {product-title} layered and dependent component support and compatibility

The scope of support for layered and dependent components of {product-title} changes independently of the {product-title} version. To determine the current support status and compatibility for an add-on, refer to its release notes. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

[id="ocp-4-20-new-features-and-enhancements_{context}"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts:

[id="ocp-release-notes-auth_{context}"]
=== Authentication and authorization

[id="ocp-release-notes-documentation_{context}"]
=== Documentation

[id="ocp-release-notes-edge-computing_{context}"]
=== Edge computing

[id="ocp-release-edge-computing-networkpolicy-support-for-lvms_{context}"]
==== NetworkPolicy support for the {lvms} Operator

The {lvms} Operator now applies Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` objects during installation to restrict network communication to only the required components. This feature enforces default network isolation for {lvms} deployments on {product-title} clusters.

[id="ocp-release-edge-computing-hostname-label-for-pv_{context}"]
==== Support for hostname labelling for persistent volumes created by using the {lvms} Operator

When you create a persistent volume (PV) by using the {lvms} Operator, the PV now includes the `kubernetes.io/hostname` label. This label shows which node the PV is located on, making it easier to identify the node associated with a workload. This change only applies to newly created PVs. Existing PVs are not modified.

[id="ocp-release-edge-computing-default-namespace_{context}"]
==== Default namespace for the {lvms} Operator

The default namespace for the {lvms} Operator is now `openshift-lvm-storage`. You can still install {lvms} in a custom namespace.

[id="ocp-release-notes-extensions_{context}"]
=== Extensions ({olmv1})

[id="ocp-release-notes-hcp_{context}"]
=== Hosted control planes

Because {hcp} releases asynchronously from {product-title}, it has its own release notes. For more information, see xref:../hosted_control_planes/hosted-control-planes-release-notes.adoc#hosted-control-planes-release-notes[{hcp-capital} release notes].

[id="ocp-release-notes-ibm-power_{context}"]
=== {ibm-power-title}

[id="ocp-release-notes-ibm-z_{context}"]
=== {ibm-z-title} and {ibm-linuxone-title}

The {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name} release on {product-title} {product-version} adds improvements and new capabilities to {product-title} components.

This release introduces support for the following features on {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name}:

[discrete]
[id="ocp-release-notes-ibm-z-power-support-matrix_{context}"]

.Known Gateway API issues

* By default, `istiod` will create a ConfigMap `istio-ca-root-cert` in every namespace it watches, which can create unnecessary ConfigMaps. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-9076[OSSM-9076])

* When using Gateway API via the Cluster Ingress Operator (CIO), any Istio specific resources (e.g. VirtualService) are not allowed or supported. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-9154[OSSM-9154])

* Gateway API on CIO can be broken by an existing  incompatible OpenShift Service Mesh (OSSM) subscription. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NE-1964[NE-1964])

* Currently Gateway API is not supported for on-premise platforms: BareMetal, VSphere, oVirt, KubeVirt, EquinixMetal, Nutanix. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NE-2010[NE-2010])

* The reverse proxy for Gateway API is known to be less performant than HAProxy. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NE-1990[NE-1990]) and (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-9095[OSSM-9095])

Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming {product-title} entitlements for {product-title} errata notification emails to generate.
====

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of {product-title} {product-version}. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form {product-title} {product-version}.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any {product-title} release, always review the instructions on xref:../updating/updating_a_cluster/updating-cluster-web-console.adoc#updating-cluster-web-console[updating your cluster] properly.
