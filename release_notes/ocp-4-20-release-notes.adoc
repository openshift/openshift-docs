== About this release

// TODO: Update with the relevant information closer to release.
{product-title} (link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-202X:XXXX[RHSA-202X:XXXXX]) is now available. This release uses link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.33.md[Kubernetes 1.33] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at https://console.redhat.com/openshift. From the {hybrid-console}, you can deploy {product-title} clusters to either on-premises or cloud environments.

You must use {op-system} machines for the control plane and for the compute machines.
//Removed the note per https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GRPA-3517
//Removed paragraph about the RHEL package because mode workers are removed from 4.19, per Scott Dodson
//Even-numbered release lifecycle verbiage (Comment in for even-numbered releases)

Starting from {product-title} 4.14, the Extended Update Support (EUS) phase for even-numbered releases increases the total available lifecycle to 24 months on all supported architectures, including `x86_64`, 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), and {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architectures. Beyond this, Red{nbsp}Hat also offers a 12-month additional EUS add-on, denoted as _Additional EUS Term 2_, that extends the total available lifecycle from 24 months to 36 months. The Additional EUS Term 2 is available on all architecture variants of {product-title}. For more information about support for all versions, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

//Odd-numbered release lifecycle verbiage (Comment in for odd-numbered releases)
////
The support lifecycle for odd-numbered releases, such as {product-title} {product-version}, on all supported architectures, including `x86_64`, 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), and {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architectures is 18 months. For more information about support for all versions, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

Commencing with the {product-title} 4.14 release, Red{nbsp}Hat is simplifying the administration and management of Red{nbsp}Hat shipped cluster Operators with the introduction of three new life cycle classifications; Platform Aligned, Platform Agnostic, and Rolling Stream. These life cycle classifications provide additional ease and transparency for cluster administrators to understand the life cycle policies of each Operator and form cluster maintenance and upgrade plans with predictable support boundaries. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/j/includes/session/scribe/?redirectTo=https%3A%2F%2Faccess.redhat.com%2Fsupport%2Fpolicy%2Fupdates%2Fopenshift_operators[OpenShift Operator Life Cycles].

// Added in 4.14. Language came directly from Kirsten Newcomer.
{product-title} is designed for FIPS. When running {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures.

For more information about the NIST validation program, see link:https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules[Cryptographic Module Validation Program]. For the latest NIST status for the individual versions of {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted for validation, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2918071#fips-140-2-and-fips-140-3-2[Compliance Activities and Government Standards].

To determine the current support status and compatibility for an add-on, refer to its release notes. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

[id="ocp-4-20-new-features-and-enhancements_{context}"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts:

[id="ocp-release-notes-api_{context}"]
=== API server

==== Extended loopback certificate validity to three years for kube-apiserver

Before this update, the self-signed loopback certificate for the Kubernetes API Server expired after one year. With this release, the expiration date of the certificate is extended to three years.

==== Dry-run option is connected to 'oc delete istag'

Before this update, deleting an `istag` resource with the `--dry-run=server` option unintentionally caused actual deletion of the image from the server. This unexpected deletion occurred due to the `dry-run` option being implemented incorrectly in the `oc delete istag` command. With this release, the `dry-run` option is wired to the `oc delete istag` command. As a result, the accidental deletion of image objects is prevented and the `istag` object remains intact when using the `--dry-run=server` option.

[id="ocp-release-notes-auth_{context}"]
=== Authentication and authorization

[id="ocp-release-notes-documentation_{context}"]
=== Documentation

[id="ocp-release-notes-edge-computing_{context}"]
=== Edge computing

[id="ocp-release-edge-computing-networkpolicy-support-for-lvms_{context}"]
==== NetworkPolicy support for the {lvms} Operator

The {lvms} Operator now applies Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` objects during installation to restrict network communication to only the required components. This feature enforces default network isolation for {lvms} deployments on {product-title} clusters.

[id="ocp-release-edge-computing-hostname-label-for-pv_{context}"]
==== Support for hostname labelling for persistent volumes created by using the {lvms} Operator

When you create a persistent volume (PV) by using the {lvms} Operator, the PV now includes the `kubernetes.io/hostname` label. This label shows which node the PV is located on, making it easier to identify the node associated with a workload. This change only applies to newly created PVs. Existing PVs are not modified.

[id="ocp-release-edge-computing-default-namespace_{context}"]
==== Default namespace for the {lvms} Operator

The default namespace for the {lvms} Operator is now `openshift-lvm-storage`. You can still install {lvms} in a custom namespace.

[id="ocp-release-edge-computing-default-clusterinstance_{context}"]
==== SiteConfig CR to ClusterInstance CR migration tool

{product-title} {product-version} introduces the `siteconfig-converter` tool to help migrate managed clusters from using a `SiteConfig` custom resource (CR) to a `ClusterInstance` CR. Using a `SiteConfig` CR to define a managed cluster is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. The `ClusterInstance` CR provides a more unified and generic approach to defining clusters and is the preferred method for managing cluster deployments in the {ztp} workflow.

Using the `siteconfig-converter` tool, you can convert `SiteConfig` CRs to `ClusterInstance` CRs and then incrementally migrate one or more clusters at a time. Existing and new pipelines run in parallel, so you can migrate clusters in a controlled, phased manner and without downtime.

[NOTE]
====
The `siteconfig-converter` tool does not convert SiteConfig CRs that use the deprecated `spec.clusters.extraManifestPath` field.
====

For more information, see xref:../edge_computing/ztp-migrate-clusterinstance.adoc#ztp-migrate-clusterinstance[Migrating from SiteConfig CRs to ClusterInstance CRs].

[id="ocp-release-notes-extensions_{context}"]
=== Extensions ({olmv1})

[id="ocp-release-notes-extensions-webhooks-tp_{context}"]
==== Deploying cluster extensions that use webhooks (Technology Preview)

With this release, you can deploy cluster extensions that use webhooks on clusters with the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set enabled.

For more information, see xref:../extensions/ce/managing-ce.adoc#olmv1-supported-extensions_managing-ce[Supported extensions].

[id="ocp-release-notes-hcp_{context}"]
=== Hosted control planes

Because {hcp} releases asynchronously from {product-title}, it has its own release notes. For more information, see xref:../hosted_control_planes/hosted-control-planes-release-notes.adoc#hosted-control-planes-release-notes[{hcp-capital} release notes].

[id="ocp-release-notes-ibm-power_{context}"]
=== {ibm-power-title}

The {ibm-power-name} release on {product-title} {product-version} adds improvements and new capabilities to {product-title} components.

This release introduces support for the following features on {ibm-power-title}:

* Enable accelerators on {ibm-power-name}

[id="ocp-release-notes-ibm-z_{context}"]
=== {ibm-z-title} and {ibm-linuxone-title}

The {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name} release on {product-title} {product-version} adds improvements and new capabilities to {product-title} components.

This release introduces support for the following features on {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name}:

* Enable accelerators on {ibm-z-name}

[id="ocp-release-notes-ibm-z-power-support-matrix_{context}"]
=== {ibm-power-title}, {ibm-z-title}, and {ibm-linuxone-title} support matrix

Starting in {product-title} 4.14, Extended Update Support (EUS) is extended to the {ibm-power-name} and the {ibm-z-name} platform. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift-eus[OpenShift EUS Overview].

[id="ocp-release-notes-installation-gcp-xpn-dns-zones_{context}"]
==== Installing a cluster on {gcp-full} into a shared VPC specifying a DNS private zone in a third project

With this release, you can specify the location of a DNS private zone when installing a cluster on {gcp-short} into a shared VPC. The private zone can be located in a service project that is distinct from the host project or main service project.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_gcp/installation-config-parameters-gcp.adoc#installation-configuration-parameters-additional-gcp_installation-config-parameters-gcp[Additional {gcp-short} configuration parameters].

[id="ocp-release-notes-installation-azure-encrypted-vnet_{context}"]
==== Installing a cluster on {azure-full} with virtual network encryption

With this release, you can install a cluster on {azure-short} using encrypted virtual networks. You are required to use {azure-short} virtual machines that have the `premiumIO` parameter set to `true`. See Microsoft's documentation about link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/how-to-create-encryption?tabs=portal[Creating a virtual network with encryption] and link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-encryption-overview#requirements[Requirements and Limitations] for more information.

[id="ocp-release-notes-installation-firewall-updates_{context}"]
==== Firewall requirements when installing a cluster that uses {ibm-title} Cloud Paks

With this release, if you install a cluster using {ibm-title} Cloud Paks, you must allow outbound access to `icr.io` and `cp.icr.io` on port 443. This access is required for {ibm-title} Cloud Pak container images. For more information, see xref:../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[Configuring your firewall].

[id="ocp-release-notes-installation-azure-confidential-vms_{context}"]
==== Installing a cluster on {azure-full} using Intel TDX Confidential VMs

With this release, you can install a cluster on {azure-short} using Intel-based Confidential VMs. The following machine sizes are now supported:

* DCesv5-series
* DCedsv5-series
* ECesv5-series
* ECedsv5-series

[id="ocp-release-notes-installation-azure-dedicated-disk-etcd_{context}"]
==== Dedicated disk for etcd on {azure-full} (Technology Preview)

With this release, you can install your {product-title} cluster on {azure-short} with a dedicated data disk for `etcd`. This configuration attaches a separate managed disk to each control plane node and uses it only for `etcd` data, which can improve cluster performance and stability. This feature is available as a Technology Preview. For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_azure/ipi/installing-azure-customizations.adoc#installation-azure-dedicated-disks_installing-azure-customizations[Configuring a dedicated disk for etcd].

[id="ocp-release-notes-installation-bm-multiarch_{context}"]
==== Multi-architecture support for bare metal
With this release, you can install a bare-metal environment that supports multi-architecture capabilities. You can provision both `x86_64` and `aarch64` architectures from an existing `x86_64` cluster by using virtual media, meaning you can manage a diverse hardware environment more efficiently.

For more information, see xref:../post_installation_configuration/configuring-multi-arch-compute-machines/multi-architecture-configuration.adoc#configuring-your-cluster-with-multi-architecture-compute-machines[Configuring your cluster with multi-architecture compute machines].

[id="ocp-release-notes-installation-nic-firmware-updates_{context}"]
==== Support for updating the host firmware components of NICs for bare metal
With this release, the `HostFirmwareComponents` resource for bare metal describes network interface controllers (NICs). To update NIC host firmware components, the server must support Redfish and must permit you to use Redfish to update NIC firmware.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal/bare-metal-postinstallation-configuration.adoc#bmo-about-the-hostfirmwarecomponents-resource_bare-metal-postinstallation-configuration[About the HostFirmwareComponents resource].

[id="ocp-4-20-admin-ack-updating_{context}"]
==== Required administrator acknowledgment when updating from {product-title} 4.19 to 4.20

In {product-title} 4.17, a previously xref:../release_notes/ocp-4-20-release-notes.adoc#ocp-4-20-removed-kube-apis_release-notes[removed Kubernetes API] was inadvertently reintroduced. It has been removed again in {product-title} 4.20.

Before a cluster can be updated from {product-title} 4.19 to 4.20, a cluster administrator must manually provide acknowledgment. This safeguard helps to prevent update issues that could occur if workloads, tools, or other components still depend on the Kubernetes API that has been removed in {product-title} 4.20.

Administrators must take the following actions before proceeding with the cluster update:

. Evaluate the cluster for the use of APIs that will be removed.
. Migrate the affected manifests, workloads, and API clients to use the supported API version.
. Provide the administrator acknowledgment that all necessary updates have been made.

All {product-title} 4.19 clusters require this administrator acknowledgment before they can be updated to {product-title} 4.20.

For more information, see xref:../updating/preparing_for_updates/updating-cluster-prepare.adoc#kube-api-removals_updating-cluster-prepare[Kubernetes API removals].

[id="ocp-release-notes-machine-config-operator_{context}"]
=== Machine Config Operator

[id="ocp-release-notes-machine-config-operator-boot_{context}"]
==== Updated boot images for vSphere now supported (Technology Preview)

Updated boot images is now supported as a Technology Preview feature for {vmw-first} clusters. This feature allows you configure your cluster to update the node boot image whenever you update your cluster. By default, the boot image in your cluster is not updated along with your cluster. For more information, see xref:../machine_configuration/mco-update-boot-images.adoc#mco-update-boot-images[Updated boot images].

[id="ocp-release-notes-machine-config-operator-ocl-ga_{context}"]
==== {image-mode-os-on-caps} reboot improvements

The following machine configuration changes no longer cause a reboot of nodes with on-cluster custom layered images:

* Modifying the configuration files in the `/var` or `/etc` directory
* Adding or modifying a systemd service
* Changing SSH keys
* Removing mirroring rules from `ICSP`, `ITMS`, and `IDMS` objects
* Changing the trusted CA, by updating the `user-ca-bundle` configmap in the `openshift-config` namespace

For more information, see xref:../machine_configuration/mco-coreos-layering.adoc#coreos-layering-configuring-on-limitations_mco-coreos-layering[On-cluster image mode known limitations].

[id="ocp-release-notes-machine-config-operator-boot-image_{context}"]
==== {image-mode-os-on-caps} status reporting improvements

When {image-mode-os-lower} is configured, there are improvements to error reporting including the following changes:

* In certain scenarios after the custom layered image has been built and pushed, errors could cause the build process to fail. If this happens, the MCO now reports the errors and the `machineosbuild` object and builder pod are reported as failed.

* The `oc describe mcp` output has a new `ImageBuildDegraded` status field that reports if a custom layered image build has failed.

[id="ocp-release-notes-machine-config-operator-cert-changes_{context}"]
==== Setting the kernel type parameter is now supported on {image-mode-os-on-lower} nodes

You can now use the `kernelType` parameter in a `MachineConfig` object on nodes with on-cluster custom layered images in order to install a realtime kernel on the node. Previously, on nodes with on-cluster custom layered images the `kernelType` parameter was ignored. For information, see xref:../machine_configuration/machine-configs-configure.adoc#nodes-nodes-rtkernel-arguments_machine-configs-configure[Adding a real-time kernel to nodes].

[id="ocp-release-notes-machine-config-operator-pin_{context}"]
==== Pinning images to nodes

In clusters with slow, unreliable connections to an image registry, you can use a `PinnedImageSet` object to pull the images in advance, before they are needed, then associate those images with a machine config pool. This ensures that the images are available to the nodes in that pool when needed. The `must-gather` for the Machine Config Operator includes all `PinnedImageSet` objects in the cluster. For more information, see xref:../machine_configuration/machine-config-pin-preload-images-about.adoc#machine-config-pin-preload-images_machine-config-operator[Pinning images to nodes].

[id="ocp-release-notes-machine-config-operator-mcn_{context}"]
==== Improved MCO state reporting is now generally available

The machine config nodes custom resource, which you can use to monitor the progress of machine configuration updates to nodes, is now generally available.

You can now view the status of updates to custom machine config pools in addition to the control plane and worker pools. The functionality for the feature has not changed. However, some of the information in the command output and in the status fields in the `MachineConfigNode` object has been updated. The `must-gather` for the Machine Config Operator now includes all `MachineConfigNodes` objects in the cluster. For more information, see xref:../machine_configuration/index.adoc#checking-mco-node-status_machine-config-overview[About checking machine config node status].

[id="ocp-release-notes-auth-hostmount-anyuid-v2-scc_{context}"]
==== Enabling direct

This release includes a new security context constraint (SCC), named `hostmount-anyuid-v2`. This SCC provides the same features as the `hostmount-anyuid` SCC, but contains `seLinuxContext: RunAsAny`. This SCC was added because the `hostmount-anyuid` SCC was intended to allow trusted pods to access any paths on the host, but SELinux prevents containers from accessing most paths. The `hostmount-anyuid-v2` allows host file system access as any UID, including UID 0, and is intended to be used instead of the `privileged` SCC. Grant with caution.

[id="ocp-release-notes-machine-management_{context}"]
=== Machine management

[id="ocp-4-20-capi-aws-capacity-preferences_{context}"]
==== Additional {aws-short} Capacity Reservation configuration options

On clusters that manage machines with the Cluster API, you can specify additional constraints to determine whether your compute machines use {aws-short} capacity reservations. For more information, see xref:../machine_management/cluster_api_machine_management/cluster_api_provider_configurations/cluster-api-config-options-aws.adoc#machine-feature-agnostic-capacity-reservation_cluster-api-config-options-aws[Capacity Reservation configuration options].

[id="ocp-release-notes-machine-management-ca-scale-up_{context}"]
==== Cluster autoscaler scale up delay

You can now configure a delay before the cluster autoscaler recognizes newly pending pods and schedules the pods to a new node by using the `spec.scaleUp.newPodScaleUpDelay` parameter in the `ClusterAutoscaler` CR. If the node remains unscheduled after the delay, the cluster autoscaler can scale up a new node. This delay gives the cluster autoscaler additional time to locate an appropriate node or it can wait for space on an existing pod to become available. For more information, see xref:../machine_management/applying-autoscaling.adoc#configuring-clusterautoscaler_applying-autoscaling[Configuring the cluster autoscaler].

[id="ocp-4-20-release-notes-monitoring_{context}"]
=== Monitoring

The in-cluster monitoring stack for this release includes the following new and modified features:

[id="ocp-4-20-monitoring-updates-to-monitoring-stack-components-and-dependencies"]
==== Updates to monitoring stack components and dependencies

This release includes the following version updates for in-cluster monitoring stack components and dependencies:

* Prometheus to 3.5.0

==== Support for Gateway API Inference Extension

{product-title} {product-version} updates {SMProductName} to version 3.1.0, which now supports {rhoai-full}. This version update incorporates essential CVE fixes, resolves other bugs, and upgrades Istio to version 1.26.2 for improved security and performance. See the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_mesh/3.1/html/release_notes/ossm-release-notes[{SMProductShortName} 3.1.0 release notes] for more information.

[id="ocp-4-20-support-for-bgp-routing-protocol_{context}"]
==== Support for the BGP routing protocol

The Cluster Network Operator (CNO) now supports enabling Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing. With BGP, you can import and export routes to the underlying provider network and use multi-homing, link redundancy, and fast convergence. BGP configuration is managed with the `FRRConfiguration` custom resource (CR).

When upgrading from an earlier version of {product-title} in which you installed the MetalLB Operator, you must manually migrate your custom frr-k8s configurations from the `metallb-system` namespace to the `openshift-frr-k8s` namespace. To move these CRs, enter the following commands:

. To create the `openshift-frr-k8s` namespace, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create namespace openshift-frr-k8s
----

. To automate the migration, create a `migrate.sh` file with the following content:
+
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
OLD_NAMESPACE="metallb-system"
NEW_NAMESPACE="openshift-frr-k8s"
FILTER_OUT="metallb-"
oc get frrconfigurations.frrk8s.metallb.io -n "${OLD_NAMESPACE}" -o json |\
  jq -r '.items[] | select(.metadata.name | test("'"${FILTER_OUT}"'") | not)' |\
  jq -r '.metadata.namespace = "'"${NEW_NAMESPACE}"'"' |\
  oc create -f -
----

. To run the migration script, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ bash migrate.sh
----

. To verify that the migration succeeded, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get frrconfigurations.frrk8s.metallb.io -n openshift-frr-k8s
----

After the migration is complete, you can remove the `FRR-K8s` custom resources from the `metallb-system` namespace.

[id="ocp-4-20-support-for-route-advertisements-cudns-with-bgp_{context}"]
==== Support for route advertisements for cluster user-defined networks (CUDNs) with Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)

With route advertisements enabled, the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin supports the direct advertisement of routes for pods and services associated with cluster user-defined networks (CUDNs) to the provider network. This feature enables some of the following benefits:

- Learns routes to pods dynamically
- Advertises routes dynamically
- Enables layer 3 notifications of EgressIP failovers in addition to the layer 2 ones based on gratuitous ARPs.
- Supports external route reflectors, which reduces the number of BGP connections required in large networks

For more information, see xref:../networking/advanced_networking/route_advertisements/about-route-advertisements.adoc#about-route-advertisements[About route advertisements].

[id="ocp-4-20-tech-preview-PreconfiguredUDNAddresses_{context}"]
====  Preconfigured user-defined network endpoints only for use with {mtv-first} (Technology Preview)

Preconfigured user-defined network endpoints is available as a Technology Preview and controlled by the feature gate, `PreconfiguredUDNAddresses`. You can now explicitly control the overlay network configuration including: IP address, MAC address, and default gateway. This feature is available for Layer 2 as part of the `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` (CUDN) custom resource (CR). Administrators can preconfigure endpoints to migrate KubeVirt virtual machines (VMs) without disruption. To enable the feature use the new fields, `reservedSubnets`, `infrastructureSubnets`, and `defaultGatewayIPs`, found in the CUDN CR. For more information about the configurations, see xref:../networking/multiple_networks/primary_networks/about-user-defined-networks.adoc#nw-udn-additional-config-details_about-user-defined-networks[Additional configuration details for user-defined networks]. Currently, static IP addresses are only supported for the `ClusterUserDefinedNetworks` CR and only for use with {mtv-short}.

[id="ocp-4-20-migration-configure-ovs-nmstate_{context}"]
==== Support for migrating a configured br-ex bridge to NMState

==== SR-IOV network management in application namespaces

With {product-title} {product-version}, you can now create and manage SR-IOV networks directly within your application namespaces. This new feature provides greater control over your network configurations and helps simplify your workflow.

Previously, creating an SR-IOV network required a cluster administrator to configure it for you. Now, you can manage these resources directly in your own namespace, which offers several key benefits:

* Increased autonomy and control: You can now create your own `SriovNetwork` objects, removing the need to involve a cluster administrator for network configuration tasks.

* Enhanced security: Managing resources within your own namespace improves security by providing better separation between applications and helps prevent unintentional misconfigurations.

* Simplified permissions: You can now simplify permissions and reduce operational overhead by using namespaced SR-IOV networks.

[id="ocp-4-20-networking-pfrs-operator_{context}"]
==== High-availability for pod-level bonding on SR-IOV networks (Technology Preview)

This Technology Preview feature introduces the PF Status Relay Operator. The Operator uses Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) as a health check to detect upstream switch failures, enabling high availability for workloads that use pod-level bonding with SR-IOV network virtual functions (VF).

Without this feature, an upstream switch can fail while the underlying physical function (PF) still reports an `up` state. VFs attached to the PF also remain up, causing pods to send traffic to a dead endpoint and leading to packet loss.

The PF Status Relay Operator prevents this by monitoring the LACP status of the PF. When a failure is detected, the Operator forces the link state of the attached VFs down, triggering the pod's bond to fail over to a backup path. This ensures the workload remains available and minimizes packet loss.

For more information, see xref:../networking/hardware_networks/configure-lacp-for-sriov.adoc#sriov-lacp-sriov[High availability for pod-level bonds on SR-IOV networks].

==== Configuring NUMA-aware scheduler replicas and high availability (Technology Preview)

In {product-title} {product-version}, the NUMA Resources Operator automatically enables high availability (HA) mode by default. In this mode, the NUMA Resources Operator creates one scheduler replica for each control-plane node in the cluster to ensure redundancy. This default behavior occurs if the `spec.replicas` field is not specified in the `NUMAResourcesScheduler` custom resource. Alternatively, you can explicitly set a specific number of scheduler replicas to override the default HA behavior or disable the scheduler entirely by setting the `spec.replicas` field to `0`. The maximum number of replicas is 3, even if the number of control plane nodes exceeds 3.

[id="ocp-4-20-receive-packet-steering-disabled_{context}"]
==== Receive Packet Steering (RPS) is now disabled by default

With this release, Receive Packet Steering (RPS) is no longer configured when Performance Profile is applied. The RPS configuration affects containers that perform networking system calls, such as send, directly within latency-sensitive threads. To avoid latency impacts when RPS is not configured, move networking calls to helper threads or processes.

The previous RPS configuration resolved latency issues at the expense of overall pod kernel networking performance. The current default configuration promotes transparency by requiring developers to address the underlying application design instead of obscuring performance impacts.

To revert to the previous behavior, add the `performance.openshift.io/enable-rps` annotation to the PerformanceProfile manifest:

[source,yaml]

[id="ocp-release-notes-storage-vol-populators_{context}"]
==== Volume populators are generally available

The volume populators feature allows you to create pre-populated volumes.

{product-title} 4.20 introduces a new field `dataSourceRef` for volume populator functionality that expands the objects that can be used as a data source for pre-population of volumes, from only persistent volume claims (PVC) and snapshots, to any appropriate custom resource (CR).

{product-title} now ships `volume-data-source-validator`, which reports events on PVCs that use a volume populator without a corresponding `VolumePopulator` instance. Previous {product-title} versions did not require `VolumePopulator` instances, so if you are upgrading from 4.12, or later, you might receive events about unregistered populators. If you installed `volume-data-source-validator` yourself previously, you can remove your version.

The volume populators feature, which was introduced in {product-title} 4.12 as a Technology Preview feature, is now supported as generally available.

Volume population is enabled by default. However, {product-title} does not ship with any volume populators.

[id="ocp-release-notes-storage-storage-security-policy_{context}"]
==== Configuring fsGroupChangePolicy and seLinuxChangePolicy at namespace and pod level

Certain operations of a volume can cause pod startup delays, which might cause pod timeouts.

*fsGroup:*
For volumes with many files, pod startup timeouts can occur because, by default, {product-title} recursively changes ownership and permissions for the contents of each volume to match the `fsGroup` specified in a pod’s `securityContext` when that volume is mounted. This can be time consuming, slowing pod startup. You can use the `fsGroupChangePolicy` parameter inside a `securityContext` to control the way that {product-title} checks and manages ownership and permissions for a volume.

Changing this parameter at the pod level was introduced in {product-title} 4.10. In 4.20, you can set this parameter at the namespace level, in addition to the pod level, as a generally available feature.

*SELinux:*
SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is a security mechanism that assigns security labels (contexts) to all objects (files, processes, network ports, etc.) on a system. These labels determine what a process can access. When a pod starts, the container runtime recursively relabels all files on a volume to match a pod’s SELinux context. For volumes with a lot of files, this can significantly increase pod startup times. Mount option specifies avoiding recursive relabeling of all files by attempting to mount the volume with the correct SELinux label directly using the -o context mount option, thus helping to avoid pod timeout problems.

*RWOP and SELinux mount option:*
ReadWriteOncePod (RWOP) persistent volumes use the SELinux mount feature by default. Mount option was introduced in {product-title} 4.15 as a Technology Preview feature, and became generally available in 4.16.

*RWO and RWX and SELinux mount option:*
ReadWriteOnce (RWO) and ReadWriteMany (RWX) volumes use recursive relabeling by default. Mount option for RWO/RWX was introduced in {product-title} 4.17 as a Developer Preview feature, but is now supported in 4.20 as a Technology Preview feature.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In a future {product-title} version, RWO and RWX volumes will use mount option by default.
====

To assist you with the upcoming move to the mount option default, {product-title} 4.20 reports SELinux-related conflicts when creating pods, and on running pods, to make you aware of potential conflicts, and to help you resolve them. For more information about this reporting, see this link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7131398[KB article].

If you are unable to resolve the SELinux-related conflicts, you can proactively opt-out of the future move to mount option as default for selected pods or namespaces.

In {product-title} 4.20, you can evaluate the mount option feature for RWO and RWX volumes as a Technology Preview feature.

[id="ocp-release-notes-storage-honor-vol-reclaim-policy_{context}"]
==== Always honor persistent volume reclaim policy is generally available

Before {product-title} 4.18, the persistent volume (PV) reclaim policy was not always applied.

For a bound PV and persistent volume claim (PVC) pair, the ordering of PV-PVC deletion determined whether the PV delete reclaim policy was applied or not. The PV applied the reclaim policy if the PVC was deleted before deleting the PV. However, if the PV was deleted before deleting the PVC, then the reclaim policy was not applied. As a result of that behavior, the associated storage asset in the external infrastructure was not removed.

Starting with {product-title} 4.18, the PV reclaim policy is consistently always applied as a Technical Preview feature. With {product-title} 4.20, this feature is generally available.

For more information, see xref:../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#reclaiming_understanding-persistent-storage[Reclaim policy for persistent volumes].

[id="ocp-release-notes-storage-csi-manila-multiple-cdir_{context}"]
==== Manila CSI driver allows multiple CIDRs when creating NFS volumes is generally available

By default, {product-title} creates Manila storage classes that provide access to all IPv4 clients, with the possibility of updating it to a single IP address or subnet. In {product-title} 4.20, you can limit client access by defining custom storage classes that use multiple client IP addresses or subnets by using the `nfs-ShareClient` parameter.

This feature is generally available in {product-title} 4.20.

The name of the `MachineOSConfig` object used with {image-mode-os-on-lower} must now be the same as the machine config pool where you want to deploy the custom layered image. Previously, you could use any name. This change was made to prevent attempts to use multiple `MachineOSConfig` objects with each machine config pool.

As a consequence, this inaccurate reporting might have affected workload placement by the NUMA-aware scheduler.
+
With this release, kubelet no longer reports resources for terminated pods, which results in accurate workload placement by the NUMA-aware scheduler. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-56785[OCPBUGS-56785)

[id="ocp-release-note-bare-metal-hardware-bug-fixes_{context}"]
=== Bare Metal Hardware Provisioning

* Before this update, when installing a dual-stack cluster on bare metal by using installer-provisioned infrastructure, the installation failed because the Virtual Media URL was IPv4 instead of IPv6. As IPv4 was unreachable, the bootstrap failed on the virtual machine (VM) and cluster nodes were not created. With this release, when you install a dual-stack cluster on bare metal for installer-provisioned infrastructure, the dual-stack cluster uses the Virtual Media URL IPv6 and the issue is resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-60240[OCPBUGS-60240])

* Before this update, when installing a cluster with the bare metal as a service (BMaaS) API, an ambiguous validation error was reported. When you set an image URL without a checksum, BMaaS failed to validate the deployment image source information. With this release, when you do not provide a required checksum for an image, a clear message is reported. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-57472[OCPBUGS-57472])

* Before this update, when installing a cluster using bare metal, if cleaning was not disabled, the hardware tried to delete any Software RAID configuration before it ran the `coreos-installer` tool. With this release, the issue is resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-56029[OCPBUGS-56029])

* Before this update, by using a Redfish system ID, such as `redfish://host/redfish/v1/` instead of `redfish://host/redfish/v1/Self`, in a Baseboard Management Console (BMC) URL, a registration error about an invalid JSON was reported. This issue was caused by a bug in the Bare Metal Operator (BMO). With this release, BMO now handles URLs without a Redfish system ID as a valid address without causing a JSON parsing issue. This fix improves the software handling of a missing Redfish system ID in BMC URLs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-55717[OCPBUGS-55717])

* Before this update, virtual media boot attempts sometimes failed because some models of SuperMicro such as `ars-111gl-nhr` used a different virtual media device string than other SuperMicro machines. With this release, an extra conditional check is added to sushy library code to check for the specific model affected and to adjust its behavior. As a result, Supermicro `ars-111gl-nhr` can boot from virtual media. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-55434[OCPBUGS-55434])

* Before this update, RAM Disk logs did not include clear file separators, which occasionally caused the content to overlap on a single line. As a consequence, users could not parse RAM Disk logs. With this release, RAM Disk logs include clear file headers to indicate the boundary between the content of each file. As a result, the readability of RAM Disk logs for users is improved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-55381[OCPBUGS-55381])

* Before this update, during Ironic Python Agent (IPA) deployments, the RAM disk logs in the `metal3-ramdisk-logs` container did not include `NetworkManager` logs. The absence of `NetworkManager` logs hindered effective debugging, which affected network issue resolution. With this release, the existing RAM disk logs in the `metal3-ramdisk-logs` container of a metal3 pod include the entire journal from the host rather than just the `dmesg` and IPA logs. As result, IPA logs provide comprehensive `NetworkManager` data for improved debugging. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-55350[OCPBUGS-55350])

* Before this update, when the provisioning network was disabled in the cluster configuration, you could create a bare-metal host with a driver that required a network boot, for example Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) or Redfish without virtual media. As a result, boot failures occurred during inspection or provisioning because the correct DHCP options could not be identified. With this release, when you create a bare-metal host in this scenario the host fails to register and the reported error references the disabled provisioning network. To create the host, you must enable the provisioning network or use a virtual-media-based driver, for example, Redfish virtual media. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-54965[OCPBUGS-54965])

[id="ocp-release-note-cloud-compute-bug-fixes_{context}"]
=== Cloud Compute

* Before this update, {aws-short} compute machine sets could include a null value for the `userDataSecret` parameter.
Using a null value sometimes caused machines to get stuck in the `Provisioning` state. With this release, the `userDataSecret` parameter requires a value.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-55135[OCPBUGS-55135])

* Before this update, {product-title} clusters on {aws-short} that were created with version 4.13 or earlier could not update to version 4.19.
Clusters that were created with version 4.14 and later have an {aws-short} `cloud-conf` ConfigMap by default, and this ConfigMap is required starting in {product-title} 4.19.
With this release, the Cloud Controller Manager Operator creates a default `cloud-conf` ConfigMap when none is present on the cluster.
This change enables clusters that were created with version 4.13 or earlier to update to version 4.19.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-59251[OCPBUGS-59251])

* Before this update, a `failed to find machine for node ...` appeared in the logs when the `InternalDNS` address for a machine was not set as expected.
As a consequence, the user might interpret this error as the machine not existing.
With this release, the log message reads `failed to find machine with InternalDNS matching ...`.
As a result, the user has a clearer indication of why the match is failing.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-19856[OCPBUGS-19856])

* Before this update, a bug fix altered the availability set configuration by changing the fault domain count to use the maximum available value instead of being fixed at 2.
This inadvertently caused scaling issues for compute machine sets that were created prior to the bug fix, because the controller attempted to modify immutable availability sets.
With this release, availability sets are no longer modified after creation, allowing affected compute machine sets to scale properly.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-56380[OCPBUGS-56380])

* Before this update, compute machine sets migrating from the Cluster API to the Machine API got stuck in the `Migrating` state.
As a consequence, the compute machine set could not finish transitioning to use a different authoritative API or perform further reconciliation of the `MachineSet` object status.
With this release, the migration controllers watch for changes in Cluster API resources and react to authoritative API transitions.
As a result, compute machine sets successfully transition from the Cluster API to the Machine API.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-56487[OCPBUGS-56487])

* Before this update, for the `maxUnhealthy` field in the `MachineHealthCheck` custom resource definition (CRD), it did not document the default value.
With this release, the CRD documents the default value.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-61314[OCPBUGS-61314])

* Before this update, it was possible to specify the use of the `CapacityReservationsOnly` capacity reservation behavior and Spot Instances in the same machine template.
As a consequence, machines with these two incompatible settings were created.
With this release, validation of machine templates ensures that these two incompatible settings do not co-occur.
As a result, machines with these two incompatible settings cannot be created.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-60943[OCPBUGS-60943])

* Before this update, on clusters that support migrating Machine API resources to Cluster API resources, deleting a nonauthoritative machine did not delete the corresponding authoritative machine.
As a consequence, orphaned machines that should have been cleaned up remained on the cluster and could cause a resource leak.
With this release, deleting a nonauthoritative machine triggers propagation of the deletion to the corresponding authoritative machine.
As a result, deletion requests on nonauthoritative machine correctly cascade, preventing orphaned authoritative machines and ensuring consistency in machine cleanup.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-55985[OCPBUGS-55985])

* Before this update, on clusters that support migrating Machine API resources to Cluster API resources, the {cluster-capi-operator} could create an authoritative Cluster API compute machine set in the `Paused` state.
As a consequence, the newly created Cluster API compute machine set could not reconcile or scale machines even though it was using the authoritative API.
With this release, the Operator now ensures that Cluster API compute machine sets are created in an unpaused state when the Cluster API is authoritative.
As a result, newly created Cluster API compute machine sets are reconciled immediately and scaling and machine lifecycle operations proceed as intended when the Cluster API is authoritative.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-56604[OCPBUGS-56604])

* Before this update, scaling large numbers of nodes was slow because scaling requires reconciling each machine several times and each machine was reconciled individually.
With this release, up to ten machines can be reconciled concurrently.
This change improves the processing speed for machines during scaling.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-59376[OCPBUGS-59376])

* Before this update, the {cluster-capi-operator} status controller used an unsorted list of related objects, leading to status updates when there were no functional changes.
As a consequence, users would see significant noise in the {cluster-capi-operator} object and in logs due to continuous and unnecessary status updates.
With this release, the status controller logic sorts the list of related objects before comparing them for changes.
As a result, a status update only occurs when there is a change to the Operator's state.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-56805[OCPBUGS-56805], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-58880[OCPBUGS-58880])

* Before this update, the `config-sync-controller` component of the Cloud Controller Manager Operator did not display logs.
The issue is resolved in this release.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-56508[OCPBUGS-56508])

* Before this update, the Control Plane Machine Set configuration used availability zones from compute machine sets.
This is not a valid configuration.
As a consequence, the Control Plane Machine Set could not be generated when the control plane machines were in a single zone while compute machine sets spanned multiple zones.
With this release, the Control Plane Machine Set derives an availability zone configuration from existing control plane machines.
As a result, the Control Plane Machine Set generates a valid zone configuration that accurately reflects the current control plane machines.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-52448[OCPBUGS-52448])

* Before this update, the controller that annotates a Machine API compute machine set did not check whether the Machine API was authoritative before adding scale-from-zero annotations.
As a consequence, the controller repeatedly added these annotations and caused a loop of continuous changes to the `MachineSet` object.
With this release, the controller checks the value of the `authoritativeAPI` field before adding scale-from-zero annotations.
As a result, the controller avoids the looping behavior by only adding these annotations to a Machine API compute machine set when the Machine API is authoritative.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-57581[OCPBUGS-57581])

* Before this update, the Machine API Operator attempted to reconcile `Machine` resources on platforms other than {aws-short} where the `.status.authoritativeAPI` field was not populated.
As a consequence, compute machines remained in the `Provisioning` state indefinitely and never became operational.
With this release, the Machine API Operator now populates the empty `.status.authoritativeAPI` field with the corresponding value in the machine specification.
A guard is also added to the controllers to handle cases where this field might still be empty.
As a result, `Machine` and `MachineSet` resources are reconciled properly and compute machines no longer remain in the `Provisioning` state indefinitely.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-56849[OCPBUGS-56849])

* Before this update, the Machine API Provider Azure used an old version of the Azure SDK, which used an old API version that did not support referencing a Capacity Reservation group.
As a consequence, creating a Machine API machine that referenced a Capacity Reservation group in another subscription resulted in an Azure API error.
With this release, the Machine API Provider Azure uses a version of the Azure SDK that supports this configuration.
As a result, creating a Machine API machine that references a Capacity Reservation group in another subscription works as expected.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-55372[OCPBUGS-55372])

* Before this update, the two-way synchronization controller on clusters that support migrating Machine API resources to Cluster API resources did not correctly compare the machine specification when converting an authoritative Cluster API machine template to a Machine API machine set.
As a consequence, changes to the Cluster API machine template specification were not synchronized to the Machine API machine set.
With this release, changes to the comparison logic resolve the issue.
As a result, the Machine API machine set synchronizes correctly after the Cluster API machine set references the new Cluster API machine template.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-56010[OCPBUGS-56010])

* Before this update, the two-way synchronization controller on clusters that support migrating Machine API resources to Cluster API resources did not delete the machine template when its corresponding Machine API machine set was deleted.
As a consequence, unneeded Cluster API machine templates persisted in the cluster and cluttered the `openshift-cluster-api` namespace.
With this release, the two-way synchronization controller correctly handles deletion synchronization for the machine template.
As a result, deleting a Machine API authoritative machine set deletes the corresponding Cluster API machine template.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-57195[OCPBUGS-57195])

* Before this update, the two-way synchronization controller on clusters that support migrating Machine API resources to Cluster API resources prematurely reported a successful migration.
As a consequence, if any errors occurred when updating the status of related objects, the operation was not retried.
With this release, the controller ensures that all related object statuses are written before reporting a successful status.
As a result, the controller handles errors during migration better.

[id="ocp-release-note-cloud-credential-operator-bug-fixes_{context}"]
=== Cloud Credential Operator

* Before this update, the `ccoctl` command unnecessarily required the `baseDomainResourceGroupName` parameter when creating the OpenID Connect (OIDC) issuer and managed identities for a private cluster by using {entra-first}. As a consequence, an error displayed when `ccoctl` tried to create private clusters. With this release, the `baseDomainResourceGroupName` parameter is removed as a requirement. As a result, the process for creating a private cluster on {azure-full} is logical and consistent with expectations. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34993[OCPBUGS-34993])

[id="ocp-release-note-cluster-autoscaler-bug-fixes_{context}"]
=== Cluster Autoscaler

* Before this update, the cluster autoscaler attempted to include machine objects that were in a deleting state. As a consequence, the cluster autoscaler count of machines was inaccurate. This issue caused the cluster autoscaler to add additional taints that were not needed. With this release, the autoscaler accurately counts the machines. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-60035[OCPBUGS-60035])

* Before this update, when you created a cluster autoscaler object with the Cluster Autoscaler Operator enabled in the cluster, two `cluster-autoscaler-default` pods in the `openshift-machine-api` were sometimes created at the same time and one of the pods was immediately killed. With this release, only one pod is created. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-57041[OCPBUGS-57041])

* Before this update, the cluster incorrectly switched to the `CustomNoUpgrade` state without the correct `featureGate` configuration. As a consequence, empty `featureGates` and subsequent controller panics occurred. With this release, the `featureGate` configuration for the `CustomNoUpgrade` cluster state matches the default which prevents empty `featureGates` and subsequent controller panics.

* Before this update, some entries on the *Quick Starts* page displayed duplicate link buttons. With this update, the duplicates are removed, and the link buttons are correctly displayed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-60373[OCPBUGS-60373])

* Before this update, the onboarding modal that displayed when you first logged in was missing visuals and images, which made the modal messaging unclear. With this release, the missing elements are added to the modal. As a result, the onboarding experience provides complete visuals consistent with the overall console design. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-57392[OCPBUGS-57392])

* Before this update, importing multiple files in the YAML editor copied the existing content and appended the new file, which created duplicates. With this release, the import behavior is fixed. As a result, the YAML editor displays only the new file content without duplication. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-45297[OCPBUGS-45297])

* Before this update, the preflight custom resource definition (CRD) safety check in {olmv1} blocked updates if it detected changes in the description fields of a CRD. With this update, the preflight CRD safety check does not block updates when there are changes to documentation fields. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-55051[OCPBUGS-55051])

* Before this update, the catalogd and Operator Controller components did not display the correct version and commit information in the {oc-first}. With this update, the correct commit and version information is displayed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-23055[OCPBUGS-23055])

=== Machine Config Operator

* Before this update, an external actor could uncordon a node that the Machine Config Operator (MCO) was draining. As a consequence, the MCO and the scheduler would schedule and unschedule pods at the same time, prolonging the drain process. With this release, the MCO attempts to recordon the node if an external actor uncordons it during the drain process. As a result, the MCO and scheduler no longer schedule and remove pods at the same time. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-61516[OCPBUGS-61516])

* Before this update, during an update from {product-title} 4.18.21 to {product-title} 4.19.6, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) failed due to multiple labels in the `capacity.cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/labels` annotation in one or more machine sets. With this release, the MCO now accepts multiple labels in the `capacity.cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/labels` annotation and no longer fails during the update to {product-title} 4.19.6. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-60119[OCPBUGS-60119])

* Before this update, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) certificate management failed during an Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) upgrade to 4.19 due to missing infrastructure status fields. As a consequence, certificates were refreshed without required Storage Area Network (SAN) IPs, causing connectivity issues for upgraded ARO clusters. With this release, the MCO now adds and retains SAN IPs during certificate management in ARO, preventing immediate rotation on upgrade to 4.19. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-59780[OCPBUGS-59780])

* Before this update, when updating from a version of {product-title} prior to 4.15, the `MachineConfigNode` Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)feature was installed as Technology Preview (TP) causing the update to fail. This feature was fully introduced in {product-title} 4.16. With this release, the update no longer deploys the Technology Preview CRDs, ensuring a successful upgrade. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-59723[OCPBUGS-59723])

* Before this update, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) was updating node boot images without checking whether the current boot image was from {gcp-first} or {aws-first} Marketplace. As a consequence, the MCO would override a marketplace boot image with a standard {product-title} image. With this release, for {aws-short} images, the MCO has a lookup table that has all of the standard {product-title} installer Advanced Metering Infrastructures (AMIs), which it references before updating the boot image. For {gcp-first} images, the MCO checks the URL header before updating the boot image. As a result, the MCO no longer updates machine sets that have a marketplace boot image. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-57426[OCPBUGS-57426])

* Before this update, {product-title} updates that shipped a change to Core DNS templates would restart the `coredns` pod before the image pull for the updated base operating system (OS) image. As a consequence, a race occurred when the operating system update manager failed failed the image pull because of network errors, causing the update to stall. With this release, a retry update operation is added to the Machine Config Operator (MCO) to work around this race condition. https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-43406[OCPBUGS-43406]

=== Networking
* Before this update, an `NMState` service failure occurred in {product-title} deployments because of a `NetworkManager-wait-online` dependency issue in baremetal and multiple network interface controller (NIC) environments. As a consequence, an incorrect network configuration caused deployment failures. With this release, the `NetworkManager-wait-online` dependency for baremetal deployments is updated, which reduces deployment failures and ensures `NMState` service stability. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-61824[OCPBUGS-61824])

* Before this release, the event data was not immediately available when the `cloud-event-proxy` container or pod rebooted. This caused the `getCurrenState` function to incorrectly return a `clockclass` of `0`. With this release, the `getCurrentState` function no longer returns an incorrect `clockclass` and instead returns an HTTP `400 Bad Request` or `404 Not Found Error`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-59969[OCPBUGS-59969])

* Before this update, the `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` object temporarily scaled the `istiod-openshift-gateway` deployment to two replicas. This caused a Continuous Integration (CI) failure because the tests expected one replica. With this release, the `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` object scaling verifies that the `istiod-openshift-gateway` resource has at least one replica to continue deployment. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-59894[OCPBUGS-59894])

* Previously, the DNS Operator did not set the `readOnlyRootFilesystem` parameter to `true` in its configuration or for the configuration of its operands. As a result, the DNS Operator and its operands had `write` access to root file systems. With this release, the DNS Operator now sets the `readOnlyRootFilesystem` parameter to `true`, so that the DNS Operator and its operands now have `read-only` access to root file systems. This update provides enhanced security for your cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-59781[OCPBUGS-59781])

* Before this update, when the Gateway API feature was enabled, it installed an Istio control plane configured with one pod replica and an associated `PodDisruptionBudget` setting. The `PodDisruptionBudget` setting prevented the only pod replica from being evicted, blocking cluster upgrades. With this release, the Ingress Operator prevents the Istio control plane from being configured with the `PodDisruptionBudget` setting. Cluster upgrades are no longer blocked by the pod replica. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-58358[OCPBUGS-58358])

* Before this update, the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) stopped during a cluster upgrade when the `whereabouts-shim` network attachment was enabled. This issue occurred because of a missing `release.openshift.io/version` annotation in the `openshift-multus` namespace. With this release, the missing annotation is now added to the cluster, so that the CNO no longer stops during a cluster upgrade when the `whereabouts-shim` attached is enabled. The cluster upgrade can now continue as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-57643[OCPBUGS-57643])

* Before this update, the Ingress Operator added resources, most noteably gateway resources, to the `status.relatedObjects` parameter of the Cluster Operator even if the CRDs for those resources did not exist. Additionally, the Ingress Operator specified a namespace for the `istios` and `GatewayClass`resources, which are both cluster-scoped resources. As a result of these configurations, the `relatedObjects` parameter contained misleading information. With this release, an update to the status controller of the Ingress Operator ensures that the controller checks if these resources already exist and also checks the related feature gates before adding any of these resources to the `relatedObjects` parameter . The controller no longer specifies namespaces for the `GatewayClass` and `istio` resources. This update ensures that the `relatedObjects` parameter contains accurate information for the `GatewayClass` and `istio` resources. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-57433[OCPBUGS-57433])

* Before this update, a cluster upgrade caused inconsistent egress IP address allocation due to stale Network Address Translation (NAT) handling. This issue occurred only when you deleted an egress IP pod while the OVN-Kubernetes controller for an egress node was down. As a consequence, duplicate Logical Router Policies and egress IP address usage occurred, which caused inconsistent traffic flow and outage. With this release, egress IP address allocation cleanup ensures consistent and reliable egress IP address allocation in {product-title} 4.20 clusters. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-57179[OCPBUGS-57179])

* Previously, when on-premise installer-provisioned infrastructure (IPI) deployments used the Cilium container network interface (CNI), the firewall rule that redirected traffic to the load balancer was ineffective. With this release, the rule works with the Cilium CNI and `OVNKubernetes`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-57065[OCPBUGS-57065])

* Before this update, one of the `keepalived` health check scripts was failing due to missing permissions. This could cause the ingress VIP to be misplaced when shared ingress services were in use. With this release, the necessary permission was added back to the container so the health check now works correctly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-55681[OCPBUGS-55681])

* Before this update, stale IP addresses existed in the `address_set` list of the corresponding DNS rule for the `EgressFirewall` CRD. Instead of being removed, these stale addresses continued to get added to the `address_set`, causing memory leak issues. With this release, when the time-to-live (TTL) expiration for an IP address is reached, the IP address gets removed from the `address_set` list after a 5-second grace period has been reached. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-38735[OCPBUGS-38735])

* Before this update, certain traffic patterns with large packets running between {product-title} nodes and pods triggered an {product-title} host to send Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) needs frag to another {product-title} host. This situation lowered the viable maximum transmission unit (MTU) in the cluster. As a consequence, executing the `ip route show cache` command displayed a cached route with a lower MTU than the physical link. Packets were dropped and {product-title} components were degrading because the host did not send pod-to-pod traffic with the large packets. With this release, the `nftables` rules prevent the {product-title} nodes from lowering their MTU in response to these traffic patterns. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-37733[OCPBUGS-37733])

* Before this update, you could not override the node IP address selection process for deployments that ran on installer-provisioned infrastructure. This limitation impacted user-managed load balancers that did not use VIP addresses on a machine network, and this caused problems in environments that had multiple IP addresses. With this release, deployments that run on installer-provisioned infrastructure now support the `NODEIP_HINT ` parameter for the `nodeip-configuration` systemd service. This support update ensures that the correct node IP address is used, even when the VIP addresses are not on the same subnet. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-36859[OCPBUGS-36859])

[id="ocp-release-note-node-bug-fixes_{context}"]
=== Node

* Before this update, in certain configurations, the kubelet's `podresources` API might have reported memory that was assigned to both active and terminated pods, instead of reporting memory assigned to only active pods. As a consequence, this inaccurate reporting might have affected workload placement by the NUMA-aware scheduler. With this release, kubelet's `podresources` no longer reports resources for terminated pods, which results in accurate workload placement by the NUMA-aware scheduler. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-56785[OCPBUGS-56785])

* Before this release, the Container Runtime Interface-OpenShift (CRI-O) system failed to recognize the terminated state of a stateful set pod when the backend storage went down, causing the pod to remain in a `Terminating` state due to an inability to detect that the container process no longer existed. This caused resource inefficiency and potential service disruption. With this release, the CRI-O now correctly recognizes terminated pods, improving StatefulSet termination flow. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-55485[OCPBUGS-55485])

* Before this update, if a CPU-pinned container within a Guaranteed QoS pod has cgroups quota defined, rounding and small delays in kernel CPU time accounting could cause throttling of the CPU-pinned process, even if the quota is set to allow 100% consumption for each allocated CPU. With this release, when `cpu-manager-policy=static` and the qualifications for static CPU assignment are satisfied, that is containers have Guaranteed QOS with integer CPU requests, the CFS quota is disabled.

=== oc-mirror
* Before this update, the incorrect count of mirrored Helm images in `oc-mirror` caused a failure to note all mirrored Helm images. As a consequence, an incorrect Helm image count was displayed. With this release, the incorrect Helm image count in `oc-mirror` is fixed, and correctly mirrors all Helm images. As a result, the total mirrored images count for Helm charts in `oc-mirror` is accurate. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-59949[OCPBUGS-59949])

* Before this update, the `--parallel-images` flag accepted invalid input, with a minimum value that was less than 1 or greater than the total number of images. As a consequence, parallel image copy failed with 0 or 100 `--parallel-images` flag, and limited the number of images that could be mirrored. With this release, the issue with invalid `--parallel-images` flags is fixed, and values between 1 and the total number of images are accepted. As a result, users can set the `--parallel-images` flag for any value in the valid range. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-58467[OCPBUGS-58467])

* Before this update, high `oc-mirror v2` concurrency defaults caused registry overload and led to request rejections. As a consequence, high concurrency defaults caused registry rejections, and failed container image pushes failed. With this release, concurrency defaults for `oc-mirror v2` are reduced to avoid registry rejections, and the image push success rate is improved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-57370[OCPBUGS-57370])

* Before this update, a bug occurred due to a mismatch between image digests and blocked image tags in the `ImageSetConfig` parameter. This bug caused users to see images from various cloud providers in a mirrored set, although they were blocked. With this release, the `ImageSetConfig` parameter is updated to support regular expression in the `blockedImages` list for more flexible image exclusion, and allows the exclusion of images that match a regular expression pattern in the `blockedImages` list. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-56117[OCPBUGS-56117])

* Before this update, the system umask value was set to `0077` for Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) compliance, and caused the `disk2mirror` parameter to stop uploading {product-title} release images. As a consequence, users could not upload {product-title} release images due to the umask command restriction. With this release, `oc-mirror` handles the faulty umask value and alerts the user. The {product-title} release images are uploaded correctly when the system umask is set to `0077`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-55374[OCPBUGS-55374])

* Before this update, an invalid Helm chart was incorrectly included in an Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) guideline, and caused an error message while running the `m2d`workflow. With this release, the error message for invalid Helm charts in `m2d` workflows is updated, and error message clarity is improved.  (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-54473[OCPBUGS-54473])

* Before this update, multiple release collections occurred due to duplicate channel selection. As a consequence, duplicate release images were collected, and caused unnecessary storage usage. With this release, duplicate release collection is fixed, and each release is collected once. As a result, the duplicate release collection is eliminated, and ensures efficient storage with faster access. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-52562[OCPBUGS-52562])

* Before this update, `oc-mirror` did not check the availability of the specific {product-title} version, and caused it to continue with non-existent versions. As a consequence, users assumed that the mirroring was successful because no error messages were received. With this release, `oc-mirror` returns an error when a non-existent {product-title} version is specified, in addition to a reason for the issue. As a result, users are aware of unavailable versions and can take appropriate action. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-51157[OCPBUGS-51157])

* Before this update, the build controller looked for secrets that were linked for general use, not specifically for the image pull. With this release, when searching for default image pull secrets, the builds use `ImagePullSecrets` that are linked to the service account. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-57918[OCPBUGS-57918])

* Before this update, incorrectly formatted proxy environment variables in Build pod led to build failures due to external binary format complaints. With this release, builds no longer fail due to incorrectly formatted proxy environment variables as they are now excluded. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-54695[OCPBUGS-54695])

* Before this update, bundle unpack jobs did not inherit control plane tolerances for the catalog Operator when they were created. As a result, bundle unpack jobs ran on worker nodes only. If no worker nodes were available due to taints, cluster administrators could not install or update Operators on the cluster. With this release, {olmv0} adopts control plane tolerations for bundle unpack jobs and the jobs can run as part of the control plane. (link://https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-58349[OCPBUGS-58349])

* Before this update, when an Operator supplied more than one API in an Operator group namespace, {olmv0} made unnecessary update calls to the cluster roles that were created for the Operator group. As a result, these unnecessary calls caused churn for ectd and the API server. With this update, {olmv0} does not make unnecessary update calls to the cluster role objects in Operator groups. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-57222[OCPBUGS-57222])

* Before this update, if the `olm-operator` pod crashed during cluster updates due to mislabeled resources, the notification message used the `info` label. With this update, crash notification messages due to mislabeled resources use the `error` label instead. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-53161[OCPBUGS-53161])

* Before this update, the catalog Operator scheduled catalog snapshots for every 5 minutes. On clusters with many namespaces and subscriptions, snapshots failed and cascaded across catalog sources. As a result, the spikes in CPU loads effectively blocked installing and updating Operators. With this update, catalog snapshots are scheduled for every 30 minutes to allow enough time for the snapshotes to resolve. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-43966[OCPBUGS-43966])

[id="ocp-release-known-issues_{context}"]
== Known issues

* There is a known issue with Gateway API and {aws-first}, {gcp-first}, and {azure-first} private clusters. The load balancer that is provisioned for a gateway is always configured to be external, which can cause errors or unexpected behavior:
+
--
** In an {aws-short} private cluster, the load balancer becomes stuck in the `pending` state and reports the error: `Error syncing load balancer: failed to ensure load balancer: could not find any suitable subnets for creating the ELB`.

** In {gcp-short} and {azure-short} private clusters, the load balancer is provisioned with an external IP address, when it should not have an external IP address.
--
+
There is no supported workaround for this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-57440[OCPBUGS-57440])

* When installing a cluster on {azure-short}, if you set any of the `compute.platform.azure.identity.type`, `controlplane.platform.azure.identity.type`, or `platform.azure.defaultMachinePlatform.identity.type` field values to `None`, your cluster is unable to pull images from the Azure Container Registry.
You can avoid this issue by providing a user-assigned identity or by leaving the identity field blank.
In both cases, the installation program generates a user-assigned identity.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-56008[OCPBUGS-56008])

* There is a known issue in the unified software catalog view of the console. When you select *Ecosystem* -> *Software Catalog*, you must enter an existing project name or create a new project to view the software catalog. The project selection field does not effect how catalog content is installed on the cluster. As a workaround, enter any existing project name to view the software catalog. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-61870[OCPBUGS-61870])

[id="ocp-telco-core-release-known-issues_{context}"]

* On systems using specific AMD EPYC processors, some low-level system interrupts, for example `AMD-Vi`, might contain CPUs in the CPU mask that overlaps with CPU-pinned workloads. This behavior is because of the hardware design. These specific error-reporting interrupts are generally inactive and there is currently no known performance impact.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-57787[OCPBUGS-57787])

* Currently, pods that use a `guaranteed` QoS class and request whole CPUs might not restart automatically after a node reboot or kubelet restart. The issue might occur in nodes configured with a static CPU Manager policy and using the `full-pcpus-only` specification, and when most or all CPUs on the node are already allocated by such workloads. As a workaround, manually delete and re-create the affected pods. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-43280[*OCPBUGS-43280*])

* The Performance Profile Creator tool fails to analyze a `must-gather` archive if the archive contains a custom namespace directory that ends with the suffix `nodes`. The failure occurs because of the tool's search logic, which incorrectly reports an error for multiple matches. As a workaround, rename the custom namespace directory so that it does not end with the `nodes` suffix, and run the tool again. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-60218[*OCPBUGS-60218*])

* Currently, on clusters with SR-IOV network virtual functions configured, a race condition might occur between system services responsible for network device renaming and the TuneD service managed by the Node Tuning Operator. As a consequence, the TuneD profile might become degraded after the node restarts, leading to performance degradation. As a workaround, restart the TuneD pod to restore the profile state. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-41934[*OCPBUGS-41934*])

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for {product-title} {product-version} are released as asynchronous errata through the Red{nbsp}Hat Network. All {product-title} {product-version} errata is https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[available on the Red Hat Customer Portal]. See the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} Life Cycle] for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account settings for Red{nbsp}Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications are enabled, users are notified through email whenever new errata relevant to their registered systems are released.

[NOTE]
====
Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming {product-title} entitlements for {product-title} errata notification emails to generate.
====

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of {product-title} {product-version}. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form {product-title} {product-version}.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.

[IMPORTANT]

==== New features and enhancements

////
TODO: Confirm there are no other enhancements going into this z-stream. If there are, might need to introduce this subheading (though it'll look bad so deep with the DLs below)
// [id="ocp-4-20-TODO-direct-auth-ga_{context}"]
// ===== Enabling direct authentication with an external OIDC identity provider (General Availability)

// Using direct authentication with an external OIDC identity provider is now generally available. This authentication method bypasses the built-in OAuth server and uses the external identity provider directly.

// This release also provides the following enhancements to direct authentication.
////

The following enhancements for direct authentication with an external OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider are included in this z-stream release:

General availability of direct authentication with an external OIDC identity provider::
Using direct authentication with an external OIDC identity provider is now generally available. This authentication method bypasses the built-in OAuth server and uses the external identity provider directly.

Support for additional identity providers::
The following OIDC identity providers are now supported for direct authentication:

* Active Directory Federation Services for Windows Server
* GitLab
* Google
* Okta
* Ping Identity
* Red Hat Single Sign-On

Deactivation of OAuth services::
The following internal OAuth resources are now disabled when you configure direct authentication:

* OpenShift OAuth server and OpenShift OAuth API server
* User and group APIs (`*.user.openshift.io`)
* OAuth APIs (`*.oauth.openshift.io`)
* OAuth server and client configurations

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that you do not rely on these removed resources before configuring direct authentication.
====

Support for additional claim mappings::
You can now use the `uid` and `extra` claim mapping fields when configuring an external OIDC provider for direct authentication.

For more information, see xref:../authentication/external-auth.adoc#external-auth[Enabling direct authentication with an external OIDC identity provider].

[id="ocp-4-20-TODO-known-issues_{context}"]
==== Known issues

* When using GitLab or Google as the external OIDC identity provider for direct authentication, clicking *Log out* from the {product-title} web console does not log you out of the console. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-61649[OCPBUGS-61649])
* When using Active Directory Federation Services for Windows Server as the external OIDC identity provider for direct authentication, logging into the {product-title} web console the first time produces an authentication error. As a workaround, reload the web console until it displays properly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-62142[OCPBUGS-62142])
* If you configure direct authentication with an external OIDC provider and do not provide a value for `issuerCertificateAuthority` for the issuer in the OIDC provider configuration, the Machine Config Operator degrades. This can cause the Console Operator to degrade and some control plane nodes may fail to become available. As a workaround, set the `issuerCertificateAuthority` value for the issuer. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-62011[OCPBUGS-62011])
