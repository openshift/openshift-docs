[id="ocp-4-4-about-this-release"]
== About this release

Red Hat {product-title}
(link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2020:0581[RHBA-2020:0581]) is now
available. This release uses link:https://v1-17.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/[Kubernetes 1.17] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to
{product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

Red Hat did not publicly release {product-title} 4.4.0 as the GA version and,
instead, is releasing {product-title} 4.4.3 as the GA version.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at
https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift. The {cloud-redhat-com}
application for {product-title} allows you to deploy OpenShift clusters to
either on-premise or cloud environments.

{product-title} {product-version} is supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 or
later, as well as {op-system-first} 4.4.

You must use {op-system} for the control plane, which are also known as master machines, and
can use either {op-system} or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 or later for
compute machines, which are also known as worker machines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because only Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 7.6 or later is supported for compute
machines, you must not upgrade the Red Hat Enterprise Linux compute machines to
version 8.
====

With the release of {product-title} 4.4, version 4.1 is now end of life. For
more information, see the
link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy].

[id="ocp-4-4-new-features-and-enhancements"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

[id="ocp-4-4-installation-and-upgrade"]
=== Installation and upgrade

[id="ocp-4-4-installing-cluster-on-azure-upi"]
==== Installing a cluster on Microsoft Azure using user-provisioned infrastructure

{product-title} 4.4 introduces support for installing a cluster on Azure using
user-provisioned infrastructure. Running user-provisioned infrastructure on
Azure lets you use customizations your environment might require, like
regulatory, security, and operational control.

You can incorporate example Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates provided by
Red Hat to assist in the deployment process, or create your own. You are also
free to create the required resources through other methods; the ARM templates
are just an example.

See xref:../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-user-infra.adoc#installing-azure-user-infra[Installing a cluster on Azure using ARM templates]
for details.

[id="ocp-4-4-installing-cluster-on-rhv-ipi"]
==== Installing a cluster on Red Hat Virtualization using installer-provisioned infrastructure

{product-title} 4.4 introduces support for installing a cluster in a Red Hat
Virtualization (RHV) environment using installer-provisioned infrastructure.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_rhv/installing-rhv-default.adoc#installing-rhv-default[Installing a cluster quickly on {rh-virtualization}].

[id="ocp-4-4-installing-cluster-on-openstack-upi"]
==== Installing a cluster on OpenStack using user-provisioned infrastructure

{product-title} 4.4 introduces support for installing a cluster on
{rh-openstack-first} that runs on infrastructure that you provide.
Using your own infrastructure allows you to integrate your cluster with existing
infrastructure and modifications. For example, you must create all
{rh-openstack} resources, like Nova servers, Neutron ports, and security groups.
Red Hat provides Ansible playbooks to help you with the deployment process.

You can also install a cluster on {rh-openstack} with Kuryr using your own
infrastructure.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_openstack/installing-openstack-user.adoc#installing-openstack-user[Installing a cluster on OpenStack on your own infrastructure] or
xref:../installing/installing_openstack/installing-openstack-user-kuryr.adoc#installing-openstack-user-kuryr[Installing a cluster on OpenStack with Kuryr on your own infrastructure].

[id="ocp-4-4-installing-cluster-on-openstack-no-longer-requires-swift-storage-service"]
==== Installing a cluster on OpenStack no longer requires the Swift object storage service

Beginning with version 4.4, {product-title} no longer requires that the Swift
object storage service be present on the {rh-openstack} cloud where it is
installed. If Swift is not available for the {product-title} installation, the
installer uses the Cinder block storage and Glance image registry services in
its place.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_openstack/installing-openstack-user.adoc#installing-openstack-user[Installing a cluster on OpenStack using your own infrastructure].

[id="ocp-4-4-clusters-installed-on-openstack-support-self-signed-certs"]
==== Clusters installed on OpenStack support self-signed certificates

{product-title} 4.4 can now be installed on {rh-openstack} clouds that use
self-signed certificates for authorization.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_openstack/installing-openstack-user.adoc#installing-openstack-user[Installing a cluster on OpenStack using your own infrastructure].

[id="ocp-4-4-openstack-validates-rhcos-images-checksum"]
==== OpenStack validates {op-system} images by checking sha256 checksum

On {rh-openstack}, the installer now performs automatic checksum validation of
{op-system-first} images.

[id="ocp-4-4-support-for-east-west-traffic-with-ovn-on-openstack-kuryr"]
==== Support for east-west traffic with OVN load balancing on OpenStack with Kuryr

{product-title} installations that use Kuryr on {rh-openstack} 16 can now use
the OVN load-balancing provider driver instead of the Amphora driver. If OVN and
the OVN Octavia driver are present in the environment, OVN is used
automatically. As a result, load balancer performance and resource utilization
are improved. The need for a load balancer VM for each service is also removed.

[id="ocp-4-4-using-upgrade-channels"]
==== Using upgrade channels for 4.4 release

Upgrades from the latest {product-title} 4.3.z release to 4.4 will be available
at GA for clusters that have switched to the fast-4.4 channel. Telemetry data
from early adopters in the fast-4.4 channel will be monitored to inform when the
upgrade is promoted into the stable-4.4 channel. This monitoring is above and
beyond our extensive enterprise-grade testing and may take several weeks.

[id="ocp-4-4-security"]
=== Security

[id="ocp-4-4-bound-service-account-tokens"]
==== Support for bound service account tokens

{product-title} 4.4 provides support for bound service account tokens, which improves the ability to integrate with cloud provider identity access management (IAM) services, such as AWS IAM.

For more information, see xref:../authentication/bound-service-account-tokens.adoc#bound-service-account-tokens[Using bound service account tokens].

[id="ocp-4-4-oauth-proxy-imagestream"]
==== The `oauth-proxy` imagestream is now available

{product-title} 4.4 introduces the `oauth-proxy` imagestream for third party authentication integration. You should no longer use the `oauth-proxy` image from the Red Hat Registry. You should instead use the `openshift/oauth-proxy:v4.4` imagestream if you target {product-title} 4.4 clusters and newer. This guarantees backwards compatibility and allows you to add imagestream triggers to get critical fixes. The `v4.4` tag will be available for at least the next three {product-title} minor releases without breaking changes. Each minor release will also introduce its own tag.

[id="ocp-4-4-kube-apiserver-check-certs-before-tokens"]
==== kube-apiserver checks client certificates before tokens

In previous versions of {product-title}, the kube-apiserver checked tokens
before client certificates for authentication. Now kube-apiserver checks client
certificates before tokens.

For example, if you had a `system:admin` kubeconfig and ran the `oc --token=foo get pod`
command in previous versions of {product-title}, it would authenticate as a user
with token `foo`. Now it authenticates as `system:admin`. The recommendation for
past releases was to impersonate a user with the parameter `--as` in such cases
instead of overriding the token when using a client certificate; this is no
longer necessary.

[id="ocp-4-4-nodes"]
=== Nodes

[id="ocp-4-4-evicting-pods-using-descheduler-tp"]
==== Evicting Pods using the descheduler (Technology Preview)

The descheduler provides the ability to evict a running Pod so that the Pod can
be rescheduled onto a more suitable node.

You can benefit from descheduling Pods in situations such as the following:

* Nodes are underutilized or overutilized.
* Pod and node affinity requirements, such as taints or labels, have changed and
the original scheduling decisions are no longer appropriate for certain nodes.
* Node failure requires Pods to be moved.
* New nodes are added to clusters.

See xref:../nodes/scheduling/nodes-descheduler.adoc#nodes-descheduler[Evicting Pods using the descheduler]
for more information.

[id="ocp-4-4-controlling-overcommit-and-managing-container-density-on-nodes"]
==== Controlling overcommit and managing container density on nodes

{product-title} administrators can now control the level of overcommit and
manage container density on nodes. You can configure cluster-level overcommit
using the Cluster Resource Override Operator to override the ratio between
requests and limits set on developer containers.

For more information, see xref:../nodes/clusters/nodes-cluster-overcommit.adoc#nodes-cluster-resource-override_nodes-cluster-overcommit[Configuring your cluster to place Pods on overcommitted nodes].

[id="ocp-4-4-cluster-monitoring"]
=== Cluster monitoring

[id="ocp-4-4-monitoring-dashboards-in-web-console"]
==== Monitoring Dashboards in web console

The Dashboards view is now available from the Monitoring section in the web
console. This lets you view metrics that bring transparency to the
{product-title} cluster and its dependent components.

[id="ocp-4-4-hwmon-collector-disabled"]
==== hwmon collector disabled in node-exporter

The `hwmon` collector has been disabled in the node-exporter monitoring
component because it is no longer used to collect cluster metrics.

[id="ocp-4-4-cluster-reader-can-read-node-metrics"]
==== cluster-reader can read node metrics

The `cluster-reader` role can now read node metrics by default.

[id="ocp-4-4-new-cluster-alert"]
==== Cluster alert for when multiple containers are killed

You are notified with a `MultipleContainersOOMKilled` alert when multiple
containers are killed within 15 minutes due to memory outages.

[id="ocp-4-4-new-api-server-alerts"]
==== New API server alerts

There are two new API server alerts available for {product-title} 4.4:

* `ErrorBudgetBurn`: fires when the API server issues 5xx request responses.
* `AggregatedAPIErrors`: fires when the number of errors have increased for the
aggregated API servers.

[id="ocp-4-4-permission-updates-for-po"]
==== Permission updates for Prometheus Operator

The custom resource definitions managed by the Prometheus Operator now have more
restrictive permissions.

The custom resources the Prometheus Operator manages include:

* `Prometheus`
* `ServiceMonitor`
* `PodMonitor`
* `Alertmanager`
* `PrometheusRule`

[id="ocp-4-4-cluster-monitoring-version-updates"]
==== Cluster monitoring component version updates

The following monitoring components have been upgraded:

* Prometheus: version upgrade from 2.14.0 to 2.15.2
* Alertmanager: version upgrade from 0.19.0 to 0.20.0
* Prometheus Operator: version upgrade from 0.34.0 to 0.35.1

[id="ocp-4-4-sctp-on-ocp"]
==== Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) on {product-title}

SCTP is a reliable message based protocol that runs on top of an IP network.
When enabled, you can use SCTP as a protocol with both Pods and Services.
For more information, see xref:../networking/using-sctp.adoc#using-sctp[Using SCTP].

[id="ocp-4-4-using-dns-forwarding"]
==== Using DNS forwarding

You can use DNS forwarding to override the forwarding default configuration on a
per-zone basis by specifying which name server should be used for a given zone.

For more information, see
xref:../networking/dns-operator.adoc#dns-operator[Using DNS forwarding].

[id="ocp-4-4-haproxy-upgraded-to-version-2"]
==== HAProxy upgraded to version 2.0

The HAProxy used for Ingress has been upgraded from version 1.8.17 to 2.0.13.
This upgrade introduces no new APIs or supported user-facing capabilities to
{product-title}. The upgrade does provide significant performance improvements
and many bug fixes. HAProxy 2.0 also adds native Prometheus metrics and provides
full IPv6 support when other {product-title} components are configured to
support it.

[id="ocp-4-4-ingress-enhancements"]
==== Ingress Enhancements

There are two noteworthy Ingress enhancements introduced in {product-title} 4.4:

* xref:../networking/routes/route-configuration.adoc#nw-route-admission-policy_route-configuration[Ingress gains a Route admission policy API]:
allows you to run applications in multiple namespaces with the same domain name.
* xref:../networking/ingress-operator.adoc#nw-ingress-controller-endpoint-publishing-strategies_configuring-ingress[Ingress can be exposed by a NodePort service]:
facilitates integration of your existing load balancer so that you can have
granular control over your load balancing solution.

[id="ocp-4-4-storage"]
=== Storage

[id="ocp-4-4-persistent-storage-csi-snapshots"]
==== Persistent storage using CSI snapshots (Technology Preview)

You can now use the Container Storage Interface (CSI) to create, restore, and delete a volume snapshot. This feature is enabled by default in Technology Preview.

For more information, see xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-snapshots.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-snapshots[Using CSI volume snapshots].

[id="ocp-4-4-persistent-storage-csi-cloning"]

[id="ocp-4-4-developer-experience"]
=== Developer experience

[id="ocp-4-4-automatic-image-pruning"]
==== Automatic image pruning

You can now enable automatic image pruning. This is not enabled by default;
you will be notified of this option after installing or upgrading to
{product-title} 4.4. This automation is managed by the Image Registry Operator, which
creates a CronJob to run periodic image pruning.

[id="ocp-4-4-build-objects-report-conditions-in-status"]
==== Build objects report conditions in status

Build conditions have been added for each existing {product-title} build phase.
These conditions contain information about the build during its build lifecycle.
You can also use commands like `oc wait` to wait for a specific build phase to
be reached.

[id="ocp-4-4-recreate-rollouts-for-image-registry"]
==== Recreate rollouts for image registry

You can now use the `Recreate` rollout strategy when deploying the image
registry. This lets you use `ReadWriteOnce` persistent volumes, such as AWS
Elastic Block Store. When using these storage types, you must use the `Recreate`
rollout strategy to successfully upgrade an {product-title} cluster.

[id="ocp-4-4-odo"]
==== odo enhancements

`odo` has several enhancements and improvements that focus on the user experience:

*  An `odo debug info` command is now available.
*  The `odo url` command now has a `--secure` flag to specify HTTPS URLs.
* The `odo create`, `odo url`, and `odo config` commands now have a `--now` flag to apply changes on the cluster immediately.
* The `odo debug port-forward` command now selects a port automatically if the default port is occupied.
* The output of the `odo storage` and `odo push` commands is restructured for better readability.
* Experimental mode is now available, in which you may use Technology Preview features, such as creating applications using devfiles.
* Technology Preview feature - support of devfiles is now available. To learn more, see the xref:../cli_reference/developer_cli_odo/odo-release-notes.adoc#odo-notable-improvements_odo-release-notes[odo Release Notes].

[id="ocp-4-4-openshift-pipelines-tp"]
==== OpenShift Pipelines (Technology Preview)
OpenShift Pipelines use Tekton Custom Resources (CR) to create extensible CI/CD solutions for automating deployments. These CRs serve as the building blocks to assemble the Pipeline. OpenShift Pipelines provide a catalog of reusable Tasks that can be used to easily build Pipelines. Each Pipeline runs in an isolated container without requiring the maintenance of a CI server and is portable across multiple platforms.
//To learn more, see <TBD link to docs>OpenShift Pipelines Release Notes.

[id="ocp-4-4-helm-3-ga-support"]
==== Helm 3 GA support

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes and {product-title} applications. It
uses a packaging format called Helm charts to simplify defining, installing, and
upgrading of applications and Services.

Helm CLI is built and shipped with {product-title} and is available to download
from the web console's CLI menu.

[id="ocp-4-4-operators"]
=== Operators

[id="ocp-4-4-etcd-cluster-operator"]
==== etcd cluster Operator

{product-title} 4.4 introduces the etcd cluster Operator, which handles the scaling of etcd and provisioning etcd dependencies such as TLS certificates. The etcd cluster Operator simplifies the disaster recovery procedure to restore to a previous cluster state, automates the addition of etcd members, provides more accurate etcd member health reporting, and reports events to assist with debugging the etcd cluster.

With this update, the names of the following disaster recovery scripts were changed:

* `etcd-snapshot-backup.sh` is now `cluster-backup.sh`.
* `etcd-snapshot-restore.sh` is now `cluster-restore.sh`.

For more information, see xref:../backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/about-disaster-recovery.adoc#about-dr[About disaster recovery].

[id="ocp-4-4-insights-operator-anonymized-csr"]
==== Insights Operator now collects anonymized CSRs

With this enhancement, the Insights Operator periodically collects anonymized
certificate signing requests (CSR) to identify CSRs that are not verified in
Kubernetes or have not been approved. Additionally, the Insights Operator collects
data if certificates are valid. As a result, this helps improve the {product-title}
customer support experience.

[id="ocp-4-4-remove-samples-operator-when-unable-to-connect"]
==== Remove Samples Operator if it cannot connect to registry.redhat.io

Sample imagestreams are not created if the Samples Operator cannot connect to
`registry.redhat.io` during installation. This ensures that sample content
installation does not fail {product-title} cluster installation.

You can xref:../openshift_images/samples-operator-alt-registry.adoc#installation-restricted-network-samples_samples-operator-alt-registry[configure alternate or mirrored registries]
to bypass this issue if it arises during your cluster installation.

[id="ocp-4-4-documentation-conventions"]
=== Documentation updates and conventions

== Notable technical changes

{product-title} 4.4 introduces the following notable technical changes.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-4-sending-cluster-logs-using-fluent-syslog-plug-in"]
==== Sending cluster logs using the Fluentd syslog plug-in (RFC 3164)

Due to changes introduced with the Log Forwarding feature in {product-title}
4.3, you could no longer use the Fluentd syslog plug-in to forward logs to an
external syslog server. In {product-title} 4.4, this functionality is restored
and you can use the syslog plug-in. The procedure to configure the plug-in is
different in {product-title} version 4.4 than it was in version 4.2. For more
information, see
xref:../logging/config/cluster-logging-external.adoc#cluster-logging-collector-syslog_cluster-logging-external[Sending logs using the Fluentd syslog plug-in (RFC 3164)].

The `machineCIDR` network parameter used in the `install-config.yaml` file is
now deprecated. You should use `machineNetwork.cidr` instead.

[id="ocp-4-4-service-catalog-deprecated"]
==== Service Catalog, Template Service Broker, Ansible Service Broker, and their Operators

[NOTE]
====
Service Catalog is not installed by default in {product-title} 4.
====

Service Catalog, Template Service Broker, Ansible Service Broker, and their
associated Operators were deprecated starting in {product-title} 4.2.

Ansible Service Broker, the Ansible Service Broker Operator, and the following
APBs are now removed in {product-title} 4.4:

* APB base image
* APB tools container
* PostgreSQL APB
* MySQL APB
* MariaDB APB

The following related APIs have also been removed:

* `.automationbroker.io/v1alpha1`
* `.osb.openshift.io/v1`

Service Catalog and Template Service Broker will be removed in a future
{product-title} release, as well as the following related API:

* `.servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1beta1`

If they are enabled in 4.4, the web console warns cluster administrators that
these features are still enabled. The following alerts can be viewed from the
*Monitoring* -> *Alerting* page and have a *Warning* severity:

* `ServiceCatalogAPIServerEnabled`
* `ServiceCatalogControllerManagerEnabled`
* `TemplateServiceBrokerEnabled`

The `service-catalog-controller-manager` and `service-catalog-apiserver` cluster
Operators are also now set to `Upgradeable=false` in 4.4. This means that they
will block future cluster upgrades to the next minor version, for example 4.5,
if they are still installed at that time. Upgrading to z-stream releases such as
4.4.z, however, are still permitted in this state.

If Service Catalog is installed, cluster administrators can see
xref:../applications/service_brokers/uninstalling-service-catalog.adoc#sb-uninstalling-service-catalog[Uninstalling Service Catalog]
to uninstall it before the next minor version of {product-title} is released.

[id="ocp-4-4-deprecation-of-operatorsources"]

The Operator Framework's current packaging format, the _Package Manifest Format_,
is also deprecated in this release, to be replaced by the new _Bundle Format_ in a
future release. As a result, the `oc adm catalog build` command, which builds
catalogs in the Package Manifest Format, is also deprecated.

For more information on the upcoming Bundle Format and Operator
Package Manager CLI (`opm`), see the link:https://docs.okd.io/latest/operators/understanding_olm/olm-understanding-olm.html#olm-new-bundle-opm_olm-understanding-olm[upstream OKD documentation].

===== Converting custom OperatorSources and CatalogSourceConfigs

If there are any custom OperatorSources or CatalogSourceConfigs objects present
on the cluster in {product-title} 4.4, the `marketplace` cluster Operator now
sets an `Upgradeable=false` condition and issues a *Warning* alert. This means
that it will block future cluster upgrades to the next minor version, for
example 4.5, if they are still installed at that time. Upgrades to z-stream
releases such as 4.4.z, however, are still permitted in this state.

Cluster administrators can convert custom OperatorSources or
CatalogSourceConfigs to using CatalogSources directly to clear this alert:

.Procedure

. Remove your custom OperatorSources or CatalogSourceConfigs objects.

.. Search for OperatorSources or CatalogSourceConfigs objects across all
namespaces:
+
----
$ oc get opsrc --all-namespaces
$ oc get csc --all-namespaces
----

.. Remove all custom objects from all relevant namespaces:
+
----
$ oc delete opsrc <custom_opsrc_name> -n <namespace>
$ oc delete csc <custom_csc_name> -n <namespace>
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not remove the default OperatorSources in the `openshift-marketplace`
namespace: `redhat-operators`, `community-operators`, `certified-operators`, and
`redhat-marketplace`. They are bootstrapped if accidentally removed, however.
====

. Use the procedure as described in
xref:../operators/olm-restricted-networks.adoc#olm-building-operator-catalog-image_olm-restricted-networks[Building an Operator catalog image]
from the restricted network documentation to create and push a new catalog
image, making the following changes at the `oc adm catalog build` command step:
+
--
* Change `--appregistry-org` to your namespace on the App Registry instance, for
example on link:https://quay.io[Quay.io].
* Change `--to` to your image repository tag, which is applied to the built
catalog image and pushed.
--
+
For example:
+
----
$ oc adm catalog build \
    --appregistry-org <namespace> \
    --from=registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-operator-registry:v4.4 \
    --to=quay.io/<namespace>/<catalog_name>:<tag> \
    [-a ${REG_CREDS}]
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `oc adm catalog build` command is deprecated; however, deprecated features
are still supported.
====

. Apply a CatalogSource to your cluster that references your new catalog image:
+
----
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -

apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: my-operator-catalog
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  sourceType: grpc
  image: quay.io/<namespace>/<catalog_name>:<tag> <1>
  displayName: My Operator Catalog
  updateStrategy:
    registryPoll: <2>
      interval: 30m
EOF
----
<1> Specify your custom Operator catalog image.
<2> CatalogSources can now automatically check for new versions to keep up to date.

[id="ocp-4-4-high-granularity-request-duration-buckets"]
==== High granularity request duration buckets in Prometheus

High granularity request duration buckets were dropped in Prometheus, which
were tracked with the `apiserver_request_duration_seconds_bucket` metric. This
leaves enough buckets for meaningful alerting from other monitoring components,
but drastically reduces cardinality.

[id="ocp-4-4-bug-fixes"]
== Bug fixes

*apiserver-auth*

* Previously, if a user attempted to log in from the CLI when only browser-based
login was configured, they were prompted for a username and password. Now, if a
user attempts to log in from the CLI when only browser-based login is
configured, a message is shown that instructs users how to retrieve the login
token. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1671604[*BZ#1671604*])

* Previously, due to a race condition, it went unnoticed when the mounted
serving certificate changed or appeared, so the serving certificate was not
trusted by metrics scrapers on the HTTPS endpoint. The race condition was
removed and Operators based on library-go are now able to reload the serving
certificate correctly.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1779438[*BZ#1779438*])

* Previously, the Kubernetes API server service network address was not handled
properly if an IPv6 address was used. The OAuth proxy can now properly connect
to the Kubernetes API server if it serves on an IPv6 address.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1789462[*BZ#1789462*])

*Build*

* Before starting a build, the OpenShift builder would parse the supplied
Dockerfile and reconstruct a modified version of it to use for the build, to add
labels and handle substitutions of the images named in `FROM` instructions. The
generated Dockerfile did not always correctly reconstruct `ENV` and `LABEL`
instructions. The generated Dockerfile would sometimes include `=` characters
where the original did not, and the build would fail with a syntax error. With
this bug fix, when generating the modified Dockerfile, the original text for
`ENV` and `LABEL` instructions is now used verbatim. As a result, the build
process no longer introduces syntax errors in `ENV` and `LABEL` instructions.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821860[*BZ#1821860*])

* The JenkinsPipeline build strategy is deprecated as of {product-title} 4.3.0.
Use Jenkinsfiles directly on Jenkins or OpenShift Pipelines instead.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1804976[*BZ#1804976*])

* Build label generation and validation was not fully conforming to Kubernetes
expectations. Builds could fail with certain BuildConfig names with invalid
label errors. This bug fix updates the build controller and build API server to
now use complete Kubernetes validation routines to ensure any added build labels
will meet Kubernetes label criteria. As a result, builds with any valid
BuildConfig name will not fail because of invalid build label values.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1804934[*BZ#1804934*])

* Previously, if the Samples Operator’s `samplesRegistry` field was changed and
it still led to an imagestream import error, it appeared that the Samples
Operator did not take the configuration change when viewing the imagestream
status. Now, if a change to the Samples Operator’s `samplesRegistry` field still
leads to an imagestream import error, the new failure reasons now properly
appear in the imagestream status.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1795705[*BZ#1795705*])

* Previously, after a `RUN` instruction, the OpenShift builder attempted to
unmount each of the bind mounts that were created, and logged any errors that
were encountered in the process. The builder now only unmounts the top-level
directory, and has the kernel unmount the bind mounts. The errors are no longer
encountered and therefore no longer reported.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1772179[*BZ#1772179*])

* Previously, setting both `incremental` and `forcePull` flags to `true` on a
build strategy could result in builds using push image credentials to pull
images. As a result, image pulls from private registries would fail. Now, the
build image properly manages registry push and pull credentials when both
`incremental` and `forcePull` are set to `true`.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1774492[*BZ#1774492*])

* The command `oc new-build` did not have the same `--insecure-registries` flag
available with the `oc new-app` command to allow for the sure of insecure image
reference URLs as their source. As a result, `oc new-build` invocations would
receive errors when attempting to make HTTPS connections using HTTP-based image
references were supplied as the base image for the build. Now, The
`--insecure-registries` option has been added to the `oc new-build` command and
users can now create builds that reference insecure registries as their base
image. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1780714[*BZ#1780714*])

*Cloud Credential Operator*

* The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) would report on CredentialsRequests with
conditions even when the CCO has been disabled. Alerts would show even when the
Operator has been configured to be disabled. With this bug fix, conditions are
no longer reported when the CCO is set to disabled.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1794536[*BZ#1794536*])

* Reconciling a CredentialsRequest would attempt to create a role assignment
that already exists, and Microsoft Azure logs would show `create role
assignment` errors. This bug fix checks for existing role assignments to avoid
creating one that already exists. As a result, there are less error messages in
Azure logs.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1776079[*BZ#1776079*])

*Console Kubevirt Plugin*

* When selecting a VM template without annotations, the VM wizard closed
unexpectedly. The VM wizard now works with templates that do not have any
annotations.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1776190[*BZ#1776190*])

* Previously, when creating a VM template that uses a URL as a disk image
source, a persistent volume claim (PVC) was not created for VMs created when
using the template. Now when creating a new VM from such a template, the PVC is
cloned and used for the disk image.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1779116[*BZ#1779116*])

* Previously, different units were used when interpreting values for memory and
storage in a template, causing requests to create a VM to fail on some
occasions. The value for memory and storage in a VM template now use Gi units
consistently.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1792101[*BZ#1792101*])

* Previously, the VM wizard ignored any disk configuration in a VM template. The
VM wizard now uses the disk configuration if specified in a template.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1782434[*BZ#1782434*])

* The UI previously reported that failed VM migrations had succeeded. When
migrating a VM, the UI now correctly reports when a VM migration fails.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1785344[*BZ#1785344*])

* Previously, if a VM had multiple CD-ROM drives defined, it was not possible to
remove each CD-ROM drive without saving, and then reopening the dialog for each
CD-ROM. Now multiple CD-ROM drives can be removed without saving and reopening
the dialog.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1786070[*BZ#1786070*])

* Previously, it was not possible to create a VM with the default YAML used by
the VM wizard because the YAML was invalid. It is now possible to use the
default VM template when creating a VM with the wizard.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1808304[*BZ#1808304*])

* Previously, it was not possible to modify the boot order by using the visual
editor because the boot order in the template YAML was unrecognized. It is now
possible to modify the boot order when using the visual editor.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1789269[*BZ#1789269*])

*Image*

* The `oc tag` command did not update ImageStreams when ImageStreamTags are
inaccessible. The command would report that the new tag was created, but it was
not. This bug fix updates the `oc tag` command so that it actually creates the
tag even if there are no permissions for the ImageStreamTagAPI.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1746149[*BZ#1746149*])

* To detect whether base64 was padded or unpadded, the decoder was relying on
the string length. This made the decoder unable to handle pull secrets that
contain whitespaces. This bug fix checks if the string has trailing padding
symbols instead. As a result, pull secrets with whitespaces can be used to pull
images. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1776599[*BZ#1776599*])

*Image Registry*

* Previously, the Image Registry Operator did not report a new version if it was
in the unmanaged state, which blocked upgrades. With this bug fix the Image
Registry Operator now reports the accurate version when it is the unmanaged
state, which results in successful upgrades.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1791934[*BZ#1791934*])

* Previously, the `nodeca` daemonset did not tolerate `NoSchedule` taints, which
caused missing pods on nodes. This bug fix adds toleration so tainted node
receive updates from the `nodeca` daemonset.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1785115[*BZ#1785115*]

* The Image Registry Operator was using a rolling update strategy that was not
compatible with RWO volumes, which meant that RWO volumes could not be used.
This bug fix allows the Image Registry Operator to pick up the rolling update
strategy, and can now be deployed with RWO volumes in non-high-available
configurations (i.e., configurations with only one replica).
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1798759[*BZ#1798759*])

* Previously, the Image Registry Operator did not clean up the storage status
when it was removing storage. When the registry was switched back to the
`Managed` state, it was not able to detect that storage needed to be
bootstrapped. With this bug fix the Image Registry Operator cleans up the
storage status, allowing the Operator to create storage when it is switched back
to the `Managed` state.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1787488[*BZ#1787488*])

*Installer*

* Earlier versions of clusters that you provisioned on AWS with
installer-provisioned infrastructure do not include security group rules that
allow traffic from control plane hosts to workers on TCP and UDP ports
30000-32767. Because of this, new OVN Networking components cannot work as
intended. Now, the required security group rules will be added to these clusters
to allow communication between control plane and worker machines on TCP and UDP
ports 30000-32767, and OVN Networking components work as intended.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1763936[*BZ#1763936*])

* Previously, the upgrade process on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) nodes was
blocked. An unnecessary machine config apply step failed when it could not pull
images from behind the proxy. The unnecessary step was removed, and upgrades to
RHEL nodes behind a proxy can succeed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1786297[*BZ#1786297*])

* Previously, when you upgraded RHEL 7 nodes from version 4.2.12, the machine
config was not properly updated by the MCO. Because package installs updated
files on the local disk, the MCO did not process config updates on RHEL nodes.
Now, the machine config apply step has been restored, and the image pull process
can complete behind a proxy. Machine configs are correctly applied after package
updates, and upgrades on RHEL 7 nodes succeed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1792139[*BZ#1792139*])

*kube-apiserver*

* Although metrics for metrics for aggregated API server status existed, alerts
for them did not. Now, an error displays when an aggregated API reports too many
errors in a short period of time because that indicates that the availability of
the services changes too often.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1772564[*BZ#1772564*])

*kube-controller-manager*

* Previously, certificates were not propagated correctly, so the cloud provider
was unable to initialize behind a man-in-the-middle proxy. Now, the certificates are
correctly propagated to the kube-controller-manager, and the cloud provider
works as expected with a man-in-the-middle proxy.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1772756[*BZ#1772756*])

*Logging*

* Previously, you could use Fluentd plug-ins to forward logs to external systems
using syslog protocol (RFC 3164). The Log Forwarding API added to {product-title}
4.3 changed the process for configuring log forwarding using syslog. As a
result, you could not forward logs using the same method as in {product-title}
4.2.  To address this change, a new process was devised to allow log forwarding
using the syslog protocol. This change was backported to {product-title} 4.3.7.
As a result, you can continue to forward logs to an external syslog server.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1799024[*BZ#1799024*])

*Machine Config Operator*

* Because some applications are sensitive to HAProxy timeout values, such as
Kuryr, 24 hour timeout values were used for the API LB. If an HAProxy reload
operation was triggered many times in a short period, it was possible for many
HAProxy processes to accumulate. This bug fix forces sending `SIGTERM` after a
default timeout of 120 seconds to old HAProxy processes which have not yet
terminated. As a result, the number of long lived duplicate HAProxy processes is
reduced.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1771566[*BZ#1771566*])

*Metering Operator*

* Metering does not manage or delete any S3 bucket data. When deleting a report,
any S3 buckets used to store metering data must be manually cleaned up. If
reporting data stored in an S3 bucket is not manually cleaned up and the same
report is re-created, the original reporting data will still exist and will
cause duplicate row entries.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1728350[*BZ#1728350*])

*Monitoring*

* Because the OAuth proxy container readiness probe was misconfigured, the
container logs were flooded by error messages every 10 seconds. The readiness
probe has been configured with the proper settings. As a result, the error
messages are not appearing in the logs.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1658899[*BZ#1658899*])

* Because the `cluster-reader` role does not have the permission to view node or
Pod metrics, users bound to that role could not access metrics using commands
such as `oc top node`.  The `cluster-reader` role has been updated to include
permissions to allow viewing metrics.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1723662[*BZ#1723662*])

* A new experimental Prometheus user interface was introduced upstream. The new
experimental interface that was not fully tested and not stable. As a result,
switching from the experimental interface to the default interface returned an
empty page.  To prevent this issue, the link to the experimental UI has been
hidden. As a result, it is no longer possible to access the experimental
Prometheus interface.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1781415[*BZ#1781415*])

* {product-title} was evaluating some recording rules incorrectly, As a result,
the metrics generated from the recording rules are missing. The recording rules
have been fixed. All recording rules now evaluate successfully.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1807843[*BZ#1807843*],
link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1779324[*BZ#1779324*])

*Networking*

* A previous Egress IP bug fix did not fully clean up after removed Egress IPs
resulting in the possibility that harmless extra iptables rules could be left
behind on a node. With this bug fix, the extra rules are now removed if they are
no longer being used.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1787488[*BZ#1787488*])

* Previously, using the httpProxy or httpsProxy hostname with uppercase letters
makes the CNO fatal, which is a violation of RFC 3986. As a result, CNO was
not operational. This bug fix parses it with golangs `url.ParseRequestURI`,
which implemented RFC 3986 correctly and a few more RFCs. As a result, capital
case is now allowed in httpProxy and httpsProxy.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1802606[*BZ#1802606*])

* Previously, the Kubeconfig used by the kubelet, which is used on the SDN,
changed its path causing SDN to have a null deference trying to parse the empty
file. This bug fix made SDN able to handle both old and new paths.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1781707[*BZ#1781707*])

*Node*

* Previously, no alerts were issued when kubelet certificates expired. This
caused kubelets to stop working without administrators realizing it. This fix
adds a `server_expiration_renew_errors` metric to report expired certificates.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1767523[*BZ#1767523*])

* Conmon was timing out on kubelet exec liveness probes. This caused some exec
probes to fail, forcing the container to be killed and restarted. The exec
liveness probes now work as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1817568[*BZ#1817568*])

* On node reboot, CRI-O was not cleaning up IP addresses correctly when Pods
could not be restored. This led to node IP exhaustion, causing Pods to not
start. Now if a Pod cannot be restored after restart, the Pod network is
destroyed, releasing the IP addresses for future use.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1781824[*BZ#1781824*])

* RHEL 7 could not be added to an {product-title} cluster because CRI-O would
not start. This was caused by a Conmon package issue. This bux fixes Conmon and
RHEL 7 can now join an {product-title} cluster.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1809906[*BZ#1809906*])

* The horizontal Pod autoscaler (HPA) was not receiving metrics from exited init
containers. This is fixed by submitting zero-based metrics for exited init
containers, allowing the HPA to perform analysis on Pods with an init container.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1814283[*BZ#1814283*])

* The kubelet metrics endpoint was periodically returning a 500 status code,
which prevented Prometheus from gathering metrics for the kubelet endpoint and
node. The 500 code was caused by dead containers mixing into the metrics stream,
causing duplicate metrics to be injected. This bug is fixed and metrics are now
correctly reported from the kubelet.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1748073[*BZ#1748073*])

*oc*

* The `oc logs` command was returning errors for some resources due to OpenShift
CLI's internal code not accounting for new versions of APIs. OpenShift CLI now
supports all known API types and versions, allowing `oc logs` to work for all
resources. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1774366[*BZ#1774366*])

* When running the `oc adm node-logs` command with the `--since` argument, an
error occurred. This was caused by a typo in the expected timestamp format. The
typo has been corrected and the `oc adm node-logs` now works with the `--since`
argument. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1779563[*BZ#1779563*])

*openshift-apiserver*

* Previously, Helm 3.0.0+ did not work with OpenShift objects. This resulted in
an error when trying to deploy valid Helm charts. With this update it is now
possible to deploy Helm charts with OpenShift objects.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1773682[*BZ#1773682*])

*openshift-controller-manager*

* Previously, openshift-controler-manager metrics were not properly registered
with the 1.16 Kubernetes Prometheus registry. This caused missing metrics for
the OpenShift control plane. With this update the openshift-controller-manager
metrics are now properly registered and the missing OpenShift control plane
metrics have been restored.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1810304[*BZ#1810304*])

* Previously, pull secrets were sometimes not deleted when their associated
token was deleted. This caused pull secrets to remain associated with Kubernetes
service accounts. With this update references to the owner of a pull secret and
the associated token secret have been established. Now ,when a pull secret is
deleted the associated token is deleted as well.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1806792[*BZ#1806792*])

* Previously, the rate limit for creating pull secrets in the internal registry
was low. This caused long wait times when a large number of namespaces were
created in a short time period. With this update the rate limit for creating
pull secrets in the internal registry has been increased. Pull secrets can now
be created quickly even during heavy load.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1819849[*BZ#1819849*])

*RHCOS*

* Network teaming is now supported in RHEL CoreOS. The teamd and
NetworkManager-team RPMs have been added to RHEL CoreOS, enabling the setup and
management of teamed network devices.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1758162[*BZ#1758162*])

*Samples*

* IPv6 was not supported by registry.redhat.io, which meant that the Samples
Operator was not supposed to attempt to install imagestreams, as all Red Hat
samples are hosted on registry.redhat.io. Because IPv6 is a key initiative for
Red Hat and for {product-title}, the Samples Operator will no
longer break {product-title} installs on IPv6.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1788676[*BZ#1788676*])

* The Samples Operator was previously failing to report its version when running
on s390x or ppc64le, so installs on those architectures would not complete
successfully. With this fix, the Samples Operator now reports its version
correctly and no longer prevents installs on s390x or ppc64le.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1779933[*BZ#1779933*])

* Previously, the latest Java 11 imagestream tag did not correctly link to the
version on the Imagestream details page, which meant that that imagestreamtag
could not be inspected from the {product-title} web console. With this fix, the
correct imagestreamtag specification for Java 11 can now be properly inspected
from the web console.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1778613[*BZ#1778613*])

* Previously, local reference settings on imagestreams could be ignored if the
imagestream was accessed by controller manager shortly after startup but before
the imagestream metadata was updated. This resulted in failed requests to
imagestreams backed by private registries. With this update the controller
manager refreshes its imagestream cache after metadata initialization is
complete. This results in accurate local reference imagestream policies even
immediately after startup.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1775973[*BZ#1775973*])

*Storage*

* Pods could not be scheduled and PVCs remained pending if the `storage-class`
annotation was used instead of storeClassName for the Local Storage Operator.
With this fix, the Kubernetes scheduler now checks both
`volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class` and the `PVC.Spec.StorageClassName`
when evaluating a Pod and its PVCs. Pods that use the beta annotation to refer
to a StorageClass can now be scheduled and will now run.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1791786[*BZ#1791786*])

* Previously, Kubernetes did not unmount a CSI volume when a Pod was deleted
while the volume mount timed out before eventually being completed by the CSI
driver. This caused a volume to be mounted on a node without Kubernetes knowing
about it. As a result, the volume could not be mounted anywhere else.  With this
fix, Kubernetes waits for a final success or error after the CSI driver returns
a timeout or other similar transient error. Now, Kubernetes knows if a volume
was mounted or unmounted and cleans up possible stray mounts when a Pod is
deleted.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1745776[*BZ#1745776*])

*Templates*

* When using the `--param-file` option with template processing commands like
`oc new-app` or `oc process`, if the file was greater than 64K in size, it would
not be fully read in. This caused the  the `oc`-based template processing with
`--param-file` to fail. {product-title} now checks the size of the file
specified by `--process-file` and augments the parameters used to read the
entire file. The `oc`-based template processing with `--param-file` pointing to
files greater than 64K now works.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1748061[*BZ#1748061*])

* Previously, one of the new-app/new-build examples used for project creation
would cause an error in a FIPS environment because the example was not
FIPS-compliant. Now, only FIPS-compliant new-app/new-build examples are shown on
new project creation and users can use any of the examples in a FIPS
environment.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1774318[*BZ#1774318*])

*Web console (Administrator perspective)*

* Previously, the `Rebuild` action on the OpenShift Console build page was
incorrectly disabled for users who were did not have `cluster-admin` privileges.
Now, this issue has been resolved and the action is now correctly enabled for
normal users who should have permission to clone builds.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1774842[*BZ#1774842*])

* Previously, only cluster administrators could see example YAML templates
created using the `ConsoleYAMLSample` resource in console YAML editor. Now, all
users can see these templates.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1783163[*BZ#1783163*])

* On the CronJobs list page, sorting by `Starting Deadlines Seconds` or
`Concurrency Policy` fields were not sorted correctly. Now, the `sortField` has
been updated and you can now sort CronJobs correctly.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1787096[*BZ#1787096*])

* The Local Volumes page would display duplicate content due to conditions that
created content duplication. Now, the conditions are removed from the status
descriptors and content is not duplicated.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1776131[*BZ#1776131*])

* The Role Bindings page had a non-clickable Create Binding button for users who
did not have any projects. Now, the Create Binding button is hidden for users
who do not have any projects.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1785487[*BZ#1785487*])

* Previously, some required fields that have OLM descriptors were missing the
required red asterisk in the {product-title} console Create Operand form. Now
all of the required fields are correctly labeled.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1779858[*BZ#1779858*])

* Previously, you could set a negative value for the machine or replica count
values in the {product-title}  console. Now, you cannot set a value that is less
than 0. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1780367[*BZ#1780367*])

* Previously, the PodRing GUI component did not reflect the correct Pod count
when the count was updated on the Deployment Config Page and then updated again
on the same page by clicking Actions then Edit Count. For example, if the Pod
count was increased from 5 to 10 Pods by using Edit Count on the Deployment
Config Page and the user then increased the count on the PodRing component by
using the “up” arrow, the PodRing counter incorrectly increased from 5 to 6 Pods
instead of from 10 to 11. With this update, when a change is made using Edit
Count on the Deployment Config Page, the PodRing component now shows the
correct, updated Pod count. Additionally, when the user clicks the _up_ or
_down_ arrow on the PodRing component, the Pod count accurately updates.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1787210[*BZ#1787210*])

* Previously, a user could not edit a cluster-scoped operand on the Installed
Operators page in the web console. Instead, an HTTP `404 Not Found` client error
response code occurred in the web browser for the operand YAML editor. With this
update, the web console correctly opens a new web browser for the operand YAML
editor, in which a user can update a cluster-scoped operand.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1781246[*BZ#1781246*])

* Previously, the OpenShift web console did not replace all instances of a
variable when it occurred multiple times in a ConsoleExternalLogLink URL
template. Instead, only the first expression of the variable was replaced. With
this update, the console correctly replaces every instance of the variable in
the template with the correct value.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1781827[*BZ#1781827*])

* Previously on the Operator Details page in the web console, the link to the
InstallPlan resource from the Subscription Overview was broken. This made it
difficult for users to approve InstallPlans in the web console. The link to
approve InstallPlans (for example, a link showing output that `1 requires approval`)
now works as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1783651[*BZ#1783651*])

* Previously, an error occurred when a user filtered by source name in the Source
tab on the OperatorHub Details page in the web console. The filter has been
fixed and now works as expected when a user inputs a source name.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1786418[*BZ#1786418*])

* Previously, API documentation was missing for the Endpoints resource on the
Explore page in the web console. API documentation, such as descriptions and
schema information, is now available for the Endpoints resource.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1794754[*BZ#1794754*])

* Previously, the web console failed to show an operand if an invalid OLM
descriptor was set by an Operator. As a result, an error occurred on the
expected web console page. With this update, invalid OLM descriptors are
tolerated and the console correctly displays the operand details.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1797727[*BZ#1797727*])

* Previously, some status values did not have an icon associated with them. As a
result, some values appeared with an icon and others did not. Icons are now
defined for and will appear with all values.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1780629[*BZ#1780629*])

* Previously, the console did not check for special characters in routing
labels, which could result in the following error:
+
----
AlertmanagerFailedReload Alert:
Reloading Alertmanager's configuration has failed for openshift-monitoring/alertmanager-main-x.
----
+
The Create Receiver form now restricts label names to valid characters only.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1784725[*BZ#1784725*])

* Previously, the OpenShift console would show a blank page if an Operator
declared an invalid K8sResourceLink OLM descriptor. The console now tolerates
incorrect K8sResourceLink descriptors, which prevents the appearance of blank
pages. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1795407[*BZ#1795407*])

* Previously, modifying required Operator resources from the web UI would not
update those Operators' YAML files. The YAML files now update as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1797769[*BZ#1797769*])

* Previously, alerts remained in the notifications drawer after they were
silenced. Silenced alerts no longer remain in the notifications drawer.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1808062[*BZ#1808062*])

* A bug in OpenShift console builds occasionally resulted in runtime errors on
certain pages. The bug was fixed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1818978[*BZ#1818978*])

* The query browser results in the web console are rendered with a hard-coded
sort, rendering a different result than might be intended with a custom sort.
The hard-coded sort has been removed, allowing for the query results to reflect
any custom sort.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1808437[*BZ#1808437*])

* Creating a new MachineConfigPool using the console's *Compute* ->
*Machine Config Pools* -> *Create Machine Config Pool* button results in a
MachineConfigPool that does not match the node. This is caused by the template
using the `spec.machineSelector` key for selecting the nodes to match. However,
this key is not recognized by the API; the correct one for selecting a node is `spec.nodeSelector`. The key for selecting nodes has been updated, allowing the
GUI to display a Machine Selector which now matches the appropriate node.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1818944[*BZ#1818944*])

* Previously, the OpenShift console Pod terminal did not correctly handle
Unicode characters. This problem has been fixed, and Unicode characters now
display correctly.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821285[*BZ#1821285*])

* Previously, the volumes table on the OpenShift console workload pages could partially disappear when scrolling the page. This bug has been fixed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1822195[*BZ#1822195*])

* Previously, the default templates used to create reports and report queries
were using apiVersion `v1alpha` instead of `v1`. Although the alpha versioned
templates still worked, their case support could be dropped at any time. The
templates have been updated to use `apiVersion: metering.openshift.io/v1`.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1772694[*BZ#1772694*])

* When clicking the web console's Dashboard and selecting a navigation item
within the Dashboard, both navigation items that were selected remain
highlighted. This bug fix applies new CSS rules to eliminate multiple navigation
items from being highlighted at the same time, ensuring only the active
navigation item is highlighted.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1774702[*BZ#1774702*])

*Web console (Developer perspective)*

* The Microsoft Edge browser did not recognize the functionality used for
scrolling. The Log screen was unable to load and would result in an error.
Screen reader support was enabled and the logs now render.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgiid=1777980[*BZ#1777980*])

////
* The OpenShift Pipeline Operator v0.9.x+ did not work with the web console UI
because it referenced the removed `serviceAccount` API, which had been replaced
with `serviceAccountName`. The Pipeline Operator could not create Pipeline Runs
because of the wrong API reference. The OpenShift Pipeline Operator v0.9.x+ now
references the correct API and works with the web console UI.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1778958[*BZ#1778958*])
////

* Serverless resources like the Service YAML file are listed as `v1beta1`
instead of `v1`. However, `v1beta1` is deprecated. With this bug fix, the
`apiVersion` is updated to `v1`.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgiid=1796421[*BZ#1796421*])

* A service binding request (SBR) in the topology is associated with *Revisions*
in the topology view. Therefore, no new revision will get the associated
secrets. The SBR should go through the knative service; secrets would be
injected and new revisions would be created.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgiid=1798288[*BZ#1798288*]

* The API group of `KnativeServing` resources `serving.knative.dev` is
deprecated and it has changed to `operator.knative.dev` in the Serverless
Operator version 1.4. In the next release of the Serverless Operator,
`serving.knative.dev` will be obsolete.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgiid=1800598[*BZ#1800598*]

* In container image deployment, if an internal image stream is selected for
knative, then knative tries to create a new image stream, which might fail. You
are unable to deploy the internal image stream as a knative service. Do not
create a new image stream for internal image selection; it already exists.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgiid=1808280[*BZ#1808280*]

* In a Kubernetes deployment, if the images from the external image registry had
tags such as `openshift/hello-world:1.0`, then the tags were not being applied.
The user was unable to import external images with tags. With this big fix, the
proper tag for the deployment is now passed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgiid=1801736[*BZ#1801736*]

* Previously, when two consecutive rollouts failed, the *Topology* view showed
failed pods instead of displaying the last active revision. With this bug fix,
when a rollout fails, the last active revision is displayed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1760828[*BZ#1760828*])

* Previously, existing imagestreams in a namespace were not detected when
creating an application. This occurred when users with limited cluster-wide
permissions used the *Container Image* -> *Image* name from the internal
registry* options in the *Add* page. Now, the imagestream fetching logic has
been moved from the cluster level to the namespace level, which enables a user
with permission to a namespace to see imagestreams in that namespace.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1784264[*BZ#1784264*])

* Knative service and revision resources did not have binding or visual
connectors in the Topology view and therefore Knative workloads could not
connect to other workloads. These resources now have connectors in the Topology
view and can connect to other workloads.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1779201[*BZ#1779201*])

* When the Eclipse Che Operator was installed and configured, the Topology view
showed the Git icon instead of the Che icon. This provided no indication to the
user that they could click the icon to access the Che workspace. The Topology
view now correctly displays the Che icon when Che is configured, making it
easier for the user to access the Che workspace.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1780338[*BZ#1780338*])

* Creating a Knative service using the CLI while the Topology view was open
caused a GUI error. Checks have been added to handle this workload without
causing a GUI error.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1781188[*BZ#1781188*])

////
* When adding resources to a pipeline, the Save button was disabled even when
all fields were populated correctly. As a result, changes could not be saved.
The page now validates correctly and the Save button works as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1792176[*BZ#1792176*])

* When OpenShift Pipeline was enabled and a user without permission to view the
Pipeline templates created an application with Source-to-Image, the Pipelines
section displayed a loading indicator indefinitely. A permissions check now
prevents the GUI from trying to load a section the user does not have
permission to view.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1792179[*BZ#1792179*])

* The Overview page for Pipelines that used ClusterTasks instead of regular
tasks displayed them as regular tasks with incorrect links. The Overview page
for Pipelines that use ClusterTasks now shows them as ClusterTasks with
functioning links.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1775704[*BZ#1775704*])
////

* The internal registry feature had an unclear error message when there was a
server-side error. Improved error messaging helps the user identify the cause of
the problem.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1787492[*BZ#1787492*])

[id="ocp-4-4-known-issues"]
== Known issues

* There is an issue with the Machine Config Operator (MCO) supporting Day 2
proxy support, which describes when an existing non-proxied
cluster is reconfigured to use a proxy. The MCO should apply newly configured
proxy CA certificates in a ConfigMap to the {op-system} trust bundle; this is
not working. As a workaround, you must manually add the proxy CA certificate to
your trust bundle and then update the trust bundle:
+
----
$ cp /opt/registry/certs/<my_root_ca>.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
$ update-ca-trust extract
$ oc adm drain <node>
$ systemctl reboot
----
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1784201[*BZ#1784201*])

* When using a self-signed {rh-openstack-first} 16 cluster, you cannot pull from
or push to an internal image registry. As a workaround, you must set
`spec.disableRedirect` to `true` in the `configs.imageregistry/cluster` resource.
This allows the client to pull the image layers from the image registry rather
than from links directly from Swift.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1810461[*BZ#1810461*])

* The cluster proxy configuration `HTTP_PROXY` is only available for
{product-title} components, not user applications. As a workaround, you must run
the following command to enable cluster proxy configuration for user
applications:
+
----
$ oc set env dc/jenkins \
    http_proxy=$(oc get proxy cluster -o jsonpath='{.status.httpProxy}') \
    https_proxy=$(oc get proxy cluster -o jsonpath='{.status.httpsProxy}') \
    no_proxy=$(oc get proxy cluster -o jsonpath='{.status.noProxy}')
----
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1780125[*BZ#1780125*])

* All `git clone` operations that go through an HTTPS proxy fail. HTTP proxies
can be used successfully.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1750650[*BZ#1750650*])

* All `git clone` operations fail in builds running behind a proxy if the source
URIs use the `git://` or `ssh://` scheme.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1751738[*BZ#1751738*])

* When using a mirror to build images, the build fails when the pull secret for
the mirror registry only links to the builder service account. The pull secret
must also link to the build config object.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1810904[*BZ#1810904*])

* In {rh-openstack-first} 13 with Kuryr, if FIPS is disabled, you cannot enable
Service Catalog. Pods for Service Catalog's controller manager and API server
components show a status of `CrashLoopBackOff`. This is due to the
`\https://etcd.openshift-etcd.svc.cluster.local:2379` URL not always resolving.
There is a new technique for getting the etcd cluster URL in {product-title} 4.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821589[*BZ#1821589*])

* Installing {rh-openstack} 16 with Kuryr does not work due to the
`ovn_controller` crashing after initial setup.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1812009[*BZ#1812009*], link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1818844[*BZ#1818844*])

* The Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) machine `instance-state` annotation and the
`providerStatus.instanceState` status do not always match. This mismatch causes
the client to fail or incorrectly patch the RHV machine status.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1815394[*BZ#1815394*])

* When scaling up a MachineSet on RHV, the new machine cannot exit the
`Provisioned` phase. This causes the machine to never run.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1815435[*BZ#1815435*], link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1817853[*BZ#1817853*])

* {product-title} cluster autoscaling on RHV fails due to cluster resource
computation errors.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1822118[*BZ#1822118*])

* When using the Firefox browser to select a node or a group of nodes in the *Topology* view, the backgrounds of all the associated labels and nodes become transparent. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1822337[*BZ#1822337*])

* In the *Topology view*, when a user selects a node or workload, and then  clicks *Monitoring* -> *View monitoring dashboard* on the side panel, the user sees the monitoring dashboard for that specific workload. This filtered workload dashboard view is not clearly named, which causes confusion with the generic dashboard that displays metrics for all the workloads. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1822331[*BZ#1822331*])

* When invalid characters such as a period (.) are entered in the serverless traffic distribution tag from the *Developer* perspective, the traffic distribution feature stops working. However, it displays no error messages to prevent invalid characters from being entered in the tag. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1822344[*BZ#1822344*])

* If an identity provider (IDP) takes longer than 60 seconds to authenticate a user, the authentication might fail before trying other IDPs. As a workaround, you can remove the faulty IDP from the list of IDPs so that users can use a successful IDP to authenticate. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1826484[*BZ#1826484*])

* When updating cluster logging from version 4.3 to 4.4, the Elasticsearch Pods
might get stuck in the `CrashLoopBackOff` status. You can work around this
issue by deleting the Elasticsearch deployments in sequence.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1824006[*BZ#1824006*])

* {product-title} 4.4 is not shipping with a v.4.4 Metering Operator. Customers can install or continue to run the v.4.3 Metering Operator on {product-title} 4.4 clusters.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1829035[*BZ#1829035*])

* When updating an {product-title} cluster from version 4.3 to 4.4, the etcd
Operator sometimes fails to upgrade because it is in a degraded state.
This is caused by an InstallerPod failure. As a workaround, you must force a new
revision on etcd to overcome the InstallerPod failure, which allows the etcd
Operator to recover:
+
. Force a new revision on etcd:
+
----
$ oc patch etcd cluster -p='{"spec": {"forceRedeploymentReason": "recovery-'"$( date --rfc-3339=ns )"'"}}' --type=merge
----
+
. Verify the nodes are at the latest revision:
+
----
$ oc get etcd '-o=jsonpath={range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="NodeInstallerProgressing")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'
----
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1830789[*BZ#1830789*])

* The web console downloads deployment will fail on nodes configured with `ipv6.disable=1`.
 (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1795325[*BZ1795325*])

* An issue in Topology Manager could result in NUMA resources not being aligned to the same NUMA node if Guaranteed QoS Pods are created simultaneously on the same node.
As a result, the resources requested in the pod spec might not be NUMA aligned.
+
To avoid this issue in 4.4, do not spin up multiple Pods with a Guaranteed QoS on a node simultaneously.
+
If you encounter this issue, delete and then recreate the Pod.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1834979[*BZ#1834979*])

* VMs with the `runStrategy` attribute set to `Manual` do not indicate whether
they are running or stopped, and the web console incorrectly assumes they are
running. To avoid this issue, do not set `runStrategy` to `Manual` when working
with VMs in the web console. Instead, use the `running` attribute or set
`runStrategy` to `Always`, `RerunOnFailure`, or `Halted`.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1834717[*BZ#1834717*])

* When upgrading to a new {product-title} z-stream release, connectivity to the API server might be interrupted as nodes are upgraded, causing API requests to fail. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1791162[*BZ#1791162*])

* When upgrading to a new {product-title} z-stream release, connectivity to routers might be interrupted as router Pods are updated. For the duration of the upgrade, some applications might not be consistently reachable. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1809665[*BZ#1809665*])

* Due to an issue related to expiring OAuth tokens, you might receive
a *security_exception* error in the Kibana console and not be able to access
your Kibana indices. If you see this error, log out of the Kibana console then
log back in. This will refresh your OAuth tokens and you should be able to
access your indices.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1791837[*BZ#1791837*])

* Git clone operations that go through an HTTPS proxy fail. Non-TLS (HTTP)
proxies can be used successfully.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1750650[*BZ#1750650*])

* Git clone operations fail in builds running behind a proxy if the source URIs
use the `git://` or `ssh://` scheme.

link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5118201[{product-title} 4.4.6 container image list]

[[ocp-4-4-6-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* Previously, the implementation of disconnected support for the Samples
Operator caused problems for some users. The implementation allowed the
samplesRegistry override to be applied to the CVO-based Jenkins imagestreams,
which made using the samplesRegistry override in other scenarios more difficult.
With this update, the samplesRegistry override is no longer needed and the
associated problems with the previous implementation are avoided.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1824280[*BZ#1824280*])

* Previously, the operand list in the Installed Operators page could show a
status from the custom resource `status.conditions` where the condition did not
have `status: true`, meaning the status shown could be incorrect. The web
console now only shows a status for a condition with `status: true`.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1829591[*BZ#1829591*])

* Previously, if a sample template from an earlier release was removed in a
subsequent release, an upgrade to the subsequent release could fail if the
missing template was incorrectly tracked as needing to be updated. With this
release, the upgrade process no longer attempts to update templates that
existed in a prior release but not in the release being upgraded to.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1832344[*BZ#1832344*])

* Previously, when a Cluster Version Operator tried to serve metrics over HTTPS
but could not find a TLS key and certificate, the action failed. With this
update, the monitoring Operator creates a TLS key and certificate so that the
Cluster Version Operator can serve metrics over HTTPS.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1835483[*BZ#1835483*])

* Previously, the only way to customize worker or master VM specifications was
to customize the RHV or oVirt template before installation and then configure
an environment variable to make the installer use that template. With this
release, MachinePool has been implemented for this platform and exposed in the
`install-config.yaml` file. Worker and master VM instances are now created with
the specifications included in the MachinePool configuration. Because different
disk sizes are now supported, the default disk size is updated to 120 GB.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1835795[*BZ#1835795*])

* Previously, incorrect quota behavior could cause deploying or building Pods to
fail. With this release, the build controller is updated so that quotas are
handled properly for builds.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1835913[*BZ#1835913*])

* Previously, the web console stopped responding when a user created a
PipelineRun using the CLI or YAML. With this update, checks have been added to
avoid the web console error.

release:

link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5132771[{product-title} 4.4.8 container image list]

[[ocp-4-4-8-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* Previously, the installation program required the user to manually create
a virtual machine template before it could create an OpenShift cluster on
Red Hat Virtualization (RHV). This is because the installation program did
not meet the following requirements in RHV version 4.3.9: 1) The
installation program must pass the ignition to the virtual machine, and 2)
The template must specify its OS type as Red Hat CoreOS (RHCOS). The
installation program now creates a template that specifies RHCOS as the OS
type, and it passes the ignition to the VM. The user no longer needs to
create a virtual machine template.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821638[*BZ#1821638*])

* Previously, the Elasticsearch Operator and Cluster Logging Operator did
not reconcile the injected CA Bundle contents for Fluentd. This caused
Fluentd and Kibana to have missing volume mounts to ConfigMaps with an
injected CA bundle. Now the ConfigMap contents are fetched during
reconciliation to make sure the volumes mount. This allows Fluentd and
Kibana to mount the CA bundle ConfigMaps appropriately and certification to
work again.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1833288[*BZ#1833288*])

* The `oc adm node drain` command was not properly accounting for
DaemonSets and local data attached to Pods when draining a node due to an
incorrect condition in the {product-title} code. The logic has
been fixed, so all Pods are accounted for when draining a node. When trying
to drain a node that has a DaemonSet's Pod running, or when a Pod has local
volume data attached, the `oc adm node drain` command now fails, advising
to use flags that will ignore the two cases.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1835739[*BZ#1835739*])

* Previously in the web console when attempting to edit a YAML file, a
JavaScript exception in the Safari web browser would cause the YAML editing
page to never load. This bug is now fixed, allowing YAML file editing to
work in the Safari web browser.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1838815[*BZ#1838815*])

* Previously, the Installed Operators column in the web console assumed
that all installed Operators had a subscription. Since the Package Server
Operator does not have a subscription, its status was being incorrectly
displayed as removed, even though it was present. The Package Server
Operator status has been fixed to not rely on its subscription status, so
it now correctly displays on the Installed Operators page.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1840647[*BZ#1840647*])

////
* Previously, when logging out from the Kibana dashboard, it was still possible
to log in again from a new browser tab without specifying the login credentials.
This was caused by the signoff link pointing to an incorrect handler for the
OAuth proxy that provided security for Kibana. The signoff link is now fixed,
forcing login credentials when attempting to reaccess the Kibana dashboard.

////
// Bug dropped and will be re-added in future 4.4.z release.

* When navigating to the *Advanced* -> *Project Details* -> *Inventory* section
from the Developer perspective of the web console, DeploymentConfigs were not
listed. The DeploymentConfigs are now tracked and are included in the
Inventory section of the dashboard.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1825975[*BZ#1825975*])

* Previously, Pod log pages did not include a query string parameter indicating
the selected container. This caused Pods with more than one container to report
incorrect container logs when refreshing the page or visiting the page's URL. A
new query string parameter has been added so the URL indicates which container's
logs should display.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1827197[*BZ#1827197*])

* Previously, the web console only showed the name, namespace, and creation date
when listing OLM Subscriptions on the Search page. The web console now shows
additional OLM Subscription details.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1827746[*BZ#1827746*])

* When recovering from an expired control plane certificate, the cluser is
unable to connect to the recovery API server on port 7443. This is caused by the
recovery API server's port conflicting with the HAProxy port used for OpenStack,
oVirt, bare metal, and vSphere. This results in an `Unable to connect to the
server: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority` error. HAProxy now
listens on port 9443, allowing the recovery API server to use port 7443 to
facilitate the recovery process for an expired control plane certificate.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1831008[*BZ#1831008*])

* The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) had special-case handling for its
CredentialsRequest CR that required the existence of the cloud root credentials.
If the cloud root credentials were missing, the CCO was unable to reconcile its
own read-only CredentialsRequest CR. This was fixed by using the read-only
CredentialsRequest credentials to validate the read-only CredentialsRequest. Now
when removing the cloud root credentials, the CCO is not degraded.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1838810[*BZ#1838810*])

* Previously, when clicking on a Task bubble in the Pipeline Builder that did
not have an associated Task, a blank screen appeared. This has been fixed by
converting the node to a list node, allowing you to change it in place. Now you
can update Task references that no longer point at a Task or ClusterTask
resource.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1840954[*BZ#1840954*])

* Sample Operator file system errors were being incorrectly reported as API
server errors in the Cluster Operator reason field. Also, details on the actual
API server errors when manipulating API server objects did not provide details
on the exact type of failure. This caused incorrect degraded errors to be
reported. Now the Sample Operator file system errors are reported as file system
errors in the degraded reason field, and API server errors reported in the
degraded reason field include the specific error type.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1842560[*BZ#1842560*])

* The Cluster Version Operator (CVO) had a race condition where it would
consider a timed-out update reconciliation cycle a successful update. This only
happened for restricted network clusters where the Operator timed out attempting
to fetch release image signatures. This bug caused the CVO to enter its
shuffled-manifest reconciliation mode, which could break the cluster if the
manifests were applied in an order that the components could not handle. The CVO
now treats timed-out updates as failures, so it no longer enters reconciling
mode before the update succeeds.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1843732[*BZ#1843732*])

* Previously, RHEL 8 VMs in clusters running on Azure could lose network
connectivity. This was caused by a defect in the Hyper-V netvsc driver in RHEL.
This bug is fixed in RHEL, and that fix is now available for RHEL VMs used in
clusters. As a result, clusters running on Azure no longer experience network
connectivity issues caused by the netvsc driver defect.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1841900[*BZ#1841900*])

This update also introduces the following enhancement:

* An enhancement has been added for {product-title} to extend
the `oc adm release mirror` command. A cluster upgrade can be accomplished
on a cluster that does not have an active connection to the internet.
Previously, however, manual steps were required to create a ConfigMap
containing the signature data required for the image update verification.
The command now creates and applies ConfigMap manifests containing the
release image signature automatically, which the Cluster Version Operator
uses to verify the mirrored release.

==== Upgrading

To upgrade an existing {product-title} 4.4 cluster to this latest release, see
xref:../updating/updating-cluster-between-minor.html#update-upgrading-web_updating-cluster-between-minor[Updating a cluster by using the web console]
for instructions.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are upgrading to this release from {product-title} 4.3.3 or earlier, you
must restart all Pods after the upgrade is complete.

This is because the service CA is automatically rotated as of {product-title}
4.3.5. The service CA is rotated during the upgrade, and a restart is required
afterward to ensure that all services use the new service CA before the
previous service CA expires.

After this one-time manual restart, subsequent upgrades and rotations will
ensure restart before the service CA expires without requiring manual
intervention.

==== Features

[[ocp-4-4-9-added-nodejs-jenkins-agent-v10-and-v12]]
===== Added Node.js Jenkins Agent v10 and v12

The `jenkins-agent-nodejs-10-rhel7` and `jenkins-agent-nodejs-12-rhel7` images
are now added to {product-title}. These new images allow Jenkins Pipelines to
be upgraded to use either v10 or v12 of the Node.js Jenkins Agent. The Node.js
v8 Jenkins Agent is now deprecated, but will continue to be provided. For
existing clusters, you must manually upgrade the Node.js Jenkins Agent, which
can be performed on a per namespace basis. Follow these steps to complete the
manual upgrade:

. Select the project for which you want to upgrade the Jenkins Pipelines:
+
----
$ oc project <project_name>
----

. Import the new Node.js Jenkins Agent image:
+
----
$ oc import-image nodejs openshift4/jenkins-agent-nodejs-10-rhel7 --from=registry.redhat.io/openshift4/jenkins-agent-nodejs-10-rhel7 --confirm
----
+
This command imports the v10 image. If you prefer v12, update the image
specifications accordingly.

. Overwrite the current Node.js Jenkins Agent with the new one you imported:
+
----
$ oc label is nodejs role=jenkins-slave --overwrite
----

. Verify in the Jenkins log that the new Jenkins Agent template is configured:
+
----
$ oc logs -f jenkins-1-<pod>
----

[[ocp-4-4-9-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* In the virtual machine and virtual machine template wizards, *virtIO* is the
default interface when you attach a CD-ROM. However, a *virtIO* CD-ROM does not
pass virtual machine validation and cannot be created. As a workaround, select
*SATA* as the CD-ROM interface when you create virtual machines and virtual
machine templates.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1817394[*BZ#1817394*])

* Previously, when logging out from the Kibana dashboard, it was still possible
to log in again from a new browser tab without specifying the login credentials.
This was caused by the signoff link pointing to an incorrect handler for the
OAuth proxy that provided security for Kibana. The signoff link is now fixed,
forcing login credentials when attempting to reaccess the Kibana dashboard.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1823305[*BZ#1823305*])

* The *View more* link on the *Installed Operators* page now links to the
correct page.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1824255[*BZ#1824255*])

* With this release, the *Status* column on the operand view in the web console
is updated to show the latest status that is available in the *Details* and
*YAML* views.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1831808[*BZ#1831808*])

* With this release, the `eventSources` API Group is updated to the latest
supported API Group, `sources.knative.dev`. This update allows sources generated
by the new API Group to be recognized in the *Topology* view of the web console.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1836807[*BZ#1836807*])

* Previously, environment variables for Knative service could not be specified
from the *Add* view of the *Developer* perspective in the web console. As a
result, applications that required environment variables might not work as
expected. With this release, users can add environment variables from the *Add*
view.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1839115[*BZ#1839115*])

* Previously, the web console did not display user details when the user name
contained special characters such as `#`. The web console now displays user
details regardless of special characters in the user name.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1840812[*BZ#1840812*])

* After upgrading Octavia from OpenStack 13 to 16, the UDP listener is supported
and the strategy to enforce DNS resolution over TCP protocol is removed. This
change requires adding the new listener to the existent DNS service that
specifies the UDP protocol. The old Amphora image for the existent DNS load
balancer does not support the new listener and causes the listener creation to
fail. With this release, the DNS service that requires UDP is re-created,
causing the load balancer to be re-created with the new Amphora version.
Re-creating the service and load balancer causes some down time for DNS
resolution. When this process is complete, the load balancer for the DNS service
is created with all the required listeners.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1841029[*BZ#1841029*])

* Previously, the web console did not create the role binding required for the
OpenShift Monitoring Prometheus Operator to collect Operator metrics when the
`operatorframework.io/cluster-monitoring=true` annotation was set to `true`. The
issue is resolved in this release.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1841149[*BZ#1841149*])

* Previously, autoscaler required provider IDs across Node and Machine objects
to match exactly, and if the Machine configuration specified a resource group
name with mixed casing, the ID was not an exact match. In this situation,
autoscaler did not recognize that a machine had a node and terminated the
machine after 15 minutes. With this release, autoscaler ignores the case of
letters in provider IDs so that they match regardless of case.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1841478[*BZ#1841478*])

* On the Azure platform, the `cifs-utils` package is required to create volume
mounts for Pods. With this release, `cifs-utils` is included in the packages
installed for RHEL 7 hosts when installing {product-title}.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1845819[*BZ#1845819*])

* Previously, SELinux permissions blocked read/write access to mounted volumes
on the Azure platform. With this release, SELinux booleans are updated to match
{op-system} 8.x and allow proper access.

link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5181451[{product-title} 4.4.10 container image list]

[[ocp-4-4-10-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* Previously, the ingress controller added a `Forwarded` HTTP header with a
non-standard `proto-version` parameter when forwarding an HTTP request to an
application. This non-standard header caused problems when applications tried
to parse the header value. With this release, the ingress controller no longer
specifies a `proto-version` parameter in the `Forwarded` header.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1816544[*BZ#1816544*])

* Previously, the value for the `maxUnhealthy` field on a MachineHealthCheck
accepted multiple value formats, for example `10`, `"10"`, or `"10%"`. Values in
quotes were  interpreted as a percent value even if they did not contain a
percentage sign. This interpretation of the `maxUnhealthy` value might not have
matched the user's intention and machines might have been remediated when they
were not meant to be or not been remediated when they were meant to be. With
this release, only values that contain a percentage sign are interpreted as a
percentage. For example, `10` and `"10"` are now interpreted as the same value,
and not as 10%.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1816606[*BZ#1816606*])

* Previously, metrics did not bind on an IPv6 address and could not be scraped.
With this release, metrics can be scraped correctly on an IPv6 address.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1819770[*BZ#1819770*])

* Previously, *Edit ClusterServiceVersion* was present on the *Actions* menu for
the ClusterServiceVersion, which might erroneously give users the impression
that ClusterServiceVersion should be edited. With this release,
*Edit ClusterServiceVersion* is removed from the *Actions* menu for the
ClusterServiceVersion.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1827306[*BZ#1827306*])

* Previously, some resources did not have the empty state of `None` when no
resource was present. The lack of this state was inconsistent with other
resources and caused ambiguity. With this release, these resources now have an
empty state of `None` when no resource is present.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1827766[*BZ#1827766*])

* Previously, the spacing between masthead dropdown items was larger than it
should have been. This display issue has been resolved.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1829030[*BZ#1829030*])

* Previously, Pipeline Builder incorrectly interpreted a default value of an
empty string (`''`) as having no default. However, some Operator-provided tasks
cannot work without an empty string as the default value. With this release, any
value the OpenShift Pipeline Operator accepts as a default value, including an
empty string, is recognized as a valid default value.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1829568[*BZ#1829568*])

* Previously, controllers within the OpenShift Controller Manager Operator did
not use named work queues and some metrics, such as `workqueue_depth`, did not
appear in Prometheus. With this release, the controllers use named work queues
and these metrics appear in Prometheus.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1832839[*BZ#1832839*])

* Previously, Ironic containers in {product-title} failed to start if the
user-defined `PROV_IFACE` interface was configured for IPv6 and used link-local
addressing instead of globally routable addressing. With this release, the
container startup script accepts link-local addressing in addition to global
addressing.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1838083[*BZ#1838083*])

* Previously, OVN containers requested more CPU and RAM than necessary, leaving
less for user workloads. With this release, OVN requests are adjusted to match
actual requirements.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1844245[*BZ#1844245*])

* Previously, the Terraform step `openstack_networking_floatingip_associate_v2`
did not list all its dependent steps, and the resulting omission of a dependent
step sometimes caused a race condition that occasionally caused the Terraform
job to fail, especially on overloaded systems. With this release, the dependant
Terraform step is listed as `depends_on` to force the  Terraform steps to run in
the correct order.

[[ocp-4-4-12-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* Previously, having several listeners on different protocols on the same
port for the `ovn-octavia` driver was not supported and was blocked. With this
release, it is supported and there is no need to block it. Several listeners on
different protocols can be exposed in the same port. This means that it is
possible to have, for instance, the DNS service to expose port 53 in both TCP
and UDP protocols when using `ovn-octavia`.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1847558[*BZ#1847558*])

* Previously, the CoreDNS forward plug-in used a random server selection policy
by default. As a result, clusters failed to resolve the OpenStack API hostname
if given multiple external DNS resolvers. The plugin now uses DNS servers in the
order they are provided.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1851267[*BZ#1851267*])

* Previously, if Fluentd was deployed standalone using the CLO, it crashed due
to missing configuration details. With this release, an empty Fluentd
configuration is provided to enable Pods to start, and a status is added to
inform users that manual intervention is required.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1851381[*BZ#1851381*])

* During installation or upgrade, the `openshift-controller-manager` did not
correctly report its progress condition. As a result, an installation or upgrade
might fail. Now the Operator correctly reports its progress upon a successful
installation or upgrade.

==== Upgrading

To upgrade an existing {product-title} 4.4 cluster to this latest release, see
xref:../updating/updating-cluster-between-minor.html#update-upgrading-web_updating-cluster-between-minor[Updating a cluster by using the web console]
for instructions.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are upgrading to this release from {product-title} 4.3.3 or earlier, you
must restart all Pods after the upgrade is complete.

This is because the service CA is automatically rotated as of {product-title}
4.3.5. The service CA is rotated during the upgrade, and a restart is required
afterward to ensure that all services use the new service CA before the
previous service CA expires.

After this one-time manual restart, subsequent upgrades and rotations will
ensure restart before the service CA expires without requiring manual
intervention.
