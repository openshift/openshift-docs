provides a more secure and scalable multi-tenant operating system for today’s
enterprise-class applications, while delivering integrated application runtimes
and libraries. {product-title} enables organizations to meet security, privacy,
compliance, and governance requirements.

[[ocp-311-about-this-release]]
== About This Release

Red Hat {product-title} 3.11
(link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018:2652[RHBA-2018:2652]) is now
available. This release is based on
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/tag/v3.11.0[OKD 3.11],
and it uses Kubernetes 1.11. New features, changes, bug fixes, and known issues
that pertain to {product-title} 3.11 are included in this topic.

{product-title} 3.11 is supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 and later with
the latest packages from Extras, including CRI-O 1.11 and Docker 1.13. It is
also supported on Atomic Host 7.5 and later.

{product-title} 3.11 is supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 nodes running in
Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) mode. However, neither the CRI-O nor Docker runtimes use FIPS-validated cryptography when running {product-title} version {product-version} on RHEL in FIPS mode

[NOTE]
====
If you need the network traffic between nodes, also known as east-west traffic, to be encrypted with FIPS validated cryptography,
xref:../admin_guide/ipsec.adoc#admin-guide-ipsec[encrypt traffic between nodes with IPsec].
====

For initial installations, see the
xref:../install/index.adoc#install-planning[Installing Clusters] documentation.

To upgrade to this release from a previous version, see the
xref:../upgrading/index.adoc#install-config-upgrading-index[Upgrading Clusters]
documentation.

[WARNING]
====
In the initial release of {product-title} version 3.11, downgrading does not
completely restore your cluster to version 3.10. Do not downgrade.

If you need to downgrade, contact Red Hat support so they can help you determine
the best course of action.

[[ocp-311-new-features-and-enhancements]]
== New Features and Enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

[[ocp-311-operators]]
=== Operators

[[ocp-311-operator-lifecycle-manager]]
==== Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) (Technology Preview)

This feature is currently in xref:ocp-311-technology-preview[Technology Preview]
and not for production workloads.

The OLM aids cluster administrators in installing, upgrading, and granting
access to Operators running on their cluster:

* Includes a catalog of curated Operators, with the ability to load other Operators into the cluster
* Handles rolling updates of all Operators to new versions
* Supports role-based access control (RBAC) for certain teams to use certain Operators

See
xref:../install_config/installing-operator-framework.adoc#installing-operator-framework[Installing the Operator Framework]
for more information.

[[ocp-311-operator-sdk]]
==== Operator SDK

The Operator SDK is a development tool to jump-start building an Operator with
generated code and a CLI to aid in building, testing, and publishing your
Operator. The Operator SDK:

* Provides tools to get started quickly embedding application business logic into an Operator
* Saves you from doing the work to set up scaffolding to communicate with the Kubernetes API
* Helps run end-to-end tests of your logic on a local or remote cluster
* Is used by Couchbase, MongoDB, Redis and more

See link:https://docs.okd.io/latest/operators/osdk-getting-started.html[Getting started with the Operator SDK]
in OKD documentation for more information and walkthroughs.

[[ocp-311-brokers]]
=== Brokers

Brokers mediate service requests in the Service Catalog. The goal is for you to initiate the request and for the system to fulfill the request in an automated fashion.

[[ocp-311-automation-broker-ansible]]
==== {product-title} Automation Broker Integration with Ansible Galaxy

The Automation Broker manages applications defined in Ansible Playbook Bundles (APB). {product-title} 3.11 includes support for discovering and running APB sources published to Ansible Galaxy from the {product-title} Automation Broker.

See xref:../architecture/service_catalog/ansible_service_broker.adoc#arch-ansible-service-broker[OpenShift Automation Broker] for more information.

[[ocp-311-broker-support-authenticated-registries]]
==== Broker Support for Authenticated Registries

The Red Hat Container Catalog is moving from `registry.access.redhat.com` to
`registry.redhat.io`. `registry.redhat.io` requires authentication for access to
images and hosted content on {product-title}.

{product-title} 3.11 adds support for authenticated
registries. The broker uses `cluster-wide` as the default setting for registry
authentication credentials. You can define `oreg_auth_user` and
`oreg_auth_password` in the inventory file to configure the credentials.

[[ocp-311-service-catalog-namespaced-brokers]]
==== Service Catalog Namespaced Brokers

The Service Catalog added support for namespaced brokers in addition to the
previous cluster scoped behavior. This means you can register the broker with
the service catalog as either a cluster-scoped `ClusterServiceBroker` or a
namespace-scoped `ServiceBroker` kind. Depending on the broker's scope, its
services and plans are available to the entire cluster or scoped to a specific
namespace. When installing the broker, you can set the `kind` argument as
`ServiceBroker` (namespace-specific) or `ClusterServiceBroker` (cluster-wide).

[[ocp-311-installtion-and-upgrade]]
=== Installation and Upgrade

[[ocp-311-checks-for-expiring-certificates]]
==== Checks for Expiring Certificates During Upgrade

In {product-title} 3.11, `openshift_certificate_expiry_warning_days`, which
indicates the amount of time the auto-generated certificates must be valid for
an upgrade to proceed, is added.

Additionally, `openshift_certificate_expiry_fail_on_warn` is added, which
determines whether the upgrade fails if the auto-generated certificates are not
valid for the period specified by the
`openshift_certificate_expiry_warning_days` parameter.

See
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#install-config-configuring-inventory-file[Configuring
Your Inventory File] for more information.

[[ocp-311-support-for-ansible-2-9]]
==== Support for Ansible 2.9

Although the minimum version of Ansible required for {product-title} 3.11 to run
playbooks is 2.5.7, `openshift-ansible` now requires Ansible 2.9 for both installation of
{product-title} 3.11 and upgrading from version 3.10.

On both master and node, use `subscription-manager` to
enable the repositories that are necessary to install {product-title}
using Ansible 2.9. For example:

----
$ subscription-manager repos --enable="rhel-7-server-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.11-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ansible-2.9-rpms"
----

[[ocp-311-registry-auth-credentials-required]]
==== Registry Auth Credentials Are Now Required

Registry auth credentials are now required for {product-title} so that images
and metadata can be pulled from an authenticated registry, registry.redhat.io.

Registry auth credentials are required prior to installing  and upgrading when:

* `openshift_deployment_type` == `‘openshift-enterprise’`
* `oreg_url` == `‘registry.redhat.io’` or undefined

To configure authentication, `oreg_auth_user` and
`oreg_auth_password` must be defined in the inventory file.

Pods can also be allowed to reference images from other secure registries.

See xref:../dev_guide/managing_images.adoc#private-registries[Importing Images
from Private Registries] for more information.

[[ocp-311-customer-installations-are-logged]]
==== Customer Installations Are Now logged

Ansible configuration is now updated to ensure {product-title} installations are
logged by default.

The Ansible configuration parameter `log_path` is now defined. Users must be in
the *_/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible_* directory prior to running any
playbooks.

[[ocp-311-cluster-logging-upgrade]]
==== Cluster Logging Update Retains Kibana Proxy Values

When updating to the {product-title} version 3.11.141 or higher, the update automatically
takes the PROXY values from the inventory file and updates the Kibana deployment configuration directly.

[[ocp-311-storage]]
=== Storage

[[ocp-311-openshift-container-storage]]
==== OpenShift Container Storage

link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_container_storage/3.11/[OpenShift
Container Storage] (OCS) provides software defined storage as a container for
use with {product-title}. Use OCS to define
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#types-of-persistent-volumes[persistent
volumes] (PV) for use with your containers.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1645358[*BZ#1645358*])


[[ocp-311-container-storage-Interface]]
==== Container Storage Interface (Technology Preview)

This feature is currently in xref:ocp-311-technology-preview[Technology Preview] and not for production workloads.

CSI allows {product-title} to consume storage from storage backends that
implement the link:https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec[CSI
interface] as
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent
storage].

See
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_csi.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-csi[Persistent
Storage Using Container Storage Interface (CSI)] for more information.

[[ocp-311-local-ephemeral-storage]]
==== Protection of Local Ephemeral Storage (Technology Preview)

This feature is currently in xref:ocp-311-technology-preview[Technology Preview]
and not for production workloads.

You can now control the use of the local ephemeral storage feature on your
nodes. This helps prevent users from exhausting node local storage with their
pods and other pods that happen to be on the same node.

This feature is disabled by default. If enabled, the {product-title} cluster
uses ephemeral storage to store information that does not need to persist after
the cluster is destroyed.

See
xref:../install_config/configuring_ephemeral.adoc#install-config-configuring-ephemeral-storage[Configuring
Ephemeral Storage] for more information.

[[ocp-311-pv-provisioning-using-openstack-manilla]]
==== Persistent Volume (PV) Provisioning Using OpenStack Manila (Technology Preview)

This feature is currently in xref:ocp-311-technology-preview[Technology Preview]
and not for production workloads.

{product-title} is capable of provisioning PVs using the
link:https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Manila[OpenStack Manila] shared file system
service.

See
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_manila.adoc#persistent_storage_manila[Persistent
Storage Using OpenStack Manila] for more information.

[[ocp-311-pv-resize]]
==== Persistent Volume (PV) Resize

You can expand PV claims online from {product-title} for GlusterFS by creating a storage class with `allowVolumeExpansion` set to `true`, which causes the following to happen:

. The PVC uses the storage class and submits a claim.
. The PVC specifies a new increased size.
. The underlying PV is resized.

Block storage volume types such as GCE-PD, AWS-EBS, Azure Disk, Cinder, and Ceph
RBD typically require a file system expansion before the additional space of an
expanded volume is usable by pods. Kubernetes takes care of this automatically
whenever the pod or pods referencing your volume are restarted.

Network attached file systems, such as GlusterFS and Azure File, can be expanded
without having to restart the referencing pod, as these systems do not require
unique file system expansion.

See
xref:../dev_guide/expanding_persistent_volumes.adoc#expanding_persistent_volumes[Expanding
Persistent Volumes] for more information.

[[ocp-311-tenant-driven-storage-snapshotting]]
==== Tenant-driven Storage Snapshotting (Technology Preview)

This feature is currently in xref:ocp-311-technology-preview[Technology Preview]
and not for production workloads.

Tenants can now leverage the underlying storage technology backing the PV
assigned to them to make a snapshot of their application data. Tenants can also
now restore a given snapshot from the past to their current application.

You can use an external provisioner to access EBS, GCE pDisk, and hostPath. This
Technology Preview feature has tested EBS and hostPath. The tenant must stop the
pods and start them manually.

To use the external provisioner to access EBS and hostPath:

. The administrator runs an external provisioner for the cluster. These are images from the Red Hat Container Catalog.
. The tenant creates a PV claim and owns a PV from one of the supported storage solutions.
. The administrator must create a new `StorageClass` in the cluster, for example:
+
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: snapshot-promoter
provisioner: volumesnapshot.external-storage.k8s.io/snapshot-promoter
----

. The tenant creates a snapshot of a PV claim named `gce-pvc`, and the resulting
snapshot is `snapshot-demo`, for example:
+
----
$ oc create -f snapshot.yaml

apiVersion: volumesnapshot.external-storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshot
metadata:
  name: snapshot-demo
  namespace: myns
spec:
  persistentVolumeClaimName: gce-pvc
----

. The pod is restored to that snapshot, for example:
+
----
$ oc create -f restore.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: snapshot-pv-provisioning-demo
  annotations:
    snapshot.alpha.kubernetes.io/snapshot: snapshot-demo
spec:
  storageClassName: snapshot-promoter
----

[[ocp-311-scale]]
=== Scale

[[ocp-311-scale-cluster-maximums]]
==== Cluster Maximums

Updated guidance around
xref:../scaling_performance/cluster_maximums.adoc#scaling-performance-cluster-maximums[Cluster
Maximums] for {product-title} 3.11 is now available.

*New recommended guidance for master*

For large or dense clusters, the API server might get overloaded because of the
default queries per second (QPS) limits. Edit
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* and double or quadruple the QPS
limits.

See
xref:../scaling_performance/host_practices.adoc#scaling-performance-capacity-host-practices-master[Recommended
Practices for OpenShift Container Platform Master Hosts] for more information.

[[ocp-311-scaling-the-cluster-monitoring-operator]]
==== Scaling the Cluster Monitoring Operator

{product-title} exposes metrics that can be collected and stored in backends by
the
link:https://github.com/openshift/cluster-monitoring-operator[*cluster-monitoring-operator*].
As an {product-title} administrator, you can view system resources, containers,
and component's metrics in one dashboard interface, Grafana.

In {product-title} 3.11, the cluster monitoring operator installation is enabled
by default as `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=true` in your cluster.  You can
update this by setting `openshift_cluster_monitoring_operator_node_selector` in
the inventory file of your customized node selector.Ensure there is an available
node in your cluster to avoid unexpected failures.

See
xref:../scaling_performance/scaling_cluster_monitoring.adoc#scaling-performance-cluster-monitoring[Scaling
Cluster Monitoring Operator] for capacity planning details.

[[ocp-311-metrics-and-logging]]
=== Metrics and Logging

[[ocp-311-prometheus]]
==== Prometheus Cluster Monitoring

Prometheus cluster monitoring is now fully supported in {product-title} and deployed by default into an {product-title} cluster.

* Query and plot cluster metrics collected by Prometheus.
* Receive notifications from pre-packaged alerts, enabling owners to take corrective actions and start troubleshooting problems.
* View pre-packaged Grafana dashboards for etcd, cluster state, and many other aspects of cluster health.

See xref:../install_config/prometheus_cluster_monitoring.adoc#prometheus-cluster-monitoring[Configuring Prometheus Cluster Monitoring] for more information.

[[ocp-311-elasticsearch-5-kibana-5]]
==== Elasticsearch 5 and Kibana 5

Elasticsearch 5 and Kibana 5 are now available. Kibana dashboards can be saved
and shared between users. Elasticsearch 5 introduces better resource usage and
performance and better resiliency.

Additionally, new numeric types, `half_float` and `scaled_float` are now added.
There are now instant aggregations in Kibana 5, making it faster. There is also
a new API that returns an explanation of why Elasticsearch shards are unassigned.

[[ocp-311-developer-experience]]
=== Developer Experience

[[ocp-311-cli-plug-ins]]
==== CLI Plug-ins (Technology Preview)

This feature is currently in xref:ocp-311-technology-preview[Technology Preview]
and not for production workloads.

Usually called _plug-ins_ or _binary extensions_, this feature allows you to
extend the default set of `oc` commands available and, therefore, allows you to
perform new tasks.

See xref:../cli_reference/extend_cli.adoc#cli-reference-extend-cli[Extending the
CLI] for information on how to install and write extensions for the CLI.

[[ocp-311-configure-build-trigger-without-triggering-immediately]]
==== Configure a Build Trigger Behavior without Triggering a Build Immediately

You can pause an image change trigger to allow multiple changes on the
referenced image stream before a build is started. You can also set the `paused`
attribute to `true` when initially adding an `ImageChangeTrigger` to a
`BuildConfig` to prevent a build from being immediately triggered.

See
xref:../dev_guide/builds/triggering_builds.adoc#image-change-trigger[Triggering
Builds] for more information.

[[ocp-311-more-flexibility-providing-configuration-options-to-builds-using-configmaps]]
==== More Flexibility in Providing Configuration Options to Builds Using ConfigMaps

In some scenarios, build operations require credentials or other configuration
data to access dependent resources, but it is undesirable for that information
to be placed in source control. You can define _input secrets_ and _input
ConfigMaps_ for this purpose.

See xref:../dev_guide/builds/build_inputs.adoc#dev-guide-build-inputs[Build
Inputs] for additional details.

[[ocp-311-kubectl]]
==== kubectl

{product-title} always shipped
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/[kubectl] for Linux on
the master’s file system, but it is now available in the
link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290[`oc` client downloads].


[[ocp-311-registry]]
=== Registry

[[ocp-311-accessing-and-configuring-red-hat-registry]]
==== Accessing and Configuring the Red Hat Registry

All container images available through the Red Hat Container Catalog are hosted
on an image registry, `registry.access.redhat.com`. The Red Hat Container
Catalog is moving from `registry.access.redhat.com` to `registry.redhat.io`. The
new registry, `registry.redhat.io`, requires authentication for access to images
and hosted content on {product-title}. Following the move to the new registry,
the existing registry will be available for a period of time.

See xref:../install_config/configuring_red_hat_registry.adoc#install-config-configuring-red-hat-registry[Authentication Enabled Red Hat Registry]
for more information.


[[ocp-311-quay]]
=== Quay

[[ocp-311-red-hat-quay-registries]]
==== Red Hat Quay Registries
If you need an enterprise quality container image registry, Red Hat Quay is
available both as a hosted service and as software you can install in your own
data center or cloud environment. Advanced registry features in Red Hat Quay
include geo-replication, image scanning, and the ability to roll back images.
Visit the link:https://quay.io[Quay.io] site to set up your own hosted Quay
registry account.

See
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-image-registry[Container
Registry] for more information.

[[ocp-311-networking]]
=== Networking

[[ocp-311-kuryr]]
==== Improved {product-title} and Red Hat OpenStack Integration with Kuryr

See xref:../admin_guide/kuryr.adoc#admin-guide-kuryr[Kuryr SDN Administration]
and
xref:../install_config/configuring_kuryrsdn.adoc#install-config-configuring-kuryr-sdn[Configuring
Kuryr SDN] for best practices in {product-title} and Red Hat OpenStack
integration.

[[ocp-311-haproxy-enhancements]]
==== Router (HAProxy) Enhancements

The {product-title} router is the most common way to get traffic into the cluster. The table below lists the {product-title} router (HAProxy) enhancements for 3.11.

.Router (HAProxy) enhancements
|===
|Feature |Feature enhancements |Command syntax

|HTTP/2
|Implements HAProxy router HTTP/2 support (terminating at the router).
|`$ oc set env dc/router ROUTER_ENABLE_HTTP2=true`

|Performance
|Increases the number of threads that can be used by HAProxy to serve more routes.
a| . Scale down the default router and create a new router using two threads:
+
----
$ oc scale dc/router --replicas=0
$ oc adm router myrouter --threads=2 --images='openshift3/ose-haproxy-router:v3.x'
----
. Set a new thread count (for, example `7`) for the HAProxy router:
+
----
$ oc set env dc/myrouter ROUTER_THREADS=7
----

|Dynamic changes
|Implements changes to the HAProxy router without requiring a full router reload.
|`$ oc set env dc/router ROUTER_HAPROXY_CONFIG_MANAGER=true`

|Client SSL/TLS cert validation
|Enables mTLS for route support of older clients/services that do not support
SNI, but where certificate verification is a requirement.
|`$ oc adm router myrouter --mutual-tls-auth=optional --mutual-tls-auth-ca=/root/ca.pem --images="$image"`

|Logs captured by aggregated logging/EFK
|Collects access logs so that Operators can see them.
a| . Create a router with an rsyslog container:
+
----
$ oc adm router myrouter --extended-logging --images='xxxx'
----
. Set the log level:
+
----
$ oc set env dc/myrouter ROUTER_LOG_LEVEL=debug
----
. Check the access logs in the rsyslog container:
+
----
$ oc logs -f myrouter-x-xxxxx -c syslog
----
|===

[[ocp-311-ha-namespace-wide-egress-ip]]
==== HA Namespace-wide Egress IP

Adding basic active/backup HA for project/namespace egress IPs now allows a namespace to have multiple egress IPs hosted on different cluster nodes.

To add basic active/backup HA to an existing project/namepace:

. Add two or more egress IPs to its `netnamespace`:
+
----
$ oc patch netnamespace myproject -p '{"egressIPs":["10.0.0.1","10.0.0.2"]}'
----

. Add the first egress IP to a node in the cluster:
+
----
# oc patch hostsubnet node1 -p '{"egressIPs":["10.0.0.1"]}'
----

. Add the second egress IP to a different node in the cluster:
+
----
# oc patch hostsubnet node2 -p '{"egressIPs":["10.0.0.2"]}'
----

The project/namespace uses the first listed egress IP by default (if available) until that node stops responding, upon which other nodes switch to using the next listed egress IP, and so on. This solution requires greater than or equal to two IPs.

If the original IP eventually comes back, the nodes switch back to using the original egress IP.

See xref:../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#enabling-static-ips-for-external-project-traffic[Enabling Static IPs for External Project Traffic] for more information.

[[ocp-311-fully-automatic-namespace-wide-egress-ip]]
==== Fully-automatic Namespace-wide Egress IP

A fully-automatic HA option is now available. Projects/namespaces are
automatically allocated a single egress IP on a node in the cluster, and that IP
is automatically migrated from a failed node to a healthy node.

To enable the fully-automatic HA option:

. Patch one of the cluster nodes with the `egressCIDRs`:
+
----
# oc patch hostsubnet node1 -p '{"egressCIDRs":["10.0.0.0/24"]}'
----

. Create a project/namespace and add a single egress IP to its `netnamespace`:
+
----
# oc patch netnamespace myproject -p '{"egressIPs":["10.0.0.1"]}'
----

[[ocp-311-configurable-vxlan-port]]
==== Configurable VXLAN Port

The {product-title} SDN overlay VXLAN port is now configurable (default is
`4789`). VMware modified the VXLAN port used in the VMware NSX SDN (≥v6.2.3) from `8472` to `4789` to adhere to link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7348[RFC 7348].

When running the {product-title} SDN overlay on top of VMware's NSX SDN underlay, there is a port conflict since both use the same VXLAN port (`4789`). With a configurable VXLAN port, users can choose the port configuration of the two products, used in combination, for their particular environment.

To configure the VXLAN port:

. Modify the VXLAN port in *_master-config.yaml_* with the new port number (for example, `4889` instead of `4789`):
+
----
vxlanPort: 4889
----

. Delete `clusternetwork` and restart the master API and controller:
+
----
$ oc delete clusternetwork default
$ master-restart api controllers
----

. Restart all SDN pods in the `openshift-sdn` project:
+
----
$ oc delete pod -n openshift-sdn -l app=sdn
----

. Allow the new port on the firewall on all nodes:
+
----
# iptables -i OS_FIREWALL_ALLOW -p udp -m state --state NEW -m udp --dport 4889 -j ACCEPT
----

[[ocp-311-master]]
=== Master

[[ocp-311-pod-priority-and-preemption]]
==== Pod Priority and Preemption

You can enable pod priority and preemption in your cluster. Pod priority
indicates the importance of a pod relative to other pods and queues the pods
based on that priority. Pod preemption allows the cluster to evict, or preempt,
lower-priority pods so that higher-priority pods can be scheduled if there is no
available space on a suitable node. Pod priority also affects the scheduling
order of pods and out-of-resource eviction ordering on the node.

See
xref:../admin_guide/scheduling/priority_preemption.adoc#admin-guide-priority-preemption[Pod
Priority and Preemption] for more information.

[[ocp-311-the-descheduler]]
==== The Descheduler (Technology Preview)

This feature is currently in xref:ocp-311-technology-preview[Technology Preview]
and not for production workloads.

The descheduler moves pods from less desirable nodes to new nodes. Pods can be
moved for various reasons, such as:

* Some nodes are under- or over-utilized.
* The original scheduling decision does not hold true any more, as taints or
labels are added to or removed from nodes, pod/node affinity requirements are
not satisfied any more.
* Some nodes failed and their pods moved to other nodes.
* New nodes are added to clusters.

[[ocp-311-node-problem-detector]]
==== Node Problem Detector (Technology Preview)

This feature is currently in xref:ocp-311-technology-preview[Technology Preview]
and not for production workloads.

The Node Problem Detector monitors the health of your nodes by finding specific problems and reporting these problems to the API server, where external
controllers could take action. The Node Problem Detector is a daemon that runs
on each node as a DaemonSet. The daemon tries to make the cluster aware of node
level faults that should make the node not schedulable. When you start the Node
Problem Detector, you tell it a port over which it should broadcast the issues
it finds. The detector allows you to load sub-daemons to do the data collection.
There are three as of today. Issues found by the problem daemon can be
classified as `NodeCondition`.

The three problem daemons are:

* Kernel Monitor, which monitors the kernel log via journald and reports problems according to regex patterns.
* AbrtAdaptor, which monitors the node for kernel problems and application crashes from journald.
* CustomerPluginMonitor, which allows you to test for any condition and exit on a `0` or `1` should your condition not be met.

See
xref:../admin_guide/node_problem_detector.adoc#admin-guide-node-problem-detector[Node
Problem Detector] for more information.

[[ocp-311-cluster-autoscaling]]
==== Cluster Autoscaling (AWS Only)

You can configure an auto-scaler on your {product-title} cluster in Amazon Web
Services (AWS) to provide elasticity for your application workload. The
auto-scaler ensures that enough nodes are active to run your pods and that the
number of active nodes is proportional to current demand.

See

[[ocp-311-cluster-admin-console]]
==== Cluster Administrator Console

{product-title} 3.11 introduces a cluster administrator console tailored toward
application development and cluster administrator personas.

Users have a choice of experience based on their role or technical abilities, including:

* An administrator with Containers as a Service (CaaS) experience and with heavy exposure to Kubernetes.
* An application developer with Platform as a Service (PaaS) experience and standard {product-title} UX.

Sessions are not shared across the consoles, but credentials are.

See
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-the-admin-console[Configuring
Your Inventory File] for details on configuring the cluster console.

[[ocp-311-visibility-into-nodes]]
==== Visibility into Nodes

{product-title} now has an expanded ability to manage and troubleshoot cluster nodes, for example:

* Node status events are extremely helpful in diagnosing resource pressure and
other failures.
* Runs *node-exporter* as a DaemonSet on all nodes, with a default set of scraped metrics from the *kube-state-metrics* project.
* Metrics are protected by RBAC.
* Those with *cluster-reader* access and above can view metrics.

[[ocp-311-containers-as-a-service]]
==== Containers as a Service
You can view, edit, and delete the following Kubernetes objects:

* Networking
** Routes and ingress
* Storage
** PVs and PV claims
** Storage classes
* Admin
** Projects and namespaces
** Nodes
** Roles and RoleBindings
** CustomResourceDefinition (CRD)

[[ocp-311-access-control-management]]
==== Access Control Management

{product-title} 3.11 includes visual management of the cluster’s RBAC roles and RoleBindings, which allows you to:

* Find users and service accounts with a specific role.
* View cluster-wide or namespaced bindings.
* Visually audit a role’s verbs and objects.

Project administrators can self-manage roles and bindings scoped to their namespace.

[[ocp-311-cluster-wide-event-stream]]
==== Cluster-wide Event Stream

The cluster-wide event stream provides the following ways to help debug events:

* All namespaces are accessible by anyone who can list the namespaces and events.
* Per-namespace is accessible for all project viewers.
* There is an option to filter by category and object type.

[[ocp-311-control-sharing-pid-namespace-between-containers]]
==== Control Sharing the PID Namespace Between Containers (Technology Preview)

This feature is currently in xref:ocp-311-technology-preview[Technology Preview]
and not for production workloads.

You can use this feature to configure cooperating containers in a pod, such as a
log handler sidecar container, or to troubleshoot container images that do not
include debugging utilities like a shell, for example:

* The feature gate `PodShareProcessNamespace` is set to `false` by default.
* Set `feature-gates=PodShareProcessNamespace=true` in  the API server,
controllers, and kubelet.
* Restart the API server, controller, and node service.
* Create a pod with the specification of `shareProcessNamespace: true`.
* Run `oc create -f <pod spec file>`.

*Caveats*

When the PID namespace is shared between containers:

* Sidecar containers are not isolated.
* Environment variables are visible to all other processes.
* Any `kill all` semantics used within the process are broken.
* Any `exec` processes from other containers show up.

[[ocp-311-github-enterprise-added-as-auth-Provider]]
==== GitHub Enterprise Added as Auth Provider

GitHub Enterprise is now an auth provider. OAuth facilitates a token
exchange flow between {product-title} and GitHub or GitHub Enterprise. You can
use the GitHub integration to connect to either GitHub or GitHub Enterprise. For
GitHub Enterprise integrations, you must provide the `hostname` of your instance
and can optionally provide a `ca` certificate bundle to use in requests to the
server.

Authentication and User Agent] for more information.

[[ocp-311-sspi-connection-support-on-windows]]
==== SSPI Connection Support on Microsoft Windows (Technology Preview)

This feature is currently in xref:ocp-311-technology-preview[Technology Preview]
and not for production workloads.

`oc` now supports the Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) to allow for
single sign-on (SSO) flows on Windows. If you use the request header identity
provider with a GSSAPI-enabled proxy to connect an Active Directory server to
{product-title}, users can automatically authenticate to {product-title} using
the `oc` command line interface from a domain-joined Windows computer.

[[ocp-311-red-hat-openshift-service-mesh]]
==== Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh (Technology Preview)

This feature is currently in xref:ocp-311-technology-preview[Technology Preview] and not for production workloads.

Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh is a platform that provides behavioral insights and operational control over the service mesh, providing a uniform way to connect, secure, and monitor microservice applications.

The term service mesh is often used to describe the network of microservices that make up applications based on a distributed microservice architecture and the interactions between those microservices. As a service mesh grows in size and complexity, it can become harder to understand and manage.

Based on the open source link:https://istio.io/[Istio] project, Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh layers transparently onto existing distributed applications, without requiring any changes in the service code.

[NOTE]
====
Installation on OpenShift 3.11 is no longer available. To allow for an increased frequency in features and fixes, OpenShift Service Mesh maintains a release cadence independent from the OpenShift minor version release stream. Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh has been generally available in a supported version since OpenShift 4.1.

== Notable Technical Changes

{product-title} 3.11 introduces the following notable technical changes.

[discrete]
[[ocp-311-cluster-scoped]]
==== subjectaccessreviews.authorization.openshift.io and resourceaccessreviews.authorization.openshift.io Are Cluster-scoped Only

*_subjectaccessreviews.authorization.openshift.io_* and
*_resourceaccessreviews.authorization.openshift.io_* are now cluster-scoped
only. If you need namespace-scoped requests, use
*_localsubjectaccessreviews.authorization.openshift.io_* and
*_localresourceaccessreviews.authorization.openshift.io_*.

[discrete]
[[ocp-311-scc-new-options]]
==== New SCC options

*No new privs flag*

Security Context Constraints have two new options to manage use of the (Docker)
`no_new_privs` flag to prevent containers from gaining new privileges:

* The `AllowPrivilegeEscalation` flag gates whether or not a user is allowed to set the security context of a container.
* The `DefaultAllowPrivilegeEscalation` flag sets the default for the `allowPrivilegeEscalation` option.

For backward compatibility, the `AllowPrivilegeEscalation` flag defaults to
`allowed`. If that behavior is not desired, this field can be used to default to
`disallow`, while still permitting pods to request `allowPrivilegeEscalation`
explicitly.

*Forbidden and unsafe sysctls options*

Security Context Constraints have two new options to control which sysctl
options can be defined in a pod spec:

* The `forbiddenSysctls` option excludes specific sysctls.
* The `allowedUnsafeSysctls` option controls specific needs such as high performance or real-time application tuning.

All safe sysctls are enabled by default; all unsafe sysctls are disabled by
default and must be manually allowed by the cluster administrator.

[[ocp-311-new-storage-driver]]
==== New Storage Driver Recommendation

Red Hat strongly recommends
xref:../scaling_performance/optimizing_storage.adoc#choosing-a-graph-driver[using
the overlayFS storage driver instead of Device Mapper]. For better performance,
use overlayfs2 for Docker engine or overlayFS for CRI-O. Previously, we
recommended using Device Mapper.

[[ocp-311-bug-fixes]]
== Bug Fixes

This release fixes bugs for the following components:

*Builds*

* ConfigMap Build Sources allows you to use ConfigMaps as a build source, which
is transparent and easier to maintain than secrets. ConfigMaps can be injected
into any OpenShift build.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1540978[*BZ#1540978*])

* Information about out of memory (OOM) killed build pods is propagated to a
build object. This information simplifies debugging and helps you discover what went wrong if appropriate failure reasons are described to the user. A build controller populates the status reason and message correctly when a build pod is OOM killed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1596440[*BZ#1596440*])

* The logic for updating the build status waited to update the log snippet
containing the tail of the build log only ran after the build status changed to
the failed state. The build would first transition to a failed state, then get
updated again with the log snippet. This means code watching for the build to
enter a failed state would not see the log snippet value populated initially.
The code is now changed to populate the log snippet field when the build
transitions to failed status, so the build update will contain both the failed
state and the log snippet. Code that watches the build for a transition to the
failed state will see the log snippet as part of the update that transitioned
the build to failed, instead of seeing a subsequent update later.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1596449[*BZ#1596449*])

* If a job used the `JenkinsPipelineStrategy` build strategy, the prune settings
were ignored. As a result, setting `successfulBuildsHistoryLimit` and
`failedBuildsHistoryLimit` did not correctly prune older jobs. The code has been changed to prune jobs properly.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1543916[*BZ#1543916*])

*Cloud Compute*

* You can now configure NetworkManager for `dns=none` during installation. This configuration is commonly used when deploying {product-title} on Microsoft Azure, but can also be useful in other scenarios. To configure this, set `openshift_node_dnsmasq_disable_network_manager_dns=true`.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1535340[*BZ#1535340*])

*Image*

* Previously, because of improper handling of empty image stream updates, updates to an image stream that did not result in a change in tags resulted in a request to the image import API that included no content to be imported, which was invalid and lead to errors in the controller. Now, updates to the image stream that result in no new or updated tags that need to be imported will not result in an import API call. With this fix, invalid requests do not go to the import API, and no errors occur in the controller.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1613979[*BZ#1613979*])

* Image pruning stopped on encountering any unexpected error while deleting blobs. In the case of an image deletion error, image pruning failed to remove any image object from etcd. Images are now being pruned concurrently in separated jobs. As a result, image pruning does not stop on a single unexpected blob deletion failure.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1567657[*BZ#1567657*])

*Installer*

* When deploying to AWS, the `build_ami` play failed to clean *_/var/lib/cloud_*. An unclean *_/var/lib/cloud_* directory causes cloud-init to skip execution. Skipping execution causes a newly deployed node to fail to bootstrap and auto-register to {product-title}. This bug fix cleans the *_/var/lib/cloud_* directory during `seal_ami` play.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1599354[*BZ#1599354*])

* The installer now enables the router's extended route validation by default.
This validation performs additional validation and sanitation of routes' TLS
configuration and certificates. Extended route validation was added to the
router in {product-title} 3.3 and enhanced with certificate sanitation in
{product-title} 3.6. However, the installer did not previously enable extended
route validation. There was initial concern that the validation might be too
strict and reject valid routes and certificates, so it was disabled by default.
But it has been determined to be safe to enable by default on new installs. As a
result, extended route validation is enabled by default on new clusters. It
can be disabled using by setting
`openshift_hosted_router_extended_validation=False` in the Ansible inventory.
Upgrading an existing cluster does *not* enable extended route validation.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1542711[*BZ#1542711*])

* Without the fully defined *_azure.conf_* file when a load balancer service was
 requested through {product-title}, the load balancer would never fully register
 and provide the external IP address. Now the *_azure.conf_*, with all the
 required variables, allows the load balancer to be deployed and provides the
 external IP address.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1613546[*BZ#1613546*])

* To facilitate using CRI-O as the container-runtime for {product-title}, update the *_node-config.yaml_* file with the correct endpoint settings. The
`openshift_node_groups` defaults have been extended to include CRI-O variants
for each of the existing default node groups. To use the CRI-O runtime for a
group of compute nodes, use the following inventory variables:
+
** `openshift_use_crio=True`
** `openshift_node_group_name="node-config-compute-crio"`
+
Additionally, to deploy the Docker garbage collector, `docker gc`, the following
variable must be set to `True`. This bug fix changes the previous variable default value from `True` to `False`:
+
** `openshift_crio_enable_docker_gc=True`
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1615884[*BZ#1615884*])

* The *_ansible.cfg_* file distributed with `openshift-ansible` now sets a default log path of *_~/openshift-ansible.log_*. This ensures that logs are written in a predictable location by default. To use the distributed *_ansible.cfg_* file, you must first change directories to
*_/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible_* before running Ansible playbooks. This
*_ansible.cfg_* file also sets other options meant to increase the performance
and reliability of `openshift-ansible`.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1458018[*BZ#1458018*])

* Installing Prometheus in a multi-zone or region cluster using dynamic storage
provisioning causes the Prometheus pod to become unschedulable in some cases.
The Prometheus pod requires three physical volumes: one for the Prometheus
server, one for the Alertmanager, and one for the alert-buffer. In a multi-zone cluster with dynamic storage, it is possible that one or more of these volumes becomes allocated in a different zone than the others. This causes the Prometheus pod to become unschedulable due to each node in the cluster only able to access physical volumes in its own zone. Therefore, no node can run the Prometheus pod and access all three physical volumes. The recommended solution is to create a storage class which restricts volumes to a single zone using the `zone:` parameter, and assigning this storage class to the Prometheus volumes using the Ansible installer inventory variable,
`openshift_prometheus_<COMPONENT>_storage_class=<zone_restricted_storage_class>`. With this workaround, all three volumes get created in the same zone or
region, and the Prometheus pod is automatically scheduled to a node in the
same zone.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1554921[*BZ#1554921*])

*Logging*

* Previously, the `openshift-ansible installer` only supported `shared_ops` and
`unique` as Kibana index methods. This bug fix allows users in a non-ops EFK
cluster to share the default index in Kibana, to share queries, dashboards, and
so on. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1608984[*BZ#1608984*])

* As part of installing the ES5 stack, users need to create a *_sysctl_* file for the nodes that ES runs on. This bug fix evaluates which nodes/Ansible hosts to run the tasks against.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1609138[*BZ#1609138*])

* Additional memory is required to support Prometheus metrics and retry queues to avoid periodic restarts from out-of-the-box memory. This bug fix increases
out-of-the-box memory for Fluentd. As a result, Fluentd pods avoid
out-of-the-box memory restarts.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1590920[*BZ#1590920*])

* Fluentd will now reconnect to Elasticsearch every 100 operations by default. If one Elasticsearch starts before the others in the cluster, the load balancer in the Elasticsearch service will connect to that one and that one only, and so will all of the Fluentd connecting to Elasticsearch. With this enhancement, by having Fluentd reconnect periodically, the load balancer will be able to spread the load evenly among all of the Elasticsearch in the cluster.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1489533[*BZ#1489533*])

* The rubygem ffi 1.9.25 reverted a patch, which allowed it to work on systems
with SELinux `deny_execmem=1`. This cases Fluentd to crash. This bug fix reverts
the patch reversion and, as a result, Fluentd does not crash when using SELinux
`deny_execmem=1`.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1628407[*BZ#1628407*])

*Management Console*

* The log viewer was not accounting for multi-line or partial line responses. If a response contained a multi-line message, it was appended and treated as a single line, causing the line numbers to be incorrect. Similarly, if a partial line were received, it would be treated as a full line, causing longer log lines sometimes to be split into multiple lines, again making the line count incorrect. This bug fix adds logic in the log viewer to account for multi-line and partial line responses. As a result, line numbers are now accurate.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1607305[*BZ#1607305*])

*Monitoring*

* The `9100` port was blocked on all nodes by default. Prometheus could not scrape the `node_exporter` service running on the other nodes, which listens on port `9100`. This bug fix modifies the firewall configuration to allow incoming TCP traffic for the `9000` - `1000` port range. As a result, Prometheus can now scrape the `node_exporter` services.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1563888[*BZ#1563888*])

* `node_exporter` starts with the `wifi` collector enabled by default. The `wifi` collector requires SELinux permissions that are not enabled, which causes AVC denials though it does not stop `node_exporter`. This bug fix ensures
`node_exporter` starts with the `wifi` collector being explicitly disabled. As a
result, SELinux no longer reports AVC denials.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1593211[*BZ#1593211*])

* Uninstalling Prometheus currently deletes the entire `openshift-metrics`
namespace. This has the potential to delete objects which have been created in
the same namespace but are not part of the Prometheus installation. This bug fix changes the uninstall process to delete only the specific objects which were created by the Prometheus install and delete the namespace if there are no remaining objects, which allows Prometheus to be installed and uninstalled while sharing a namespace with other objects.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1569400[*BZ#1569400*])

*Pod*

* Previously, a Kubernetes bug caused `kubectl drain` to stop when pods returned
an error. With the
link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64896[Kubernetes fix], the
command no longer hangs if pods return an error.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1586120[*BZ#1586120*])

*Routing*

* Because dnsmasq was exhausting the available file descriptors after the
OpenShift Extended Comformance Tests and the Node Vertical Test, dnsmasq
was hanging and new pods were not being created. A change to the code increases
the maximum number of open file descriptors so the node can pass the tests.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1608571[*BZ#1608571*])

* If 62 or more IP addresses are specified using an
`haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist` annotation on a route, the router
will error due to exceeding the maximum parameters on the command (63). The
router will not reload. The code was changed to use an
overflow map if the there are too many IPs in the whitelist annotation and pass
the map to the HA-proxy ACL.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1598738[*BZ#1598738*])

* By design, using a route with several services, when configuring a service with `set route-backend` set to `0`, the weight would drop all existing connections and associated end user connections. With this bug fix, a value of `0` means the server will not participate in load-balancing but will still accept persistent connections.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1584701[*BZ#1584701*])

* Because the liveness and readiness probe could not differentiate between a pod
that was alive and one that was ready, a router with `ROUTER_BIND_PORTS_AFTER_SYNC=true` was reported as failed. This bug fix splits the liveness and readiness probe into separate probes, one for readiness and one for liveness. As a result, a router pod can be alive but not yet ready.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1550007[*BZ#1550007*])

* When the HAproxy router contains a large number of routes (10,000 or more), the router will not pass the liveness and Readiness due to low performance, which kills the router repeatedly. The root cause of this issue is likely that a
health check cannot be completed within the default readiness and liveness
detection cycle. To prevent this problem, increase the interval of the probes.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1595513[*BZ#1595513*])

*Service Broker*

* The deprovision process for Ansible Service Broker was not deleting secrets from the *openshift-ansible-service-broker* project. With this bug fix, the code was changed to delete all associated secrets upon Ansible Service Broker deprovisioning.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1585951[*BZ#1585951*])

* Previously, the broker's reconciliation feature would delete its image
references before getting the updated information from the registry, and there
would be a period before the records appeared in the broker's data store
while other jobs were still running. The reconciliation feature was redesigned
to do an in-place update for items that have changed. For items removed from the registry, the broker deletes only those not already provisioned. It will also mark those items for deletion, which filters them out of the UI, preventing future provisions of those items. As a result, the broker’s reconciliation feature makes provisioning and deprovisioning more resilient to registry changes.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1577810[*BZ#1577810*])

* Previously, users would see an error message when an item was not found, even if
it is normal not to be found. As a result, successful jobs might have an error
message logged, causing the user concern that there might be a problem when
there was none. The logging level of the message has now been changed from `error` to `debug`, because the message is still useful for debugging purposes, but not useful for a production installation, which usually has the level set to `info` or higher. As a result, users will not see an error message when the instance is not found unless there was an actual problem.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1583587[*BZ#1583587*])

* If the cluster is not running or is not reachable, the `svcat version` command resulted in an error. The code has been changed to always report the client version, and if the server is reachable, it then reports the server version.

* In some scenarios, using the `svcat deprovision <service-instance-name> --wait` command sometimes resulted in the `svcat` command terminating with a panic error. When this happened, the `deprovision` command got executed, and the program then encountered a code bug when attempting to wait for the instance to be fully deprovisioned. This issue is now resolved.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1595065[*BZ#1595065*])

*Storage*

* Previously, because the kubelet system containers could not write to the
*_/var/lib/iscsi_* directory, iSCSI volumes could not be attached. Now, you can
mount the host *_/var/lib/iscsi_* into the kubelet system container so that
iSCSI volumes can be attached.

[[ocp-311-known-issues]]
== Known Issues

* Due to a change in the authentication for the Kibana web console, you must log
back into the console after an upgrade and every 168 hours after initial login.
The Kibana console has migrated to *oauth-proxy*.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1614255[*BZ#1614255*])

* A Fluentd dependency on a systemd library is not releasing file handles.
Therefore, the host eventually runs out of file handles. As a workaround,
periodically recycle Fluentd to force the process to release unused file
handles. See link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3958661[Resolving Fluentd
journald File Locking Issues] for more information on resolving this issue.

[[ocp-3-11-43]]
=== RHBA-2018:3537 - {product-title} 3.11.43 Bug Fix and Enhancement Update

Issued: 2018-11-19

{product-title} release 3.11.43 is now available. The list of packages and
bug fixes included in the update are documented in the
link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018:3537[RHBA-2018:3537] advisory.
The container images included in the update are provided by the
link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018:3536[RHBA-2018:3536] advisory.

Space precluded documenting all of the bug fixes and enhancements for this
release in the advisory. See the following sections for notes on upgrading and
details on the bug fixes and enhancements included in this release.

[[ocp-3-11-43-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* Log messages from a CRI-O pod could be split in the middle by nature. As a
result, partial log messages were indexed in the Elasticsearch. The newer
fluent-plugin-concat supports merging the CRI-O style split messages into one,
which is not available for the current fluentd (v0.12) that {product-title}
logging v3.11 uses. The functionality was backported to the fluentd v0.12. With
this bug fix, the CRI-O style split log messages are merged back to the original
full message.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1552304[*BZ#1552304*])

* The event router intentionally generated duplicate event logs as to not lose
them. The `elasticsearch_genid` plug-in is now extended to `elasticsearch_genid_ext` so
that it takes the `alt_key` and `alt_tag`. If a log message has a tag matched the
`alt_tag` value, it uses the `alt_key` value as the Elasticsearch primary key. You
could specify a field, which is shared among the duplicate events to `alt_key`,
which eliminates the duplicate events from the Elasticsearch.
+
Sample filter using `elasticsearch_genid_ext`:
+
----
        @type elasticsearch_genid_ext
        hash_id_key viaq_msg_id
        alt_key kubernetes.event.metadata.uid
        alt_tags "#{ENV['GENID_ALT_TAG'] || 'kubernetes.var.log.containers.kube-eventrouter-*.** kubernetes.journal.container._default_.kubernetes.event'}"
      </filter>
----
+
With this bug fix, no duplicate event logs are indexed in Elasticsearch.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1613722[*BZ#1613722*])


* The Netty dependency does not make efficient use of the heap. Therefore,
Elasticsearch begins to fail on the network layer at a high logging volume. With
this bug fix, the Netty recycler is disabled and Elasticsearch is more efficient
in processing connections.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1627086[*BZ#1627086*])

* The installer did not parameterize the configmap used by the Elasticsearch pods.
The operations Elasticsearch pods used the configmap of the non-operations
Elasticsearch pods. Parameterize the template used by the installer so that the
pods use the `logging-es-ops` configmap.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1627689[*BZ#1627689*])

* When using docker with the journald log driver, all container logs, including
system and plain docker container logs, are logged to the journal, and read by
fluentd. Consequently, fluentd does not know how to handle these non-Kubernetes
container logs and throws exceptions. Treat non-Kubernetes container logs as
logs from other system services (for example, send them to the operations
index). Logs from non-Kubernetes containers are now indexed correctly and do not
cause any errors.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1632364[*BZ#1632364*])

* When using docker with log-driver journald, the setting in
*_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* has changed to use `--log-driver` journald instead of
`--log-driver=journald`. Fluentd cannot detect that journald is being used, so
assumes `json-file`, and cannot read any Kubernetes metadata because it does not
look for the journald `CONTAINER_NAME` field.  This results in a lot of fluentd
errors. Change the way Fluentd detects the docker log driver so that it looks
for `--log-driver` journald in addition to `--log-driver=journald`. Fluentd can
now detect the docker log driver, and can correctly process Kubernetes container
logs.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1632648[*BZ#1632648*])

* When fluentd is configured as the combination of collectors and MUX, event logs
from the event were supposed to be processed by MUX, not by the collector for
the both `MUX_CLIENT_MODE` maximal and minimal. This is because if an event log
is formatted in the collector (and the event record is put under the Kubernetes
key), the log is forwarded to MUX and passed to the k8s-meta plug-in there and
the existing Kubernetes record is overwritten. It wiped out the event
information from the log.
+
*Fix 1*:
To avoid the replacement, if the log is from event router, the tag is rewritten
to `${tag}.raw` in *_input-post-forward-mux.conf_*, which makes the log treated
in the `MUX_CLIENT_MODE=minimal way`.
+
*Fix 2*:
There was another bug in Ansible. That is, the environment variable
`TRANSFORM_EVENTS` was not set in MUX even if
`openshift_logging_install_eventrouter` is set to `true`.
+
With these two bug fixes, the event logs are correctly logged when MUX is
configured with `MUX_CLIENT_MODE=maximal` as well as minimal.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1632895[*BZ#1632895*])

* In {product-title} 3.10 and newer, the API server runs as a static pod and only
mounted *_/etc/origin/master_* and *_/var/lib/origin_* inside that pod. CAs
trusted by the host were not trusted by the API server. The API server pod
definition now mounts *_/etc/pki_* into the pod. The API server now trusted all
certificate authorities trusted by the host including those defined by the
installer variable `openshift_additional_ca`. This can be used to import image
streams from a registry verified by a private CA.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1641657[*BZ#1641657*])

* The OSB Client Library used by the Service Catalog controller pod was not
closing and freeing TCP connections used to communicate with brokers. Over a
period of time, many TCP connections would remain open and eventually the
communication between the Service Catalog controller and brokers would fail.
Additionally, the pod would become unresponsive. Reuse the TCP connection when
using the OSB Client Library.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1641796[*BZ#1641796*])

* An unnecessarily short timeout resulted in a failure to reuse artifacts from a
previous build when incremental builds were selected with S2I. This could occur
when the size of the artifacts being reused was particularly large or the host
system was running particularly slowly. Invalid artifacts could be used in a
subsequent build, or artifacts would be recreated instead of reused resulting in
performance degradation. With this bug fix, the timeout is increased to a
sufficiently large value to avoid this problem. Artifact reuse should no longer
timeout.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1642350[*BZ#1642350*])

* The Automation Broker always created a network policy to give the transient
namespace access to the target namespace. Adding a network policy to a namespace
that does not have any other network policies in place causes the namespace to
be locked down to the newly created policy. Before the network policy,
everything was open and namespaces could communicate with each other. The
Automation Broker now looks to see if there are any network policies in place
for the target namespace. If there are none, the broker will not create a new
network policy. The broker will assume that things are open enough to allow the
transient namespace we create to communicate with the target namespace. The
broker will still create a network policy giving the transient namespace access
to the target namespace, if there are other network policies in place for the
target namespace. This bug fix allows the broker to perform the APB actions
without affecting existing services running on the target namespace.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1643301[*BZ#1643301*])

* Previously, the cluster console in {product-title} 3.11 would always show the
value `0` for the crashlooping pods count on the cluster status page, even when
there were crashlooping pods. The problem is now fixed and the count now
accurately reflects the count for the selected projects.

Space precluded documenting all of the bug fixes and enhancements for this
release in the advisory. See the following sections for notes on upgrading and
details on the bug fixes and enhancements included in this release.

[[ocp-3-11-59-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* The openshift-ansible OpenStack playbook defaulted to the Kuryr-Kubernetes
multi-pool driver, but that functionality was not merged on stable/queens
kuryr-controller. This bug fix adds the option to select the pool driver to use
for versions older than stable/queens. For newer versions, it will suffice with
setting the `kuryr_openstack_pool_driver` to `multi` as described in the
documentation.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1573128[*BZ#1573128*])

* The Openshift Ansible installer did not check if any CNS are created before
creating a security group. It would create a security group for CNS even when
there were none created. The Openshift Ansible installer now checks that
`openshift_openstack_num_cns` is greater than zero before creating a security
group for CNS. CNS security groups are now only created when there is at least
one CNS created.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1613438[*BZ#1613438*])

* The ability to leave swap enabled is now removed and the
`openshift_disable_swap` variable is deprecated. This variable was never
publicly documented and was only used internally. Documentation has stated that
system swap should be disabled since version 3.4.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1623333[*BZ#1623333*])

* An incorrect `etcdctl` command was used during etcd backup for system
containers, causing the etcd backup to fail during upgrade. The etcd system
container is now identified correctly. The upgrade succeeds with etcd in the
system container.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1625534[*BZ#1625534*])

* During etcd scaleup, facts about the etcd cluster are required in order to add
new hosts. The necessary tasks are now added to ensure those facts are set
before configuring new hosts and, therefore, allow the scale-up to complete as
expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1628201[*BZ#1628201*])

* The default log format for audit was set to `json`. The audit log was always
printed using JSON format. You can now set the log format as specified in the
*_master-config.yaml_* file. The audit log now contains values per the
configured log format.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1632155[*BZ#1632155*])

* `sync daemonset` did not run on all nodes. The pgrade failed, as some nodes did
not have an annotation set. With this bug fix, `sync daemonset` now tolerates
all taints and runs on all nodes and the upgrade succeeds.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1635462[*BZ#1635462*])

* `sync daemonset` did not wait a sufficient amount of time for nodes to restart.
The sync DS verification task failed, as nodes did not come up in time. A number
of retries was increased and the install or upgrade now succeeds.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1636914[*BZ#1636914*])

* A deployment would take longer than some of the infrastructure or API
server-related timeouts. Long-running deployments would fail. The deployer is
now fixed to tolerate long running deployments by re-establishing the watch.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1638140[*BZ#1638140*])

* Ansible 2.7.0 changed the way variables were passed to roles. Some roles did not
have necessary variables set, resulting in a failed installation. The required
Ansible version is now set to 2.6.5 and the installation succeeds.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1638699[*BZ#1638699*])

* Node, pod, and control-plane images were not pre-pulled when CRI-O was used.
Tasks timed out, as they included pull time. Images are now pre-pulled when
Docker and CRI-O are used and the installation succeeds.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1639201[*BZ#1639201*])

* The scale-up playbooks, when used in conjunction with Calico, did not properly
configure the Calico certificate paths causing them to fail. The playbooks have
been updated to ensure that master scale-up with Calico works properly.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1644416[*BZ#1644416*])

* In some cases, CRI-O was restarted before verifying that the image pre-pull was
finished. Images were not pre-pulled. Now, CRI-O is restarted before image
pre-pull begins and installation succeeds.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1647288[*BZ#1647288*])

* The CA was not copied to the master config directory when GitHub Enterprise was
used as a identity provider. The API server failed to start without a CA. New
variables, `openshift_master_github_ca` and `openshift_master_github_ca_file`,
were introduced to set the GitHub Enterprise CA and installation now succeeds.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1647793[*BZ#1647793*])

* The *curator* image was built with the wrong version of the
*python-elasticsearch* package and the *curator* image would not start. Use the
correct version of the *python-elasticsearch* package to build the *curator*
image and the *curator* image works as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1648453[*BZ#1648453*])

* There was improper evaluation of a user's Kibana index. A minor upgrade in
server version caused an error when the expected configuration object was not as
expected. Its reation was skipped due to the existence of kibana index. Remove a
user's Kiana index, evaluate the stored version against the Kibana version, and
recreate the configuration object if necessary. With this bug fix, users will no
longer see the error.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1652224[*BZ#1652224*])

* Egress IP-related iptables rules were not recreated if they were deleted. If a
user restarted *firewalld* or *iptables.service* on a node that hosted egress
IPs, then those egress IPs would stop working. Traffic that should have used the
egress IP would use the node's normal IP instead. Egress IP iptables rules are
now recreated if they are removed. Egress IPs now work reliably.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1653380[*BZ#1653380*])

* A bug in earlier releases of *cluster-logging* introduced Kibana index-patterns
where the title was not properly replaced and was left with the placeholder of
`'$TITLE$'`. As a result, the user sees a permission error of *no permissions for
[indices:data/read/field_caps]*. Remove all index-patterns that have the
bad data, either by upgrading or running:
+
----
$ oc exec -c elasticsearch -n $NS $pod --es_util \
--query=".kibana.*/_delete_by_query?pretty" -d \
"{\"query\":{\"match\":{\"title\":\"*TITLE*\"}}}"
----
+
With this bug fix, the permission error is no longer generated.

==== Enhancements

* A new playbook was added to cleanup etcd2 data If the cluster was upgraded from
{product-title} 3.5, it might still carry etcd2 data and use up space. The new
playbook safely removes etcd2 data.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1514487[*BZ#1514487*])

* A new multi-pool driver is added to Kuryr-Kubernetes to support hybrid
environments where some nodes are bare metal while others are running inside
VMs, therefore having different pod VIF drivers (e.g., *neutron* and *nested-vlan*).
To make use of this new feature, the available configuration mappings for the
different pools and *pod_vif* drivers need to be specified in the *kuryr.conf*
configmap. In addition, the nodes must be annotated with the correct
information about the *pod_vif* to be used. Otherwise, the default one is used.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1553070[*BZ#1553070*])

* Scale out Ansible playbooks for the OpenStack deployed clusters are now adeded.
When installing OpenShift on top of OpenStack with the OpenStack provisioning
playbooks (`playbooks/openstack/openshift-cluster/provision_install.yml`),
scaling the cluster out required several manual steps such as writing the
inventory by hand and running two extra playbooks. This was more brittle,
required more complex documentation, and did not match the initial deployment
experience. To scale out OpenShift on OpenStack, your can now change the desired
number of nodes and run one of the following playbooks (depending on whether you
want to scale the worker or master nodes):
+
----
playbooks/openstack/openshift-cluster/node-scaleup.yml
playbooks/openstack/openshift-cluster/master-scaleup.yml
----
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1566424[*BZ#1566424*])

* Define the recreate strategy timeout for Elasticsearch. There are examples on
AWS OpenShift clusters where rollout of new Elasticsearch pods fail because the
cluster is having issues attaching storage. Defining a long recreate timeout
allows the cluster more time to attach storage to the new pod. Elasticsearch
pods have more time to restart and experience fewer rollbacks.

release in the advisory. See the following sections for notes on upgrading and
details on the bug fixes and enhancements included in this release.

[[ocp-3-11-69-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* The location of the master proxy API changed. Since the MetricsApiProxy
diagnostic uses this endpoint, it broke. The diagnostic was updated to look at
the correct endpoint and it should now work as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1632983[*BZ#1632983*])

* Pods would not schedule because they did not have free ports. This issue is now
resolved.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1647674[*BZ#1647674*])

* Bootstrap v3.3.5 contains a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The
management console does not allow user input to be displayed via a data-target
attribute. Upgrade Bootstrap to v3.4.0, which fixes the vulnerability. With this
bu fix, the management console is not longer at risk of possible exploit via the
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Bootstrap v3.3.5.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1656438[*BZ#1656438*])

* Improper error checking ignored errors from object creation during template
instantiation. Template instances would report successful instantiation when
some objects in the template failed to be created. Errors on creation are now
properly checked and the template instance will report failure if any object
within it cannot be created.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1662339[*BZ#1662339*])

* The rsync package was removed from the registry image, so rsync cannot be used
to backup content from the registry container. The rsync package is now added
back to the image and can now be used.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1664853[*BZ#1664853*])

[[ocp-3-11-69-enhancements]]
==== Enhancements

* This enhancement ensures that OpenShift-on-OpenStack playbook execution will
fail at the prerequisites check if the public net ID is not configured when the
Kuryr SDN is used.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1579414[*BZ#1579414*])

* You can now control the assignment of floating IP addresses for OpenStack cloud
provisioning. The playbook responsible for creating the OpenStack virtual
servers would always associate a floating IP address with each virtual machine
(each OpenShift node). This had two negative implications:
+
. The OpenShift cluster size was limited by the number of floating IPs available to the OpenStack user.
. All OpenShift nodes were directly accessible from the outside, increasing the potential attack surface.
+
A role-based control over which nodes get floating IPs and which do not is now
introduced. This is controlled by the following inventory variables:
+
* `openshift_openstack_master_floating_ip`
* `openshift_openstack_infra_floating_ip`
* `openshift_openstack_compute_floating_ip`
* `openshift_openstack_load_balancer_floating_ip`
+
They are all boolean and all default to `true`. This allows for use cases such as:
+
* A cluster where all the master and infra nodes have floating IPs but the compute
nodes do not.
* A cluster where none of the nodes have floating IPs, but the load balancers do
(so OpenShift is used through the load balancers, but none of the nodes are
directly accessible).
+
If some of the nodes do not have floating IPs (by setting
`openshift_openstack_compute_floating_ip = false`), the openshift-ansible
playbooks must be run from inside the node network. This is because a server
without a floating IP is only accessible from the network it is in. A common way
to do this is to pre-create the node network and subnet, create a "bastion" host
in it, and run Ansible there:
+
----
$ openstack network create openshift
$ openstack subnet create --subnet-range 192.168.0.0/24 --dns-nameserver 10.20.30.40 --network openshift openshift
$ openstack router create openshift-router
$ openstack router set --external-gateway public openshift-router
$ openstack router add subnet openshift-router openshift
$ openstack server create --wait --image RHEL7 --flavor m1.medium --key-name openshift --network openshift bastion
$ openstack floating ip create public
$ openstack server add floating ip bastion 172.24.4.10
$ ping 172.24.4.10
$ ssh cloud-user@172.24.4.10
----
+
Then, install openshift-ansible and add the following to the inventory
(*_inventory/group_vars/all.yml_*):
+
----
openshift_openstack_node_network_name: openshift
openshift_openstack_router_name: openshift-router
openshift_openstack_node_subnet_name: openshift
openshift_openstack_master_floating_ip: false
openshift_openstack_infra_floating_ip: false
openshift_openstack_compute_floating_ip: false
openshift_openstack_load_balancer_floating_ip: false

release in the advisory. See the following sections for notes on upgrading and
details on the bug fixes and enhancements included in this release.

[[ocp-3-11-82-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* All Docker related packages are not removed during the uninstall process.Docker is not re-installed properly during installation, causing Docker CLI tasks to fail. With this bug fix, all related Docker packages to uninstall are now added. Re-installation succeeds after running the uninstall playbook.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1635254[*BZ#1635254*])

* Polling of quotas resulted in undesirable toast notifications. Now, quota polling errors are suppressed and users no longer see these notifications.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1651090[*BZ#1651090*])

* Previously, running the install playbook multiple times with no changes to the cluster console configuration could cause the cluster console login to stop working. The underlying problem has been fixed, and now running the playbook more than once will correctly roll out a new console deployment. This problem can be worked around without the installer fix by manually deleting the console pods using the command:
+
----
$ oc delete --all pods -n openshift-console
----
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1651632[*BZ#1651632*])

* Certain certificate expiry check playbooks did not call properly initialization functions resulting in an error. Those playbooks have been updated to avoid this problem.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1655183[*BZ#1655183*])

* The OpenShift SDN/OVS DaemonSets were upgraded during control plane
upgrades with an `updateStrategy` of `RollingUpdate`, an upgrade of the
pods in the entire cluster was performed. This caused unexpected network
and application outages on nodes. This bug changed the `updateStrategy` for
SDN/OVS pods to `OnDelete` in the template, affecting only new
installations. Control plane upgrade tasks were added to modify SDN/OVS
daemonsets to use `OnDelete` `updateStrategy`. Node upgrade tasks were
added to delete all SDN/OVS pods while nodes are drained. Network outages
for nodes should only occur during the node upgrade when nodes are drained.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1657019[*BZ#1657019*])

* Previously, the 3.11 admin console did not correctly display whether a storage class was the default storage class, as it was checking an out-of-date annotation value. The admin console has been updated to use the `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class=true` annotation, and service classes are now properly marked as default when that value is set.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1659976[*BZ#1659976*])

* A changed introduced in Kubernetes 1.11 affected nodes with many IP addresses in `vSphere` deployments. Under vSphere, a node hosting several `Egress IPs` or `Router HA` addresses would sporadically lose IP addresses and start using one of the other ones, causing networking problems. Now, if a `node IP` is specified in the node configuration, it will be used correctly, regardless of how many other IP addresses are assigned to the node.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1666820[*BZ#1666820*])

* A type error in the OpenStack code prevented installation on OpenShift nodes without floating IP addresses. This error has been corrected, and installation proceeds as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1667270[*BZ#1667270*])

* Certain certificate expiry check playbooks did not call initialization functions properly, resulting in an error. Those playbooks have been updated to avoid this issue.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1667618[*BZ#1667618*])

* The cluster role `system:image-pruner` was required for all DELETE
requests to the registry. As a result, the regular client could not cancel
its uploads, and the `S3 multipart` uploads were accumulating. Now, the
cluster role `system:image-pruner` will accept DELETE requests for uploads
from clients who are allowed to write into them.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1668412[*BZ#1668412*])

* If the specified router certificate, key, or CA did not end with a new line character, the router deployment would fail. A new line is now appended to each of the input files ensuring this problem doesn't occur.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1668970[*BZ#1668970*])

* The `volume-config.yaml was not copied to `/etc/origin/node`. As a result, volume quotas were not observed, so local storage size was not limited. Now, the `volume-config.yaml` is copied to `/etc/origin/node`. Volume quotas are observed and local storage size is limited by setting `openshift_node_local_quota_per_fsgroup` in the inventory.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1669555[*BZ#1669555*])

*  `oc` image mirror failed with error `tag: unexpected end of JSON input` when attempting to mirror images from Red Hat registry. This was a result of commits from a dependency were dropped from the product build. The commits have been re-introduced, and the command can now parse the output successfully, as well as mirror from the Red Hat registry.

release in the advisory. See the following sections for notes on upgrading and
details on the bug fixes and enhancements included in this release.

[[ocp-3-11-98-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* Administrative users were not able to access the cluster endpoints because permissions were defined incorrectly. Now, the correct permissions have been defined, and administrative users can use the `_cat` endpoints.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1548640[*BZ#1548640*])

* Image garbage collection failed to remove an image correctly if it has only one tag but more than one repository associated with the image. This has now been resolved and garbage collection completes successfully.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1647348[*BZ#1647348*])

* The `docker` registry Health Check would fail if the bucket was empty on AWS S3 environments, returning a `PathNotFound` message. Now, `PathNotFound` is treated as a success and Health Check works as expected for empty buckets.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1655641[*BZ#1655641*])

* Playbooks ran a check to see if images existed on the disk with specific version tags, but did not ensure the version on the disk was up-to-date to the tagged image in the repo, resulting in skipping the z-stream image pulls, and z-stream upgrades would fail. Now, the on-disk check has been removed, and image pulls are efficient so that there is no need to check whether the image exists on the disk prior to downloading.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1658387[*BZ#1658387*])

* Health Check playbooks would fail at checking `Elasticsearch` because the exec call would not specify a container. The call failed because the output included incorrectly formatted JSON text. Now, the target container is included in the `exec` call and the Health Check succeeds.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1660956[*BZ#1660956*])

* An error in `glusterfs` pod mount points prevented the use of `gluster-block`. As a result, the provisioner would fail to create devices. The mount points have now been updated and the provisioning process succeeds as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1662312[*BZ#1662312*])

* The `openshift-ansible` package was incorrectly checking if a value in the `etcd-servers-overrides` was a valid path. Some values were considered invalid by the `openshift-ansible-3.11.51-2.git.0.51c90a3.el7.noarch` package. Now, `etcd-servers-overrides` does not contain paths, and is ignored during path checks.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1666491[*BZ#1666491*])

* `etcd` non-master host nodes were excluded from upgrades. Now, `etcd` host nodes are able to be upgraded.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1668317[*BZ#1668317*])

* The Ansible variable `openshift_master_image_policy_allowed_registries_for_import` was incorrectly parsed, causing a corrupted `master-config.yaml` file. Now, the `openshift_master_image_policy_allowed_registries_for_import`
variable is correctly parsed and a simple registry image policy can be set as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1670473[*BZ#1670473*])

* The playbooks and manual configuration steps to redeploy router certificates were replaced with service serving certificates secret. This would overwrite or miss the router wild certificates secret, causing certificate errors due to incorrect certificates redeployed. Now, the playbooks and manual redeployment steps do not overwrite router certificates secret. The router certificates are redeployed based on the specified sub domain or customer certificates.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1672011[*BZ#1672011*])

* The `ImageStream` used in the `BuildConfig` editor did not have edit properties, causing runtime errors in the `BuildConfig` editor. Now, the editor is initializing tags and objects, even if `ImageStream` in the `BuildConfig` is missing or if the user does not have the correct permissions to use it.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1672904[*BZ#1672904*])

* Master pods did not match time zones with worker nodes, which led to errors in logging timestamps. Now, the host's timezone configuration is mounted into the control plane pods.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1674170[*BZ#1674170*])

* When a cluster was installed, the user name in the loopback kubeconfig is the same as the host name of the master. Now, the variable in the playbook is changed to a different value.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1675133[*BZ#1675133*])

* The Ansible Health Check playbook failed when checking the `curator` status. This occurred because the Health Check assumed `curator` is a `DeploymentConfig` instead of a `cronjob`, resulting in a failed check. Now, Health Check properly evaluates for a `cronjob` instead of a `DeploymentConfig`.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1676720[*BZ#1676720*])

* Some namespaces would be missing from `oc get projects` if more than 1,000 projects were listed. Now, all items correctly appear when looking at large resource lists.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1677545[*BZ#1677545*])

* High network latency existed between `Kibana` and `Elasticsearch` due to either network issues or under-allocated memory for `Elasticsearch`. As a result, `Kibana` would be unusable because of a gateway timeout. Now, changes are backported from `Kibana` version 6, which allows modification to the ping timeout. Administrators are not able to override the default `pingTimeout` of 3000ms by setting the `ELASTICSEARCH_REQUESTTIMEOUT` environment variable. `Kibana` is functional until the underlying network issues or under-allocated memory conditions can be resolved.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1679159[*BZ#1679159*])

* The `deafultIndex` in the `Kibana` config entry was null, causing the seeding process to fail and the user was presented with a white screen. Now, the `defaultIndex` value is evaluated and returns to the default screen if there is a null value. The `Kibana` seeding process completes successfully.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1679613[*BZ#1679613*])

* Previously, the upgrade process for `CRI-O` would attempt to stop `docker` on nodes that had been configured to only run `CRI-O`, resulting in playbook failures. Now, the playbook does not stop `docker` on nodes that are configured only for `CRI-O` operation, ensuring successful upgrades.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1685072[*BZ#1685072*])

* Using `MERGE_JSON_LOG=true` would create fields in the record that would cause syntax violations or create too many fields in `Elasticsearch`, causing severe performance problems. Now, users who experience these problems can tune `fluentd` to accommodate their log record fields without errors or `Elasticsearch` performance degradation.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1685243[*BZ#1685243*])

* The SSL and TLS service uses Diffie-Hellman groups with insufficient strength (a key size less than 2048 bytes). As a result, the keys are more vulnerable. Now, the key strength has been increased and certificates are more secure.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1685618[*BZ#1685618*])

* The `fluentd` daemonset did not include a `tolerate everything` toleration. If a node became tainted, the `fluentd` pod would get evicted. Now, a `tolerate everything` toleration has been added, and `fluentd` pods do not get evicted.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1685970[*BZ#1685970*])

* Upgrade playbooks ran several `oc` commands that used resource aliases that may not be immediately available after a restart or other reasons. Now, the `oc` suite of commands uses the fully qualified resource name to avoid potential failure.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1686590[*BZ#1686590*])

* The files that implemented log rotation functionality were not copied to the correct `fluentd` directory. As a result, logs were not being rotated. Now, the container build has been changed to inspect the `fluentd` gem to find out where to install the files. The files that implement log rotation are copied to the correct directory for `fluentd` usage.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1686941[*BZ#1686941*])


[[ocp-3-11-98-enhancements]]
==== Enhancements

* The command `oc label --list` is now added, and now shows the resource and name of all the labels.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1268877[*BZ#1268877*])

* This enhancement allows the AWS cloud provider to parse additional endpoint configuration and customization of both core Kubernetes and cluster autoscaler environments. AWS now allows custom and private regions, which do not follow the conventions of their public cloud endpoints. {product-title} deployments were limited to the public AWS cloud regions only, and this limited the adoption of the product in these scenarios. Additional configuration elements can be added to the `aws.conf` file and will be honored by {product-title} as well as the `cluster-autoscaler` to ensure the correct cloud endpoints are used to automatically provision EBS volumes, load balancers, and EC2 instances.

=== RHBA-2019:1605 - {product-title} 3.11.117 Bug Fix Update

Issued: 2019-06-26

{product-title} release 3.11.117 is now available. The list of packages and
bug fixes included in the update are documented in the
link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2019:1605[RHBA-2019:1605] advisory.

[NOTE]
====
Release 3.11.117 contains the `openshift-ansible` package with a later version
of 3.11.123. This is expected and does not affect cluster operation. More
details can be found in https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4265171[this Red Hat Solution].

[[ocp-3-11-117-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* The `oc create route dry-run -o yaml` command would not output a route object.
This has been resolved by implementing the printing of the route object to the
command line.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1418021[*BZ#1418021*])

* Some `.operations` index projects were given a value of `default openshift-`.
This has now been changed to `kube-system`.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1571190[*BZ#1571190*])

* On a director-deployed OpenShift environment, the GlusterFS playbooks
auto-generate a new heketi secret key for each run. As a result of this,
operations such as scale out or configuration changes on CNS deployments fail.
As a workaround, complete the following steps:

. Post-deployment, retrieve the heketi secret key. Use this command on one of the master nodes:
+
----
$ sudo oc get secret heketi-storage-admin-secret --namespace glusterfs -o json | jq -r .data.key | base64 -d
----
+
. In an environment file, set the following parameters to that value:
+
----
  openshift_storage_glusterfs_heketi_admin_key
  openshift_storage_glusterfs_registry_heketi_admin_key
----
+
As a result of this workaround, operations such as scale out or configuration
changes on CNS deployments work as long as the parameters were manually
extracted.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1640382[*BZ#1640382*])

* When a new CA was generated, the certificates on the nodes were not updated and
would not become ready. Now, the redeploy-certificates playbook will copy the
certificates and join nodes. Nodes no longer go to a `NotReady` state when
replacing the CA.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1652746[*BZ#1652746*])

* The oc_adm_router Ansible module allowed edits to add duplicate environment
variables to the router DeploymentConfig. An Ansible inventory file that
specified edits to the router DeploymentConfig that added duplicate environment
variables could produce a DeploymentConfig with unpredictable behavior. If an
edit appends an environment variable to the router DeploymentConfig, and a
variable by that name already exists, the oc_adm_router module now deletes the
old variable. Using an Ansible inventory file to append environment variables to
the router DeploymentConfig now has predictable behavior and allows users to
override default environment variable settings.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1656487[*BZ#1656487*])

* A playbook which redeployed master certificates did not update web console
secrets, causing the web console to fail to start. Now, web console secrets are
recreated when the master certificate redeployment playbook is run.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1667063[*BZ#1667063*])

* The logging playbooks did not work with Ansible 2.7.  The `include_role` and
`import_role` behavior changed between versions 2.6 and 2.7, which caused issues
with logging. As a result, errors with "-ops" suffixes would appear even when
not deploying with the ops cluster. To resolve this, use `include_role` instead
of `import_role` in logging playbooks and roles. The logging Ansible code works
on both Ansible 2.6 and Ansible 2.7.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1671315[*BZ#1671315*])

* Undesired DNS IP addresses were selected by the OpenShift service if
multiple network cards were present. As a result, DNS requests failed to
work from pods. Now, there are sane defaults present for DNS and it follows
a similar pattern used by kubelet to fetch routable node IP addresses.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1680059[*BZ#1680059*])

* Initialization during upgrades was slow. Sanity checks were using inefficient
code to validate host variables. This code has been updated and host variables
are now stored in the class. As a result, the host variables are not being
copied on every check. The sanity checks and initialization during upgrades
takes less time to complete.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1682924[*BZ#1682924*])

* The `oreg_url` variable would not function correctly on disconnected installs
using Satellite because the etcd image could not perform pulls on disconnected
installs. Now, guidance and examples have been added to specify the etcd image
URL issuing `osm_etcd_image` in the associated documentation.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1689796[*BZ#1689796*])

* If a build pod was evicted, the build reported a `GenericBuildFailure`.
Determining the cause of build failures was difficult as a result. Now a new
failure reason, `BuildPodEvicted`, has been added.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1690066[*BZ#1690066*])

* Nodes would sometimes panic due to cadvisor index reporting out of range errors.
This has now been resolved by a backporting of kube code.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1691023[*BZ#1691023*])

* ElasticSearch could not be monitored with Prometheus because the `oauth-proxy`
was not passing a user's token. Now, the token is exchanged to ElasticSearch and
users with proper roles can retrieve metrics in Prometheus.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1695903[*BZ#1695903*])

* Deploying nodes would fail in the `setup_dns.yaml` playbook during multi-node
setup. This was resolved by fixing the host name that was passed to the
`add_host` function. Now, multi-node setup proceeds as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1698922[*BZ#1698922*])

* Upgrading between minor versions would fail because several OpenShift variables
were not used during the upgrade process. Now, `api_port` and other
apiserver-related variables are read during the upgrade process and upgrades
complete successfully.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1699696[*BZ#1699696*])

* ElasticSearch would fail to start due to invalid certificate dates if hosts had
non-UTC timezones. When OpenShift nodes' timezone is not set to UTC, the
current non-UTC timestamp is used for the `NotBefore` checking. If the timezone
is ahead of UTC, the `NotBefore` checking would fail. Now, regardless of the
nodes' timezone, the UTC timestamp is set to the start date in the certificates
and failures are not reported due to non-UTC timestamps.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1702544[*BZ#1702544*])

* `CustomResourceDefinition` errors were presented in a confusing manner that made
troubleshooting difficult. Now, the CRD error messages have been clarified to
assist in troubleshooting CRD errors.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1702693[*BZ#1702693*])

* There was a missing `@` for an instance variable in the Fluentd remote
syslog plugin code. In some cases, systemd-journald logged errant values.
This resulted in rsyslog forwarding failures. Now, the variable has been
corrected and remote logging completes successfully.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1703904[*BZ#1703904*])

* Long running Jenkins agents and slave pods would experience defunct
process errors, causing a high number of processes to appear in process
listings until the pod is terminated. Now, `dumb-init` is deployed to clean
up these defunct processes.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1707448[*BZ#1707448*])

* The environment variable `JOURNAL_READ_FROM_HEAD` was set to an empty
string.  This caused the default value of `read_from_head` for the journald
input to be true.  When Fluentd starts up for the first time on a node, it
reads in the entire journal. This could result in hours of delays for
system messages to show up in ElasticSearch and Kibana. Now, Fluentd will
check if the value is set and is not empty, or will use the default value
of false. Fluentd will read from the tail of the journal when it starts on
a new node.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1707524[*BZ#1707524*])

* The script `99-origin-dns.sh` had a debug flag set to enabled, which would
log debug level messages by default. This has been resolved and debug is
now set to false.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1707799[*BZ#1707799*])

* Kubernetes pod templates were removed at random. This was because the OpenShift
Jenkins Sync plugin confused ImagesStreams and ConfigMaps with the same name
while processing them. An event for one type could delete the pod template
created for another type. The plugin has been modified to keep track of which
API object type created the pod template of a given name.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1709626[*BZ#1709626*])

* The `openshift_set_node_ip` variable was deprecated, but still included
in inventory example files. This has now been removed from example files
and code for the `openshift_set_node_ip` variable has been cleaned up.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1712488[*BZ#1712488*])

* Previously, the web console could show an incorrect "Scaling to..." value for
stateful sets in the project overview under some conditions. The stateful set
desired replicas value now correctly updates in the web console project
overview.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1713211[*BZ#1713211*])

* Previously, a service would not correctly show up in the project overview when
it selected the `DeploymentConfig` label that is automatically set for pods
created by a deployment config. Now, it correctly show services that select the
`DeploymentConfig` label on the overview.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1717028[*BZ#1717028*])

* The cluster autoscaler did not have the `clusterrole` permission to evict pods
and nodes would not be automatically scaled as a result. Now, eviction
permissions have been added to the autoscaler cluster role. Pods can be evicted
and nodes can be scaled down.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1718458[*BZ#1718458*])

* If a pod using an egress IP tried to contact an external host that was not
responding, the egress IP monitoring code may have mistakenly interpreted that
as meaning that the node hosting the egress IP was not responding.
High-availability egress IPs may have been switched from one node to another
spuriously. The monitoring code now distinguishes the case of "egress node not
responding" from "final destination not responding". High-availability egress
IPs will not be switched between nodes unnecessarily.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1718542[*BZ#1718542*])

* Refactoring of `openshift_facts` caused the MTU to be improperly set. Hosts
could not communicate on networks with non-default MTU settings. The
`openshift_facts.py` script was updated to properly detect and set the MTU for the
host environment. Hosts now can properly communicate on networks with
non-default MTU.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1720581[*BZ#1720581*])

[[ocp-3-11-117-enhancements]]
==== Enhancements

* The Cisco ACI CNI plugin is now available.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1708552[*BZ#1708552*])

* You can now use an Ansible playbook to perform a certificate rotation for the EFK
stack without needing to run the install/upgrade playbook. This playbook deletes
the current certificate files, generates new EFK certificates, updates
certificate secrets, and restarts ElasticSearch and Kibana.

link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2019:1754[RHBA-2019:1754] advisory.

[[ocp-3-11-129-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* In OpenShift on Azure environments, conditional arguments were missing that
would result in incorrect kubelet node names in certain cases. The conditionals
to set `nodeName` in `node-config` were added, and now kubelet names can be set
as required. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1656983[*BZ#1656983*])

* Health check playbooks would assume `Curator` was a `deploymentconfig` instead
of a `cronjob`, and would fail the check because the resource type had changed.
Now, the health check playbook properly evaluates for a `cronjob` instead of a
`deploymentconfig`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1676720[*BZ#1676720*])

* Some {product-title} installations would fail because the `selinux`
check was occurring in the `openshift_node` role instead of the `init` role.
Now, the `selinux` check occurs earlier in the installation process and is
completed successfully. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1710020[*BZ#1710020*])

* Access to the `ElasticSearch` root URL was denied from a project's pod in
{product-title} 3.11 instances that had been upgraded from version
3.10. This was due to strenuous permissions that denied non-administrative users
access to the root endpoints. Now, permissions have been changed so that all
users are able to access the root endpoints. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1710868[*BZ#1710868*])

* `ElasticSearch` metrics were unavailable in the `Prometheus` role. Now, the
`Prometheus` role has been enabled access to monitor all `ElasticSearch` indices.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1712423[*BZ#1712423*])

* `ImageStreams` would fail if not using a hosted managed registry due to an unset
`referencePolicy` field. Now, the dictionary has been changed to read and modify
the `referencePolicy` as needed, and `ImageStreams` can be used without a hosted
managed registry. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1712496[*BZ#1712496*])

* The `templateinstance` controller did not properly manage cluster level objects
in its create path, and as a result failed to create projects specified in
templates. Now, the `templateinstance` controller determines  if the objects in
its create path and passes correct values in secrets through namespaces. The
`templateinstance` can now create projects as defined in templates. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1713982[*BZ#1713982*])

* Redeployment of certificates did not recreate the `ansible-service-broker` pod
secrets, causing the service catalog to fail. A new playbook has been created to
support updating the certificates. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1715322[*BZ#1715322*])

* The IPv4 dictionary was recently modified and MTU was set incorrectly as a
result. This IPv4 conditional has been removed, and now MTU is established
correctly. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1719362[*BZ#1719362*])

* The `pom.xml` of some of the OpenShift Jenkins plugins had `http://` references
instead of `https://` references for some of its build time dependencies, and
dependency downloads would occur over `http` instead of the `https` protocol.
The `pom.xml` references have now been corrected and dependency downloads only
occur using the `https` protocol. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1719477[*BZ#1719477*])

* The readiness probe for `ElasticSearch` `curl` commands used `NSS`, which bloated
the dentry cache. This would cause `ElasticSearch` to become unresponsive. To
resolve this, set the `NSS_SDB_USE_CACHE=no` flag in the readiness probe to work
around the dentry cache bloating. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1720479[*BZ#1720479*])

* Previously, the web console showed a misleading warning that metrics might not
configured for horizontal pod autoscalers when only the metrics server had been
set up. The warning has been removed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1721428[*BZ#1721428*])

* Previously, the `image-signature-import` controller would only import up to
three signatures, but the registry would often have more than three signatures.
This would cause importing signatures to fail. The limit of signatures has been
increased, and importing signatures from `registry.redhat.io` completes
successfully. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1722581[*BZ#1722581*])

* The `prerequisites` playbook would fail because default values were not loaded
correctly, causing sanity checks to fail. A step to run `openshift_facts` has
been added to load all the default values, and sanity checks complete
successfully. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1724718[*BZ#1724718*])

* `Kibana` would present a blank page or timeout if a large number of projects
were creating too many calls to the `ElasticSearch` cluster, resulting in the
timeout before a response is returned. Now, API calls are cached and processing
is more efficient, reducing the opportunity for page timeouts. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1726433[*BZ#1726433*])

[[ocp-3-11-129-enhancements]]
==== Enhancements

* The service catalog did not have a `redeploy-certificate` playbook. The
certificates for the service catalog need to be rotated like other components of
OpenShift Container Platform, and a playbook has now been created for the
service catalog. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1702401[*BZ#1702401*])

==== Features

[[ocp-3-11-232-added-nodejs-jenkins-agent-v10-and-v12]]
===== Added Node.js Jenkins Agent v10 and v12

The `jenkins-agent-nodejs-10-rhel7` and `jenkins-agent-nodejs-12-rhel7` images
are now added to {product-title}. These new images allow Jenkins Pipelines to
be upgraded to use either v10 or v12 of the Node.js Jenkins Agent. The Node.js
v8 Jenkins Agent is now deprecated, but will continue to be provided. For
existing clusters, you must manually upgrade the Node.js Jenkins Agent, which
can be performed on a per namespace basis. Follow these steps to complete the
manual upgrade:

. Select the project for which you want to upgrade the Jenkins Pipelines:
+
----
$ oc project <project_name>
----

. Import the new Node.js Jenkins Agent image:
+
----
$ oc import-image nodejs openshift3/jenkins-agent-nodejs-10-rhel7 --from=registry.redhat.io/openshift3/jenkins-agent-nodejs-10-rhel7 --confirm
----
+
This command imports the v10 image. If you prefer v12, update the image
specifications accordingly.

. Overwrite the current Node.js Jenkins Agent with the new one you imported:
+
----
$ oc label is nodejs role=jenkins-slave --overwrite
----

. Verify in the Jenkins log that the new Jenkins Agent template is configured:
+
----
$ oc logs -f jenkins-1-<pod>
----

You can only get technical support for applications using the Node.js v8 Jenkins
Agent. For software maintenance support, you must upgrade to one of the
supported images. See xref:../using_images/other_images/jenkins_slaves.adoc#using-images-other-images-jenkins-slaves[Jenkins Agents]
for more information.

[[ocp-3-11-286-added-role-based-control-openstack-floating-IP-assignment]]
===== Added Role-Based Control for Floating IP Assignment in OpenStack

With this release, you can control the assignment of floating IP addresses for
OpenStack cloud provisioning.

Previously, the playbook responsible for creating OpenStack virtual servers
always associated a floating IP address with each VM that corresponded to an
{product-title} node. This behavior had the following consequences:

* The {product-title} cluster size was limited by the number of floating IP
addresses that are available to the OpenStack user.
* All {product-title} nodes were directly accessible from the outside,
increasing the potential attack surface.

To resolve these issues, this release introduces role-based controls to
determine whether a node is assigned a floating IP address. The behavior is
controlled by the following boolean inventory variables, which are set to `true`
by default:

* `openshift_openstack_master_floating_ip`
* `openshift_openstack_infra_floating_ip`
* `openshift_openstack_compute_floating_ip`
* `openshift_openstack_load_balancer_floating_ip`

The role-based controls allow for use cases such as:

* Clusters where the `master` and `infra` nodes have floating IP addresses, but
`compute` nodes do not.

* Clusters where none of the nodes have floating IP addresses, but the load
balancers do. In this configuration, {product-title} is used through the load
balancers, but none of the nodes are directly accessible.

A server without a floating IP address is only accessible from the network it is
in. If any nodes do not have floating IP addresses, then the `openshift-ansible`
playbooks must be run from inside the node network. A common way to use this
configuration is to precreate the node network and subnet, create a bastion host
in it, and run Ansible there.

.Example Steps to Create a Bastion Host
[source,terminal]
----
$ openstack network create openshift
$ openstack subnet create --subnet-range 192.168.0.0/24 --dns-nameserver \
 10.20.30.40 --network openshift openshift
$ openstack router create openshift-router
$ openstack router set --external-gateway public openshift-router
$ openstack router add subnet openshift-router openshift
$ openstack server create --wait --image RHEL7 --flavor m1.medium \
--key-name openshift --network openshift bastion
$ openstack floating ip create public
$ openstack server add floating ip bastion 172.24.4.10
$ ping 172.24.4.10
$ ssh cloud-user@172.24.4.10
----

After you create the bastion host, install `openshift-ansible` and add the
desired configuration to the `inventory/group_vars/all.yml` file:

.Example Inventory Configuration
[source,yaml]
----
openshift_openstack_node_network_name: openshift
openshift_openstack_router_name: openshift-router
openshift_openstack_node_subnet_name: openshift
openshift_openstack_master_floating_ip: false
openshift_openstack_infra_floating_ip: false
openshift_openstack_compute_floating_ip: false
openshift_openstack_load_balancer_floating_ip: false

=== RHSA-2021:2150 - {product-title} 3.11.452 bug fix and security update

Issued: 2021-06-09

{product-title} release 3.11.452 is now available. The list of packages and bug fixes included in the update are documented in the link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:2150[RHSA-2021:2150] advisory. The container images included in the update are provided by the link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2021:2149[RHBA-2021:2149] advisory.

[[ocp-3-11-452-bug-fix]]
==== Bug fix

* Previously, configuring `yum` to return multiple versions of a package led to upgrade failures. This fix adds the correct setting to the `repoquery` command. Now, upgrades succeed even when `yum` is configured to return multiple versions of a package. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1955012[*BZ#1955012*])

=== RHBA-2021:2928 - {product-title} 3.11.487 bug fix update

Issued: 2021-08-04

{product-title} release 3.11.487 is now available. The list of packages and bug fixes included in the update are documented in the link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2021:2928[RHBA-2021:2928] advisory. The container images included in the update are provided by the link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2021:2927[RHBA-2021:2927] advisory.

[[ocp-3-11-487-bug-fix]]
==== Bug fix

* Previously, for pods that used the `hostPort` definition to expose UDP ports to the host, the kubelet did not remove stale routing entries when a pod was deleted. As a result, those ports became unreachable when the pod was restarted. With this update, stale routing entries are removed, and the exposed UDP ports are reachable when the pods are restarted. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1946593[*BZ#1946593*])
