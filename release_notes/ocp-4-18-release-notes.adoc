== About this release

// TODO: Update with the relevant information closer to release.
{product-title} (link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:xxxx[RHSA-2024:xxxx]) is now available. This release uses link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.31.md[Kubernetes 1.31] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at https://console.redhat.com/openshift. From the {hybrid-console}, you can deploy {product-title} clusters to either on-premises or cloud environments.

// Double check OP system versions
{product-title} {product-version} is supported on {op-system-base-full} 8.8 and a later version of {op-system-base} 8 that is released before End of Life of {product-title} {product-version}. {product-title} {product-version} is also supported on {op-system-first}. To understand {op-system-base} versions used by {op-system}, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6907891[{op-system-base} Versions Utilized by {op-system-first} and {product-title}] (Knowledgebase article).

You must use {op-system} machines for the control plane, and you can use either {op-system} or {op-system-base} for compute machines. {op-system-base} machines are deprecated in {product-title} 4.16 and will be removed in a future release.
//Removed the note per https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GRPA-3517

//Even-numbered release lifecycle verbiage (Comment in for even-numbered releases)
Starting from {product-title} 4.14, the Extended Update Support (EUS) phase for even-numbered releases increases the total available lifecycle to 24 months on all supported architectures, including `x86_64`, 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), and {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architectures. Beyond this, Red{nbsp}Hat also offers a 12-month additional EUS add-on, denoted as _Additional EUS Term 2_, that extends the total available lifecycle from 24 months to 36 months. The Additional EUS Term 2 is available on all architecture variants of {product-title}. For more information about support for all versions, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

//Odd-numbered release lifecycle verbiage (Comment in for odd-numbered releases)
////
The support lifecycle for odd-numbered releases, such as {product-title} {product-version}, on all supported architectures, including `x86_64`, 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), and {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architectures is 18 months. For more information about support for all versions, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].
////

Commencing with the {product-title} 4.14 release, Red{nbsp}Hat is simplifying the administration and management of Red{nbsp}Hat shipped cluster Operators with the introduction of three new life cycle classifications; Platform Aligned, Platform Agnostic, and Rolling Stream. These life cycle classifications provide additional ease and transparency for cluster administrators to understand the life cycle policies of each Operator and form cluster maintenance and upgrade plans with predictable support boundaries. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/j/includes/session/scribe/?redirectTo=https%3A%2F%2Faccess.redhat.com%2Fsupport%2Fpolicy%2Fupdates%2Fopenshift_operators[OpenShift Operator Life Cycles].

// Added in 4.14. Language came directly from Kirsten Newcomer.
{product-title} is designed for FIPS. When running {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures.

For more information about the NIST validation program, see link:https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules[Cryptographic Module Validation Program]. For the latest NIST status for the individual versions of {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted for validation, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2918071#fips-140-2-and-fips-140-3-2[Compliance Activities and Government Standards].

crun is now the default container runtime for new containers created in {product-title}. The runC runtime is still supported and you can change the default runtime to runC, if needed. For more information on crun, see xref:../nodes/containers/nodes-containers-using.adoc#nodes-containers-runtimes[About the container engine and container runtime]. For information on changing the default to runC, see xref:../machine_configuration/machine-configs-custom.adoc#create-a-containerruntimeconfig_machine-configs-custom[Creating a ContainerRuntimeConfig CR to edit CRI-O parameters].

After updating from {product-title} 4.17.z to {product-title} {product-version}, the container runtime configured as the default is respected in {product-version}.

==== sigstore support (Technology Preview)

Available as a Technology Preview, you can use the sigstore project with {product-title} to improve supply chain security. You can create signature policies at the cluster-wide level or for a specific namespace. For more information, see xref:../nodes/nodes-sigstore-using.adoc#nodes-sigstore-using[Manage secure signatures with sigstore].

==== Read-only registry enhancements

In previous versions of {product-title}, storage mounted as read-only returned no specific metrics or information about storage errors. This could result in silent failures of a registry when the storage backend was read-only. With this release, the following alerts have been added to return storage information when the backend is set to read-only:

[cols="2", options="header"]
|===
| Alert Name | Message

| `ImageRegistryStorageReadOnly`
| The image registry storage is read-only and no images will be committed to storage.

| `ImageRegistryStorageFull`
| The image registry storage disk is full and no images will be committed to storage.

==== Cluster validation with the cluster-compare plugin

The `cluster-compare` plugin is an OpenShift CLI (`oc`) plugin that compares a cluster configuration with a target configuration. The plugin reports configuration differences while suppressing expected variations by using configurable validation rules and templates.

For example, the plugin can highlight unexpected differences, such as mismatched field values, missing resources, or version discrepancies, while ignoring expected differences, such as optional components or hardware-specific fields. This focused comparison makes it easier to assess cluster compliance with the target configuration.

You can use the `cluster-compare` plugin in development, production, and support scenarios.

For more information about the `cluster-compare` plugin, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/cluster-compare/understanding-the-cluster-compare-plugin.adoc#cluster-compare-overview_understanding-cluster-compare[Overview of the cluster-compare plugin].
[id="ocp-release-notes-node-tuning-operator-deferred-updates_{context}"]
==== Node Tuning Operator: Deferred Tuning Updates

In this release, the Node Tuning Operator introduces support for deferring tuning updates. Administrators can schedule updates to be applied during a maintenance window with this feature.

For more information, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/using-node-tuning-operator.adoc#defer-application-of-tuning-changes_node-tuning-operator[Deferring application of tuning changes].

== Known issues

* A regression in the behaviour of `libreswan` caused some nodes with IPsec enabled to lose communication with pods on other nodes in the same cluster. To resolve this issue, consider disabling IPsec for your cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-43713[*OCPBUGS-43713*])

[id="ocp-telco-ran-4-18-known-issues_{context}"]

* When you run Cloud-native Network Functions (CNF) latency tests on an {product-title} cluster, the test can sometimes return results greater than the latency threshold for the test; for example, 20 microseconds for `cyclictest` testing. This results in a test failure.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42328[*OCPBUGS-42328*])

[id="ocp-telco-core-4-18-known-issues_{context}"]

* Due to an issue with Kubernetes, the CPU Manager is unable to return CPU resources from the last pod admitted to a node to the pool of available CPU resources. These resources are allocatable if a subsequent pod is admitted to the node. However, this pod then becomes the last pod, and again, the CPU manager cannot return this pod's resources to the available pool.
+
This issue affects CPU load balancing features, which depend on the CPU Manager releasing CPUs to the available pool. Consequently, non-guaranteed pods might run with a reduced number of CPUs. As a workaround, schedule a pod with a `best-effort` CPU Manager policy on the affected node. This pod will be the last admitted pod and this ensures the resources will be correctly released to the available pool. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-17792[*OCPBUGS-17792*])

== Asynchronous errata updates

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for {product-title} {product-version} are released as asynchronous errata through the Red{nbsp}Hat Network. All {product-title} {product-version} errata is https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[available on the Red Hat Customer Portal]. See the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} Life Cycle] for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account settings for Red{nbsp}Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications are enabled, users are notified through email whenever new errata relevant to their registered systems are released.

[NOTE]
====
Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming {product-title} entitlements for {product-title} errata notification emails to generate.
====

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of {product-title} {product-version}. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form {product-title} {product-version}.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any {product-title} release, always review the instructions on xref:../updating/updating_a_cluster/updating-cluster-web-console.adoc#updating-cluster-web-console[updating your cluster] properly.
