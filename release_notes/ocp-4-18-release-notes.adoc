Red{nbsp}Hat {product-title} provides developers and IT organizations with a hybrid cloud application platform for deploying both new and existing applications on secure, scalable resources with minimal configuration and management. {product-title} supports a wide selection of programming languages and frameworks, such as Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and PHP.

Built on {op-system-base-full} and Kubernetes, {product-title} provides a more secure and scalable multitenant operating system for today's enterprise-class applications, while delivering integrated application runtimes and libraries. {product-title} enables organizations to meet security, privacy, compliance, and governance requirements.

== About this release

// TODO: Update with the relevant information closer to release.
{product-title} (link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:xxxx[RHSA-2024:xxxx]) is now available. This release uses link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.31.md[Kubernetes 1.31] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at https://console.redhat.com/openshift. With the {cluster-manager-first} application for {product-title}, you can deploy {product-title} clusters to either on-premises or cloud environments.

// Double check OP system versions
{product-title} {product-version} is supported on {op-system-base-full} 8.8 and a later version of {op-system-base} 8 that is released before End of Life of {product-title} {product-version}. {product-title} {product-version} is also supported on {op-system-first} {product-version}.

You must use {op-system} machines for the control plane, and you can use either {op-system} or {op-system-base} for compute machines. {op-system-base} machines are deprecated in {product-title} 4.16 and will be removed in a future release.
//Removed the note per https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GRPA-3517

//Even-numbered release lifecycle verbiage (Comment in for even-numbered releases)
Starting from {product-title} 4.14, the Extended Update Support (EUS) phase for even-numbered releases increases the total available lifecycle to 24 months on all supported architectures, including `x86_64`, 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), and {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architectures.
Beyond this, Red{nbsp}Hat also offers a 12-month additional EUS add-on, denoted as _Additional EUS Term 2_, that extends the total available lifecycle from 24 months to 36 months. The Additional EUS Term 2 is available on all architecture variants of {product-title}.

//Odd-numbered release lifecycle verbiage (Comment in for odd-numbered releases)
////
The support lifecycle for odd-numbered releases, such as {product-title} {product-version}, on all supported architectures, including `x86_64`, 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), and {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architectures is 18 months. For more information about support for all versions, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].
////

Commencing with the {product-title} 4.14 release, Red{nbsp}Hat is simplifying the administration and management of Red{nbsp}Hat shipped cluster Operators with the introduction of three new life cycle classifications; Platform Aligned, Platform Agnostic, and Rolling Stream. These life cycle classifications provide additional ease and transparency for cluster administrators to understand the life cycle policies of each Operator and form cluster maintenance and upgrade plans with predictable support boundaries. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/j/includes/session/scribe/?redirectTo=https%3A%2F%2Faccess.redhat.com%2Fsupport%2Fpolicy%2Fupdates%2Fopenshift_operators[OpenShift Operator Life Cycles].

// Added in 4.14. Language came directly from Kirsten Newcomer.
{product-title} is designed for FIPS. When running {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures.

For more information about the NIST validation program, see link:https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules[Cryptographic Module Validation Program]. For the latest NIST status for the individual versions of {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted for validation, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2918071#fips-140-2-and-fips-140-3-2[Compliance Activities and Government Standards].

== {product-title} layered and dependent component support and compatibility

The scope of support for layered and dependent components of {product-title} changes independently of the {product-title} version. To determine the current support status and compatibility for an add-on, refer to its release notes. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

=== Insights Operator
[id="ocp-release-notes-insights-operator-runtime-extractor_{context}"]
==== Insights Runtime Extractor (Technology Preview)

In this release, the Insights Operator introduces the workload data collection _Insights Runtime Extractor_ feature to help Red{nbsp}Hat better understand the workload of your containers.
Available as a Technology Preview, the Insights Runtime Extractor feature gathers runtime workload data and sends it to Red{nbsp}Hat.
Red{nbsp}Hat uses the collected runtime workload data to gain insights that can help you make investment decisions that will drive and optimize how you use your {product-title} containers.

The next minor release of {product-title} is expected to use Kubernetes 1.32. Kubernetes 1.32 removed a deprecated API.

See the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-32[Deprecated API Migration Guide] in the upstream Kubernetes documentation for the list of planned Kubernetes API removals.

See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6955985[Navigating Kubernetes API deprecations and removals] for information about how to check your cluster for Kubernetes APIs that are planned for removal.

[id="ocp-4-18-known-issues_{context}"]
== Known issues

* A regression in the behaviour of `libreswan` caused some nodes with IPsec enabled to lose communication with pods on other nodes in the same cluster. To resolve this issue, consider disabling IPsec for your cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-43713[*OCPBUGS-43713*])

[id="ocp-telco-ran-4-18-known-issues_{context}"]

* When you run Cloud-native Network Functions (CNF) latency tests on an {product-title} cluster, the test can sometimes return results greater than the latency threshold for the test; for example, 20 microseconds for `cyclictest` testing. This results in a test failure.

== Asynchronous errata updates

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for {product-title} {product-version} are released as asynchronous errata through the Red{nbsp}Hat Network. All {product-title} {product-version} errata is https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[available on the Red Hat Customer Portal]. See the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} Life Cycle] for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account settings for Red{nbsp}Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications are enabled, users are notified through email whenever new errata relevant to their registered systems are released.

[NOTE]
====
Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming {product-title} entitlements for {product-title} errata notification emails to generate.
====

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of {product-title} {product-version}. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form {product-title} {product-version}.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any {product-title} release, always review the instructions on xref:../updating/updating_a_cluster/updating-cluster-web-console.adoc#updating-cluster-web-console[updating your cluster] properly.
