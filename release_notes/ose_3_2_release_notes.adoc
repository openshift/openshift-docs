== Overview

OpenShift Enterprise by Red Hat is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that provides
developers and IT organizations with a cloud application platform for deploying
new applications on secure, scalable resources with minimal configuration and
management overhead. OpenShift Enterprise supports a wide selection of
programming languages and frameworks, such as Java, Ruby, and PHP.

Built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Google Kubernetes, OpenShift Enterprise
provides a secure and scalable multi-tenant operating system for todayâ€™s
enterprise-class applications, while providing integrated application runtimes
and libraries. OpenShift Enterprise brings the OpenShift PaaS platform to
customer data centers, enabling organizations to implement a private PaaS that
meets security, privacy, compliance, and governance requirements.

[[ose-32-new-features-and-enhancements]]
== New Features and Enhancements

OpenShift Enterprise version 3.2 is now available. Ensure that you follow the
instructions on upgrading your OpenShift cluster properly, including steps
specific to this release.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any release, always review the Installation and Configuration guide for
instructions on xref:../install_config/upgrading/index.adoc#install-config-upgrading-index[upgrading your
OpenShift cluster] properly, including any additional steps that may be required
for a specific release.

[[ose-32-new-features-and-enhancements-admins]]
=== For Administrators

[[ose-32-updated-infrastructure-components]]
==== Updated Infrastructure Components

- Kubernetes has been updated to v1.2.0-36.
- etcd has been updated to v2.2.5.
- OpenShift Enterprise 3.2 requires Docker 1.9.1.

[[ose-32-configuration-and-administration]]
==== Configuration and Administration

- xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/admission_controllers.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-admission-controllers[Admission
controllers] are now included, which intercept requests to the master API prior
to persistence of a resource, but after the request is authenticated and
authorized. The following admission control plug-ins can be configured:
** The number of projects an individual user can create can be limited via the
`*ProjectRequestLimit*` admission controller. See
xref:../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#limit-projects-per-user[Limiting
Number of Self-Provisioned Projects Per User] for details.
** A build defaults admission controller can be used to set default environment
variables on all builds created, including global proxy settings. See
xref:../install_config/build_defaults_overrides.adoc#install-config-build-defaults-overrides[Configuring Global Build
Defaults and Overrides] for details.
** The `*PodNodeConstraints*` admission control plug-in has been added, which
constrains the use of the `*NodeName*` field in a pod definition to roles which
have the `pods/binding` permission. This allows administrators, via
`*NodeSelectorLabelBlacklist*`, to specify node labels by setting them in the
`*NodeSelector*` field of the pod definition. See
xref:../admin_guide/scheduler.adoc#controlling-pod-placement[Controlling Pod
Placement] for details.
- Multiple web login providers can now be configured at the same time.
- The `oc adm diagnostics` command can now launch a diagnostic pod that reports on
more potential issues with pod networking, DNS configuration, and registry
authentication.
- Support for security context constraints (SCCs) has been added to the `oc
describe` command.
- The `*NO_PROXY*` environment variable will now accept a CIDR in a number of
places in the code for controlling which IP ranges bypass the default HTTP proxy
settings. See
xref:../install_config/http_proxies.adoc#configuring-hosts-for-proxies[Configuring
Hosts for Proxies] for details.
- Masters are now taken down one at a time during upgrades through rolling
restarts. The `*openshift_rolling_restart_mode*` parameter can now be used in
Ansible inventories to control this behavior: `services` for service restarts or
`system` for full system restarts. See
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-cluster-variables[Configuring
Cluster Variables] for details.

[[ose-32-security]]
==== Security

- The new `*Volumes*` field in SCCs allows an administrator full control over
which volume plug-ins may be specified.
** In order to maintain backwards compatibility, the `*AllowHostDirVolumePlugin*`
field takes precedence over the `*Volumes*` field for the host mounts. You may
use `*` to allow all volumes.
** By default, regular users are now forbidden from directly mounting any of the
remote volume type; they must use a persistent volume claim (PVC).
- The new `*ReadOnlyRootFilesystem*` field in SCCs allows an administrator to
force containers to run with a read-only root file system.
** If set to true, containers are required to run with a read-only root file system
by their `*SecurityContext*`. Containers that do not set this value to true will
be defaulted. Containers that explicitly set this value to false will be
rejected.
** If set to false, containers may use a read-only root file system, but they are
not forced to run with one.
- By default, the *restricted* and *anyuid* SCCs drop Linux capabilities that
could be used to escalate container privileges. Administrators can change the
list of default or enforced capabilities.
- A constant-time string comparison is now used on webhooks.
- Only users authenticated via OAuth can request projects.
- A GitLab server can now be used as an identity provider. See
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#GitLab[Configuring
Authentication] for details.
- The `SETUID` and `SETGID` capabilities have been added back to the *anyuid* SCC,
which ensures that programs that start as root and then drop to a lower
permission level will work by default.
- Quota support has been added for `*emptydir*`. When the quota is enabled on an
XFS system, nodes will limit the amount of space any given project can use on a
node to a fixed upper bound. The quota is tied to the `*FSGroup*` of the
project. Administrators can control this value by editing the project directly
or allowing users to set `*FSGroup*` via SCCs.
- The `*DaemonSet*` object is now limited to cluster administrators because pods
running under a `*DaemonSet*` are considered to have higher priority than
regular pods, and for regular users on the cluster this could be a security
issue.
- Administrators can prevent clients from accessing the API by their `User-Agent`
header the new `*userAgentMatching*` configuration setting.

[[ose-integrated-docker-registry]]
==== Integrated Docker Registry

- A readiness probe and health check have been added to the integrated registry to
ensure new instances do not serve traffic until they are fully initialized.

[[ose-32-routes]]
==== Routes

- You can limit the frequency of router reloads using the `--interval=DURATION`
flag or `*RELOAD_INTERVAL*` environment variable to the router. This can
minimize the memory and CPU used by the router while reloading, at the cost of
delaying when the route is exposed via the router.
- Routers now report back status to the master about whether routes are accepted,
rejected, or conflict with other users. The CLI will now display that error
information, allowing users to know that the route is not being served.
- Using _router sharding_, you can specify a selection criteria for either
namespaces (projects) or labels on routes. This enables you to select the routes
a router would expose, and you can use this functionality to distribute routes
across a set of routers, or shards.

[[ose-32-storage]]
==== Storage

- The `*NoDiskConflicts*` scheduling predicate can be added to the scheduler
configuration to ensure that pods using the same Ceph RBD device are not placed
on the same node. See xref:../admin_guide/scheduler.adoc#admin-guide-scheduler[Scheduler] for details.

[[ose-32-administrator-cli]]
==== Administrator CLI

- The administrative commands are now exposed via `oc adm` so you have access to
them in a client context. The `oadm` commands will still work, but will be a
symlink to the `openshift` binary.
- The help output of the `oadm policy` command has been improved.
- Service accounts are now supported for the router and registry:
** The router can now be created without specifying `--credentials` and it will use
the router service account in the current project.
** The registry will also use a service account if `--credentials` is not
provided. Otherwise, it will set the values from the `--credentials` file as
environment on the generated deployment configuration.
- Administrators can pass the `--all-namespaces` flag to `oc status` to see status
information across all namespaces and projects.

[[ose-32-admin-web-console]]
==== Web Console

- Users can now be presented with a customized, branded page before continuing on
to a login identity provider. This allows users to see your branding up front
instead of immediately redirecting to identity providers like GitHub and Google.
See
xref:../install_config/web_console_customization.adoc#customizing-the-login-page[Customizing
the Login Page] for details.
- CLI download URLs and documentation URLs are now customizable through web
console extensions. See
xref:../install_config/web_console_customization.adoc#adding-or-changing-links-to-download-the-cli[Adding
or Changing Links to Download the CLI] for details.

[[ose-32-new-features-and-enhancements-devs]]
=== For Developers

[[ose-32-dev-web-console]]
==== Web Console

- The web console uses a brand new theme that changes the look and feel of the
navigation, tabs, and other page elements. See
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#project-overviews[Project
Overviews] for details.
+
image::ose32-relnote-project-overview.png["Updated Web Console Theme"]
- A new *About* page provides developers with information about the product
version, `oc` CLI download locations, and a quick access to their current token
to login using `oc login`. See
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#web-console-cli-downloads[CLI
Downloads] for details.
+
image::ose32-relnote-about-page.png["New About Page"]
- You can now add or edit resource constraints for your containers during *Add to
Project* or later from the deployment configuration.
+
image::ose32-relnote-resource-limits.png["Set Resource Limits"]
- A form-based editor for build configurations has been added for modifying
commonly edited fields directly from the web console.
+
image::ose32-relnote-edit-bc.png["Edit Build Configurations"]
- All *Browse* resource pages (e.g, viewing a particular pod) now have a tab for
*Events* related to that pod.
- Limits, quotas, and quota scopes are now displayed.
- More error and warning information is now displayed about routes, their
configuration, and their use in the system.
- Support has been added for filtering and sorting on all *Events* pages.
- You can now edit a project's display name and description from the *Settings*
page.
- Existing persistent volume claims (PVCs) can now be listed and attached to
deployments and deployment configurations.
- More detailed pod status is now provided on all pages.
- Better status and alert messages are now provided.
- Improved *_Dockerfile_* build keyword highlighting has been added when editing
builds.
- More accurate information is now displayed about routes based on which addresses
the router exposed them under.
- The layout and display of logs have been improved.

[[ose-32-developer-cli]]
==== Developer CLI

- The following commands have been added to `oc create`, allowing more objects to
be created directly using the CLI (instead of passing it a file or JSON/YAML):
+
[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|====
|Command          |Description

|`namespace`
|Create a namespace with the specified name.

|`secret`
|Create a secret using a specific subcommand: `docker-registry` or `generic`.

|`configmap`
|Create a `*ConfigMap*` from a local file, directory, or literal value.

|`serviceaccount`
|Create a service account with the specified name.

|`route`
|Expose containers externally via secured routes. Use the `edge`, `passthrough`,
or `reencrypt` subcommands and specify the secret values to be used for the
route.
|====
- Display more information about the application being created by the `oc new-app`
command, including any display name or description set on the image as a label,
or whether the image may require running as root.
- If you have set up the *latest* tag in an image stream to point to another tag
in the same image stream, the `oc new-app` command will follow that reference
and create the application using the referenced tag, not *latest*. This allows
administrators to ensure applications are created on stable tags (like
*php:5.6*). The default image streams created in the *openshift* project follow
this pattern.
- You can view the logs of the oldest pod in a deployment or build configuration
with:
+
----
$ oc logs dc/<name>
----
- The `oc set env` and `oc volume` commands have been moved to `oc set env` and `oc
set volume`, and future commands that modify aspects of existing resources will
be located under this command.
- When a pod is crash-looping, meaning it is starting and exiting repeatedly, an
error is now displayed in `oc status` output and provides more information about
possible causes.
- The new `oc debug` command makes it easy to obtain shell access in a misbehaving
pod. It clones the exact environment of the running deployment configuration,
replication controller, or pod, but replaces the run command with a shell.
- The new `oc set trigger` command can be used to update deployment and build
configuration triggers.
- More information is displayed about liveness and readiness probes in the `oc
status` and `oc describe` commands.

[[ose-32-builds-and-image-sources]]
==== Builds and Image Sources

- Builds can now be supplied with input files from unrelated images. Previously,
all input to a build had to come from the builder image itself, or a Git
repository. It is now possible to specify additional images and paths within
those images to use as an input to a build for things like external
dependencies.
+
Use the `--source-image=<image>` and
`--source-image-path=<source>:<destination>` flags with the `oc new-build`
command to specify images.
+
The example shown below injects the *_/usr/lib/jenkins/jenkins.war_* file out of
the image currently tagged with *jenkins:latest* into the *_installed-apps_*
directory of the build input:
+
====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
  name: imagedockerbuild
spec:
  source:
    images:
    - from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: jenkins:latest
      paths:
      - destinationDir: installed-apps/
        sourcePath: /usr/lib/jenkins/jenkins.war
----
====
+
Ensure that you set an image change trigger for *jenkins:latest* if you want to
rebuild every time that image is updated.

- Builds can now be supplied with secrets for use during the build process.
Previously, secrets could be used for Git cloning but now secrets can also be
made available to the build process itself so that build operations such as
Maven packaging can use a secret for credentials. See
xref:../dev_guide/builds.adoc#using-secrets[Using Secrets During a Build] for
details.

- Builds now properly use Git submodules when checking out the source repository.
When a build configuration is deleted (via `oc delete`), all associated builds
are now deleted as well. To prevent this behavior, specify `--cascade=false`.

- Custom build configurations can now specify the API version to use. This API
version will determine the schema version used for the serialized build
configuration supplied to the custom build pod in the `*BUILD*` environment
variable.

- Resource limits are now enforced on the container launched by S2I builds, and
also on the operations performed within containers as part of a `docker build`
of a *_Dockerfile_*. Previously, the resource limit only applied to the build
pod itself and not the containers spawned by the build process.

- You can now provide a command to be triggered after a build succeeds but before
the push. You can set `shell` (to run a shell script), `command`, or `args` to
run a command in the working directory of the built image. All S2I builders set
the user's source repository as the working directory, so commands like `bundle
exec rake test` should work. See xref:../dev_guide/builds.adoc#build-hooks[Build
Hooks] for details.

[[ose-32-image-imports]]
==== Image Imports

- You can now import images from Docker v2 registries that are authenticated via Basic or Token credentials. To import, create a secret in your project based on a *_.docker/config.json_* or *_.dockercfg_* file:
+
----
$ oc secrets new hub .dockerconfigjson=$HOME/.docker/config.json
Created secret/hub

$ oc import-image auth-protected/image-from-dockerhub
The import completed successfully.

Name:       image-from-dockerhub
Created:    Less than a second ago

Tag     Spec                                 Created
latest  default/image-from-dockerhub:latest  Less than a second ago ...
----
+
When importing, all secrets in your project of those types will be checked. To
exclude a secret from being a candidate for importing, use the
`*openshift.io/image.excludeSecret*` annotation set to *true*:
+
----
$ oc annotate secret/hub openshift.io/image.excludeSecret=true
----

- Image stream tags can be set to be automatically imported from remote
repositories when they change (public or private). {product-title} will
periodically query the remote registry and check for updates depending on the
configuration the administrator sets. By default, images will be checked every
15 minutes.
+
To set an image to be imported automatically, use the `--scheduled` flag with
the `oc tag` command:
+
----
$ oc tag --source=docker redis:latest myredis:latest --scheduled
Tag myredis:latest set to import redis:latest periodically.
----
+
You can see which images are being scheduled using:
+
----
$ oc describe is myredis
----
+
Administrators can control whether scheduling is enabled, the polling interval,
and the rate at which images can be imported via the `*imagePolicyConfig*`
section in the *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file.

- The integrated Docker registry now supports _image pullthrough_, allowing you to
tag a remote image into {product-title} and directly pull it from the integrated
registry as if it were already pushed to the {product-title} registry. If the
remote registry is configured to use content-offload (sending back a temporary
redirect URL to the actual binary contents), that value will be passed through
the {product-title} registry and down to the Docker daemon, avoiding the need to
proxy the binary contents.
+
To try pullthrough, tag an image from the DockerHub:
+
----
$ oc tag --source=docker redis:latest redis:local
$ oc get is redis
NAME      DOCKER REPO                     TAGS     UPDATED
mysql     172.30.1.5:5000/default/redis   local    Less than a second ago
----
+
Log into your local Docker registry, then pull the image from the integrated
registry:
+
----
$ docker pull 127.30.1.5:5000/default/redis:local
Using default tag: local
Trying to pull repository 127.30.1.5:5000/default/redis ... latest: Pulling from 127.30.1.5:5000/default/redis
47d44cb6f252: Pull complete
838c1c5c4f83: Pull complete
5764f0a31317: Pull complete
60e65a8e4030: Pull complete
449f8db3c25a: Pull complete
a6b6487c42f6: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:c541c66a86b0715bfbb89c5515929268196b642551beccf8fbd452bb00170cde
Status: Downloaded newer image for 127.30.1.5:5000/default/redis:local
----
+
You can use pullthrough with private images; the integrated registry will use
the same secret you imported the image with to fetch content from the remote
registry.

- The `oc describe` command now reports overall image size for imported images as
well as the individual layers and size of each layer.

- When importing an entire remote repository, only the first five tags are
imported by default. {product-title} preferentially imports the *latest* tag and
the highest semantically versioned tag (i.e., tags in the form *v5*, *5.0*, or
*5.0.1*). You can import the remaining tags directly. Lists of tags will be
sorted with the latest tag on top, followed by the highest major semantic tags,
in descending order.

[[ose-32-test-deployments]]
==== Test Deployments

It is now possible to create a "test" deployment that will scale itself down to
zero when a deployment is complete. This deployment can be used to verify that
an image will be correctly rolled out without requiring the pods to be running
all the time. To create a test deployment, use the `--as-test` flag on `oc
new-app` or set the `*spec.test*` field of a deployment configuration to `true`
via `oc edit`.

The deployment triggers like any other deployment configuration, scaling up to
the current `*spec.replicas*` value when triggered. After the deployment has
completed with a success or failure, it is then scaled down to zero. You can use
deployment hooks to test or verify the deployment; because hooks run as part of
the deployment process, a test suite running in your hook can ensure your
application is correct and pass or fail the deployment.

You can add a local database or other test container to the deployment pod
template, and have your application code verify itself before passing to the
next step.

Scaling a test deployment will only affect the next deployment.

[[ose-32-recreate-strategy]]
==== Recreate Strategy

- The Recreate deployment strategy now supports `mid` hooks, which run while all
old pods have been scaled down and before any new pods are scaled up; use it to
run migrations or configuration changes that can only happen while the
application is completely shut down.

- The Recreate deployment strategy now has the same behavior as the Rolling
strategy, requiring the pod to be "Ready" before continuing with the deployment.
A new field `*timeoutSeconds*` was added to the strategy that is the maximum
allowed interval between pods becoming ready; it defaults to `120s`.

[[ose-32-other-enhancements]]
==== Other Enhancements

- The new Kubernetes 1.2 xref:../dev_guide/configmaps.adoc#dev-guide-configmaps[ConfigMap] resource is
now usable.
- Pods being pulled or terminating are now distinguished in the pod status output,
and the size of images is now shown with other pod information.
- The Jenkins image can now be used as an S2I-compatible build image. See
xref:../using_images/other_images/jenkins.adoc#jenkins-as-s2i-builder[Using
Jenkins as a Source-to-Image Builder] for details.

[[ose-32-notable-technical-changes]]
== Notable Technical Changes

OpenShift Enterprise 3.2 introduces the following notable technical changes:

[[ose-32-notable-technical-changes-admins]]
=== For Administrators

==== Services with External IPs Rejected by Default

By default, services with external IPs are now rejected because, in some cases,
they can be used to allow services to pretend to act as nodes. The new
`*networkConfig.externalIPNetworkCIDR*` parameter has been added to the
*_master-config.yaml_* file to control the allowable values for external IPs. By
default, it is empty, which rejects all values. Cluster administrators can set
it to `0.0.0.0/0` to emulate the behavior from OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.

==== Build Strategy Permissions Separated into Distinct Roles

Build strategy permissions have been separated into distinct roles.
Administrators who have denied access to Docker, Source, or Custom builds must
now assign users or groups to those roles by default. See
xref:../admin_guide/securing_builds.adoc#admin-guide-securing-builds[Securing Builds by Strategy] for
details.

==== FSGroup Enabled by Default for restricted and hostaccess SCCs

`*FSGroup*` is now enabled by default in the *restricted* and *hostaccess* SCCs.
This means that pods matched against those SCCs will now:

- Have the `*pod.spec.securityContext.fsGroup*` field populated to a
namespace-wide allocated value automatically.
- Have their *emptyDir*-derived (*emptyDir*, *gitRepo*, *secret*, *configMap*, and
*downwardAPI*) and block device volumes (basically every network volume except
*ceph* and *nfs*) owned by the `*FSGroup*`.
- Run with the `*FSGroup*` in each container's list of supplemental groups.

==== Tightened Directory Permissions on Hosts

Permissions on the *_/etc/origin_* directory have been tightened to prevent
unprivileged users from reading the contents of this directory tree.
Administrators should ensure that, if necessary, they have provided other means
to access the generated CA certificate.

[[ose-32-dns-changes]]
==== DNS Changes

- By default, new nodes installed with {product-title} 3.2 will have Dnsmasq
installed and configured as the default nameserver for both the host and pods.

- By default, new masters installed with {product-title} 3.2 will run SkyDNS on
port 8053 rather than 53. Network access controls must allow nodes to connect to
masters on port 8053. This is necessary so that Dnsmasq may be configured on all
nodes.

[NOTE]
====
The above DNS changes only apply to new installations of {product-title} 3.2.
Clusters upgraded from {product-title} 3.1 to 3.2 do not currently have these
changes applied during the upgrade process.
====

==== New Default Values for Pod Networking

The default values for pod networking have changed:

[options="header"]
|====
|*_master-config.yaml_* Field |Ansible Variable |Old Value |New Value

|`*clusterNetworkCIDR*`
|`*osm_cluster_network_cidr*`
|10.1.0.0/16
|10.128.0.0/14 (i.e., 10.128.0.0 - 10.131.255.255)

|`*hostSubnetLength*`
|`*osm_host_subnet_length*`
|8 (i.e., /24 subnet)
|9 (i.e., /23 subnet)
|====

==== API Changes

- Due to a change in the upstream JSON serialization path used in Kubernetes, some
fields that were previously accepted case-insensitively are no longer accepted.
Validate that your API objects have the correct case for all attributes.
- When creating a deployment configuration, omitting the `*spec.selector*` field
will default that value to the pod template labels.
- `*ImageStreamTag*` objects now return the spec tag `tag`, the current status
conditions, and latest status generation `generation`, so clients can get an
accurate view of the current tag.
- `*ImageStreamTag*` objects can be updated via `PUT` to set their spec tag in a
single call.
- Deployment configuration hooks now default the container name if there is only a
single container in the deployment configuration.

==== Increased Default MaxPodsPerNode

The default value for `*MaxPodsPerNode*` has been increased to `110` to reflect
updated capacity.

[[ose-32-ha-masters-support]]
==== High Availability Masters Support

Administrators are recommended to take advantage of the native HA method for
multiple masters built in to OpenShift instead of previous solutions such as
Pacemaker. Starting with OpenShift Enterprise 3.2, the Pacemaker HA method is no
longer supported by the installer and upgrade playbooks, and administrators
should upgrade to the native HA method before upgrading the cluster to 3.2. See
the
https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/install_config/upgrading/pacemaker_to_native_ha.html[Upgrading
from Pacemaker to Native HA] in the OpenShift Enterprise 3.1 documentation for
instructions.

[[ose-32-notable-technical-changes-devs]]
=== For Developers

[[ose-32-changes-dev-cli]]
==== Developer CLI

The `oc rsh` command now launches `/bin/sh`, not `/bin/bash`. To have the old
behavior, run:

----
$ oc rsh <name> -- /bin/bash
----

[[ose-32-bug-fixes]]
== Bug Fixes

The following bugs have been fixed:

- Passthrough routes may not be specified with paths. Because passthrough does not
decode the route, there is no way for the router to check the path without
decoding the request. The `oc status` command will now warn you if you have any
such routes.
- The `oc new-app` command now returns more information about errors encountered
while searching for matches to user input.
- When using images from registries that are not the DockerHub, do not insert the `library` prefix.
- The image ID returned from the `*ImageStreamImage*` API was not the correct value.
- The router health check was not correct on all systems when using host
networking. It now defaults to using *localhost*.
- OAuth client secrets are now correctly reset in HA master configurations.
- Improved the web console's performance when displaying many deployments or builds.
- The router unique host check should not reprocess routes that did not change.
- Added the `*AlwaysPull*` admission controller to prevent users from being able
to run images that others have already pulled to the node.
- Fixed `oc edit` when editing multiple items in a list form.
- The recycler for persistent volumes now uses a service account and has proper
access to restricted content.
- The block profiler in `pprof` is now supported.
- Additional `cGroup` locations are now handled when constraining builds.
- Scratch images from `oc new-app` are now handled.
- Added support for paged LDAP queries.
- Fixed a performance regression in `cAdvisor` that resulted in long pauses on
Kubelet startup.
- The `oc edit` command was not properly displaying all errors when saving an
edited resource failed.
- More information is now shown about persistent volume claims and persistent
volumes in a number of places in the CLI and web console.
- Some commands that used the API PATCH command could fail intermittently when
they were executed on the server and another user edited at the same time.
- Users are now warned when trying to import a non-existent tag with the `oc
import-image` command.
- Singular pods are now shown in `oc status` output.
- Router fixes:
** More information is now shown from the router reload command in the router logs.
** Routes that changed at the same time could compete for being exposed if they
were in different namespaces. The check for which route gets exposed has been
made predictable.
** The health check is now used when restarting the router to ensure the new
process is correctly running before continuing.
- Better errors are displayed in the web console when JavaScript is disabled.
- Failed deployments now update the status of the deployment configuration more
rapidly, reducing the time before the old deployment is scaled back up.
- Persistent volume claims (PVCs) are no longer blocked by the default SCC policy
for users.
- Continue to support host ports on the `oadm router` command. Administrators can
disable them with `--host-ports=false` when `--host-network=false` is also set.
- Events are now emitted when the cancellation of a deployment fails.
- When invoking a binary build, retry if the input image stream tag does not exist
yet (because it may be in the process of being imported).
- Fixed a race condition in Kubernetes where endpoints might be partially updated
(only have some pods) when the controller is restarted.
- Docker containers do not allow CPU quota less than `10m`, so set the minimum
value.
- Do not sync `*DaemonSet*` objects that match all pods.
- The `oc new-build` command no longer fails when creating a binary build on a Git
repository that does not have an upstream remote set.
- Fixed a race condition between scaled up routers where some changes might be
ignored.
- Enable the etcd watch cache for Kubernetes resources, reducing memory use and
duplicate watches.
- Change the `*RunOnce*` pod duration restrictor to act as a limit instead of
override.
- Guarantee partially completed builds are cleaned up when cancelled.
- Check `*claimRef*` UID when processing a recycled persistent volume (PV) to
prevent races.
- The `*ProjectRequestLimit*` plug-in now ignores projects in terminating state.
- The `*ConfigMap*` volume is now readable as non-root.
- The *system:image-auditor* role has been added for managing the image registry.
- Dynamic volume provisioning can now be disabled.
- Deployment pods should now be cancelled when deployments are cancelled in all
cases.
- The deployer controller should now ensure deployments that are cancelled cannot
become completed.
- Concurrent deployer pod creation is now prevented.
- Fixed an issue where a pod would never terminate if the registry it pulls images
from was unavailable.
- Fixed precision of CPU to millicore and memory to Mi in the UI.
- The HAProxy router should now obfuscate the pod IP in when using cookies for
session affinity.

[[ose-32-relnotes-rhba-2016-1208]]
=== RHBA-2016:1208 - atomic-openshift-utils Bug Fix Update

Issued: 2016-06-07

OpenShift Enterprise bug fix advisory
https://access.redhat.com/errata/product/290/ver=3.2/rhel---7/x86_64/RHBA-2016:1208[RHBA-2016:1208],
providing updated *atomic-openshift-utils* and *openshift-ansible* packages that
fix several bugs, is now available.

[NOTE]
====
The instructions for applying this update are provided in the
https://access.redhat.com/errata/product/290/ver=3.2/rhel---7/x86_64/RHBA-2016:1208[Solution]
section of the advisory.
====

Space precluded documenting all of the bug fixes in the advisory. This release
includes the following bug fixes:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1331346[BZ#1331346]::
The installer's global proxy configuration support did not correctly configure
the `*BuildDefaults*` admission controller. The installer has been updated to
properly configure the `*BuildDefaults*` admission controller.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1337438[BZ#1337438]::
The installer was incorrectly adding extra single quotes to the
*_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* file on each run due to an errant newline in the
Ansible role. This bug fix updates the installer to remove the newline, and as a
result the extra quotes no longer appear.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1334187[BZ#1334187]::
Due to *docker-1.9.1-40* packaging changes, it is no longer possible to use `yum
downgrade` to downgrade from *docker-1.9.1* to *docker-1.8.2* as required for
OpenShift Enterprise 3.1 and 3.0 installations. The installer has been updated
to use `yum swap` to perform this downgrade when necessary.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1336780[BZ#1336780]::
Due to packaging changes in *docker-1.9.1-40*, containerized nodes did not have
the correct Docker components mounted from the host into the node container.
This prevented pods from being correctly configured to use the SDN. The missing
components have been added to the containerized node configuration.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1330934[BZ#1330934]::
The installer did not properly convert the `*openshift_generate_no_proxy_hosts*`
Ansible variable to a boolean so it may have been ignored. This bug fix updates
the installer and the `*openshift_generate_no_proxy_hosts*` variable is now
properly converted into a boolean ensuring that this variable produces the
desired effect.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1330935[BZ#1330935]::
Containerized installations of OpenShift Enterprise (OSE) 3.1 were incorrectly
receiving configuration defaults intended only to be used with OSE 3.2
installations. This meant that *dnsmasq* was configured for OSE 3.1 installs
when it should not have been. This bug fix updates the fixed containerized
version detection so that the correct default configurations are applied to OSE
3.1 installations. This means *dnsmasq* will no longer be included by default on
OSE 3.1 containerized installations. This bug only affected containerized
installations.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1331097[BZ#1331097]::
Previously under certain configurations, running the *_config.yml_* playbook
could fully upgrade a containerized OpenShift Enterprise environment to the
latest available image versions in configured registries. This bug fix updates
the *_config.yml_* playbook to ensure images are not updated in these scenarios,
and as a result the playbook can be run safely without inadvertently upgrading
images to a newer version.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1331365[BZ#1331365]::
The quick installer has been updated to help make proxy-related questions more
clear as to what information is being requested.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1331239[BZ#1331239]::
The quick installer incorrectly prompted for global proxy configuration settings
when installing OpenShift Enterprise (OSE) 3.1. The installer has been updated
to no longer prompt for global proxy settings in OSE 3.0 and 3.1 installations
because this feature requires OSE 3.2.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1331236[BZ#1331236]::
Proxy variables previously were not written correctly to Ansible inventories by
the quick installer. This bug fix updates the quick installer to ensure the
`*openshift_http_proxy*`, `*openshift_https_proxy*`, `*openshift_no_proxy*`
variables are written to inventories.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1334895[BZ#1334895]::
The NetworkManager dispatcher script which configures *dnsmasq* in OpenShift
Enterprise 3.2 did not account for static network configurations. The dispatcher
script has been updated to work for static network configurations.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1330920[BZ#1330920]::
The example Ansible inventories used the incorrect syntax for the
`*openshift_generate_no_proxy_hosts*` variable. If administrators had copied and
pasted the example syntax, it would not have taken effect. This bug fix updates
the example inventories with the correct syntax for setting this variable.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1335063[BZ#1335063]::
The installer's global proxy configuration incorrectly quoted values in the
master's *_sysconfig_* files. This meant that containerized installs using proxy
configurations created by the installer would have failed. The installer has
been updated to use proper quoting syntax.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1337425[BZ#1337425]::
The installer uses the `repoquery` command, which is provided by the *yum-utils*
package and is not in Minimal installations of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x.
Ansible 1.9 installed this package before calling the command, but it is no
longer installed starting with Ansible 2.0. This bug fix updates the installer
to check that the *yum-utils* package is installed, and attempts to install it
if it is not.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1334639[BZ#1334639]::
When configuring Ansible variables in inventories using raw booleans,
installations could fail due to broken master configurations. This bug fix
updates the installer to ensure that these values are properly converted to the
master configuration files.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1334148[BZ#1334148]::
The default for the `*openshift_docker_hosted_registry_insecure*` Ansible
variable is `true` but if it was set explicitly to `true` in an inventory, the
installation would product an error. Setting the variable to `false` caused it
to be ignored. This bug fix updates the installer to respect explicitly setting
this value.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1329496[BZ#1329496]::
Previously, the `*osm_default_subdomain*` Ansible variable did not take effect when
set. This was due to a backwards compatibility issue in the installer. This bug
fix updates the installer to once again respect setting this variable.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1326045[BZ#1326045]::
The legacy `*cli_docker_options*` and `*cli_docker_log_options*` Ansible
variables were not working due to use of an outdated host group that was since
refactored. The variables were supposed to be migrated to the new format, using
the `*openshift_docker_options*` and `*openshift_docker_log_options*` variables,
respectively. This bug fix updates the installer so that the legacy variables
can be used again.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1326642[BZ#1326642]::
During an upgrade, if the `*openshift_image_tag*` Ansible variable was set in an
inventory to an image version that was older than the latest available, the
latest available version was still set in the *systemd* unit files. This bug fix
updates the installer to ensure the version set by `*openshift_image_tag*` is
what actually gets set in the *systemd* unit files.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1336202[BZ#1336202]::
Upgrades from OpenShift Enterprise (OSE) 3.1 to 3.2 on RPM-based installations
incorrectly attempted to pull the *openshift3/ose:latest* image. This step is
only required for containerized installations and has been removed from
RPM-based installations, eliminating the need to pull an unexpected image.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1331389[BZ#1331389]::
Previously, the `*cli_docker_additional_registries*` Ansible variable did not
take effect during an upgrade. This was due to legacy options (`*cli_**`) not
being migrated during upgrades. This bug fix updates the installer to migrate
these options correctly.

[[ose-3-2-1-1]]
=== RHBA-2016:1343 - OpenShift Enterprise 3.2.1.1 bug fix and enhancement update

Issued: 2016-06-27

{product-title} release 3.2.1.1
(https://access.redhat.com/errata/product/290/ver=3.1/rhel---7/x86_64/RHBA-2016:1343[RHBA-2016:1343])
is now available.

See the following sections for notes on upgrading and details on the
enhancements, bug fixes, and known issues included in this release.

[[ose-3-2-1-1-upgrading]]
==== Upgrading

Currently, you must use the
xref:../install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.adoc#install-config-upgrading-manual-upgrades[manual cluster upgrade
steps] to apply this asynchronous errata update from {product-title} 3.2.0 to
3.2.1.1. An automated playbook for this minor upgrade path is in development,
and the upgrade documentation will be updated with instructions when it is
available.

However, if you are upgrading from {product-title} 3.1, you can use the
*_v3_1_to_v3_2_* upgrade playbook as described in the
xref:../install_config/upgrading/automated_upgrades.adoc#upgrading-to-openshift-enterprise-3-2[Upgrading
to OpenShift Enterprise 3.2] automated cluster upgrade steps to upgrade all the
way to the latest asynchronous release at once.

[[ose-3-2-1-1-enhancements]]
==== Enhancements

Docker 1.10 Now Supported::
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 Server and RHEL Atomic 7.2.5 ship Docker 1.10.
{product-title} 3.2 supported Docker 1.9.1 at its general availability release,
and starting with {product-title} 3.2.1 now supports Docker 1.10 as well.
{product-title} 3.2.1 also still supports Docker 1.9.1. If any images exist on a
host when Docker is started after upgrading to 1.10, a lengthy upgrade process
is triggered automatically for the remaining images. As such, Red Hat recommends
removing all images before upgrading to Docker 1.10; this step is detailed in
the upgrade documentation.

[[ose-3-2-1-1-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1324179[*BZ#1324179*]::
Creation of the `builder` and `deployer` service accounts could be delayed for
newly-created projects, during which time users could not build or deploy
applications. This was caused by an issue when project templates defined a quota
for secrets. This bug fix ensures that service accounts and their tokens are
created quickly in this scenario (within seconds), and as a result users do not
have to wait after project creation to build or deploy applications.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1327500[*BZ#1327500*]::
Pod and build names allow for up to 256 characters, however label values cannot
be more than 64 characters. This caused builds to fail for build configurations
with names longer than 64 characters, due to the invalid length set for the
build pod's label. This bug fix truncates the value of build pod labels to 64
chars and relies on the build annotation to get the full name. As a result,
builds no longer fail in this scenario.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1334249[*BZ#1334249*]::
When attempting to run a PostgreSQL slave pod from the upstream replica
template, the pod could get stuck in CrashLoopBackOff status, citing a
"MEMORY_LIMIT_IN_BYTES: unbound variable" error. This bug fix ensures that
cgroup limits are properly handled for such pods, and as a result this issue no
longer occurs.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1333122[*BZ#1333122*]::
Events related to quota failures for compute resources produced multiple
identical events. This was due to errors describing why a request was rejected
having a variable ordering of responses for the same root cause. This bug fix
sorts resources in quota errors, and as a result duplicate events are avoided.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1334501[*BZ#1334501*]::
Previously when etcd watch cache was enabled, the API server would deliver a 410
HTTP response when a watch was attempted with a resourceVersion that was too
old. The expected result was a 200 HTTP status, with a single watch event of
type ERROR. This bug fix updates the API server to produce the same results in
this case, regardless of whether watch cache is enabled. The "410 Gone" error is
now returned as a watch error event, rather than as a HTTP 410 response.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1333172[*BZ#1333172*]::
Previously in the web console, it was difficult to tell the difference between
links to route host names linking to actual running applications versus
navigation links within the console. This was particularly difficult on the
Browse page for a route. This bug fix updates the web console so that route host
names are displayed with its entire web URL (protocol included), making it more
obvious that it is a link to the host name.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1333898[*BZ#1333898*]::
If a project had a large number of builds, and then many were deleted, the graph
in the web console showing the builds could become truncated and display poorly.
This bug fix updates the web console to avoid this issue.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1334485[*BZ#1334485*]::
When a project had no services but had a deployment configuration with no
deployments, the empty Overview page in the web console displayed a "No services
to show" message. This bug fix updates the message to more specifically read
"There are no services and no running deployments or pods."

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1333003[*BZ#1333003*]::
Previously, information on downloading and logging in to the CLI tool was shown
on the *About* page in the web console, linked from the *?* drop-down menu in
the top navigation. This bug fix updates the web console to include a separate
*Command Line Tools* page in this drop-down menu so that it is more obvious at a
glance. A link has also been added to the new page from the *About* page.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1333118[*BZ#1333118*]::
When adding environment variable or label name-value pairs in the web console
via *Add to Project*, it was previously unclear whether it required clicking the
*Add* button to actually the commit the changes before hitting *Create* at the
bottom of the page. This bug fix updates the web console to disable the *Create*
button while uncommitted name-value pairs are entered. A "Please add or clear
this name-value pair" message is also displayed until the pair has been added or
cleared.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1331816[*BZ#1331816*]::
The web console has been updated to more accurately reflect memory limit values.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1333158[*BZ#1333158*]::
When scaling deployments in the web console, if multiple scaling requests were
made in a short amount of time, it was possible for the operation to result with
an incorrect number of replicas. This bug fix addresses a timing issue, and as a
result the correct number of replicas are now set in this scenario.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1333590[*BZ#1333590*]::
Previously, template descriptions in the web console were collapsed into a
single line and truncated with no way to expand. Because the description could
contain important information or warnings, this bug fix updates the web console
to now display the full text, split into multiple lines if needed.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1333163[*BZ#1333163*]::
When editing a YAML object in the web console, pressing CTRL+F or CMD+F to
attempt to search the text did not appear to do anything. This bug fix updates
the web console so that doing so causes a search box to appear in the UI, as
expected.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1336526[*BZ#1336526*]::
The Documentation link in the *?* drop-down menu was hard-coded instead of using
the method described in
xref:../install_config/web_console_customization.adoc#changing-links-to-documentation[Customizing
the Web Console]. This bug fix updates the web console, and now this link can be
customized as expected.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1322271[*BZ#1322271*]::
In previous releases, network metrics were not included when cluster metrics
were enabled. This bug fix allows for network metrics to now be shown via REST
API.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1340324[*BZ#1340324*]::
Due to newer releases of docker changing the path of the docker executable,
containerized nodes could fail to initialize the SDN because they cannot execute
docker properly. This bug fix updates the containerized node image to
accommodate this change, and as a result containerized nodes work properly with
current and future versions of docker.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1334866[*BZ#1334866*]::
Previously, it was possible to set the `*metadata.deletionTimestamp*` parameter
during the update of an object. However, `*deletionTimestamp*` and
`*deletionGracePeriodSeconds*` fields should only be able to be set as a result
of a delete API operation. This bug fix ensures that the parameter cannot be set
during update, and any attempts now produce a "field is immutable; may only be
changed via deletion" error.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1333932[*BZ#1333932*]::
The etcd watch cache was enabled in a previous release for Kubernetes resource
types. This bug fix enables the etcd watch cache for all OpenShift resource
types, as well.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1326523[*BZ#1326523*]::
This bug fix adds the `*MYSQL_MAX_ALLOWED_PACKET*` environment variable to the
MySQL image, for setting the maximum size of one packet or any generated or
intermediate string (default: 200M).

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1320233[*BZ#1320233*]::
When the default HAProxy router reloaded its configuration during a resync
(default interval: 10 minutes), it was possible to experience dropped
connections to routes. This bug fix updates the *openshift3/ose-haproxy-router*
image to suppress reloads during sync events, and as a result the HAProxy router
no longer reloads periodically and connections to routes are no longer
interrupted for this reason.

[[ose-3-2-1-1-known-issues]]
==== Known Issues

- *Registry pushes using AWS S3 storage considerably slower with Docker 1.10*:
+
When pushing a local image to clusters using the registry with Amazon Simple
Storage Service (S3) storage back end from the Amazon Web Services platform, the
push takes considerably more time when using Docker 1.10 than Docker 1.9 when
the Docker registry is version 2.2.x or earlier. {product-title} 3.2 currently
ships Docker registry 2.2.1. If you are using S3 storage with your registry, it
is recommended that you do not upgrade to Docker 1.10 and {product-title} 3.2.1
at this time, until a subsequent {product-title} update is released that
addresses the issue.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1347022[*BZ#1347022*])

- *Images from Docker Hub fail due to v2 image schema:*
+
link:https://hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub] recently switched to only supporting v2
image schema, and Docker 1.10 defaults to converting to and using v2 schema when
pushing and pulling images. {product-title} 3.2 currently ships Docker registry
2.2.1, which does not support the v2 schema (none of the images provided in the
Red Hat Registry at
link:https://registry.access.redhat.com[registry.access.redhat.com] are
currently v2 schema). If any image with v2 schema is introduced to the cluster,
for example during an interaction with images from Docker Hub, Docker operations
will fail. The issue exists for Docker 1.9 as well specifically as it relates to
Docker Hub interactions. If you expect Docker Hub images to be used in your
environment, it is recommended that you do not upgrade to Docker 1.10 at this
time, until a subsequent {product-title} update is released that addresses the
issue.

Issued: 2016-08-18

OpenShift Enterprise bug fix advisory
https://access.redhat.com/errata/product/290/ver=3.2/rhel---7/x86_64/RHBA-2016:1639[RHBA-2016:1639],
providing updated *atomic-openshift-utils* and *openshift-ansible* packages that
fix several bugs and add enhancements, is now available.

Space precluded documenting all of the bug fixes and enhancement in the
advisory. See the following sections for notes on upgrading and details on the
enhancements and bug fixes included in this release.

[[rhba-2016-1639-upgrading]]
==== Upgrading

To apply this update, run the following on all hosts where you intend to
initiate Ansible-based installation or upgrade procedures:

----
# yum update atomic-openshift-utils
----

To update the default image streams to include the .NET Core S2I image, see
xref:../install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.adoc#updating-the-default-image-streams-and-templates[Updating
the Default Image Streams and Templates].

[[rhba-2016-1639-enhancements]]
==== Enhancements

Image Streams for .NET Core S2I Image::
Image stream definitions for the .NET Core on RHEL S2I image are now added
during OpenShift Enterprise 3.2 installations. (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1365285[*BZ#1365285*])

Ansible 2.x Now Required::
The OpenShift Enterprise 3.2 playbooks now require Ansible 2.x. (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1359236[*BZ#1359236*])

Named CA Certificates::
Administrators can now add the CA for named certificates to the generated CA
using the `cafile` option with the `*openshift_master_named_certificates*`
Ansible variable. For example:
+
----
openshift_master_named_certificates=[{"certfile": "/path/to/custom1.crt", "keyfile": "/path/to/custom1.key","cafile": "/path/to/ca.crt"}]
----
+
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1360754[*BZ#1360754*])

Backup and Redeploy Cluster Certificates::
Administrators can now backup and redeploy cluster certificates using the
following Ansible playbook:
+
----
$ ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/redeploy-certificates.yml
----
+
By default, the playbook retains the current OpenShift Enterprise CA. To replace
the CA with a generated or custom CA:
+
----
$ ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/redeploy-certificates.yml \
    --extra-vars "openshift_certificates_redeploy_ca=true"
----
+
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1275648[*BZ#1275648*])

[[rhba-2016-1639-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1365379[*BZ#1365379*]::
The installer now enables the `*NoVolumeZoneConflict*` scheduler policy by
default. This policy restricts that with pods with persistent volumes (PVs) be
scheduled in the availability zone where its PV is located.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1329455[*BZ#1329455*]::
Previously, the quick installer had issues adding new nodes to existing clusters
in certain configurations. This bug fix updates the installer to properly
identify these configurations and allow new nodes to be added as expected.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1356463[*BZ#1356463*]::
If Docker 1.8.2 is installed on a host before starting an OpenShift Enterprise
3.2 installation, Ansible now reports the following message: "Cannot upgrade
Docker to greater than or equal to 1.10, upgrade or remove Docker
manually, or use the Docker upgrade playbook if OpenShift is already installed."

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1316378[*BZ#1316378*]::
Previously when attempting to perform an initial installation on all new hosts,
the quick installer incorrectly detected an "Installed environment" if a
stand-alone load balancer host was included. This bug fix updates the installer
to properly identify these configurations and allow the installation to continue
as expected.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1357801[*BZ#1357801*]::
Previously, the installer failed when defining customized router certificate
files using the `*openshift_hosted_router_certificate*` Ansible variable. This
bug fix ensures that the certificate contents are properly checked when using
this variable, and as a result this issue no longer occurs.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1358101[*BZ#1358101*]::
The installation options for OpenShift Enterprise 3.1, OpenShift Enterprise 3.0,
and Atomic Enterprise Platform have been removed from the OpenShift Enterprise
3.2 version of the quick installer. To install OpenShift Enterprise 3.1 or 3.0,
use the *atomic-openshift-utils* package from the respective product version's
repository.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1358723[*BZ#1358723*]::
Previously, the installer failed when using the
`*openshift_hosted_router_replicas*` Ansible variable. This bug fix ensures that
the number of router replicas can be set using this variable, and as a result
this issue no longer occurs.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1357751[*BZ#1357751*]::
A section of the upgrade process was incorrectly running on RHEL Atomic Host
systems during upgrades, which would fail due to a missing `repoquery` command.
This bug fix modifies the upgrade process to skip this section that attempts to
upgrade Docker, as this is not possible on RHEL Atomic Host. As a result,
upgrades now complete successfully on RHEL Atomic Host systems.

==== Bug Fixes

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1412830[*BZ#1412830*]::
The extended certificate validation code (now enabled by default) would not allow some certificates that should be considered valid. This caused self-signed, expired, or not yet current certificates that were otherwise well-formed to be rejected. This bug fix changes the extended validation to allow those cases. As a result, those types of certificates are now allowed.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1404106[*BZ#1404106*]::
The *atomic-openshift-excluder* and *atomic-openshift-docker-excluder* packages did not properly configure yum to exclude the relevant packages. The excluder scripts have been updated to ensure the proper yum configuration is modified ensuring that the appropriate packages are excluded from yum operations.

[[ose-3-2-rhsa-2017-0448-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

This release fixes bugs for the following components:

*Installer*

* A change in Ansible 2.2.1.0 caused problems with the {product-title} 3.2 plabooks. This bug fix works around the change. ensuring that playbooks run correctly on Ansible 2.2.1.0 and newer. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1419533[*BZ#1419533*])

* An Ansible 2.2.1.0 compatibility issue has been fixed in the quick installer. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1421059[*BZ#1421059*])

* When executing the installer on a remote host that is also included in the inventory, the firewall configuration could potentially cause the installer to hang. A 10 second delay has been added after reseting the firewall to avoid this problem from occurring. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1379189[*BZ#1379189*])

* Network Manager previously reset the `net.ipv4.ip_forward` parameter, causing {product-title} to lose certain functionality. This bug fix ensures the installer sets the `sysctl` parameter on the system level, and as a result Network Manager restarts no longer interfere with the installation process. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1415067[*BZ#1415067*])

* A xref:../install_config/redeploying_certificates.adoc#install-config-cert-expiry[certificate expiry checker] has been added to the installer tools. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1417680[*BZ#1417680*])

==== Bug Fixes

* Previously, installation would fail in multi-master environments in which the load balanced API was listening on a different port than that of the {product-title} API and web console. This bug fix accounts for this difference and ensures the master loopback client configuration is configured to interact with the local master. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1462283[*BZ#1462283*])

* During certificate expiration checking or redeployment, certificiates with large serial numbers could not be parsed using the existing manual parser workaround on hosts that were missing the OpenSSL python library. This bug fix updates the manual parser to account for the format of certificates with large serial numbers. As a result, these certificates can now be parsed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1464546[*BZ#1464546*])

* The OpenShift CA redeployment playbook (*_playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/redeploy-openshift-ca.yml_*) would fail to restart services if certificates were previously expired. This bug fix ensures that service restarts are now skipped within the OpenShift CA redeployment playbook when expired certificates are detected. Expired cluster certificates may be replaced with the certificate redeployment playbook (*_playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/redeploy-certificates.yml_*) after the OpenShift CA certificate has been replaced via the OpenShift CA redeployment playbook. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1460972[*BZ#1460972*])

* If etcd 3.x or later was running on the host, a v3 snapshot database must be backed up as part of the backup process. If this directory is not included in the backup, then etcd failed to restore the backup even though v3 data was not used. This bug fix amends the etcd backup steps to ensure that the v3 snapshot database is included in backups. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1440303[*BZ#1440303*])

[[ose-3-2-rhba-2017-1666-enhancements]]
==== Enhancements

* Previously, it was only possible to redeploy the etcd CA certificate by also redeploying the OpenShift CA certificate, which was unnecessary maintenance. With this enhancement, the etcd CA certificate may now be replaced independent of the OpenShift CA certificate using the etcd CA certificate redeployment playbook (*_playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/redeploy-etcd-ca.yml_*). Note that the OpenShift CA redeployment playbook (*_playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/redeploy-openshift-ca.yml_*) now only replaces the OpenShift CA certificate. Similarly, the etcd CA redeployment playbook only redeploys the etcd CA certificate. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1463775[*BZ#1463775*])
