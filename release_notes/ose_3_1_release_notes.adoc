== Overview

OpenShift Enterprise by Red Hat is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that provides
developers and IT organizations with a cloud application platform for deploying
new applications on secure, scalable resources with minimal configuration and
management overhead. OpenShift Enterprise supports a wide selection of
programming languages and frameworks, such as Java, Ruby, and PHP.

Built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Google Kubernetes, OpenShift Enterprise
provides a secure and scalable multi-tenant operating system for today’s
enterprise-class applications, while providing integrated application runtimes
and libraries. OpenShift Enterprise brings the OpenShift PaaS platform to
customer data centers, enabling organizations to implement a private PaaS that
meets security, privacy, compliance, and governance requirements.

|===

Docker version update required::
Docker version 1.8.2 is required. This contains the fix to let the
*_/etc/groups_* file use supplementary groups.

LDAP Synchronization::
OpenShift now allows you to sync LDAP records with OpenShift, so that you can
manage groups easily.

F5 Availability::
You can now configure an F5 load-balancer for use with your OpenShift
environment.

More Persistent Storage Options::
Several persistent storage options are now available, such as Red Hat's
GlusterFS and Ceph RBD, AWS, and Google Compute Engine. Also, NFS storage is
now supplemented by iSCSI- and Fibre Channel-based volumes.

More Middleware Options::
Several middleware services are now available, such as JBoss DataGrid, and
JBoss BRMS, as well as a supported JBoss Developer Studio and Eclipse plug-in.

Job Controller Now Available::
The job object type is now available, meaning that finite jobs can now be
executed on the cluster.

Installation Utility Updates::
Multiple enhancements have been made to the Ansible-based installation
utility. The utility can now:
* Perform container-based installations. (Technology Preview)
* Install active-active, highly-available clusters.
* Uninstall existing OpenShift clusters.

Custom CA Certificates::
You can now specify your own CA certificate during the install, so that
application developers do not have to specify the OpenShift-generated CA to
obtain secure connections.

DNS Service Name Change::
The DNS name for service SRV discovery has changed. Services without search paths resulted in long load times to resolve DNS. The change reduces load times.

New Parameter Preventing Memory Overload::
Excessive amounts of events being stored in etcd can lead to excessive memory
growth. You can now set the `*event-ttl*` parameter in the master
configuration file to a lower value (for example, `*15m*`) to prevent memory
growth.

New Parameter for Port Destination::
You can now specify the port to send routes to. Any services that are
pointing to multiple ports should have the `*spec.port.targetPort*` parameter
on the pod set to the desired port.

New Remote Access Command::
The `oc rsync` command is now available, which can copy local directories into
a remote pod.

Project Binding Command::
Isolated projects can now be bound together using `oadm pod-network
join-project`.

Host Configuration Validation Commands::
New commands exist to validate master and node configuration files: `openshift
ex validate master-config` and `openshift ex validate node-config`, respectively.

New Tag Deletion Command::
You can now delete tags from an image stream using the `oc tag <tag_name> -d`
command.

New Overcommit Abilities::
You can now create containers that can specify compute resource requests and
limits. Requests are used for scheduling your container and provide a minimum
service guarantee. Limits constrain the amount of compute resource that may be
consumed on your node.

CPU Limits Now Enforced Using CFS Quota by Default::
If you wish to disable CFS quota enforcement, you may disable it by modifying
your *_node-config.yaml_* file to specify a `*kubeletArguments*` stanza where
`*cpu-cfs-quota*` is set to *false*.

.For Developers:
`*v1beta3*` no Longer Supported::
Using `*v1beta3*` in configuration files is no longer supported:
* The `*etcdStorageConfig.kubernetesStorageVersion*` and
`*etcdStorageConfig.openShiftStorageVersion*` values in the master
configuration file must be `*v1*`.
* You may also need to change the `*apiLevels*` field and remove `*v1beta3*`.
* `*v1beta3*` is no longer supported as an endpoint. `*/api/v1beta3*` and
`*/osapi/v1beta3*` are now disabled.

Web Console Enhancements::
Multiple web console enhancements:
* Extended resource information is now available on the web console.
* The ability to trigger a deployment and rollback from the console has been
added.
* Logs for builds and pods are now displayed on the web console in real time.
* When enabled, the web console will now display pod metrics.
* You can now connect to a container using a remote shell connection when in
the *Builds* tab.

Aggregating Logging With the EFK Stack::
Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (together, known as the EFK stack) are now available for logging consumption.

Heapster Now Available::
The Heapster interface and metric datamodel can now be used with OpenShift.

Jenkins is Now Available::
* A Jenkins image is now available for deployment on OpenShift.
* Integration between Jenkins masters and Jenkins slaves running on OpenShift
has improved.

`oc build-logs` is Now Deprecated::
The `oc build-logs <build_name>` command is now deprecated and replaced by `oc
logs build/<build_name>`.

`*spec.rollingParams.updatePercent*` Field is Replaced::
The `*spec.rollingParams.updatePercent*` field in deployment configurations
has been replaced with `*maxUnavailable*` and `*maxSurge*`.

Images now Editable::
Images can be edited to set fields such as `*labels*` or `*annotations*`.

== Bug Fixes

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1264836[BZ 1264836]:: Previously,
the upgrade script used an incorrect image to upgrade the HAProxy router. The
script now uses the right image.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1264765[BZ 1264765]:: Previously, an
upgrade would fail when a defined image stream or template did not exist. Now,
the installation utility skips the incorrectly defined image stream or
template and continues with the upgrade.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1274134[BZ 1274134]:: When using
the `oc new-app` command with the `--insecure-registry` option, it would not
set if the Docker daemon was not running. This issue has been fixed.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1273975[BZ 1273975]:: Using the `oc
edit` command on Windows machines displayed errors with wrapping and file
changes. These issues have been fixed.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1268891[BZ 1268891]:: Previously,
creating pods from the same image in the same service and deployment were not
grouped into another service. Now, pods created with the same image run in the
same service and deployment, grouped together.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1267559[BZ 1267559]:: Previously,
using the `oc export` command could produce an error, and the export would
fail. This issue has been fixed.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1266981[BZ 1266981]:: The recycler
would previously fail if hidden files or directories would be present. This

[[ose-31-technology-preview]]

== Technology Preview Features

Some features in this release are currently in Technology Preview. These
experimental features are not intended for production use. Please note the
following scope of support on the Red Hat Customer Portal for these features:

https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview
Features Support Scope]

The following features are in Technology Preview:

* Binary builds, and the Dockerfile source type for builds.
* Pod autoscaling, using the *HorizontalPodAutoscaler* object. OpenShift compares pod CPU usage as a percentage of requested CPU, and scales according to up to an indicated threshold.
* Support for OpenShift Enterprise running on Atomic Host.
* Containerized installations, meaning all OpenShift Enterprise components running in containers.

== Known Issues

* When pushing to an internal registry when multiple registries share the same
NFS volume, there is a chance the push will fail.
link:../install_config/install/docker_registry.html#registry-known-issues[A
workaround] has been suggested.
* When creating a build, in the event where there are not enough resources
(possibly due to quota), the build will be pending indefinitely. As a
workaround, free up resources, cancel the build, then start a new build.
