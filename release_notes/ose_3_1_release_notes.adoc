== Overview

OpenShift Enterprise by Red Hat is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that provides
developers and IT organizations with a cloud application platform for deploying
new applications on secure, scalable resources with minimal configuration and
management overhead. OpenShift Enterprise supports a wide selection of
programming languages and frameworks, such as Java, Ruby, and PHP.

Built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Google Kubernetes, OpenShift Enterprise
provides a secure and scalable multi-tenant operating system for todayâ€™s
enterprise-class applications, while providing integrated application runtimes
and libraries. OpenShift Enterprise brings the OpenShift PaaS platform to
customer data centers, enabling organizations to implement a private PaaS that
meets security, privacy, compliance, and governance requirements.

== New Features and Enhancements

OpenShift Enterprise version 3.1 is now available. Ensure that you follow the
instructions on upgrading your OpenShift cluster properly, including steps
specific to this release.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any release, always review xref:../install_config/upgrading/index.adoc#install-config-upgrading-index[Installation
and Configuration] for instructions on
xref:../install_config/upgrading/index.adoc#install-config-upgrading-index[upgrading your OpenShift cluster] properly,
including any additional steps that may be required for a specific release.
====

.For Administrators:
Service, Package, File, and Directory Names Changed::

[cols="4,6",options="header"]
|===
|Previous Name
|New Name

|*openshift-master*
|*atomic-openshift-master*

|*openshift-node*
|*atomic-openshift-node*

|*_/etc/openshift/_*
|*_/etc/origin/_*

|*_/var/lib/openshift/_*

|*_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master_*

|*_/etc/sysconfig/openshift-node_*
|*_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-node_*
|===

Docker Version Update Required::
Docker version 1.8.2 is required. This contains the fix to let the
*_/etc/groups_* file use supplementary groups.

LDAP Synchronization::
OpenShift now allows you to sync LDAP records with OpenShift, so that you can
manage groups easily.

F5 Availability::
You can now configure an F5 load-balancer for use with your OpenShift
environment.

More Persistent Storage Options::
Several persistent storage options are now available, such as Red Hat's
GlusterFS and Ceph RBD, AWS, and Google Compute Engine. Also, NFS storage is
now supplemented by iSCSI- and Fibre Channel-based volumes.

More Middleware Options::
Several middleware services are now available, such as JBoss DataGrid, and
JBoss BRMS, as well as a supported JBoss Developer Studio and Eclipse plug-in.

Job Controller Now Available::
The job object type is now available, meaning that finite jobs can now be
executed on the cluster.

Installer Updates::
Multiple enhancements have been made to the Ansible-based installer. The
installer can now:
* Perform container-based installations. (Fully supported starting in
xref:ose-3-1-1[OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.1])
* Install active-active, highly-available clusters.
* Uninstall existing OpenShift clusters.

Custom CA Certificates::
You can now specify your own CA certificate during the install, so that
application developers do not have to specify the OpenShift-generated CA to
obtain secure connections.

DNS Service Name Change::
The DNS name for service SRV discovery has changed. Services without search
paths resulted in long load times to resolve DNS. The change reduces load times.

New Parameter Preventing Memory Overload::
Excessive amounts of events being stored in etcd can lead to excessive memory
growth. You can now set the `*event-ttl*` parameter in the master
configuration file to a lower value (for example, `*15m*`) to prevent memory
growth.

New Parameter for Port Destination::
You can now specify the port to send routes to. Any services that are
pointing to multiple ports should have the `*spec.port.targetPort*` parameter
on the pod set to the desired port.

New Remote Access Command::
The `oc rsync` command is now available, which can copy local directories into
a remote pod.

Project Binding Command::
Isolated projects can now be bound together using `oadm pod-network
join-project`.

Host Configuration Validation Commands::
New commands exist to validate master and node configuration files: `openshift
ex validate master-config` and `openshift ex validate node-config`, respectively.

New Tag Deletion Command::
You can now delete tags from an image stream using the `oc tag <tag_name> -d`
command.

New Overcommit Abilities::
You can now create containers that can specify compute resource requests and
limits. Requests are used for scheduling your container and provide a minimum
service guarantee. Limits constrain the amount of compute resource that may be
consumed on your node.

CPU Limits Now Enforced Using CFS Quota by Default::
If you wish to disable CFS quota enforcement, you may disable it by modifying
your *_node-config.yaml_* file to specify a `*kubeletArguments*` stanza where
`*cpu-cfs-quota*` is set to *false*.

.For Developers:
`*v1beta3*` no Longer Supported::
Using `*v1beta3*` in configuration files is no longer supported:
* The `*etcdStorageConfig.kubernetesStorageVersion*` and
`*etcdStorageConfig.openShiftStorageVersion*` values in the master
configuration file must be `*v1*`.
* You may also need to change the `*apiLevels*` field and remove `*v1beta3*`.
* `*v1beta3*` is no longer supported as an endpoint. `*/api/v1beta3*` and
`*/osapi/v1beta3*` are now disabled.

Web Console Enhancements::
Multiple web console enhancements:
* Extended resource information is now available on the web console.
* The ability to trigger a deployment and rollback from the console has been
added.
* Logs for builds and pods are now displayed on the web console in real time.
* When enabled, the web console will now display pod metrics.
* You can now connect to a container using a remote shell connection when in
the *Builds* tab.

Aggregating Logging with the EFK Stack::
Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (together, known as the EFK stack) are now
available for logging consumption.

Heapster Now Available::
The Heapster interface and metric datamodel can now be used with OpenShift.

Jenkins Is Now Available::
* A Jenkins image is now available for deployment on OpenShift.
* Integration between Jenkins masters and Jenkins slaves running on OpenShift
has improved.

`oc build-logs` Is Now Deprecated::
The `oc build-logs <build_name>` command is now deprecated and replaced by `oc
logs build/<build_name>`.

`*spec.rollingParams.updatePercent*` Field Is Replaced::
The `*spec.rollingParams.updatePercent*` field in deployment configurations
has been replaced with `*maxUnavailable*` and `*maxSurge*`.

Images Now Editable::
Images can be edited to set fields such as `*labels*` or `*annotations*`.

== Bug Fixes

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1264836[BZ#1264836]:: Previously,
the upgrade script used an incorrect image to upgrade the HAProxy router. The
script now uses the right image.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1264765[BZ#1264765]:: Previously, an
upgrade would fail when a defined image stream or template did not exist. Now,
the installation utility skips the incorrectly defined image stream or
template and continues with the upgrade.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1274134[BZ#1274134]:: When using
the `oc new-app` command with the `--insecure-registry` option, it would not

experimental features are not intended for production use. Please note the
following scope of support on the Red Hat Customer Portal for these features:

https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview
Features Support Scope]

The following features are in Technology Preview:

* Binary builds and the Dockerfile source type for builds. (Fully supported
starting in xref:ose-3-1-1[OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.1])
* Pod autoscaling, using the `*HorizontalPodAutoscaler*` object. OpenShift
compares pod CPU usage as a percentage of requested CPU and scales according
to an indicated threshold. (Fully supported starting in
xref:ose-3-1-1[OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.1])
* Support for OpenShift Enterprise running on RHEL Atomic Host. (Fully supported
starting in xref:ose-3-1-1[OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.1])
* Containerized installations, meaning all OpenShift Enterprise components
running in containers. (Fully supported starting in xref:ose-3-1-1[OpenShift
Enterprise 3.1.1])

[[ose-31-known-issues]]
== Known Issues

* When pushing to an internal registry when multiple registries share the same
NFS volume, there is a chance the push will fail.
xref:../install_config/install/docker_registry.adoc#registry-known-issues[A
workaround] has been suggested.
* When creating a build, in the event where there are not enough resources
(possibly due to quota), the build will be pending indefinitely. As a
workaround, free up resources, cancel the build, then start a new build.

[[ose-31-asynchronous-errata-updates]]

[[ose-3-1-1-enhancements]]
==== Enhancements

Containerized Installations Now Fully Supported::
Installation of OpenShift Enterprise master and node components as containerized
services, added as Technology Preview in OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.0, is now
fully supported as an alternative to the standard RPM method. Both the
xref:../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[quick] and
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installation]
methods support use of the containerized method. See
xref:../install_config/install/rpm_vs_containerized.adoc#install-config-install-rpm-vs-containerized[RPM vs Containerized]
for more details on the differences when running as a containerized
installation.

RHEL Atomic Host Now Fully Supported::
Installing OpenShift Enterprise on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Atomic Host
7.1.6 or later, added as Technology Preview in OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.0, is
now fully supported for running containerized OpenShift services. See
xref:../install_config/install/prerequisites.adoc#system-requirements[System
Requirements] for more details.

Binary Builds and Dockerfile Sources Now Fully Supported::
xref:../dev_guide/builds.adoc#binary-source[Binary builds] and the
xref:../dev_guide/builds.adoc#dockerfile-source[Dockerfile source type] for
builds, added as Technology Preview in OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.0, are now fully
supported.

Pod Autoscaling Now Fully Supported::
xref:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.adoc#dev-guide-pod-autoscaling[Pod autoscaling] using the
`*HorizontalPodAutoscaler*` object, added as Technology Preview in OpenShift
Enterprise 3.1.0, is now fully supported. OpenShift compares pod CPU usage as a
percentage of requested CPU and scales according to an indicated threshold.

Web Console::
* When creating an application from source in the web console, you can
independently specify build environment variables and deployment environment
variables on the creation page. Build environment variables created in this
way also become available at runtime.
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1280216[*BZ#1280216*])
* When creating an application from source in the web console, all container
ports are now exposed on the creation page under "Routing".
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1247523[*BZ#1247523*])
* Build trends are shown on the build configuration overview page.
* Individual build configurations and deployment configurations can be deleted.
* Any object in the web console can be edited like `oc edit` with a direct YAML
editor, for when you need to tweak rarely used fields.
* The experience around web console scaling has been improved with more
information.
* Empty replication controllers are shown in the Overview when they are not part
of a service.
* Users can dismiss web console alerts.

Command Line::
* `oc status` now shows suggestions and warnings about conditions it detects in
the current project.
* `oc start-build` now allows `--env` and `--build-loglevel` to be passed as
arguments.
* `oc secret` now allows custom secret types to be created.
* Secrets can be created for Docker configuration files using the new
*_.docker/config.json_* format with the following syntax:
+
----
$ oc secrets new <secret_name> .dockerconfigjson=[path/to/].docker/config.json
----
+
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1282426[*BZ#1282426*])
* `oc new-build` now supports the `--to` flag, which allows you to specify which
image stream tag you want to push a build to. You can pass `--to-docker` to
push to an external image registry. If you only want to test the build, pass
`--no-output` which only ensures that the build passes.

Security::
* The user name of the person requesting a new project is now available to
parameterize the initial project template as the parameter
`*PROJECT_REQUESTING_USER*`.
* When creating a new application from a Docker image, a warning occurs if the
image does not specify a user that administrators may have disabled running as
root inside of containers.
* Add a new role *system:image-pusher* that allows pushing images to the
integrated registry.
* Deleting a cluster role from the command line now deletes all role bindings
associated to that role unless you pass the `--cascade=false` option.

API Changes::
* You can delete a tag using `DELETE
/oapi/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/imagestreamtags/<steam>:<tag>`.
* It is no longer valid to set route TLS configuration without also specifying a
termination type. A default has been set for the type to be `terminate` if the
user provided TLS certificates.
* Docker builds can now be configured with custom *_Dockerfile_* paths.

Miscellaneous::
* The integrated Docker registry has been updated to version 2.2.1.
* The LDAP group prune and sync commands have been promoted out of experimental
and into `oadm groups`.
* More tests and configuration warnings have been added to `openshift ex
diagnostics`.
* Builds are now updated with the Git commit used in a build after the build
completes.
* Routers now support overriding the host value in a route at startup. You can
start multiple routers and serve the same route over different wildcards (with
different configurations). See the help text for `openshift-router`.

Deleting users and groups cascades to delete their role bindings across the
cluster.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1289603[*BZ#1289603*]::
In clustered etcd environments, user logins could fail with a 401 Unauthorized
error due to stale reads from etcd. This bug fix updates OpenShift to wait for
access tokens to propagate to all etcd cluster members before returning the
token to the user.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1280497[*BZ#1280497*]::
OpenShift Enterprise now supports DWARF debugging.

user other than `git`.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1278232[*BZ#1278232*]::
When a build fails to start because of quota limits, if the quota is increased,
the build is now handled correctly and starts.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1287943[*BZ#1287943*]::
When canceling a build within a few seconds of entering the running state, the
build is now correctly marked "Cancelled" instead of "Failed".

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1287414[*BZ#1287414*]::
The example syntax in the help text for `oc attach` has been fixed.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1284506[*BZ#1284506*]::
The man page for the `tuned-profiles-atomic-openshift-node` command was missing,

An event is now created with an accompanying error message when a deployment
cannot be created due to a quota limit.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1292621[*BZ#1292621*]::
The default templates for Jenkins, MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL incorrectly
pointed to CentOS images instead of the correct RHEL-based image streams. These
templates have been fixed.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1289965[*BZ#1289965*]::
An out of range panic issue has been fixed in the OpenShift SDN.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1277329[*BZ#1277329*]::

OpenShift for several days. Several memory leaks have since been fixed to
address this issue.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1254880[*BZ#1254880*]::
The Kubelet exposes statistics from cAdvisor securely using cluster permissions
to view metrics, enabling secure communication for Heapster metric collection.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1293251[*BZ#1293251*]::
A bug was fixed in which service endpoints could not be accessed reliably by IP
address between different nodes.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1277383[*BZ#1277383*]::
When the *ovs-multitenant* plug-in is enabled, creating and deleting an
application could previously leave behind OVS rules and a veth pair on the OVS
bridge. Errors could be seen when checking the OVS interface. This bug fix
ensures that ports for the deleted applications are properly removed.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1290967[*BZ#1290967*]::
If a node was under heavy load, it was possible for the node host subnet to not
get created properly during installation. This bug fix bumps the timeout wait
from 10 to 30 seconds to avoid the issue.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1279925[*BZ#1279925*]::
Various improvements have been made to ensure that OpenShift SDN can be
installed and started properly.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1282738[*BZ#1282738*]::
The MySQL image can now handle if handle `*MYSQL_USER=root*` is set. However, an
error is produced if you set `*MYSQL_USER=root*` and also `*MYSQL_PASSWORD*` and
`*MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD*` at the same time.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1283952[*BZ#1283952*]::
The default HAProxy "503" response lacked response headers, resulting in an
invalid HTTP response. The response headers have been updated to fix this issue.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1290643[*BZ#1290643*]::
HAProxy's "Forwarded" header value is now RFC 7239 compliant.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1279744[*BZ#1279744*]::
The default strategies for cluster SCCs have been changed to *RunAsAny* for
`*FSGroup*` and `*SupplementalGroups*`, to retain backwards compatible behavior.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1273739[*BZ#1273739*]::
When creating a PV and PVC for a Cinder volume, it was possible for pods to not
be created successfully due to a "Cloud provider not initialized properly"
error. This has been fixed by ensuring that the related OpenShift instance ID is
properly cached and used for volume management.

[[ose-3-1-1-known-issues]]
==== Known Issues

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1293578[*BZ#1293578*]::
There was an issue with OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.1 where hosts with host names
that resolved to IP addresses that were not local to the host would run into
problems with liveness and readiness probes on newly-created HAProxy routers.
This was resolved in
https://access.redhat.com/errata/product/290/ver=3.1/rhel---7/x86_64/RHBA-2016:0293[RHBA-2016:0293]
by configuring the probes to use *localhost* as the hostname for pods with
`*hostPort*` values.

If you created a router under the affected version, and your liveness or
readiness probes unexpectedly fail for your router, then add *host: localhost*:

====
----
# oc edit dc/router

Apply the following changes:

spec:
 template:
    spec:
      containers:
      ...
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            host: localhost <1>
            path: /healthz
            port: 1936
            scheme: HTTP
          initialDelaySeconds: 10
          timeoutSeconds: 1
        ...
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            host: localhost <2>
            path: /healthz
            port: 1936
            scheme: HTTP
          timeoutSeconds: 1
----
<1> Add `host: localhost` to your liveness probe.
<2> Add `host: localhost` to your readiness probe.
