[id="ocp-4-7-about-this-release"]
== About this release

// TODO: Update k8s link once there is a version-specific URL for the Kubernetes release
(link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2020:1234[RHBA-2020:1234]) is now available. This release uses link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/[Kubernetes 1.20] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

//Red Hat did not publicly release {product-title} 4.6.0 as the GA version and, instead, is releasing {product-title} 4.6.1 as the GA version.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift. The {cloud-redhat-com} application for {product-title} allows you to deploy OpenShift clusters to either on-premise or cloud environments.

{product-title} {product-version} is supported on {op-system-base-full} 7.7 or later, as well as {op-system-first} 4.6.

You must use {op-system} machines for the control plane, which are also known as master machines, and you can use either {op-system} or {op-system-base-full} 7.7 or later for compute machines, which are also known as worker machines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because only {op-system-base-full} version 7.7 or later is supported for compute machines, you must not upgrade the {op-system-base} compute machines to version 8.
====

//{product-title} 4.6 is an Extended Update Support (EUS) release. More information on Red Hat OpenShift EUS is available in link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#ocp4_phases[OpenShift Life Cycle] and link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift-eus[OpenShift EUS Overview].

With the release of {product-title} 4.7, version 4.4 is now end of life. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy].

[id="ocp-4-7-inclusive-language"]
== Making open source more inclusive

Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language[Red Hat CTO Chris Wrightâ€™s message].

[id="ocp-4-7-new-features-and-enhancements"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

[id="ocp-4-7-rhcos"]
=== {op-system-first}

[id="ocp-4-7-enhanced-disk-provisioning"]
==== Enhanced disk provisioning for LUKS, RAID, and FBA DASD

{product-title} 4.7 includes several improvements to disk provisioning for bare metal deployments. The following features are currently supported for new 4.7 clusters only:

* Native Ignition support for LUKS disk encryption provides additional configurability for encrypted root filesystems, as well as support for encryption of additional data filesystems.
* {op-system} now supports boot disk mirroring, except on s390x, providing redundancy in the case of disk failure.
* {op-system} on s390x can be installed onto fixed-block architecture (FBA)-type direct access storage device (DASD) disks.

* Multipathing is now supported during initial deployment and early boot for storage devices when attached to clusters that are created using {product-title} 4.7 or higher.

[NOTE]
====
On new clusters, LUKS configuration must use the native Ignition mechanism, as provisioning fails if the legacy `/etc/clevis.json` file is included in the machine config. On clusters that are upgrading from {product-title} 4.6 or earlier, LUKS can only be configured by using `/etc/clevis.json`.
====

[id="ocp-4-7-bootupd"]
==== Update the bootloader by using `bootupd`

With `bootupd`, {op-system} users now have access to a cross-distribution, system-agnostic OS update tool that manages firmware and boot updates in UEFI and legacy BIOS boot modes that run on modern architectures.

[id="ocp-4-7-rhcos-rhel-8-3-packages"]
==== {op-system} now supports RHEL 8.3

{op-system} is now using Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.3 packages. {product-title} 4.6 and below will stay with RHEL 8.2 packages. This enables you to have the latest fixes, features, and enhancements, such as NetworkManager features, as well as the latest hardware support and driver updates.

[id="ocp-4-7-rhcos-kdump"]
==== {op-system} now supports `kdump` service (Technical Preview)
The `kdump` service is introduced in Technical Preview in {op-system} to provide a crash-dumping mechanism for debugging kernel issues. You can use this service to save system memory content for later analysis. The `kdump` service is not managed at the cluster-level and must be enabled and configured manually on a per-node basis.

[id="ocp-4-7-ignition"]
==== Ignition updates
The following Ignition updates are now available:

* {op-system} now supports Ignition config spec 3.2.0. This update provides support for disk partition resizing, LUKS encrypted storage, and `gs://` URLs.
* When executing in non-default AWS partitions, such as GovCloud or AWS China, Ignition now fetches `s3://` resources from the same partition.
* Ignition now supports AWS EC2 Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2).

[id="ocp-4-7-installation-and-upgrade"]
=== Installation and upgrade

[id="ocp-4-7-aws-c2s-secret-region"]
==== Installing a cluster into the AWS C2S Secret Region

You can now install a cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) into the Commercial Cloud Services (C2S) Secret Region. Because the C2S region does not have an {op-system} AMI published by Red Hat, you must upload a custom AMI that belongs to that region. You are also required to include the CA certificates for C2S in the `additionalTrustBundle` field of the `install-config.yaml` file during cluster installation. Clusters deployed to the C2S Secret Region do not have access to the Internet; therefore, you must configure a private image registry.

The installation program does not support destroying a cluster deployed to the C2S region; you must manually remove the resources of the cluster.

//Link for more info when available.

[id="ocp-4-7-gcp-disk-encryption"]
==== Installing cluster on GCP with disk encryption using a personal encryption key

You can now install a cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and use a personal encryption key to encrypt both virtual machines and persistent volumes. This is done by setting the `controlPlane.platform.gcp.osDisk.encryptionKey`, `compute.platform.gcp.osDisk.encryptionKey`, or `gcp.defaultMachinePlatform.osDisk.encryptionKey` field in the `install-config.yaml` file.

//Link for more info when available.

[id="ocp-4-7-web-console"]
=== Web console

[id="ocp-4-7-web-console-localization"]
==== Web console localization

The web console is now localized and provides language support for global users. English, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese are currently supported. The displayed language follows your browser preferences, but you can also select a language to override the browser default. From the *User* drop-down menu, select *Language preferences* to update your language setting. Localized date and time is now also supported.

[id="ocp-4-7-web-console-insights-plugin"]
==== Insights plug-in

The xref:../support/remote_health_monitoring/using-insights-to-identify-issues-with-your-cluster.adoc#displaying-the-insights-status-in-the-web-console_using-insights-to-identify-issues-with-your-cluster[Insights plug-in] is now integrated into the {product-title} web console. Insights provides cluster health data, such as the number of total issues and total risks of the issues. Risks are labeled as *Critical*, *Important*, *Moderate*, or *Low*. You can quickly navigate to {cloud-redhat-com} for further details about the issues and how to fix them.

[id="ocp-4-7-security"]
=== Security and compliance

[id="ocp-4-7-security-user-oauth-tokens"]
==== Managing user-owned OAuth access tokens

Users can now manage their own OAuth access tokens. This allows users to review their tokens and delete any tokens that have timed out or are no longer needed.

For more information, see xref:../authentication/managing-oauth-access-tokens.adoc#managing-oauth-access-tokens[Managing user-owned OAuth access tokens].

[id="ocp-4-7-security-cco-deletion-gcp-creds-mint-mode"]
==== Cloud Credential Operator support for deletion of GCP root credentials after installation

You can now remove or rotate the GCP admin-level credential that the xref:../operators/operator-reference.adoc#cloud-credential-operator_red-hat-operators[Cloud Credential Operator] uses in Mint mode. This option requires the presence of the admin-level credential during installation, but the credential is not stored in the cluster permanently and does not need to be long-lived.

[id="ocp-4-7-compliance-cis-benchmark"]
==== CIS Kubernetes Benchmark profile for the Compliance Operator

You can now use the Compliance Operator to perform Center for Internet Security (CIS) Kubernetes Benchmark checks. CIS profiles for {product-title} are based on the CIS Kubernetes checks.

[id="ocp-4-7-security-secure-boot"]
==== Secure Boot support for installer-provisioned clusters

You can now deploy a cluster with Secure Boot when using installer-provisioned infrastructure on bare metal nodes. Deploying a cluster with Secure Boot requires UEFI boot mode and Red Fish Virtual Media. You cannot use self-generated keys with Secure Boot.

[id="ocp-4-7-networking"]
=== Networking

[id="ocp-4-7-ovn-kubernetes-migration"]
==== Expanded platform support for migrating from the OpenShift SDN cluster network provider to the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network provider

A xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/migrate-from-openshift-sdn.adoc#migrate-from-openshift-sdn[migration to the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network provider] is now supported on installer-provisioned clusters on the following platforms:

* Bare metal hardware
* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* Microsoft Azure
* {rh-openstack-first}
* VMware vSphere

[id="ocp-4-7-ovn-kubernetes-egress-firewall-dns"]
==== OVN-Kubernetes egress firewall support for DNS rules

When configuring an egress firewall rule, you can now use a xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/configuring-egress-firewall-ovn.adoc#domain-name-server-resolution_configuring-egress-firewall-ovn[DNS domain name] instead of an IP address.
With the addition of DNS support in the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network provider egress firewall implementation, parity is achieved with the OpenShift SDN cluster network provider egress firewall implementation.

[id="ocp-4-7-sr-iov-dpdk-functions"]
==== Library for interacting with SR-IOV virtual functions in DPDK mode within containers

For containers interacting with SR-IOV virtual functions (VFs) in Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) mode, the `app-netutil` library now provides the following functions: `GetCPUInfo()`, `GetHugepages()`, and `GetInterfaces()`. For more information, see xref:../networking/hardware_networks/about-sriov.adoc#nw-sriov-app-netutil_about-sriov[DPDK library for use with container applications].

[id="ocp-4-7-ovn-kubernetes-egress-router-cni"]
==== Egress router CNI (Technical Preview)

The egress router CNI plug-in is introduced in Technical Preview. You can use the plug-in to deploy an egress router in redirect mode. This egress router provides parity for OVN-Kubernetes compared to OpenShift SDN, but for redirect mode only. The plug-in does not perform in HTTP proxy or DNS proxy modes, and this is a difference with the implementation for OpenShift SDN. For more information, see xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/deploying-egress-router-ovn-redirection.adoc[Deploying an egress router pod in redirect mode].

[id="ocp-4-7-ovn-kubernetes-ipsec-support"]
==== OVN-Kubernetes IPsec support for encrypted traffic between pods

When you install a cluster, you can configure the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network provider with IPsec enabled. With IPsec enabled, all cluster network traffic between pods is sent over an encrypted IPsec tunnel. You cannot enable or disable IPsec after cluster installation.

The IPsec tunnel is not used for network traffic between pods that are configured to use the host network. However, traffic sent from a pod on the host network and received by a pod that uses the cluster network does use the IPsec tunnel. For more information, see xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/about-ipsec-ovn.adoc#about-ipsec-ovn[IPsec encryption configuration].

[id="ocp-4-7-storage"]
=== Storage

[id="ocp-4-7-storage-csi-snapshots"]
==== Persistent storage using CSI volume snapshots is generally available

You can use the Container Storage Interface (CSI) to create, restore, and delete a volume snapshot when using CSI drivers that provide support for volume snapshots. This feature was previously introduced as a Technology Preview feature in {product-title} 4.4 and is now generally available and enabled by default in {product-title} 4.7.

For more information, see xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-snapshots.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-snapshots[Using CSI volume snapshots].

[id="ocp-4-5-persistent-storage-csi-gcp-pd"]
==== Persistent storage using the GCP PD CSI Driver Operator (Technology Preview)

The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) persistent disk (PD) CSI driver is automatically deployed and managed on GCP environments, allowing you to dynamically provision these volumes without having to install the driver manually. The GCP PD CSI Driver Operator that manages this driver is in Technology Preview.

For more information, see xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-gcp-pd.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-gcp-pd[GCP PD CSI Driver Operator].

[id="ocp-4-5-persistent-storage-csi-cinder"]
==== Persistent storage using the OpenStack Cinder CSI Driver Operator

You can now use CSI to provision a persistent volume using the CSI driver for OpenStack Cinder.

For more information, see xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-cinder.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-cinder[OpenStack Cinder CSI Driver Operator].

[id="ocp-4-7-storage-vsphere-problem-detector"]
==== vSphere Problem Detector Operator

The vSphere Problem Detector Operator periodically checks functionality of {product-title} clusters installed in a vSphere environment. The vSphere Problem Detector Operator is installed by default by the Cluster Storage Operator, allowing you to quickly identify and troubleshoot common storage issues, such as configuration and permissions, on vSphere clusters.

[id="ocp-4-7-registry"]
=== Registry

[id="ocp-4-7-registry-oci-support"]
==== Open Container Initiative images support

The {product-title} internal registry and image streams now support Open Container Initiative (OCI) images. You can use OCI images in the same way you would use Docker `schema2` images.

//Add link

[id="ocp-4-7-olm"]
=== Operator lifecycle

[id="ocp-4-7-safe-operator-upgrades"]
==== Safe Operator upgrades

To make upgrades more robust, it is recommend that Operators actively communicate with the service that is about to be updated. If a service is processing a critical operation, such as live migrating virtual machines (VMs) in OpenShift Virtualization or restoring a database, it might be unsafe to upgrade the related Operator at that time.

In {product-title} 4.7, Operators can take advantage of the new `OperatorCondition` resource to communicate a non-upgradeable state to Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), such as when a related service is performing a critical operation. The non-upgradeable state delays any pending Operator upgrade, whether automatically or manually approved, until the Operator finishes the operation and reports upgrade readiness.

See xref:../operators/understanding/olm/olm-operatorconditions.adoc#olm-operatorconditions[Operator conditions] for more about how OLM uses this communication channel.

See xref:../operators/admin/olm-managing-operatorconditions.adoc#olm-operatorconditions[Managing Operator conditions] for details on overriding states in OLM as a cluster administrator.

See xref:../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-generating-csvs.adoc#osdk-operatorconditions_osdk-generating-csvs[Enabling Operator conditions] for details on updating your project as an Operator developer to use the communication channel.

[id="ocp-4-7-pull-secrets-cs"]
==== Adding pull secrets to catalog sources

If certain images relevant to Operators managed by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) are hosted in an authenticated container image registry, also known as a private registry, OLM and OperatorHub are unable to pull the images by default. To enable access, you can create a pull secret that contains the authentication credentials for the registry.

By referencing one or more secrets in a catalog source, some of these required images can be pulled for use in OperatorHub, while other images require updates to the global cluster pull secret or namespace-scoped secrets.

See xref:../operators/admin/olm-managing-custom-catalogs.adoc#olm-accessing-images-private-registries_olm-managing-custom-catalogs[Accessing images for Operators from private registries] for more details.

[id="ocp-4-7-osdk"]
=== Operator development

[id="ocp-4-7-osdk-supported"]
==== Operator SDK now fully supported

As of {product-title} 4.7, the Operator SDK is now a fully supported Red Hat offering. With the downstream release of Operator SDK v1.3.0, officially supported and branded Operator SDK tooling is now available for download directly from Red Hat.

The Operator SDK CLI assists Operator developers and independent software vendor (ISV) partners in writing Operators that provide a great user experience and are compatible with OpenShift distributions and Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

The Operator SDK enables Operator authors with cluster administrator access to a Kubernetes-based cluster, such as {product-title}, to develop their own Operators based on Go, Ansible, or Helm. For Go-based Operators, link:https://kubebuilder.io/[Kubebuilder] is embedded into the SDK as the scaffolding solution; this means existing Kubebuilder projects can be used as is with the SDK and continue to work.

The following features highlight some of the capabilities of the Operator SDK:

Native support for Operator Bundle Format:: The Operator SDK includes native support for the xref:../operators/understanding/olm-packaging-format.adoc#olm-bundle-format_olm-packaging-format[Operator Bundle Format] introduced in {product-title} 4.6. All metadata required to package an Operator for OLM is generated automatically. Operator developers can use this functionality to package and test their Operator for OLM and OpenShift distributions directly from their CI pipelines.

Operator Lifecycle Manager integration:: The Operator SDK provides developers with a streamlined experience for quickly testing their Operator with OLM from their workstation. You can use the xref:../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-working-bundle-images.adoc#osdk-bundle-deploy-olm_osdk-working-bundle-images[`run bundle`] subcommand to run Operator on a cluster and test whether the Operator behaves correctly when managed by OLM.

Webhook integration:: The Operator SDK supports xref:../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-generating-csvs.adoc#olm-defining-csv-webhook_osdk-generating-csvs[webhook integration] with OLM, which simplifies installing Operators that have admission or custom resource definition (CRD) conversion webhooks. This feature relieves the cluster administrator of having to manually register the webhooks, add TLS certificates, and set up certificate rotation.

Validation scorecard:: Operator authors should validate that their Operator is packaged correctly and free of syntax errors. To validate an Operator, the xref:../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-scorecard.adoc#osdk-scorecard[scorecard tool] provided by the Operator SDK begins by creating all resources required by any related custom resources (CRs) and the Operator. The scorecard then creates a proxy container in the deployment of the Operator, which is used to record calls to the API server and run some of the tests. The tests performed also examine some of the parameters in the CRs.

Upgrade readiness reporting:: Operator developers can use the Operator SDK to take advantage of code scaffolding support for Operator conditions, including xref:../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-generating-csvs.adoc#osdk-operatorconditions_osdk-generating-csvs[reporting upgrade readiness] to OLM.

Trigger Operator upgrades:: You can quickly test upgrading your Operator by using OLM integration in the Operator SDK, without requiring you to manually manage index images and catalog sources. The xref:../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-working-bundle-images.adoc#osdk-bundle-upgrade-olm_osdk-working-bundle-images[`run bundle-upgrade`] subcommand automates triggering an installed Operator to upgrade to a later version by specifying a bundle image for the later version.

[NOTE]
====
Operator SDK v1.3.0 supports Kubernetes 1.19.

See xref:../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-about.adoc#osdk-about[Developing Operators] for full documentation on the Operator SDK.

=== Builds

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-7-buildah-version"]
// https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1907407
==== Print the buildah version to the build log

In the current version, when the {product-title} performs a build and the log level is five or higher, the cluster writes the buildah version information to the build log. This information helps Red Hat Engineering reproduce bug reports. Previously, this version information was not available in the build logs.

[id="ocp-4-7-machine-api"]
=== Machine API

[id="ocp-4-7-machine-api-wait-upgrade"]
==== Updates are immediately blocked if a machine config pool is degraded

If a machine config pool (MCP) is in a `degraded` state, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) now reports its *Upgradeable* status as *False*. As a result, you are now prevented from performing an update within a minor version, for example, from 4.7 to 4.8, until all machine config pools are healthy. Previously, with a degraded machine config pool, the Machine Config Operator did not report its *Upgradeable* status as *false*. The update was allowed and would eventually fail when updating the Machine Config Operator because of the degraded machine config pool. There is no change in this behavior for updates within z-stream releases, for example, from 4.7.1 to 4.7.2. As such, you should check the machine config pool status before performing a z-stream update.

[id="ocp-4-7-nodes"]
=== Nodes

[id="ocp-4-7-nodes-descheduler-ga"]
==== Descheduler is generally available

The descheduler is now generally available. The descheduler provides the ability to evict a running pod so that the pod can be rescheduled onto a more suitable node. You can enable one or more of the following descheduler profiles:

* `AffinityAndTaints`: evicts pods that violate inter-pod anti-affinity, node affinity, and node taints.
* `TopologyAndDuplicates`: evicts pods in an effort to evenly spread similar pods, or pods of the same topology domain, among nodes.
* `LifecycleAndUtilization`: evicts long-running pods and balances resource usage between nodes.

[NOTE]
====
With the GA, you can enable descheduler profiles and configure the descheduler interval. Any other settings that were available during Technology Preview are no longer available.
====

For more information, see xref:../nodes/scheduling/nodes-descheduler.adoc#nodes-descheduler[Evicting pods using the descheduler].

[id="ocp-4-7-nodes-scheduler-profiles"]
==== Scheduler profiles (Technology Preview)

You can now specify a scheduler profile to control how pods are scheduled onto nodes. This is a replacement for configuring a scheduler policy. The following scheduler profiles are available:

* `LowNodeUtilization`: This profile attempts to spread pods evenly across nodes to get low resource usage per node.

* `HighNodeUtilization`: This profile attempts to place as many pods as possible onto as few nodes as possible, to minimize node count with high usage per node.

* `NoScoring`: This is a low-latency profile that strives for the quickest scheduling cycle by disabling all score plug-ins. This might sacrifice better scheduling decisions for faster ones.

For more information, see xref:../nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-profiles.adoc#nodes-scheduler-profiles[Scheduling pods using a scheduler profile].

[id="ocp-4-7-nodes-autoscaling-ga"]
==== Autoscaling for memory utilization GA

Autoscaling for memory utilization is now generally available. You can create horizontal pod autoscaler custom resources to automatically scale the pods associated with a deployment config or replication controller to maintain the average memory utilization you specify, either a direct value or a percentage of requested memory. For more information, see xref:../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-autoscaling.html#nodes-pods-autoscaling-creating-memory_nodes-pods-autoscaling[Creating a horizontal pod autoscaler object for memory utilization].

[id="ocp-4-7-nodes-non-preempting-priority-classes"]
==== Non-preempting option for priority classes (Technology Preview)

You can now configure a priority class to be non-preempting by setting the `preemptionPolicy` field to `Never`. Pods with this priority class setting are placed in the scheduling queue ahead of lower priority pods, but do not preempt other pods.

For more information, see xref:../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-priority.html#non-preempting-priority-class_nodes-pods-priority[Non-preempting priority classes].

[id="ocp-4-7-eo-max-five-shards"]
// https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1883444
==== Maximum five primary shards per index

With this release, the Elasticsearch Operator (EO) sets the number of primary shards for an index between one and five, depending on the number of data nodes defined for a cluster.

Previously, the EO set the number of shards for an index to the number of data nodes. When an index in Elasticsearch was configured with a number of replicas, it created that many replicas for each primary shard, not per index. Therefore, as the index sharded, a greater number of replica shards existed in the cluster, which created a lot of overhead for the cluster to replicate and keep in sync.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-7-updated-eo-name"]
// https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1898920
==== Updated Elasticsearch Operator name and maturity level

==== Elasticsearch Operator reports on CSV success

This release adds reporting metrics to indicate that installing or upgrading the Elasticsearch Operator ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) was successful. Previously, there was no way to determine, or generate an alert, if the CSV installation or upgrade for the Elasticsearch Operator failed. Now, an alert is provided as part of the Elasticsearch Operator.

[id="ocp-4-7-curl-conn-timeout"]
// https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1881709
==== New connection timeout for deletion jobs

The current release adds a connection timeout for deletion jobs, which helps prevent pods from occasionally hanging when they query Elasticsearch to delete indices. Now, if the underlying 'curl' call does not connect before the timeout period elapses, the timeout terminates the call.

[id="ocp-4-7-monitoring-api-performance-dashboard"]
==== New API performance monitoring dashboard

The API performance dashboard is now available from the web console. This dashboard can be used to help troubleshoot performance issues with the Kubernetes API server or the OpenShift API server. You can access the API performance dashboard from the web console by navigating to *Monitoring* -> *Dashboards* and selecting the *API Performance* dashboard.

This dashboard provides API server metrics, such as:

* Request duration
* Request rate
* Request termination
* Requests in flight
* Requests aborted
* etcd request duration
* etcd object count
* Long-running requests
* Response status code
* Response size
* Priority and fairness

[id="ocp-4-7-scale-pao-disable-interrupt-processing"]
==== New `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` feature in Performance Addon Operator allows global device interrupt processing to be disabled for guaranteed pod CPUs

The Performance Addon Operator manages host CPUs by dividing them into reserved CPUs for cluster and operating system housekeeping duties, and isolated CPUs for workloads. A new performance profile field `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` is available to manage whether or not device interrupts are processed by the isolated CPU set.

New pod annotations `irq-load-balancing.crio.io` and `cpu-quota.crio.io` are used in conjunction with `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` to define whether or not device interrupts are processed for a pod. When configured, CRI-O disables device interrupts only as long as the pod is running.

* The top 100 `InstallPlan` entries to identify invalid Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) installations
* The service accounts from the Kubernetes default namespace and the `openshift*` built-in namespaces
* The `ContainerRuntimeConfig` and `MachineConfigPools` configuration files to verify container storage limits
* The configuration files for all available `operator.openshift.io` control pane resources to identify Operators in unmanaged states
* The `NetNamespaces` names, including their `netID` and egress IP addresses
* A list of all installed Operator Lifecycle Manager Operators, including version information
* The Persistent Volume definition, if used in the `openshift-image-registry` configuration
* Appearances of certain log entries of pods in the `openshift-apiserver-operator` namespace
* Appearances of certain log entries of `sdn` pods in the `openshift-sdn` namespace

With this additional information, Red Hat can provide improved remediation steps in {cloud-redhat-com}.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-7-olm-k8s-1-20"]
==== Operator Lifecycle Manager updated to use Kubernetes 1.20

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) strives to keep up to date with Kubernetes releases when they become available. The OLM-provided `ClusterServiceVersion` (CSV) resource is composed of a number of core Kubernetes resources. When OLM increments Kubernetes dependencies, the embedded resources are updated as well.

As of {product-title} 4.7, OLM and its associated components have been updated to use Kubernetes 1.20. Typically, Kubernetes is backwards compatible with a few of its previous versions. Operator authors are encouraged to keep their projects up to date to maintain compatibility and take advantage of updated resources.

See xref:../release_notes/versioning-policy.adoc#ocp-versioning-policy[OpenShift Container Platform Versioning Policy] for more specific details on backwards compatibility guarantees.

See link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/[Kubernetes documentation] for details about version skew policies in the upstream Kubernetes project.

==== Scheduler policy

Using a scheduler policy to control pod placement is deprecated and is planned for removal in a future release. For more information on the Technology Preview alternative, see xref:../nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-profiles.adoc#nodes-scheduler-profiles[Scheduling pods using a scheduler profile].

[id="ocp-4-7-filterbyos-deprecated"]
==== Catalog mirroring using filter-by-os flag

When using the `oc adm catalog mirror` command to mirror catalogs, the `--filter-by-os` flag was previously allowed to filter architectures of mirrored content. This would break references to those images in the catalog that point to the manifest list and not the manifest. The `--filter-by-os` flag now only filters the index image that is pulled and unpacked. To clarify this, the new `--index-filter-by-os` flag is now added and should be used instead.

The `--filter-by-os` flag is also now deprecated.

[id="ocp-4-7-removed-provisioningHostIP-and-bootstrapProvisioningIP"]
==== Installer-provisioned clusters no longer require provisioningHostIP or bootstrapProvisioningIP

When using installer-provisioned installation on bare metal nodes, {product-title} 4.6 required providing two IP addresses from the `baremetal` network to the `provisioningHostIP` and `bootstrapProvisioningIP` configuration settings when deploying without a `provisioning` network. These IP addresses and configuration settings are no longer required in {product-title} 4.7 when using installer provisioned infrastructure on bare metal nodes and deploying without a `provisioning` network.

[id="ocp-4-7-bug-fixes"]
== Bug fixes

*Bare Metal Hardware Provisioning*

* Previously, when trying to enable `baremetal` on assisted installer the `baremetal-operator` errors with `no bmc details`.  The Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) details can now be omitted for hosts in an unmanaged state. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1902653[*BZ#1902653*])

* Previously, when using virtual media on a Dell system, if the virtual media was already attached before the deployment commenced it would fail. Ironic now retries if this occurs. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1910739[*BZ#1910739*])

* Previously, master nodes were losing their link-local address on the provisioning interface preventing provisioning from working. A workaround has been added to `toggle addr_gen_mode` to prevent this from occurring. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1909682[*BZ#1909682*])

* Previously on some systems, the installer would communicate with Ironic before it was ready and fail. This is now prevented. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1915295[*BZ#1915295*])

*Networking*

* The code in `ovn-kube` that detects the default gateway was not taking into consideration multipath environments. As a result, Kubernetes nodes failed to start because they could not find the default gateway. The logic has been modified to consider the first available gateway if multipath is present. OVN-Kubernetes now works in environments with multipath and multiple default gateways. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1914250[*BZ#1914250*])

* When deploying a cluster in dual stack mode OVN-Kubernetes was using the wrong source of truth.
+
The OVN-Kubernetes master node performs an initial synchronization to keep OVN and Kubernetes system databases in sync. This issue resulted in race conditions on OVN-Kubernetes startup leading to some of the Kubernetes services becoming unreachable. Bootstrap logic deleted these services as they were considered orphans.
+
This bug fix ensures Kubernetes is used as the source of truth. OVN-Kubernetes now starts correctly and keeps both OVN and Kubernetes in sync on startup. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1915295[*BZ#1915295*])

*Installer*

* Previously when virtual-media was used, fast-track mode would not work as expected as nodes were rebooted between operations. This issue is now fixed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1893546[*BZ#1893546*])

* Previously when using dual stack deployments, worker node host names did not match the name inspected before deployment causing nodes to need manual approval. This is now fixed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1895909[*BZ#1895909*])

*Cluster Logging*

* Previously, logs were not sent to managed storage when legacy log forwarding was enabled. This happened because the internal generation of the `logforwarding` configuration improperly made a decision for  either `logforwarding` or legacy `logforwarding`. The current release fixes this issue:  Logs are sent to managed storage when the logstore is defined in the `clusterlogging` instance.  Additionally, logs are sent to legacy `logforwarding` when enabled regardless of whether a managed logstore is enabled or not. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1921263[*1921263*])

* Previously, the Fluentd collector pod went into a crash loop when the `ClusterLogForwarder` had an incorrectly-configured secret. The current release fixes this issue. Now, the `ClusterLogForwarder` validates the secrets and reports any errors in its status field. As a result, it does not cause the Fluentd collector pod to crash. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1888943[*1888943*])

* Previously, nodes did not recover from `Pending` status because a software bug did not correctly update their statuses in the Elasticsearch custom resource (CR). The current release fixes this issue, so the nodes can recover when their status is `Pending.` (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1887357[*BZ#1887357*])

* Previously, omitting the Storage size of the Elasticsearch node caused panic in the Elasticsearch Operator code. This panic appeared in the logs as: `Observed a panic: "invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference"` The panic happened because although Storage size is a required field, the software didn't check for it. The current release fixes this issue, so there is no panic if the storage size is omitted. Instead, the storage defaults to ephemeral storage and generates a log message for the user. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1899589[*BZ#1899589*])

* Previously, Elasticsearch rejected HTTP requests whose headers exceeded the default max header size, 8 KB. Now, the max header size is 128 KB, and Elasticsearch no longer rejects HTTP requests for exceeding the max header size. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1845293[*BZ#1845293*])

* Previously, when the Cluster Logging Operator (CLO) scaled down the number of Elasticsearch nodes in the `clusterlogging` CR to three nodes, it omitted previously-created nodes that had unique IDs. The Elasticsearch Operator rejected the update because it has safeguards that prevent nodes with unique IDs from being removed. Now, when the CLO scales down the number of nodes and updates the Elasticsearch CR, it marks nodes with unique IDs as count 0 instead of omitting them. As a result, users can scale down their cluster to 3 nodes by using the `clusterlogging` CR. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1879150[*BZ#1879150*])

* Previously, the Elasticsearch rollover pods failed with a `resource_already_exists_exception` error. Within the Elasticsearch rollover API, when the next index was created, the `*-write` alias was not updated to point to it. As a result, the next time the rollover API endpoint was triggered for that particular index, it received an error that the resource already existed.
+
The current release fixes this issue. Now, when a rollover occurs in the `indexmanagement` cronjobs, if a new index was created, it verifies that the alias points to the new index. This behavior prevents the error. If the cluster is already receiving this error, a cronjob fixes the issue so that subsequent runs work as expected. Now, performing rollovers no longer produces the exception. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1893992[*BZ#1893992*])

* Previously, if you updated the Kibana resource configuration in the `clusterlogging` instance to `resource{}`, the resulting nil map caused a panic and changed the status of the Elasticsearch Operator to `CrashLoopBackOff`. The current release fixes this issue by initializing the map. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1889573[*BZ#1889573*])

* Previously, if you deleted a Kibana route, the Cluster Logging Operator (CLO) could not recover or recreate it. Now, the CLO watches the route, and if you delete the route, the Elasticsearch Operator can reconcile or recreate it. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1890825[*BZ#1890825*])

* Previously, `elasticsearch-rollover` and `elasticsearch-delete` pods remained in the `Invalid JSON:` or `ValueError: No JSON object could be decoded` error states. This exception was raised because there was no exception handler for invalid JSON input. The current release fixes this issue by providing a handler for invalid JSON input. As a result, the handler outputs an error message instead of an exception traceback, and the `elasticsearch-rollover` and `elasticsearch-delete` jobs do not remain those error states. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1899905[*BZ#1899905*])

* Previously, in some cases, the Red Hat OpenShift Logging/Elasticsearch dashboard was missing from the {product-title} monitoring dashboard because the dashboard configuration resource referred to a different namespace owner and caused the {product-title} to garbage-collect that resource. Now, the ownership reference is removed from the Elasticsearch Operator reconciler configuration, and the logging dashboard appears in the console. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1910259[*BZ#1910259*])

* Previously, Fluent stopped sending logs even though the logging stack seemed functional. Logs were not shipped to an endpoint for an extended period even when an endpoint came back up. This happened if the max backoff time was too long and the endpoint was down. The current release fixes this issue by lowering the max backoff time, so the logs are shipped sooner. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1894634[*BZ#1894634*])

* Previously, if you deleted the secret, it was not recreated. Even though the certificates were on a disk local to the operator, they weren't rewritten because they hadn't changed. That is, certificates were only written if they changed. The current release fixes this issue. It rewrites the secret if the certificate changes or is not found. Now, if you delete the master-certs, they are replaced. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1901869[*BZ#1901869*])

* An earlier bug fix to address issues related to certificate generation introduced an error. Trying to read the certificates caused them to be regenerated because they were recognized as missing. This, in turn, triggered the Elasticsearch operator to perform a rolling upgrade on the Elasticsearch cluster and, potentially, to have mismatched certificates. This bug was caused by the operator incorrectly writing certificates to the working directory. The current release fixes this issue. Now the operator consistently reads and writes certificates to the same working directory, and the certificates are only regenerated if needed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1905910[*BZ#1905910*])

* Previously, queries to the root endpoint to retrieve the Elasticsearch version received a 403 response. The 403 response broke any services that used this endpoint in prior releases. This error happened because non-administrative users did not have the `monitor` permission required to query the root endpoint and retrieve the Elasticsearch version. Now, non-administrative users can query the root endpoint for the deployed version of Elasticsearch. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1906765[*BZ#1906765*])

*Builds*

* Previously, Dockerfile builds could not change permissions of the `/etc/pki/ca-trust` directory or create files inside it. This issue was caused by fixing link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1826183[*BZ#1826183*] in version 4.6, which added support for HTTPS proxies with CAs for builds and *always* mounted `/etc/pki/ca-trust`, which prevented builds that included their own CAs or modified the system trust store from working correctly at runtime. The current release fixes this issue by reverting Bug 1826183. Now, builder images that include their own CAs work again. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1891759[*BZ#1891759*])

* Previously, after upgrading from {product-title} version 4.5 to version 4.6, running `git clone` from a private repository failed because builds did not add proxy information to the Git configuration that was used to pull the source code. As a result, the source code could not be pulled if the cluster used a global proxy and the source was pulled from a private Git repository. Now, Git is configured correctly when the cluster uses a global proxy and the `git clone` command can pull source code from a private Git repository if the cluster uses a global proxy. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1896446[*BZ#1896446*])

* Previously, the node pull secret feature did not work: node pull secrets were not used if `forcePull: true` was set in the Source and Docker strategy builds. As a result, builds failed to pull images that required the cluster-wide pull secret. Now, node pull secrets are always merged with user-provided pull secrets. As a result, builds can pull images when `forcePull: true` is set, and the source registry requires the cluster-wide pull secret. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1883803[*BZ#1883803*])

* Previously, {product-title} builds failed on `git clone` when SCP-style SSH locations were specified because of Golang URL parsing, which does not accommodate Git SCP-styled SSH locations. As a result, {product-title} builds and Source-to-Image (S2I) failed when those types of source URLs were supplied. Now, builds and S2I bypass Golang URL parsing and strip the `ssh://` prefix to accommodate Git SCP-styled SSH locations (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1884270[*BZ#1884270*])

*Node Tuning Operator*

* When an invalid Tuned profile is created, the `openshift-tuned` supervisor process may ignore future profile updates and fail to apply the updated profile. This bug fix keeps state information about Tuned profile application success or failure. Now `openshift-tuned` recovers from profile application failures on receiving new valid profiles. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1919970[*BZ#1919970*])

[id="ocp-4-7-known-issues"]
== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.7 and beyond!
* In {product-title} 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.
+
If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.1 to 4.7, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. It is recommended to revoke unauthenticated access unless there is a specific need for it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP `403` errors if you revoke unauthenticated access.
====
+
Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:
+
[source,bash]
----
## Snippet to remove unauthenticated group from all the cluster role bindings
$ for clusterrolebinding in cluster-status-binding discovery system:basic-user system:discovery system:openshift:discovery ;
do
### Find the index of unauthenticated group in list of subjects
index=$(oc get clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} -o json | jq 'select(.subjects!=null) | .subjects | map(.name=="system:unauthenticated") | index(true)');
### Remove the element at index from subjects array
oc patch clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} --type=json --patch "[{'op': 'remove','path': '/subjects/$index'}]";
done
----
+
This script removes unauthenticated subjects from the following cluster role bindings:
+
--
** `cluster-status-binding`
** `discovery`
** `system:basic-user`
** `system:discovery`
** `system:openshift:discovery`
--
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821771[*BZ#1821771*])

* {op-system} real time (RT) kernels are currently only supported on compute nodes, not control plane nodes. Compact clusters are not supported with RT kernels in {product-title} 4.7. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1887007[*BZ#1887007*])
* Upgrading Performance Addon Operator from 4.6 to 4.7 fails with the error:
+
[source,terminal]
----
"Warning  TooManyOperatorGroups  11m   operator-lifecycle-manager  csv created in namespace with multiple operatorgroups, can't pick one automatically"
----
+
Before upgrading, follow the procedure as described in xref:../scalability_and_performance/cnf-performance-addon-operator-for-low-latency-nodes.adoc#upgrading-performance-addon-operator-configured-for-a-specific-namespace_cnf-master[Upgrading Performance Addon Operator when previously installed to a specific namespace].
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1913826[*BZ#1913826*])

* Fluentd pods with the `ruby-kafka-1.1.0` and `fluent-plugin-kafka-0.13.1` gems are not compatible with Apache Kafka version 0.10.1.0.
+
As a result, log forwarding to Kafka fails with a message: `error_class=Kafka::DeliveryFailed error="Failed to send messages to flux-openshift-v4/1"`
+
The `ruby-kafka-0.7` gem dropped support for Kafka 0.10 in favor of native support for Kafka 0.11. The `ruby-kafka-1.0.0` gem added support for Kafka 2.3 and 2.4. The current version of OpenShift Logging tests and therefore supports Kafka version 2.4.1.
+
To work around this issue, upgrade to a supported version of Apache Kafka.
