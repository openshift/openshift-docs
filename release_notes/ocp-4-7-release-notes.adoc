[id="ocp-4-7-about-this-release"]
== About this release

// TODO: Update k8s link once there is a version-specific URL for the Kubernetes release
(link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2020:1234[RHBA-2020:1234]) is now available. This release uses link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/[Kubernetes 1.20] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

//Red Hat did not publicly release {product-title} 4.6.0 as the GA version and, instead, is releasing {product-title} 4.6.1 as the GA version.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift. The {cloud-redhat-com} application for {product-title} allows you to deploy OpenShift clusters to either on-premise or cloud environments.

{product-title} {product-version} is supported on {op-system-base-full} 7.7 or later, as well as {op-system-first} 4.6.

You must use {op-system} machines for the control plane, which are also known as master machines, and you can use either {op-system} or {op-system-base-full} 7.7 or later for compute machines, which are also known as worker machines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because only {op-system-base-full} version 7.7 or later is supported for compute machines, you must not upgrade the {op-system-base} compute machines to version 8.
====

//{product-title} 4.6 is an Extended Update Support (EUS) release. More information on Red Hat OpenShift EUS is available in link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#ocp4_phases[OpenShift Life Cycle] and link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift-eus[OpenShift EUS Overview].

With the release of {product-title} 4.7, version 4.4 is now end of life. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy].

[id="ocp-4-7-new-features-and-enhancements"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

[id="ocp-4-7-rhcos"]
=== {op-system-first}


[id="ocp-4-7-installation-and-upgrade"]
=== Installation and upgrade

[id="ocp-4-7-aws-c2s-secret-region"]
==== Installing a cluster into the AWS C2S Secret Region

You can now install a cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) into the Commercial Cloud Services (C2S) Secret Region. Because the C2S region does not have an {op-system} AMI published by Red Hat, you must upload a custom AMI that belongs to that region. You are also required to include the CA certificates for C2S in the `additionalTrustBundle` field of the `install-config.yaml` file during cluster installation. Clusters deployed to the C2S Secret Region do not have access to the Internet; therefore, you must configure a private image registry.

The installation program does not support destroying a cluster deployed to the C2S region; you must manually remove the resources of the cluster.

//Link for more info when available.

[id="ocp-4-7-gcp-disk-encryption"]
==== Installing cluster on GCP with disk encryption using a personal encryption key

You can now install a cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and use a personal encryption key to encrypt both virtual machines and persistent volumes. This is done by setting the `controlPlane.platform.gcp.osDisk.encryptionKey`, `compute.platform.gcp.osDisk.encryptionKey`, or `gcp.defaultMachinePlatform.osDisk.encryptionKey` field in the `install-config.yaml` file.

//Link for more info when available.

[id="ocp-4-7-web-console"]
=== Web console

[id="ocp-4-7-web-console-localization"]
==== Web console localization

The web console is now localized and provides language support for global users. English, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, and Korean are currently supported. The displayed language follows your browser preferences, but you can also select a language to override the browser default. From the *Admin* drop-down menu, select *Language preferences* to update your language setting. Localized date and time is now also supported.

[id="ocp-4-7-web-console-insights-plugin"]
==== Insights plug-in

The xref:../support/remote_health_monitoring/using-insights-to-identify-issues-with-your-cluster.adoc#displaying-the-insights-status-in-the-web-console_using-insights-to-identify-issues-with-your-cluster[Insights plug-in] is now integrated into the {product-title} web console. Insights provides cluster health data, such as the number of total issues and total risks of the issues. Risks are labeled as *Critical*, *Important*, *Moderate*, or *Low*. You can quickly navigate to {cloud-redhat-com} for further details about the issues and how to fix them.

[id="ocp-4-7-security"]
=== Security and compliance

[id="ocp-4-7-cco-deletion-gcp-creds-mint-mode"]
==== Cloud Credential Operator support for deletion of GCP root credentials after installation

You can now remove or rotate the GCP admin-level credential that the xref:../operators/operator-reference.adoc#cloud-credential-operator_red-hat-operators[Cloud Credential Operator] uses in Mint mode. This option requires the presence of the admin-level credential during installation, but the credential is not stored in the cluster permanently and does not need to be long-lived.

=== Secure Boot support for installer-provisioned clusters

You can now deploy a cluster with Secure Boot when using installer-provisioned infrastructure on bare metal nodes. Deploying a cluster with Secure Boot requires UEFI boot mode and Red Fish Virtual Media. You cannot use self-generated keys with Secure Boot.

[id="ocp-4-7-nodes-autoscaling-ga"]
==== Autoscaling for memory utilization GA

Autoscaling for memory utilization is now generally available. You can create horizontal pod autoscaler custom resources to automatically scale the pods associated with a deployment config or replication controller to maintain the average memory utilization you specify, either a direct value or a percentage of requested memory. For more information, see xref:../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-autoscaling.html#nodes-pods-autoscaling-creating-memory_nodes-pods-autoscaling[Creating a horizontal pod autoscaler object for memory utilization].

[id="ocp-4-7-nodes-non-preempting-priority-classes"]
==== Non-preempting option for priority classes (Technology Preview)

You can now configure a priority class to be non-preempting by setting the `preemptionPolicy` field to `Never`. Pods with this priority class setting are placed in the scheduling queue ahead of lower priority pods, but do not preempt other pods.

For more information, see xref:../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-priority.html#non-preempting-priority-class_nodes-pods-priority[Non-preempting priority classes].

[id="ocp-4-7-known-issues"]
== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.7 and beyond!
* In {product-title} 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.
+
If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.1 to 4.7, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. It is recommended to revoke unauthenticated access unless there is a specific need for it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP `403` errors if you revoke unauthenticated access.
====
+
Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:
+
[source,bash]
----
## Snippet to remove unauthenticated group from all the cluster role bindings
$ for clusterrolebinding in cluster-status-binding discovery system:basic-user system:discovery system:openshift:discovery ;
do
### Find the index of unauthenticated group in list of subjects
index=$(oc get clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} -o json | jq 'select(.subjects!=null) | .subjects | map(.name=="system:unauthenticated") | index(true)');
### Remove the element at index from subjects array
oc patch clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} --type=json --patch "[{'op': 'remove','path': '/subjects/$index'}]";
done
----
+
This script removes unauthenticated subjects from the following cluster role bindings:
+
--
** `cluster-status-binding`
** `discovery`
** `system:basic-user`
** `system:discovery`
** `system:openshift:discovery`
