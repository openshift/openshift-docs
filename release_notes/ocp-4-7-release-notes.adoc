[id="ocp-4-7-about-this-release"]
== About this release

// TODO: Update k8s link once there is a version-specific URL for the Kubernetes release
(link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2020:1234[RHBA-2020:1234]) is now available. This release uses link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/[Kubernetes 1.20] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

//Red Hat did not publicly release {product-title} 4.6.0 as the GA version and, instead, is releasing {product-title} 4.6.1 as the GA version.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift. The {cloud-redhat-com} application for {product-title} allows you to deploy OpenShift clusters to either on-premise or cloud environments.

{product-title} {product-version} is supported on {op-system-base-full} 7.7 or later, as well as {op-system-first} 4.6.

You must use {op-system} machines for the control plane, which are also known as master machines, and you can use either {op-system} or {op-system-base-full} 7.7 or later for compute machines, which are also known as worker machines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because only {op-system-base-full} version 7.7 or later is supported for compute machines, you must not upgrade the {op-system-base} compute machines to version 8.
====

//{product-title} 4.6 is an Extended Update Support (EUS) release. More information on Red Hat OpenShift EUS is available in link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#ocp4_phases[OpenShift Life Cycle] and link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift-eus[OpenShift EUS Overview].

With the release of {product-title} 4.7, version 4.4 is now end of life. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy].

[id="ocp-4-7-new-features-and-enhancements"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

[id="ocp-4-7-rhcos"]
=== {op-system-first}

[id="ocp-4-7-enhanced-disk-provisioning"]
==== Enhanced disk provisioning for LUKS and RAID devices

{op-system} 4.7 includes several improvements to disk provisioning for bare metal deployments:

* Native Ignition support for LUKS disk encryption provides additional configurability for encrypted root filesystems, as well as support for encryption of additional data filesystems.
* {op-system} now supports boot disk mirroring, except on s390x, providing redundancy in the case of disk failure.
* {op-system} on s390x can be installed onto FBA DASD disks.

[NOTE]
====
LUKS configuration can no longer be performed in the `/etc/clevis.json` file. Provisioning fails if `/etc/clevis.json` is specified in the machine config.
====

[id="ocp-4-7-bootupd"]
==== Update the bootloader by using `bootupd`

With `bootupd`, {op-system} users now have access to a cross-distribution, system-agnostic OS update tool that manages firmware and boot updates in UEFI and legacy BIOS boot modes that run on modern architectures.

[id="ocp-4-7-rhcos-rhel-8-3-packages"]
==== {op-system} now supports RHEL 8.3

{op-system} is now using Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.3 packages. {product-title} 4.6 and below will stay with RHEL 8.2 packages. This enables you to have the latest fixes, features, and enhancements, such as NetworkManager features, as well as the latest hardware support and driver updates.

[id="ocp-4-7-rhcos-kdump"]
==== {op-system} now supports `kdump` service (Technical Preview)
The `kdump` service is introduced in Technical Preview in {op-system} to provide a crash-dumping mechanism for debugging kernel issues. You can use this service to save system memory content for later analysis. The `kdump` service is not managed at the cluster-level and must be enabled and configured manually on a per-node basis.

[id="ocp-4-7-ignition"]
==== Ignition updates
The following Ignition updates are now available:

* {op-system} now supports Ignition config spec 3.2.0. This update provides support for disk partition resizing, LUKS encrypted storage, and `gs://` URLs.
* When executing in non-default AWS partitions, such as GovCloud or AWS China, Ignition now fetches `s3://` resources from the same partition.
* Ignition now supports AWS EC2 Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2).

[id="ocp-4-7-installation-and-upgrade"]
=== Installation and upgrade

[id="ocp-4-7-aws-c2s-secret-region"]
==== Installing a cluster into the AWS C2S Secret Region

You can now install a cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) into the Commercial Cloud Services (C2S) Secret Region. Because the C2S region does not have an {op-system} AMI published by Red Hat, you must upload a custom AMI that belongs to that region. You are also required to include the CA certificates for C2S in the `additionalTrustBundle` field of the `install-config.yaml` file during cluster installation. Clusters deployed to the C2S Secret Region do not have access to the Internet; therefore, you must configure a private image registry.

The installation program does not support destroying a cluster deployed to the C2S region; you must manually remove the resources of the cluster.

//Link for more info when available.

[id="ocp-4-7-gcp-disk-encryption"]
==== Installing cluster on GCP with disk encryption using a personal encryption key

You can now install a cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and use a personal encryption key to encrypt both virtual machines and persistent volumes. This is done by setting the `controlPlane.platform.gcp.osDisk.encryptionKey`, `compute.platform.gcp.osDisk.encryptionKey`, or `gcp.defaultMachinePlatform.osDisk.encryptionKey` field in the `install-config.yaml` file.

//Link for more info when available.

[id="ocp-4-7-web-console"]
=== Web console

[id="ocp-4-7-web-console-localization"]
==== Web console localization

The web console is now localized and provides language support for global users. English, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, and Korean are currently supported. The displayed language follows your browser preferences, but you can also select a language to override the browser default. From the *Admin* drop-down menu, select *Language preferences* to update your language setting. Localized date and time is now also supported.

[id="ocp-4-7-web-console-insights-plugin"]
==== Insights plug-in

The xref:../support/remote_health_monitoring/using-insights-to-identify-issues-with-your-cluster.adoc#displaying-the-insights-status-in-the-web-console_using-insights-to-identify-issues-with-your-cluster[Insights plug-in] is now integrated into the {product-title} web console. Insights provides cluster health data, such as the number of total issues and total risks of the issues. Risks are labeled as *Critical*, *Important*, *Moderate*, or *Low*. You can quickly navigate to {cloud-redhat-com} for further details about the issues and how to fix them.

[id="ocp-4-7-security"]
=== Security and compliance

[id="ocp-4-7-cco-deletion-gcp-creds-mint-mode"]
==== Cloud Credential Operator support for deletion of GCP root credentials after installation

You can now remove or rotate the GCP admin-level credential that the xref:../operators/operator-reference.adoc#cloud-credential-operator_red-hat-operators[Cloud Credential Operator] uses in Mint mode. This option requires the presence of the admin-level credential during installation, but the credential is not stored in the cluster permanently and does not need to be long-lived.

=== Secure Boot support for installer-provisioned clusters

You can now deploy a cluster with Secure Boot when using installer-provisioned infrastructure on bare metal nodes. Deploying a cluster with Secure Boot requires UEFI boot mode and Red Fish Virtual Media. You cannot use self-generated keys with Secure Boot.

[id="ocp-4-7-networking"]
=== Networking

[id="ocp-4-7-ovn-kubernetes-egress-firewall-dns"]
==== OVN-Kubernetes egress firewall support for DNS rules

When configuring an egress firewall rule, you can now use a xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/configuring-egress-firewall-ovn.adoc#domain-name-server-resolution_configuring-egress-firewall-ovn[DNS domain name] instead of an IP address.
With the addition of DNS support in the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network provider egress firewall implementation, parity is achieved with the OpenShift SDN cluster network provider egress firewall implementation.

[id="ocp-4-7-storage"]
=== Storage

[id="ocp-4-7-storage-csi-snapshots"]
==== Persistent storage using CSI volume snapshots is generally availabile

You can use the Container Storage Interface (CSI) to create, restore, and delete a volume snapshot when using CSI drivers that provide support for volume snapshots. This feature was previously introduced as a Technology Preview feature in {product-title} 4.4 and is now generally available and enabled by default in {product-title} 4.7.

For more information, see xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-snapshots.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-snapshots[Using CSI volume snapshots].

[id="ocp-4-5-persistent-storage-csi-gcp-pd"]
==== Persistent storage using the GCP PD CSI Driver Operator (Technology Preview)

The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) persistent disk (PD) CSI driver is automatically deployed and managed on GCP environments, allowing you to dynamically provision these volumes without having to install the driver manually. The GCP PD CSI Driver Operator that manages this driver is in Technology Preview.

[id="ocp-4-5-persistent-storage-csi-cinder"]
==== Persistent storage using the OpenStack Cinder CSI Driver Operator (Technology Preview)

You can now use CSI to provision a persistent volume using the CSI driver for OpenStack Cinder.

// Add [OpenStack Cinder CSI Driver Operator] link if docs are added to Storage --> CSI for OCP 4.7:

[id="ocp-4-7-storage-vsphere-problem-detector"]
==== vSphere Problem Detector Operator

The vSphere Problem Detector Operator periodically checks functionality of {product-title} clusters installed in a vSphere environment. The vSphere Problem Detector Operator is installed by default by the Cluster Storage Operator, allowing you to quickly identify and troubleshoot common storage issues, such as configuration and permissions, on vSphere clusters.

[id="ocp-4-7-registry"]
=== Registry

[id="ocp-4-7-registry-oci-support"]
==== Open Container Initiative images support

The {product-title} internal registry and image streams now support Open Container Initiative (OCI) images. You can use OCI images in the same way you would use Docker `schema2` images.

//Add link

[id="ocp-4-7-machine-api"]
=== Machine API

[id="ocp-4-7-machine-api-wait-upgrade"]
==== Updates are immediately blocked if a machine config pool is degraded

If a machine config pool (MCP) is in a `degraded` state, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) now reports its *Upgradeable* status as *False*. As a result, you are now prevented from performing an update within a minor version, for example, from 4.7 to 4.8, until all machine config pools are healthy. Previously, with a degraded machine config pool, the Machine Config Operator did not report its *Upgradeable* status as *false*. The update was allowed and would eventually fail when updating the Machine Config Operator because of the degraded machine config pool. There is no change in this behavior for updates within z-stream releases, for example, from 4.7.1 to 4.7.2. As such, you should check the machine config pool status before performing a z-stream update.

[id="ocp-4-7-nodes"]
=== Nodes

[id="ocp-4-7-nodes-descheduler-ga"]
==== Descheduler and profiles GA

The descheduler is now generally available. The descheduler provides the ability to evict a running pod so that the pod can be rescheduled onto a more suitable node. You can enable one or more of the following descheduler profiles:

* `AffinityAndTaints`: evicts pods that violate basic pod and node affinity and node taints.
* `TopologyAndDuplicates`: evicts pods in an effort to evenly spread similar pods, or pods of the same topology domain, among nodes.
* `LifecycleAndUtilization`: evicts long-running pods and balances resource usage between nodes.

For more information, see xref:../nodes/scheduling/nodes-descheduler.adoc#nodes-descheduler[Evicting pods using the descheduler].

[id="ocp-4-7-nodes-autoscaling-ga"]
==== Autoscaling for memory utilization GA

Autoscaling for memory utilization is now generally available. You can create horizontal pod autoscaler custom resources to automatically scale the pods associated with a deployment config or replication controller to maintain the average memory utilization you specify, either a direct value or a percentage of requested memory. For more information, see xref:../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-autoscaling.html#nodes-pods-autoscaling-creating-memory_nodes-pods-autoscaling[Creating a horizontal pod autoscaler object for memory utilization].

[id="ocp-4-7-nodes-non-preempting-priority-classes"]
==== Non-preempting option for priority classes (Technology Preview)

You can now configure a priority class to be non-preempting by setting the `preemptionPolicy` field to `Never`. Pods with this priority class setting are placed in the scheduling queue ahead of lower priority pods, but do not preempt other pods.

For more information, see xref:../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-priority.html#non-preempting-priority-class_nodes-pods-priority[Non-preempting priority classes].

[id="ocp-4-7-known-issues"]
== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.7 and beyond!
* In {product-title} 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.
+
If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.1 to 4.7, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. It is recommended to revoke unauthenticated access unless there is a specific need for it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP `403` errors if you revoke unauthenticated access.
====
+
Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:
+
[source,bash]
----
## Snippet to remove unauthenticated group from all the cluster role bindings
$ for clusterrolebinding in cluster-status-binding discovery system:basic-user system:discovery system:openshift:discovery ;
do
### Find the index of unauthenticated group in list of subjects
index=$(oc get clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} -o json | jq 'select(.subjects!=null) | .subjects | map(.name=="system:unauthenticated") | index(true)');
### Remove the element at index from subjects array
oc patch clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} --type=json --patch "[{'op': 'remove','path': '/subjects/$index'}]";
done
----
+
This script removes unauthenticated subjects from the following cluster role bindings:
+
--
** `cluster-status-binding`
** `discovery`
** `system:basic-user`
** `system:discovery`
** `system:openshift:discovery`
