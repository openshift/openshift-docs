Release notes contain information about new and deprecated features, breaking changes, fixed issues, and known issues. The following release notes apply to the most recent OpenShift {gitops-shortname} releases on {OCP}.

{gitops-title} is a declarative way to implement continuous deployment for cloud native applications. {gitops-title} ensures consistency in applications when you deploy them to different clusters in different environments, such as development, staging, and production. {gitops-title} helps you automate the following tasks:

* Ensure that the clusters have similar states for configuration, monitoring, and storage.
* Recover or recreate clusters from a known state.
* Apply or revert configuration changes to multiple {OCP} clusters.
* Associate templated configuration with different environments.
* Promote applications across clusters, from staging to production.
