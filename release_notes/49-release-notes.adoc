[id="new-features_{context}"]
== New features

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts:

//Platform
//ROX-27051
[id="scan-vms-support_{context}"]
=== Support for scanning virtual machines on Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization (Developer Preview)

This release adds support to {product-title-short} for vulnerability management of virtual machine (VM) workloads at runtime on {ocp-virt-first}. The feature requires you to run a virtual machine agent to perform continuous package scanning from inside of the virtual machine.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This is a Developer Preview feature introduced in {product-title-short} 4.9 that is currently under active development. It is released with the intent of testing, feedback, and early evaluation only and is not supported for production environments.
====

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7133102[Vulnerability management for virtual machines with {product-title}].

//Policy

//ROX-27883
[id="admission-controller-changes_{context}"]
=== Admission controller configuration enhancements

{product-title-short} 4.9 provides new and simplified configuration options available during secured cluster installation for all installation methods. You can use these options to perform the following actions:

* Configure the failure policy on its validating webhooks
* Configure enforcement of the security policies that have enforcement enabled

In addition, several older configuration options have been deprecated for simplicity and correctness. For more information about deprecated items, see xref:../release_notes/49-release-notes.adoc#deprecated-and-removed-features_release-notes-49[Deprecated and removed features].

You can view the new settings in the {product-title-short} portal in the *Platform Configuration* -> *Clusters* page for each cluster. You can configure these settings by using the following methods:

* For clusters installed by using the Operator, configure these settings in the `SecuredCluster` CR:
** `spec.admissionControl.failurePolicy`: Determines the action that the cluster should take when an error or timeout happens with the admission controller. If the timeout seconds have been reached and the failure policy is `Ignore`, the API server "fails open" or accepts the create or update request. If the timeout seconds have been reached and the failure policy is set to `Fail`, the API server rejects the create or update request.
** `spec.admissionControl.enforcement`: Determines if the admission controller has been configured to enforce policies that have enforcement enabled. This field defaults to `Enabled` for new installations.
* For clusters installed by using Helm, configure these settings in the Helm `values.yaml` file:
** `admissionControl.failurePolicy`: Determines the action that the cluster should take when an error or timeout happens with the admission controller. If the timeout seconds have been reached and the failure policy is `Ignore`, the API server "fails open" or accepts the create or update request. If the timeout seconds have been reached and the failure policy is `Fail`, the API server rejects the create or update request. 
** `admissionControl.enforce`: Determines if the admission controller has been configured to enforce policies that have enforcement enabled. This field defaults to `true` for new installations.

For more information, see the following documentation:

* xref:../operating/manage_security_policies/use-admission-controller-enforcement.adoc#use-admission-controller-enforcement[Using admission controller enforcement]
* xref:../installing/installing_ocp/install-secured-cluster-config-options-ocp.adoc#admission-controller-settings_install-secured-cluster-config-options-ocp[Admission controller settings] (Operator)
* xref:../installing/installing_ocp/install-secured-cluster-ocp.adoc#secured-cluster-services-config_install-secured-cluster-ocp[Configuration parameters] (Helm)
* xref:..//cloud_service/installing_cloud_ocp/install-secured-cluster-cloud-ocp.adoc#secured-cluster-services-config_install-secured-cluster-cloud-ocp[Configuration parameters] (Helm for {product-title-managed-short})
* xref:../cli/command-reference/roxctl-sensor.adoc#roxctl-sensor[roxctl sensor command]

//ROX-29160
[id="redhat-images-signed-release-key_{context}"]
=== New default system policy for Red Hat image signing

A new default policy, "Red Hat images must be signed by a Red Hat release key", is available with this release. This policy ensures that Red Hat images are signed by the Red Hat link:https://access.redhat.com/security/team/key[Release Key 3 product signing key]. In addition to ensuring supply chain provenance, this default policy serves as an example of using the "Image Signature" field and combining it with other criteria.

For more information, see xref:../operating/manage_security_policies/security-policy-reference.adoc#high-sev-security-policies_security-policy-reference[High severity security policies].

//ROX-26282
[id="automatic-baseline-locking_{context}"]
=== Ability to automatically lock baselines to improve process execution policy

This process execution policy improvement automates the process of locking baselines, removing the need to complete this process manually for each deployment. The change is designed to significantly reduce the time and effort to complete this process and to enable security teams to focus on more critical work items.

Furthermore, this change allows for a more proactive security approach. Instead of waiting for a deployment to exist before setting up an alert, you can define a policy for a specific scope, such as a namespace. Any new deployment in that scope will automatically raise alerts, ensuring consistent security across all deployments.

For more information, see xref:../operating/evaluate-security-risks.adoc#auto-lock-process-baselines_evaluate-security-risks[Configuring auto-lock for process baselines].

//ROX-26289
[id="vuln-reporting-enhancements_{context}"]
=== Vulnerability reporting enhancements

With this release, you can directly export CSV files from the vulnerability management pages, potentially enhancing your vulnerability management workflows. This feature also empowers you to use granular filters and create on-demand, view-based reports and provides flexibility in analyzing data and addressing specific security concerns.

Additionally, you can generate view-based reports directly from both individual image and deployment detail pages.

For more information about creating and downloading vulnerability reports, see xref:../operating/manage-vulnerabilities/vulnerability-reporting.adoc#vulnerability-reporting[Vulnerability reporting].

//ROX-28029
[id="scannerv4-sbom-delegated-scans_{context}"]
=== SBOM creation is generally available and supports delegated scanning

With this release, using {product-title-short} to generate a software bill of materials (SBOM) from scanned container images is generally available (GA). SBOM generation includes images scanned with the {product-title-short} delegated scanning feature. These SBOMs provide a detailed overview of all software components, dependencies, and libraries within an application. The SBOMs created by {product-title-short} are of the link:https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/sbom-types-document-508c.pdf["Analyzed"] type and conform to the SPDX 2.3 specification.

For more information, see xref:../operating/manage-vulnerabilities/scanner-generate-sbom.adoc#scanner-generate-sbom[Generating SBOMs from scanned images].

//External integrations

//ROX-22434
[id="servicenow-vm-integration_{context}"]
=== Integration with the ServiceNow Container Vulnerability Response Application is generally available

{product-title-short} integration with the ServiceNow Container Vulnerability Response Application is now GA in the link:https://store.servicenow.com/store/app/edea7344476072502ec7c1c4f16d4343#summary[ServiceNow Marketplace]. {product-title-short} integration with ServiceNow populates rich container image vulnerability data from {product-title-short} in the ServiceNow Container Vulnerability Response Module. It enables {product-title-short} users to create custom vulnerability management workflows for efficient tracking and remediation of vulnerabilities.

//ROX-30087
[id="m2m-token-exchange-jwt"]
=== Support for machine-to-machine token exchange for external JSON web token issuers

With this update, {product-title-short} supports transparent machine-to-machine (M2M) token exchange with external JSON web token (JWT) token issuers. {product-title-short} performs a token exchange between third-party identity tokens and {product-title-short}. It uses role mapping to allow access to the {product-title-short} API. This improvement enables third-party clients that do not support the full M2M token exchange flow to access the {product-title-short} API endpoint. For example, a Prometheus server does not support M2 token exchange, but can use Kubernetes service account tokens to access the API endpoint.

For more information, see xref:../configuration/configure-api-token.adoc#configure-api-token[Configuring API tokens].

//ROX-29959, ROX-29070
[id="declarative-config-m2m_{context}"]
=== Declarative configuration for machine-to-machine access configuration

With this release, you can declaratively configure M2M OIDC authentication. To configure M2M authentication resources, you first create YAML files that contain configuration information. These files are used to create a config map or secret. During installation of the {product-title-short} Central resource, the config map or secret is added to Central by using a mount point.

For an example of setting up declarative configuration for short-lived OIDC token usage, see xref:../configuration/declarative-configuration-using.adoc#declarative-config-example-short-lived-token[Declarative configuration short-lived token example].

//Security

//ROX-20262
[id="certificate-rotation-operator-managed-clusters_{context}"]
=== Automatic certificate authority rotation for Operator-managed clusters

Previously, in release 4.7, {product-title-short} automatically rotated only the 1-year service certificates. This change enables automatic rotation for the 5-year CA certificates also. The change is designed to simplify the management of large cluster installations, where the manual upgrading of certificates can require significant effort.

[NOTE]
====
Automatic certificate rotation remains partially supported for Helm-installed secured clusters. These clusters can connect to Central with the rotated CA but their certificates remain signed by the older CA.
====

For more information, see xref:../configuration/reissue-internal-certificates.adoc#reissue-internal-certificates[Reissuing internal certificates].

//ROX-27238
[id="crs-expiration-time_{context}"]
=== Configurable expiration time for cluster registration secrets

With this release, the expiration time for cluster registration secrets (CRSes) is changed from a default value of 1 year to a default value of 1 hour. Additionally, you can configure the time period by using the `--valid-until` or `--valid-for` flags with the `roxctl central crs` command. 

For more information, see xref:../cli/command-reference/roxctl-central.adoc#roxctl-central-crs_roxctl-central[roxctl central crs command].


//ROX-30654
[id="smtp-ehlo-helo-hostname_{context}"]
=== SMTP EHLO/HELO hostname field supported in the {product-title-short} email notifier

With the 4.9 release, {product-title-short} SMTP notifiers support configuring the EHLO/HELO hostname. This capability allows for better compatibility with strict mail relay servers in secured environments.

For more information, see xref:../integration/integrate-with-email.adoc#integrate-with-email[Integrating with email].

//Monitoring

//ROX-28326
[id="prometheus-custom-metrics_{context}"]
=== {product-title-short} supports detailed security metrics

With the 4.9 release, {product-title-short} Central exposes detailed security metrics on its `/metrics` API endpoint, allowing users to scrape this data by using an existing Prometheus infrastructure.
With this feature, you can leverage deep, customizable security observability for proactive alerting and trend analysis.

For more information, see xref:../configuration/monitor-acs.adoc#custom-prometheus-metrics_monitor-acs[Using custom Prometheus metrics].

//Performance

//ROX-28634
[id="vuln-defs-offline-improvement_{context}"]
=== Improved resource handling for offline vulnerability bundles

{product-title-short} has improved Central's handling of offline vulnerability bundles, resulting in less pressure on Central DB and Central disk, especially in larger environments.

//ROX-29060
[id="sensor-memory-usage-improvements_{context}"]
=== Optimized Sensor memory usage to improve performance

With this release, Sensor uses significantly less memory than earlier releases in clusters with large numbers of processes that listen for connections. In extreme-scale environments, for example, clusters with greater than 10 million open ports, Sensor's memory footprint related to open connections, endpoints, and process tracking is reduced by roughly 50%. This improvement helps prevent out-of-memory (OOM) kills. For moderate workloads, such as a few thousand open ports, memory savings typically range between 10 to 15%, depending on workload characteristics. 

This optimization was achieved by changing how the Sensor tracks and reports updates to Central. Previously, Sensor retained full details of all open connections, endpoints, and processes while they remained active. Sensor also consumed memory required to store all of these details. With this change, Sensor stores only a fingerprint, or hash, of each object, greatly reducing memory usage.

[id="notable-technical-changes_{context}"]
== Notable technical changes

This release contains the following changes:

//ROX-24620
[id="image-technology-change"]
=== Product image build and release technology change

If you are updating from an {product-title-short} release earlier than 4.6.10, 4.7.7, or 4.8.3, you might notice changes to container image metadata, such as container labels or SBOM contents and location. This change is because product images are now built and released by using different technologies. These changes do not affect product functionality, but they might impact your third-party integrations.

//ROX-29723
[id="policy-editor-enhancements-updates_{context}"]
=== Enhancements and updates to policy editor fields

The policy editor in the {product-title-short} portal was enhanced and includes rearranged and renamed policy criteria to better reflect their intended use in policy lifecycle stages. The policy lifecycle selection process was simplified and the introductory text was updated to assist you in authoring policies. The following changes were included:

* Policy criteria categories were grouped under top-level headings that reflect how the criteria trigger policy violations.
* Criteria related to image scan results were moved out of the *Image contents* category into a new category, *Image scanning*.
* A new category, *Baseline deviation*, was created and the *Unexpected network flow* and *Unexpected process execution* criteria were moved into it.
* Runtime audit log policy criteria were split into *Resource operations* and *Resource attributes*.

For more information, see xref:../operating/manage_security_policies/custom-security-policies.adoc#custom-security-policies[Creating and modifying security policies].

//Compliance

//ROX-29793
[id="compliance-access-rights_{context}"]
=== Permission updates for Compliance menus and API endpoints

With this release, accessing the following items requires `read` permissions for the cluster resource:

* Compliance menus: 
** *OpenShift Coverage*
** *OpenShift Schedules*
* API endpoints:
** `/v2/compliance/*`

For more information, see xref:../operating/manage-compliance/compliance-feature-overview.adoc#openshift-infrastructure-compliance_compliance-feature-overview[OpenShift infrastructure compliance].

//ROX-28412 & ROX-25970
[id="policy-documentation-updates_{context}"]
=== Policy documentation enhancements and updates

Policy documentation was restructured, simplified, and enhanced. Comprehensive information was added to provide an overview of policy evaluation, structure, and enforcement. Reference information was split out into a separate section. Additionally, documentation errors were corrected. 

For more information, see the following documentation:

* xref:../operating/manage_security_policies/about-security-policies.adoc#about-security-policies[About policies in {product-title-short}]
* xref:../operating/manage_security_policies/security-policy-reference.adoc#security-policy-reference[Security policy reference]

. API token authentication is deprecated. The corresponding cloud source integration uses service accounts for authentication.

. The *Export Download Evidence as CSV* functionality was removed from the image, node, and platform CVE pages due to technical issues. This functionality is provided by new reporting features. For more information about creating and downloading vulnerability reports, see xref:../operating/manage-vulnerabilities/vulnerability-reporting.adoc#vulnerability-reporting[Vulnerability reporting].

. The current hierarchical implementation for defining Collections is deprecated and is anticipated to be replaced by a more comprehensive search-based definition in a future release.

. The Google Container Registry integration is deprecated in response to the deprecation of Container Registry. You can use the Artifact Registry as a registry replacement and Scanner V4 as a scanner replacement.
+
For more information, see link:https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/transition/transition-from-gcr[Transition from Container Registry] (Google Cloud documentation).

. Kernel support packages and driver download functionality are deprecated.

. All GraphQL endpoints are deprecated and are expected to be removed in a future release. The endpoints were created to support the {product-title-short} portal. All other uses are unsupported. 

. The deprecated and unsupported GraphQL query of image -> scan -> components and image -> scan -> components -> vulns has been eliminated in favor of image -> scan -> imageComponents and image -> scan -> imageComponents -> imageVulnerabilities.

. The manifest installation method is deprecated and is expected to be removed in the future. Manifest installation is currently done by using the `roxctl {central,sensor,scanner} generate` command in the CLI, or by choosing the legacy installation method in the {product-title-short} portal. Use the Operator or Helm installation methods.

. A feature flag controls this API object, and you can enable or disable this API object by using the `ROX_VULN_MGMT_LEGACY_SNOOZE` environment variable.

. The format for specifying duration in JSON requests to `v1/nodecves/suppress`, `v1/clustercves/suppress`, and `v1/imagecves/suppress` has been changed to the ProtoJSON format.
Only a numeric value representing seconds with optional fractional seconds for nanosecond precision and followed by the `s` suffix is supported.
+
For example, `0.300s`, `-5400s`, or `9900s`. The previously valid time units of `ns`, `us`, `µs`, `ms`, `m`, and `h` are no longer supported.

. The *Vulnerability Management* -> *Dashboard* view is deprecated and is planned to be removed in a future release. You can use the *User workload vulnerabilities*, *Exception management*, *Platform vulnerabilities*, and *Node CVEs* views as alternatives.

[id="bug-fixes_{context}"]
== Bug fixes in version 4.9.0

*Release date*: {ga-date-490}

//ROX-13221
* Fixed a bug in the policy editor in the {product-title-short} portal that causes environment variables criteria or Dockerfile criteria with a keyword of `ENV` to be malformed when the criteria value includes the `=` character.
* With this release, when `allowPrivilegeEscalation` is not defined in a containers security context, {product-title-short} assumes the value is `true`. As part of good security practices, this value would usually be explicitly set to `false` to provide better security and ensure that the container cannot access a parent process with higher privileges. Policies with that criteria also create violations on deployments with containers that do not have the `allowPrivilegeEscalation` field defined in their security context.
//ROX-29776
* Before this update, the response times were slow because the `serviceaccounts` endpoint improperly handled pagination parameters and returned all service accounts. With this release, you can use the `serviceaccounts` endpoint, which considers pagination limits and therefore returns only the specified number of service accounts.
//ROX-30498
* Before this update, you might have experienced a consistently growing Central database that caused constant resizing of the persistent volume claim (PVC) or service interruptions from a no space left on device error. With this release, if the hashes table is the source of the growth, you can turn off the feature by setting ROX_HASH_FLUSH_INTERVAL=0.
//ROX-29755
* Before this update, Sensor's failure to call `stream.Recv()` caused gRPC flow control to block image reprocessing every 4 hours. This update resolves the issue by including a timeout for sending messages to Sensors in the reprocessing loop, allowing image reprocessing to resume as expected.
//ROX-23996
* With this update, we have streamlined our Central startup process, making the API endpoint available sooner.
//ROX-31049
* The {product-title-short} 4.7.7, 4.8.3, and 4.8.4 releases set `mediaType` on container images to `oci` which is not compatible with some older registries and could break image mirroring. In this release, the `mediaType` is reverted to `docker` so that {product-title-short} product images can be mirrored in older image registries not supporting the `oci` mediaType.
//ROX-31158
* With this release, the gRPC framework better propagates server name information to the processing of requests. This ensures benefits that include the generation of a correct redirect URI for the {ocp} authentication backend, and as a consequence, a working {ocp} authentication flow.
//ROX-21764
* The matching logic for the process arguments criterion in security policies is fixed to do a "contains" match for the supplied values, instead of a whole string match. 
//ROX-30949
* Before this update, diagnostic bundles included telemetry gathering information from all clusters without respecting the cluster filter. As a consequence, users experienced slow diagnostic bundle creation for large fleet clusters. With this release, diagnostic bundle generation respects cluster filters and diagnostic bundle generation for large fleets is faster.
//ROX-19315
* Fixed a bug that caused secured clusters to get stuck in a pending, or locked, state when an API referenced by Helm was removed from the cluster.
//ROX-31192
* Fixed a bug where searching on an unknown label caused Central to crash.
//ROX-31365
* Fixed an issue that could cause database connection exhaustion when many sensors try to reconnect at the same time.
//ROX-29795, ROX-28952, //ROX-29772
* Various bugs for Compliance Operator were fixed and improvements were made, including the following items:
** Profiles are better mapped to specific *Coverage* tabs, for example, *OCP4-CIS* is displayed under the *CIS* tab. 
//ROX-30821
** BSI profiles now display in their own tab, instead of in the *Other* tab in the *Coverage* page.
** Scans can be scheduled for node profiles of different products.
** Sensor retries and waits longer for Compliance Operator and related Kubernetes resource creation.
