[[ocp-310-about-this-release]]
== About This Release

Red Hat {product-title} version 3.10
(link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018:1816[RHBA-2018:1816]) is now
available. This release is based on
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/tag/v3.10.0-rc.0[OKD 3.10] and it uses Kubernetes 1.10. New features, changes, bug fixes, and
known issues that pertain to {product-title} 3.10 are included in this topic.

{product-title} 3.10 is supported on RHEL 7.4 and 7.5 with the latest packages
from Extras, including Docker 1.13. It is also supported on Atomic Host 7.4.5
and newer. The *docker-latest* package is now deprecated.

TLSV1.2 is the only supported security version in {product-title} version 3.4
and later. You must update if you are using TLSV1.0 or TLSV1.1.

For initial installations, see the
xref:../install/index.adoc#install-planning[Installing Clusters] documentation.

To upgrade to this release from a previous version, see the
xref:../upgrading/index.adoc#install-config-upgrading-index[Upgrading Clusters]
documentation.

[[ocp-310-new-features-and-enhancements]]
== New Features and Enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

[[ocp-310-installation]]
=== Installation

[[ocp-310-important-installation-changes]]
==== Important Changes

A number of important changes have been made to the installation process in
{product-title} 3.10.

* The control plane components (etcd, API server, and controllers) are now
xref:ocp-310-system-services-now-hosted-on-pods[run as static pods] by the
kubelet on the masters. This is now the only supported way they can be run. The
upgrade will change over to this automatically. You can see the pods once the
control plane comes up with `oc get pods -n kube-system` and execute, log, and
inspect them using normal `oc` CLI commands.

* The containerized mode (starting containers directly from docker) for
{product-title} is no longer supported.

* openshift-sdn and openvswitch will be run in a daemonset.

* The *_/etc/sysconfig/(origin|atomic-openshift)-(api|controllers)_* files will no
longer be used. A new *_/etc/origin/master/master.env_* file can be used to set
environment variables for the static pods. The set of configurations available as
environment variables are limited. Future versions of
{product-title} will remove this configuration in favor of control plane files,
so consider the *_master.env_* file a last resort and deprecated. To bridge the
gap for host-level debugging of static pods, a set of shims are installed to
*_/usr/local/bin_*:
+
** *_/usr/local/bin/master-restart (etcd|api|controllers)_*
*** This causes the kubelet to restart the entire static pod for the named
component.
*** This is _not_ a blocking operation and is deliberately limited to prevent
complex scripting.
*** You can also trigger a restart by performing:
+
----
$ oc annotate -n kube-system POD_NAME gen=N --overwrite
----
+
** *_/usr/local/bin/master-logs (etcd etcd|api api|controllers controllers)_*
*** Print the most recent container logs for the given component (the component name
and container name match).
*** Extra options are passed to the container runtime.
*** use `oc logs -n kube-system POD_NAME` instead.
** *_/usr/local/bin/master-exec (etcd etcd|api api|controllers controllers)_*
*** Execute a command inside the container to support the backup of etcd. Use these sparingly.

See xref:ocp-310-containerized-installation-removed[Containerized Installation
Method Support Changes] and xref:ocp-310-control-plane-changes[Control Plane as Static
Pods] for more information.

*Debugging Tips*

Use `oc get nodes` to see if nodes are ready. If a node is not ready, it is
usually:

* Waiting for certificate approval. Run `oc get csr` to see all certificates being
requested. Run `oc get csr -o name | xargs oc adm certificate approve` to
approve all certificates.  When you approve certificates, it can take a few
seconds for the node to report that it is ready again.

* The SDN pod is not running on the node.  You should usually be able to delete the
SDN or OVS pods on a given node to trigger a reset and processes should
continue.

* If your API or controller container is not running (`docker ps | grep api`) use
`master-logs api` to see why. Typically, the cause is a failed configuration.

* There is one known Kubelet wedge state that will be fixed in the 1.10 rebase
where the Kubelet will display messages like *system:anonymous cannot access
resource foo*. This means that the certificates expired before the kubelet
could refresh them. If restarting the kubelet does not fix the issue, delete the
contents of *_/etc/origin/node/certificates/_*, and then restart the kubelet.

* If you see any component that does not converge, meaning that it stays in a
crashlooping state, open a bug with any logs from that pod. This is most
commonly an openshift-sdn / OVS issue where the networking in the container is
lost, but the kubelet or SDN does not realize it.

[[ocp-310-atomic-host-deprecated]]
===  Atomic Host Deprecation

Atomic Host is now deprecated. Atomic Host will continue to be supported in
{product-title} 3.11 and will be removed in {product-title} 4.0.

[[ocp-310-openshift-automation-broker]]
=== OpenShift Automation Broker

[[ocp-310-oab-uses-crds]]
==== The OpenShift Automation Broker Now Uses CRDs Instead of Local etcd

The OpenShift Automation Broker will now use custom resource definitions (CRDs)
instead of a local etcd instance.

There is now a migration path from etcd to CRD for `openshift-ansible`

[[ocp-310-mediawiki-apb-updated]]
==== mediawiki-abp Examples Updated

Examples of *mediawiki-apb* Ansible playbook bundles (APB) are updated to use
version 1.27.

[[ocp-310-storage]]
=== Storage

[[ocp-310-pv-provisioning-using-openstack-manilla]]
==== Persistent Volume (PV) Provisioning Using OpenStack Manila (Technology Preview)

Persistent volume (PV) provisioning using OpenStack Manila is currently in
xref:ocp-310-technology-preview[Technology Preview] and not for production
workloads.

{product-title} is capable of provisioning PVs using the
link:https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Manila[OpenStack Manila] shared file system
service.

See
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_manila.adoc#persistent_storage_manila[Persistent
Storage Using OpenStack Manila] for more information.

[[ocp-310-pv-resize]]
==== PV Resize (Technology Preview)

Persistent volume (PV) resize is currently in
xref:ocp-310-technology-preview[Technology Preview] and not for production
workloads.

You can expand persistent volume claims online from {product-title} for glusterFS.

. Create a storage class with `allowVolumeExpansion=true`.
. The PVC uses the storage class and submits a claim.
. The PVC specifies a new increased size.
. The underlying PV is resized.

See
xref:../dev_guide/expanding_persistent_volumes.adoc#expanding_persistent_volumes[Expanding
Persistent Volumes] for more information.

[[ocp-310-CSI]]
==== Container Storage Interface (Technology Preview)

Container Storage Interface (CSI) is currently in
xref:ocp-310-technology-preview[Technology Preview] and not for production
workloads.

CSI allows {product-title} to consume storage from storage backends that
implement the link:https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec[CSI
interface] as
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent
storage].

See
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_csi.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-csi[Persistent
Storage Using Container Storage Interface (CSI)] for more information.

[[ocp-310-local-ephemeral-storage]]
==== Protection of Local Ephemeral Storage (Technology Preview)

Protection of Local Ephemeral Storage is currently in
xref:ocp-310-technology-preview[Technology Preview] and not for production
workloads.

You can now control the use of the local ephemeral storage feature on your nodes
in order to prevent users from exhausting node local storage with their pods and
other pods that happen to be on the same node.

This feature is disabled by default. If enabled, the {product-title} cluster uses
ephemeral storage to store information that does not need to persist after the
cluster is destroyed.

See xref:../install_config/configuring_ephemeral.adoc#install-config-configuring-ephemeral-storage[Configuring Ephemeral Storage] for more information.

[[ocp-310-tenant-driven-storage-snapshotting]]
==== Tenant-driven Storage Snapshotting (Technology Preview)

Tenant-driven storage snapshotting is currently in
xref:ocp-310-technology-preview[Technology Preview] and not for production
workloads.

Tenants now have the ability to leverage the underlying storage technology
backing the persistent volume (PV) assigned to them to make a snapshot of their
application data. Tenants can also now restore a given snapshot from the past to
their current application.

An external provisioner is used to access the EBS, GCE pDisk, and HostPath. This
Technology Preview feature has tested EBS and HostPath. The tenant must stop the
pods and start them manually.

. The administrator runs an external provisioner for the cluster. These are images
from the Red Hat Container Catalog.

. The tenant made a PVC and owns a PV from one of the supported storage
solutions.The administrator must create a new `StorageClass` in the cluster with:
+
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: snapshot-promoter
provisioner: volumesnapshot.external-storage.k8s.io/snapshot-promoter
----

. The tenant can create a snapshot of a PVC named `gce-pvc` and the resulting
snapshot will be called `snapshot-demo`.
+
----
$ oc create -f snapshot.yaml

apiVersion: volumesnapshot.external-storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshot
metadata:
  name: snapshot-demo
  namespace: myns
spec:
  persistentVolumeClaimName: gce-pvc
----

. Now, they can restore their pod to that snapshot.
+
----
$ oc create -f restore.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: snapshot-pv-provisioning-demo
  annotations:
    snapshot.alpha.kubernetes.io/snapshot: snapshot-demo
spec:
  storageClassName: snapshot-promoter
----

[[ocp-310-scale]]
=== Scale

[[ocp-310-scale-cluster-limits]]
==== Cluster Limits

Updated guidance around
xref:../scaling_performance/cluster_limits.adoc#scaling-performance-cluster-limits[Cluster
Limits] for {product-title} 3.10 is now available.

[[ocp-310-device-plugins]]
==== Device Plug-ins

Device Plug-ins are now moved out of Technology Preview and generally available
in {product-title} 3.10. {product-title} supports the device plug-in API, but the
device plug-in containers are supported by individual vendors.

Device plug-ins allow you to use a particular device type (GPU, InfiniBand,
or other similar computing resources that require vendor-specific initialization
and setup) in your {product-title} pod without needing to write custom code. The
device plug-in provides a consistent and portable solution to consume hardware
devices across clusters. The device plug-in provides support for these devices
through an extension mechanism, which makes these devices available to
containers, provides health checks of these devices, and securely shares them.

A device plug-in is a gRPC service running on the nodes (external to
`atomic-openshift-node.service`) that is responsible for managing specific
hardware resources.

See the  xref:../dev_guide/device_plugins.adoc#using-device-plugins[Developer
Guide] for further conceptual information about Device Plug-ins.

[[ocp-310-CPU-manager]]
==== CPU Manager

CPU Manager is now moved out of Technology Preview and generally available in
{product-title} 3.10.

CPU Manager manages groups of CPUs and constrains workloads to specific CPUs.

CPU Manager is useful for workloads that have some of these attributes:

* Require as much CPU time as possible.
* Are sensitive to processor cache misses.
* Are low-latency network applications.
* Coordinate with other processes and benefit from sharing a single processor
cache.

See
xref:../scaling_performance/using_cpu_manager.adoc#scaling-performance-using-cpu-manager[Using
CPU Manager] for more information.

[[ocp-310-device-manager]]
==== Device Manager

Device Manager is now moved out of Technology Preview and generally available in
{product-title} 3.10. {product-title} supports the device plug-in API, but the
device plug-in containers are supported by individual vendors.

Some users want to set resource limits for hardware devices within their pod
definition and have the scheduler find the node in the cluster with those
resources.  While at the same time, Kubernetes needed a way for hardware
vendors to advertise their resources to the kubelet without forcing them to
change core code within Kubernetes

The kubelet now houses a device manager that is extensible through plug-ins. You
load the driver support at the node level. Then, you or the vendor writes a
plug-in that listens for requests to stop/start/attach/assign the requested
hardware resources seen by the drivers. This plug-in is deployed to all the
nodes via a daemonSet.

See xref:../dev_guide/device_manager.adoc#using-device-manager[Using Device
Manager] for more information.

[[ocp-310-hugepages]]
==== Huge Pages

Huge pages are now moved out of Technology Preview and generally available in
{product-title} 3.10.

Memory is managed in blocks known as pages. On most systems, a page is 4Ki. 1Mi
of memory is equal to 256 pages; 1Gi of memory is 256,000 pages, and so on. CPUs
have a built-in memory management unit that manages a list of these pages in
hardware. The Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) is a small hardware cache of
virtual-to-physical page mappings. If the virtual address passed in a hardware
instruction can be found in the TLB, the mapping can be determined quickly. If
not, a TLB miss occurs, and the system falls back to slower, software-based
address translation, resulting in performance issues. Since the size of the
TLB is fixed, the only way to reduce the chance of a TLB miss is to increase the
page size.

A huge page is a memory page that is larger than 4Ki. On x86_64 architectures,
there are two common huge page sizes: 2Mi and 1Gi. Sizes vary on other
architectures. In order to use huge pages, code must be written so that
applications are aware of them. Transparent Huge Pages (THP) attempt to automate
the management of huge pages without application knowledge, but they have
limitations. In particular, they are limited to 2Mi page sizes. THP can lead to
performance degradation on nodes with high memory utilization or fragmentation
due to defragmenting efforts of THP, which can lock memory pages. For this
reason, some applications may be designed to use or recommend usage of
pre-allocated huge pages instead of THP.

In {product-title}, applications in a pod can allocate and consume pre-allocated
huge pages.

See xref:../scaling_performance/managing_hugepages.adoc#scaling-performance-managing-huge-pages[Managing
Huge Pages] for more information.

[[ocp-310-networking]]
=== Networking

[[ocp-310-route-annotation-limits-concurrent-connections]]
==== Route Annotation Limits Concurrent Connections

The route annotation `haproxy.router.openshift.io/pod-concurrent-connections`
limits concurrent connections.

See
xref:../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#route-specific-annotations[Route-specific
Annotations] for more information.

[[ocp-310-support-for-kubernetes-ingress-objects]]
==== Support for Kubernetes Ingress Objects

The Kubernetes ingress object is a configuration object determining how inbound
connections reach internal services. {product-title} has support for these
objects, starting in {product-title} 3.10, using a ingress controller
configuration file.

See
xref:../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#architecture-routes-support-for-ingress[Support
for Kubernetes ingress objects] for more information.

[[ocp-310-IP-failover-management-limited-to-254-groups]]
==== IP failover Management Limited to 254 Groups of VIP Addresses

IP failover management is limited to 254 groups of VIP addresses. By default,
{product-title} assigns one IP address to each group. You can use the
`virtual-ip-groups` option to change this so multiple IP addresses are in each
group and define the number of VIP groups available for each VRRP instance when
configuring IP failover.

See
xref:../admin_guide/high_availability.adoc#admin-guide-high-availability-configuring-more-than-254[High
Availability] for more information.

[[ocp-310-allow-dns-names-for-egress-routers]]
==== Allow DNS Names for Egress Routers

You can now set the egress router to refer to an external service, with a
potentially unstable IP address, by its host name.

See xref:../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#admin-guide-deploying-an-egress-dns-proxy-pod[Deploying an Egress Router DNS Proxy Pod]
for more information.

[[ocp-310-expand-servicenetwork]]
==== Expanding the serviceNetwork

You can now grow the service network address range in a multi-node environment
to a larger address space. This does not cover migration to a different range,
just the increase of an existing range.

See xref:../install_config/configuring_sdn.adoc#expanding-the-service-network[Expanding the Service Network]
for more information.

[[ocp-310-kuryr]]
==== Improved {product-title} and Red Hat OpenStack Integration with Kuryr (Technology Preview)

This feature  is currently in xref:ocp-310-technology-preview[Technology
Preview] and is not for production workloads.

See xref:../admin_guide/kuryr.adoc#admin-guide-kuryr[Kuryr SDN Administration]
and
xref:../install_config/configuring_kuryrsdn.adoc#install-config-configuring-kuryr-sdn[Configuring
Kuryr SDN] for best practices in {product-title} and Red Hat OpenStack
integration.

[[ocp-310-master]]
=== Master

[[ocp-310-the-descheduler]]
==== The Descheduler (Technology Preview)

The Descheduler is currently in xref:ocp-310-technology-preview[Technology
Preview] and is not for production workloads.

The descheduler moves pods from less desirable nodes to new nodes. Pods can be
moved for various reasons, such as:

* Some nodes are under- or over-utilized.
* The original scheduling decision does not hold true any more, as taints or
labels are added to or removed from nodes, pod/node affinity requirements are
not satisfied any more.
* Some nodes failed and their pods moved to other nodes.
* New nodes are added to clusters.

See
xref:../admin_guide/scheduling/descheduler.adoc#admin-guide-descheduler[Descheduling]
for more information.

[[ocp-310-node-problem-detector]]
==== Node Problem Detector (Technology Preview)

The Node Problem Detector is currently in xref:ocp-310-technology-preview[Technology
Preview] and is not for production workloads.

The Node Problem Detector monitors the health of your nodes by finding certain
problems and reporting these problems to the API server, where external
controllers could take action. The Node Problem Detector is a daemon that runs
on each node as a daemonSet.  The daemon tries to make the cluster aware of node
level faults that should make the node not schedulable. When you start the Node
Problem Detector, you tell it a port over which it should broadcast the issues
it finds. The detector allows you to load sub-daemons to do the data collection.
There are three as of today.  Issues found by the problem daemon can be
classified as `NodeCondition`.

Problem daemons:

* Kernel Monitor: Monitors kernel log via journald and reports problems according
to regex patterns.
* AbrtAdaptor: Monitors the node for kernel problems and application crashes from
journald.
* CustomerPluginMonitor: Allows you to test for any condition and exit on a `0` or
`1` should your condition not be met.

See
xref:../admin_guide/node_problem_detector.adoc#admin-guide-node-problem-detector[Node
Problem Detector] for more information.

[[ocp-310-system-services-now-hosted-on-pods]]
==== System Services Now Hosted on Pods
Each of the system services, API, controllers, and etcd, used to run as system
services on the master. These services now run on static pods in the cluster. As
a result, there are new commands to restart these services: `master-restart
api`, `master-restart controllers`, and `master-restart etcd`. To view log
information on these services, use `master-logs api api`, `master-logs
controllers controllers`, and `master-logs etcd etcd`.

See xref:ocp-310-important-installation-changes[Important Changes] for more information.

[[ocp-310-new-node-configuration-process]]
==== New Node Configuration Process
You can modify existing nodes through a configuration map rather than the
*_node-config.yaml_*. The installation creates three node configuration groups:
*node-config-master*, *node-config-infra*, and *node-config-compute* and creates
a configuration map for each group.  A sync pod watches for changes to these
configuration maps. When a change is detected, the sync pod updates the
*_node-config.yaml_* file on all of the nodes.

[[ocp-310-group-pruning]]
==== LDAP Group Pruning
To prune groups records from an external provider, administrators can
run the following command:

----
$ oc adm prune groups --sync-config=path/to/sync/config [<options>]
----

See xref:../admin_guide/pruning_resources.adoc#pruning-groups[Pruning groups] for more information.


[[ocp-310-podman]]
==== Podman (Technology Preview)

Podman is currently in xref:ocp-310-technology-preview[Technology Preview] and
is not for production workloads.

Podman is a daemon-less CLI/API for running, managing, and debugging OCI containers and pods. It:

* Is fast and lightweight.
* Leverages runC.
* Provides a syntax for working with containers.
* Has remote management API via Varlink.
* Provides systemd integration and advanced namespace isolation.

For more information, see link:https://blog.openshift.com/crictl-vs-podman/[Crictl Vs Podman].

[[ocp-310-metrics-and-logging]]
=== Metrics and Logging

[[ocp-310-prometheus]]
==== Prometheus (Technology Preview)

Prometheus remains in xref:ocp-310-technology-preview[Technology Preview] and is
not for production workloads. Prometheus, AlertManager, and AlertBuffer versions
are now updated and node-exporter is now included:

* prometheus 2.2.1
* Alertmanager 0.14.0
* AlertBuffer 0.2
* node_exporter 0.15.2

You can deploy Prometheus on an {product-title} cluster, collect Kubernetes and
infrastructure metrics, and get alerts. You can see and query metrics and alerts
on the Prometheus web dashboard. Alternatively, you can bring your own Grafana
and hook it up to Prometheus.

See xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#openshift-prometheus[Prometheus
on OpenShift] for more information.

[[ocp-310-syslog-output-plugin-for-fluentd]]
==== syslog Output Plug-in for fluentd (Technology Preview)

syslog Output Plug-in for fluentd is a feature currently in
xref:ocp-310-technology-preview[Technology Preview] and not for production
workloads.

You can send system and container logs from {product-title} nodes to external
endpoints using the syslog protocol. The fluentd syslog output plug-in supports
this.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Logs sent via syslog are not encrypted and, therefore, insecure.
====

See
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#sending-logs-to-external-rsyslog[Sending
Logs to an External Syslog Server] for more information.

[[ocp-310-developer-experience]]
=== Developer Experience

[[ocp-310-service-catalog-CLI]]
==== Service Catalog command-line interface (CLI)

The Service Catalog command-line interface (CLI) allows you to provision and
bind services from the command line. You can use a full set of commands to list,
describe, provision, deprovision, bind, and unbind.

The Service Catalog CLI utility called `svcat` is available for easier
interaction with Service Catalog resources. `svcat` communicates with the
Service Catalog API by using the aggregated API endpoint on an OpenShift
cluster.

See
xref:../architecture/service_catalog/service_catalog_cli.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-service-catalog-cli[Service
catalog command-line interface (CLI)] for more information.

[[ocp-310-new-ignore-volume-az-configuration-option]]
==== New ignore-volume-az Configuration Option

A new configuration option, `ignore-volume-az`, is now available  in the
*_cloud.conf_* file for Red Hat OpenStack. This is added to let {product-title}
not create labels with zones for persistent volumes. OpenStack Cinder and
OpenStack Nova can have different topology zones. {product-title} works
exclusively with Nova zones, ignoring Cinder topology. Therefore, it makes no
sense to set the label with a Cinder zone name into PVs, in case it is different
than Nova zones. A pod that uses such a PV would be unschedulable by
{product-title}. Cluster administrators can now turn off labeling of Cinder PVs
and make their pods schedulable.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1500776[*BZ#1500776*])

[[ocp-310-cli-plug-ins]]
==== CLI Plug-ins (Technology Preview)

CLI plug-ins are currently in xref:ocp-310-technology-preview[Technology Preview]
and not for production workloads.

Usually called _plug-ins_ or _binary extensions_, this feature allows you to
extend the default set of `oc` commands available and, therefore, allows you to
perform new tasks.

See xref:../cli_reference/extend_cli.adoc#cli-reference-extend-cli[Extending the
CLI] for information on how to install and write extensions for the CLI.

[[ocp-310-jenkins-updates]]
==== Jenkins Updates

There is now synchronized removal of build jobs, which allows for the cleanup of old, stale jobs.

Jenkins is now updated to 2.107.3-1.1 and Jenkins build agent (slave) images are now updated:

* Node.js 8
* Maven 3.5

The following images are deprecated in {product-title} 3.10:
----
jenkins-slave-maven-*
jenkins-slave-nodejs-*
----

The images still exist in the interim so you can migrate your applications
to the newer images:
----
jenkins-agent-maven-*
jenkins-agent-nodejs-*
----

For more information, see xref:../using_images/other_images/jenkins_slaves.adoc#using-images-other-images-jenkins-slaves[Jenkins Agents].

[[ocp-310-registry]]
=== Registry

[[ocp-310-expose-registry-metrics]]
==== Expose Registry Metrics with OpenShift Authentication

The {product-title} 3.10 registry metrics endpoint is now protected by built-in
{product-title} authentication. You can use a ClusterRole to access registry metrics.

See xref:../install_config/registry/accessing_registry.adoc#accessing-registry-metrics[Accessing Registry Metrics]
for more information.

[[ocp-310-web-console]]
=== Web Console

[[ocp-310-web-console-improved-catalog-search]]
==== Improved Service Catalog Search

There is now an improved search algorithm for the service catalog UI. Weighting
is based on where the match is found and factors include the title, description,
and tagging.

[[ocp-310-web-console-improved-way-to-show-and-choose-routes]]
==== Improved Way to Show and Choose Routes for Applications

There is now an improved way to show and choose routes for an application. There
is now indication that there are multiple routes available. Annotate the route
that you would like to be primary:

----
console.alpha.openshift.io/overview-app-route: ‘true’
----

[[ocp-310-web-console-create-generic-secrets]]
==== Create Generic secrets

You can create generic secrets in the web console (secrets with any key / value
pairs). You can already create secrets, but now you can create opaque secrets.
This behaves like creating ConfigMaps.

[[ocp-310-web-console-miscellaneous-changes]]
==== Miscellaneous Changes
* The *_xterm.js_* dependency for pod terminal was updated with greatly improved performance.
* You can now create image pull secrets directly from the deploy image dialog.

[[ocp-310-security]]
=== Security

[[ocp-310-security-specify-whitelist-cipher-suite-for-etcd]]
==== Specify TLS Cipher Suite for etcd

You can set TLS cipher suites for use with etcd in order to meet security

[[ocp-310-control-sharing-pid-namespace-between-containers]]
==== Control Sharing the PID Namespace Between Containers (Technology Preview)

Control Sharing the PID Namespace Between Containers is currently in
xref:ocp-310-technology-preview[Technology Preview] and not for production
workloads.

Use this feature to configure cooperating containers in a pod, such as a log
handler sidecar container, or to troubleshoot container images that do not
include debugging utilities like a shell.

* The feature gate `PodShareProcessNamespace` is set to `false` by default.
* Set `feature-gates=PodShareProcessNamespace=true` in  the API server,
controllers, and kubelet.
* Restart the API server, controller, and node service.
* Create a pod with the specification of `shareProcessNamespace: true`.
* Run `oc create -f <pod spec file>`.

*Caveats*

When the PID namespace is shared between containers:

* Sidecar containers are not isolated.
* Environment variables are now visible to all other processes.
* Any *kill all* semantics used within the process are now broken.
* Any `exec` processes from other containers will now show up.

Persistent Volumes] for more information.

[[ocp-310-router-service-account-access-secrets]]
==== Router Service Account No Longer Needs Access to Secrets

The router service account no longer needs permission to read all secrets. This
improves security. Previously, if the router was compromised it could read all
of the most sensitive data in the cluster.

Now, when you create an ingress object, a corresponding route object is created.
If an ingress object is modified, a changed secret should take effect soon
after. If an ingress object is deleted, a route that was created for it will be
deleted.

==== Installation and Configuration Guidance Now Separated

The Installation and Configuration Guide is now separated into Installing
Clusters and Configuring Clusters for increased readability.

[[ocp-310-notable-technical-changes]]
== Notable Technical Changes

{product-title} 3.10 introduces the following notable technical changes.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-major-changes-to-cluster-architecture]]
=== Major Changes to Cluster Architecture

{product-title} 3.10 introduces major architecture changes in how control
plane and node components are deployed, affecting new installations and upgrades
from {product-title} 3.9.

The following sections highlight the most significant changes, with more detail
provided in the xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-kubernetes-infrastructure[Architecture Guide].

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-control-plane-changes]]
==== Control Plane as Static Pods

While previously run as *systemd* services or system containers, the control plane
components (apiserver, controllers, and etcd when co-located with a master) are
now run as static pods by the kubelet on master hosts. The node components
*openshift-sdn* and *openvswitch* are also now run using a DaemonSet instead of a
*systemd* service.

.Control plane host architecture changes
image::ocp310-archupgrade.png["Control plane host architecture changes"]

This is now the only supported way they can be run; system containers are no
longer supported, (sans the kublet) with the exception of the node service RHEL
Atomic Host. The upgrade will change over to the new architecture automatically.
Control plane components continue to read configurations from the
*_/etc/origin/master/_* and *_/etc/etcd/_* directories.

You can see the pods after the control plane starts using `oc get pods -n kube-system`,
and `exec`, `log`, and `inspect` them using normal `oc` CLI commands.

[discrete]
===== Why?

Static pods are managed directly by the kubelet daemon on a specific node,
without the API server having to observe it. With this simplified architecture,
master and node static pods do not have an associated replication controller,
and the kubelet daemon itself watches and restarts them if they crash. Static
pods are always bound to one kubelet daemon and always run on the same node with
it.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-nodes-bootstrapped]]
==== Nodes Bootstrapped from the Master

Nodes are now bootstrapped from the master by default, which means nodes will
pull their pre-defined configuration, client and server certificates from the
master. The 3.10 upgrade will automatically transform your nodes to use this new
mode.

.Node bootstrapping workflow overview
image::node_bootstrapping.png["Node bootstrapping workflow overview"]

[discrete]
===== Why?

The goal for bootstrapping is to allow faster node start-up by reducing the
differences between nodes, as well as centralizing more configuration and
letting the cluster converge on the desired state. This enables certificate
rotation and centralized certificate management by default (use `oc get csr` to see
pending certificates).

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-containerized-installation-removed]]
==== Containerized Installation Method Support Changes

Documentation for previous versions of {product-title} referred to the
"containerized installation method", where {product-title} components ran as
standard container images. Starting in {product-title} 3.10, support for
containerized components has changed.

The {product-title} 3.10 upgrade:

* Migrates RHEL Server hosts to the RPM-based installation method for the kubelet
* Migrates the container runtime and RHEL Atomic Hosts to the system
container-based installation method for the kubelet only (because the container
runtime is part of RHEL Atomic Host)

If you upgrade from {product-title} 3.9 to 3.10 and standalone etcd was run as
containerized on RHEL, then the installation will remain containerized after the
upgrade.

These containerized installation methods are now the only supported methods for
their respective RHEL variants, and the former method (where {product-title}
components run as standard container images) has been removed and is no longer
supported starting in 3.10.

[discrete]
===== Why?

This reduces the number of installation and upgrade paths, and aligns better
with features to be introduced in future releases.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-configuration-files]]
==== Configuration Files

To
xref:../upgrading/automated_upgrades.adoc#upgrades-defining-node-group-and-host-mappings[upgrade]
from {product-title} 3.9 to 3.10, you must first create a configuration file
that maps your previous master and node configurations to the new ConfigMap
usage, and supply the mapping when initiating your cluster upgrade. This ensures
that the upgrade does not begin without this critical information, and that you
are not left at the end of the upgrade with hosts using the previous style
deployment.

In addition, the *_/etc/sysconfig/(origin|atomic-openshift)-(api|controllers)_*
files will no longer be used. A new *_/etc/origin/master/master.env_* file can
be used to set environment variables for the static pods. The set of
configuration available as environment variables is limited (proxy and log
levels). Future versions of {product-title} will remove this configuration in
favor of control plane files, so consider the *_master.env_* file a last resort
and deprecated.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-updates-to-static-pod-images]]
=== Updates to Static Pod Images

The following images are removed:

----
openshift3/ose-*
openshift3/container-engine-*
openshift3/node-*
openshift3/openvswitch-*
----

These images are replaced with:

----
openshift3/ose-node-*
openshift3/ose-control-plane-*
----

The image `openshift3/metrics-schema-installer-container` is also added.

The image `openshift3/ose-sti-builder` is now replaced by
`openshift3/ose-docker-builder`, which already existed.

See
xref:../install/disconnected_install.adoc#disconnected-syncing-images[Syncing

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-pod-flag-removed]]
=== Pod Flag Removed for oc port-forward

The deprecated `-p <POD>` flag for `oc port-forward` is removed. Use `oc port-forward pod/<POD>` instead.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-specify-api-group-and-version-without-api-prefix]]
=== Specify the API Group and Version without the API prefix

When enabling or disabling API groups with the `--runtime-config` flag in
`kubernetesMasterConfig.apiServerArguments`, specify `<group>/<version>` without
the API prefix. In future releases, the API prefix will be disallowed. For
example:

----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  apiServerArguments:
    runtime-config:
    - apps.k8s.io/v1beta1=false
    - apps.k8s.io/v1beta2=false
...

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-o-name-includes-api-group]]
=== Output of -o name Now Includes API Group

The output format of `-o name` now includes the API group and singular kind. For

imagestream.image.openshift.io/my-image-stream
----

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-deprecated-web-console-suport-for-IE-11]]
===  Deprecated Web Console Support for Internet Explorer 11

Web console support for Internet Explorer (IE) 11 is now deprecated. This will
be removed in a future version of {product-title}. Microsoft Edge is still a
supported browser.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-local-provosioner-configuration-changes]]
=== Local Provisioner Configuration Changes

Adding a new device is semi-automatic. The provisioner periodically checks for
new mounts in the configured directories. The administrator needs to create a
new subdirectory there, mount a device there, and allow the pods to use the
device by applying the SELinux label.

See
xref:../install_config/configuring_local.adoc#install-config-configuring-local[Configuring
for Local Volume] for more information.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-openstack-configuration-updates]]
=== OpenStack Configuration Updates

When configuring the Red Hat OpenStack cloud provider, the node's host name must
match the instance name in OpenStack to ensure that the registered name conforms
to DNS-1123 specification.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-deprecated-openshift-namespace-flag-removed]]
=== Deprecated openshift-namespace Flag Now Removed

The deprecated `openshift-namespace` flag is now removed from the `oc adm
create-bootstrap-policy-file` command.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-deprecated-openshift_set_node_ip-and-openshift_ip]]
=== Use of openshift_set_node_ip and openshift_ip Are No Longer Supported

In {product-title} 3.10, the use of `openshift_set_node_ip` and `openshift_ip`
are no longer supported.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-you-can-no-longer-configure-dnsip]]
=== You Can No Longer Configure dnsIP

It is no longer possible to configure the `dnsIP` value of the node, which could
previously be set via `openshift_dns_ip`.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-deprecated-openshift_hostname]]
=== Removed openshift_hostname Variable

The `openshift_hostname` variable is now removed.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-openshift_docker_additional_registries-discouraged]]
=== Use of openshift_docker_additional_registries Discouraged

Do not use or rely on `openshift_docker_additional_registries`.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-openshift-infra-for-system-components]]
=== openshift-infra Reserved for System Components
The `openshift-infra` namespace is reserved for system components. It does not
run {product-title} admission plug-ins for Kubernetes resources. SCC admission will not
run for pods in the `openshift-infra` namespace. This can cause pods to fail,
especially if they make use of persistent volume claims and rely on SCC-assigned
`uid`/`fsGroup`/`supplementalGroup`/`seLinux` settings.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-oc-edit-respects-kube-editor]]
=== oc edit Respects Kube_EDITOR
The `oc edit` command now respects `KUBE_EDITOR`. `OC_EDITOR` support will be
removed in a future release, so it is recommended that you switch to
`KUBE_EDITOR`.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-batch-v2alpha1-api-no-longer-served-by-default]]
=== batch/v2alpha1 API Version No Longer Served by Default

The `batch/v2alpha1` API version is no longer served by default. If required, it
can be re-enabled in the *_master-config.yaml_* file with this configuration:

----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  apiServerArguments:
    ...
    runtime-config:
    - apis/batch/v2alpha1=true
----

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-new-openshift_additional_ca-option]]
=== New openshift_additional_ca Option

There is a new option in the OpenShift Ansible installer,
`openshift_additional_ca`, which points to a file containing the load balancer
CA certificate. If the cluster is using a load balancer which requires a
difference CA than the one generated by the installer for the the master node,
then the user will need to add this additional CA certificate to the
*_/etc/origin/master/ca-bundle.crt_* file. This will make it available to pods
in the cluster.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-namespace-scoped-requests]]
=== Namespace-scoped Requests

`subjectaccessreviews.authorization.openshift.io` and
`resourceaccessreviews.authorization.openshift.io` will be cluster-scoped only
in a future release. Use `localsubjectaccessreviews.authorization.openshift.io`
and `localresourceaccessreviews.authorization.openshift.io` if you need
namespace-scoped requests.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-default-image-streams-use-pullthrough]]
=== Default Image Streams Now Use Pullthrough

The default image streams now use pullthrough. This means that the internal
registry will pull these images on behalf of the user. If you modify the
upstream location of the images in the image stream, the registry will pull from
that location. This means the registry must be able to trust the upstream
location. If your upstream location uses a certificate that is not part of the
standard system trust store, pulls will fail. You will need to mount the
appropriate trust store into the docker-registry pod to provide appropriate
certificates in this case, in the *_/etc/tls_* directory path.

The image import process now runs inside a pod (the apiserver pod). Image import
needs to trust registries it is importing from. If the source registry uses a
certicate that is not signed by a CA that is in the standard system store, you
will need to provide appropriate trust store information to the apiserver pod.
This can be done by mounting content into to the pod's *_/etc/tls_* directory.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-use-local-flag]]
=== Use a Local Flag to Avoid Contacting the Server

In a future release, when invoking `oc` commands against a local file, you must use a
`--local` flag when you do not want the client to contact the server.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-deprecated-gitlab-versions]]
=== Deprecated GitLab Versions
The use of self-hosted versions of GitLab with a version less than v11.1.0 is
now deprecated. Users of self hosted versions should upgrade their GitLab
installation as soon as possible. No action is required if the hosted version at
gitlab.com is used, as that environment is always running the latest version.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-flexvolume-updates]]
=== Flexvolume Plug-in Updates

When using flexvolume for performing `attach`/`detach`, the flex binary must not
have external dependencies and should be self contained. Flexvolume plug-in path
on atomic hosts has been changed to *_/etc/origin/kubelet-plugins_*, which applies to
both master and compute nodes.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-deprecated-oc-rollout-latest]]

=== Deprecated oc rollout latest ... --output=revision
In {product-title} 3.10, `oc rollout latest ... --output=revision` is
deprecated. Use `oc rollout latest ... --output
jsonpath={.status.latestVersion}` or `oc rollout latest ... --output
go-template={{.status.latestVersion}` instead.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-CNS-is-now-RHOCS]]

=== CNS Is Now Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage (RHOCS)

Container Native Storage (CNS) is now called Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage
(RHOCS). Previously, there was confusion between CNS and CRS terminology.

[discrete]
[[ocp-310-builder-image-replaced]]
=== Builder Image Replaced

In {product-title} 3.10, the *Atomic OpenShift Docker Builder*,
`registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-docker-builder`, replaced the
*Atomic OpenShift S2I Builder*, `registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-sti-builder`.

Previously, the *Atomic OpenShift Docker Builder* was responsible for executing
container image builds. It now executes source-to-image (s2i) image builds as well.

[[ocp-310-bug-fixes]]
== Bug Fixes

This release fixes bugs for the following components:

*Builds*

* Some build container environment variables were modified when redacted in the
container log. As a result, URL proxy settings (such as HTTP/S proxies) were
modified, breaking these settings. A copy of these environment variables are
made prior to redaction in the logs.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1571349[*BZ#11571349*])

* Streaming of build logs failed due to a server-side timeout waiting for the
build pod to start. Therefore,  `oc start-build` could hang if the `--wait` and
`--follow` flags were set. With this bug fix:
+
** Server-side timeout for a build pod to start was increased from 10 to 30 seconds.
** If  the `--follow` flag is specified and the log streaming fails, return an error message to the user.
** If `--follow` and `--wait` is specified, retry log streaming.
+
As a result:
+
** Log stream failures due to build pod wait timeouts are less likely to occur.
** If `--follow` fails, the user is presented with the message *Failed to stream the build logs - to view the logs, run oc logs build/<build-name>*.
** If `--follow` and `--wait` flags are set, `oc start-build` will retry fetching the build logs until successful.
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1575990[*BZ#1575990*])

* The build watch maintained by the *openshift jenkins sync* plug-in would no
longer function, even while watchers on other API object types still functioned.
The finding of a build would then fall upon the background build list thread,
which by default runs at 5-minute intervals. This bug fix adds better logging
around unexpected closure of the *openshift jenkins sync* plug-in watches, adds
reconnect when those closures occur, and adds the ability for customers to
configure the relist interval. Now,  customers do not have to wait up to 5
minutes for the pipeline strategy builds to start.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1554902[*BZ#1554902*])

* The build controller was susceptible to incorrectly failing builds when time was
not synchronized accurately between multiple masters. The controller logic is
now improved to not depend on time synchronization.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1547551[*BZ#1547551*])

* The webhook payload can contain an empty commit array, which results in an array
indexing error when processed by the APIserver. As a result, the API server
crashes. Check for an empty array before attempting to index into it. With this
bug fix, empty commit payloads are handled without crashing the API server.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1585663[*BZ#1585663*])

*Containers*

* An invalid SELinux context for the Docker engine prevented `docker exec` to
work. With this bug fix, the issue is resolved.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1517212[*BZ#1517212*])

*Image*

* Jenkins would fail to parse certificates with the *Bag Attributes* preceding the
`BEGIN CERTIFICATE` line and fail to start since the *openshift jenkins* image
adds such a certificate to the Kubernetes cloud configuration. With this bug
fix,  remove the  *Bag Attributes* preceding the `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` line in the
certificates mounted into the pod; generally validate the certificate for proper
format. Jenkins can now start when such certificates are introduced.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1548619[*BZ#1548619*])

* A new value in the `Reference` field was not considered as a change. Therefore,
the status field was not  updated. This bug fix updates detection of changes.
You can now set `Reference: true` and get any image reference in an image stream
tag. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1555149[*BZ#1555149*])

* Additional certificate name constraints prevented valid certificates from being
processed, resulting in  an error of "tls: failed to parse certificate from
server: x509: unhandled critical extension". As a result, valid certificates
were unusable. By moving to newer golang libraries that fixed the constraint.
certificates that previously failed can now be used.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1518583[*BZ#1518583*])

* Previously, PhantomJS would not install on `jenkins-slave-base-rhel7` image.
this was because PhantomJS is packaged as `tar.bz2` archive and
`jenkins-slave-base-rhel7` did not contain the bzip2 binary. The {product-title}
version 3.10, includes newer Jenkins image with bzip2 binary.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1544693[*BZ#1544693*])


*Installer*

* Due to a compatibility issue in earlier versions, the `networkPluginName` entry
was listed twice in the `node-config.yaml`. The duplicate entry is no longer
needed and has been removed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1567970[*BZ#1567970*])

* Due to a change in the installer, if using images from a registry other than the
default, you need to configure the registry using the `oreg_url` parameter in
the *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file for all components and images. Previously, you
needed to configure the `oreg_url`, `openshift_docker_additional_registries`,
and `openshift_docker_insecure_registries`  parameters.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1516534[*BZ#1516534*])

* Environments where the Azure cloud provider is enabled now provision a default
storage class for use with Azure storage.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1537479[*BZ#1537479*])

* You can now uninstall the Service Catalog using the Ansible Playbook if the
*openshift-ansible-serivce-broker* project is not present. Previously, the
uninstall playbook would fail if the project is not present.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1561485[*BZ#1561485*])

* Because NFS storage cannot provide the file system capabilities required by
OpenShift registry, logging, and metrics components, a check has been added to
the installer that will not allow NFS storage for these components. To use NFS
storage for these components, you must opt-in by setting the cluster variable
`openshift_enable_unsupported_configurations` to `true`, otherwise the procedure
will fail. The use of NFS storage for registry, metrics, and logging components
is only supported for proof of concept environments and not for production
environments.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1416639[*BZ#1416639*])

* Ansible playbooks were taking too long to execute and could result in
certificate errors from hosts that are not relevant to the task being performed.
The playbooks have been modified to check only relevant hosts.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1516526[*BZ#1516526*])

* Ansible installer playbooks were creating persistent volumes before creating
storage classes causing the playbooks to be run twice. The playbooks were
changed to create the storage classes before any persistent volumes.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1564170[*BZ#1564170*])

* Because the way the OpenShift prefix and version were set for the console, the
version reported by the console was different than the version displayed by
other components. Control plane upgrade now ensures that the console version
matches the version of other control plane components.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1540427[*BZ#1540427*])

* Because of the Ansible installation playbooks, you needed to manually configure
 storage classes after installation in order to create PVCs. You can now
 configure storage classes at installation time by setting the following
 parameters in your inventory file:
+
----
openshift_storageclass_name=test-1
openshift_storageclass_provisioner=rbd
openshift_storageclass_parameters={'fstype': 'ext4', 'iopsPerGB': '10', 'foo': 'bar'}
----
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1471718[*BZ#1471718*])

* The certificate expiration playbook, *_easy-mode.yaml_*, was not checking all
certificate files for expiration information. As a result, expired files were
not being discovered, which could result in errors. The Ansible playbook has
been updated.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1520971[*BZ#1520971*])

* Previously, dnsmasq was configured to listen on a specific IP address in an
effort to avoid binding to `127.0.0.1:53`, which is where the node service runs
its DNS service. This update configures dnsmasq to bind to all interfaces except
the loopback, which ensures that dnsmasq works properly on hosts with multiple
interfaces.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1481366[*BZ#1481366*])

* In rare cases, the router or registry `registryurl` variables may need to be set
to values other than the first `master registry_url` value. This fix allows the
`openshift_hosted_router_registryurl` and
`openshift_hosted_registry_registryurl` variables to be set in the inventory.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1509853[*BZ#1509853*])

* A recent change in SELinux policy requires that an additional SEBoolean is set
when running any pods with systemd which includes CFME.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1587825[*BZ#1587825*])

*Logging*

* The `kube-` and `openshift-` prefixes are preserved for internal use cases. to
avoid name conflict, it is better to use the preserved prefix as default
logging project. This fix uses the preserved prefix as the default logging
project. This fits the pattern used by other infrastructure applications and
allows the EFK stack to participate with other services that assume the
infrastructure is deployed to namespaces with a known pattern (for example,
`openshift-`).
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1535300[*BZ#1535300*])

* A utility *_logging-dump.sh_* dumps the ElasticSearch logs as part of useful
information for troubleshooting. In {product-title} 3.10, the log location of
ElasticSearch has been moved from *_/elasticsearch/logging-es[-ops]/logs_* to
*_/elasticsearch/persistent/logging-es[-ops]/logs_*. *_logging-dump.sh_* fails
to dump ElasticSearch logs with a an error of *Unable to get ES logs from pod
<ES_POD_NAME>*. In addition to *_/elasticsearch/logging-es[-ops]/logs_*, check
the new path *_/elasticsearch/persistent/logging-es[-ops]/logs_* for the logs
files. With this bug fix, *_logging-dump.sh_* successfully dumps ElasticSearch
logs. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1588416[*BZ#1588416*])

*Web Console*

* Previously, if a pod took more than five minutes to become ready, the web
console would warn you, regardless of `timeoutSeconds` specified in the
deployment configuration. For some applications, this period was too short. This
fix removes this warning from the web console. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1550138[*BZ#1550138*])

* Prior to this release, the copy and paste operation in the web console container
terminal did not work properly on Firefox and Internet Explorer. This fix
updates `xterm.js` to `v3.1.0`. You can now copy and paste from the context menu or
using keyboard shortcuts.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1278733[*BZ#1278733*])

* When the “No results match” result occurred in the Console or Catalog page,
 there were two links for clearing the search keys, “Clear Filters” and “Clear
 All Filters”. With this fix, all occurrences of “Clear Filters” were changed to
 “Clear All Filters”. Now there is one option to clear filters.
 (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1549450[*BZ#1549450*])

* Different BuildConfig Webhook URLs were obtained by the CLI and Web Console.
This caused the CLI to use the the correct *build.openshift.io* API group, while
the Web Console did not use an API group. This fix updated the Webhook filter to
use the correct *build.openshift.io* API group for the Web Console, and as a
result the the correct URL for the BuildConfig Webhook is provided.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1559325[*BZ#1559325*])

* Manually typing a URL with a non-existing image, such as
`/console/project/pro1/browse/images/non-existent-image`, caused the loading
screen to freeze even though the process was finished and the alert, “The image
stream details could not be loaded”, to be displayed. With this fix, the loaded
scope variable is set when the image is or is not loaded and is used in the view
to hide the loading screen. As a result, following the attempt to load the image
data, the screen will not freeze on loading.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1550797[*BZ#1550797*])

* Previously, the web console did not support deploying an application with private
repository image on the *Deploy Image* page. This is fixed and users can now
deploy an app with a private repository image.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1489374[*BZ#1489374*])

*Master*

* Previously, DaemonSet nodes were restricted with project default node selector,
causing the creation and deletion of DaemonSet pods in a loop on those nodes.
This fix patched upstream DaemonSet logic to be aware of project default node
selector. As a result, creation and deletion loop of DaemonSet pods on the nodes
that got restricted by project default node selector is resolved.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1501514[*BZ#1501514*])

* Previously, the client was not able to read full discovery but was stuck on the
first aggregated server which was temporarily unavailable. This led to not
having the proper information about all the resources that were available. This
fix introduced a default timeout for discovery actions. As a result, in case of
a failure on an aggregated server the client will continue discovering resources
on other servers and allow users to work with the ones that are available.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1525014[*BZ#1525014*])

* Previously, when pods that used DeploymentConfigs with the recreate strategy
were evicted, a new pod did not come online until the timeout interval elapsed.
Now the the recreate strategy creates a new pod even if evicted pods are
present.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1549931[*BZ#1549931*])

*Metrics*

* Previously, the `auto_snapshot` parameter was set to `true` in the
*_cassandra.yaml_* file, and because of changes to Hawkular Metrics introduced
in {product-title} 3.7, so many snapshots were generated that the disk might
fill up. Now `auto_snapshot` is disabled by default, and snapshots are generated
only if you set the `openshift_metrics_cassandra_take_snapshot` property to
`true` in the Ansible inventory file.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1567251[*BZ#1567251*])

* Previously, you could not distribute multiple CA certificates to pods in the
cluster. This limitation caused issues with load balancer configurations that
required a different CA certificate than the one generated by the installer for
the the master node. Now you can define the location of the load balancer
certificate in the `openshift_additional_ca` parameter during installation. The
certificate is added to the  *_/etc/origin/master/ca-bundle.crt_* file, which is
made available to pods in the cluster.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1535585[*BZ#1535585*])

* In version 3.9, the Prometheus service account did not have the required
permissions to access the metrics endpoint of the router, so Prometheus could
not obtain the router's metrics. Now the Prometheus service account has the
necessary additional role to access the metrics endpoint and can obtain metrics
from the router.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1565095[*BZ#1565095*])

*Networking*

* Previously, the service controller sent a request to the cloud provider every
time a service was created. This request checked whether the cloud provider had
a load balancer for the service, even for non-LoadBalancer services. In clusters
where many services were created, the extra requests dominated some cloud
provider API usage. The service controller no longer sends this request to the
cloud provider when a non-LoadBalancer service is created, which reduces the
cloud provider API usage.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1571940[*BZ#1571940*])

* Previously, the egress router configuration prevented egress router pods from
connecting to the public IP address of the nodes that host them. If an egress
pod was configured to use its node as a name server in the *_/etc/resolv.conf_*
file, DNS resolution failed. Traffic from an egress router pod to its node is
now routed via the SDN tunnel instead of through the egress interface. Egress
routers can now connect to their node's IP, and egress router DNS works.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1552738[*BZ#1552738*])

* If two nodes swapped IP addresses after you rebooted them, other
nodes were sometimes unable to send traffic to pods on one or both of those
nodes. Now, the OVS flow correctly manage node IP address reassignment, and
pod-to-pod traffic continues even if nodes swap IP addresses.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1538220[*BZ#1538220*])

* Previously, changing an EgressIP of a NetNamespace while its existing EgressIP
is active, assigned duplicate EgressIPs to the NetNamespaces of the same
HostSubnets, resulting in egress IPs to stop working if an egress IP is moved
from one project or node to another. Additionally, if the same egress IP is
assigned to two different projects, or two different nodes, then it may not work
correctly even after the duplicate assignment is removed. The EgressIPs field on
a NetNamespace have been fixed to change while the egress IP is active. This
results in static per-project egress IPs should work more reliably.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1551028[*BZ#1551028*])

* The kube-proxy and kubelet parts of the OpenShift node process were being given
different default values for the configuration options describing how to
interact with iptables. This resulted in OpenShift periodically add a false
iptables rule that would cause some per-project static egress IPs to not be used
for some length of time, until the false rule was removed again. While the bogus
rule was present, traffic from those projects would use the node IP address of
the node hosting the egress IP, rather than the egress IP itself. The
inconsistent configuration was resolved, causing the false iptables rule to no
longer be added, and projects now consistently use their static egress IPs.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1552869[*BZ#1552869*])

* Previously, OpenShift's default network plug-in did not contain the newest
NetworkPolicy features introduced upstream in Kubernetes. These included
policies for controlling egress, and policies based on IP addresses rather than
pods or namespaces. This meant that in version 3.9, creating a NetworkPolicy
with an `ipBlock` stanza would cause nodes to crash, and creating a
NetworkPolicy that contained only "egress" rules would erroneously cause ingress
traffic to be blocked. Now, {product-title} is aware of the unsupported
NetworkPolicy features, though it does not yet implement them, and if a
NetworkPolicy contains `ipBlock` rules, those rules are ignored. This may cause
the policy to be treated as "deny all" if the `ipBlock` rule was the only rule
in the policy. If a NetworkPolicy contains only "egress" rules, it is ignored
completely and does not affect ingress.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1583255[*BZ#1583255*])

* When deleting a pod, some of the IP files were not deleted as intended. This was
caused by the garbage collection picking up a dead container. The kubelet keeps
the information from at least one container in the case of if a restart is
needed. This bug fix ensures that a proper clean up happens only if the network
plug-in returns success, but some other error happens after that before the
runtime (eg. dockershim or CRI-O) returns to kubelet.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1532965[*BZ#1532965*])

* Previously, the *dnsmasq* service would randomly freeze and would need a manual
restart to start the resolution. This caused no logs to be captured for the
*dnsmasq* service on {product-title} node hosts. This was caused by the
interface connecting with *dnsmasq* changing between releases, overloading the
service. The `dns-forward-max` and `cache-size` option limits have been
increased to 10000, and the service now works as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1560489[*BZ#1560489*])

* The updated egress policy needed to block outgoing traffic, patch OVS flows, and
then re-enable traffic. However, the OVS flow generation for DNS names was slow.
This resulted in a few seconds of egress traffic downtime. With this bug fix,
egress policy handling is updated to pre-populate all new OVS flows before
blocking the outgoing traffic. This reduces the downtime during egress policy
updates.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1558484[*BZ#1558484*])

* Due to incorrect cleanup of the internal state, if you deleted a "static
per-project egress IPs" from one project and then tried to reuse that IP for a
different project, the OVS rules for the new project would be created
incorrectly. The egress IP would not be used for the new project, and might
start being used again for some traffic from the old project. The internal state
is now cleaned up correctly when removing an egress IP and egress traffic works
as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1543786[*BZ#1543786*])

* When using per-namespace static egress IPs, all external traffic is routed
through the egress IP. _External_ means all traffic  that is not directed to
another pod, and so includes traffic from the pod to the pod's node. When pods
are told to use the node's IP address for DNS, and the pod is using a static
egress IP, then DNS traffic will be routed to the egress node first, and then
back to the original node, which might be configured to not accept DNS requests
from other hosts, causing the pod to be unable to resolve DNS. Pod-to-node DNS
requests now bypass the egress IP and go directly to the node and DNS works.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1557924[*BZ#1557924*])

*Pod*

* Previously, errors and warning messages for the `oc describe` command were not
clear. This issue is fixed now.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1523778[*BZ#1523778*])

* Previously, the garbage collector tried to delete images that were in use by
stopped containers. Changes are made in the {product-title} version 3.10, which
prevents garbage collector from attempting to remove images in use by stopped
containers.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1577739[*BZ#1577739*])

* The `cpu-cfs-quota` used to get applied, even if the `node-config.yaml` file had
`cpu-cfs-quota` set to `false`. This happened because the container cgroup for
`cfs` quota was unbound, but the pod level cgroup was bounded. This issue is now
fixed, changes were made so that the pod level cgroups remain unbounded. Now if
`cpu-cfs-quota` is set to `false`, it ignores any limits from being enforced.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1581409[*BZ#1581409*])

* The web console was incorrectly assigning `extensions/v1beta1` as the API
version when creating HPA resources, regardless of the actual group of the scale
target. This issue is fixed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1543043[*BZ#1543043*])

*Routing*

* Previously, the HAProxy config failed to load causing router to not service any
routes. This was because the Headless service had `service.Spec.ClusterIP=None`
field set, which was not getting ignored as part of un-idling. This is fixed,
the HAProxy config ignore headless services during unidle handling and the
router service routes as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1567532[*BZ#1567532*])

* Path based routes did not work as expected for mixed TLS scenarios. Splitting up
of the route types into separate map files caused this issue. Causing haproxy to
match the wrong route. Maps are now merged automatically and they are searched
appropriately to correctly match the incoming requests with the corresponding
backends.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1534816[*BZ#1534816*])

* When upgrading the HAProxy container image, no logging of requests occurs by
default. If logging was requested using the `httplog` option, a warning message
was shown, as this option is not available on a TCP-only connection. In this
situation, HAProxy will fall back to using the `tcplog` option instead. The
warning message is therefore harmless and has been removed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1533346[*BZ#1533346*])

*Service Broker*

* The `type: openshift` registry adapter does not support discovery of APB images.
This means that users of this registry adapter must manually include a list of
images to bootstrap. This enhancement introduces the use of a new registry
adapter, `type: partner_rhcc`, which works with
https://registry.connect.redhat.com, and supports image discovery without this
manual requirement.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1576881[*BZ#1576881*])

* When attempting to deprovision a service instance, an error was occurring during
the process, combined with an invalid response body, which was causing the
deprovision process to fail. Changes have now been implemented to return the
proper response body with the operation key, and to enhance the overall
robustness of the deprovisioning workflow, which will increase the likelihood of
successful deprovisioning.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1562732[*BZ#1562732*])

* According to the Open Source Broker (OSB) API documentation, if a binding
exists, a status of `200 OK` must be returned from a binding call. An issue had
been occurring where an incorrect response code (`201`) was being returned
instead. This issue has been fixed by introducing support for asynchronous
bindings.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1563560[*BZ#1563560*])

*Service Catalog*

* When a service class is removed from a provisioned service instance in the
service broker’s catalog, the service catalog marks the class as
`removedFromBrokerCatalog: true`. This prevents the class from being used in new
service plans or instances. An issue was preventing this status from being reset
to `removedFromBrokerCatalog: false` if the service class is re-added to the
broker catalog, and was preventing removed classes from being used again later.
This issue is now resolved.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1548122[*BZ#1548122*])

* The Prometheus console did not previously allow access to service catalog
metrics, which were only available using curl in the back end. The service
catalog controller now exposes metrics for Prometheus to scrape, which enables
monitoring of the service catalog.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1549021[*BZ#1549021*])

*Storage*

* The capacity of the local persistent storage volume (PV) was being reported in
some cases as different to that reported by the `df` utility. This was due to a
lack of propagation of newly mounted devices to the pods, resulting in an
additional PV being created for the configured directory. The capacity of this
newly created PV was equal to the root device. This propagation issue has now
been fixed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1490722[*BZ#1490722*])

* When the API call quota for in the AWS cloud was reached, certain AWS API calls
returned errors. These errors were not correctly handled when detaching AWS
persistent Volumes, with some AWS volumes remaining attached to the nodes
despite there being no pod using them. The volumes had to be detached manually,
otherwise they became stuck forever. This bug fix updates the AWS API call error
handling for dynamic volume detaching. As a result, even when the AWS API call
quota is reached, the attach/detach controller re-tries to detach the volume
until it succeeds, ensuring the volumes that should be detached are actually
detached.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1537236[*BZ#1537236*])

*Testing*

* Previously, when `masterConfig.ImagePolicyConfig.ExternalRegistryHostname` was
added for the *_master-config.yaml_* and the API and controller service was
restarted, the API pod would recreate, but the controllers pod would error with
`CrashLoopBackOff`. Having an `m3.large` instance in AWS resolves the issue.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1593635[*BZ#1593635*])

*Upgrading*

* You can now define a set of hooks to run arbitrary tasks during the node upgrade
process. To implement these hooks set `openshift_node_upgrade_pre_hook`,
`openshift_node_upgrade_hook`, or `openshift_node_upgrade_post_hook` to the path
of the task file you wish to execute. The `openshift_node_upgrade_pre_hook` hook
is executed after draining the node and before it has been upgraded. The
`openshift_node_upgrade_hook` is executed after the node has been drained and
packages updated but before it is marked schedulable again. The
`openshift_node_upgrade_post_hook` hook is executed after the node has been
marked schedulable immediately before moving on to other nodes.

[[ocp-310-known-issues]]
== Known Issues

* There is one known Kubelet wedge state that will be fixed in the 1.10 rebase
where the Kubelet will display messages like *system:anonymous cannot access
resource foo*. This means that the certificates expired before the kubelet could
refresh them. If restarting the kubelet does not fix the issue, delete the
contents of *_/etc/origin/node/certificates/_*, and then restart the kubelet.

* The blue-green node deployment method as documented in
xref:../upgrading/blue_green_deployments.adoc#install-config-upgrading-automated-upgrades[Upgrading
Clusters]
should only be used for the initial upgrade path from {product-title} 3.9 to
3.10. It will be further updated when the first
xref:ocp-310-asynchronous-errata-updates[asynchronous {product-title} 3.10.z update]
is released.

* In the GA release of the
xref:../upgrading/downgrade.adoc#install-config-downgrade[Downgrading OpenShift]
documentation, an issue was found with the steps for restoring etcd. The
document has since been updated and this is no longer an issue.

* {product-title} 3.10 adds the ability for multiple instances of an APB to be
invoked in the same namespace. This new ability requires relying on a globally
unique identifier (GUID) for each instance. While instances deployed by an 3.9
version of an APB lack the GUID, 3.10 APBs require it.
+
--
A 3.10 APB is unable to manage a 3.9 deployed service because it lacks the
newly required GUID. This causes clusters upgraded from 3.9 to 3.10 to result in
an error if an application that was previously deployed on 3.9 is then
deprovisioned from 3.10 APB.

There are two workarounds to this issue currently:

* After the cluster upgrade to 3.10 has completed, delete the namespace of the
application and recreate it. This will use the 3.10 version of the APB and
function as expected.

* Modify the configuration of the OpenShift Ansible broker to remain on the 3.9
version of APBs. This is not recommended, however, as it has the downside of the
broker using 3.10 code while the APBs use the older 3.9 version:

.. Follow the procedure in
xref:../install_config/oab_broker_configuration.adoc#install-config-oab-modifying[Modifying the OpenShift Ansible Broker Configuration] to change the label to `v3.9`.
.. Run the `apb bootstrap` command to bootstrap the broker and relist the catalog.

[[ocp-3-10-34]]
=== RHBA-2018:2376 - {product-title} 3.10.34 Bug Fix and Enhancement Update

Issued: 2018-08-28

{product-title} release 3.10.34 is now available. The list of packages and
bug fixes included in the update are documented in the

details on the bug fixes and enhancements included in this release.

[[ocp-3-10-34-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* When Mux is configured and it fails to find a project or namespace that a log
 belongs to, the log was indexed into `project.mux-undefined` where
 `mux-undefined` was a Mux default namespace. At the same time, the fluentd
 (without Mux configuration) puts such logs into the *_.orphaned.YYYY.MM.DD_*
 index. With this bug fix, such orphaned logs are also indexed into the
 *_.orphaned.YYYY.MM.DD_* index for the Mux case.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1538560[*BZ#1538560*])

* The installer was creating an incorrect `spec` attribute for CPU and memory.
Additionally, it did not allow modifying the CPU limit. Therefore, the values
were ignored. Conditionally patch in `cpu_limit` if it is defined and correct
the attribute name used to specify CPU and memory requests. With this bug fix,
the values are honored as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1575546[*BZ#1575546*])

* The Ansible template did not quote the value in the selector, producing invalid
JSON. The selector value is now quoted and a PVC can be created with the
selector.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1597282[*BZ#1597282*])

* The 9100 port is blocked on all nodes by default. Prometheus can not scrape the
*node_exporter* service running on the other nodes, which listens on port 9100.
The firewall configuration is now modified to allow incoming TCP traffic for the
9000-1000 port range and Prometheus can scrape the *node_exporter* services.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1600562[*BZ#1600562*])

* Recently, `cloudResourceSyncManager` was implemented, which continuously fetched
node addresses from cloud providers. Kubelet then received node addresses from
the `cloudResourceSyncManager`. At the time of node registration or kubelet
start, kubelet fetches node addresses in a blocking loop from
`cloudResourceSyncManager`. The issue was that `cloudResourceSyncManager` was
not started before kubelet had started fetching node addresses from it for the
first time and, due to this, kubelet got stuck in the blocking loop and never
returned. It caused node failures at network level, and no node could be
registered. Also, as kubelet blocked early, the `cloudResourceSyncManager` never
got a chance to start. `CloudResourceSyncManager` is now started early in the
kubelet start up process so that kubelet does not get blocked on it and
`cloudResourceSyncManager` is always started.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1603611[*BZ#1603611*])

* If a node selector was provided as a value of `true`, it was interpreted as a
boolean and would cause daemonset deployment to fail. The template for creating
the daemonset is now updated to quote the provided value to ensure it is
interpreted as a string.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1609027[*BZ#1609027*])

* Groups associated with a user were not checked when performing access checks to
look up the readiness of objects created by the templates. For objects the user
could only access due to their group membership, objects would be created by the
template, but could not be checked for readiness, resulting in a readiness
failure at the template instance level. Pass the user's groups when performing
the readiness check operation, not just when performing the object creation.
Objects can now successfully be checked for readiness as long as the user's
group membership permits the check.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1610994[*BZ#1610994*])

* There was a race condition when piping output from a tar stream extraction.
Binary builds with large numbers of files could hang indefinitely. The tar
streaming logic is now reverted to use a previous mechanism, which does not have
a race condition. Binary builds with large numbers of files now complete
normally.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1614493[*BZ#1614493*])

* By default, older versions of dnsmasq can use privileged, lower-numbered source
ports for outbound DNS queries. Outbound DNS queries could be dropped; for
example, firewall rules might drop queries coming from reserved ports. dnsmasq
is now configured using its `min-port` setting to set the minimum port number
for outbound queries to `1024`. DNS queries should no longer be dropped.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1614984[*BZ#1614984*])

*  Ansible 2.6.0 will not evaluate undefined variables with `|bool` as `false`. You
must define a `| default(false)` for `logging_elasticsearch_rollout_override`.
With this bug fix, the playbook executes successfully.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1615194[*BZ#1615194*])

[[ocp-3-10-34-enhancements]]
==== Enhancements

* The default fluentd memory is increased to `756m`. Performance and scaling testing
demonstrated that fluentd requires more memory after recent improvements to
avoid out of memory failures and container restarts. Fluentd is now less likely
to run out of memory.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1600258[*BZ#1600258*])

* During an upgrade, a check is performed to see if the node is running CRI-O as a
system container. If so, the CRI-O system container is uninstalled and the
CRI-O RPM is installed. Running CRI-O as a system container is unsupported. In
some cases during a {product-title} 3.9 installation, a node may inadvertently
be installed with CRI-O as a system container. Nodes upgraded from
{product-title} 3.9 to 3.10 will be converted to a supported configuration with
CRI-O running from an RPM.

release in the advisory. See the following sections for notes on upgrading and
details on the bug fixes and enhancements included in this release.

[[ocp-3-10-83-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* A CA certificate was passed to `openshift-ansible` during an installation or
upgrade containing more than one certificate. The installation or upgrade was
unable to sign the CSR and `atomic-openshift-node` fails to start.
`openshift-ansible` failed if a CA was provided or already existed on the
cluster, which does not contain exactly one certificate. The installation or
upgrade fails and the user is now notified of the reason, as well as provided
steps to resolve the issue.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1614425[*BZ#1614425*])

* Kibana index pattern seeding was modified to reduce the number of entries in the
drop-list that were visible to cluster admins. Cluster admins navigating to
Kibana for logging from the web console were no longer sent to the correct URL.
Take into consideration a user's `cluster-admi`n role when creating the web
console link to pod logs in Kibana. With this bug fix, the link is created
correctly.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1624406[*BZ#1624406*])

* There was inconsistent user usage when creating and removing temporary
directories. Removing the directories can fail if the user does not have proper
access. With this bug fix update, tasks use same `become:false settings` and the
removal does not fail when using different user.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1632273[*BZ#1632273*])

* When fluentd is configured as the combination of collectors and MUX, event logs
from the event were supposed to be processed by MUX, not by the collector for
the both `MUX_CLIENT_MODE` maximal and minimal. This occurred because if an event
log is formatted in the collector (the event record is put under the Kubernetes
key), the log is forwarded to MUX and passed to the k8s-meta plug-in there and
the existing Kubernetes record is overwritten. It removed the event information
from the log.
+
*Fix 1*: To avoid the replacement, if the log is from event router,
the tag is rewritten to `${tag}.raw` in *_input-post-forward-mux.conf_*, which
treats the log in the `MUX_CLIENT_MODE=minimal` way.
+
*Fix 2*: There was another
bug in Ansible in that the environment variable `TRANSFORM_EVENTS` was not set
in MUX even if `openshift_logging_install_eventrouter` was set to `true`.
+
With these two fixes, the event logs are correctly logged when MUX is configured
with `MUX_CLIENT_MODE=maximal` as well as `minimal`.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1632892[*BZ#11632892*])

* The event router intentionally generates duplicate event logs so that they are not lost. This big fix extended the `elasticsearch_genid` plug-in to `elasticsearch_genid_ext` so
that it takes the `alt_key` and `alt_tag`. If a log message has a tag that matches the
`alt_tag` value, it uses the `alt_key value` as the elasticsearch primary key. You
could specify a field that is shared among the duplicate events to `alt_key`,
which eliminates the duplicate events from the elasticsearch. Sample filter
using `elasticsearch_genid_ext`:
+
----
      @type elasticsearch_genid_ext
      hash_id_key viaq_msg_id
      alt_key kubernetes.event.metadata.uid
      alt_tags "#{ENV['GENID_ALT_TAG'] ||
'kubernetes.var.log.containers.kube-eventrouter-*.** kubernetes.journal.container._default_.kubernetes.event'}"
      </filter>
----
+
With this bug fix, there is no duplicate event logs indexed in elasticsearch.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1641166[*BZ#1641166*])

* The OSB Client Library used by the Service Catalog controller pod was not
closing and freeing TCP connections used to communicate with brokers. Over a
period of time, many TCP connections would remain open and, eventually, the
communication between the Service Catalog controller and brokers would fail.
Additionally, the pod would become unresponsive. Use a new version of the OSB
Client Library, which contains a fix to close connections when finishing a HTTP
request and free idle connections.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1641791[*BZ#1641791*])

* The Automation Broker always created a network policy to give the transient
namespace access to the target namespace. Adding a network policy
to a namespace that does not have any other network policies in place causes the
namespace to be locked down to the newly created policy. Before the network
policy, everything was open and namespaces could communicate with each other.
The Automation Broker now looks to see if there are any network policies in
place for the target namespace. If there are none, the broker will not create a
new network policy. The broker will assume that things are open enough to allow
the transient namespace we create to communicate with the target namespace. The
broker will still create a network policy, giving the transient namespace access
to the target namespace, if there are other network policies in place for the
target namespace. This bug fix allows the broker to perform the APB actions
without affecting existing services running on the target namespace.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1643300[*BZ#1643300*])

* Running `oc logs $fluentd_pod` suggests that you run `oc exec <pod_name>
 /opt/app-root/src/utils/logs`, which includes the non-existing utility logs
 path. Therefore, `oc exec <pod_name> /opt/app-root/src/utils/logs` fails with
 *no such file or directory*. This bug fix updates the suggested command line to
 `oc exec <pod_name> -- logs` since the utility `logs` is now in the *_PATH_*
 and there is no need to specify the full path. As a result, `oc logs
 $fluentd_pod` suggests the correct command line to show the fluentd logs.
 (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1643341[*BZ#1643341*])

 * Unnecessarily short timeout resulted in a failure to reuse artifacts from a
previous build when incremental builds were selected with s2i. This could occur
when the size of the artifacts being reused was particularly large or the host
system was running particularly slowly. Invalid artifacts could be used in a
subsequent build, or artifacts would be recreated instead of reused resulting in
performance degradation. Timeout has been increased to a sufficiently large
value as to avoid this problem. Artifact reuse should no longer timeout.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1644344[*BZ#1644344*])

* When wildcard routes are enabled and namespace ownership checks are disabled,
non-wildcard routes get removed and immediately re-added on the resync interval
boundaries; this causes a brief route outage and results in intermittent errors
on a route. To not remove and re-add the routes on re-sync, interval in the
specific case when wildcard routes enabled and namespace ownership checks are
disabled. Non-wildcard routes continue to serve without any intermittent errors
after the fix.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1647176[*BZ#1647176*])

* Node ConfigMaps are all created by running `create` tasks on the first master.
If the first master has `openshift_use_crio=True`, all ConfigMaps are created
with CRI-O settings because the `node-config` template has CRI-O settings as
part of the template based on that host variable. The CRI-O settings are now
removed from the `node-config` template so that CRI-O settings will only be
added if they are part of the `openshift_node_group` edits. Additionally, the
`bootstrap-node-config` is updated directly if the host is set to
`openshift_use_crio=True`. Node ConfigMaps are now generated correctly based on
`openshift_node_group` edits allowing nodes to be properly configured with CRI-O
settings.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1652191[*BZ#1652191*])

* Installer tasks used the `docker` command to check for container images, which
would fail if Docker was not installed. Docker may not be installed if CRI-O
runtime is specified. The installer tasks would fail when checking container
images. This bug fix updates the installer code to use the container image
management tool based on the container runtime selected. The installer uses the
correct container image management tool based on the selected container runtime
and it now installs successfully.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1652282[*BZ#1652282*])

[[ocp-3-10-83-enhancements]]
==== Enhancements

* One of the tasks of the `openshift-ansible` installer is to include the tuned
role and apply the correct per-node tuning. The tuned role relies on the
"recommend" tuned daemon functionality, which queries *_node-config.yaml_* for
appropriate node labels and sets the correct tuned profile according to these
labels. Unfortunately, with the introduction of the `openshift-node`/`sync`
pods, the node labeling information can be set by the sync pods after the
installer finished and, therefore, OpenShift nodes can run with incorrect tuned
profiles. This enhancement adds a functionality to restart the tuned daemon and,
as a result, set the correct tuned profile when *_node-config.yaml_* changes.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1569917[*BZ#1569917*])

* Liveness and  readiness probes are now added for the Service Catalog API Server
 and Controller Manager. If these pods stop responding, {product-title} will
 restart the pods. Previously, there were no probes to monitor the health of
 Service Catalog.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1647511[*BZ#1647511*])

* Builds that do not explicitly indicate the docker image they consume (by
providing an inline dockerfile or defining the docker strategy's `From` field)
and do not explicitly indicate a pull secret to use, will now use the build's
service account's docker secret by default. Examples of such builds would be a
build that includes a dockerfile in a Git repository. Previously, these builds
would use no secret and potentially fail if the base image was not public. Those
builds will now succeed without the need to either explicitly specify a pull
secret, or explicitly specify the base image in the buildconfig.
