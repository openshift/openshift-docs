== New Features and Enhancements

[[osd-container-orchestration]]
=== Container Orchestration

[[osd-kubernetes-upstream]]
==== Kubernetes Upstream

Many core features announced in March for Kubernetes 1.6 were the result of
OpenShift engineering. Red Hat continues to influence the product in the areas
of storage, networking, resource management, authentication and authorization,
multi-tenancy, security, service deployments and templating, and controller
functionality.

[[osd-project-configmaps-secrets-downward-api-in-same-directory]]
==== Project ConfigMaps, Secrets, and Downward API In the Same Directory

When you mount a memory backed volume into a container, it leverages a
directory. Now, you can place all sources of the configuration for your
application (`configMaps`, secrets, and downward API) into the same directory
path.

The new projected line in the volume definition allows you to tell multiple
volumes to leverage the same mount point while guarding for path collisions.

----
volumes:
  - name: all-in-one
    projected:
      sources:
      - secret:
          name: test-secret
          items:
            - key: data-1
              path: mysecret/my-username
            - key: data-2
              path: mysecret/my-passwd

      - downwardAPI:
          items:
            - path: mydapi/labels
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: metadata.labels
            - path: mydapi/name
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: metadata.name
            - path: mydapi/cpu_limit
              resourceFieldRef:
                containerName: allinone-normal
                resource: limits.cpu
                divisor: "1m"

                - configMap:
                    name: special-config
                    items:
                      - key: special.how
                        path: myconfigmap/shared-config
                      - key: special.type
                        path: myconfigmap/private-config
----

[[osd-init-containers]]
==== Init Containers

You run
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/containers_and_images.adoc#init-containers[init
containers] in the same pod as your application container to create the
environment your application requires or to satisfy any preconditions the
application might have. You can run utilities that you would otherwise need to
place into your application image. You can run them in different file system
namespaces (view of the same file system) and offer them different secrets than
your application container.

Init containers run to completion and each container must finish before the next
one starts. The init containers will honor the restart policy. Leverage
`initContainers` in the `podspec`.

----
$ cat init-containers.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: init-loop
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    volumeMounts:
    - name: workdir
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  initContainers:
  - name: init
    image: centos:centos7
    command:
    - /bin/bash
    - "-c"
    - "while :; do sleep 2; echo hello init container; done"
  volumes:
  - name: workdir
    emptyDir: {}
----

----
$ oc get -f init-containers.yaml
NAME        READY     STATUS     RESTARTS   AGE

----

[[osd-turn-configmap-content-into-environment-variables]]
==== Turn ConfigMap Content into Environment Variables within the Container

Instead of individually declaring environment variables in a pod definition, a
`configMap` can be imported and all of its content can be dynamically turned
into environment variables.

In the pod specification, leverage the `envFrom` object and reference the
desired `configMap`:

----
env:
- name: duplicate_key
  value: FROM_ENV
- name: expansion
  value: $(REPLACE_ME)
envFrom:
- configMapRef:
    name: env-config
----

////
See xref:../dev_guide/configmaps.adoc#dev-guide-configmaps[`ConfigMaps`] for more
information.
////

[[osd-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity]]
==== Pod Affinity and Anti-Affinity

Pod affinity and anti-affinity is helpful if you want to allow Kubernetes the
freedom to select which zone an application lands in, but whichever it chooses
you would like to make sure another component of that application lands in the
same zone.

Another use case is if you have two application components that, due to security
reasons, cannot be on the same physical box. However, you do not want to lock
them into labels on nodes. You want them to land anywhere, but still honor
anti-affinity.

Many of the same high-level concepts mentioned in the node affinity and
anti-affinity hold true here. For pods, you declare a
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity-beta-feature[`topologyKey`],
which will be used as the boundary object for the placement logic.

----

          matchExpressions:
          - key: service

=== Platform Management

[[osd-github-identity-provider-can-optionally-require-a-team]]
==== GitHub Identity Provider Can Optionally Require a Team

Users can now test for GitHub team membership at log in.

There is now a list of one or more GitHub teams to which a user must have
membership in order to authenticate. If specified, only GitHub users that are
members of at least one of the listed teams will be allowed to log in. If this
is not specified, then any person with a valid GitHub account can log in.

=== Developer Experience

[[osd-easier-custom-slave-configuration-for-jenkins]]
==== Easier Custom Slave Configuration for Jenkins

It is now easier to make images available as slave pod templates. Slaves are
defined as image-streams or image-stream tags with the appropriate label. Slaves
can also be specified via a `ConfigMap` with the appropriate label.

////
(Uncomment after OSD 3.6 update finishes)

the Jenkins Kubernetes Plug-in to Run Jobs] for more information.
////

[[osd-detailed-build-timing]]
==== Detailed Build Timing

Builds now record timing information based on more granular steps.

Information such as how long it took to pull the base image, clone the source,
build the source, and push the image are provided. For example:

----
$ oc describe build nodejs-ex-1
Name:        nodejs-ex-1
Namespace:    myproject
Created:    2 minutes ago

Status:            Complete

[[osd-pulling-artifacts-from-remote-resources]]
==== Pulling Artifacts from Remote Resources

Previously, `oc start-build` only allowed a local file to be specified, but did
not allow a URL to a remote resource. Now, users can pull in artifacts
via `oc start-build --from-file=<some URL>`.

This feature only works against GET-based endpoints that do not require
authentication and use either no transport layer security (TLS), or TLS with a
certificate trusted by the client. This feature does not reinvent `curl`. The
file is downloaded by the CLI, then uploaded to the binary build endpoint.

[[osd-setting-env-vars-when-creating-an-app-from-template]]
==== Setting Environment Variables When Creating an Application from a Template

Users now also have the ability to set environment variable when creating an
object (for example, an application) from a template. Previously, this was a
separate step following template creation.

[[osd-support-for-p-parameter-values]]
==== Support for -p Parameter Values

Both `oc new-app` and `oc process` now support `-p` for parameter values. The
`-v` flag is deprecated.

[[osd-ci-cd-pipeline]]
==== CI/CD Pipeline

Enablement materials regarding use of CI/CD pipelines with {product-title} are
now improved. The complexity and number of pipeline samples provided is
increased.

Support is added to `oc new-app` and `oc new-build` so that the commands are
pipeline aware.

[[osd-image-stream-details]]
==== Image Stream Details

Additional details are provided about image streams and their tags. This feature
leverages Cockpit views from image streams. It details tags and provide
information about each.

image::ocp36-image-stream-details.png[bind in context]

[[osd-better-messages-for-syntax-errors]]
==== Better Messages for Syntax Errors in JSON and YAML Files

Better messages for syntax errors in JSON and YAML files are now provided. This
includes details of the syntax problem and the line number containing the issue.

This feature validates input on commands such as `oc create -f foo.json` and
`oc new-app -f template.yaml`. For example:

----
$ oc create -f dc.json
error: json: line 27: invalid character 'y' looking for beginning of value
----

[[osd-cascading-deletes]]
==== Cascading Deletes

When deleting a resource, this feature ensures that all generated or dependent
resources are also deleted.

For example, when selecting a deployment configuration and deleting will delete
the deployment configuration, deployment history, and any running pods.

image::ocp36-cascading-deletes.png[cascading deletes]

[[osd-other-user-interface-changes]]
==== Other User Interface Changes

- Pod details now should show information about
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/containers_and_images.adoc#init-containers[init
containers].
- You can now add or edit environment variables that are populated by data in
secrets or configuration maps.
- You can now create cluster-wide resources from JSON and YAML files.
- There is now an alignment of notification designs.

[[osd-web-console-added-service-details]]
==== Added Service Details

There are now added service details on configuration, traffic, routes, and pods.

There is a new section highlighting routes, service and target ports, host name,
and TLS. There is also a section iterating pods and their status.

[[osd-web-console-configmap-create-list-detail]]
==== ConfigMap: Create, List, Detail

There is now the ability to easily work with configuration data decoupled from
the container image. You can:

* Create new `ConfigMap`
* List out existing `ConfigMaps`
* Work with the configuration details.
* Easily consume them from various other pages.
