== New Features and Enhancements

[[osd-dedicated-admin-updates]]
=== Dedicated Administrator Updates

[[osd-service-accounts]]
==== Service Accounts
As of {product-title} on 3.7, a reserved project called *dedicated-admin* will be created and maintained on each cluster. Any service account created within this project will have *dedicated-admin* permissions by default. Only *dedicated-admin* users will be able to manage service accounts within this project.

[[osd-oauthclientauthorizations]]
==== Oauthclientauthorizations
As of {product-title} on 3.7, *dedicated-admin* users will be able to list and delete `oauthclientauthorizations`.

[[osd-scheduler-statistics]]
==== Scheduler statistics
As of {product-title} on 3.7, *dedicated-admin* users will be able to access scheduler statistics for each node by using the `oc describe node` command.

[[osd-container-orchestration]]
=== Container Orchestration

[[osd-kubernetes-upstream]]
==== Kubernetes Upstream

Many core features Google announced in June for Kubernetes 1.7 were the result
of OpenShift engineering. Red Hat continues to influence the product in the
areas of storage, networking, resource management, authentication and
authorization, multi-tenancy, security, service deployments, templating, and
controller functionality.

[[osd-security]]
=== Security

[[osd-documented-private-public-key-configurations-and-crypto-levels]]
==== Documented Private and Public Key Configurations and Crypto Levels

While {product-title} is a secured by default implementation of Kubernetes,
there is now documentation on what security protocols and ciphers are used.

{product-title} leverages Transport Layer Security (TLS) cipher suites, JSON Web
Algorithms (JWA) crypto algorithms, and offers external libraries such as The
Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSSAPI) and libgpgme.

link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/architecture/index.html#arch-index-how-is-it-secured-tls[Private and public key configurations and Crypto levels] are now documented for {product-title}.

[[osd-node-authorizer-node-restriction-admission-plug-in]]
==== Node Authorizer and Node Restriction Admission Plug-in

Pods can no longer try to gain information from secrets, configuration maps, PV,
PVC, or API objects from other nodes.

link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/node/[Node authorizer]
governs what APIs a kubelet can perform. Spanning read-, write-, and auth-related
operations. In order for the admission controller to know the identity of the
node to enforce the rules, nodes are provisioned with credentials that identify
them with the user name `system:node:<nodename>` and group `system:nodes`.

[[osd-networking]]
=== Networking

[[osd-network-policy]]
==== Network Policy
Network Policy is now fully supported in {product-title} using 3.7.

Network Policy is an optional plug-in specification of how selections of pods
are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints. It
provides fine-grained network namespace isolation using labels and port
specifications.

After installing the Network Policy plug-in, an annotation that flips the
namespace from `allow all traffic` to `deny all traffic` must first be set on
the namespace. At that point, `NetworkPolicies` can be created that define what
traffic to allow. The annotation is as follows:

----
$ oc annotate namespace ${ns} 'net.beta.kubernetes.io/network-policy={"ingress":{"isolation":"DefaultDeny"}}'
----

[NOTE]
====
The annotation is not needed when using the v1 API.
====

The allow-to-red policy specifies "all red pods in namespace `project-a` allow
traffic from any pods in any namespace." This does not apply to the red pod in
namespace `project-b` because `podSelector` only applies to the namespace in
which it was applied.

.Policy applied to project
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: allow-to-red
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      type: red
  ingress:
  - {}
----

See
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/admin_guide/managing_networking.html#admin-guide-networking-networkpolicy[Managing Networking] for more information.

[[osd-hsts-policy-support]]
==== HSTS Policy Support

link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/architecture/networking/routes.html#route-specific-annotations[HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)] ensures all communication between the server and client is encrypted and
that all sent and received responses are delivered to and received from the
authenticated server.

An HSTS policy is provided to the client via an HTTPS header (HSTS headers over
HTTP are ignored) using an `haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header` annotation
to the route. When the Strict-Transport-Security response in the header is
received by a client, it observes the policy until it is updated by another
response from the host, or it times-out (`max-age=0`).

Example using reencrypt route:

. Create the pod/svc/route:
+
----
$ oc create -f https://example.com/test.yaml
----

. Set the Strict-Transport-Security header:
+
----
$ oc annotate route serving-cert haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header="max-age=300;includeSubDomains;preload"
----

. Access the route using `https`:
+
----
$ curl --head https://$route -k

   ...
   Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=300;includeSubDomains;preload
   ...
----

[[osd-developer-experience]]
=== Developer Experience

[[osd-template-instantation-api]]
==== Template Instantiation API

Clients can now easily invoke a server API instead of relying on client logic.

See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/rest_api/examples.html#template-instantiation[Template Instantiation] for more information.

[[osd-chaining-builds]]
==== Chaining Builds

In {product-title} on 3.7,
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/dev_guide/builds/advanced_build_operations.html#dev-guide-chaining-builds[Chaining Builds] is a better approach for producing runtime-only application images, and
fully replaces the Extended Builds feature.

Benefits of Chaining Builds include:

* Supported by both Docker and Source-to-Image (S2I) build strategies, as well as
combinations of the two, compared with S2I strategy only for Extended Builds.

* No need to create and manage a new assemble-runtime script.

* Easy to layer application components into any thin runtime-specific image.

* Can build the application artifacts image anywhere.

* Better separation of concerns between the step that produces the application
artifacts and the step that puts them into an application image.

[[osd-web-console]]
=== Web Console

[[osd-initial-experience]]
==== Initial Experience

{product-title} on 3.7 provides a better initial user experience with the Service
Catalog. This includes:

* A task-focused interface
* Key call-outs
* Unified search
* Streamlined navigation

The new user interface is designed to really streamline the getting started
process, in addition to incorporating the new Service Catalog items. These Service Catalog items are not yet available in OpenShift Dedicated.

[[osd-search-catalog]]
==== Search Catalog

{product-title} on 3.7 provides a simple way to quickly get what you want The new
Search Catalog user interface is designed to make it much easier to find items
in a number of ways, making it even faster to find the items you are wanting to
deploy.

image::3.7-search-filter-catalog.gif[search catalog]

[[osd-add-from-catalog]]
==== Add from Catalog

Provision a service from the catalog. Select the desired service and follow
prompts for the desired project and configuration details.

image::3.7-add-to-project-wizard-animated.gif[add to project]

[[osd-connect-a-service]]
==== Connect a Service
Once a service is deployed, get coordinates to connect the application to it.

The broker returns a secret, which is stored in the project for use. You are
guided through a process to update the deployment to inject a secret.

image::3.7-bind-mongodb-nodejs-at-creation.gif[connect a service]

[[osd-include-templates-from-other-projects]]
==== Include Templates from Other Projects

Since templates are now served through a broker, there is now a way for you to
deploy templates from other projects.

Upload the template, then select the template from a project.

image::3.7-add-to-project-options.png[Add to Project Options]

[[osd-notifications]]
==== Notifications
Key notifications are now under a single UI element, the notification drawer.

The bell icon is decorated when new notifications exist. You can mark all read,
clear all, view all, or dismiss individual ones. Key notifications are
represented with the level of information, warning, or error.

image::3.7-notification-drawer.png[Notification drawer]

[[ocp-37-improved-quota-warnings]]
==== Improved Quota Warnings
Quota notifications are now put in the notification drawer and are less intrusive.

image::37-quota-warning.png[quota warning]

There are now separate notifications for each quota type instead of one generic
warning. When at quota and not over quota, this is displayed as an informative
message. Usage and maximum is displayed in the message. You can mark *Don't Show
Me Again* per quota type. Administrators can create custom messages to the quota
warning.

[[osd-support-for-envfrom]]
==== Support for the EnvFrom Construct

Anything with a pod template now supports the `EnvFrom` construct that lets you
break down an entire configuration map or secret into environment variables without
explicitly setting `env name` to  `key mappings`.
