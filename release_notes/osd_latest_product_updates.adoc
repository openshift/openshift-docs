[[osd-new-features-and-enhancements]]
== New Features and Enhancements

[[osd-cluster-infrastructure]]
=== Cluster Infrastructure

[[osd-quota-pvc-storage-requests]]
==== Quota on Persistent Volume Claim Storage Requests

With dynamic storage provisioning enabled, cluster administrators needed to be
able to set quota on the amount of storage a project can request. Cluster
administrators can now do so by setting the `requests.storage` value for user's
projects:

----
$ oc create quota my-quota -n my-project \
    --hard=requests.storage=10Gi,persistentvolumeclaims=50

$ oc describe quota
Name:                     my-quota
Namespace:                my-project
Resource                  Used    Hard
--------                  ----    ----
persistentvolumeclaims    1       50
requests.storage          10Gi    2Gi
----

See xref:../admin_guide/quota.adoc#managed-by-quota[Setting Quotas] for more
details.

[[osd-integrated-metrics]]
==== Metrics
{product-title} now includes integrated Hawkular metrics as part of the Base Cluster. This integration allows visibility into memory, CPU, and network usage for each pod.

This metrics integration includes:

.  xref:osd-usability-project-overview[Project Overview] Integration
.  Metrics tab for specific pods and deployments (*Applications* -> *Pods* -> specific pod -> *Metrics*)
.  xref:ocp33-web-console-monitoring[Monitoring Tab] Integration
.  Read-only Hawkular Metrics API access via metrics URL specific to each cluster

Having metrics installed on the cluster also enables the xref:osd-web-console-ab-routing[A/B Routing] feature.

[[osd-integrated-logging]]
==== Logging
{product-title} now includes integrated logging, using an EFK stack, as part of the Base Cluster.

This logging integration includes:

.  Logging tab for specific Pods (*Applications* -> *Pods* -> specific pod -> *Logs*)
.  xref:ocp33-web-console-monitoring[Monitoring Tab] Integration
.  Access to aggregate or historical data using a Kibana URL specific to each cluster (also available via *View archive* link on *Logging* tab)

[[osd-enterprise-container-registry]]
=== Enterprise Container Registry

This release adds the following improvements to the registry and its user
experience.

[[osd-image-layout-view]]
==== Image Layout View

A new image layout view has been added to the {product-title} web console,
providing additional information about specific images in the {product-title}
registry by clicking on their tags from the *Builds* -> *Images* page.

.Details Tab
image::ocp34-image-layout1.png[Details Tab]

.Layers Tab
image::ocp34-image-layout2.png[Layers Tab]

[[osd-support-additional-slashes-image-tag-names]]
==== Support Additional Slashes in Image Tag Names

You can now use external docker distribution servers that support images with more than two path segments. For example:

----
exampleregistry.net/project/subheading/image:tag
----

{product-title}, however, is still limited to images of the form
`$namespace/$name`, and cannot create multi-segment images.

[[osd-registry-user-interface]]
==== Registry User Interface

{product-title} provides a registry to manage container images. The most
noticeable improvements to the registry are in the user interface.

[discrete]
[[osd-integrated-registry-ui]]
===== Integrated Registry User Interface

The updated {product-title} integrated registry provides details about the
container images it manages and their tagged versions from within the
{product-title} web console. Each tag of an image stream, from the *Builds →
Images* view, is now a hyperlink that leads to a multi-tabbed page with more
information about the selected image.

.Integrated Registry User Interface
image::ocp33-integrated-registry-ui.png["Integrated Registry User Interface]

The *Details* tab shows the image author, built-on date, digest hash ID, labels,
annotations, and docker version for compatibility comparisons. The *Config* tab
shows how the container image was built and its set of defined metadata labels.
The *Layers* tab shows the size and digest ID for each layer of the image.

.Integrated Registry User Interface: Details Tab
image::ocp33-integrated-registry-ui-2.png["Integrated Registry User Interface: Details Tab"]

[[osd-unauthenticated-image-pull]]
==== Unauthenticated Image Pull (Anonymous Access)

This new feature provides the ability to pull images from the {product-title}
integrated registry without a docker login, to facilitate automation and users
who want the ability to simply pull an image.

To enable this, the project administrator (a user with the *registry-admin*
role) can assign the *registry-viewer* role with the following command:

----
$ oc policy add-role-to-group registry-viewer system:unauthenticated
----

[[osd-support-docker-distribution-2-4]]
==== Support for docker distribution 2.4

The {product-title} registry provides support for docker distribution
registry 2.4, and the features will be backported to {product-title} 3.2.
Version 2.4 of the registry includes a variety of performance and usability
enhancements, notably:

[discrete]
[[osd-relnotes-cross-repo-mounting]]
===== Cross-repo Mounting When Pushing Images That Already Exist in the Registry

When a client wishes to push a blob to a target repository from a primary
source, and knows that the blob already exists in a secondary source repository
on the same server as the target, this feature gives the user the ability to
optimize the push by requesting the server cross-mount the blob from the
secondary source repository, speeding up push time.

Of course, the client must have proper authorizations (pull and push on the
target repository, pull on the secondary source repository). If the client is
not authorized to pull from the secondary source repository, the blob push will
proceed, unoptimized, and the client will push the entire blob to the target
repository from the primary source repository without assistance from the
secondary source repository.

[discrete]
[[osd-relnotes-support-new-schema2]]
===== Support for the New schema2 Storage Format for Images

The image manifest version 2, schema2, allows multi-architecture images via a
manifest list which references image manifests for one or more platform-specific
versions of an image (e.g., `amd64` versus `ppc64le`). Schema 2 also supports
the ability to hash an image's configuration, to create an ID for the image and
provide docker content-addressable information about the image.

[[osd-allow-image-pull-through]]
==== Allow Image "Pull-Through" from a Remote Registry

The {product-title} integrated registry allows remote public and private images
to be tagged into an image stream and "pulled-through" it, as if the image were
already pushed to the {product-title} registry. Authentication credentials
required for private images to create the image stream are re-used by the
integrated registry for subsequent pull-through requests to the remote registry.

The content-offload optimization configuration is still honored by pull-through
requests. If the pull-through request points to a remote registry configured
with both a storage back end (for example, GCS, S3, or Swift storage) and
content-offload enabled, a redirect URL that points directly to the blobs on the
remote back end storage will be passed through the local registry to the local
docker daemon, creating a direct connection to the remote storage for the blobs.

To optimize image and blob lookups for pull-through requests, a small cache is
kept in the registry to track which image streams have the manifest for the
requested blobs, avoiding a potentially costly multi-server search.

[[osd-developer-experience]]
=== Developer Experience

This release adds the following improvements to the developer workflow when
developing and testing applications on {product-title}.

[osd-pipelines]]
==== OpenShift Pipelines Fully Supported

OpenShift Pipelines, introduced in {product-title} 3.3 as a
Technology Preview feature, are now fully
supported. OpenShift Pipelines are based on the
link:https://jenkins.io/solutions/pipeline/[Jenkins Pipeline plug-in]. By
integrating Jenkins Pipelines, you can now leverage the full power and
flexibility of the Jenkins ecosystem while managing your workflow from within
{product-title}.

See the following for more on pipelines:

- xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#pipeline-build[Pipeline Concept]
- link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.4/install_config/configuring_pipeline_execution.html#install-config-configuring-pipeline-execution[Configuring Pipeline Execution]
- xref:../dev_guide/builds.adoc#pipeline-strategy-options[Pipeline Strategy Option]

[[osd-jenkins-20-image]]
==== Jenkins 2.0 Image

{product-title} users using integrated Jenkins CI and CD pipelines can now
leverage Jenkins 2.0 with improved usability and other enhancements.

[[osd-jenkins-oauth-login]]
==== Automatically Log in to Integrated Jenkins Using OAuth

Users who deploy an {product-title} integrated Jenkins server can now configure
it to allow automatic logins from the web console based on an OAuth flow with
the master instead of requiring the standard Jenkins authentication credentials.

See
xref:../using_images/other_images/jenkins.html#jenkins-openshift-oauth-authentication[{product-title}
OAuth Authentication] for configuration details.

[[osd-development-cluster-setup]]
==== Easy and Quick Development Cluster Setup

Often a developer will want to have a stand-alone {product-title} instance
running on their desktop to enable evaluation of various features or developer
and testing locally of their containerized applications containers. Launching a
local instance of {product-title} for application development is now as easy as
downloading the latest client tools and running:

----
$ oc cluster up
----

This provides a running cluster using your local *docker* daemon or Docker
Machine. All the basic infrastructure of the cluster is automatically configured
for you: a registry, router, image streams for standard images, and sample
templates.

It also creates a normal user and system administrator accounts for managing the
cluster.

[[osd-serialized-build-execution]]
==== Serialized Build Execution

Prior to the latest update, if multiple builds were created for a given build
configuration, they all ran in parallel. This resulted in a race to the finish,
with the last build to push an application image to the registry winning. This
also lead to higher resource utilization peaks when multiple builds ran at the
same time.

Now in {product-title}, builds run serially by default. It is still
possible to revert to the parallel build policy if desired. In addition, the new
`*SerialLatestOnly*` policy runs builds in serial, but skips intermediary
builds. In other words, if build 1 is running and builds 2, 3, 4, and 5 are in
the queue, when build 1 completes the system will cancel builds 2 through 4 and
immediately run build 5. This allows you to optimize your build system around
building the latest code and not waste time building intermediate commits.

For more information, see xref:../dev_guide/builds/build_run_policy.adoc#dev-guide-build-run-policy[Build Run Policy].


[[osd-enhancement-source-code-synchronization]]
==== Enhanced Source Code Synchronization

The `oc rsync` command was added previously, allowing synchronizing of a local
file system to a running container. This is a very useful tool for copying files
into a container in general, but in particular it can be used to synchronize
local source code into a running application framework. For frameworks that
support hot deployment when files change, this enables an extremely responsive
"code -> save -> debug" workflow with source on the developer's machine using the their
IDE of choice, while the application runs in the cloud with access to any
service it depends on, such as databases.

This sync flow is made even easier with this release by coupling it with a file
system watch. Instead of manually syncing changes, developers can now run `oc
rsync --watch`, which launches a long running process that monitors the local
file system for changes and continuously syncs them to the target container.
Assuming the target container is running a framework that supports hot reload of
source code, the development workflow is now: "save file in IDE -> reload
application page in browser -> see changes."

For more information, see xref:../dev_guide/copy_files_to_container.adoc#continuous-syncing-on-file-change[Continuous Syncing on File Change].

[[osd-build-trigger-cause-tracking]]
==== Build Trigger Cause Tracking

While {product-title} has always automatically run a build of your application
when source changes or an upstream image that your application is built on top
of has been updated, prior to the update it was not easy to know why
your application had been rebuilt.  With the latest update, builds now include
information explaining what triggered the build (manual, image change, webhook,
etc.) as well as details about the change, such as the image or commit ID
associated with the change.

[discrete]
[[osd-relnotes-triggered-image-change]]
===== A Build Triggered by an Image Change

Output provided by CLI command `oc describe build`:

----

Then, within the web console:

.Build Triggered by Webhook
image::ocp33-triggered-by-webhook.png["Build Triggered by Webhook"]

[[osd-webhook-improvements]]
==== Webhook Improvements

It is now possible to provide additional inputs to webhook triggered builds. Previously, the generic webhook simply started a new build with all the default values inherited from the build configuration. It is now possible to provide a payload to the webhook API.

The payload can provide Git information so that a specific commit or branch can
be built. Environment variables can also be provided in the payload. Those
environment variables are made available to the build in the same way as
environment variables defined in the build configuration.

For examples of how to define a payload and invoke the webhook, see xref:../dev_guide/builds/triggering_builds.adoc#generic-webhooks[Generic Webhooks].

[[osd-self-tuning-images]]
==== Self-tuning Images

{product-title} provides a number of framework images for working with Java,
Ruby, PHP, Python, NodeJS, and Perl code. It also provides a few database images
(MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL) out of the box. For the latest release of {product-title}, these images are improved by making them self-tuning.

Based on the container memory limits specified when the images are deployed,
these images will automatically configure parameters like heap sizes, cache
sizes, number of worker threads, and more. All these automatically-tuned values
can easily be overridden by environment variables, as well.

[[osd-web-console]]
=== Web Console

This release adds the following improvements to the web console, including
updates to existing features, usability overhauls, and a few brand new concepts.

[[osd-filter-sort-projects-list]]
==== Filtering and Sorting the Projects List

To make navigation easier for users interacting with large numbers of projects,
the *Projects* page now has a text filter by name, display name, description,
and project creator. It also allows sorting on several of these attributes.

.Filtering and Sorting Projects
image::ocp34-filtering-sorting-projects.gif[Filtering and Sorting Projects]

[[osd-catalog-categories-org]]
==== Better Catalog Organization and Customizable Categories

The existing *Add to project* catalogy could become cluttered when dealing with
builder images with many versions or many templates with slight differences.
Previously, the focus was minimizing the number of clicks to get an application
running, however the updated layout now focuses on helping you find what you are
actually looking for.

The main catalog page now only contains high-level categories *Languages* and
*Technologies*, and underneath those are subcategories, such as *Java* and *Data
Stores*. Clicking one of those shows redesigned tiles for build images and
templates. Different versions of the same builder image now all roll-up into the
same tile with the semantically `latest` version automatically selected.

All of the default image streams and templates have also now been updated with
better display names, descriptions, and categorization.

.Catalog Organization
image::ocp34-catalog-categories-org.gif[New Catalog Organization]

If you do not like the default categories and subcategories, you can also now
customize those as well. See
xref:../install_config/web_console_customization.adoc#configuring-catalog-categories[Configuring
Catalog Categories] for more details.

[[osd-secrets-bc-dc]]
==== Creating and Adding Secrets for Build and Deployment Configurations

It was previously difficult to set up a build against a private Git repository
from the web console. You had to import YAML or JSON to create your secret, then
edit your build's YAML to make it use that secret.

You can now expand the advanced build options, create a user and password or SSH
key-based secret, then specify that the build use that when cloning your source.
If you already have your secret created in the project, you can also choose any
of the existing ones.

.Secrets in Web Console
image::ocp34-secrets-bc-dc.gif[Secrets in Web Console]

Setting up push and pull against private image registries has also been
improved. The build configuration editor now allows you to set up a push or pull
secret in case the image you are building from, or the image stream you are
pushing to, is in a secure registry. Similarly, the new deployment configuration
editor allows you to specify a pull secret.

[[osd-editing-dc]]
==== Editing Deployment Configuration Strategy, Hooks, and Secrets

A deployment configuration editor has been added to the web console, similar to the existing build configuration editor. With this new editor, you can:

- Switch your deployment strategy
- Modify advanced deployment settings like the maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during the deployment
- Add, edit, or remove deployment lifecycle hooks
- Change the image being deployed
- Set a pull secret for the registry your image is being pull from
- Add, edit, or remove environment variables for the pods that will be deployed

.Deployment Configuration Editor
image::ocp34-dc-editor.gif[Deployment Configuration Editor]

Many of the existing editing actions still exist as separate actions, such as
editing health checks, or configuring different resource limits. If you want to
make a number of changes without triggering a deployment for each change, you
can now pause your deployment, make all the changes you want, and then resume
it. Pausing prevents any deployment from happening, no matter whether it was
automatically or manually triggered.

[[osd-quota-warnings]]
==== Quota Warnings

Users working within quota constraints had a hard time knowing when they had run
out of quota, unless they went to check the *Quota* page. To address this,
checks have been added for the most common scenarios where people have problems
with quota. You now get quota warnings:

- On the *Overview* as a generic warning if anything in your quota is at its
limit.
- On the *Overview* pod count visualizations when you are unable to reach your
scale target due to quota.
- If you try to create something and you are out of quota for that resource.
- If you try to create something and it will cause you to exceed quota for a
resource.

.Quota Warnings
image::ocp34-quota-warnings1.png[Quota Warnings]

.Quota Warnings
image::ocp34-quota-warnings2.png[Quota Warnings]

[[osd-managing-project-membership]]
==== Managing Project Membership

An important feature for users that want to collaborate with the same projects,
the new membership management interface allows you to add and remove roles to
users, groups, and service accounts within your project.

.Managing Project Membership
image::ocp34-managing-project-membership.gif[Managing Project Membership]

Project administrators have access to view and modify the project's membership.
Membership management is the only difference between an administrator and an
editor in the default {product-title} roles. Cluster administrators can add a
description to any role to provide extra information for end users about what
that role actually allows.

[[osd-bookmarkable-page-states]]
==== Bookmarkable Page States

Tab selection, label filters, and several other options that change page state
are now persisted to the URL throughout the web console. This allows you to
bookmark specific pages and share with others.

[[osd-new-kubernetes-web-console]]
==== Support for New Kubernetes Features

Support for the following new Kubernetes features have been added to the web
console:

* Create storage using storage classes
** If your cluster administrator sets up storage classes, they will be available
for you to pick from in the *Create Storage* page.
* xref:../dev_guide/deployments/kubernetes_deployments.adoc#dev-guide-kubernetes-deployments-support[`Deployments` and `ReplicaSets`]
** Fit in seamlessly on the *Overview* page alongside your existing deployment
configurations.
** Appear on the *Applications* -> *Deployments* page.
** Support many of the actions already supported for deployment configurations
(excluding the new editor).
* Roll-up of `PetSet` pods on the *Overview* page
** Pods for a `PetSet` roll up into a single card with a pod count visualization
like the other controllers.
** Metrics viewable on the overview for the pods in the `PetSet`.


[[osd-usability-project-overview]]
==== Usability Improvements: Project Overview

The web console's *Overview* is the landing page for your project. At a glance,
you should be able to see what is running in your project, how things are
related, and what state they are in. To that end, the re-designed overview now
includes the following:

.New Project Overview
image::ocp33-project-overview.png["New Project Overview"]
<1> Warnings, suggestions, and other notifications in context
<2> Metrics for a deployment or pod
<3> Better awareness of deployment status (animation of rolling deployments, cancel
in-progress deployments, and wake up idled deployments)
<4> Grouping of related services

[[osd-usability-project-navigation]]
==== Usability Improvements: Project Navigation

Previously, most of the concepts in {product-title} were hidden underneath a
generic *Browse* menu. An exercise to define the information architecture
resulted in the new left sidebar project navigation.

[horizontal]
Overview:: The dashboard for your project.
Applications:: Everything that make up your running application. This means pods, things that create or replicate pods, and anything that controls the flow of network traffic to pods.
Builds:: Builds, pipelines, and build artifacts, like images.
Resources:: Resource restrictions like limit ranges, project quotas, and cluster quotas. Also, other advanced resources in your project that do not fit into one of the top level concepts.
Storage:: View your existing persistent volume claims (PVCs) and request persistent storage.
Monitoring:: A single page that gives you access to logs, metrics, and events.

[[osd-web-console-ab-routing]]
==== New Concept: A/B Routing

In {product-title}, routes can now point to multiple back end services,
commonly called xref:osd-ab-service-annotation[A/B deployments]. Routes
configured in this way will automatically group the related services and
visualize the percentage of traffic configured to go to each one.

.A/B Routes
image::ocp33-abroutes.png["A/B Routes"]

Modifying the route's back end services can be done in the new GUI editor, which
also lets you change the route's target ports, path, and TLS settings.

[[osd-web-console-deploy-image]]
==== Deploy Image

The *Add to Project* page now a *Deploy Image* option. The behavior is similar
to the `oc run` command, allowing you to pick any existing image or tag from an
image stream, or to look for an image using a docker pull spec. After you have
picked an image, it generates the service, deployment configuration, and an
image stream if it is from a pull spec.

.Deploy Image
image::ocp33-deployimage.png["Deploy Image"]

You can also take advantage of the new and improved key value editor for
environment variables and labels.

[[osd-web-console-import-yaml-json]]
==== Import YAML / JSON

The *Add to Project* page now has an *Import YAML / JSON* option, which behaves
like the `oc create -f` command. You can paste, upload, or drag and drop your
file, and even edit the YAML or JSON before submitting it. If your file
contained a template resource, you can choose whether you want to create and/or
process the template resource.

.Import YAML / JSON
image::ocp33-importyamljson.png["Import YAML / JSON"]

Processing a template goes to the existing experience for creating from a
template, and now supports showing a message to the user on the next steps page.
This message can be defined by the template author and can include generated
parameters like passwords and other keys.

[[osd-web-console-other-resources]]
==== Other Resources

The *Other Resources* page gives you access to all the other content that exists
in your project that do not have dedicated pages yet. You can select the type of
resource you want to list and get actions to *Edit YAML* (similar to `oc edit`)
and *Delete*. Due to a new feature that has been applied to the whole web
console, only the resource types you have permission to list are shown, and only
actions that you can actually perform.

.Other Resources
image::ocp33-otherresources.png["Other Resources"]

[[ocp33-web-console-monitoring]]
==== Monitoring

While the *Overview* provides some simple metrics and pod status, the new
*Monitoring* page provides a deeper dive into the logs, metrics, and events
happening in your project.

.Monitoring
image::ocp33-monitoring.png["Monitoring"]


[[ocp33-web-console-debugging]]
==== Debugging

When a pod's containers are not starting cleanly, a link is now shown on the pod
details page to debug it in a terminal. This starts a pod with identical
settings, but changes the container's entrypoint to `/bin/sh` instead, giving
you access to the runtime environment of the container.

.Debugging
image::ocp33-debugging.png["Debugging"]

A number of small improvements to the container terminal have also been added
that create a smoother experience, including:

- Automatically focusing the keyboard input when the terminal connection is established
- Resizing based on the available space in the browser window
- Setting the `*TERM*` environment variable so common shell actions like `clear` behave the way you expect
- Better support for multi-container pods

.Terminal
image::ocp33-terminal.png["Terminal"]

[[osd-web-console-image-details]]
==== Image Details

Before the latest update, there was no information in the web console about
the images in your image streams, aside from the SHAs. This made it difficult to
know the specifics of how your image was defined unless you used the CLI. Now,
for any image stream tag you can see the metadata, cofiguration, and layers.

.Image Stream Tag Details
image::ocp33-imagedetails.png["Image Stream Tag Details"]

.Image Stream Tag Configuration
image::ocp33-imagedetails2.png["Image Stream Tag Configuration"]

[[osd-networking]]
=== Networking

This release adds the following improvements to networking components.

[[osd-subdomain-wildcard-router]]
==== Subdomain Wildcard Router

Users can now use wildcard routes to determine the destination of all traffic
for a domain and its subdomains. For example, `*.foo.com` can be routed to the
same back-end service, which is configured to handle all the subdomains.

You can specify that a route allows wildcard support through an annotation, and
the HAProxy router exposes the route to the service per the route's wildcard
policy. The most-specific path wins; for example, `bar.foo.com` is matched
before `foo.com`.

See xref:../dev_guide/getting_traffic_into_cluster.adoc#using-a-router[Getting Traffic Into the Cluster] and xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#wildcard-subdomain-route-policy[Creating Routes Specifying a Wildcard Subdomain Policy] for more details.

[[osd-ab-service-annotation]]
==== A/B Service Annotation

The latest update adds service lists to routes, making it easier to perform
A/B testing. Each route can now have multiple services assigned to it, and those
services can come from different applications or pods.

New automation enables HAProxy to be able to read weight annotations on the
route for the services. This enables developers to declare traffic flow (for
example, 70% to application A and 30% to application B) using the CLI or web
console.

[[osd-security]]
=== Security

This release adds the following improvements to cluster security.

[[osd-scc-profiles-seccomp]]
==== SCC Profiles for seccomp

The *seccomp* feature in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) has been enabled for docker 1.10 or higher. This feature allows containers to define interactions with the kernel using *syscall* filtering. This reduces the risk of a malicious container exploiting a kernel vulnerability, thereby reducing the guest attack surface.

{product-title} adds the ability to create *seccomp* policies with security
context constraints (SCCs). This allows Red Hat Operations to set SCC
policies on developers that imposes a filter on their containers for Linux-level
system calls.

See the xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#authorization-seccomp[Authorization] concept for more details.

[[osd-cluster-longevity]]
=== Cluster Longevity

This release adds the following improvements to cluster longevity.

[[osd-scale]]
==== Scale

1000 nodes per cluster at 250 pods per node (with a
recommendation of 10 pods per hyper-threaded core) are now supported. See the OpenShift Container Platform
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.4/install_config/install/planning.html#sizing[Sizing Considerations] for
more details.
