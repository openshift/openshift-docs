[id="ocp-4-14-new-features-and-enhancements"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

[id="ocp-4-14-rhcos"]
=== {op-system-first}


[id="ocp-4-14-installation-and-update"]
=== Installation and update

[id="ocp-4-14-user-defined-tags-azure"]
==== User-defined tags for Microsoft Azure is now generally available

User-defined tags for Microsoft Azure was previously introduced as Technology Preview in {product-title} 4.13 and is now generally available in {product-title} 4.14. For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-customizations.adoc#installing-azure-user-defined-tags_installing-azure-customizations[Configuring the user-defined tags for Azure].

[id="ocp-4-14-aws-security-groups"]
==== Applying existing AWS security groups to a cluster

By default, the installation program creates and attaches security groups to control plane and compute machines. The rules associated with the default security groups cannot be modified.

With {product-title} {product-version}, if you deploy a cluster to an existing Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), you can apply additional existing AWS security groups to control plane and compute machines. These security groups must be associated with the VPC that you are deploying the cluster to. Applying custom security groups can help you meet the security needs of your organization, in such cases where you must control the incoming or outgoing traffic of these machines.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-vpc.adoc#installation-aws-vpc-security-groups_installing-aws-vpc[Applying existing AWS security groups to the cluster].

[id="ocp-4-14-admin-ack-updating"]
==== Required administrator acknowledgment when updating from {product-title} 4.13 to 4.14

{product-title} 4.14 uses Kubernetes 1.27, which removed a xref:../release_notes/ocp-4-14-release-notes.adoc#ocp-4-14-removed-kube-1-27-apis[deprecated API].

A cluster administrator must provide a manual acknowledgment before the cluster can be updated from {product-title} 4.13 to 4.14. This is to help prevent issues after updating to {product-title} 4.14, where APIs that have been removed are still in use by workloads, tools, or other components running on or interacting with the cluster. Administrators must evaluate their cluster for any APIs in use that will be removed and migrate the affected components to use the appropriate new API version. After this is done, the administrator can provide the administrator acknowledgment.

All {product-title} 4.13 clusters require this administrator acknowledgment before they can be updated to {product-title} 4.14.

For more information, see xref:../updating/preparing_for_updates/updating-cluster-prepare.adoc#updating-cluster-prepare[Preparing to update to {product-title} 4.14].

[id="ocp-4-14-nutanix-three-node"]
==== Three-node cluster support for Nutanix
Deploying a three-node cluster is supported on Nutanix as of {product-title} {product-version}. This type of {product-title} cluster is a more resource efficient cluster. It consists of only three control plane machines, which also act as compute machines.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_nutanix/installing-nutanix-three-node.adoc#installing-nutanix-three-node[Installing a three-node cluster on Nutanix].

[id="oc-mirror-multi-arch-oci-local-images"]
==== Supporting multi-arch OCI local images for catalogs with oc-mirror

With {product-title} {product-version}, oc-mirror supports multi-arch OCI local images for catalogs.

OCI layouts consist of an `index.json` file that identifies the images held within them on disk. This `index.json` file can reference any number of single or multi-arch images. However, oc-mirror only references a single image at a time in a given OCI layout. The image stored in the OCI layout can be a single-arch image, that is, an image manifest or a multi-arch image, that is, a manifest list.

The `ImageSetConfiguration` stores the OCI images. After processing the catalog, the catalog content adds new layers representing the content of all images in the layout. The ImageBuilder is modified to handle image updates for both single-arch and multi-arch images.

[id="oc-logging-in-browser"]
==== Logging in to the CLI using a web browser

With {product-title} {product-version}, a new `oc` command-line interface (CLI) flag, `--web` is now available for the `oc login` command.

With this enhancement, you can log in using a web browser, which allows you to avoid inserting your access token into the command line.

For more information, see xref:../cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.adoc#cli-logging-in-web_cli-developer-commands[Logging in to the OpenShift CLI using a web browser].

[id="oc-new-build-enhancement"]
==== Enhancement to oc new-build

A new oc command line interface (CLI) flag, `--import-mode`, has been added to the `oc new-build` command. With this enhancement, users can set the `--import-mode` flag to `Legacy` or `PreserverOriginal`, which provides users the option to trigger builds using a single sub-manifest, or all manifests, respectively.

[id="oc-new-app-enhancement"]
==== Enhancement to oc new-app

A new oc command line interface (CLI) flag, `--import-mode`, has been added to the `oc new-app` command. With this enhancement, users can set the `--import-mode` flag to `Legacy` or `PreserverOriginal`, which provides users the option to create new applications using a single sub-manifest, or all manifests, respectively.

[id="ocp-4-14-ingress-node-firewall-operator-ga"]
==== Ingress Node Firewall Operator is generally available
Ingress Node Firewall Operator was made a technology preview in {product-title} 4.12. With this release, Ingress Node Firewall Operator is generally available. You can now configure firewall rules at the node level. For more information, see xref:../networking/networking-operators-overview.adoc#networking-operators-overview[Ingress Node Firewall Operator].

[id="ocp-4-14-networking-kernal-network-pinning"]
==== Dynamic use of non-reserved CPUs for OVS

With this release, the Open vSwitch (OVS) networking stack can dynamically use non-reserved CPUs.
This dynamic use of non-reserved CPUs occurs by default in performance-tuned clusters with a CPU manager policy set to `static`.
The dynamic use of available, non-reserved CPUs maximizes compute resources for OVS and minimizes network latency for workloads during periods of high demand.
OVS remains unable to dynamically use isolated CPUs assigned to containers in `Guaranteed` QoS pods. This separation avoids disruption to critical application workloads.

[NOTE]
====
When the Node Tuning Operator recognizes the performance conditions to activate the use of non-reserved CPUs, there is a several second delay while OVN-Kubernetes configures the CPU affinity alignment of OVS daemons running on the CPUs. During this window, if a `Guaranteed` QoS pod starts, it can experience a latency spike.
====

[id="ocp-4-14-networking-sriov-exclude-topology"]
==== Exclude SR-IOV network topology for NUMA-aware scheduling

With this release, you can exclude advertising the Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) node for the SR-IOV network to the Topology Manager. By not advertising the NUMA node for the SR-IOV network, you can permit more flexible SR-IOV network deployments during NUMA-aware pod scheduling.

For example, in some scenarios, it is a priority to maximize CPU and memory resources for a pod on a single NUMA node. By not providing a hint to the Topology Manager about the NUMA node for the pod’s SR-IOV network resource, the Topology Manager can deploy the SR-IOV network resource and the pod CPU and memory resources to different NUMA nodes. In earlier {product-title} releases, the Topology Manager attempted to place all resources on the same NUMA node only.

For more information about this more flexible SR-IOV network deployment during NUMA-aware pod scheduling, see xref:../networking/hardware_networks/configuring-sriov-device.adoc#nw-sriov-exclude-topology-manager_configuring-sriov-device[Exclude the SR-IOV network topology for NUMA-aware scheduling].

[id="ocp-4-14-networking-haproxy-update"]
==== Update to HAProxy 2.6
With this release, {product-title} updated to HAProxy 2.6.

[id="ocp-4-14-networking-nncp-console"]
==== Managing NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy from the web console
In previous releases, the monitoring and updating of node networking were achieved through the utilization of the NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy object by using the CLI. With this release, you can now administrate the `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` directly from the web console. This page enables you to create, update, view, and delete the policies by using either a user-friendly form or with YAML updates.

For more information, see xref:../networking/k8s_nmstate/k8s-nmstate-updating-node-network-config.adoc##virt-node-network-config-console_k8s_nmstate-updating-node-network-config[Managing NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy from the web console].

[id="ocp-4-14-descheduler-resource-limits"]
==== Descheduler resource limits for large clusters

With this release, the resource limits for the descheduler operand are removed. This enables the descheduler to be used for large clusters with many nodes and pods without failing due to out-of-memory errors.

[id="ocp-4-14-nodes-pod-topology-constraints-matchlabelkeys"]
==== Pod topology spread constraints matchLabelKeys parameter is now generally available

The `matchLabelKeys` parameter for configuring pod topology spread constraints is now generally available in {product-title} 4.14. Previously, the parameter was available as a Technology Preview feature by enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set. The `matchLabelKeys` parameter takes a list of pod label keys to select the pods to calculate spreading over.

For more information, see xref:../nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-pod-topology-spread-constraints.adoc#nodes-scheduler-pod-topology-spread-constraints[Controlling pod placement by using pod topology spread constraints].

[id="ocp-4-14-MaxUnavailableStatefulSet"]
==== MaxUnavailableStatefulSet enabled

With this release, the `MaxUnavailableStatefulSet` featureset configuration parameter is enabled by default. This allows users to define the maximum number of `StatefulSet` pods that can be unavailable during updates, and reduces application downtime when upgrading.

==== PAO must-gather image added to default must-gather image

With this release, the Performance Addon Operator (PAO) must-gather image is no longer required as an argument for the `must-gather` command to capture debugging data related to low-latency tuning. The functions of the PAO must-gather image are now under the default plugin image used by the `must-gather` command without any image arguments.

For further information about gathering debugging information relating to low-latency tuning, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/cnf-low-latency-tuning.adoc#cnf-collecting-low-latency-tuning-debugging-data-for-red-hat-support_cnf-master[Collecting low latency tuning debugging data for Red Hat Support].

{product-title} {product-version} introduces the following notable technical changes.

// Note: use [discrete] for these sub-headings.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-14-planned-psa-restricted-enforcement"]
=== Future restricted enforcement for pod security admission

Currently, pod security violations are shown as warnings and logged in the audit logs, but do not cause the pod to be rejected.

Global restricted enforcement for pod security admission is currently planned for the next minor release of {product-title}. When this restricted enforcement is enabled, pods with pod security violations will be rejected.

To prepare for this upcoming change, ensure that your workloads match the pod security admission profile that applies to them. Workloads that are not configured according to the enforced security standards defined globally or at the namespace level will be rejected. The `restricted-v2` SCC admits workloads according to the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#restricted[Restricted] Kubernetes definition.

If you are receiving pod security violations, see the following resources:

* See xref:../authentication/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission.adoc#security-context-constraints-psa-alert-eval_understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission[Identifying pod security violations] for information about how to find which workloads are causing pod security violations.

* See xref:../authentication/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission.adoc#security-context-constraints-psa-synchronization_understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission[Security context constraint synchronization with pod security standards] to understand when pod security admission label synchronization is performed. Pod security admission labels are not synchronized in certain situations, such as the following situations:
** The workload is running in a system-created namespace that is prefixed with `openshift-`.
** The workload is running on a pod that was created directly without a pod controller.

* If necessary, you can set a custom admission profile on the namespace or pod by setting the `pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce` label.

== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.8 and beyond! This needs some SME/QE review before being updated for 4.11. Need to check if KI should be removed or should stay.
* In {product-title} 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.
+
If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.1 to {product-version}, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. Unless there is a specific need for unauthenticated access, you should revoke it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP `403` errors if you revoke unauthenticated access.
====
+
Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:
+
[source,bash]
----
## Snippet to remove unauthenticated group from all the cluster role bindings
$ for clusterrolebinding in cluster-status-binding discovery system:basic-user system:discovery system:openshift:discovery ;
do
### Find the index of unauthenticated group in list of subjects
index=$(oc get clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} -o json | jq 'select(.subjects!=null) | .subjects | map(.name=="system:unauthenticated") | index(true)');
### Remove the element at index from subjects array
oc patch clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} --type=json --patch "[{'op': 'remove','path': '/subjects/$index'}]";
done
----
+
This script removes unauthenticated subjects from the following cluster role bindings:
+
--
** `cluster-status-binding`
** `discovery`
** `system:basic-user`
** `system:discovery`
** `system:openshift:discovery`
--
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821771[*BZ#1821771*])

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.9 and beyond!
* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])

[id="ocp-4-14-asynchronous-errata-updates"]
== Asynchronous errata updates

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for {product-title} {product-version} are released as asynchronous errata through the Red Hat Network. All {product-title} {product-version} errata is https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[available on the Red Hat Customer Portal]. See the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} Life Cycle] for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account settings for Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications are enabled, users are notified through email whenever new errata relevant to their registered systems are released.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming {product-title} entitlements for {product-title} errata notification emails to generate.
====

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of {product-title} {product-version}. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form {product-title} {product-version}.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any {product-title} release, always review the instructions on xref:../updating/updating_a_cluster/updating-cluster-web-console.adoc#updating-cluster-web-console[updating your cluster] properly.
