[id="ocp-4-14-rhcos"]
=== {op-system-first}

[id="ocp-4-14-rhcos-rhel-9-2-packages"]
==== {op-system} now uses {op-system-base} 9.2

{op-system} now uses {op-system-base-full} 9.2 packages in {product-title} {product-version}. This enables you to have the latest fixes, features, and enhancements, as well as the latest hardware support and driver updates. {product-title} 4.12 is an Extended Update Support (EUS) release that will continue to use {op-system-base} 8.6 EUS packages for the entirety of its lifecycle.

[id="ocp-4-14-rhel-9-considerations"]
===== Considerations for upgrading to {product-title} with {op-system-base} 9.2

Because {product-title} {product-version} now uses a {op-system-base} 9.2 based {op-system}, consider the following before upgrading:

* Some component configuration options and services might have changed between {op-system-base} 8.6 and {op-system-base} 9.2, which means existing machine configuration files might no longer be valid.

* {op-system-base} 6 base image containers are not supported on {op-system} container hosts but are supported on {op-system-base} 8 worker nodes. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/rhel-container-compatibility[Red Hat Container Compatibility] matrix.

* Some device drivers have been deprecated, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/considerations_in_adopting_rhel_9/assembly_hardware-enablement_considerations-in-adopting-rhel-9#unmaintained-hardware-support[{op-system-base} documentation] for more information.

[id="ocp-4-14-installation-and-update"]
=== Installation and update

[id="ocp-4-14-nat-gateway-azure"]
==== Installing a cluster on Microsoft Azure using a NAT gateway (Technology Preview)
In {product-title} {product-version}, you can install a cluster that uses a NAT gateway for outbound networking. This is available as a Technology Preview (TP). For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_azure/installation-config-parameters-azure.adoc#installation-configuration-parameters-additional-azure_installation-config-parameters-azure[Additional Azure configuration parameters].

[id="ocp-4-14-pd-balanced-disktype-gcp"]
==== Installing a cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using pd-balanced disk type
In {product-title} {product-version}, you can install a cluster on GCP using the `pd-balanced` disk type. This disk type is only available for compute nodes and cannot be used for control plane nodes. For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_gcp/installation-config-parameters-gcp.adoc#installation-configuration-parameters-additional-gcp_installation-config-parameters-gcp[Additional GCP configuration parameters].

[id="ocp-4-14-user-defined-tags-azure"]
==== User-defined tags for Microsoft Azure is now generally available

User-defined tags for Microsoft Azure was previously introduced as Technology Preview in {product-title} 4.13 and is now generally available in {product-title} 4.14. For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-customizations.adoc#installing-azure-user-defined-tags_installing-azure-customizations[Configuring the user-defined tags for Azure].

[id="ocp-4-14-user-defined-tags-gcp"]
==== User-defined labels and tags for Google Cloud Platform (Technology Preview)

You can now configure user-defined labels and tags in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for grouping resources and for managing resource access and cost. User-defined labels can be applied only to resources created by {product-title} installation program and its core components. User-defined tags can be applied only to resources created by the {product-title} Image Registry Operator. For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-customizations.adoc#installing-gcp-user-defined-labels-and-tags_installing-gcp-customizations[Managing the user-defined labels and tags for GCP].

[id="ocp-4-14-aws-security-groups"]
==== Applying existing AWS security groups to a cluster

By default, the installation program creates and attaches security groups to control plane and compute machines. The rules associated with the default security groups cannot be modified.

With {product-title} {product-version}, if you deploy a cluster to an existing Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), you can apply additional existing AWS security groups to control plane and compute machines. These security groups must be associated with the VPC that you are deploying the cluster to. Applying custom security groups can help you meet the security needs of your organization, in such cases where you must control the incoming or outgoing traffic of these machines.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-vpc.adoc#installation-aws-vpc-security-groups_installing-aws-vpc[Applying existing AWS security groups to the cluster].

[id="ocp-4-14-admin-ack-updating"]
==== Required administrator acknowledgment when updating from {product-title} 4.13 to 4.14

{product-title} 4.14 uses Kubernetes 1.27, which removed a xref:../release_notes/ocp-4-14-release-notes.adoc#ocp-4-14-removed-kube-1-27-apis[deprecated API].

A cluster administrator must provide a manual acknowledgment before the cluster can be updated from {product-title} 4.13 to 4.14. This is to help prevent issues after updating to {product-title} 4.14, where APIs that have been removed are still in use by workloads, tools, or other components running on or interacting with the cluster. Administrators must evaluate their cluster for any APIs in use that will be removed and migrate the affected components to use the appropriate new API version. After this is done, the administrator can provide the administrator acknowledgment.

All {product-title} 4.13 clusters require this administrator acknowledgment before they can be updated to {product-title} 4.14.

For more information, see xref:../updating/preparing_for_updates/updating-cluster-prepare.adoc#updating-cluster-prepare[Preparing to update to {product-title} 4.14].

[id="ocp-4-14-nutanix-three-node"]
==== Three-node cluster support for Nutanix
Deploying a three-node cluster is supported on Nutanix as of {product-title} {product-version}. This type of {product-title} cluster is a more resource efficient cluster. It consists of only three control plane machines, which also act as compute machines.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_nutanix/installing-nutanix-three-node.adoc#installing-nutanix-three-node[Installing a three-node cluster on Nutanix].

[id="ocp-4-14-installation-gcp-confidential-vms"]
==== Installing a cluster on GCP using Confidential VMs is generally available
In {product-title} {product-version}, using Confidential VMs when installing your cluster is generally available. Confidential VMs are currently not supported on 64-bit ARM architectures. For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-customizations.adoc#installation-gcp-enabling-confidential-vms_installing-gcp-customizations[Enabling Confidential VMs].

[id="ocp-4-14-dc-build-apis-disabled"]
==== DeploymentConfig and Build APIs can now be disabled

The `DeploymentConfig` and `Build` APIs are now optional cluster capabilities. You can disable them prior to installation, if necessary.

For more information, see xref:../installing/cluster-capabilities.adoc#cluster-capabilities[Cluster capabilities].

[id="ocp-4-14-rootvolume-types-openstack-available"]
==== Root volume types parameter for {rh-openstack} is now available
You can now specify one or more root volume types in {rh-openstack}, by using the `rootVolume.types` parameter. This parameter is available for both control plane and compute machines.

[id="ocp-4-14-static-ip-addresses-vsphere-nodes"]
==== Static IP addresses for vSphere nodes
You can provision bootstrap, control plane, and compute nodes with static IP addresses in environments where Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) does not exist.

:FeatureName: Static IP addresses for vSphere nodes
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

After you have deployed your cluster to run nodes with static IP addresses, you can scale a machine to use one of these static IP addresses. Additionally, you can use a machine set to configure a machine to use one of the configured static IP addresses.

For more information, see the "Static IP addresses for vSphere nodes" section in the xref:../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned.adoc[Installing a cluster on vSphere] document.

[id="ocp-4-14-bmo-validations"]
==== Additional validation for the Bare Metal Host CR

The Bare Metal Host Custom Resource (CR) now contains the `ValidatingWebhooks` parameter. With this parameter, the Bare Metal Operator now catches any configuration errors before accepting the CR, and returns a message with the configuration errors to the user.
[id="ocp-4-14-quickly-install-cluster-aws-local-zones"]
==== Install a cluster quickly in AWS Local Zones
For {product-title} {product-version}, you can quickly install a cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to extend compute nodes to Local Zone locations. After you add zone names to the installation configuration file, the installation program fully automates the creation of required resources, network and compute, on each Local Zone.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-localzone.adoc#installation-cluster-quickly-extend-workers_installing-aws-localzone[Intall a cluster quickly in AWS Local Zones].

[id="ocp-4-14-install-update-cco-manual-enhancements"]
==== Simplified installation and update experience for clusters with manually maintained cloud credentials

This release includes changes that improve the experience of installing and updating clusters that use the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) in manual mode for cloud provider authentication. The following parameters for the `oc adm release extract` command simplify the manual configuration of cloud credentials:

`--included`:: Use this parameter to extract only the manifests that your specific cluster configuration needs.
+
If you use cluster capabilities to disable one or more optional components, you are no longer required to delete the `CredentialsRequest` CRs for any disabled components before installing or updating a cluster.
+
In a future release, this parameter might make the CCO utility (`ccoctl`) `--enable-tech-preview` parameter unnecessary.

`--install-config`:: Use this parameter to specify the location of the `install-config.yaml` file when installing a cluster.
+
By referencing the `install-config.yaml` file, the extract command can determine aspects of the cluster configuration for the cluster that you are about to create. This parameter is not needed during a cluster update because `oc` can connect to the cluster to determine its configuration.
+
With this change, you are no longer required to specify the cloud platform you are installing on with the `--cloud` parameter. As a result, the `--cloud` parameter is deprecated starting in {product-title} 4.14.

To understand how to use these parameters, see the installation procedure for your configuration and the procedures in xref:../updating/preparing_for_updates/preparing-manual-creds-update.adoc#preparing-manual-creds-update[Preparing to update a cluster with manually maintained credentials].

[id="ocp-4-14-vsphere-pre-existing-template"]
==== Quickly install {op-system} on vSphere hosts by using a pre-existing {op-system} image template
{product-title} {product-version} includes a new VMware vSphere configuration parameter for use on installer-provisioned infrastructure: `template`. By using this parameter, you can now specify the absolute path to a pre-existing {op-system-first} image template or virtual machine in the installation configuration file. The installation program can then use the image template or virtual machine to quickly install {op-system} on vSphere hosts.

This installation method is an alternative to uploading an {op-system} image on vSphere hosts.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you set a path value for the `template` parameter, ensure that the default {op-system} boot image in the {product-title} release matches the {op-system} image template or virtual machine version; otherwise, cluster installation might fail.
====

[id="ocp-4-14-OCP-on-ARM"]
==== {product-title} on 64-bit ARM

{product-title} {product-version} is now supported on 64-bit ARM architecture-based Google Cloud Platform installer-provisioned and user-provisioned infrastructures. You can also now use the `oc mirror` CLI plug-in disconnected environments on 64-bit ARM clusters. For more information about instance availability and installation documentation, see xref:../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#supported-installation-methods-for-different-platforms[Supported installation methods for different platforms].

[id="ocp-4-14-azure-custom-rhcos"]
==== Using a custom {op-system} image for a Microsoft Azure cluster

By default, the installation program downloads and installs the {op-system-first} image that is used to boot control plane and compute machines. With this enhancement, you can now override the default behavior by modifying the installation configuration file (`install-config.yaml`) to specify a custom {op-system} image. Before you deploy the cluster, you can modify the following installation parameters:

* `compute.platorm.azure.osImage.publisher`
* `compute.platorm.azure.osImage.offer`
* `compute.platorm.azure.osImage.sku`
* `compute.platorm.azure.osImage.version`
* `controlPlane.platorm.azure.osImage.publisher`
* `controlPlane.platorm.azure.osImage.offer`
* `controlPlane.platorm.azure.osImage.sku`
* `controlPlane.platorm.azure.osImage.version`
* `platform.azure.defaultMachinePlatform.osImage.publisher`
* `platform.azure.defaultMachinePlatform.osImage.offer`
* `platform.azure.defaultMachinePlatform.osImage.sku`
* `platform.azure.defaultMachinePlatform.osImage.version`

For more information about these parameters, see xref:../installing/installing_azure/installation-config-parameters-azure.adoc#installation-configuration-parameters-additional-azure_installation-config-parameters-azure[Additional Azure configuration parameters].

[id="ocp-4-14-administrator-perspective"]
==== Administrator Perspective

With this release, there are several updates to the *Administrator* perspective of the web console. You can now perform the following actions:

* Narrow down the list of resources in a list view or search page with exact search capabilities. This will help when you have similarly named resources and fuzzy search does not narrow down your search.
* Provide direct feedback about features and report a bug by clicking the *Help* button on the toolbar and clicking *Share Feedback* from the drop-down list.
* Display and hide tooltips in the YAML editor. The tooltips will persist so you don't have to change it every time you navigate to the page.

[id="supported-os-types-cluster"]
===== Operating system based filtering in OperatorHub

With this update, Operators in OperatorHub are now filtered based on the nodes operating system because clusters can contain heterogenous nodes.

[id="console-supports-installing-specific-operator-versions"]
===== Support for installing specific Operator versions in the web console

With this update, you can now choose from a list of available versions for an Operator based on the selected channel on the *OperatorHub* page in the console. Additionally, you can view the metadata for that channel and version when available. When selecting an older version, a manual approval update strategy is required, otherwise the Operator will immediately update back to the latest version on the channel.

For more information, see xref:../operators/admin/olm-adding-operators-to-cluster.adoc#olm-installing-specific-version-web-console_olm-adding-operators-to-a-cluster[Installing a specific version of an Operator in the web console].

[id="console-supports-aws-sts-detection"]
===== OperatorHub support for AWS STS

With this release, OperatorHub detects when an Amazon Web Services (AWS) cluster is using the Security Token Service (STS). When detected, a "Cluster in STS Mode" notification displays with additional instructions before installing an Operator to ensure it runs correctly. The *Operator Installation* page is also modified to add the required *role ARN* field.

[id="oc-mirror-multi-arch-oci-local-images"]
==== Supporting multi-arch OCI local images for catalogs with oc-mirror

With {product-title} {product-version}, oc-mirror supports multi-arch OCI local images for catalogs.

OCI layouts consist of an `index.json` file that identifies the images held within them on disk. This `index.json` file can reference any number of single or multi-arch images. However, oc-mirror only references a single image at a time in a given OCI layout. The image stored in the OCI layout can be a single-arch image, that is, an image manifest or a multi-arch image, that is, a manifest list.

The `ImageSetConfiguration` stores the OCI images. After processing the catalog, the catalog content adds new layers representing the content of all images in the layout. The ImageBuilder is modified to handle image updates for both single-arch and multi-arch images.

[id="oc-logging-in-browser"]
==== Logging in to the CLI using a web browser

With {product-title} {product-version}, a new `oc` command-line interface (CLI) flag, `--web` is now available for the `oc login` command.

With this enhancement, you can log in using a web browser, which allows you to avoid inserting your access token into the command line.

For more information, see xref:../cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.adoc#cli-logging-in-web_cli-developer-commands[Logging in to the OpenShift CLI using a web browser].

[id="oc-new-build-enhancement"]
==== Enhancement to oc new-build

A new oc command line interface (CLI) flag, `--import-mode`, has been added to the `oc new-build` command. With this enhancement, users can set the `--import-mode` flag to `Legacy` or `PreserverOriginal`, which provides users the option to trigger builds using a single sub-manifest, or all manifests, respectively.

[id="oc-new-app-enhancement"]
==== Enhancement to oc new-app

A new oc command line interface (CLI) flag, `--import-mode`, has been added to the `oc new-app` command. With this enhancement, users can set the `--import-mode` flag to `Legacy` or `PreserverOriginal`, which provides users the option to create new applications using a single sub-manifest, or all manifests, respectively.

==== SCC preemption prevention

With this release, you can now require your workloads to use a specific security context constraint (SCC). By setting a specific SCC, you can prevent the SCC that you want from being preempted by another SCC in the cluster.

For more information, see xref:../authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.adoc#security-context-constraints-requiring_configuring-internal-oauth[Configuring a workload to require a specific SCC].

[id="ocp-4-14-auth-psa-privileged-namespaces"]
==== Pod security admission privileged namespaces

With this release, the following system namespaces are always set to the `privileged` pod security admission profile:

* `default`
* `kube-public`
* `kube-system`

For more information, see xref:../authentication/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission.adoc#psa-privileged-namespaces_understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission[Privileged namespaces].

[id="ocp-4-14-auth-psa-disable-sync-modified"]
==== Pod security admission synchronization disabled on modified namespaces

With this release, if a user manually modifies a pod security admission label from the automatically labeled value on a label-synchronized namespace, synchronization is disabled for that label. Users can enable synchronization again, if necessary.

For more information, see xref:../authentication/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission.adoc#security-context-constraints-psa-sync-exclusions_understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission[Pod security admission synchronization namespace exclusions].

[id="ocp-4-14-auth-cco-sts"]
==== OLM-based Operator support for AWS STS

With this release, some Operators managed by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) on Amazon Web Services (AWS) clusters can use the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) in manual mode with the Security Token Service (STS). These Operators authenticate with limited-privilege, short-term credentials that are managed outside the cluster.

For more information, see _Token authentication for Operators on cloud providers_.
//xref :../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-token-auth.adoc#osdk-token-auth[Token authentication for Operators on cloud providers].

[id="ocp-4-14-auth-op-noproxy"]
==== Authentication Operator honors `noProxy` during connection checks

With this release, if the `noProxy` field is set and the route is reachable without the cluster-wide proxy, the Authentication Operator will bypass the proxy and perform connection checks directly through the configured ingress route. Previously, the Authentication Operator always performed connection checks through the cluster-wide proxy, regardless of the `noProxy` setting.

Ingress Node Firewall Operator was made a technology preview in {product-title} 4.12. With this release, Ingress Node Firewall Operator is generally available. You can now configure firewall rules at the node level. For more information, see xref:../networking/networking-operators-overview.adoc#networking-operators-overview[Ingress Node Firewall Operator].

[id="ocp-4-14-networking-kernal-network-pinning"]
==== Dynamic use of non-reserved CPUs for OVS

With this release, the Open vSwitch (OVS) networking stack can dynamically use non-reserved CPUs.
This dynamic use of non-reserved CPUs occurs by default in nodes in a machine config pool that has a performance profile applied to it.
The dynamic use of available, non-reserved CPUs maximizes compute resources for OVS and minimizes network latency for workloads during periods of high demand.
OVS remains unable to dynamically use isolated CPUs assigned to containers in `Guaranteed` QoS pods. This separation avoids disruption to critical application workloads.

[NOTE]
====
When the Node Tuning Operator recognizes the performance conditions to activate the use of non-reserved CPUs, there is a several second delay while OVN-Kubernetes configures the CPU affinity alignment of OVS daemons running on the CPUs. During this window, if a `Guaranteed` QoS pod starts, it can experience a latency spike.
====

[id="ocp-4-14-networking-sriov-exclude-topology"]
==== Exclude SR-IOV network topology for NUMA-aware scheduling

With this release, you can exclude advertising the Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) node for the SR-IOV network to the Topology Manager. By not advertising the NUMA node for the SR-IOV network, you can permit more flexible SR-IOV network deployments during NUMA-aware pod scheduling.

For example, in some scenarios, it is a priority to maximize CPU and memory resources for a pod on a single NUMA node. By not providing a hint to the Topology Manager about the NUMA node for the pod’s SR-IOV network resource, the Topology Manager can deploy the SR-IOV network resource and the pod CPU and memory resources to different NUMA nodes. In earlier {product-title} releases, the Topology Manager attempted to place all resources on the same NUMA node only.

For more information about this more flexible SR-IOV network deployment during NUMA-aware pod scheduling, see xref:../networking/hardware_networks/configuring-sriov-device.adoc#nw-sriov-exclude-topology-manager_configuring-sriov-device[Exclude the SR-IOV network topology for NUMA-aware scheduling].

==== NMstate Operator updated in console

With this release, you can access the NMstate Operator and resources such as the `NodeNetworkState` (NNS), `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` (NNCP), and `NodeNetworkConfigurationEnhancement` (NNCE) from the web console. In the *Administrator* perspective of the console from the *Networking* page you can access NNCP as well as NNCE from the *NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy* page and NNS on the *NodeNetworkState* page. For more information about NMState resources and how to update them in the console, see xref:../networking/k8s_nmstate/k8s-nmstate-updating-node-network-config.adoc#k8s-nmstate-updating-node-network-config[Updating node network configuration].

[id="ocp-4-14-networking-ovn-kubernetes-ipsec-ibm-cloud"]

==== Admin Network Policy (Technology Preview)

Admin Network Policy is available as a Technology Preview feature.

You can enable `AdminNetworkPolicy` and `BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy` resources, which are part of the Network Policy V2 API, in clusters running the OVN-Kubernetes CNI plugin. Cluster administrators can apply cluster-scoped policies and safeguards for an entire cluster before namespaces are created. Network administrators can secure clusters by enforcing network traffic controls that cannot be overridden by users. Network administrators can enforce optional baseline network traffic controls that can be overridden by users in the cluster, if necessary. Currently, these APIs support only expressing policies for intra-cluster traffic.

[id="ocp-4-14-creating-subinterface"]
==== MAC-VLAN, IP-VLAN, and VLAN subinterface creation for pods

With this release, the ability to create a MAC-VLAN, IP-VLAN, and VLAN subinterface based on a master interface in a container namespace is generally available. You can use this feature to create the master interfaces as part of the pod network configuration in a separate network attachment definition. You can then base the VLAN, MACVLAN or IPVLAN on this interface without knowing the network configuration of the node. For more information, see xref:../networking/multiple_networks/configuring-additional-network.html#nw-about-configuring-master-interface-container_configuring-additional-network[About configuring the master interface in the container network namespace].

[id="ocp-4-14-tap-device-plugin"]
==== Enhance network flexibility by using the TAP device plugin

This release introduces a new Container Network Interface (CNI) network plugin type: the TAP device plugin. You can use this plugin to create TAP devices within containers, which enables user-space programs to handle network frames and act as an interface that receives frames from and that sends frames to user-space applications instead of through traditional network interfaces. For more information, see xref:../networking/multiple_networks/configuring-additional-network.html#nw-multus-tap-object_configuring-additional-network[Configuration for a TAP additional network].

[id="ocp-4-14-non-root-dpdk"]

[id="ocp-4-14-offline-tang"]
==== Support for offline Tang provisioning

With this release, you can now provision an {product-title} cluster with Tang-enforced, network-bound disk encryption (NBDE) using Tang servers that are unreachable during first boot.

For more information, see xref:../installing/install_config/installing-customizing.adoc#installation-special-config-encryption-threshold_installing-customizing[Configuring an encryption threshold] and xref:../installing/install_config/installing-customizing.adoc#installation-special-config-storage-procedure_installing-customizing[Configuring disk encryption and mirroring].

[id="ocp-4-14-new-cert-process"]
==== Certificates are now handled by the Machine Config Daemon

In previous {product-title} versions, the MCO read and handled certificates directly from machine configuration files. This led to rotation issues and created unwanted situations, like when certificates were stuck behind a paused machine config pool.

With this release, certificates are no longer templated from bootstrap into machine configuration files. Instead, they are put directly into the Ignition object, written onto a disk using the controller config, and handled by the Machine Config Daemon (MCD) during regular cluster operation. The certs are then visible using the `ControllerConfig` resource.

The Machine Config Controller (MCC) holds the following certificate data:

* `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet-ca.crt`
* `/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/configmaps/cloud-config/ca-bundle.pem`
* `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/openshift-config-user-ca-bundle.crt`

The MCC also handles the image registry certificates and its associated user bundle certificate.

This means that certificates are not bound by the machine config pool status and are more timely in their rotation.

The previously listed CAs stored in machine configuration files are removed, and the templated files found during cluster installation no longer exist.

For more information on how to access these certificates, see xref:../post_installation_configuration/machine-configuration-tasks.adoc#checking-mco-status-certs_post-install-machine-configuration-tasks[Viewing and interacting with certificates].

[id="ocp-4-14-nodes-pod-topology-constraints-matchlabelkeys"]
==== Pod topology spread constraints matchLabelKeys parameter is now generally available

The `matchLabelKeys` parameter for configuring pod topology spread constraints is now generally available in {product-title} 4.14. Previously, the parameter was available as a Technology Preview feature by enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set. The `matchLabelKeys` parameter takes a list of pod label keys to select the pods to calculate spreading over.

For more information, see xref:../nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-pod-topology-spread-constraints.adoc#nodes-scheduler-pod-topology-spread-constraints[Controlling pod placement by using pod topology spread constraints].

[id="ocp-4-14-cluster-cloud-controller-manager-operator"]
=== Cloud controller managers for additional cloud providers

The Kubernetes community plans to deprecate the use of the Kubernetes controller manager to interact with underlying cloud platforms in favor of using cloud controller managers. As a result, there is no plan to add Kubernetes controller manager support for any new cloud platforms.

This release introduces the General Availability of using cloud controller managers for Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.

To learn more about the cloud controller manager, see the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller/[Kubernetes Cloud Controller Manager documentation].

To manage the cloud controller manager and cloud node manager deployments and lifecycles, use the Cluster Cloud Controller Manager Operator.

[id="ocp-4-14-planned-psa-restricted-enforcement"]
=== Future restricted enforcement for pod security admission

Currently, pod security violations are shown as warnings and logged in the audit logs, but do not cause the pod to be rejected.

Global restricted enforcement for pod security admission is currently planned for the next minor release of {product-title}. When this restricted enforcement is enabled, pods with pod security violations will be rejected.

To prepare for this upcoming change, ensure that your workloads match the pod security admission profile that applies to them. Workloads that are not configured according to the enforced security standards defined globally or at the namespace level will be rejected. The `restricted-v2` SCC admits workloads according to the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#restricted[Restricted] Kubernetes definition.

If you are receiving pod security violations, see the following resources:

* See xref:../authentication/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission.adoc#security-context-constraints-psa-alert-eval_understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission[Identifying pod security violations] for information about how to find which workloads are causing pod security violations.

* See xref:../authentication/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission.adoc#security-context-constraints-psa-synchronization_understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission[Security context constraint synchronization with pod security standards] to understand when pod security admission label synchronization is performed. Pod security admission labels are not synchronized in certain situations, such as the following situations:
** The workload is running in a system-created namespace that is prefixed with `openshift-`.
** The workload is running on a pod that was created directly without a pod controller.

* If necessary, you can set a custom admission profile on the namespace or pod by setting the `pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce` label.

==== DeploymentConfig resources are now deprecated

As of {product-title} 4.14, `DeploymentConfig` objects are deprecated. `DeploymentConfig` objects are still supported, but are not recommended for new installations. Only security-related and critical issues will be fixed.

Instead, use `Deployment` objects or another alternative to provide declarative updates for pods.

[id="ocp-4-14-ztp-talm-defaultcatsrc-update"]
==== Operator-specific CatalogSource CRs used in {gitops-shortname} ZTP are deprecated

From {product-title} {product-version}, you must only use the `DefaultCatSrc.yaml` `CatalogSource` CR when updating Operators with {cgu-operator-first}. All other `CatalogSource` CRs are deprecated and are planned to be removed in a future release. Red{nbsp}Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this feature during the current release lifecycle, but this feature will no longer receive enhancements and will be removed. For more information about `DefaultCatSrc` CR, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-talm-updating-managed-policies.adoc#talo-operator-update_ztp-talm[Performing an Operator update].

==== The `--cloud` parameter for the `oc adm release extract` command

As of {product-title} 4.14, the `--cloud` parameter for the `oc adm release extract` command is deprecated. The introduction of the `--included` and `--install-config` parameters make the `--cloud` parameter unnecessary.

* Previously, if you did not specify a custom {op-system-first} AMI when installing an AWS cluster to a supported secret partition, the installation failed. With this update, the installation program validates that you have specified the ID of an {op-system} AMI in the installation configuration file before deploying the cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-13636[*OCPBUGS-13636*])

* Previously, the {product-title} installation program did not find private hosted zones in the host project during installations on Google Cloud Platform using a shared VPC. With this update, the installation program checks for an existing private hosted zone in the host project and uses the private hosted zone if it exists. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-11736[*OCPBUGS-11736*])

* Previously, if you configured user-defined outbound routing when installing a private Azure cluster, the cluster was incorrectly deployed with the default public load balancer. This behavior occurred when using the installer-provisioned infrastructure to install the cluster. With this update, the installation program no longer creates the public load balancer when user-defined routing is configured. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-9404[*OCPBUGS-9404*])

* Previously, the vSphere Terraform `vsphere_virtual_machine` resource did not include the `firmware` parameter. This issue caused the firmware of the virtual machine (VM) to be set to `bios`, basic input/output system (BIOS), by default instead of `efi`, Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI). Now, the resource includes the `firmware` parameter and sets `efi` as the default value for the parameter, so that the VM runs the EFI instead of the BIOS interface. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-9378[*OCPBUGS-9378*])

* Previously, for clusters that run on {rh-openstack}, in the deprovisioning phase of installation, the installer deleted object storage containers sequentially. This behavior caused slow and inefficient deletion of objects, especially with large containers. This problem occurred in part because image streams that use Swift containers accumulated objects over time. Now, bulk object deletion occurs concurrently with up to 3 calls to the {rh-openstack} API, improving efficiency by handling a higher object count per call. This optimization speeds up resource cleanup during deprovisioning. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-9081[*OCPBUGS-9081*])

* Previously, SSH access to bootstrap and cluster nodes failed when the bastion host ran in the same VPC network as the cluster nodes. Additionally, this configuration caused SSH access from the temporary bootstrap node to the cluster nodes to fail. These issues are now fixed by updating the IBM Cloud `SecurityGroupRules` to support SSH traffic between the temporary bootstrap node and cluster nodes, and to support SSH traffic from a bastion host to cluster nodes on the same VPC network. Log and debug information can be accurately collected for analysis during installer-provisioned infrastructure failure.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-8035[*OCPBUGS-8035*])

* Previously, DNS records that the installation program created were not removed when uninstalling a private cluster. With this update, the installation program now correctly removes these DNS records. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-7973[*OCPBUGS-7973*])

* Previously, a script provided in the documentation for checking invalid HTTPS certificates in the {rh-openstack} API assumed a recent version of the {rh-openstack} client. For users who did not have a recent version of the client, this script failed. Now, manual instructions are added to the documentation that users can follow to perform the check with any version of the client.

==== Monitoring

* Before this update, the `prometheus-adapter` pods might flood the Prometheus HTTP servers with too many requests when users requested pod metrics across all namespaces. The issue also became visible when the Vertical Pod Autoscaler was deployed. In the worst cases, `prometheus-adapter` pods would hit their maximum TCP connection request limit, and liveness probes might fail, which led to Prometheus pod restarts. With this update, the requests from a `prometheus-adapter` pod to the Prometheus service are limited to 100 simultaneous requests, thereby fixing the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-20250[*OCPBUGS-20250*])

* Before this update, the node-exporter could consume large amounts of CPU resources in some configurations. This update limits the number of CPUs that can be used simultaneously by the node-exporter. The number of CPUs is now set to `4` or to the number of CPUs available on the host, whichever is smaller. You can override this limit by using the `maxProcs` parameter in the config map settings for the node-exporter. See xref:../monitoring/config-map-reference-for-the-cluster-monitoring-operator.html#nodeexporterconfig[NodeExporterConfig] for more information. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-13153[*OCPBUGS-13153*])

* Before this update, large amounts of CPU resources might be consumed during metrics scraping as a result of the way the node-exporter collected network interface information. This release fixes this issue by improving the performance of node-exporter when collecting network interface information, thereby resolving the issue with excessive CPU usage during metrics scraping. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-12714[*OCPBUGS-12714*])

* Before this update, Thanos Querier failed to de-duplicate metrics by node roles. This update fixes the issue so that Thanos Querier now properly de-duplicates metrics by node roles. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-12525[*OCPBUGS-12525*])

* Before this update, the remote write endpoint for a user workload monitoring Prometheus pods did not have custom CA bundles injected so that the endpoint could not be protected using SSL. With this update, the trusted CA bundle has been added to user workload monitoring Prometheus pods so that users can secure the remote write endpoint using SSL. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-11958[*OCPBUGS-11958*])

==== Networking

* Previously, when a client mutual TLS (mTLS) was configured on an ingress controller, and the certificate authority (CA) certificates in the CA bundle required more than 1 MB of certificate revocation lists (CRL) to be downloaded, the CRL config map could not be updated due to size limitations. Because of the missing CRLs, connections with valid client certificates might have been rejected with the following error: `unknown ca`.
+
With this update, CRLs are no longer placed in a config map, and the router now directly downloads CRLs. As a result, the CRL config map for each ingress controller no longer exists. CRLs are now downloaded directly and connections with valid client certificates are no longer rejected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-6661[*OCPBUGS-6661*])

* Previously, a non-compliant upstream DNS server that provided a UDP response larger than {product-title}'s specified buffer size of 512 bytes caused CoreDNS to throw an overflow error. Consequently, it would not provide a response to a DNS query.
+
With this update, users can now configure the `protocolStrategy` field on the `dnses.operator.openshift.io` custom resource (CR) to be `TCP`. With this field set to  `TCP`, CoreDNS uses the TCP protocol for upstream requests and works around UDP overflow issues with non-compliant upstream DNS servers. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-6829[*OCPBUGS-6829*])

* Previously, if cluster administrators configured an infra node using a taint with the `NoExecute` effect, the Ingress Operator's canary pods would not be scheduled on these infra nodes. After some time, the DaemonSet configuration would get overridden, and the pods would be terminated on the infra nodes.
+
With this release, the Ingress Operator now configures the canary DaemonSet to tolerate a `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra` node taint that specifies the `NoExecute` effect. As a result, canary pods are scheduled on infra nodes regardless of what effect has been specified. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-9274[*OCPBUGS-9274*])

* Previously, when a client mutual TLS (mTLS) was configured on an ingress controller, if any of the client certificate authority (CA) certificates included a certificate revocation list (CRL) distribution point for a CRL issued by a different CA and that CRL expired, the mismatch between the distributing CA and the issuing CA caused the incorrect CRL to be downloaded. Consequently, the CRL bundle would be updated to contain an extra copy of the erroneously downloaded CRL, and the CRL that needed to be updated would be missing. Because of the missing CRL, connections with valid client certificates might have been rejected with the following error: `unknown ca`.
+
With this update, downloaded CRLs are now tracked by the CA that distributes them. When a CRL expires, the distributing CA's CRL distribution point is used to download an updated CRL. As a result, valid client certificates are no longer rejected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-9464[*OCPBUGS-9464*])

* Previously, when the Gateway API was enabled for {SMProductName}, the Ingress Operator would fail to configure and would return the following error: `the spec.techPreview.controlPlaneMode field is not supported in version 2.4+; use spec.mode`. With this release, the {SMProductShortName} `spec.techPreview.controlPlaneMode` API field in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` custom resource (CR) has been replaced with `spec.mode`. As a result, the Ingress Operator is able to create a `ServiceMeshControlPlane` custom resource, and the Gateway API works properly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-10714[*OCPBUGS-10714*])

* Previously, when configuring DNS for Gateway API gateways, the Ingress Operator would attempt to create a DNS record for a gateway listener, even if the listener specified a hostname with a domain that was outside of the cluster's base domain. Consequently, the Ingress Operator attempted, and failed, to publish DNS records, and would return the following error: `failed to publish DNS record to zone`.
+
With this update, when creating a `DNSRecord` custom resource (CR) for a gateway listener, the Ingress Operator now sets the `DNSRecord's` DNS management policy to `Unmanaged` if its domain is outside of the cluster's base domain. As a result, the Ingress Operator no longer attempts to publish records, and no longer logs the `failed to publish DNS record to zone` error. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-10875[*OCPBUGS-10875*])

* Previously, `oc explain route.spec.tls.insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy` documented the incorrect possible options that could be confusing some some users. With this release, the API documentation has been updated so that it shows the correct possible options for `insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy`. This is an API documentation fix only. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-11393[*OCPBUGS-11393*])

* Previously, a Cluster Network Operator controller monitored a broader set of resources than necessary, which resulted in its reconciler being triggered too often. Consequently, this increased the loads on both the Cluster Network Operator and the `kube-apiserver`.
+
With this update, the Cluster Network Operator `allowlist` controller monitors its `cni-sysctl-allowlist` config map for changes. As a result, rather than being triggered when any config map is changed, the `allowlist` controller reconciler is only triggered when changes are made to the `cni-sysctl-allowlist` config map or the `default-cni-sysctl-allowlist` config map. As a result, Cluter Network Operator API requests and config map requests are reduced. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-11565[*OCPBUGS-11565*]). 

* `segfault` failures that were related to HaProxy have been resolved. Users should no longer receive these errors. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-11595[*OCPBUGS-11595*])

== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.8 and beyond! This needs some SME/QE review before being updated for 4.11. Need to check if KI should be removed or should stay.
* In {product-title} 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.
+
If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.1 to {product-version}, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. Unless there is a specific need for unauthenticated access, you should revoke it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP `403` errors if you revoke unauthenticated access.
====
+
Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:
+
[source,bash]
----
## Snippet to remove unauthenticated group from all the cluster role bindings
$ for clusterrolebinding in cluster-status-binding discovery system:basic-user system:discovery system:openshift:discovery ;
do
### Find the index of unauthenticated group in list of subjects
index=$(oc get clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} -o json | jq 'select(.subjects!=null) | .subjects | map(.name=="system:unauthenticated") | index(true)');
### Remove the element at index from subjects array
oc patch clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} --type=json --patch "[{'op': 'remove','path': '/subjects/$index'}]";
done
----
+
This script removes unauthenticated subjects from the following cluster role bindings:
+
--
** `cluster-status-binding`
** `discovery`
** `system:basic-user`
** `system:discovery`
** `system:openshift:discovery`
--
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821771[*BZ#1821771*])

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.9 and beyond!
* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])

* If the installation program cannot get all of the projects that are associated with the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service account, the installation fails with a `context deadline exceeded` error message.
+
This behavior occurs when the following conditions are met:

** The service account has access to an excessive number of projects.
** The installation program is run with one of the following commands:
*** `openshift-install create install-config`
+

As a workaround, if you have an installation configuration file, update it with a specific project id to use (`platform.gcp.projectID`). Otherwise, manually create an installation configuration file, and enter a specific project id. Run the installation program again, specifying the file. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-15238[*OCPBUGS-15238*])

* Booting fails in a large compute node. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-20075[*OCPBUGS-20075*])

* When you deploy a cluster with a Network Type of `OVNKubernetes` on {ibmpowerProductName}, compute nodes may reboot because of a kernel stack overflow. As a workaround, you can deploy the cluster with a Network Type of `OpenShiftSDN`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-3901[*RHEL-3901*])

* The following known issue applies to users who updated their {product-title} deployment to an early access version of {product-version} using release candidate 3 or 4:
+
After the introduction of the node identify feature, some pods that were running as root are updated to run unprivileged. For users who updated to an early access version of {product-title} {product-version}, attempting to upgrade to the official version of {product-version} might not progress. In this scenario, the Network Operator reports the following state, indicating an issue with the update: `DaemonSet "/openshift-network-node-identity/network-node-identity" update is rolling`.
+
As a workaround, you can delete all pods in the `openshift-network-node-identify` namespace by running the following command: `oc delete --force=true -n openshift-network-node-identity --all pods`. After running this command, the update continues.
+
For more information about early access, xref:../updating/understanding_updates/understanding-update-channels-release.adoc#candidate-version-channel_understanding-update-channels-releases[candidate-4.14 channel].

* Currently, users cannot modify the `interface-specific` safe sysctl list by updating the `cni-sysctl-allowlist` config map in the `openshift-multus` namespace. As a workaround, you can modify, either manually or with a DaemonSet, the `/etc/cni/tuning/allowlist.conf` file on the node or nodes. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-11046[*OCPBUGS-11046*])

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for {product-title} {product-version} are released as asynchronous errata through the Red Hat Network. All {product-title} {product-version} errata is https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[available on the Red Hat Customer Portal]. See the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} Life Cycle] for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account settings for Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications are enabled, users are notified through email whenever new errata relevant to their registered systems are released.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming {product-title} entitlements for {product-title} errata notification emails to generate.
====

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of {product-title} {product-version}. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form {product-title} {product-version}.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any {product-title} release, always review the instructions on xref:../updating/updating_a_cluster/updating-cluster-web-console.adoc#updating-cluster-web-console[updating your cluster] properly.
