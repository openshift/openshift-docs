[id="ocp-4-14-new-features-and-enhancements"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

[id="ocp-4-14-rhcos"]
=== {op-system-first}


[id="ocp-4-14-installation-and-update"]
=== Installation and update

[id="ocp-4-14-user-defined-tags-azure"]
==== User-defined tags for Microsoft Azure is now generally available

User-defined tags for Microsoft Azure was previously introduced as Technology Preview in {product-title} 4.13 and is now generally available in {product-title} 4.14. For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-customizations.adoc#installing-azure-user-defined-tags_installing-azure-customizations[Configuring the user-defined tags for Azure].

[id="ocp-4-14-aws-security-groups"]
==== Applying existing AWS security groups to a cluster

By default, the installation program creates and attaches security groups to control plane and compute machines. The rules associated with the default security groups cannot be modified.

With {product-title} {product-version}, if you deploy a cluster to an existing Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), you can apply additional existing AWS security groups to control plane and compute machines. These security groups must be associated with the VPC that you are deploying the cluster to. Applying custom security groups can help you meet the security needs of your organization, in such cases where you must control the incoming or outgoing traffic of these machines.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-vpc.adoc#installation-aws-vpc-security-groups_installing-aws-vpc[Applying existing AWS security groups to the cluster].

[id="ocp-4-14-admin-ack-updating"]
==== Required administrator acknowledgment when updating from {product-title} 4.13 to 4.14

{product-title} 4.14 uses Kubernetes 1.27, which removed a xref:../release_notes/ocp-4-14-release-notes.adoc#ocp-4-14-removed-kube-1-27-apis[deprecated API].

A cluster administrator must provide a manual acknowledgment before the cluster can be updated from {product-title} 4.13 to 4.14. This is to help prevent issues after updating to {product-title} 4.14, where APIs that have been removed are still in use by workloads, tools, or other components running on or interacting with the cluster. Administrators must evaluate their cluster for any APIs in use that will be removed and migrate the affected components to use the appropriate new API version. After this is done, the administrator can provide the administrator acknowledgment.

All {product-title} 4.13 clusters require this administrator acknowledgment before they can be updated to {product-title} 4.14.

For more information, see xref:../updating/preparing_for_updates/updating-cluster-prepare.adoc#updating-cluster-prepare[Preparing to update to {product-title} 4.14].

[id="ocp-4-14-nutanix-three-node"]
==== Three-node cluster support for Nutanix
Deploying a three-node cluster is supported on Nutanix as of {product-title} {product-version}. This type of {product-title} cluster is a more resource efficient cluster. It consists of only three control plane machines, which also act as compute machines.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_nutanix/installing-nutanix-three-node.adoc#installing-nutanix-three-node[Installing a three-node cluster on Nutanix].

[id="ocp-4-14-installation-gcp-confidential-vms"]
==== Installing a cluster on GCP using Confidential VMs is generally available
In {product-title} {product-version}, using Confidential VMs when installing your cluster is generally available. For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-customizations.adoc#installation-gcp-enabling-confidential-vms_installing-gcp-customizations[Enabling Confidential VMs].

[id="ocp-4-14-dc-build-apis-disabled"]
==== DeploymentConfig and Build APIs can now be disabled

The `DeploymentConfig` and `Build` APIs are now optional cluster capabilities. You can disable them prior to installation, if necessary.

For more information, see xref:../installing/cluster-capabilities.adoc#cluster-capabilities[Cluster capabilities].

[id="ocp-4-14-rootvolume-types-openstack-available"]
==== Root volume types parameter for {rh-openstack} is now available
You can now specify one or more root volume types in {rh-openstack}, by using the `rootVolume.types` parameter. This parameter is available for both control plane and compute machines.

[id="ocp-4-14-static-ip-addresses-vsphere-nodes"]
==== Static IP addresses for vSphere nodes
You can provision bootstrap, control plane, and compute nodes with static IP addresses in environments where Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) does not exist.

:FeatureName: Static IP addresses for vSphere nodes
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

After you have deployed your cluster to run nodes with static IP addresses, you can scale a machine to use one of these static IP addresses. Additionally, you can use a machine set to configure a machine to use one of the configured static IP addresses.

For more information, see the "Static IP addresses for vSphere nodes" section in the xref:../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned.adoc[Installing a cluster on vSphere] document.

[id="ocp-4-14-bmo-validations"]
==== Additional validation for the Bare Metal Host CR

The Bare Metal Host Custom Resource (CR) now contains the `ValidatingWebhooks` parameter. With this parameter, the Bare Metal Operator now catches any configuration errors before accepting the CR, and returns a message with the configuration errors to the user.
[id="ocp-4-14-quickly-install-cluster-aws-local-zones"]
==== Install a cluster quickly in AWS Local Zones
For {product-title} {product-version}, you can quickly install a cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to extend compute nodes to Local Zone locations. After you add zone names to the installation configuration file, the installation program fully automates the creation of required resources, network and compute, on each Local Zone.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-localzone.adoc#installation-cluster-quickly-extend-workers_installing-aws-localzone[Intall a cluster quickly in AWS Local Zones].


[id="ocp-4-14-vsphere-pre-existing-template"]
==== Quickly install {op-system} on vSphere hosts by using a pre-existing {op-system} image template
{product-title} {product-version} includes a new VMware vSphere configuration parameter for use on installer-provisioned infrastructure: `template`. By using this parameter, you can now specify the absolute path to a pre-existing {op-system-first} image template or virtual machine in the installation configuration file. The installation program can then use the image template or virtual machine to quickly install {op-system} on vSphere hosts.

This installation method is an alternative to uploading an {op-system} image on vSphere hosts.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you set a path value for the `template` parameter, ensure that the default {op-system} boot image in the {product-title} release matches the {op-system} image template or virtual machine version; otherwise, cluster installation might fail.
====

[id="ocp-4-14-OCP-on-ARM"]
==== {product-title} on 64-bit ARM

{product-title} {product-version} is now supported on 64-bit ARM architecture-based Google Cloud Platform installer-provisioned and user-provisioned infrastructures. You can also now use the `oc mirror` CLI plug-in disconnected environments on 64-bit ARM clusters. For more information about instance availability and installation documentation, see xref:../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#supported-installation-methods-for-different-platforms[Supported installation methods for different platforms].

==== {product-title} cluster with multi-architecture compute machines
{product-title} {product-version} clusters with multi-architecture compute machines are now supported on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as a Day 2 operation. {product-title} clusters with multi-architecture compute machines on bare metal installations are now generally available. For more information on clusters with multi-architecture compute machines and supported platforms, see xref:../post_installation_configuration/configuring-multi-arch-compute-machines/multi-architecture-configuration.adoc#multi-architecture-configuration[About clusters with multi-architecture compute machines].

[id="ocp-4-14-web-console"]
=== Web console

[id="ocp-4-14-administrator-perspective"]
==== Administrator Perspective

With this release, there are several updates to the *Administrator* perspective of the web console. You can now perform the following actions:

* Narrow down the list of resources in a list view or search page with exact search capabilities. This will help when you have similarly named resources and fuzzy search does not narrow down your search.
* Provide direct feedback about features and report a bug by clicking the *Help* button on the toolbar and clicking *Share Feedback* from the drop-down list.
* Display and hide tooltips in the YAML editor. The tooltips will persist so you don't have to change it every time you navigate to the page.

[id="supported-os-types-cluster"]
===== Operating system based filtering in OperatorHub

With this update, Operators in OperatorHub are now filtered based on the nodes operating system because clusters can contain heterogenous nodes.

[id="console-supports-installing-specific-operator-versions"]
===== Support for installing specific Operator versions in the web console

With this update, you can now choose from a list of available versions for an Operator based on the selected channel on the *OperatorHub* page in the console. Additionally, you can view the metadata for that channel and version when available. When selecting an older version, a manual approval update strategy is required, otherwise the Operator will immediately update back to the latest version on the channel.

//link to content in Operator book TBD

[id="console-supports-aws-sts-detection"]
===== OperatorHub support for AWS STS

With this release, OperatorHub detects when an Amazon Web Services (AWS) cluster is using the Security Token Service (STS). When detected, a "Cluster in STS Mode" notification displays with additional instructions before installing an Operator to ensure it runs correctly. The *Operator Installation* page is also modified to add the required *role ARN* field.

For more information, see _Token authentication for Operators on cloud providers_.

==== Developer Perspective

[id="ocp-4-14-openshift-cli"]
=== OpenShift CLI (oc)

[id="oc-mirror-multi-arch-oci-local-images"]
==== Supporting multi-arch OCI local images for catalogs with oc-mirror

With {product-title} {product-version}, oc-mirror supports multi-arch OCI local images for catalogs.

OCI layouts consist of an `index.json` file that identifies the images held within them on disk. This `index.json` file can reference any number of single or multi-arch images. However, oc-mirror only references a single image at a time in a given OCI layout. The image stored in the OCI layout can be a single-arch image, that is, an image manifest or a multi-arch image, that is, a manifest list.

The `ImageSetConfiguration` stores the OCI images. After processing the catalog, the catalog content adds new layers representing the content of all images in the layout. The ImageBuilder is modified to handle image updates for both single-arch and multi-arch images.

[id="oc-logging-in-browser"]
==== Logging in to the CLI using a web browser

With {product-title} {product-version}, a new `oc` command-line interface (CLI) flag, `--web` is now available for the `oc login` command.

With this enhancement, you can log in using a web browser, which allows you to avoid inserting your access token into the command line.

For more information, see xref:../cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.adoc#cli-logging-in-web_cli-developer-commands[Logging in to the OpenShift CLI using a web browser].

[id="oc-new-build-enhancement"]
==== Enhancement to oc new-build

A new oc command line interface (CLI) flag, `--import-mode`, has been added to the `oc new-build` command. With this enhancement, users can set the `--import-mode` flag to `Legacy` or `PreserverOriginal`, which provides users the option to trigger builds using a single sub-manifest, or all manifests, respectively.

[id="oc-new-app-enhancement"]
==== Enhancement to oc new-app

A new oc command line interface (CLI) flag, `--import-mode`, has been added to the `oc new-app` command. With this enhancement, users can set the `--import-mode` flag to `Legacy` or `PreserverOriginal`, which provides users the option to create new applications using a single sub-manifest, or all manifests, respectively.

For more information, see xref:../applications/creating_applications/creating-applications-using-cli.adoc#setting-the-import-mode[Setting the import mode].

=== {ibmpowerProductName}

[id="ocp-4-14-auth"]
=== Authentication and authorization

[id="ocp-4-14-auth-required-scc"]
==== SCC preemption prevention

With this release, you can now require your workloads to use a specific security context constraint (SCC). By setting a specific SCC, you can prevent the SCC that you want from being preempted by another SCC in the cluster.

For more information, see xref:../authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.adoc#security-context-constraints-requiring_configuring-internal-oauth[Configuring a workload to require a specific SCC].

[id="ocp-4-14-auth-psa-privileged-namespaces"]
==== Pod security admission privileged namespaces

With this release, the following system namespaces are always set to the `privileged` pod security admission profile:

* `default`
* `kube-public`
* `kube-system`

For more information, see xref:../authentication/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission.adoc#psa-privileged-namespaces_understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission[Privileged namespaces].

[id="ocp-4-14-auth-psa-disable-sync-modified"]
==== Pod security admission synchronization disabled on modified namespaces

With this release, if a user manually modifies a pod security admission label from the automatically labeled value on a label-synchronized namespace, synchronization is disabled for that label. Users can enable synchronization again, if necessary.

For more information, see xref:../authentication/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission.adoc#security-context-constraints-psa-sync-exclusions_understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission[Pod security admission synchronization namespace exclusions].

[id="ocp-4-14-auth-cco-sts"]
==== OLM-based Operator support for AWS STS

With this release, some Operators managed by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) on Amazon Web Services (AWS) clusters can use the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) in manual mode with the Security Token Service (STS). These Operators authenticate with limited-privilege, short-term credentials that are managed outside the cluster.

For more information, see _Token authentication for Operators on cloud providers_.
//xref:../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-token-auth.adoc#osdk-token-auth[Token authentication for Operators on cloud providers].

[id="ocp-4-14-networking"]
=== Networking

[id="ocp-4-14-ingress-node-firewall-operator-ga"]
==== Ingress Node Firewall Operator is generally available
Ingress Node Firewall Operator was made a technology preview in {product-title} 4.12. With this release, Ingress Node Firewall Operator is generally available. You can now configure firewall rules at the node level. For more information, see xref:../networking/networking-operators-overview.adoc#networking-operators-overview[Ingress Node Firewall Operator].

[id="ocp-4-14-networking-kernal-network-pinning"]
==== Dynamic use of non-reserved CPUs for OVS

With this release, the Open vSwitch (OVS) networking stack can dynamically use non-reserved CPUs.
This dynamic use of non-reserved CPUs occurs by default in nodes in a machine config pool that has a performance profile applied to it.
The dynamic use of available, non-reserved CPUs maximizes compute resources for OVS and minimizes network latency for workloads during periods of high demand.
OVS remains unable to dynamically use isolated CPUs assigned to containers in `Guaranteed` QoS pods. This separation avoids disruption to critical application workloads.

[NOTE]
====
When the Node Tuning Operator recognizes the performance conditions to activate the use of non-reserved CPUs, there is a several second delay while OVN-Kubernetes configures the CPU affinity alignment of OVS daemons running on the CPUs. During this window, if a `Guaranteed` QoS pod starts, it can experience a latency spike.
====

[id="ocp-4-14-networking-sriov-exclude-topology"]
==== Exclude SR-IOV network topology for NUMA-aware scheduling

With this release, you can exclude advertising the Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) node for the SR-IOV network to the Topology Manager. By not advertising the NUMA node for the SR-IOV network, you can permit more flexible SR-IOV network deployments during NUMA-aware pod scheduling.

For example, in some scenarios, it is a priority to maximize CPU and memory resources for a pod on a single NUMA node. By not providing a hint to the Topology Manager about the NUMA node for the pod’s SR-IOV network resource, the Topology Manager can deploy the SR-IOV network resource and the pod CPU and memory resources to different NUMA nodes. In earlier {product-title} releases, the Topology Manager attempted to place all resources on the same NUMA node only.

For more information about this more flexible SR-IOV network deployment during NUMA-aware pod scheduling, see xref:../networking/hardware_networks/configuring-sriov-device.adoc#nw-sriov-exclude-topology-manager_configuring-sriov-device[Exclude the SR-IOV network topology for NUMA-aware scheduling].

[id="ocp-4-14-networking-haproxy-update"]
==== Update to HAProxy 2.6
With this release, {product-title} updated to HAProxy 2.6.

[id="ocp-4-14-nmstate-ui-console-update"]
==== NMstate Operator updated in console

With this release, you can access the NMstate Operator and resources such as the `NodeNetworkState` (NNS), `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` (NNCP), and `NodeNetworkConfigurationEnhancement` (NNCE) from the web console. In the *Administrator* perspective of the console from the *Networking* page you can access NNCP as well as NNCE from the *NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy* page and NNS on the *NodeNetworkState* page. For more information about NMState resources and how to update them in the console, see xref:../networking/k8s_nmstate/k8s-nmstate-updating-node-network-config.adoc#k8s-nmstate-updating-node-network-config[Updating node network configuration].

[id="ocp-4-14-networking-ovn-kubernetes-ipsec-ibm-cloud"]
==== OVN-Kubernetes network plugin support for IPsec on IBM Cloud

IPsec is now supported on the IBM Cloud platform for clusters that use the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, which is the default in {product-title} 4.14. For more information, see xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/configuring-ipsec-ovn.adoc#configuring-ipsec-ovn[Configuring IPsec encryption].

[id="ocp-4-14-single-stack-support-nmstate"]
==== Single-stack IPv6 support for Kubernetes NMstate
With this release, you can use Kubernetes NMState Operator in single-stack IPv6 clusters.

[id="ocp-4-14-networking-egress-service"]
==== Egress service resource to manage egress traffic for pods behind a load balancer (Technology Preview)

With this update, you can use an `EgressService` custom resource (CR) to manage egress traffic for pods behind a load balancer service. This is available as a Technology Preview feature.

You can use the `EgressService` CR to manage egress traffic in the following ways:

* Assign the load balancer service's IP address as the source IP address of egress traffic for pods behind the load balancer service.

* Assign the egress traffic for pods behind a load balancer to a different network than the default node network.

For more information, see xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/configuring-egress-traffic-for-vrf-loadbalancer-services.adoc#configuring-egress-traffic-loadbalancer-services[Configuring an egress service].

[id="ocp-4-14-networking-metallb-vrf"]
==== Support for VRF specification in MetalLB's BGPPeer resource (Technology Preview)

With this update, you can specify a Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instance in a `BGPPeer` custom resource. MetalLB can advertise services through the interfaces belonging to the VRF. This is available as a Technology Preview feature.

For more information, see xref:../networking/metallb/metallb-configure-bgp-peers.adoc#nw-metallb-bgp-peer-vrf_configure-metallb-bgp-peers[Exposing a service through a network VRF].

[id="ocp-4-14-networking-nmstate-vrf"]
==== Support for VRF specification in NMState's NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy resource (Technology Preview)

With this update, you can associate a Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instance with a network interface by using a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` custom resource. By associating a VRF instance with a network interface, you can support traffic isolation, independent routing decisions, and the logical separation of network resources. This feature is available as a Technology Preview feature.

For more information, see xref:../networking/k8s_nmstate/k8s-nmstate-updating-node-network-config.adoc#virt-example-host-vrf_k8s_nmstate-updating-node-network-config[Example: Network interface with a VRF instance node network configuration policy].

[id="ocp-414-broadcom-bcm57504-support"]
==== Support for Broadcom BCM57504 is now GA

Support for the Broadcom BCM57504 network interface controller is now available for the SR-IOV Network Operator.

For more information, see xref:../networking/hardware_networks/about-sriov.adoc#supported-devices_about-sriov[Supported devices].

[id="ocp-4-14-admin-network-policy"]
==== Admin Network Policy (Technology Preview)

Admin Network Policy is available as a Technology Preview feature.

You can enable `AdminNetworkPolicy` and `BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy` resources, which are part of the Network Policy V2 API, in clusters running the OVN-Kubernetes CNI plugin. Cluster administrators can apply cluster-scoped policies and safeguards for an entire cluster before namespaces are created. Network administrators can secure clusters by enforcing network traffic controls that cannot be overridden by users. Network administrators can enforce optional baseline network traffic controls that can be overridden by users in the cluster, if necessary. Currently, these APIs support only expressing policies for intra-cluster traffic.

[id="ocp-4-14-creating-subinterface"]
==== MAC-VLAN, IP-VLAN, and VLAN subinterface creation for pods

With this release, the ability to create a MAC-VLAN, IP-VLAN, and VLAN subinterface based on a master interface in a container namespace is generally available. You can use this feature to create the master interfaces as part of the pod network configuration in a separate network attachment definition. You can then base the VLAN, MACVLAN or IPVLAN on this interface without knowing the network configuration of the node. For more information, see xref:../networking/multiple_networks/configuring-additional-network.html#nw-about-configuring-master-interface-container_configuring-additional-network[About configuring the master interface in the container network namespace].

[id="ocp-4-14-tap-device-plugin"]
==== Enhance network flexibility by using the TAP device plugin

This release introduces a new Container Network Interface (CNI) network plugin type: the TAP device plugin. You can use this plugin to create TAP devices within containers, which enables user-space programs to handle network frames and act as an interface that receives frames from and that sends frames to user-space applications instead of through traditional network interfaces. For more information, see xref:../networking/multiple_networks/configuring-additional-network.html#nw-multus-tap-object_configuring-additional-network[Configuration for a TAP additional network].

[id="ocp-4-14-non-root-dpdk"]

=== Nodes

[id="ocp-4-14-descheduler-resource-limits"]
==== Descheduler resource limits for large clusters

With this release, the resource limits for the descheduler operand are removed. This enables the descheduler to be used for large clusters with many nodes and pods without failing due to out-of-memory errors.

[id="ocp-4-14-nodes-pod-topology-constraints-matchlabelkeys"]
==== Pod topology spread constraints matchLabelKeys parameter is now generally available

The `matchLabelKeys` parameter for configuring pod topology spread constraints is now generally available in {product-title} 4.14. Previously, the parameter was available as a Technology Preview feature by enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set. The `matchLabelKeys` parameter takes a list of pod label keys to select the pods to calculate spreading over.

For more information, see xref:../nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-pod-topology-spread-constraints.adoc#nodes-scheduler-pod-topology-spread-constraints[Controlling pod placement by using pod topology spread constraints].

[id="ocp-4-14-MaxUnavailableStatefulSet"]

[id="ocp-4-14-scalability-and-performance"]
=== Scalability and performance

[id="ocp-4-14-PAO-image-must-gather"]
==== PAO must-gather image added to default must-gather image

With this release, the Performance Addon Operator (PAO) must-gather image is no longer required as an argument for the `must-gather` command to capture debugging data related to low-latency tuning. The functions of the PAO must-gather image are now under the default plugin image used by the `must-gather` command without any image arguments.

For further information about gathering debugging information relating to low-latency tuning, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/cnf-low-latency-tuning.adoc#cnf-collecting-low-latency-tuning-debugging-data-for-red-hat-support_cnf-master[Collecting low latency tuning debugging data for Red Hat Support].

[id="ocp-4-14-NRO-image-must-gather"]
==== Collecting data for the NUMA Resources Operator with the must-gather image of the operator

In this release, the `must-gather` tool is updated to collect the data of the NUMA Resources Operator with the `must-gather` image of the operator.

For further information about gathering debugging information for the NUMA Resources Operator, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/cnf-numa-aware-scheduling.html#cnf-about-collecting-nro-data_numa-aware[Collecting NUMA Resources Operator data].

[id="ocp-4-14-additional-power-savings-control"]
==== Enabling more control over the C-states for each pod

With this release, you have more control over the C-states for your pods. Now, instead of disabling C-states completely, you can specify a maximum latency in microseconds for C-states. You can configure this option in the `cpu-c-states.crio.io` annotation, which helps to optimize power savings in high-priority applications by enabling some of the shallower C-states instead of disabling them completely.

For further information about enabling more control over the C-states, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/cnf-low-latency-tuning.html#node-tuning-operator-pod-power-saving-config_cnf-master[Optional: Power saving configurations].

[id="ocp-4-14-nw-ipv6-spoke-cluster-support"]
==== Support for provisioning IPv6 spoke clusters from dual-stack hub clusters
With this update, you can provision IPv6 address spoke clusters from dual-stack hub clusters. In a zero touch provisioning (ZTP) environment, the HTTP server on the hub cluster that hosts the boot ISO now listens on both IPv4 and IPv6 networks. The provisioning service also checks the baseboard management controller (BMC) address scheme on the target spoke cluster and provides a matching URL for the installation media. These updates offer the ability to provision single-stack, IPv6 spoke clusters from a dual-stack hub cluster.

[id="ocp-4-14-precaching-user-spec-images"]
==== Pre-caching user-specified images with {cgu-operator-full}

With this release, you can pre-cache your application workload images before upgrading your applications on {sno} clusters with {cgu-operator-full}. For more information, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-talm-updating-managed-policies.adoc#talm-prechache-user-specified-images-concept_ztp-talm[Pre-caching user-specified images with TALM on single-node OpenShift clusters].

[id="ocp-4-14-cluster-cloud-controller-manager-operator"]
=== Cloud controller managers for additional cloud providers

The Kubernetes community plans to deprecate the use of the Kubernetes controller manager to interact with underlying cloud platforms in favor of using cloud controller managers. As a result, there is no plan to add Kubernetes controller manager support for any new cloud platforms.

This release introduces the General Availability of using cloud controller managers for Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.

To learn more about the cloud controller manager, see the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller/[Kubernetes Cloud Controller Manager documentation].

To manage the cloud controller manager and cloud node manager deployments and lifecycles, use the Cluster Cloud Controller Manager Operator.

For more information, see the xref:../operators/operator-reference.adoc#cluster-cloud-controller-manager-operator_cluster-operators-ref[Cluster Cloud Controller Manager Operator] entry in the _Platform Operators reference_.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-14-planned-psa-restricted-enforcement"]
=== Future restricted enforcement for pod security admission

Currently, pod security violations are shown as warnings and logged in the audit logs, but do not cause the pod to be rejected.

Global restricted enforcement for pod security admission is currently planned for the next minor release of {product-title}. When this restricted enforcement is enabled, pods with pod security violations will be rejected.

To prepare for this upcoming change, ensure that your workloads match the pod security admission profile that applies to them. Workloads that are not configured according to the enforced security standards defined globally or at the namespace level will be rejected. The `restricted-v2` SCC admits workloads according to the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#restricted[Restricted] Kubernetes definition.

If you are receiving pod security violations, see the following resources:

* See xref:../authentication/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission.adoc#security-context-constraints-psa-alert-eval_understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission[Identifying pod security violations] for information about how to find which workloads are causing pod security violations.

* See xref:../authentication/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission.adoc#security-context-constraints-psa-synchronization_understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission[Security context constraint synchronization with pod security standards] to understand when pod security admission label synchronization is performed. Pod security admission labels are not synchronized in certain situations, such as the following situations:
** The workload is running in a system-created namespace that is prefixed with `openshift-`.
** The workload is running on a pod that was created directly without a pod controller.

* If necessary, you can set a custom admission profile on the namespace or pod by setting the `pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce` label.

== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.8 and beyond! This needs some SME/QE review before being updated for 4.11. Need to check if KI should be removed or should stay.
* In {product-title} 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.
+
If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.1 to {product-version}, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. Unless there is a specific need for unauthenticated access, you should revoke it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP `403` errors if you revoke unauthenticated access.
====
+
Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:
+
[source,bash]
----
## Snippet to remove unauthenticated group from all the cluster role bindings
$ for clusterrolebinding in cluster-status-binding discovery system:basic-user system:discovery system:openshift:discovery ;
do
### Find the index of unauthenticated group in list of subjects
index=$(oc get clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} -o json | jq 'select(.subjects!=null) | .subjects | map(.name=="system:unauthenticated") | index(true)');
### Remove the element at index from subjects array
oc patch clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} --type=json --patch "[{'op': 'remove','path': '/subjects/$index'}]";
done
----
+
This script removes unauthenticated subjects from the following cluster role bindings:
+
--
** `cluster-status-binding`
** `discovery`
** `system:basic-user`
** `system:discovery`
** `system:openshift:discovery`
--
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821771[*BZ#1821771*])

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.9 and beyond!
* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])

* If the installation program cannot get all of the projects that are associated with the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service account, the installation fails with a `context deadline exceeded` error message.
+
This behavior occurs when the following conditions are met:

** The service account has access to an excessive number of projects.
** The installation program is run with one of the following commands:
*** `openshift-install create install-config`
+

As a workaround, if you have an installation configuration file, update it with a specific project id to use (`platform.gcp.projectID`). Otherwise, manually create an installation configuration file, and enter a specific project id. Run the installation program again, specifying the file.

[id="ocp-4-14-asynchronous-errata-updates"]
== Asynchronous errata updates

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for {product-title} {product-version} are released as asynchronous errata through the Red Hat Network. All {product-title} {product-version} errata is https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[available on the Red Hat Customer Portal]. See the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} Life Cycle] for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account settings for Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications are enabled, users are notified through email whenever new errata relevant to their registered systems are released.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming {product-title} entitlements for {product-title} errata notification emails to generate.
====

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of {product-title} {product-version}. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form {product-title} {product-version}.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any {product-title} release, always review the instructions on xref:../updating/updating_a_cluster/updating-cluster-web-console.adoc#updating-cluster-web-console[updating your cluster] properly.
