[id="ocp-4-9-about-this-release"]
== About this release

// TODO: Update k8s link once there is a version-specific URL for the Kubernetes release
{product-title} (link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:2438[RHSA-2021:2438]) is now available. This release uses link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md[Kubernetes 1.22] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

//Red Hat did not publicly release {product-title} 4.9.0 as the GA version and, instead, is releasing {product-title} 4.9.TBD as the GA version.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift. The {cloud-redhat-com} application for {product-title} allows you to deploy OpenShift clusters to either on-premise or cloud environments.

{product-title} {product-version} is supported on {op-system-base-full} 7.9 and 8.4, as well as on {op-system-first} 4.9.

You must use {op-system} machines for the control plane, and you can use either {op-system} or {op-system-base-full} 7.9 or 8.4 for compute machines.
//Removed the note per https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GRPA-3517

//{product-title} 4.6 is an Extended Update Support (EUS) release. More information on Red Hat OpenShift EUS is available in link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#ocp4_phases[OpenShift Life Cycle] and link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift-eus[OpenShift EUS Overview].

With the release of {product-title} 4.9, version 4.6 is now end of life. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy].

[id="ocp-4-9-inclusive-language"]
== Making open source more inclusive

Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties.

As part of that effort, with this release the following changes are in place:

* The link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs[OpenShift Docs GitHub repository] `master` branch has been renamed to `main`.
* We have begun to progressively replace the terminology of "master" with "control plane". You will notice throughout the documentation that we use both terms, with "master" in parenthesis. For example "... the control plane node (also known as the master node)". In a future release, we will update this to be "the control plane node".

[id="ocp-4-9-add-on-support-status"]
== {product-title} layered and dependant component support and compatibility

The scope of support for layered and dependant components of {product-title} changes independently of the {product-title} version. To determine the current support status and compatibility for an add-on, refer to its release notes. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy].

[id="ocp-4-9-new-features-and-enhancements"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

[id="ocp-4-9-rhcos"]
=== {op-system-first}

[id="ocp-4-9-install-ign-removed"]
==== Installation Ignition config is removed upon boot

Nodes installed with the `coreos-installer` program previously retained the installation Ignition config in the `/boot/ignition/config.ign` file. Starting with the {product-title} 4.9 installation image, that file is removed when the node is provisioned. This change does not affect clusters that were installed on previous {product-title} versions because they still use an older bootimage.

[id="ocp-4-9-installation-and-upgrade"]
=== Installation and upgrade

[id="ocp-4-9-installation-ash-upi"]
==== Installing a cluster on Microsoft Azure Stack Hub using user-provisioned infrastructure

{product-title} 4.9 introduces support for installing a cluster on Azure Stack Hub using user-provisioned infrastructure.

You can incorporate example Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates provided by Red Hat to assist in the deployment process, or create your own. You are also free to create the required resources through other methods; the ARM templates are just an example.

//See ../installing/install_azure_stack_hub/installing-azure-stack-hub-user-infra.adoc#installing-azure-stack-hub-user-infra[Installing a cluster on Azure Stack Hub using ARM templates] for details.


[id=ocp-4.9-azure-cidr]
==== Increased size of Azure subnets within the machine CIDR
The {product-title} installation program for Microsoft Azure now creates subnets as large as possible within the machine CIDR. This lets the cluster use a machine CIDR that is appropriately sized to accommodate the number of nodes in the cluster.

[id="ocp-4-9-aws-china-regions"]
==== Support for AWS regions in China
{product-title} {product-version} introduces support for AWS regions in China. You can now install and update {product-title} clusters in the `cn-north-1` (Beijing) and `cn-northwest-1`(Ningxia) regions.

[id="ocp-4-9-notable-technical-changes"]
== Notable technical changes

{product-title} 4.9 introduces the following notable technical changes.

[discrete]
[id="octavia-ovn-nodeport-changes"]
==== Octavia OVN NodePort changes
Previously, on {rh-openstack-first} deployments, opening traffic on NodePorts was constrained to the CIDR of the node's subnet. In order to support LoadBalancer services using the Octavia Open Virtual Network (OVN) provider, the security group rules that allow NodePort traffic to master and worker nodes are now changed to open `0.0.0.0/0`. 

[discrete]
[id="osp-loadbalancer-configuration-changes"]
==== OpenStack Platform LoadBalancer configuration changes
The {rh-openstack-first} cloud provider LoadBalancer configuration now defaults to `use-octavia=True`. An exception to this rule is a deployment with Kuryr, in which case `use-octavia` is set to `false`, because Kuryr handles LoadBalancer services on its own.

// Note: use [discrete] for these sub-headings.

[id="ocp-4-9-known-issues"]
== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.8 and beyond! This needs some SME/QE review before being updated for 4.9.
* In {product-title} 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.
+
If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.1 to 4.8, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. It is recommended to revoke unauthenticated access unless there is a specific need for it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP `403` errors if you revoke unauthenticated access.
====
+
Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:
+
[source,bash]
----
## Snippet to remove unauthenticated group from all the cluster role bindings
$ for clusterrolebinding in cluster-status-binding discovery system:basic-user system:discovery system:openshift:discovery ;
do
### Find the index of unauthenticated group in list of subjects
index=$(oc get clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} -o json | jq 'select(.subjects!=null) | .subjects | map(.name=="system:unauthenticated") | index(true)');
### Remove the element at index from subjects array
oc patch clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} --type=json --patch "[{'op': 'remove','path': '/subjects/$index'}]";
done
----
+
This script removes unauthenticated subjects from the following cluster role bindings:
+
--
** `cluster-status-binding`
** `discovery`
** `system:basic-user`
** `system:discovery`
** `system:openshift:discovery`
--
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821771[*BZ#1821771*])

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.9 and beyond!
* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])

* An Open Virtual Network (OVN) bug causes persistent connectivity issues with Octavia load balancers. When Octavia load balancers are created, OVN might not plug them into some Neutron subnets. These load balancers might be unreachable for some of the Neutron subnets. This problem affects Neutron subnets, which are created for each OpenShift namespace at random when Kuryr is configured. As a result, when this problem occurs the load balancer that implements OpenShift `Service` objects will be unreachable from OpenShift namespaces affected by the issue. Because of this bug, {product-title} 4.8 deployments that use Kuryr SDN are not recommended on {rh-openstack-first} 16.1 with OVN and OVN Octavia configured. This will be fixed in a future release of {rh-openstack}. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1937392[*BZ#1937392*])

* Installations on {rh-openstack-first} with Kuryr will not work if configured with a cluster-wide proxy when the cluster-wide proxy is required to access {rh-openstack} APIs. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1985486[*BZ#1985486*])

* Due to a race condition, the {rh-openstack-first} cloud provider might not start properly. Consequently, LoadBalancer services might never get an `EXTERNAL-IP` set. As a temporary workaround, you can restart the kube-controller-manager pods using the procedure described in link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2004542[*BZ#2004542*]. 


[id="ocp-4-9-asynchronous-errata-updates"]
== Asynchronous errata updates

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for {product-title} 4.9 are released as asynchronous errata through the Red Hat Network. All {product-title} 4.9 errata is https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[available on the Red Hat Customer Portal]. See the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} Life Cycle] for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account settings for Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications are enabled, users are notified via email whenever new errata relevant to their registered systems are released.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming {product-title} entitlements for {product-title} errata notification emails to generate.
====

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of {product-title} 4.9. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form {product-title} 4.9.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any {product-title} release, always review the instructions on xref:../updating/updating-cluster.adoc#updating-cluster[updating your cluster] properly.
