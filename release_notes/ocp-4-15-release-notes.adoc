== About this release

// TODO: Update with the relevant information closer to release.
{product-title} (link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7198[RHSA-2023:7198]) is now available. This release uses link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.28.md[Kubernetes 1.28] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at https://console.redhat.com/openshift. With the {cluster-manager-first} application for {product-title}, you can deploy {product-title} clusters to either on-premises or cloud environments.

// Double check OP system versions
{product-title} {product-version} is supported on {op-system-base-full} 8.8 and 8.9, and on {op-system-first} 4.15.

You must use {op-system} machines for the control plane, and you can use either {op-system} or {op-system-base} for compute machines.
//Removed the note per https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GRPA-3517

For {product-title} 4.12 on `x86_64` architecture, Red Hat has added a 6-month Extended Update Support (EUS) phase that extends the total available lifecycle from 18 months to 24 months. For {product-title} 4.12 running on 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), and {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architectures, the EUS lifecycle remains at 18 months.

Starting with {product-title} 4.14, each EUS phase for even numbered releases on all supported architectures, including `x86_64`, 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), and {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architectures, has a total available lifecycle of 24 months.

Starting with {product-title} 4.14, Red Hat offers a 12-month additional EUS add-on, denoted as _Additional EUS Term 2_, that extends the total available lifecycle from 24 months to 36 months. The Additional EUS Term 2 is available on all architecture variants of {product-title}.

For more information about this support, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

//TODO: The line below should be used when it is next appropriate. Revisit in August 2023 time frame.
Maintenance support ends for version 4.12 on 17 July 2024 and goes to extended update support phase. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

Commencing with the {product-version} release, Red Hat is simplifying the administration and management of Red Hat shipped cluster Operators with the introduction of three new life cycle classifications; Platform Aligned, Platform Agnostic, and Rolling Stream. These life cycle classifications provide additional ease and transparency for cluster administrators to understand the life cycle policies of each Operator and form cluster maintenance and upgrade plans with predictable support boundaries. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/j/includes/session/scribe/?redirectTo=https%3A%2F%2Faccess.redhat.com%2Fsupport%2Fpolicy%2Fupdates%2Fopenshift_operators[OpenShift Operator Life Cycles].

// Added in 4.14. Language came directly from Kirsten Newcomer.
{product-title} is designed for FIPS. When running {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures.

For more information about the NIST validation program, see link:https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules[Cryptographic Module Validation Program]. For the latest NIST status for the individual versions of {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted for validation, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2918071#fips-140-2-and-fips-140-3-2[Compliance Activities and Government Standards].

[id="ocp-4-15-installation-and-update"]
=== Installation and update

[id="ocp-4-15-azure-storage-account-encryption"]
==== Encrypting Azure storage account during installation

You can now encrypt Azure storage accounts during installation by providing the installation program with a customer managed encryption key. See xref:../installing/installing_azure/installation-config-parameters-azure.adoc#installation-configuration-parameters-additional-azure_installation-config-parameters-azure[Installation configuration parameters] for descriptions of the parameters required to encrypt Azure storage accounts.

[id="ocp-4-15-capi-openstack-tech-preview-no-upgrade"]
==== {rh-openstack} integration into the Cluster CAPI Operator (Tech Preview)

If you enable the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature flag, the Cluster CAPI Operator deploys the {cap-openstack-first} and manages its lifecycle.
The Cluster CAPI Operator automatically creates `Cluster` and `OpenStackCluster` resources for the current {product-title} cluster.

It is now possible to configure the Cluster API `Machine` and `OpenStackMachine` resources similarly to how Machine API resources are configured.
It is important to note that while Cluster API resources are functionally equivalent to Machine API resources, structurally they are not identical.

[id="ocp-4-15-installation-and-update-ibm-cloud-user-managed-encryption"]
==== IBM Cloud and user-managed encryption

You can now specify your own {ibm-name} Key Protect for {ibm-cloud-name} root key as part of the installation process. This root key is used to encrypt the root (boot) volume of control plane and compute machines, and the persistent volumes (data volumes) that are provisioned after the cluster is deployed.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_ibm_cloud_public/user-managed-encryption-ibm-cloud.adoc#user-managed-encryption-ibm-cloud[User-managed encryption for IBM Cloud].

[id="ocp-4-15-installation-and-update-ibm-cloud-restricted-install"]
==== Installing a cluster on IBM Cloud with limited internet access

You can now install a cluster on {ibm-cloud-name} in an environment with limited internet access, such as a disconnected or restricted network cluster. With this type of installation, you create a registry that mirrors the contents of the {product-title} installation images. You can create this registry on a mirror host, which can access both the internet and your restricted network.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_ibm_cloud_public/installing-ibm-cloud-restricted.adoc#installing-ibm-cloud-restricted[Installing a cluster on IBM Cloud in a restricted network].

[id="ocp-4-15-ipv6-default-macvlan"]
==== IPv6 unsolicited neighbor advertisements now default on macvlan CNI plugin

Previously, if one pod (`Pod X`) was deleted, and a second pod (`Pod Y`) was created with a similar configuration, `Pod Y` might have had the same IPv6 address as `Pod X`, but it would have a different MAC address. In this scenario, the router was unaware of the MAC address change, and it would continue sending traffic to the MAC address for `Pod X`.

With this update, pods created using the macvlan CNI plugin, where the IP address management CNI plugin has assigned IPs, now send IPv6 unsolicited neighbor advertisements by default onto the network. This enhancement notifies the network fabric of the new pod's MAC address for a particular IP to refresh IPv6 neighbor caches.

Starting with {product-title} 4.14, as a Technology Preview feature, the default storage class is assigned to these PVCs retroactively so that they do not remain in the pending state. After a default storage class is created, or one of the existing storage classes is declared the default, these previously stranded PVCs are assigned to the default storage class.

==== SELinux relabeling using mount options (Technology Preview)
Previously, when SELinux was enabled, the persistent volume's (PV's) files were relabeled when attaching the PV to the pod, potentially causing timeouts when the PVs contained many files, as well as overloading the storage backend.

In {product-title} 4.15, for Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver that support this feature, the driver will mount the volume directly with the correct SELinux labels, eliminating the need to recursively relabel the volume, and pod startup can be significantly faster.

This feature is supported with Technology Preview status.

If the following conditions are true, the feature is enabled by default:

* The CSI driver that provides the volume has support for this feature with `seLinuxMountSupported: true` in its CSIDriver instance. The following CSI drivers that are shipped as part of {product-title} announce SELinux mount support:

[id="ocp-4-15-olmv1"]
==== {olmv1-first} (Technical Preview)

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) has been included with {product-title} 4 since its initial release. {product-title} 4.14 introduced components for a next-generation iteration of OLM as a Technology Preview feature, known during this phase as _{olmv1}_. This updated framework evolves many of the concepts that have been part of previous versions of OLM and adds new capabilities.

During this Technology Preview phase of {olmv1} in {product-title} {product-version}, administrators can explore the following features added to this release:

Support for version ranges::
You can specify a version range by using a comparison string in an Operator or extension's custom resource (CR). If you specify a version range in the CR, {olmv1} installs or updates to the latest version of the Operator that can be resolved within the version range. For more information, see xref:../operators/olm_v1/olmv1-installing-an-operator-from-a-catalog.adoc#olmv1-updating-an-operator_olmv1-installing-operator[Updating an Operator] and xref:../operators/olm_v1/olmv1-installing-an-operator-from-a-catalog.adoc#olmv1-version-range-support_olmv1-installing-operator[Support for version ranges]

Performance improvements in the Catalog API::
The Catalog API now uses an HTTP service to serve catalog content on the cluster. Previously, custom resource definitions (CRDs) were used for this purpose. The change to using an HTTP service to serve catalog content reduces the load on the Kubernetes API server. For more information, see xref:../operators/olm_v1/olmv1-installing-an-operator-from-a-catalog.adoc#olmv1-finding-operators-to-install_olmv1-installing-operator[Finding Operators to install from a catalog].

[id="ocp-4-15-monitoring-new-metrics-server-to-access-metrics-API-technology-preview"]
==== New Metrics Server component to access the Metrics API (Technology Preview)
This release introduces a Technology Preview option to add a Metrics Server component to the in-cluster monitoring stack.
As a Technology Preview feature, Metrics Server is automatically installed instead of Prometheus Adapter if the `FeatureGate` custom resource is configured with the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` option.
If installed, Metrics Server collects resource metrics and exposes them in the `metrics.k8s.io` Metrics API service for use by other tools and APIs.
Using Metrics Server instead of Prometheus Adapter frees the core platform Prometheus stack from handling this functionality.
For more information, see xref:../observability/monitoring/config-map-reference-for-the-cluster-monitoring-operator.adoc#metricsserverconfig[MetricsServerConfig] in the config map API reference for the Cluster Monitoring Operator and xref:../nodes/clusters/nodes-cluster-enabling-features.adoc[Enabling features using feature gates].

[id="ocp-4-15-monitoring-new-feature-to-send-exemplar-data-to-remote-write-storage-for-user-defined-projects"]
==== New feature to send exemplar data to remote write storage for user-defined projects
User-defined projects can now use remote write to send exemplar data scraped by Prometheus to remote storage.
To use this feature, configure remote write using the `sendExemplars` option in the `RemoteWriteSpec` resource.
For more information, see xref:../observability/monitoring/config-map-reference-for-the-cluster-monitoring-operator.adoc#remotewritespec[RemoteWriteSpec] in the config map API reference for the Cluster Monitoring Operator.

[id="ocp-4-15-monitoring-improved-alert-querying-for-user-defined-projects"]
==== Improved alert querying for user-defined projects
Applications in user-defined projects now have API access to query alerts for application namespaces via the rules tenancy port for Thanos Querier.
You can now construct queries that access the `/api/v1/alerts` endpoint via port 9093 for Thanos Querier, provided that the HTTP request contains a `namespace` parameter.
In previous releases, the rules tenancy port for Thanos Querier did not provide API access to the `/api/v1/alerts` endpoint.

[id="ocp-4-15-monitoring-prometheus-updated-to-tolerate-jitters-at-scrape-time"]
==== Prometheus updated to tolerate jitters at scrape time
The default Prometheus configuration in the monitoring stack has been updated so that jitters are tolerated at scrape time.
For monitoring deployments that have shown sub-optimal chunk compression for data storage, this update helps to optimize data compression, thereby reducing the disk space used by the time series database in these deployments.

[id="ocp-4-15-monitoring-improved-staleness-handling-for-the-kubelet-service-monitor"]
==== Improved staleness handling for the kubelet service monitor
Staleness handling for the kubelet service monitor has been improved to ensure that alerts and time aggregations are accurate.
This improved functionality is active by default and makes the dedicated service monitors feature obsolete.
As a result, the dedicated service monitors feature has been disabled and is now deprecated, and setting the `DedicatedServiceMonitors` resource to `enabled` has no effect.

[id="ocp-4-15-monitoring-improved-ability-to-troubleshoot-reports-of-tasks-failing"]
==== Improved ability to troubleshoot reports of tasks failing
The reasons provided when tasks fail in monitoring components are now more granular so that you can more easily pinpoint whether a reported failure originated in components deployed in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace or in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace.
If the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) reports task failures, the following reasons have been added to identify where the failures originated:

* The `PlatformTasksFailed` reason indicates failures that originated in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace.
* The `UserWorkloadTasksFailed` reason indicates failures that originated in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace.

=== Cloud controller manager for Google Cloud Platform

The Kubernetes community plans to deprecate the use of the Kubernetes controller manager to interact with underlying cloud platforms in favor of using cloud controller managers. As a result, there is no plan to add Kubernetes controller manager support for any new cloud platforms.

This release introduces the General Availability of using a cloud controller manager for Google Cloud Platform.

To learn more about the cloud controller manager, see the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller/[Kubernetes Cloud Controller Manager documentation].

To manage the cloud controller manager and cloud node manager deployments and lifecycles, use the Cluster Cloud Controller Manager Operator.

[id="ocp-4-15-planned-psa-restricted-enforcement"]
=== Future restricted enforcement for pod security admission

Currently, pod security violations are shown as warnings in the audit logs without resulting in the rejection of the pod.

Global restricted enforcement for pod security admission is currently planned for the next minor release of {product-title}. When this restricted enforcement is enabled, pods with pod security violations will be rejected.

To prepare for this upcoming change, ensure that your workloads match the pod security admission profile that applies to them. Workloads that are not configured according to the enforced security standards defined globally or at the namespace level will be rejected. The `restricted-v2` SCC admits workloads according to the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#restricted[Restricted] Kubernetes definition.

If you are receiving pod security violations, see the following resources:

* See xref:../authentication/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission.adoc#security-context-constraints-psa-alert-eval_understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission[Identifying pod security violations] for information about how to find which workloads are causing pod security violations.

* See xref:../authentication/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission.adoc#security-context-constraints-psa-synchronization_understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission[About pod security admission synchronization] to understand when pod security admission label synchronization is performed. Pod security admission labels are not synchronized in certain situations, such as the following situations:
** The workload is running in a system-created namespace that is prefixed with `openshift-`.
** The workload is running on a pod that was created directly without a pod controller.

* If necessary, you can set a custom admission profile on the namespace or pod by setting the `pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce` label.

=== Open Virtual Network Infrastructure Controller default range

Previously, the IP address range `168.254.0.0/16` was the default IP address range that the Open Virtual Network Infrastructure Controller used for the transit switch subnet. With this update, the Controller uses `100.88.0.0/16` as the default IP address range. Do not use this IP range in your production infrastructure network.

[id="ocp-4-15-no-strict-limits-variable"]
=== Introduction of HAProxy no strict-limits variable

The transition to HAProxy 2.6 included enforcement for the `strict-limits` configuration, which resulted in unrecoverable errors when `maxConnections` requirements could not be met. The `strict-limits` setting is not configurable by end users and remains under the control of the HAProxy template.

This release introduces a configuration adjustment in response to the migration to the `maxConnections` issues. Now, the HAProxy configuration switches to using `no strict-limits`. As a result, HAProxy no longer fatally exits when the `maxConnection` configuration cannot be satisfied. Instead, it emits warnings and continues running. When `maxConnection` limitations cannot be met, warnings such as the following examples might be returned:

* `[WARNING] (50) : [/usr/sbin/haproxy.main()] Cannot raise FD limit to 4000237, limit is 1048576.`
* `[ALERT] (50) : [/usr/sbin/haproxy.main()] FD limit (1048576) too low for maxconn=2000000/maxsock=4000237. Please raise 'ulimit-n' to 4000237 or more to avoid any trouble.`

To resolve these warnings, we recommend specifying `-1` or `auto` for the `maxConnections` field when tuning an IngressController. This choice allows HAProxy to dynamically calculate the maximum value based on the available resource limitations in the running container, which eliminates these warnings.

OpenShift SDN CNI is deprecated as of {product-title} 4.14. As of {product-title} {product-version}, the network plugin is not an option for new installations. In a subsequent future release, the OpenShift SDN network plugin is planned to be removed and no longer supported. Red{nbsp}Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this feature until it is removed, but this feature will no longer receive enhancements. As an alternative to OpenShift SDN CNI, you can use OVN Kubernetes CNI instead.

==== Bare Metal Event Relay Operator

The Bare Metal Event Relay Operator is deprecated. The ability to monitor bare-metal hosts by using the Bare Metal Event Relay Operator will be removed in a future {product-title} release.

[id="ocp-4-15-deprecation-sbo"]
==== Service Binding Operator

The Service Binding Operator is deprecated and will be removed with the {product-title} 4.16 release. Red Hat will provide critical bug fixes and support for this component during the current release lifecycle, but this component will no longer receive feature enhancements.

[id="ocp-4-15-dedicated-service-monitors-for-core-platform-monitoring"]
==== Dedicated service monitors for core platform monitoring
With this release, the dedicated service monitors feature for core platform monitoring is deprecated.
The ability to enable dedicated service monitors by configuring the `dedicatedServiceMonitors` setting in the `cluster-monitoring-config` config map object in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace will be removed in a future {product-title} release.
To replace this feature, Prometheus functionality has been improved to ensure that alerts and time aggregations are accurate.
This improved functionality is active by default and makes the dedicated service monitors feature obsolete.

[id="ocp-4-15-prometheus-adapter-for-core-platform-monitoring"]
==== Prometheus Adapter for core platform monitoring
With this release, the Prometheus Adapter component for core platform monitoring is deprecated and is planned to be removed in a future release.
Red{nbsp}Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this component during the current release lifecycle, but this component will no longer receive enhancements and will be removed.
As a replacement, a new Metrics Server component has been added to the monitoring stack.
Metrics Server is a simpler and more lightweight solution because it does not rely on Prometheus for its functionality.
Metrics Server also ensures scalability and a more accurate tracking of resource metrics.
With this release, the improved functionality of Metrics Server is available by default if you enable the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` option in the `FeatureGate` custom resource.

==== API Server and Authentication

* Previously, the `termination.log` in the kube-apiserver log folder had invalid permissions due to settings in the upstream library. With this release, the upstream library was updated and the `terminate.log` now has the expected permissions. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-11856[*OCPBUGS-11856*])

* Previously, the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) enabled a capability if the existing manifest got the capability annotation after an upgrade. This caused the console to be enabled after upgrading to {product-title} 4.14 for users who had previously disabled the console capability. With this release, the unnecessary console capability was removed from the existing manifest and the console capability is no longer implicitly enabled. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-20331[*OCPBUGS-20331*])

* Previously, when the `openshift-kube-controller-manager` namespace was deleted, the following error was logged repeatedly: `failed to synchronize namespace`. With this release, the error is no longer logged when the `openshift-kube-controller-manager` namespace is deleted. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-17458[*OCPBUGS-17458*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-15-bare-metal-hardware-bug-fixes"]
==== Bare Metal Hardware Provisioning

* Previously, deploying IPv6-only hosts from a dual-stack {ztp} hub prevented the correct callback URL from being passed to the baseboard management controller (BMC). Consequently, an IPv4 URL was passed unconditionally. This issue has been resolved, and the IP version of the URL now depends on the IP version of the BMC address. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-23759[*OCPBUGS-23759*])

* Previously, the Bare Metal Operator (BMO) container had a `hostPort` specified as `60000`, but the `hostPort` was not actually in use despite the specification. As a result, other services could not use port 60000. This fix removes the `hostPort` specification from the container configuration. Now, port 60000 is available for use by other services. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18788[*OCPBUGS-18788*])

* Previously, the Cluster Baremetal Operator (CBO) failed when it checked the infrastructure `platformStatus` field and returned `nil`. With {product-title} {product-version}, the CBO has been updated so that it checks and returns a blank value when `apiServerInternalIPs` returns `nil`, which resolves this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-17589[*OCPBUGS-17589*])

* Previously, the `inspector.ipxe` configuration used the `IRONIC_IP` variable, which did not account for IPv6 addresses because they have brackets. Consequently, when the user supplied an incorrect `boot_mac_address`, iPXE fell back to the `inspector.ipxe` configuration, which supplied a malformed IPv6 host header since it did not contain brackets.
+
With {product-title} {product-version}, the `inspector.ipxe` configuration has been updated to use the `IRONIC_URL_HOST` variable, which accounts for IPv6 addresses and resolves the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-27060[*OCPBUGS-27060*])

* Previously, there was a bug when attempting to deploy {product-title} on a new bare metal host using RedFish Virtual Media with Cisco UCS hardware. This bug blocked bare metal hosts from new provisions, because Ironic was unable to find a suitable virtual media device. With this update, Ironic does more checks in all available virtual media devices. As a result, Cisco UCS hardware can now be provisioned when using RedFish Virtual Media. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-23105[*OCPBUGS-23105*])

* Previously, when installing {product-title} with the `bootMode` field set to `UEFISecureBoot` on a node where the `secureBoot` field was set to `disabled`, the installation program failed to start. With this update, Ironic has been updated so that you can install {product-title} with `secureBoot` set to `enabled`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-9303[*OCPBUGS-9303*])

* Previously, timestamps were not preserved when copying contents between containers. With this release, the `-p` flag is added to the `cp` command to allow timestamps to be preserved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-22497[*OCPBUGS-22497*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-15-cloud-compute-bug-fixes"]
==== Cloud Compute

* Previously, an error in the parsing of taints from the `MachineSet` spec meant that the autoscaler could not account for any taint set directly on the spec. Consequently, when relying on the `MachineSet` taints for scaling from zero, the taints from the spec were not considered, which could cause incorrect scaling decisions. With this update, parsing issues within the scale from zero logic have been resolved. As a result, auto scaler can now scale up correctly and identify taints that would prevent workloads from scheduling. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-27750[*OCPBUGS-27750*])

* Previously, an Amazon Web Services (AWS) code that provided image credentials was removed from the kubelet in {product-title} 4.14. Consequently, pulling images from Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) failed without a specified pull secret, because the kubelet could no longer authenticate itself and pass credentials to the container runtime. With this update, a separate credential provider has been configured, which is now responsible for providing ECR credentials for the kubelet. As a result, the kubelet can now pull private images from ECR. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-27486[*OCPBUGS-27486*])

* Previously when deploying a hosted control plane (HCP) KubeVirt cluster the `--node-selector` command, the node selector was not applied to the `kubevirt-cloud-controller-manager` pods within the HCP namespace. Consequentially, you could not pin the entire HCP pods to specific nodes. With this update, this issue has been fixed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-27071[*OCPBUGS-27071*])

* Previously, the default virtual machine (VM) type for the Microsoft Azure load balancer was changed from `Standard` to `VMSS`. Consequently, the service type load balancer could not attach standard VMs to load balancers. This update reverts these changes to the previous configuration to maintain compatibility with {product-title} deployments. As a result, load balancer attachments are now more consistent. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-26210[*OCPBUGS-26210*])

* Previously, deployments on {rh-openstack} nodes with additional ports with the `enable_port_security` field set to `false` were prevented from creating `LoadBalancer` services. With this update, this issue is resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-22246[*OCPBUGS-22246*])

* Previously worker nodes on {rh-openstack-first} were named with domain components if the Nova metadata service was unavailable the first time the worker nodes booted. {product-title} expects the node names to be the same as the Nova instance. The name discrepancy caused the nodes' certificate request to be rejected and the nodes could not join the cluster. With this update, the worker nodes will wait and retry the metadata service indefinitely on first boot ensuring the nodes are correctly named. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-22200[*OCPBUGS-22200*])

* Previously, the cluster autoscaler crashed when used with nodes that have Container Storage Interface (CSI) storage. The issue is resolved in this release. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-23096[*OCPBUGS-23096*])

* Previously, in certain proxied environments, the Amazon Web Services (AWS) metadata service might not have been present on initial startup, and might have only been available shortly after startup. The kubelet hostname fetching did not account for this delay and, consequently, the node would fail to boot because it would not have a valid hostname. This update ensures that the hostname fetching script retries on failure for some time. As a result, inaccessibility of the metadata service is tolerated for a short period of time. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-20369[*OCPBUGS-20369*])

* In {product-title} version 4.14 and later, there is a known issue that causes installation of Microsoft Azure Stack Hub to fail. Microsoft Azure Stack Hub clusters that are upgraded to 4.14 or later might encounter load balancer configuration issues as nodes scale up or down. Installing or upgrading to 4.14 in Microsoft Azure Stack Hub environments is not recommended until this issue is resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-20213[*OCPBUGS-20213*])

* Previously, some conditions during the startup process of the Cluster Autoscaler Operator caused a lock that prevented the Operator from successfully starting and marking itself available. As a result, the cluster became degraded. The issue is resolved with this release. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18954[*OCPBUGS-18954*])

* Previously, attempting to perform a Google Cloud Platform XPN internal cluster installation failed when control nodes were added to a second internal instance group. This bug has been fixed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5755[*OCPBUGS-5755*])

* Previously, the termination handler prematurely exited before marking a node for termination. This condition occurred based on the timing of when the termination signal was received by the controller. With this release, the possibility of early termination is accounted for by introducing an additional check for termination. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2117[*OCPBUGS-2117*])

* Previously, when the `Build` cluster capability was not enabled, the cluster version Operator (CVO) failed to synchronize the build informer, and did not start successfully. With this release, the CVO successfully starts when the `Build` capability is not enabled. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-22956[*OCPBUGS-22956*])

==== Cloud Credential Operator

* Previously, the Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`) created custom GCP roles at the cluster level, so each cluster contributed to the quota limit on the number of allowed custom roles. Because of GCP deletion policies, deleted custom roles continue to contribute to the quota limit for many days after they are deleted. With this release, custom roles are added at the project level instead of the cluster level to reduce the total number of custom roles created. Additionally, an option to clean up custom roles is now available when deleting the GCP resources that the `ccoctl` utility creates during installation. These changes can help avoid reaching the quota limit on the number of allowed custom roles. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-28850[*OCPBUGS-28850*])

* Previously, when the `Build` cluster capability was not enabled, the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) failed to synchronize the build informer and did not start successfully. With this release, the CVO successfully starts when the `Build` capability is not enabled. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-26510[*OCPBUGS-26510*])

* Previously, buckets created by running the `ccoctl azure create` command were prohibited from allowing public blob access due to a change in the default behavior of Microsoft Azure buckets. With this release, buckets created by running the `ccoctl azure create` command are explicitly set to allow public blob access. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-22369[*OCPBUGS-22369*])

* Previously, an Azure Managed Identity role was omitted from the Cloud Controller Manager service account. As a result, the Cloud Controller Manager could not manage service type load balancers in environments deployed to existing VNets with a private publishing method. With this release, the missing role was added to the Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`) and Azure Managed Identity installations into an existing VNet with private publishing is possible. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-21745[*OCPBUGS-21745*])

* Previously, the Cloud Credential Operator did not support updating the vCenter server value in the root secret `vshpere-creds` that is stored in the `kube-system` namespace. As a result, attempting to update this value caused both the old and new values to exist because the component secrets were not synchronized correctly. With this release, the Cloud Credential Operator resets the secret data during synchronization so that updating the vCenter server value is supported. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-20478[*OCPBUGS-20478*])

* Previously, the Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`) failed to create AWS Security Token Service (STS) resources in China regions because the China region DNS suffix `.amazonaws.com.cn` differs from the suffix `.amazonaws.com` that is used in other regions. With this release, `ccoctl` can detect the correct DNS suffix and use it to create the required resources. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-13597[*OCPBUGS-13597*])

==== Cluster Version Operator

* The Cluster Version Operator (CVO) continually retrieves update recommendations and evaluates known conditional update risks against the current cluster state. Previously, failing risk evaluations blocked the CVO from fetching new update recommendations. When the risk evaluations were failing because the update recommendation service served a poorly-defined update risk, this issue could prevent the CVO from noticing the update recommendation service serving an improved risk declaration. With this release, the CVO continues to poll the update recommendation service regardless of whether update risks are successfully evaluated or not.

* Previously, the console searched only for the file name `Dockerfile` in a repository to identify the repository suitable for the `Container` strategy in the Import Flows. Since other containerization tools are available, support for the `Containerfile` file name is now suitable for the `Container` strategy. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-22976[*OCPBUGS-22976*])

* Previously, when an unauthorized user opened a link to the console that contains path and query parameters, and they were redirected to a login page, the query parameters did not restore after the login was successful. As a result, the user needed to restore the search or click the link to the console again. With this update, the latest version saves and restores the query parameters similar to the path. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-22199[*OCPBUGS-22199*])

* Previously, when using a custom Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin in a hosted cluster, role-based access control (RBAC) rules were configured only when you set the `hostedcluster.spec.networking.networkType` field to `Calico`. Role-based access control (RBAC) rules were not configured when you set the `hostedcluster.spec.networking.networkType` field to `Other`.

(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-28235[*OCPBUGS-28235*])

* Previously, a node port failed to expose properly because the `ipFamilyPolicy` field was set to `SingleStack` for the `kube-apiserver` resource. With this update, if the `ipFamilyPolicy` is set to `PreferredDualStack`, node port is exposed properly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-23350[*OCPBUGS-23350*])

* Previously, after configuring the Open Virtual Network (OVN) for a hosted cluster, the `cloud-network-config-controller`, `multus-admission-controller`, and`ovnkube-control-plane` resources were missing the `hypershift.openshift.io/hosted-control-plane:{hostedcluster resource namespace}-{cluster-name}` label. With this update, after configuring the Open Virtual Network (OVN) for a hosted cluster, the `cloud-network-config-controller`, `multus-admission-controller`, and`ovnkube-control-plane` resources contain the `hypershift.openshift.io/hosted-control-plane:{hostedcluster resource namespace}-{cluster-name}` label.

With this update, you can use unique names to create a config map. The CPO is deployed successfully. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-19419[*OCPBUGS-19419*])

* Previously, hosted clusters with `.status.controlPlaneEndpoint.port: 443` would mistakenly expose port 6443 for public and private routers. With this update, hosted clusters with `.status.controlPlaneEndpoint.port: 443` only expose the port 443. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-20161[*OCPBUGS-20161*])

* Previously, if the Kube API server is exposed by using IPv4 and IPv6, and the IP address is set in the `HostedCluster` resource, the IPv6 environment did not work properly. With this update, when the Kube API server is exposed by using IPv4 and IPv6, the IPv6 environment works properly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-20246[*OCPBUGS-20246*])

[id="ocp-4-15-image-registry-bug-fixes"]
==== Image Registry

* Previously, the Image Registry pruner relied on a cluster role that was managed by the OpenShift API server. This could cause the pruner job to intermittently fail during an upgrade. Now, the Image Registry Operator is responsible for creating the pruner cluster role, which resolves the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18969[*OCPBUGS-18969*])

* The Image Registry Operator makes API calls to the storage account list endpoint as part of obtaining access keys. In projects with several {product-title} clusters, this might lead to API limits being reached. As a result, `429` errors were returned when attempting to create new clusters. With this update, the time between calls has been increased from 5 minutes to 20 minutes, and API limits are no longer reached. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18469[*OCPBUGS-18469*])

* Previously, the default low settings for QPS and Burst caused the image registry to return with a gateway timeout error when API server requests were not returned in an appropriate time. To resolve this issue, users had to restart the image registry. With this update, the default settings for QPS and Burst have been increased, and this issue no longer occurs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18999[*OCPBUGS-18999*])

* Previously, when creating the deployment resource for the Cluster Image Registry Operator, error handling used a pointer variable without checking if the value was `nil` first. Consequently, when the pointer value was `nil`, a panic was reported in the logs. With this update, a nil check was added so that the panic is no longer reported in the logs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18103[*OCPBUGS-18103*])

* Previously, the {product-title} 4.14 release introduced a change that gave users the perception that their images were lost when updating from {product-title} version 4.13 to 4.14. A change to the default internal registry caused the registry to use an incorrect path when using the Microsoft Azure object storage. With this release, the correct path is used and a job has been added to the registry operator that moves any blobs pushed to the registry that used the wrong storage path into the correct storage path, which effectively merges the two distinct storage paths into a single path.
+
[NOTE]
====
This fix does *not* work on Azure Stack Hub (ASH). ASH users who used OCP versions 4.14.0 through 4.14.13 when upgrading to 4.14.14+ will need to execute manual steps to move their blobs to the correct storage path.

==== Installer

* Previously, installing a cluster on AWS might fail in some cases due to a validation error. With this update, the installation program produces the necessary cloud configuration object to satisfy the machine config operator. This results in the installation succeeding. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-12707[*OCPBUGS-12707*])

* Previously, installing a cluster on GCP using a service account attached to a VM for authentication might fail due to an internal data validation bug. With this release, the installation program has been updated to correctly validate the authentication parameters when using a service account attached to a VM. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-19376[*OCPBUGS-19376*])

* Previously, the vSphere connection configuration interface showed the network name instead of the cluster name in the "vCenter cluster" field. With this update, the "vCenter cluster" field has been updated to display the cluster name. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-23347[*OCPBUGS-23347*])

* Previously, when you authenticated with the `credentialsMode` parameter not set to `Manual` and you used the `gcloud cli` tool, the installation program retrieved Google Cloud Platform (GCP) credentials from the `osServiceAccount.json` file. This operation caused the GCP cluster installation to fail. Now, a validation check scans the `install-config.yaml` file and prompts you with a message if you did not set `credentialsMode` to `Manual`. Note that in `Manual` mode, you must edit the manifests and provide the credentials. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-17757[*OCPBUGS-17757*])

* Previously when you attempted to install an {product-title} on VMware vSphere by using installer-provisioned infrastructure, a resource pool object would include a double backslash. This format caused the installation program to generate an incorrect path to network resources that in turn caused the installation operation to fail. After the installation program processed this resource pool object, the program outputted a "network not found" error message. Now, the installation program retrieves the cluster object for the purposes of joining the InventoryPath with the network name so that the program specifies the correct path to the resource pool object. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-23376[*OCPBUGS-23376*])

* Previously, after installing an Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster, some cluster Operators were unavailable. This was the result of one of the cluster’s load balancers not being created as part of the installation process. With this update, the load balancer is correctly created. After installing a cluster, all cluster Operators are available. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-24191[*OCPBUGS-24191*])

* Previously, if the VMware vSphere cluster contained an ESXi host that was offline, the installation failed with a "panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference" message. With this update, the error message states that the ESXi host is unavailable. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-20350[*OCPBUGS-20350*])

* Previously, if you only used the default machine configuration to specify existing AWS security groups when installing a cluster on AWS (`platform.aws.defaultMachinePlatform.additonalSecurityGroupsIDs`), the security groups were not applied to control plane machines. With this update, existing AWS security groups are correctly applied to control planes when they are specified using the default machine configuration. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-20525[*OCPBUGS-20525*])

* Previously, installing a cluster on AWS failed when the specified machine instance type (`platform.aws.type`) did not support the machine architecture that was specified for control plane or compute machines (`controlPlane.architecture` and `compute.architecture`). With this update, the installation program now checks to determine if the machine instance type supports the specified architecture and displays an error message if it does not. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-26051[*OCPBUGS-26051*])

* Previously, the installation program did not validate some configuration settings before installing the cluster. This behavior occurred when these settings were only specified in the default machine configuration (`platform.azure.defaultMachinePlatform`). As a result, the installation would succeed even if the following conditions were met:
+
** An unsupported machine instance type was specified.
** Additional functionality, such as accelerated networking or the use of Azure ultra disks, was not supported by the specified machine instance type.

+
With this fix, the installation program now displays an error message that specifies the unsupported configuration. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-20364[*OCPBUGS-20364*])

* Previously, when installing an AWS cluster to the Secret Commercial Cloud Services (SC2S) region and specifying existing AWS security groups, the installation failed with an error that stated that the functionality was not available in the region. With this fix, the installation succeeds. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18830[*OCPBUGS-18830*])

* Previously, when you specified Key Management Service (KMS) encryption keys in the `kmsKeyARN` section of the `install-config.yaml` configuration file for installing a cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS), permission roles were not added during the cluster installation operation. With this update, after you specify the keys in the configuration file, an additional set of keys are added to the cluster so that the cluster successfully installs. If you specify the `credentialsMode` parameter in the configuration file, all KMS encryption keys are ignored. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-13664[*OCPBUGS-13664*])

* Previously, Agent-based installations on {oci-first} did not show a console displaying installation progress to users, making it more difficult to track installation progress. With this update, Agent-based installations on {oci} now display installation progress on the console. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-19092[*OCPBUGS-19092*])

* Previously, if static networking was defined in the `install-config.yaml` or `agent-config.yaml` files for the Agent-based Installer, and an interface name was over 15 characters long, the network manager did not allow the interface to come up. With this update, interface names longer than 15 characters are truncated and the installation can proceed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18552[*OCPBUGS-18552*])

* Previously, if the user did not specify the `rendezevousIP` field in the `agent-config.yaml` file and hosts were defined in the same file with static network configuration, then the first host was designated as a rendezvous node regardless of its role. This caused the installation to fail.
With this update, the Agent-based Installer prioritizes the rendezvous node search by first looking among the hosts with a `master` role and a static IP defined. If none is found, then a potential candidate is searched for through the hosts that do not have a role defined. Hosts with a static network configuration that are explicitly configured with a `worker` role are ignored. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5471[*OCPBUGS-5471*])

* Previously, the Agent console application was shown during the boot process of all Agent-based installations, enabling network customizations before proceeding with the installation. Because network configuration is rarely needed during cloud installations, this would unnecessarily slow down installations on {oci-first}.
+
With this update, Agent-based installations on {oci} no longer show the Agent console application and proceed more quickly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-19093[*OCPBUGS-19093*])

* Previously, the Agent-based Installer enabled an external Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) by default when the platform was defined as `external`. This prevented users from disabling the external CCM when performing installations on cloud platforms that do not require one. With this update, users are required to enable an external CCM only when performing an Agent-based installation on {oci-first}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18455[*OCPBUGS-18455*])

* Previously, the `agent wait-for` command failed to record logs in the `.openshift_install.log` file. With this update, logs are recorded in the `.openshift_install.log` file when you use the `agent wait-for` command. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5728[*OCPBUGS-5728*])

* Previously, the `assisted-service` on the bootstrap machine became unavailable after the bootstrap node rebooted, preventing any communication from the `assisted-installer-controller`. This stopped the `assisted-installer-controller` from removing uninitialized taints from worker nodes, causing the cluster installation to hang waiting on cluster Operators.
+
With this update, the `assisted-installer-controller` can remove the uninitialized taints even if `assisted-service` becomes unavailable, and the installation can proceed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-20049[*OCPBUGS-20049*])

* Previously, the platform type was erroneously required to be lowercase in the `AgentClusterInstall` cluster manifest used by the Agent-based Installer. With this update, mixed case values are required, but the original lowercase values are now accepted and correctly translated. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-19444[*OCPBUGS-19444*])

* Previously, the `manila-csi-driver-controller-metrics` service had empty endpoints due to an incorrect name for the app selector. With this release the app selector name is changed to `openstack-manila-csi` and the issue is fixed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-9331[*OCPBUGS-9331*])

* Previously, the assisted installer removed the uninitialized taints for all vSphere nodes which prevented the vSphere CCM from initializing the nodes properly. This caused the vSphere CSI operator to degrade during the initial cluster installation because the node's provider ID was missing. With this release, the assisted installer checks if vSphere credentials were provided in the `install-config.yaml`. If credentials were provided, the OpenShift version is greater or equal to 4.15, and the agent installer was used, the assisted-installer and assisted-installer-controller do not remove the uninitialized taints. This means that the node's providerID and VM's UUID are properly set and the vSphere CSI operator is installed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29485[*OCPBUGS-29485*])

* Previously, when the `maxSurge` field was set for a daemon set and the toleration was updated, pods failed to scale down, which resulted in a failed rollout due to a different set of nodes being used for scheduling. With this release, nodes are properly excluded if scheduling constraints are not met, and rollouts can complete successfully. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-19452[*OCPBUGS-19452*])

==== Machine Config Operator

* Previously, a misspelled environment variable prevented a script from detecting that the `node.env` file was present. This caused the contents of the `node.env` file to be overwritten after each boot, and the kubelet hostname could not be changed. With this update, the environment variable spelling is corrected and edits to the `node.env` file persist across reboots. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-27307[*OCPBUGS-27307*])

* Previously, the Machine Config Operator allowed user-provided certificate authority updates to be made without requiring a new machine config to trigger. Because the new write method for these updates was missing a newline character, it caused validation errors for the contents of the CA file on-disk and the Machine Config Daemon became degraded. With this release, the CA file contents are fixed, and updates proceed as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-25424[*OCPBUGS-25424*])

* Previously, the Machine Config Operator allowed user-provided certificate authority bundle changes to be applied to the cluster without needing a machine config, to prevent disruption. Because of this, the `user-ca` bundle was not propagating to applications running on the cluster and required a reboot to see the changes take effect. With this update, the MCO now runs the `update-ca-trust` command and restarts the CRI-O service so that the new CA properly applies. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-24035[*OCPBUGS-24035*])

* Previously, the initial mechanism used by the Machine Config Operator to handle image registry certs would delete and create new config maps rather than patching existing ones. This caused a significant increase in API usage from the MCO. With this update, the mechanism has been updated so that it uses a JSON patch instead, thereby resolving the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18800[*OCPBUGS-18800*])

* Previously, the Machine Config Operator was pulling the `baremetalRuntimeCfgImage` container image multiple times: the first time to obtain node details and subsequent times to verify that the image is available. This caused issues during certificate rotation in situations where the mirror server or Quay was not available, and subsequent image pulls would fail. However, if the image is already on the nodes due to the first image pull then the nodes should start the kubelet regardless. With this update, the `baremetalRuntimeCfgImage` image is only pulled one time, thereby resolving the issue. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18772[*OCPBUGS-18772*])

* Previously, the `nmstatectl` command failed to retrieve the correct permanent MAC address during {product-title} updates for some network environments. This caused the interface to be renamed and the bond connection on the node to break during the update. With this release, patches were applied to the `nmstate` package and MCO to prevent renaming, and updates proceed as expected. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-17877[*OCPBUGS-17877*])

* Previously, the Machine Config Operator became the default provider of image registry certificates and the `node-ca` daemon was removed. This caused issues with the HyperShift Operator, because removing the `node-ca` daemon also removed the image registry path in the Machine Config Server (MCS), which HyperShift uses to get the Ignition configuration and start the bootstrap process. With this update, a flag containing the MCS image registry data is provided, which Ignition can use during the bootstrap process, thereby resolving the issue. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-17811[*OCPBUGS-17811*])

* Previously, older {op-system} boot images contained a race condition between services on boot that prevented the node from running the `rhcos-growpart` command before it pulled images, preventing the node from starting up. This caused node scaling to sometimes fail on clusters that use old boot images because it was determined there was no room left on the disk. With this update, processes were added to the Machine Config Operator for stricter ordering of services so that nodes boot correctly.
+
[NOTE]
====
In these situations, updating to newer boot images prevents similar issues from occurring.

(https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-15087[*OCPBUGS-15087*])

* Previously, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) leveraged the `oc image extract` command to pull images during updates but the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` (ICSP) object was not respected when pulling those images. With this update, the MCO now uses the `podman pull` command internally and images are pulled from the location as configured in the ICSP.

[id="ocp-4-15-management-console-bug-fixes"]
==== Management Console

* Previously, the *Expand PVC* modal assumed the existing PVC had a `spec.resources.requests.storage` value that includes a unit. As a result, when the *Expand PVC* modal was used to expand a PVC that had a `requests.storage` value without a unit, the console would display an incorrect value in the modal. With this update, the console was updated to handle storage values with and without a unit. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-27909[*OCPBUGS-27909*])

* Previously, the console check to determine if a file is binary was not robust enough. As a result, XML files were misidentified as binary and not displaying in the console. With this update, an additional check was added to more precisely check if a file is binary. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-26591[*OCPBUGS-26591*])

* Previously, the *Node Overview* page failed to render when a `MachineHealthCheck` without `spec.unhealthyConditions` existed on a cluster. With this update, the *Node Overview* page was updated to allow for `MachineHealthChecks` without `spec.unhealthyConditions`. Now, the *Node Overview* page renders even if `MachineHealthChecks` without `spec.unhealthyConditions` are present on the cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-25140[*OCPBUGS-25140*])

* Previously, the console was not up-to-date with the newest matchers key for alert notification receivers, and the alert manager receivers created by the console utilized the older match key. With this update, the console uses matchers instead, and converts any existing match instances to matchers when modifying an existing alert manager receiver. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-23248[*OCPBUGS-23248*])

* Previously, impersonation access was incorrectly applied. With this update, the console correctly applies impersonation access. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-23125[*OCPBUGS-23125*])

* Previously, when the Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (ACM) and multicluster engine for Kubernetes (MCE) Operators are installed and their plugins are enabled, the YAML code Monaco editor failed to load.
With this update, optional resource chaining was added to prevent a failed resource call, and the YAML editor no longer fails to load when the ACM and MCE Operators are installed and their plugins enabled. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-22778[*OCPBUGS-22778*])

[id="ocp-4-15-monitoring-bug-fixes"]
==== Monitoring

* Previously, the monitoring-plugin component did not start if IPv6 was disabled for a cluster. This release updates the component to support the following internet protocol configurations in a cluster: IPv4 only, IPv6 only, and both IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously. This change resolves the issue, and the monitoring-plugin component now starts up if the cluster is configured to support only IPv6. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-21610[*OCPBUGS-21610*])

* Previously, instances of Alertmanager for core platform monitoring and for user-defined projects could inadvertently become peered during an upgrade. This issue could occur when multiple Alertmanager instances were deployed in the same cluster. This release fixes the issue by adding a `--cluster.label` flag to Alertmanager that helps to block any traffic that is not intended for the cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18707[*OCPBUGS-18707*])

* Previously, it was not possible to use text-only email templates in an Alertmanager configuration to send text-only email alerts. With this update, you can configure Alertmanager to send text-only email alerts by setting the `html` field of the email receiver to an empty string.

[id="ocp-4-15-networking-bug-fixes"]
==== Networking

* Previously, when creating an IngressController with an empty spec, the IngressController's status showed `Invalid`. However, the `route_controller_metrics_routes_per_shard` metric would still get created. When the invalid IngressController was deleted, the `route_controller_metrics_routes_per_shard` metric would not clear, and it would show information for that metric. With this update, metrics are only created for IngressControllers that are admitted, which resolves this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3541[*OCPBUGS-3541*])

* Previously, timeout values larger than what Go programming language could parse were not properly validated. Consequently, timeout values larger than what HAProxy could parse caused issues with HAProxy. With this update, if the timeout specifies a value larger than what can be parsed, it is capped at the maximum that HAProxy can parse. As a result, issues are no longer caused for HAProxy. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-6959[*OCPBUGS-6959*])

* Previously, an external neighbor could have its MAC address changed while the cluster was shutting down or hibernating. Although a Gratuitous Address Resolution Protocol (GARP) should notify other neighbors about this change, the cluster would not process the GARP because it was not running. When the cluster was brought back up, that neighbor might not be reachable from the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network because the stale MAC address was being used. This update enables an aging mechanism so that a neighbor's MAC address is periodically refreshed every 300 seconds. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-11710[*OCPBUGS-11710*])

* Previously, when an IngressController was configured with SSL/TLS, but did not have the `clientca-configmap` finalizer, the Ingress Operator would try to add the finalizer without checking whether the IngressController was marked for deletion. Consequently, if an IngressController was configured with SSL/TLS and was subsequently deleted, the Operator would correctly remove the finalizer. It would then repeatedly, and erroneously, try and fail to update the IngressController to add the finalizer back, resulting in error messages in the Operator's logs.
+
With this update, the Ingress Operator no longer adds the `clientca-configmap` finalizer to an IngressController that is marked for deletion. As a result, the Ingress Operator no longer tries to perform erroneous updates, and no longer logs the associated errors. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-14994[*OCPBUGS-14994*])

* Previously, a race condition occurred between the handling of pods that had been scheduled and the pods that had been completed on a node when OVN-Kubernetes started. This condition often occurred when nodes rebooted. Consequently, the same IP was erroneously assigned to multiple pods. This update fixes the race condition so that the same IP is not assigned to multiple pods in those circumstances. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-16634[*OCPBUGS-16634*])

* Previously, there was an error that caused a route to be rejected due to a duplicate host claim. When this occurred, the system would mistakenly select the first route it encountered, which was not always the conflicting route. With this update, all routes for the conflicting host are first retrieved and then sorted based on their submission time. This allows the system to accurately determine and select the newest conflicting route. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-16707[*OCPBUGS-16707*])

* Previously, when a new `ipspec-host` pod was started, it would clear or remove the existing `XFRM` state. Consequently, it would remove existing north-south traffic policies. This issue has been resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-19817[*OCPBUGS-19817*])

* Previously, the `ovn-k8s-cni-overlay, topology:layer2` NetworkAttachmentDefinition did not work in a hosted pod when using the Kubevirt provider. Consequently, the pod did not start. This issue has been resolved, and pods can now start with an `ovn-k8s-cni-overlay` NetworkAttachmentDefinition. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-22869[*OCPBUGS-22869*])

* Previously, the Azure upstream DNS did not comply with non-EDNS DNS queries because it returned a payload larger than 512 bytes. Because CoreDNS 1.10.1 no longer uses EDNS for upstream queries and only uses EDNS when the original client query uses EDNS, the combination would result in an overflow `servfail` error when the upstream returned a payload larger than 512 bytes for non-EDNS queries using CoreDNS 1.10.1. Consequently, upgrading from {product-title} 4.12 to 4.13 led to some DNS queries failing that previously worked.
+
With this release, instead of returning an overflow `servfail` error, the CoreDNS now truncates the response, indicating that the client can try again in TCP. As a result, clusters with a noncompliant upstream now retry with TCP when experiencing overflow errors. This prevents any disruption of functionality between {product-title} 4.12 and 4.13. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-27904[*OCPBUGS-27904*]), (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-28205[*OCPBUGS-28205*])

* Previously, there was a limitation in private Microsoft Azure clusters where secondary IP addresses designated as egress IP addresses lacked outbound connectivity. This meant that pods associated with these IP addresses were unable to access the internet. However, they could still reach external servers within the infrastructure network, which is the intended use case for egress IP addresses. This update enables egress IP addresses for Microsoft Azure clusters, allowing outbound connectivity to be achieved through outbound rules. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5491[*OCPBUGS-5491*])

* Previously, when using multiple NICS, egress IP addresses were not correctly reassigned to the correct egress node when labeled or unlabeled. This bug has been fixed, and egress IP addresses are now reassigned to the correct egress node. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18162[*OCPBUGS-18162*])

* Previously, a new logic introduced for determining where to run the Keepalived process did not consider the ingress VIP or VIPs. As a result, the Keepalived pods might not have ran on ingress nodes, which could break the cluster. With this fix, the logic now includes the ingress VIP or VIPs, and the Keepalived pods should always be available. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18771[*OCPBUGS-18771*])

* Previously on Hypershift clusters, pods were not always being scheduled on separate zones. With this update, the `multus-admission-controller` deployment now uses a `PodAntiAffinity` spec for Hypershift to operate in the proper zone. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-15220[*OCPBUGS-15220*])

* Previously, a certificate that existed for 10 minutes was used to implement Multus. With this update, a per node certificate is used for the Multus CNI plugin and the certificate's existence is increased to a 24 hour duration. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-19861[*OCPBUGS-19861*]), (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-19859[*OCPBUGS-19859*])

* Previously, the `spec.desiredState.ovn.bridge-mappings` API configuration deleted all the external IDs in Open vSwitch (OVS) local tables on each Kubernetes node. As a result, the OVN chassis configuration was deleted, breaking the default cluster network. With this fix, you can use the `ovn.bridge-mappings` configuration without affecting the OVS configuration. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18869[*OCPBUGS-18869*])

* Previously, if NMEA sentences were lost on their way to the E810 controller, the T-GM would not be able to synchronize the devices in the network synchronization chain. If these conditions were met, the PTP operator reported an error. With this release, a fix is implemented to report 'FREERUN' in case of a loss of the NMEA string. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-20514[*OCPBUGS-20514*])

* Previously, pods assigned an IP from the pool created by the Whereabouts CNI plugin persisted in the `ContainerCreating` state after a node force reboot. With this release, the Whereabouts CNI plugin issue associated with the IP allocation after a node force reboot is resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18893[*OCPBUGS-18893*])

* Previously, when using the assisted installer, OVN-Kubernetes took a long time to bootstrap. This issue occurred because there were three `ovnkube-control-plane` nodes. The first two started up normally, but the third delayed the installation time. The issue would only resolve after a timeout expiration; afterwards, installation would continue.
+
With this update, the third `ovnkube-control-plane` node has been removed. As a result, the installation time has been reduced. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29480[*OCPBUGS-29480*])

[id="ocp-4-15-node-bug-fixes"]
==== Node

* Due to how the Machine Config Operator (MCO) handles machine configurations for worker pools and custom pools, the MCO might apply an incorrect cgroup version argument for custom pools. As a consequence, nodes in the custom pool might feature an incorrect cgroup kernel argument that causes unpredictable behavior. As a workaround, specify cgroup version kernel arguments for worker and control plane pools only.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-19352[*OCPBUGS-19352*])

* Previously, CRI-O was not configuring the cgroup hierarchy correctly to account for the unique way that `crun` creates cgroups. As a consequence, disabling the CPU quota with a PerformanceProfile did not work. With this fix, using a PerformanceProfile to disable CPU quota works as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-20492[*OCPBUGS-20492*])

* Previously, because of a default setting (`container_use_dri_devices, true`), containers were unable to use dri devices. With this fix, containers can use dri devices as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-24042[*OCPBUGS-24042*])

* Previously, the kubelet was running with the `unconfined_service_t` SELinux type. As a consequence, all our plugins failed to deploy due to an Selinux denial. With this fix, the kubelet now runs with the `kubelet_exec_t` SELinux type. As a result, plugins deploy as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-20022[*OCPBUGS-20022*])

* Previously, the `CRI-O` would automatically remove container images on an upgrade. This caused issues in pre-pulling images. With this release, when {product-title} performs a minor upgrade, the container images will not be automatically removed and instead are subject to kubelet's image garbage collection, which will trigger based on disk usage. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-25228[*OCPBUGS-25228*])

* Previously, when adding RHCOS machines to an existing cluster using ansible playbooks, machines were installed with openvswitch version 2.7. With this update, RHCOS machines added to existing clusters using ansible playbooks are installed with openvswitch version 3.1. This openvswitch version increases network performance.

[id="ocp-4-15-node-tuning-operator-bug-fixes"]
==== Node Tuning Operator (NTO)

* Previously, the Tuned profile reports `Degraded` condition after applying a PerformanceProfile. The generated Tuned profile was trying to set a `sysctl` value for the default Receive Packet Steering (RPS) mask when it already configured the same value using an `/etc/sysctl.d` file. Tuned warns about that and the Node Tuning Operator (NTO) treats that as a degradation with the following message `The TuneD daemon issued one or more error message(s) when applying the profile profile. TuneD stderr: net.core.rps_default_mask`. With this update, the duplication was solved by not setting the default RPS mask using Tuned. The `sysctl.d` file was left in place as it applies early during boot. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-25092[*OCPBUGS-25092*])

* Previously, the Node Tuning Operator (NTO) did not set the `UserAgent` and used a default one. With this update, the NTO sets the `UserAgent` appropriately, which makes debugging the cluster easier. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-19785[*OCPBUGS-19785*])

* Previously, when the Node Tuning Operator (NTO) pod restarted while there were a large number of CSVs in the cluster, the NTO pod would fail and entered into `CrashBackLoop` state. With this update, pagination has been added to the list CSVs requests and this avoids the `api-server` timeout issue that resulted in the `CrashBackLoop` state.

[id="ocp-4-15-openshift-cli-bug-fixes"]
==== OpenShift CLI (oc)

* Previously, to filter operator packages by channel, for example, `mirror.operators.catalog.packages.channels`, you had to specify the default channel for the package, even if you did not intend to use the packages from that channel. Based on this information, the resulting catalog is considered invalid if the `imageSetConfig` does not contain the default channel for the package.
+
This update introduces the `defaultChannel` field in the `mirror.operators.catalog.packages` section. You can now select a default channel. This action enables `oc-mirror` to build a new catalog that defines the selected channel in the `defaultChannel` field as the default for the package. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-385[*OCPBUGS-385*])

* Previously, using `eus-` channels for mirroring in `oc-mirror` resulted in failure. This was due to the restriction of `eus-` channels to mirror only even-numbered releases. With this update, `oc-mirror` can now effectively use `eus-` channels for mirroring releases.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-26065[*OCPBUGS-26065*])

* Previously, while using `oc-mirror` for mirroring local OCI operator catalogs from a hidden folder resulted in the following error:
`error: ".hidden_folder/data/publish/latest/catalog-oci/manifest-list/kubebuilder/kube-rbac-proxy@sha256:<SHASUM>" is not a valid image reference: invalid reference format`.
With this update, the image references are adjusted in the local OCI catalog to prevent any errors during mirroring.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-25077[*OCPBUGS-25077*])

* Previously, the {product-title} CLI (`oc`) version was not printed when running the `must-gather` tool. With this release, the `oc` version is now listed in the summary section when running `must-gather`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-24199[*OCPBUGS-24199*])

* Previously, if you ran a command in `oc debug`. such as `oc debug node/worker -- sleep 5; exit 1`, without attaching to the terminal, a `0` exit code was always returned regardless of the command's exit code. With this release, the exit code is now properly returned from the command. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-20342[*OCPBUGS-20342*])

* Previously, when mirroring, `HTTP401` errors were observed due to expired authentication tokens. These errors occurred during the catalog introspection phase or the image mirroring phase. This issue has been fixed for catalog introspection. Additionally, fixing the Network Time Protocol (NTP) resolves the problem seen during the mirroring phase. For more information, see the article on "Access to the requested resource" error when mirroring images.

[id="ocp-4-15-olm-bug-fixes"]
==== Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

* After you install an Operator, if the catalog becomes unavailable, the subscription for the Operator is updated with a `ResolutionFailed` status condition. Before this update, when the catalog became available again, the `ResolutionFailed` status was not cleared. With this update, this status is now cleared from the subscription after the catalog becomes available, as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29116[*OCPBUGS-29116*])

* With this update, OLM performs a best-effort verification that existing custom resources (CRs) are not invalidated when you install an updated custom resource definition (CRD). (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18948[*OCPBUGS-18948*])

* Before this update, the install plan for an Operator displayed duplicate values in the `clusterSeviceVersionNames` field. This update removes the duplicate values. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-17408[*OCPBUGS-17408*])

* Before this update, if you created an Operator group with same name as a previously existing cluster role, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) overwrote the cluster role. With this fix, OLM generates a unique cluster role name for every Operator group by using the following syntax:
+
.Naming syntax
+
[source,text]
----
olm.og.<operator_group_name>.<admin_edit_or_view>-<hash_value>
----
+
For more information, see xref:../operators/understanding/olm/olm-understanding-operatorgroups.adoc#olm-operatorgroups-rbac_olm-understanding-operatorgroups[Operator groups]. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-14698[*OCPBUGS-14698*])

* Previously, if an Operator installation or upgrade took longer than 10 minutes, the operation could fail with the following error:
+
[source,text]
----
Bundle unpacking failed. Reason: DeadlineExceeded, Message: Job was active longer than specified deadline
----
+
This issue occurred because Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) had a bundle unpacking job that was configured with a timeout of 600 seconds. Bundle unpacking jobs could fail because of network or configuration issues in the cluster that might be transient or resolved with user intervention. With this bug fix, OLM automates the re-creation of failed unpack jobs indefinitely by default.
+
This update adds the optional `operatorframework.io/bundle-unpack-min-retry-interval` annotation for Operator groups. This annotation sets a minimum interval to wait before attempting to re-create the failed job. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-6771[*OCPBUGS-6771*])

* In Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), the Catalog Operator was logging many errors regarding missing `OperatorGroup` objects in namespaces that had no Operators installed. With this fix, if a namespace has no `Subscription` objects in it, OLM no longer checks if an `OperatorGroup` object is present in the namespace. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-25330[*OCPBUGS-25330*])

* With the security context constraint (SCC) API, users are able to configure security contexts for scheduling workloads on their cluster. Because parts of core {product-title} components run as pods that are scheduled on control plane nodes, it is possible to create a SCC that prevents those core components from being properly scheduled in `openshift-*` namespaces.
+
This bug fix reduces the role-based access control (RBAC) scope for the `openshift-operator-lifecycle-manager` service account used to run the `package-server-manager` core component. With this update, it is now significantly less likely that an SCC can be applied to the cluster that causes unexpected scheduling issues with the `package-server-manager` component.
+
[WARNING]
====
The SCC API can globally affect scheduling on an {product-title} cluster. When applying such constraints to workloads on the cluster, carefully read the xref:../authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.adoc#managing-pod-security-policies[SCC documentation].

==== Scalability and performance

* Previously, a race condition between `udev` events and the creation queues associated with physical devices led to some of the queues being configured with the wrong Receive Packet Steering (RPS) mask when they should be reset to zero. This resulted in the RPS mask being configured on the queues of the physical devices, meaning they were using RPS instead of Receive Side Scaling (RSS), which could impact the performance. With this fix, the event was changed to be triggered per queue creation instead of at device creation. This guarantees that no queue will be missing. The queues of all physical devices are now set up with the correct RPS mask which is empty. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18662[*OCPBUGS-18662*])

* Previously, due to differences in setting up a container’s `cgroup` hierarchy, containers that use the `crun` OCI runtime along with a `PerformanceProfile` configuration encountered performance degradation. With this release, when handling a `PerformanceProfile` request, CRI-O accounts for the differences in `crun` and correctly configures the CPU quota to ensure performance. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-20492[*OCPBUGS-20492*])

[id="ocp-4-15-storage-bug-fixes"]
==== Storage

* Previously, {lvms} did not support disabling over-provisioning, and the minimum value for the `thinPoolConfig.overprovisionRatio` field in the `LVMCluster` CR was 2. With this release, you can disable over-provisioning by setting the value of the `thinPoolConfig.overprovisionRatio` field to 1. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-24396[*OCPBUGS-24396*])

* Previously, if the `LVMCluster` CR was created with an invalid device path in the `deviceSelector.optionalPaths` field, the `LVMCluster` CR was in `Progressing` state. With this release, if the `deviceSelector.optionalPaths` field contains an invalid device path, {lvms} updates the `LVMCluster` CR state to `Failed`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-23995[*OCPBUGS-23995*])

* Previously, the {lvms} resource pods were preempted while the cluster was congested. With this release, upon updating {product-title}, {lvms} configures the `priorityClassName` parameter to ensure proper scheduling and preemption behavior while the cluster is congested. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-23375[*OCPBUGS-23375*])

* Previously, upon creating the `LVMCluster` CR, {lvms} skipped the counting of volume groups. This resulted in the `LVMCluster` CR moving to `Progressing` state even when the volume groups were valid. With this release, upon creating the `LVMCluster` CR, {lvms} counts all the volume groups, and updates the `LVMCluster` CR state to `Ready` if the volume groups are valid. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-23191[*OCPBUGS-23191*])

* Previously, if the default device class was not present on all selected nodes, {lvms} failed to set up the `LVMCluster` CR. With this release, {lvms} detects all the default device classes even if the default device class is present only on one of the selected nodes. With this update, you can define the default device class only on one of the selected nodes. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-23181[*OCPBUGS-23181*])

* Previously, upon deleting the worker node in the single-node OpenShift (SNO) and worker node topology, the `LVMCluster` CR still included the configuration of the deleted worker node. This resulted in the `LVMCluster` CR remaining in `Progressing` state. With this release, upon deleting the worker node in the SNO and worker node topology, {lvms} deletes the worker node configuration in the `LVMCluster` CR, and updates the `LVMCluster` CR state to `Ready`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-13558[*OCPBUGS-13558*])

* Previously, CPU limits for the AWS EFS CSI driver container could cause performance degradation of volumes managed by the AWS EFS CSI Driver Operator. With this release, the CPU limits from the AWS EFS CSI driver container have been removed to help prevent potential performance degradation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-28645[*OCPBUGS-28645*])

* Previously, if you used the `performancePlus` parameter in the Azure Disk CSI driver and provisioned volumes 512 GiB or smaller, you would receive an error from the driver that you need a disk size of at least 512 GiB. With this release, if you use the `performancePlus` parameter and provision volumes 512 GiB or smaller, the Azure Disk CSI driver automatically resizes volumes to be 513 GiB.

== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.9 and beyond!
* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])

* When installing a cluster on VMware vSphere with static IP addresses (Tech Preview), the installation program can apply an incorrect configuration to the control plane machine sets (CPMS). This can result in control plane machines being recreated without static IP addresses defined. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29236[*OCPBUGS-28236*])

* Specifying a standard Ebdsv5 or Ebsv5 family machine type instance is not supported when installing an Azure cluster. This limitation is the result of the Azure terraform provider not supporting these machine types. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18690[*OCPBUGS-18690*])

* When running a cluster with FIPS enabled, you might receive the following error when running the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) on a {op-system-base} 9 system: `FIPS mode is enabled, but the required OpenSSL backend is unavailable`. As a workaround, use the `oc` binary provided with the {product-title} cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-23386[*OCPBUGS-23386*])

* In {product-version} with IPv6 networking running on {rh-openstack-first} environments, `IngressController` objects configured with the `endpointPublishingStrategy.type=LoadBalancerService` YAML attribute will not function correctly. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2263550[*BZ#2263550*], link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2263552[*BZ#2263552*])

* In {product-version} with IPv6 networking running on {rh-openstack-first} environments, health monitors created with IPv6 `ovn-octavia` load balancers will not function correctly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29603[*OCPBUGS-29603*])

* In {product-version} with IPv6 networking running on {rh-openstack-first} environments, sharing a IPv6 load balancer with multiple services is not allowed because of an issue that mistakenly marks IPv6 load balancer as internal to the cluster.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29605[*OCPBUGS-29605*])

* When installing an {product-title} cluster with static IP addressing and Tang encryption, nodes start without network settings. This condition prevents nodes from accessing the Tang server, causing installation to fail. To address this condition, you must set the network settings for each node as `ip` installer arguments.
+
. For installer-provisioned infrastructure, before installation provide the network settings as `ip` installer arguments for each node by executing the following steps.

.. Create the manifests.

.. For each node, modify the `BareMetalHost` custom resource with annotations to include the network settings. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd ~/clusterconfigs/openshift
$ vim openshift-worker-0.yaml
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metal3.io/v1alpha1
kind: BareMetalHost
metadata:
  annotations:
    bmac.agent-install.openshift.io/installer-args: '["--append-karg", "ip=<static_ip>::<gateway>:<netmask>:<hostname_1>:<interface>:none", "--save-partindex", "1", "-n"]' <1> <2> <3> <4> <5>
    inspect.metal3.io: disabled
    bmac.agent-install.openshift.io/hostname: <fqdn> <6>
    bmac.agent-install.openshift.io/role: <role> <7>

  generation: 1
  name: openshift-worker-0
  namespace: mynamespace
spec:
  automatedCleaningMode: disabled
  bmc:
    address: idrac-virtualmedia://<bmc_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1 <8>
    credentialsName: bmc-secret-openshift-worker-0
    disableCertificateVerification: true
  bootMACAddress: 94:6D:AE:AB:EE:E8
  bootMode: "UEFI"
  rootDeviceHints:
    deviceName: /dev/sda
----
For the `ip` settings, replace:
<1> `<static_ip>` with the static IP address for the node, for example, `192.168.1.100`
<2> `<gateway>` with the IP address of your network's gateway, for example, `192.168.1.1`
<3> `<netmask>` with the network mask, for example, `255.255.255.0`
<4> `<hostname_1>` with the node's hostname, for example, `node1.example.com`
<5> `<interface>` with the name of the network interface, for example, `eth0`
<6> `<fqdn>` with the fully qualified domain name of the node
<7> `<role>` with `worker` or `master` to reflect the node's role
<8> `<bmc_ip>` with the BMC IP address and the protocol and path of the BMC, as needed.

.. Save the file to the `clusterconfigs/openshift` directory.

.. Create the cluster.

. When installing with the {ai-full}, before installation modify each node's installer arguments using the API to append the network settings as `ip` installer arguments. For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ curl https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/infra-envs/${infra_env_id}/hosts/${host_id}/installer-args \
-X PATCH \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '
    {
      "args": [
        "--append-karg",
        "ip=<static_ip>::<gateway>:<netmask>:<hostname_1>:<interface>:none", <1> <2> <3> <4> <5>
        "--save-partindex",
        "1",
        "-n"
      ]
    }
  ' | jq
----
For the previous network settings, replace:
<1> `<static_ip>` with the static IP address for the node, for example, `192.168.1.100`
<2> `<gateway>` with the IP address of your network's gateway, for example, `192.168.1.1`
<3> `<netmask>` with the network mask, for example, `255.255.255.0`
<4> `<hostname_1>` with the node's hostname, for example, `node1.example.com`
<5> `<interface>` with the name of the network interface, for example, `eth0`.

Contact Red Hat Support for additional details and assistance.

(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-23119[*OCPBUGS-23119*])

* In {product-title} {product-version}, all nodes use Linux control group version 2 (cgroup v2) for internal resource management in alignment with the default {op-system-base} 9 configuration. However, if you apply a performance profile in your cluster, the low-latency tuning features associated with the performance profile do not support cgroup v2.
+
As a result, if you apply a performance profile, all nodes in the cluster reboot to switch back to the cgroup v1 configuration. This reboot includes control plane nodes and worker nodes that were not targeted by the performance profile.
+
To revert all nodes in the cluster to the cgroups v2 configuration, you must edit the `Node` resource. For more information, see xref:../nodes/clusters/nodes-cluster-cgroups-2.adoc#nodes-clusters-cgroups-2_nodes-cluster-cgroups-2[Configuring Linux cgroup v2]. You cannot revert the cluster to the cgroups v2 configuration by removing the last performance profile. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-16976[*OCPBUGS-16976*])

* Currently, an error might occur when deleting a pod that uses an SR-IOV network device. This error is caused by a change in {op-system-base} 9 where the previous name of a network interface is added to its alternative names list when it is renamed. As a consequence, when a pod attached to an SR-IOV virtual function (VF) is deleted, the VF returns to the pool with a new unexpected name, such as `dev69`, instead of its original name, such as `ensf0v2`. Although this error is not severe, the Multus and SR-IOV logs might show the error while the system recovers on its own. Deleting the pod might take a few seconds longer due to this error. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-11281[*OCPBUGS-11281*], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18822[*OCPBUGS-18822*], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-5988[*RHEL-5988*])
* When you run Cloud-native Network Functions (CNF) latency tests on an {product-title} cluster, the `oslat` test can sometimes return results greater than 20 microseconds. This results in an `oslat` test failure.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-9279[*RHEL-9279*])

* When you use `preempt-rt` patches with the real time kernel and you update the SMP affinity of a network interrupt, the corresponding Interrupt Request (IRQ) thread does not immediately receive the update.
Instead, the update takes effect when the next interrupt is received, and the thread is subsequently migrated to the correct core.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-9148[*RHEL-9148*])

* The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) module in an Intel Westport Channel e810 NIC that is configured as a grandmaster clock (T-GM) can report the GPS `FIX` state and the GNSS offset between the GNSS module and the GNSS constellation satellites.
+
The current T-GM implementation does not use the `ubxtool` CLI to probe the `ublox` module for reading the GNSS offset and GPS `FIX` values.
Instead, it uses the `gpsd` service to read the GPS `FIX` information.
This is because the current implementation of the `ubxtool` CLI takes 2 seconds to receive a response, and with every call, it increases CPU usage threefold.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-17422[*OCPBUGS-17422*])

* The current grandmaster clock (T-GM) implementation has a single NMEA sentence generator sourced from the GNSS without a backup NMEA sentence generator.
If NMEA sentences are lost on their way to the e810 NIC, the T-GM cannot synchronize the devices in the network synchronization chain and the PTP Operator reports an error.
A proposed fix is to report a `FREERUN` event when the NMEA string is lost.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-19838[*OCPBUGS-19838*])

* Currently, the *YAML* tab of some pages in the web console stops unexpectedly on some browsers when the multicluster engine for Kubernetes operator (MCE) is installed. The following message is displayed: "Oh no! Something went wrong." (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29812[*OCPBUGS-29812*])

* If you have IPsec enabled on the cluster and IPsec encryption is configured between the cluster and an external node, stopping the IPsec connection on the external node causes a loss of connectivity to the external node. This connectivity loss occurs because on the {product-title} side of the connection, the IPsec tunnel shutdown is not recognized. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-24802[*RHEL-24802*])

* If you have IPsec enabled on the cluster, and your cluster is a hosted control planes for {product-title} cluster, the MTU adjustment to account for the IPsec tunnel for pod-to-pod traffic does not happen automatically. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-28757[*OCPBUGS-28757*])

* If you have IPsec enabled on the cluster, you cannot modify existing IPsec tunnels to external hosts that you have created. Modifying an existing NMState Operator `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` object to adjust an existing IPsec configuration to encrypt traffic to external hosts is not recognized by {product-title}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-22720[*RHEL-22720*])

* If you have IPsec enabled on the cluster, on the node hosting the north-south IPsec connection, restarting the `ipsec.service` systemd unit or restarting the `ovn-ipsec-host` pod causes a loss of the IPsec connection. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-26878[*RHEL-26878*])

* Currently, there is a known issue with the mirroring of operator catalogs. The `oc-mirror` rebuilds the catalogs and regenerates their internal cache according to the `imagesetconfig` catalog filtering specifications. This operation requires the use of the `opm` binary contained in the catalogs. In OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, the operator catalogs contain the `opm` RHEL 9 binary, which causes the mirroring process to fail on RHEL 8 systems. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31536[*OCPBUGS-31536*])

* Currently, defining a `sysctl` value for a setting with a slash in its name, such as for bond devices, in the `profile` field of a Tuned resource might not work. Values with a slash in the `sysctl` option name are not mapped correctly to the `/proc` filesystem. As a workaround, create a `MachineConfig` resource that places a configuration file with the required values in the `/etc/sysctl.d` node directory. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-3707[*RHEL-3707*])

* Due to an issue with Kubernetes, the CPU Manager is unable to return CPU resources from the last pod admitted to a node to the pool of available CPU resources. These resources are allocatable if a subsequent pod is admitted to the node. However, this in turn becomes the last pod, and again, the CPU manager cannot return this pod's resources to the available pool.
+
This issue affects CPU load balancing features because these features depend on the CPU Manager releasing CPUs to the available pool. Consequently, non-guaranteed pods might run with a reduced number of CPUs. As a workaround, schedule a pod with a `best-effort` CPU Manager policy on the affected node. This pod will be the last admitted pod and this ensures the resources will be correctly released to the available pool.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-17792[*OCPBUGS-17792*])

* When a node reboot occurs all pods are restarted in a random order. In this scenario it is possible that `tuned` pod started after the workload pods. This means the workload pods start with partial tuning, which can affect performance or even cause the workload to fail. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-26400[*OCPBUGS-26400*])

* The installation of {product-title} might fail when a performance profile is present in the extra manifests folder and targets the primary or worker pools. This is caused by the internal install ordering that processes the performance profile before the default primary and worker `MachineConfigPools` are created. It is possible to workaround this issue by including a copy of the stock primary or worker `MachineConfigPools` in the extra manifests folder. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-27948[*OCPBUGS-27948*]) (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18640[*OCPBUGS-18640*])

* In hosted control planes for {product-title}, the HyperShift Operator extracts the release metadata only once during Operator initialization. When you make changes in the management cluster or create a hosted cluster, the HyperShift Operator does not refresh the release metadata. As a workaround, restart the HyperShift Operator by deleting its pod deployment. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29110[*OCPBUGS-29110*])

* In hosted control planes for {product-title}, when you create the custom resource definition (CRD) for `ImageDigestMirrorSet` and `ImageContentSourcePolicy` objects at the same time in a disconnected environment, the HyperShift Operator creates the object only for the `ImageDigestMirrorSet` CRD, ignoring the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` CRD. As a workaround, copy the `ImageContentSourcePolicies` object configuration in the `ImageDigestMirrorSet` CRD. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29466[*OCPBUGS-29466*])

* In hosted control planes for {product-title}, when creating a hosted cluster in a disconnected environment, if you do not set the `hypershift.openshift.io/control-plane-operator-image` annotation explicitly in the `HostedCluster` resource, the hosted cluster deployment fails with an error.

==== Bug fixes

* Previously, in HAProxy 2.6 deployments on {product-title}, shutting down HAproxy could result in a race condition. The main thread `(tid=0)` would wait for other threads to complete, but some threads would enter an infinite loop, consuming 100% CPU. With this release, the variable controlling the loop's termination is now properly reset, preventing non-main threads from looping indefinitely. This ensures that the thread's poll loop can terminate correctly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33883[*OCPBUGS-33883*])

* Previously, the console Operator health check controller had a missing return statement, which caused the Operator to crash unexpectedly in some cases. With this release, the issue has been fixed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33720[*OCPBUGS-33720*])

* Previously, the `wait-for-ceo` command used during the bootstrapping process to verify etcd rollout did not report errors for some failure modes. With this release, those error messages are visible on the `bootkube` script if the `wait-for-ceo` command exits in an error case.

==== Bug fixes

* Previously, certain situations caused transfer of an Egress IP address from one node to a different node to fail, and this failure impacted the OVN-Kubernetes network. The network failed to send gratuitous Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) requests to peers to inform them of the new node's medium access control (MAC) address. As a result, peers would temporarily send reply traffic to an old node and this traffic led to failover issues. With this release, the OVN-Kubernetes network correctly sends a gratuitous ARP to peers to inform them of the new Egress IP node MAC address, so that each peer can send reply traffic to the new node without causing failover time issues. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33960[*OCPBUGS-33960*])

* Previously, when mirroring Operator catalogs, the `oc-mirror` CLI plugin rebuilt the catalogs and regenerated the catalog's internal cache according to the `imagesetconfig` catalog filtering specifications. This operation required the use of the `opm` binary found within the catalogs. In {product-title} 4.15, Operator catalogs include the `opm` {op-system-base-full} 9 binary, and this caused the mirroring process to fail when running on {op-system-base} 8 systems. With this release, `oc-mirror` no longer builds catalogs by default. Instead, catalogs are mirrored directly to their destination registries. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33575[*OCPBUGS-33575*])

* Previously, the image registry did not support Amazon Web Services (AWS) region `ca-west-1`. With this release, the image registry can now be deployed in this region. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33672[*OCPBUGS-33672*])

* Previously, service accounts (SAs) could not be used as OAuth2 clients because there were no tokens associated with the SAs. With this release, the OAuth registry client has been modified to anticipate this case and the issue has been resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33210[*OCPBUGS-33210*])

* Previously, the proxy information set in the `install-config.yaml` file was not applied to the bootstrap process. With this release, the proxy information is applied to the bootstrap Ignition data which is applied to the bootstrap machine and the issue has been resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33205[*OCPBUGS-33205*])

* Previously, the information from the `imageRegistryOverrides` setting was only extracted once on the HyperShift Operator initialization and did not refresh. With this release, the Hypershift Operator retrieves the new `ImageContentSourcePolicy` files from the management cluster and adds them to the Hypershift Operator and Control Plane Operator in every reconciliation loop. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33117[*OCPBUGS-33117*])

* Previously, the Hypershift Operator was not using the `RegistryOverrides` mechanism to inspect the image from the internal registry. With this release, the metadata inspector works as expected during the Hypershift Operator reconciliation, and the `OverrideImages` are properly populated. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32220[*OCPBUGS-32220*])

* Previously, attempting to update the {vmw-first} connection configuration for {product-title} failed if the configuration included `””` characters. With this release, the characters are stored correctly and the issue has been resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31863[*OCPBUGS-31863*])

==== Bug fixes

* Previously, if traffic was forwarded to terminating endpoints that were not functioning, communications problems occured unless the readiness probes on these endpoints were configured to quickly flag the endpoints as not serving. This occurred because the the endpoint selection for services partially implemented KEP-1669 `ProxyTerminatingEndpoints` traffic to services inside the {product-title} cluster. As a result, this traffic was forwarded to all endpoints that were either ready, such as `ready=true`, `serving=true`, `terminating=false`,  or terminating and serving, such as `ready=false`, `serving=true`, `terminating=true`. This caused communication issues when traffic was forwarded to terminating endpoints and the readiness probes on these endpoints were not configured to quickly flag the endpoints as not serving, `serving=false`, when they were no longer functional. With this release, the endpoints selection logic now fully implements KEP-1669 `ProxyTerminatingEndpoints` for any given service so that all ready endpoints are selected. If no ready endpoints are found, functional terminating and serving endpoints are used.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-27852[*OCPBUGS-27852*])

* Previously, if you configured an {product-title} cluster with a high number of internal services or user-managed load balancer IP addresses, you experienced a delayed startup time for the OVN-Kubernetes service. This delay occurred when the OVN-Kubernetes service attempted to install `iptables` rules on a node. With this release, the OVN-Kubernetes service can process a large number of services in a few seconds. Additionally, you can access a new log to view the status of installing `iptables` rules on a node. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32426[*OCPBUGS-32426*])

* Previously, some container processes created by using the `exec` command persisted even when CRI-O stopped the container. Consequently, lingering processes led to tracking issues, causing process leaks and defunct statuses. With this release, CRI-O tracks the `exec` calls processed for a container and ensures that the processes created as part of the `exec` calls are terminated when the container is stopped. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32481[*OCPBUGS-32481*])

* Previously, the *Topology* view in the {product-title} web console did not show the visual connector between a virtual machine (VM) node and other non-VM components. With this release, the visual connector shows interaction activity of a component. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32505[*OCPBUGS-32505*])

* Previously, a logo in the masthead element of the {product-title} web console could grow beyond 60 pixels in height. This caused the masthead to increase in height. With this release, the masthead logo is constrained to a `max-height` of 60 pixels. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33548[*OCPBUGS-33548*])

* Previously, if you need the *Form* view in the {product-title} web console to remove an alternate service from a `Route` resource, the alternate service remained in the cluster. With this release, if you delete an alternate service in this way, the alternate service is fully removed from the cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33058[*OCPBUGS-33058*])

* Previously, {product-title} cluster connections to the {azure-first} API were delayed because of an issue with the API's codebase. With this release, a timeout schedule is set for any calls to the {azure-short} API, so that an API call that hangs for a period of time is terminated. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33127[*OCPBUGS-33127*])

* Previously, a kernel regression that was introduced in {product-title} 4.15.0 caused kernel issues, such as nodes crashing and rebooting, in nodes that mounted to CephFS storage. In this release, the regression issue is fixed so that the kernel regression issue no longer occurs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33250[*OCPBUGS-33250*])

* Previously, the {vmw-first} Problem Detector Operator did not have HTTP and HTTPS proxies configured for it. This resulted in invalid cluster configuration error messages because connection issues between the Operator and the {vmw-full} vCenter server. With this release, the {vmw-short} Problem Detector Operator uses the same HTTP and HTTPS proxies as other {product-title} cluster Operators so that the {vmw-short} Problem Detector Operator can connect to the {vmw-full} vCenter. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33466[*OCPBUGS-33466*])

* Previously, Alertmanager would send notification emails that contained a backlink to the Thanos Querier web interface. This web interface is an unreachable web service. With this release, monitoring alert notification emails contain a backlink to the {product-title} web console's **Alerts* page. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33512[*OCPBUGS-33512*])

==== Bug fixes

* Previously, the name of the Security Context Constraint (SCC) was incorrect so there was no functioning built-in cluster role. With this release, the name was changed to `hostmount-anyuid` and the SCC now has a functioning built-in cluster role. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33277[*OCPBUGS-33277*])

* Previously, the Ironic Python Agent (IPA) failed when trying to wipe disks because it expected the wrong byte sector size, which caused the node provisioning to fail. With this release, the IPA checks the disk sector size and node provisioning succeeds. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33133[*OCPBUGS-33133*])

* Previously, Static Persistent Volumes in Azure File on Workload Identity clusters could not be configured due to a bug in the driver causing volume mounts to fail. With this release, the driver has now been fixed, and Static Persistent Volumes mount correctly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33038[*OCPBUGS-33038*])

* Previously, during {product-title} updates in performance-tuned clusters, resuming a `MachineConfigPool` resource resulted in additional restarts for nodes in the pool. This was due to the performance profile controller reconciling against outdated machine configurations while the pool was paused. With this update, the controller reconciles against the latest planned machine configurations before the pool resumes, preventing additional node reboots. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32978[*OCPBUGS-32978*])

* Previously, the load balancing algorithm did not differentiate between active and inactive services when determining weights, and it employed the `random` algorithm excessively in environments with many inactive services or environments routing backends with weight 0. This led to increased memory usage and a higher risk of excessive memory consumption. With this release, changes are made to optimize traffic direction towards active services only and prevent unnecessary use of the `random` algorithm with higher weights, reducing the potential for excessive memory consumption. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32977[*OCPBUGS-32977*])

* Previously, If a user created a `ContainerRuntimeConfig` resource as an extra manifest for a single-node {product-title} cluster (SNO) installation, the boostrap process failed with the error: `more than one ContainerRuntimeConfig found that matches MCP labels`. With this release, the incorrect processing of `ContainerRuntimeConfig` resources is fixed, which resolves the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-30152[*OCPBUGS-30152*])

* Previously, the Helm Plugin index view did not display the same number of charts as the Helm CLI if the chart names varied. With this release, the Helm catalog now looks for `charts.openshift.io/name` and `charts.openshift.io/provider` so that all versions are grouped together in a single catalog title. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32716[*OCPBUGS-32716*])

* Previously, the description of the hosted control plane CLI flag `api-server-address` was unclear. With this release, the description has been updated for clarity and completeness. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-25858[*OCPBUGS-25858*])

[id="ocp-4-15-12-apiversion-upgrade-v1beta1"]
===== API version for the ClusterTriggerBinding, TriggerTemplate, and EventListener CRDs upgraded from v1alpha1 to v1beta1

* Previously, the API version for the `ClusterTriggerBinding`, `TriggerTemplate`, and `EventListener` CRDs was `v1alpha1`. With this release, the API version is upgraded to `v1beta1` so that the pipelines plugin supports the latest Pipeline Trigger API version for the `ClusterTriggerBinding`, `TriggerTemplate`, and `EventListener` CRDs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31445[*OCPBUGS-31445*])

[id="ocp-4-15-12-pipeline-list-page-improvement"]
===== PipelineRun list view performance improvement

* Previously, in the `PipelineRun` list page, all of the `TaskRun` objects were fetched and separated based on their `PipelineRun` name. With this release, `TaskRun` objects are only fetched for failed and cancelled `PipelineRun` objects, and a caching mechanism is added to fetch the `PipelineRun` and `TaskRun` objects that are associated with the failed and cancelled `PipelineRun` objects. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31799[*OCPBUGS-31799*])

[id="ocp-4-15-12-installer-handling-new-character"]
===== Installer handles the escaping of the % character

* Previously, if a cluster was installed using a proxy, and the proxy information contained escaped characters in the format `%XX`, the installation failed. With this release, the installer now handles the escaping of the `%` character. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32259[*OCPBUGS-32259*])

[id="ocp-4-15-12-cfe-evaluation-status"]
===== Cluster Fleet Evaluation status information added to the Machine Config Operator

* Previously, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) did not include the Cluster Fleet Evaluation (CFE) status. With this release, the CFE status information is added to the MCO and available to customers. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32922[*OCPBUGS-32922*])

[id="ocp-4-15-12-operatorhub-filter-rename-FIPS"]
===== OperatorHub filter renamed from FIPS Mode to Designed for FIPS

* Previously, OperatorHub included a filter named *FIPS Mode*. With this release, that filter is named *Designed for FIPS*. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32933[*OCPBUGS-32933*])

[id="ocp-4-15-12-bug-fixes"]
==== Bug fixes

* Previously, containers had an incorrect view of the pids limit in their `cgroup` hierarchy and reported as a random number instead of `max`. The containers do not have max PIDs and are limited by the pod PID limit, which is set outside of the container's `cgroup` hierarchy and not visible from within the container. With this release, the issue has been resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-28926[*OCPBUGS-28926*])

* Previously, for {product-title} deployments on {rh-openstack-first}, the `MachineSet` object did not correctly apply the value for the `Port Security` parameter. With this release, the `MachineSet` object applies the `port_security_enabled` flag as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-30857[*OCPBUGS-30857*])

* Previously, the installation program erroneously attempted to verify the libvirt network interfaces when an agent-based installation was configured with the `openshift-baremetal-install` binary. With this release, the agent installation method does not require libvirt and this validation is disabled. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-30944[*OCPBUGS-30944*])

* Previously, the `cpuset-configure.sh` script could run before all of the system processes were created. With this release, the script is only triggered to run when CRI-O is initialized and the issue is resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31692[*OCPBUGS-31692*])

* Previously, an incorrect `dnsPolicy` was used for the `konnectivity-agent` daemon set in the data plane. As a result, when CoreDNS was down, `konnectivity-agent` pods on the data plane could not resolve the `proxy-server-address` and could fail the `konnectivity-server` in the control plane. With this release, `konnectivity-agent` uses the host system DNS service to lookup the `proxy-server-address` and no longer depends on CoreDNS. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31826[*OCPBUGS-31826*])

* Previously, if gathering logs from the bootstrap node failed during the `gather bootstrap` execution, the virtual machine (VM) serial console logs were not included in the gather output even if they were collected. With this release, serial logs are always included if they are collected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32264[*OCPBUGS-32264*])

* Previously, port 22 was missing from the compute node's security group in AWS SDK installations, therefore connecting to the compute nodes with SSH failed when users used AWS SDK provisioning. With this release, port 22 is added to the compute node's security group and the issue is resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32383[*OCPBUGS-32383*])

* Previously, the installation program required the `s3:HeadBucket` permission for AWS, even though it does not exist. The correct permission for the `HeadBucket` action is `s3:ListBucket`. With this release, `s3:HeadBucket` is removed from the list of required permissions and only `s3:ListBucket` is required, as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32690[*OCPBUGS-32690*])

* Previously, there was an issue with {product-title} Ansible upgrades because the IPsec configuration was not idempotent. With this release, changes are made to the {product-title} Ansible playbooks, ensuring that all IPsec configurations are idempotent.

==== Enhancements

The following enhancements are included in this z-stream release:

[id="ocp-4-15-11-topology-page-node-limit-increase"]
===== Increased the number of supported nodes on the *Topology* view

* Previously, the {product-title} web console *Topology* view could only display a maximum of 100 nodes. If you attempted to view more than 100 nodes, the web console would output a `Loading is taking longer than expected.` error message. With this release, the `MAX_NODES_LIMIT` parameter for the web console is set to `200`, so that the web console can display a maximum of 200 nodes. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32340[*OCPBUGS-32340*])

[id="ocp-4-15-11-grc-acr-rhel-providers"]
===== Added `gcr` and `acr` {op-system-base} credential providers

* {product-title} {product-version} includes `gcr` and `acr` {op-system-base-full} credential providers so that future upgrades to later versions of {product-title} that require {op-system-base} compute nodes deployed on a cluster do not result in a failed installation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-30970[*OCPBUGS-30970*])

[id="ocp-4-15-11-featuregates-rbac-dns-operator"]
===== Added permission for reading the `featureGates` resource to RBAC rule

* {product-title} {product-version} adds a permission to the role-based access control (RBAC) rule so that the DNS Operator can read the `featureGates` resource. Without this permission, an upgrade operation to a later version of {product-title} could fail. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32093[*OCPBUGS-32093*])

[id="ocp-4-15-11-bug-fixes"]
==== Bug fixes

* The installation of {product-title} failed when a performance profile was located in the extra manifests folder and targeted *master* or *worker* node roles. This was caused by the internal installation that processes the performance profile before the default *master* or *worker* node roles were created. With this release, the internal installation processes the performance profile after the node roles are created so that this issue no longer exists. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-27948[*OCPBUGS-27948*])

* Previously, the image registry did not support {aws-first} region `ca-west-1`. With this release, the image registry can now be deployed in this region. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31641[*OCPBUGS-31641*])

* Previously, a cluster upgraded to {product-title} 4.14 or later experienced router pods unexpectedly closing `keep-alive` connections that caused traffic degradation issues for Apache HTTP clients. This issue was caused by router pods using a version of an HAProxy router that closed idle connections after the HAProxy router was restarted. With this release, the pods use a version of an HAProxy router that includes an `idle-close-on-response` option. The HAProxy router now waits for the last request and response transaction before the idle connection is closed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32435[*OCPBUGS-32435*])

* Previously, a Redfish virtual media Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) integrated Lights Out (iLO) 5 bare-metal machine's compression was forcibly disabled to workaround other unrelated issues in different hardware models. This caused the `FirmwareSchema` resource to be missing from each iLO 5 bare-metal machine. Each machine needs compression to fetch message registries from their Redfish Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) endpoints. With this release, each iLO 5 bare-metal machine that needs the `FirmwareSchema` resource does not have compression forcibly disabled. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31686[*OCPBUGS-31686*])

* Previously, nodes of paused `MachineConfigPools` might have their pause status dropped when performing a cluster update. With this release, nodes of paused `MachineConfigPools` correctly stay paused when performing a cluster update. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31839[*OCPBUGS-31839*])

* Previously, newer versions of Redfish used Manager resources to deprecate the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for the RedFish Virtual Media API. This caused any hardware that used the newer Redfish URI for Virtual Media to not be provisioned. With this release, the Ironic API identifies the correct Redfish URI to deploy for the RedFish Virtual Media API so that hardware relying on either the deprecated or the newer URI could be provisioned.  (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31830[*OCPBUGS-31830*])

* Previously, the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) checked for a non-existent `s3:HeadBucket` permission during the validation checks in mint mode that resulted in a failed cluster installation. With this release, CCO removes the validation check for this non-existing permission so that validation checks pass in mint mode and the cluster installation does not fail. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31924[*OCPBUGS-31924*])

* Previously, a new Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) Operator that upgraded to {product-title} 4.15.3 resulted in failure because important resources were not injected into the upgrade operation. With this release, these resources are now cached so that newer OLM Operator upgrades can succeed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32311[*OCPBUGS-32311*])

* Previously, the Red{nbsp} {product-title} web console did not require the `Creator` field as a mandatory field. API changes specified an empty value for this field, but a user profile could still create silent alerts. With this release, the API marks the `Creator` field as a mandatory field for a user profile that needs to create silent alerts. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32097[*OCPBUGS-32097*])

* Previously, in hosted control planes for {product-title}, when you created the custom resource definition (CRD) for `ImageDigestMirrorSet` and `ImageContentSourcePolicy` objects at the same time in a disconnected environment, the HyperShift Operator created the object only for the `ImageDigestMirrorSet` CRD, ignoring the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` CRD. With this release, the HyperShift Operator can create objects at the same time for the `ImageDigestMirrorSet` and `ImageContentSourcePolicy` CRDs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32164[*OCPBUGS-32164*])

* Previously, IPv6 networking services that operated in {rh-openstack-first} environments could not share an IPv6 load balancer that was configured with multiple services because of an issue that mistakenly marks an IPv6 load balancer as `Internal` to the cluster. With this release, IPv6 load balancers are no longer marked as `Internal` so that an IPv6 load balancer with multiple services can be shared among IPv6 networking services. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32246[*OCPBUGS-32246*])

* Previously, the control plane machine sets (CPMS) did not allow template names for vSphere in a CPMS definition. With this release, a CPMS Operator fix allows template names for vSphere in the CPMS definition so that this issue no longer persists. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32357[*OCPBUGS-32357*])

* Previously, the control plane machine sets (CPMS) Operator was not correctly handling older {product-title} version configurations that had a vSphere definition in the infrastructure custom resource. This would cause cluster upgrade operations to fail and the CPMS Operator to remain in a `crashloopback` state. With this release, the cluster upgrade operations do not fail because of this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32414[*OCPBUGS-32414*])

* Previously, the image registry's Azure path fix job incorrectly required the presence of `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` and `TENANT_CLIENT_ID` parameters to function. This caused a valid configuration to throw an error message. With this release, adds a check to the Identity and Access Management (IAM) service account key to validate if these parameters are needed, so that a cluster upgrade operation no longer fails. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32396[*OCPBUGS-32396*])

* Previously, a build pod that failed because of a memory limitation would have its pod status changed to `Error` instead of `OOMKilled`. This caused these pods to not be reported correctly. The issue would only occur on cgroup v2 nodes. With this release, a pod with a status of `OOMKilled` is correctly detected and reported.

==== Bug fixes

* Previously, clusters created before {product-title} 4.7 will have had signer keys for api-int endpoint updated unexpectedly when users upgraded to {product-title} 4.15 due to the installer deleting the SecretTypeTLS and then recreating the secret with `kubernetes.io/tls` type.  With this release, the issue is resolved by the installer changing the secret type without deleting the secret. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31807[*OCPBUGS-31807*])

* Previously, when users imported image stream tags, `ImageContentSourcePolicy` (ICSP) was not allowed to co-exist with `ImageDigestMirrorSet` (IDMS) and `ImageTagMirrorSet` (ITMS). {product-title} ignored any IDMS/ITMS created by the user and favored ICSP. With this release, they are allowed to co-exist since importing image stream tags will now respect IDMS/ITMS when ICSP is also present. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31469[*OCPBUGS-31469*])

* Previously, Terraform would create the compute server group with the policy set for the control plane. As a consequence, the 'serverGroupPolicy' property of the `install-config.yaml` file was ignored for the compute server group. With this release, the server group policy set in the `install-config.yaml` file for the compute MachinePool is correctly applied at install-time in the Terraform flow.  (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31335[*OCPBUGS-31335*])

* Previously, projects that specified a non-intersecting openshift.io/node-selector project selector with pods `.spec.nodeName` could cause runaway Pod creation in Deployments. With this release, pods with non-intersecting `.spec.nodeName` are not admitted by the API server which resolves the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29922[*OCPBUGS-29922*])

* Previously, a remote attacker with basic login credentials could check the pod manifest to discover a repository pull secret. With this release, the vulnerability has been fixed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-28769[*OCPBUGS-28769*])

===== Number of configured control plane replicas validated

* Previously, the number of control plane replicas could be set to an invalid value, such as 2. With this release, a validation is added to prevent any misconfiguration of the control plane replicas at the ISO generation time. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-30822[*OCPBUGS-30822*])

With this release, OVS-configurations are no longer run before kdump. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-30884[*OCPBUGS-30884*])

* Previously, the `coreos-installer` CLI tool did not correctly modify, reset, or show the kernel arguments for an ISO generated by the `openshift-install agent create image` command. With this release, the `coreos-installer iso kargs modify <iso>`, `coreos-installer iso kargs reset <iso>`, and `coreos-installer iso kargs show <iso>` commands all work as expected.

* Providing a performance profile as an extra manifest at Day 0 did not work in {product-title} 4.15.0, but it is now possible in 4.15.2 with the following limitation:
+
The installation of {product-title} might fail when a performance profile is present in the extra manifests folder and targets the primary or worker pools. This is caused by the internal installation ordering that processes the performance profile before the default primary and worker `MachineConfigPools` are created. It is possible to workaround this issue by including a copy of the stock primary or worker `MachineConfigPools` in the extra manifests folder. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-27948[*OCPBUGS-27948*], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29752[*OCPBUGS-29752*])

[id="ocp-4-15-2-bug-fixes"]
==== Bug fixes

* Previously, when updating to {product-title} 4.15, `CatalogSource` objects never refreshed, which caused the optional Operator catalogs to fail to update. With this release, the image pull policy is changed to `Always`, which enables the optional Operator catalogs to update correctly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-30193[*OCPBUGS-30193*])

* Previously, the `nodeStatusReportFrequency` setting was linked to the `nodeStatusUpdateFrequency` setting. With this release, the `nodeStatusReportFrequency` setting is set to 5 minutes. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29797[*OCPBUGS-29797*])

* Previously, under certain conditions, the installer would fail with the error message `unexpected end of JSON input`. With this release, the error message is clarified and suggests users set the `serviceAccount` field in the `install-config.yaml` file to fix the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29495[*OCPBUGS-29495*])
