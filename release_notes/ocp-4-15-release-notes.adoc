== About this release

// TODO: Update with the relevant information closer to release.
{product-title} (link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:XXXX[RHSA-2024:XXXX]) is now available. This release uses link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.27.md[Kubernetes 1.27] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at https://console.redhat.com/openshift. With the {cluster-manager-first} application for {product-title}, you can deploy {product-title} clusters to either on-premises or cloud environments.

// Double check OP system versions
{product-title} {product-version} is supported on {op-system-base-full} 8.6, 8.7, and 8.8 as well as on {op-system-first} 4.13.

You must use {op-system} machines for the control plane, and you can use either {op-system} or {op-system-base} for compute machines.
//Removed the note per https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GRPA-3517

//TODO: Add this for 4.14
Starting with {product-title} 4.12, an additional six months is added to the Extended Update Support (EUS) phase on even numbered releases from 18 months to two years. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

Starting with {product-title} {product-version}, Extended Update Support (EUS) is extended to 64-bit ARM, {ibm-power-name} (ppc64le), and {ibm-z-name} (s390x) platforms. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift-eus[OpenShift EUS Overview].

//TODO: Add the line below for EUS releases.
{product-title} {product-version} is an Extended Update Support (EUS) release. More information on Red Hat OpenShift EUS is available in link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#ocp4_phases[OpenShift Life Cycle] and link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift-eus[OpenShift EUS Overview].

//TODO: The line below should be used when it is next appropriate. Revisit in August 2023 time frame.
Maintenance support ends for version 4.12 on 25 January 2025 and goes to extended life phase. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

Commencing with the {product-version} release, Red Hat is simplifying the administration and management of Red Hat shipped cluster Operators with the introduction of three new life cycle classifications; Platform Aligned, Platform Agnostic, and Rolling Stream. These life cycle classifications provide additional ease and transparency for cluster administrators to understand the life cycle policies of each Operator and form cluster maintenance and upgrade plans with predictable support boundaries. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/j/includes/session/scribe/?redirectTo=https%3A%2F%2Faccess.redhat.com%2Fsupport%2Fpolicy%2Fupdates%2Fopenshift_operators[OpenShift Operator Life Cycles].

// Added in 4.14. Language came directly from Kirsten Newcomer.
{product-title} is designed for FIPS. When running {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures.

For more information about the NIST validation program, see link:https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules[Cryptographic Module Validation Program]. For the latest NIST status for the individual versions of {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted for validation, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2918071#fips-140-2-and-fips-140-3-2[Compliance Activities and Government Standards].

The scope of support for layered and dependent components of {product-title} changes independently of the {product-title} version. To determine the current support status and compatibility for an add-on, refer to its release notes. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

== Integrate CAPO into the cluster CAPI Operator (Tech Preview)

The Cluster API Provider for OpenStack (CAPO) is now deployed by default when the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature flag is enabled. The lifecycle of this component is managed by the Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface (CAPI) Operator. When the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature flag is enabled, an OpenStack cluster and additional {product-title} cluster are automatically created for the current {product-title} cluster. It is now possible to configure the CAPI machine and OpenStack machine resources in a similar fashion to how the Mail Application Programming Interface (MAPI) resources are configured. It is important to note that these resources are equivalent but not identical.

=== Cluster metrics ports secured

With this release, the ports that serve metrics for the Cluster Machine Approver Operator and Cluster Cloud Controller Manager Operator use the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol for additional security. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPCLOUD-2272[*OCPCLOUD-2272*], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPCLOUD-2271[*OCPCLOUD-2271*])

[id="ocp-4-15-cluster-cloud-controller-manager-operator"]
=== Cloud controller manager for Google Cloud Platform

The Kubernetes community plans to deprecate the use of the Kubernetes controller manager to interact with underlying cloud platforms in favor of using cloud controller managers. As a result, there is no plan to add Kubernetes controller manager support for any new cloud platforms.

This release introduces the General Availability of using a cloud controller manager for Google Cloud Platform.

To learn more about the cloud controller manager, see the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller/[Kubernetes Cloud Controller Manager documentation].

To manage the cloud controller manager and cloud node manager deployments and lifecycles, use the Cluster Cloud Controller Manager Operator.

For more information, see the xref:../operators/operator-reference.adoc#cluster-cloud-controller-manager-operator_cluster-operators-ref[Cluster Cloud Controller Manager Operator] entry in the _Cluster Operators reference_.

== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.9 and beyond!
* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])

== Asynchronous errata updates

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for {product-title} {product-version} are released as asynchronous errata through the Red Hat Network. All {product-title} {product-version} errata is https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[available on the Red Hat Customer Portal]. See the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} Life Cycle] for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account settings for Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications are enabled, users are notified through email whenever new errata relevant to their registered systems are released.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming {product-title} entitlements for {product-title} errata notification emails to generate.
====

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of {product-title} {product-version}. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form {product-title} {product-version}.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any {product-title} release, always review the instructions on xref:../updating/updating_a_cluster/updating-cluster-web-console.adoc#updating-cluster-web-console[updating your cluster] properly.
