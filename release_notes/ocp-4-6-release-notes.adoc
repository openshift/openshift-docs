[id="ocp-4-6-about-this-release"]
== About this release

Red Hat {product-title}
(link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2020:1234[RHBA-2020:1234]) is now
available. This release uses link:https://v1-18.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/[Kubernetes 1.18] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to
{product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

//Red Hat did not publicly release {product-title} 4.5.0 as the GA version and,
//instead, is releasing {product-title} 4.5.1 as the GA version.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at
https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift. The {cloud-redhat-com}
application for {product-title} allows you to deploy OpenShift clusters to
either on-premise or cloud environments.

{product-title} {product-version} is supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 or
later, as well as {op-system-first} 4.5.

You must use {op-system} for the control plane, which are also known as master machines, and
can use either {op-system} or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 or later for
compute machines, which are also known as worker machines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because only Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 7.7 or later is supported for compute
machines, you must not upgrade the Red Hat Enterprise Linux compute machines to
version 8.
====

With the release of {product-title} 4.6, version 4.3 is now end of life. For
more information, see the
link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy].

[id="ocp-4-6-new-features-and-enhancements"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

[id="ocp-4-6-security"]
=== Security

[id="ocp-4-6-oauth-token-inactivity-timeout"]
==== Configure OAuth token inactivity timeout

You can now configure OAuth tokens to expire after a certain amount of time that they have been inactive. By default, there is no token inactivity timeout set. You can configure the timeout for the internal OAuth server and for OAuth clients.

See xref:../authentication/configuring-internal-oauth.adoc#oauth-token-inactivity-timeout_configuring-internal-oauth[Configuring token inactivity timeout for the internal OAuth server] and xref:../authentication/configuring-oauth-clients.adoc#oauth-token-inactivity-timeout_configuring-oauth-clients[Configuring token inactivity timeout for an OAuth client] for more information.

[id="ocp-4-6-oauth-token-storage"]
==== Secure OAuth token storage format

OAuth access token and OAuth authorize token object names are now stored as non-sensitive object names.

Previously, secret information was used as the OAuth access token and OAuth authorize token object names. When etcd is encrypted, only the value is encrypted, so this sensitive information was not encrypted.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are upgrading your cluster to {product-title} 4.6, old tokens from {product-title} 4.5 will still have the secret information exposed in the object name. By default, the expiration for tokens is 24 hours, but this setting can be changed by administrators. Sensitive data can still be exposed until all old tokens have either expired or have been deleted by an administrator.
====

[id="ocp-4-6-web-console"]
=== Web console

[id="ocp-4-6-web-console-improved-upgrade-experience"]
==== Improved upgrade experience in the web console

* Administrators are now better informed about the differences between the upgrade
channels by helpful text and links in the web console.
* A link to the list of bug fixes and enhancements is now included for each minor
or patch release.
* There is now a visual representation of the different upgrade paths.
* Alerts now inform administrators when new patch releases, new minor releases,
and news channels become available.

[id="ocp-4-6-web-console-improved-operator-installation-workflow"]
==== Improved Operator installation workflow with OperatorHub

When administrators install Operators with OperatorHub, they now get immediate
feedback to ensure that the Operator is installing properly.

[id="ocp-4-6-web-console-improved-operand-details-view"]
==== Improved operand details view

You can now see the schema grouping of `specDescriptor` fields and the status of
your Operands on the operand's details view, so that you can easily see the
status and configure the `spec` of the operand instance.

[id="ocp-4-6-web-console-view-operators-related-objects"]
==== View related objects for cluster Operators

Previously, when viewing a cluster Operator, it was not clear what resources the
Operator was associated with. When troubleshooting a cluster Operator, it could
be challenging to locate the logs for all the resources that the Operator
managed, which might be needed for troubleshooting. Now, with {product-title}
{product-version}, you can expose a list of related objects of a cluster
Operator and easily review one of the related objects' details or YAML code for
troubleshooting.

[id="ocp-4-6-web-console-warning-messages-when-editing-managed-resources"]
==== Warning messages when editing managed resources

Some resources are managed, such an Operator managed by a deployment, route,
service, or ConfigMap. Users are discouraged from editing these resources.
Instead, users should edit the custom resources for the Operator and its
operand, and expect the Operator to update its related resources. With this
update:

* A *Managed by* label now appears to the right of the resource name with a
clickable resource link for the managing resource.
* When the resource is modified or deleted, a message appears warning the user
that their changes might be reverted.
* An Operator developer can now specify a custom message to appear using an
annotation, guiding the user on what resource the user should edit.

[id="ocp-4-6-web-console-specDescriptor-supports-CRD-instance"]
====  The `k8sResourcePrefix` specDescriptor supports CRD instance

Operator authors, maintainers, and providers can now specify the
`k8sResourcePrefix` specDescriptor with `Group/Version/Kind` for assigning a CRD
resource type besides Kubernetes core API.

For more information, see
link:https://github.com/openshift/console/blob/master/frontend/packages/operator-lifecycle-manager/src/components/descriptors/reference/reference.md[OLM
Descriptor Reference].

[id="ocp-4-6-web-console-column-management"]
==== Column management on resources page

A *Manage columns* icon image:manage-columns.png[title="Manage Columns icon"] is
now added to some resources pages, for example the Pods page. When you click on
the icon, default column names are listed with check boxes on the left side of
the modal and additional column names are listed on the right. Deselecting a
check box will remove that column from the table view. Selecting a check box
will add that column to the table view. A maximum combination of nine columns
from both sides of the modal are available for display at one time. Clicking
*Save* will save the changes that you make. Clicking *Restore Default Columns*
will restore the default settings of the columns.

[id="ocp-4-6-scale"]
=== Scale

[id="ocp-4-6-scale-cluster-maximums"]
==== Cluster maximums

Updated guidance around
xref:../scalability_and_performance/planning-your-environment-according-to-object-maximums.adoc#planning-your-environment-according-to-object-maximums[cluster
maximums] for {product-title} {product-version} is now available.

Use the link:https://access.redhat.com/labs/ocplimitscalculator/[{product-title}
Limit Calculator] to estimate cluster limits for your environment.

[id="ocp-4-6-scale-real-time-profile-added-to-node-tuning-operator"]
==== Real-time profile added to the Node Tuning Operator

Partial Tuned real-time profile support became available in {product-title} 4.4.
Now, the real-time profiles are fully compatible with what the real-time
profiles do in Tuned on {op-system-base-full}.


[id="ocp-4-6-networking"]
=== Networking

[id="ocp-4-6-pod-network-connectivity-checks"]
==== Pod network connectivity checks

Operators can now configure `PodNetworkConnectivityCheck` resources to check each network connection from the Pods that are managed by the Operator. This allows you to more easily identify and troubleshoot issues with important network connections in your cluster.

This resource keeps track of the latest reachable condition, the last 10 successes, the last 10 failures, and details about detected outages. The results are also logged and events are created when outages are detected and resolved.

By default, the following network connections are checked:

* Between the Kubernetes API server and:
** the OpenShift API server service
** each OpenShift API server endpoint
** each etcd endpoint
** the internal API load balancer
** the external API load balancer

* Between the OpenShift API server and:
** the Kubernetes API server service
** each Kubernetes API server endpoint
** each etcd endpoint
** the internal API load balancer
** the external API load balancer

[id="ocp-4-6-operators"]
=== Operators

[id="ocp-4-6-metering-operator"]
==== Configuring a retention period of metering Reports

You can now set a retention period on a metering Report. The metering Report custom resource
has a new `expiration` field. If the `expiration` duration value is set on a Report,
and no other Reports or ReportQueries depend on the expiring Report, the Metering Operator
removes the Report from your cluster at the end of its retention period.
//For more information, see metering ../../metering/reports/metering-about-reports.adoc#metering-expiration_metering-about-reports[Reports expiration].

[id="ocp-4-6-notable-technical-changes"]
== Notable technical changes

{product-title} 4.6 introduces the following notable technical changes.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-6-ovn-k8s-default-cni-np-uses-ovs-on-cluster-nodes"]
==== OVN-Kubernetes default CNI network provider now uses OVS installed on cluster nodes

The OVN-Kubernetes default Container Network Interface (CNI) network provider now uses the Open vSwitch (OVS) version installed on the cluster nodes. Previously, OVS ran in a container on each node, managed by a DaemonSet. Using the host OVS eliminates any possible downtime from upgrading the containerized version of OVS.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-6-warnings-when-using-deprecated-apis"]
==== Warnings when using deprecated APIs

Warnings are now visible in `client-go` and `oc` on every invocation against a
deprecated API. Calling a deprecated API returns a warning message containing
the target Kubernetes removal release and replacement API, if applicable.

For example:

[source,terminal]
----
warnings.go:67] batch/v1beta1 CronJob is deprecated in v1.22+, unavailable in v1.25+
----

This is new functionality included with Kubernetes 1.19.

[id="ocp-4-6-deprecated-removed-features"]
== Deprecated and removed features

Some features available in previous releases have been deprecated or removed.

Deprecated functionality is still included in {product-title} and continues to
be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of this product
and is not recommended for new deployments. For the most recent list of major
functionality deprecated and removed within {product-title} {product-version},
refer to the table below. Additional details for more fine-grained functionality
that has been deprecated and removed are listed after the table.

[id="ocp-4-6-known-issues"]
== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.7 and beyond!
* In {product-title} 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.
+
If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.1 to 4.6, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. It is recommended to revoke unauthenticated access unless there is a specific need for it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP 403 errors if you revoke unauthenticated access.
====
+
Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:
+
[source,bash]
----
## Snippet to remove unauthenticated group from all the cluster role bindings
$ for clusterrolebinding in cluster-status-binding discovery system:basic-user system:discovery system:openshift:discovery ;
do
### Find the index of unauthenticated group in list of subjects
index=$(oc get clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} -o json | jq 'select(.subjects!=null) | .subjects | map(.name=="system:unauthenticated") | index(true)');
### Remove the element at index from subjects array
oc patch clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} --type=json --patch "[{'op': 'remove','path': '/subjects/$index'}]";
done
----
+
This script removes unauthenticated subjects from the following cluster role bindings:
+
--
** `cluster-status-binding`
** `discovery`
** `system:basic-user`
** `system:discovery`
** `system:openshift:discovery`
--
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821771[*BZ#1821771*])

* Running the `operator-sdk new` or `operator-sdk create api` commands without the
`--helm-chart` flag builds a Helm-based Operator that uses the default
boilerplate Nginx chart. While this example chart works correctly on upstream
Kubernetes, it fails to deploy successfully on {product-title}.
+
To work around this issue, use the `--helm-chart` flag to provide a Helm chart
that deploys successfully on {product-title}. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ operator-sdk new <operator_name> --type=helm \
  --helm-chart=<repo>/<name>
----
+
