cloud application platform for deploying both new and existing applications on
secure, scalable resources with minimal configuration and management overhead.

enterprise-class applications, while delivering integrated application runtimes
and libraries. {product-title} enables organizations to meet security, privacy,
compliance, and governance requirements.

[id="ocp-4-6-about-this-release"]
== About this release

Red Hat {product-title}
(link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2020:1234[RHBA-2020:1234]) is now
available. This release uses link:https://v1-18.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/[Kubernetes 1.18] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to
{product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

//Red Hat did not publicly release {product-title} 4.5.0 as the GA version and,
//instead, is releasing {product-title} 4.5.1 as the GA version.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at
https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift. The {cloud-redhat-com}
application for {product-title} allows you to deploy OpenShift clusters to
either on-premise or cloud environments.

{product-title} {product-version} is supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 or
later, as well as {op-system-first} 4.5.

You must use {op-system} for the control plane, which are also known as master machines, and
can use either {op-system} or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 or later for
compute machines, which are also known as worker machines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because only Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 7.7 or later is supported for compute
machines, you must not upgrade the Red Hat Enterprise Linux compute machines to
version 8.
====

With the release of {product-title} 4.6, version 4.3 is now end of life. For
more information, see the
link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy].

[id="ocp-4-6-new-features-and-enhancements"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.


[id="ocp-4-6-security"]
=== Security

[id="ocp-4-6-oauth-token-storage"]
==== Secure OAuth token storage format

OAuth access token and OAuth authorize token object names are now stored as non-sensitive object names.

Previously, secret information was used as the OAuth access token and OAuth authorize token object names. When etcd is encrypted, only the value is encrypted, so this sensitive information was not encrypted.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are upgrading your cluster to {product-title} 4.6, old tokens from {product-title} 4.5 will still have the secret information exposed in the object name. By default, the expiration for tokens is 24 hours, but this setting can be changed by administrators. Sensitive data can still be exposed until all old tokens have either expired or have been deleted by an administrator.
====

[id="ocp-4-6-notable-technical-changes"]
== Notable technical changes

{product-title} 4.6 introduces the following notable technical changes.

[id="ocp-4-6-ovn-k8s-default-cni-np-uses-ovs-on-cluster-nodes"]
==== OVN-Kubernetes default CNI network provider now uses OVS installed on cluster nodes

The OVN-Kubernetes default Container Network Interface (CNI) network provider now uses the Open vSwitch (OVS) version installed on the cluster nodes. Previously, OVS ran in a container on each node, managed by a DaemonSet. Using the host OVS eliminates any possible downtime from upgrading the containerized version of OVS.
