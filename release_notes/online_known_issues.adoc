== Authorization Headers Dropped When Pushing to a Registry via its External Route

Authorization headers are dropped when pushing to a registry via its external
route, in cases where the router is behind a load balancer. As a result, the
registry receives the push request without authorization details, causing an
*unauthorized* error and push failure.

[[BZ1439614-resolution-or-workaround]]
==== Resolution or Workaround

Include the route's port in the `push` command and in the `docker login`
command. For example:

----
$ docker login  registry.clusterid.openshift.com:443; docker push registry.clusterid.openshift.com:443/path/to/image
----

The push will succeed when the port is included in the Docker commands.
