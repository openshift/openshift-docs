Do not add or edit release notes here. Edit release notes directly in the branch
that they are relevant for.

Release notes should be added or edited in their own PR.

Add a release note "stub" file for each enterprise version to the `main` branch. Stubs are necessary when a writer adds a link to a release note `.adoc` file that is on the `main` branch.
