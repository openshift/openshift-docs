[id="ocp-4-11-nvme-cli"]
==== Support for NVMe over Fabrics

{product-title} 4.11 introduces the `nvme-cli` package that provides an interface for communicating with NVMe disks using host software capabilities.

[id="ocp-4-11-installation-and-upgrade"]
=== Installation and upgrade

[id="ocp-4-11-aws-serial-console-logs"]
==== Troubleshooting bootstrap failures during installation on AWS
The installer now gathers serial console logs from the bootstrap and control plane hosts on AWS. This log data is added to the standard bootstrap log bundle.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing-troubleshooting.adoc#installation-bootstrap-gather_installing-troubleshooting[Troubleshooting installation issues].

[id="ocp-4-11-installation-and-upgrade-hyperv"]
==== Support for Microsoft Hyper-V generation version 2
By default, the installation program now deploys a Microsoft Azure cluster using Hyper-V generation version 2 virtual machines (VMs). If the installation program detects that the instance type selected for the VMs does not support version 2, it uses version 1 for the deployment.

[id="ocp-4-11-worker-nodes"]
==== Default AWS and VMware vSphere compute node resources
Beginning with {product-title} 4.11, by default, the installation program now deploys AWS and VMware vSphere compute nodes with 4 vCPUs and 16 GB of virtual RAM.

[id="ocp-4-11-aws-sc2s"]
==== Support for the AWS SC2S region
{product-title} 4.11 introduces support for the AWS Secret Commercial Cloud Services (SC2S) region. You can now install and update {product-title} clusters in the `us-isob-east-1` SC2S region.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-secret-region.adoc#installing-aws-secret-region[Installing a cluster on AWS into a Secret or Top Secret Region]

[id="ocp-4-11-nutanix"]
==== Installing a cluster on Nutanix using installer-provisioned infrastructure
{product-title} 4.11 introduces support for installing a cluster on Nutanix using installer-provisioned infrastructure. This type of installation lets you use the installation program to deploy a cluster on infrastructure that the installation program provisions and the cluster maintains.

//For more information, see ../installing/installing_nutanix/installing-nutanix-installer-provisioned.adoc#installing-nutanix-installer-provisioned[Installing a cluster on Nutanix].

[id="ocp-4-11-azure-ultrassd"]
==== Installing {product-title} using Azure Ultra SSD
You can now enable Ultra SSD storage when installing {product-title} on Azure. This feature requires that both the Azure region and zone where you install {product-title} offer Ultra storage.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-customizations.html#installation-configuration-parameters-additional-azure_installing-azure-customizations[Additional Azure configuration parameters].

[id="ocp-4-11-bootstrapExternalStaticIP_{context}"]
==== Added support for bootstrapExternalStaticIP and bootstrapExternalStaticGateway configuration settings

When deploying an installer-provisioned {product-title} cluster on bare metal with static IP addresses and no DHCP server on the `baremetal` network, you must specify a static IP address for the bootstrap VM and the static IP address of the gateway for the bootstrap VM. {product-title} {product-version} provides the `bootstrapExternalStaticIP` and the `bootstrapExternalStaticGateway` configuration settings, which you can set in the `install-config.yaml` file before deployment. The introduction of these settings replaces the workaround procedure link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6850661[Assigning a bootstrap VM an IP address on the baremetal network without a DHCP server] from the {product-title} 4.10 release.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-installation-workflow.adoc#configuring-the-install-config-file_ipi-install-installation-workflow[Configuring the install-config.yaml file] and xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-installation-workflow.adoc#additional-install-config-parameters_ipi-install-installation-workflow[Additional install-config parameters].

[id="ocp-4-11-configuring-bios-raid-on-fujitsu-Hardware_{context}"]
==== Configuring Fujitsu hardware
{product-title} {product-version} introduces support for configuring the BIOS and RAID arrays of control plane nodes when installing {product-title} on bare metal with Fujitsu hardware. In {product-title} 4.10, configuring the BIOS and RAID arrays on Fujitsu hardware was limited to worker nodes.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-installation-workflow.adoc#configuring-the-bios_ipi-install-installation-workflow[Configuring the BIOS] and xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-installation-workflow.adoc#configuring-the-raid_ipi-install-installation-workflow[Configuring the RAID].

==== New option for Ingress Controllers with the hostnetwork endpoint

This update introduces a new option for Ingress Controllers with the `hostnetwork` endpoint strategy. You can now host multiple Ingress Controllers on the same worker node using `httpPort`, `httpsPort`, and `statsPort` binding ports.

[id="ocp-4-11-ne-clb-timeouts"]
==== Support for configuring Classic Load Balancer Timeouts on AWS
You can now configure idle connection timeouts for AWS Classic Load Balancers (CLBs) in the Ingress Controller.

For more information, see xref:../networking/configuring_ingress_cluster_traffic/configuring-ingress-cluster-traffic-aws.adoc#nw-configuring-clb-timeouts_configuring-ingress-cluster-traffic-aws[Configuring Classic Load Balancer timeouts]

[id="ocp-4-11-ne-tuningoptions-maxconnections"]
==== Support for configuring maximum number of connections for HAProxy processes
You can now set the maximum number of simultaneous connections that can be established per HAProxy process in the Ingress Controller to any value between 2000 and 2,000,000.

For more information, see xref:../networking/ingress-operator.adoc#nw-ingress-controller-configuration-parameters_configuring-ingress[Ingress Controller configuration parameters].

[id="ocp-4-11-coredns-forwarding-DNS-requests-over-TLS"]
==== Support for CoreDNS forwarding DNS requests over TLS

When working in a highly regulated environment, you might need the ability to secure domain name system (DNS) traffic when forwarding requests to upstream resolvers so that you can ensure additional DNS traffic and data privacy. Cluster administrators can now configure transport layer security (TLS) for forwarded DNS queries. This feature applies only to the DNS Operator and not the CoreDNS instance managed by the Machine Config Operator.

For more information, see xref:../networking/dns-operator.adoc#nw-dns-forward_dns-operator[Using DNS forwarding].

[id="ocp-4-11-ovn-internal-traffic-policy-support"]
==== Internal traffic support for OVN-Kubernetes

As a cluster administrator, you can configure `internalTrafficPolicy=Local` on a Kubernetes service object when using the OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) cluster network provider. This feature allows cluster administrators to route traffic to an endpoint on the same node that the traffic originated from. If there are no local node endpoints, traffic will be dropped.

For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service-traffic-policy[Service Internal Traffic Policy].

[id="ocp-4-11-routes-spec-subdomain-field"]
==== Enhancement to the Route API

Previously, you could not specify the subdomain of a route, and the `spec.host` field was required to set the host name. You can now specify the `spec.subdomain` field and omit the `spec.host` field of a route. The router deployment that exposes the route will use the `spec.subdomain` value to determine the host name.

You can use this enhancement to simplify sharding by enabling a route to have multiple, distinct host names determined by each router deployment that exposes the route.

[id="ocp-4-11-external-dns-operator"]
==== External DNS Operator

In {product-title} 4.11, the External DNS Operator is available for AWS Route53, Azure DNS, GCP DNS, and Infoblox in General Availability (GA) status. The External DNS Operator is still in Technology Preview (TP) status for BlueCat and AWS Route53 on GovCloud.
With this update, the External DNS Operator provides the following enhancements:

* You can create DNS records on a DNS zone on Infoblox.
* By default, the External DNS Operator creates the operands in the namespace `external-dns-operator`. You do not have to manually create a namespace for the operands and Role-based access control (RBAC) prior to installation.
* You can use the status of the route to retrieve the DNS FQDN names.
* The proxy support for BlueCat DNS provider is now available.
* You can enable the automatic DNS configuration deployment while using the BlueCat DNS provider.

Ensure that you migrate from TP to GA. The upstream version of `ExternalDNS` for an {product-title} 4.11 is `v0.12.0` and for the TP is `v0.10.2`.
For more information, see xref:../networking/external_dns_operator/nw-installing-external-dns-operator-on-cloud-providers.adoc#nw-installing-external-dns-operator-on-cloud-providers[About the External DNS Operator].

==== Descheduler now defaults to simulating pod evictions

By default, the descheduler now runs in predictive mode, which means that it only simulates pod evictions. You can review the descheduler metrics to view details about pods that would be evicted.

To evict pods instead of simulating the evictions, change the descheduler mode to automatic.

[id=ocp-4-11-enhance-scaleup-operations-etcd-clusters]
==== Enhancement to scale-up operations for etcd clusters
The Raft algorithm allows for scaling of etcd members using a new `learner` state. As a result, maintaining cluster quorum, adding and removing new members, and promoting `learners` occur without disrupting the cluster operation.

[id=ocp-4-11-enabling-assisted-installer-service-on-bare-metal_{context}]
{product-title} 4.11 introduces the `imageStorage` option as part of the `AgentServiceConfig` custom resource. This option improves application performance by allowing the user to specify persistent storage claim details for use with the image service.

The `releaseImage` parameter of the `ClusterImageSet` custom resource now supports operating system image version identification. The discovery ISO is based on an operating system image version as the releaseImage, or the latest version if the specified version is unavailable.

The `openshiftVersion` parameter of the `AgentServiceConfig` custom resource (CR) now supports either "x.y" (major.minor) or "x.y.z" (major.minor.patch) formats.

[id=ocp-4-11-ne-livenessProbe-readinessProbe-startupProbe-timeout-configuration]
// This is a 4.11 Network Edge feature that is located in the Scalability and Performance area of the docs, requested to be placed here by Miciah Masters -Sara T.
==== Configuring Ingress Controller (router) Liveness, Readiness, and Startup probes
{product-title} 4.11 introduces the ability to configure the timeout values for the kubelet’s liveness, readiness, and startup probes for router deployments that are managed by the OpenShift Container Platform ingress operator. The ability to set larger timeout values can reduce the risk of unnecessary and unwanted restarts that are caused by short default timeout of 1 second.

== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.8 and beyond! This needs some SME/QE review before being updated for 4.11. Need to check if KI should be removed or should stay.
* In {product-title} 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.
+
If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.1 to 4.8, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. Unless there is a specific need for unauthenticated access, you should revoke it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP `403` errors if you revoke unauthenticated access.
====
+
Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:
+
[source,bash]
----
## Snippet to remove unauthenticated group from all the cluster role bindings
$ for clusterrolebinding in cluster-status-binding discovery system:basic-user system:discovery system:openshift:discovery ;
do
### Find the index of unauthenticated group in list of subjects
index=$(oc get clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} -o json | jq 'select(.subjects!=null) | .subjects | map(.name=="system:unauthenticated") | index(true)');
### Remove the element at index from subjects array
oc patch clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} --type=json --patch "[{'op': 'remove','path': '/subjects/$index'}]";
done
----
+
This script removes unauthenticated subjects from the following cluster role bindings:
+
--
** `cluster-status-binding`
** `discovery`
** `system:basic-user`
** `system:discovery`
** `system:openshift:discovery`

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.9 and beyond!
* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])

== Asynchronous errata updates

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for {product-title} {product-version} are released as asynchronous errata through the Red Hat Network. All {product-title} {product-version} errata is https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[available on the Red Hat Customer Portal]. See the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} Life Cycle] for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account settings for Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications are enabled, users are notified through email whenever new errata relevant to their registered systems are released.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming {product-title} entitlements for {product-title} errata notification emails to generate.
====

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of {product-title} {product-version}. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form {product-title} {product-version}.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any {product-title} release, always review the instructions on xref:../updating/updating-cluster-within-minor.adoc#updating-cluster-within-minor[updating your cluster] properly.
