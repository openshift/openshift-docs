[id="ocp-4-11-networking"]
=== Networking
==== Pod-level bonding for secondary networks

Bonding at the pod level is vital to enable workloads inside pods that require high availability and more throughput. With pod-level bonding, you can create a bond interface from multiple single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) virtual function interfaces in kernel mode interface. The SR-IOV virtual functions are passed into the pod and attached to a kernel driver.

Scenarios where pod-level bonding is required include creating a bond interface from multiple SR-IOV virtual functions on different physical functions. Creating a bond interface from two different physical functions on the host can be used to achieve high availability at pod level.

For more information, see xref:../networking/hardware_networks/using-pod-level-bonding.adoc#nw-sriov-cfg-bond-interface-with-virtual-functions_using-pod-level-bonding[Configuring a bond interface from two SR-IOV interfaces]

[id="ocp-4-11-configuring-interface-level-safe-network-sysclts"]
==== Support for configuring interface-level safe network sysctls
Use the new `tuning-cni` meta plugin to set an interface level safe network sysctls that only applies to a specific interface. For example, you can change the behavior of `accept_redirects` on a particular network interface by configuring the `tuning-cni` plugin. A complete list of the interface-specific safe sysclts that can be set is available in the documentation.

In addition to this enhancement the set of system-wide safe sysctls that can be set has increased to support `net.ipv4.ping_group_range` and `net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start`.

For more information about configuring the `tuning-cni` plugin, see xref:../networking/setting-interface-level-network-sysctls.adoc#nodes-setting-interface-level-network-sysctls[Setting interface level network sysctls].

[id="ocp-4-11-coredns-forwarding-DNS-requests-over-TLS"]
==== Support for CoreDNS forwarding DNS requests over TLS

When working in a highly regulated environment, you might need the ability to secure domain name system (DNS) traffic when forwarding requests to upstream resolvers so that you can ensure additional DNS traffic and data privacy. Cluster administrators can now configure transport layer security (TLS) for forwarded DNS queries. This feature applies only to the DNS Operator and not the CoreDNS instance managed by the Machine Config Operator.

For more information, see xref:../networking/dns-operator.adoc#nw-dns-forward_dns-operator[Using DNS forwarding].

[id="ocp-4-11-ovn-internal-traffic-policy-support"]
==== Internal traffic support for OVN-Kubernetes

As a cluster administrator, you can configure `internalTrafficPolicy=Local` on a Kubernetes service object when using the OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) cluster network provider. This feature allows cluster administrators to route traffic to an endpoint on the same node that the traffic originated from. If there are no local node endpoints, traffic will be dropped.

For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service-traffic-policy[Service Internal Traffic Policy].

[id="ocp-4-11-alb-operator-support"]

[id="ocp-4-11-routes-spec-subdomain-field"]
==== Enhancement to the Route API

Previously, you could not specify the subdomain of a route, and the `spec.host` field was required to set the host name. You can now specify the `spec.subdomain` field and omit the `spec.host` field of a route. The router deployment that exposes the route will use the `spec.subdomain` value to determine the host name.

You can use this enhancement to simplify sharding by enabling a route to have multiple, distinct host names determined by each router deployment that exposes the route.

[id="ocp-4-11-external-dns-operator"]
==== External DNS Operator

In {product-title} 4.11, the External DNS Operator is available for AWS Route53, Azure DNS, GCP DNS, and Infoblox in General Availability (GA) status. The External DNS Operator is still in Technology Preview (TP) status for BlueCat and AWS Route53 on GovCloud.
With this update, the External DNS Operator provides the following enhancements:

* You can create DNS records on a DNS zone on Infoblox.
* By default, the External DNS Operator creates the operands in the namespace `external-dns-operator`. You do not have to manually create a namespace for the operands and Role-based access control (RBAC) prior to installation.
* You can use the status of the route to retrieve the DNS FQDN names.
* The proxy support for BlueCat DNS provider is now available.
* You can enable the automatic DNS configuration deployment while using the BlueCat DNS provider.

[id=ocp-4-11-monitoring-changes-to-alerting-rules]
==== Changes to alerting rules

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat does not guarantee backward compatibility for recording rules or alerting rules.
====

* *New*
** Added the `KubePersistentVolumeInodesFillingUp` alert, which functions similarly to the existing `KubePersistentVolumeFillingUp` alert but is applied to inodes rather than volume space.
** Added the `PrometheusScrapeBodySizeLimitHit` alert to detect targets hitting the body size limit.
** Added the `PrometheusScrapeSampleLimitHit` alert to detect targets hitting the sample limit.

* *Changed*
** Fixed the `KubeDaemonSetRolloutStuck` alert to use the updated metric `kube_daemonset_status_updated_number_scheduled` from `kube-state-metrics`.
** Replaced the `KubeJobCompletion` alert with `KubeJobNotCompleted`. The new `KubeJobNotCompleted` alert avoids false positives when an earlier job failed but the most recent job succeeded.
** Updated the `NodeNetworkInterfaceFlapping` alert to exclude `tunbr` interfaces from the alert expression.

==== Use additional authentication settings for remote write configuration
You can now use the following authentication methods to access a remote write endpoint: AWS Signature Version 4, custom Authorization header, and OAuth 2.0.
Before this release, you could only use TLS client and basic authentication.

[id=ocp-4-11-monitoring-better-manage-promql-queries-in-web-console]
==== Create, browse, and manage PromQL queries more easily in the web console
The Query Browser on the *Observe* -> *Metrics* page of the {product-title} web console adds various enhancements to improve your ability to create, browse, and manage PromQL queries.
For example, administrators can now duplicate existing queries and use autocomplete suggestions when building and editing queries.

[id=ocp-4-11-monitoring-doubled-scrape-interval-for-servicemonitors-single-node]
====  Scrape interval doubled for ServiceMonitors in single node deployments
The scrape interval has been doubled for all Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) controlled ServiceMonitors on single-node {product-title} deployments.
The maximum interval is now two minutes.

[id=ocp-4-11-monitoring-create-alerting-rules-based-on-platform-metrics]
==== Create alerting rules based on platform monitoring metrics (Technology Preview)
This release introduces a Technology Preview feature in which administrators can create alerting rules based on existing platform monitoring metrics.
This feature helps administrators to more quickly and easily create new alerting rules specific to their environments.

[id=ocp-4-11-monitoring-add-cluster-id-labels-for-remote-write]
==== Add cluster ID labels to remote write storage
You can now add cluster ID labels to metrics being sent to remote write storage.
You can then query these labels to identify the source cluster for a metric and distinguish that metric data from similar metric data sent by other clusters.

[id=ocp-4-11-monitoring-query-metrics-using-federation-endpoint]
==== Query metrics using the federation endpoint for user workload monitoring
You can now use the Prometheus `/federate` endpoint to scrape user-defined metrics from a network location outside the cluster.
Before this release, you could only access the federation endpoint to scrape metrics in default platform monitoring.

[id=ocp-4-11-monitoring-enable-body-size-limit-metrics-scraping]
==== Enable body size limit for metrics scraping for default platform monitoring
You can now set the `enforcedBodySizeLimit` config map option for default platform monitoring to enable a body size limit on metrics scraping.
This setting triggers the new `PrometheusScrapeBodySizeLimitHit` alert when at least one Prometheus scrape target replies with a response body larger than the configured `enforcedBodySizeLimit`.
The setting can limit the impact that a malicious target can have on both the Prometheus component and on the cluster as a whole.

[id=ocp-4-11-monitoring-confgure-retention-size-for-metrics-storage]
==== Configure retention size settings for metrics storage
You can now configure the maximum amount of disk space reserved for retained metrics storage for both default platform monitoring and user-workload monitoring.
Before this release, you could not configure this setting.

[id=ocp-4-11-monitoring-confgure-retention-time-for-thanos-ruler]
==== Configure the retention time period for Thanos Ruler in user-defined projects
You can now configure the retention time period for Thanos Ruler data in user-defined projects.
Before this release, you could not change the default value of `24h`.

[id=ocp-4-11-workload-hints-for-nto]
==== Workload hints for the Node Tuning Operator
{product-title} 4.11 supports a hinting mechanism for the Node Tuning Operator that can tune `PerformanceProfile` to meet the demands of different industry environments. In this release, workload hints are available for `highPowerConsumption` (very low latency at the cost of increased power consumption) and `realtime` (priority given to optimum latency). A combination of true/false settings for these hints can be used to deal with application-specific workload profiles and requirements.

[id=ocp-4-11-enhance-scaleup-operations-etcd-clusters]
==== Enhancement to scale-up operations for etcd clusters
The Raft algorithm allows for scaling of etcd members using a new `learner` state. As a result, maintaining cluster quorum, adding and removing new members, and promoting `learners` occur without disrupting the cluster operation.

[id=ocp-4-11-enabling-assisted-installer-service-on-bare-metal_{context}]
{product-title} 4.11 introduces the `imageStorage` option as part of the `AgentServiceConfig` custom resource. This option improves application performance by allowing the user to specify persistent storage claim details for use with the image service.

The `releaseImage` parameter of the `ClusterImageSet` custom resource now supports operating system image version identification. The discovery ISO is based on an operating system image version as the releaseImage, or the latest version if the specified version is unavailable.

The `openshiftVersion` parameter of the `AgentServiceConfig` custom resource (CR) now supports either "x.y" (major.minor) or "x.y.z" (major.minor.patch) formats.

[id=ocp-4-11-ne-livenessProbe-readinessProbe-startupProbe-timeout-configuration]
// This is a 4.11 Network Edge feature that is located in the Scalability and Performance area of the docs, requested to be placed here by Miciah Masters -Sara T.
==== Configuring Ingress Controller (router) Liveness, Readiness, and Startup probes
{product-title} 4.11 introduces the ability to configure the timeout values for the kubelet’s liveness, readiness, and startup probes for router deployments that are managed by the OpenShift Container Platform ingress operator. The ability to set larger timeout values can reduce the risk of unnecessary and unwanted restarts that are caused by short default timeout of 1 second.

For more information see, xref:../scalability_and_performance/routing-optimization.adoc#configuring-ingress-controller-router-liveness-readiness-and-startup-probes[Configuring Ingress Controller (router) Liveness, Readiness, and Startup probes]

[id=ocp-4-11-nto-offlined-cpu]
==== New power reduction CPU capability

You can decrease power consumption through the Node Tuning Operator by specifying CPUs in the `offlined` field in the performance profile. For more information, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/cnf-low-latency-tuning.adoc#node-tuning-operator-disabling-CPUs-for-power-consumption_cnf-master[Reducing power consumption by taking CPUs offline].

[id=ocp-4-11-node-observability-operator]
==== Node Observability Operator (Technology Preview)
{product-title} 4.11 introduces the Node Observability Operator in Technology Preview.

The Node Observability Operator provides the ability to:

* Deploy Node Observability Agents on the worker nodes.
* Trigger a CRIO-O and Kubelet profiling.
* Make the profiling data files available for further analysis.

For more information, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/node-observability-operator.adoc#node-observability-operator[Requesting CRI-O and Kubelet profiling data using the Node Observability Operator].

[id="ocp-4-11-PAO-to-NTO"]
==== Performance Addon Operator functions moved to the Node Tuning Operator

In earlier versions of {product-title}, the Performance Addon Operator provided automatic, low latency performance tuning for applications. In {product-title} 4.11, these functions are part of the Node Tuning Operator. The Node Tuning Operator is part of the standard installation for {product-title} 4.11. If you upgrade to {product-title} 4.11, the Node Tuning Operator removes the Performance Addon Operator and all related artifacts on startup.

For more information, see xref:../operators/operator-reference.adoc#about-node-tuning-operator_platform-operators-ref[Node Tuning Operator].

[NOTE]
====
You must still use the `performance-addon-operator-must-gather` image when running the `must-gather` command with the Performance Profile Creator. For more information, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/cnf-create-performance-profiles.adoc#gathering-data-about-your-cluster-using-must-gather_cnf-create-performance-profiles[Gathering data about your cluster using must-gather]
====

[id="ocp-4-11-PAO-to-NTO-docs"]
==== Low latency tuning documentation updates

In earlier version of {product-title}, documentation for low latency tuning included references to the Performance Addon Operator. Since the Node Tuning Operator now provides low latency tuning, the documentation title changed from "Performance Addon Operator for low latency nodes" to "Low latency tuning", and multiple cross-references to this document were updated accordingly. For more information, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/cnf-low-latency-tuning.adoc#cnf-low-latency-tuning[Low latency tuning].

[id="ocp-4-11-SRO-hub-and-spoke"]
==== Hub and spoke cluster support

For hub and spoke deployments in which spoke clusters require out-of-tree driver support, you can use the Special Resource Operator (SRO) deployed in the hub cluster to manage the deployment of the required kernel module(s) to one or more managed clusters. This uses {rh-rhacm-first} and no longer requires the use of Node Feature Discovery (NFD). For more information, see xref:../hardware_enablement/psap-special-resource-operator.adoc#deploy-simple-kmod-using-crd[Building and running the simple-kmod SpecialResource for a hub-and-spoke topology].

[id="ocp-4-11-SRO-upgrade"]
====  Enhanced SRO cluster upgrade support

When upgrading a cluster in which special resources are being managed, you can run the pre-upgrade custom resource to verify that a new driver container exists to support a kernel update. This helps avoid possible disruption of managed special resources. The documentation for this feature is currently unavailable and is targeted for release at a later date.

[id="ocp-4-11-SRO-debugging-and-logging"]
====  Enhanced debugging and logging for SRO

The Special Resource Operator (SRO) includes a consistent log output format with greater message detail for troubleshooting.

[id="ocp-4-11-SRO-external-registries"]
====  Support for external registries

Before this update, SRO did not support connecting to registries in disconnected environments. This release provides support for disconnected environments for which the driver container is hosted in a registry outside of the {product-title} cluster.

[id="ocp-4-11-insights-operator"]
=== Insights Operator

==== Insights Operator data collection enhancements
In {product-title} {product-version}, the Insights Operator collects the following additional information:

* The `images.config.openshift.io` resource definition
* `kube-controller-manager` container logs when the `"Internal error occurred: error resolving resource"` or `"syncing garbage collector with updated resources from discovery"` error messages are present
* `storageclusters.ocs.openshift.io/v1` resources

With this additional information, Red Hat improves {product-title} functionality and enhances Insights Advisor recommendations.

[id="ocp-4-11-auth"]
=== Authentication and authorization

[id="ocp-4-11-auth-oidc-providers"]
==== Additional supported OIDC providers

The following OpenID Connect (OIDC) providers are now tested and supported with {product-title}:

* Active Directory Federation Services for Windows Server
+
[NOTE]
====
Currently, it is not supported to use Active Directory Federation Services for Windows Server with {product-title} when custom claims are used.
====

* Microsoft identity platform (Azure Active Directory v2.0)
+
[NOTE]
====
Currently, it is not supported to use Microsoft identity platform when group names are required to be synced.
====

For the full list of OIDC providers, see xref:../authentication/identity_providers/configuring-oidc-identity-provider.adoc#identity-provider-oidc-supported_configuring-oidc-identity-provider[Supported OIDC providers].

[id="ocp-4-11-auth-pod-security-admission"]
==== Pod security admission

link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/[Pod security admission] is now enabled on {product-title}.

Pod admission is enforced by both pod security and security context constraints (SCC) admissions. Pod security admission runs globally with `privileged` enforcement and `restricted` audit logging and API warnings.

A controller monitors the xref:../authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.adoc#managing-pod-security-policies[SCC-related permissions] of service accounts in user-created namespaces and automatically labels these namespaces with link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/[pod security admission] `warn` and `audit` labels.

To improve workload security in accordance with the `restricted` pod security profile, this release introduces SCCs that enforce pod security in accordance with new pod security admission controls. These SCCs are:

* `restricted-v2`
* `hostnetwork-v2`
* `nonroot-v2`

They correspond to older, similarly named SCCs, but with the following enhancements:

* `ALL` capabilities are dropped from containers. Previously, only the `KILL`, `MKNOD`, `SETUID`, and `SETGID` capabilities were dropped.
* The `NET_BIND_SERVICE` capability can now be added explicitly.
* `seccompProfile` is defaulted to `runtime/default` if unset. In previous releases, this field had to be empty.
* `allowPrivilegeEscalation` must be unset or set to `false` in security contexts. Previously, a `true` value was allowed.

In {product-title} 4.11, the `restricted-v2` SCC is now the default granted SCC available to users for new installations, instead of the `restricted` SCC. In new clusters, the `restricted-v2` SCC is used for any authenticated user in place of the `restricted` SCC. The `restricted` SCC is no longer available to users of new clusters, unless the access is explicitly granted. In clusters originally installed in {product-title} 4.10 or earlier, all authenticated users can use the `restricted` SCC when upgrading to {product-title} 4.11 and later. This keeps the default security permissions for {product-title} as secure-by-default and aligns with pod security admission and pod security standards from the upstream Kubernetes project, while keeping the permissions of upgraded clusters consistent with their previous state.

You can enable synchronization for most namespaces and disable synchronization for all namespaces.

For this release, namespaces that are prefixed with `openshift-` do not have restricted enforcement. Restricted enforcement for such namespaces is planned for inclusion in a future release.

For more information, see xref:../authentication/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission.adoc#understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission[Understanding and managing pod security admission].

== Notable technical changes

{product-title} {product-version} introduces the following notable technical changes.

// Note: use [discrete] for these sub-headings.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-11-router-load-balancing-algorithm-default-update"]
==== Update in default value for setting the router load-balancing algorithm

The `haproxy.router.openshift.io/balance` variable, which sets the router load-balancing algorithm, now defaults to the value `random` instead of `leastconn`. See xref:../networking/routes/route-configuration.adoc#nw-route-specific-annotations_route-configuration[Route-specific annotations] for more information.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-11-legacy-service-account"]
==== LegacyServiceAccountTokenNoAutoGeneration is on by default

To align with upstream link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md#urgent-upgrade-notes-1[Kubernetes having moved] the `LegacyServiceAccountTokenNoAutoGeneration` feature gate to beta and enabling it by default, {product-title} now also follows this security feature and releases with the feature enabled. As a result, when creating new service accounts (SA), a service account token secret is no longer automatically generated. Previously, {product-title} automatically added a service account token to a secret for each new SA.

If you need a service account token secret, you must manually use the TokenRequest API to request bound service account tokens or create a service account token secret.

After updating to {product-version}, existing service account token secrets are not deleted and continue to function as expected.

Service Account token secrets still appear as auto-generated in {product-title} 4.11. However, instead of two secrets per Service Account, there will now be only one, which will be further reduced to zero in a future release. These tokens do not work. For now, dockercfg secrets are still being generated as secrets and no secrets will be deleted during upgrades.

* For information about using the TokenRequest API, see xref:../authentication/bound-service-account-tokens.html#bound-sa-tokens-configuring_bound-service-account-tokens[Using bound service account tokens]

* For information about creating a service account token secret, see xref:../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-secrets.html#nodes-pods-secrets-creating-sa_nodes-pods-secrets[Creating a service account token secret].

[id="ocp-4-11-cluster-operators-naming"]
==== Cluster Operators no longer referred to as platform Operators

{product-title} documentation previously referred to cluster Operators interchangeably with the alternative naming "platform Operators". Because this double naming could cause confusion about the type of Operators being discussed, the term "platform Operator" is no longer used when referring to cluster Operators, which are represented by `ClusterOperator` API objects. The documentation sets for {product-title} {product-version} and earlier have been updated to now solely use the term "cluster Operator".

For example, see xref:../operators/operator-reference.adoc#cluster-operators-ref[Cluster Operators reference].

==== Support for deploying {sno} with OpenShiftSDN has been removed

Support for deploying {sno} clusters with OpenShiftSDN has been removed with this release. OVN-Kubernetes is the default networking solution for {sno} deployments.

==== Removal of Jenkins images from install payload

* {product-title} 4.11 moves the "OpenShift Jenkins" and "OpenShift Agent Base" images to the `ocp-tools-4` repository at `registry.redhat.io` so that Red Hat can produce and update the images outside the {product-title} lifecycle. Previously, these images were in the {product-title} install payload and the `openshift4` repository at `registry.redhat.io`. For more information, see xref:../cicd/jenkins/important-changes-to-openshift-jenkins-images.adoc#openshift-jenkins[OpenShift Jenkins].

* {product-title} 4.11 removes "OpenShift Jenkins Maven" and "NodeJS Agent" images from its payload. Previously, {product-title} 4.10 deprecated these images. Red Hat no longer produces these images, and they are not available from the `ocp-tools-4` repository at `registry.redhat.io`.
+
However, upgrading to {product-title} 4.11 does not remove "OpenShift Jenkins Maven" and "NodeJS Agent" images from 4.10 and earlier releases. And Red Hat provides bug fixes and support for these images through the end of the 4.10 release lifecycle, in accordance with the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} lifecycle policy].

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-11-bare-metal-hardware-bug-fixes"]
==== Bare Metal Hardware Provisioning

* Previously, when writing the RHCOS image onto some disks, the `qemu-img` was allocating space onto the entire disk, including sparse areas. This extended the time of the writing process on some hardware. This update disables the `qemu-img` sparse in image creation. As a result, the image writing would no longer take a long time on affected hardware. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2002009[*BZ#2002009*])

* Previously, if the `rotational` field was set for `RootDeviceHints`, the host could fail the provision. With this update, the `rotational` field in `RootDeviceHints` is properly copied and checked. As a result, the provisioning will succeed when using the `rotational` field. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2053721[*BZ#2053721*])

* Previously, Ironic was unable to use virtual media to provision Nokia OE 20 servers because the BMC required the `TransferProtocolType` attribute to be explicitly set in the request despite this being an optional attribute. Additionally, the BMC also required the use of a dedicated `RedFish` settings resource to override boot orders, whereas most BMCs just use the `system` resource. This error occurred because Nokia OE 20 strictly requires an optional `TransferProtocolType` attribute for vMedia attachments and requires the use of the `RedFish` settings resource for overriding boot sequences. Consequently, virtual media based provisioning would fail on Nokia OE 20. There are two workarounds for this issue:

. When the vMedia attachment request fails with an error indicating that the `TransferProtocolType` attribute is missing, retry the request and explicitly specify this attribute.
. Check for the presence of the RedFish settings resource in the system. If it is present, use it for the boot sequence override.

+
As a result to these workarounds, virtual media based provisioning will succeed on Nokia OE 20 machines. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2059567[*BZ#2059567*])

* Previously, the Ironic API inspector image failed to clean disks that were part of passive multipath setups when using {product-title} bare-metal IPI deployments. This update fixes the failures when active or passive storage arrays are in use. As a result, it is now possible to use {product-title} bare metal IPI when customers want to use multipath setups that are active or passive. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2089309[*BZ#2089309*])

* Previously, Ironic failed to match `wwn` serial numbers to multi-path devices. Consequently, `wwn` serial numbers for device mapper devices could not be used in the `rootDeviceHint` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` configuration file. With this update, Ironic now recognizes `wwn` serial numbers as unique identifiers for multi-path devices. As a result, it is now possible to use `wwn` serial numbers for device mapper devices for the `install-config.yaml` file. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2098392[*BZ#2098392*])

==== Builds

* Previously, using a forward slash (`/`) in the `ImageLabel` name of a `BuildConfig` instance resulted in an error. This fix resolves the issue by changing the utility used for validation. As a result, you can use a forward slash in the `ImageLabel` name of a `BuildConfig` instance. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2105167[*BZ#2105167*])

* Previously, when using the `$ oc new-app --search <image_stream_name>` command, you could receive an incorrect message related to `docker.io` images. This resulted in confusion for the user because {product-title} does not use image streams that point to `docker.io`. This fix adds code checks to prevent the reference to `docker.io`. As a result, the output from that command does not include the message. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049889[*BZ#2049889*])

* Previously, Shared Resource CSI Driver metrics were not exported to the Telemetry service. As a result, usage metrics for the Shared Resource CSI Driver could not be analyzed. With this fix, Shared Resource CSI Driver metrics are exposed to the Telemetry service. As a result, usage metrics for the Shared Resource CSI Driver can be collected and analyzed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2058225[*BZ#2058225*])

* By default, Buildah prints steps to the log file, including the contents of environment variables, which might include xref:../cicd/builds/creating-build-inputs.adoc#builds-input-secrets-configmaps_creating-build-inputs[build input secrets]. Although you can use the `--quiet` build argument to suppress printing of those environment variables, this argument isn't available if you use the source-to-image (S2I) build strategy. The current release fixes this issue. To suppress printing of environment variables, set the `BUILDAH_QUIET` environment variable in your build configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
sourceStrategy:
...
  env:
    - name: "BUILDAH_QUIET"
      value: "true"
----

* Before this update, using the `$ oc new-app --search <image_stream_name>` command provided a warning that you may not have access to the container image `"docker.io/library/<image_name>:<tag>"`. This caused confusion about {product-title} having image streams that pointed to `docker.io`. This update fixes the issue by adding code checks to prevent that confusing reference to 'docker.io'. Now, the output from that command does not include messages about `docker.io` (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049889[*BZ#2049889*])

==== Cloud Compute

* `CertificateSigningRequest` (CSR) resource renewal is handled by the Kubernetes controller manager and correctly left pending by the Cluster Machine Approver Operator, which increases the value of the `mapi_current_pending_csr` metric to `1`. Previously, when the  Kubernetes controller manager approved the CSR, the Operator ignored it and left the metric unchanged. As a result, the `mapi_current_pending_csr` metric was stuck at `1` until the Operator next reconciled. With this release, CSR approvals from other controllers are always reconciled to update metrics and the value of the `mapi_current_pending_csr` metric is updated after every reconcile. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2047702[*BZ#2047702*])

* Previously, only regions contained in a list of known regions within the AWS SDK were validated, and specifying any other region caused an error. This meant that, as new regions were added, they could not be used until the SDK was updated to contain the new region information. With this release, regions are validated with a less strict setting that warns the user when a region is not recognized. As a result, new regions might cause warning messages but can be used immediately. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2065510[*BZ#2065510*])

* Previously, the Cluster Machine Approver Operator appended the `"Approved"` status condition to its condition list. As a result, the Kubernetes API server logged errors containing the message `[SHOULD NOT HAPPEN] failed to update managedFields`. With this release, the Operator is updated to check its conditions before appending to the list, and only update the condition when necessary. As a result, the conditions are no longer duplicated in the `CertificateSigningRequest` resource and the Kubernetes API server no longer logs errors about the duplicate. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1978303[*BZ#1978303*])

* Previously, a defect in the Cisco ACI neutron implementation that was present in {rh-openstack-first} version 16, caused the query for subnets belonging to a given network to return unexpected results. As a result, the {rh-openstack} Cluster API provider might try to provision instances with duplicated ports on the same subnet, leading to a failed provisioning. With this release, additional filtering in the {rh-openstack} Cluster API provider ensures there is no more than one port per subnet, and it is now possible to deploy {product-title} on {rh-openstack} version 16 with Cisco ACI. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2033862[*BZ#2033862*])

* Previously, the {rh-openstack-first} Machine API provider did not use the proxy environment variable directives, causing installation behind an HTTP or HTTPS proxy to fail. With this release, the provider obeys proxy directives and functions correctly in a restricted environment in which egress traffic is only allowed through a proxy.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2046133[*BZ#2046133*])

* Previously, when upgrading from {product-title} 4.9 to 4.10, inconsistencies between multiple controllers resulted in incorrect version numbers. As a result, the version number was not consistent. With this release, consistent reading of version numbers has been enacted and the release version is now stable in the cluster operator status. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2059716[*BZ#2059716*])

* Previously, leaks of load balancer targets on AWS Machine API providers may occur. This is because IP-based load balancer attachments may remain within the load balancer registration when replacing control plane machines. With this release, IP-based load balancer attachments are removed from the load balancer before the Amazon EC2 instance is removed from AWS. As a result, the leaks are avoided. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2065160[*BZ#2065160*])

* Previously, during an upgrade, a new machine created through the Machine API defaulted to HW-13 which caused the cluster to degrade. With this release, the machine controller checks the virtual machine’s hardware version during machine creation from the template clone. The machine goes into a `failed` state if the template’s hardware version is less than 15, which is the minimal supported hardware version for {product-title} 4.11 and above versions. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2059338[*BZ#2059338*])

* Previously, the procedural name generator for Azure availability sets exceeded the 80 character maximum limit. This might cause the Machine API to reuse the same sets during the name truncation, rather than creating multiple availability sets. With this release, the procedural name generator is updated to ensure that the name is no longer than 80 characters and the cluster name is not duplicated in the set name. As a result, Azure availability sets are no longer truncated in unexpected ways by the procedural name generator. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2093044[*BZ#2093044*])

* Because the Cluster Autoscaler Operator was deploying the cluster autoscaler without setting any leader election parameters, the cluster autoscaler could unexpectedly fail and restart after a cluster restart. With this fix, the Cluster Autoscaler Operator now deploys the cluster autoscaler with well-defined leader election flags. As a result, the cluster autoscaler operates as expected after restarts. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2063194[*BZ#2063194*])"

* Previously, certificate signing request (CSR) renewal was handled by `kube-controller-manager` and correctly left pending by the machine approver, which increased `mapi_current_pending_csr` to `1`. Afterwards, the `kube-controller-manager` approved the CSR, but the machine approver would ignore it, which left the metric unchanged. Consequently, the `mapi_current_pending_csr` was stuck at `1` until another machine approver reconciled it. With this update, CSR approvals are reconciled from other controllers to update metrics properly. As a result, `mapi_current_pending_csr` is always up-to-date after every reconcile. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2072195[*BZ#2072195*])

* Previously, the Machine API Operator did not report as degraded if an insufficient number of worker nodes started upon cluster installation, even though other Operators were reported as degraded. With this release, the Machine API Operator is now reported as degraded and errors are posted in the installation log in this scenario. As a result, with the Machine API Operator appears in the list of failed Operators, and users now know to examine the state of the machines as the reason why there are insufficient worker nodes.(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1994820[*BZ#1994820*])

* Because the Machine API Operator did not honor the proxy environment variable directives, installation behind an HTTP or HTTPS proxy failed. With this fix, the HTTP transport logic of Machine API Operator now obeys proxy directives. As a result, the Machine API Operator now works in a restricted environment where egress traffic is only allowed through a proxy. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2082667[*BZ#2082667*])

* Previously, installations on vSphere for clusters with thousands of tags and heavy API loads were failing. Now, the machine controllers only query tags that are related to a particular {product-title} installation. As a result, {product-title} installs correctly on vSphere for these clusters. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2097153[*BZ#2097153*])

* Because the kubelet needs to contact the vCenter to obtain node zone labels, if the vCenter credentials are stored in a secret, the kubelet could not start because the kube client was not created on time. As a result, if you rebooted the nodes, as happens when you edit the `cloud-provider-config` config map, the nodes did not come up. With this fix, the kubelet now obtains zone labels after node registration if the credentials are stored in the secret. As a result, the nodes reboot as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1902307[*BZ#1902307*])

* Previously, the lack of a `timeout` option might have led to controller blockage, which could cause vCenter to never, or very slowly, respond. This release adds a `timeout` option for vCenter clients within the vSphere machine controller. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2083237[*BZ#2083237*])

==== Cluster Version Operator

* Previously, the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) when it encountered an error during an upgrade would stop reconciling current release manifests. With this update, release loading is separated from reconciling so the latter does not block the former and a new condition `ReleaseAccepted` has been added to clarify the status of the release load.

==== Console Metal3 Plugin

* Previously, there was a missing option in the UI to set the `bootMode` strategy. Consequently, the UI would always use the default (UEFI) boot strategy, which caused problems booting up some types of bare metals deployments. This update exposes a new field in the *Add Bare Metal* host form to choose the appropriate boot mode strategy. As a result, the bare metal machine properly starts. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2091030[*BZ#2091030*])

* Previously, the node maintenance feature was moved to a new project which resulted in API changes. Consequently, node maintenance stopped working. This update fixes the code to work properly with new APIs. As a result, node maintenance works again. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2090621[*BZ#2090621*])

* Previously, in some cases, day 2 workers on clusters created by the assisted installer are missing underlying bare metal hosts and machine resources. Consequently, the UI failed when trying to show details of the worker node. With this update, the bare metal hosts and machine resources are handled more gracefully, and the UI shows all available details.

[id="ocp-4-11-dns-bug-fixes"]
==== Domain Name System (DNS)

* Topology aware hints is a new feature in {product-title} {product-version} that allows the `EndpointSlice` controller to specify hints to the container network interface (CNI) for how it should route traffic to a service's endpoints. The DNS operator was not enabling topology aware hints for the cluster DNS service. Consequently, the CNI network providers did not keep DNS traffic local to the zone or node. With this fix, the DNS operator was updated to specify topology aware hints on the cluster DNS service. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2095941[*BZ#2095941*])

* Previously, the kubelet created a default `/etc/resolv.conf` for pods based on the `/etc/resolv.conf` from the node host. Consequently, the malformed `resolv.conf` file could cause resolvers to fail to parse `resolv.conf`, therefore breaking DNS resolution in pods. With this update, the kubelet accepts a `resolv.conf` file and pods get a valid `resolv.conf` file. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2063414[*BZ#2063414*])

* Previously, the DNS Operator did not set the `cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/enable-ds-eviction` annotation on DNS pods. Consequently, the cluster autoscaler did not remove the DNS pod from a node before removing the node. With this update, the DNS operator was changed to add the `cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/enable-ds-eviction` annotation to DNS pods. The DNS pod can now be removed from a node before removing the node by the cluster autoscaler. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2061244[*BZ#2061244*])

[id="ocp-4-11-image-registry-bug-fixes"]
==== Image Registry

* Previously, the image registry used an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` (ICSP) as a source only when it was an exact match. The same source file was expected to be pulled through for any subrepositories. The ICSP name and path did not match for subrepositories. As a result, the image was not used. Now, the ICSP is applied successfully to the subrepositories, which can use the mirrored images. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2014240[*BZ#2014240*])

* Previously, if the pruner failed, the image registry Operator is reported as degraded until the pruner successfully runs. With this update, the Operator is more resilient to the pruner failures. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1990125[*BZ#1990125*])

* Previously, the registry used exact match when applying `ImageContentSourcePolicy`(ICSP). With this update, ICSP is applied for subrepositories and mirrors now work as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2014240[*BZ#2014240*])

* Previously, the Image Registry Operator did not work with AWS S3 on {rh-openstack}. With this update, the Image Registry Operator trusts AWS S3 on all platforms. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=200761[*BZ#2007611*])

* Previously, {product-title} image registry did not work with Ceph Radosgw. With this update, the image registry works with Ceph Radosgw. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1976782[*BZ#1976782*])

* Previously, the Image Registry Operator interpreted `429` error messages from upstream registries as if the data was not available. The Operator returned a `404 Not Found` message instead of `429 Too Many Requests`. With this update, the proper `429 Too Many Requests` message is returned so that administrators know to retry the request. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1923536[*BZ#1923536*])

* Previously, the Image Registry Operator could not be used to configure CloudFront. With this update, the Image Registry Operator can configure CloudFront. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2065224[*BZ#2065224*])

* Previously, the Image Registry Operator pushed images when KMS encryption was enabled, but not pulled. With this update, images can be pushed and pulled with KMS encryption enabled. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2048214[*BZ#2048214*])

* Previously, the Image Registry Operator could not pull public images anonymously due to credentials not being provided. With this update, clients can pull public images anonymously. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2060605[*BZ#2060605*])

* Previously, the Image Registry Operator could not use the `ap-southeast-3` AWS region. With this update, the registry can be configured to `ap-southeast-3`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2065552[*BZ#2065552*])

[id="ocp-4-11-installer-bug-fixes"]
==== Installer

* Previously, if users specified an {product-title} cluster name with a period, the installation failed. This update adds a validation check to the installation program, which returns an error if a period is present in the cluster name. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2084580[*BZ#2084580*])

* Previously, users could select the AWS `us-gov-east-1` region when using the installation program to create the `install-config.yaml` file. This caused the deployment to fail because the installation program could only be used to create the `install-config.yaml` file for a public AWS region. This update removes all of the AWS regions from the installation program that are not supported by the public AWS cloud. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2048222[*BZ#2048222*])

* Previously, users could not select the `ap-north-east-3` region when using the installation program to create the `install-config.yaml` file. The AWS SDK that caused this problem has been updated, and users can now select the `ap-north-east-3` region. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1996544[*BZ#1996544*])

* Previously, installing a private (internal) {product-title} cluster on Azure Stack Hub failed because the installation program did not create the DNS record for the API virtual IP address. This update removes the invalid check that caused this problem. The installation program now correctly creates DNS records for private cluster. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2061549[*BZ#2061549*])

* Previously, uninstalling an IBM Cloud VPC cluster might have caused unexpected results. When a user uninstalled a cluster (cluster 1), the DNS records of another cluster (cluster 2) were removed when either the name of cluster 1 (example) was a subset of the name of cluster 2 (myexample) or both clusters shared a base domain. This update corrects this behavior. Only those resources specific to the cluster that is being uninstalled are now removed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2060617[*BZ#2060617*])

* Previously, Azure Stack Hub did not support any disk types other than Standard_LRS. This update adds the ability to customize disk types, which allows clusters to have a default disk type with no manual customizations. This resulted in making the switch from hard coding the disk type to accepting the inputs from the user and validating it against the Stack Hub APIs. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2061544[*BZ#2061544*])

* Previously, when destroying a cluster, the ID of the private route5 hosted zone for the cluster was incorrectly reported when the DNS records were deleted from the hosted zone. This caused incorrect host zone IDs to be reported in the log of the destroyer. This update uses the correct host zone ID in the log. As a result, the log shows the correct hosted zone ID when destroying the DNS record in the base domain's hosted zone. (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1965969[*BZ#1965969*])

* Previously, system proxy settings were not considered when requesting an AWS custom service endpoint. This update configures AWS custom service endpoint validation to consider the system proxy settings along with a `HEAD` request to the AWS custom service endpoint. As a result, the AWS custom service endpoint can be accessed from the user's machine. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2048451[*BZ#2048451*])

* Previously, the installation program used any Terraform provider in the `$PATH` on the installer host. Therefore, the installation would fail if there were Terraform providers in the `$PATH` that used an incorrect version or provider rather than the providers embedded in the installation program. With this update, the installation program embeds providers to a known directory and sets Terraform to use the known directory. As a result, installation will be successful because the installation program will always use the providers in the known directory. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1932812[*BZ#1932812*])

* Previously, there was an eventual consistency issue in the AWS Terraform provider when updating new load balancers. Therefore, the installation would fail when trying to access the new load balancers. With this fix, the installation program is now updated to an upstream Terraform provider, which ensures eventual consistency. As a result, the installation does not fail. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1898265[*BZ#1898265*])

* Previously, the installation program had a list of required APIs that check for quota and permissions, and the list contained some unnecessary APIs that failed if the user did not provide the permissions. With this update, The list of APIs is split into `required` and `optional` where the `optional` APIs are not accessible. A warning message is displayed for the `optional` APIs. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2084280[*BZ#2084280*])

* Previously, the `.apps` entry did not have the tag `kubernetes.io_cluster<infraID>` that was used by the installation program to delete code from the database that would isolate all the resources created for a given cluster and delete them. With this update, a tag was added to the cluster Ingress Operator during creation time which makes the entry visible to delete. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2055601[*BZ#2055601*])

* Previously, the `openshift-install` command would fail when using the internal publishing strategy. With this update, the `openshift-install` command no longer fails. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2047670[*BZ#2047670*])

* Previously, there was an eventual consistency issue in the AWS Terraform provider when updating to newly created Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). Consequently, the installation program would fail when attempting to access VPCs. With this update, the installation program is updated to the upstream Terraform provider and the install does not fail. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2043080[*BZ#2043080*])

* Previously, there was an eventual consistency issue in the AWS Terraform provider when updating to newly created network interfaces. Consequently, installs would fail to access the network interfaces. With this update, the Terraform provider is updated to accept eventual consistency and installation does not fail. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2047741[*BZ#2047741*])

* Previously, the `corespersocket` value could be higher than the `numCores` value when installing a VMware cluster using installer-provisioned infrastructure. This could cause unexpected results during installation. With this update, users receive a warning to correct these values before the cluster is created. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2034147[*BZ#2034147*])

* Previously, a rare bug caused inconsistency during AWS cluster installations. The installation program has been updated to avoid this scenario. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2046277[*BZ#2046277*])

* Previously, the number of supported user-defined tags was 8, and reserved {product-title} tags were 2 for AWS resources. With this release, the number of supported user-defined tags is now 25 and reserved {product-title} tags are 25 for AWS resources. You can now add up to 25 user tags during installation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CFE-592[*CFE#592*])

* Previously, the bootstrap machine used a default size and instance type when installing on Azure using installer-provisioned infrastructure. With this update, the bootstrap machine uses the size and instance type of the control plane machines. You can now control the size and instance type of the bootstrap machine by modifying the control plane settings in your installation configuration. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2026356[*BZ#2026356*])

* Previously, the installation program provided Terraform with an ambiguous network name. This could lead to Terraform being unable to determine the correct network to use. With this update, the installation program provides Terraform with a unique network ID so that the installation succeeds. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1918005[*BZ#1918005*])

* Previously, control plane machines could be created before the dependent NAT gateway was created when installing a cluster on AWS, causing the installation to fail. With this update, Terraform ensures that the NAT gateway has been created before the control plane machines are created. This ensures that the installation will succeed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049108[*BZ#2049108*])

* Previously, if you used an OVN network rather than the default OSN network, the scale-up task failed because it took longer than the maximum amount of time required. This update doubles the amount of retries during the scale-up task so that the task can be completed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2090151[*BZ#2090151*])

* Previously, when you tried to delete multiple clusters from the database in parallel, the deletion process failed because of a bug in the `vmware` and `govmomi` libraries. The bug caused one of the cluster's tags to be deleted, which resulted in a 404 error when the deletion process could not find the tag. This update ignores tags that aren't found and continues the deletion process so that it finishes without error. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2021041[*BZ#2021041*])

* With this update, {product-title} on {rh-virtualization-first} supports preallocated disks for control plane and worker nodes for installer-provisioned infrastructure. In high-load environments, preallocated disks benefit performance for etcd and other components. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2035334[*BZ#2035334*])

* Previously, when you tried to delete multiple clusters in parallel, the process failed because of a bug in the `vmware/govmomi` library. The bug caused a cluster tag to be deleted, which resulted in a `404` error when the deletion process could not find the tag. This update ignores tags that are not found and continues to delete so that it finishes without error. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2021041[*BZ#2021041*])

* Previously, installation methods for VMware vSphere included validation that checked for network existence during the creation of configuration files. This caused an error for user-provisioned infrastructure and other installation methods where the network can be created as part of provisioning the infrastructure, in which case the network might not exist when the config files are generated. This fix updates the installation program to only perform network validation on installer-provisioned infrastructure installs. As a result, user-provisioned infrastructure and other installation methods can generate configuration files regardless of network existence. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2050767[*BZ#2050767*])

* Previously, `runc` had an inversioned dependency on `libseccomp` 2.5 or later, which causes issues when the operating system was installed using version 8.3 or later and not fully updated to 8.4 or later. With this update, the {op-system-base} host installs successfully, avoiding issues with early versions of the package. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2060147[*BZ#2060147*])

* Previously, the installation program specified network resources to terraform by the relative path. When a network resource was nested in a folder, the terraform provider could not find the resource. With this update, network resources are now specified by ID, and the installation succeeds. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2063829[*BZ#2063829*])

* Previously, vSphere {op-system} images had no `/etc/resolv.conf` file. This caused the default `networkmanager` settings to display an error for `/etc/resolv.conf`. With this update, the `rc-manager=unmanaged` value is set, and the `networkmanager` settings do not direct to `/etc/resolv.conf`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2029438[*BZ#2029438*])

* Previously, the installation program did not create a cloud provider configuration because it is not required by Amazon Web Services (AWS). This caused the Kubernetes API server to provide an error without a cloud provider configuration. With this update, an empty cloud provider configuration for AWS is created, and the Kubernetes API server can run successfully.

==== Kubernetes API server

* Previously, long running requests used for streaming were taken into account for the `KubeAPIErrorBudgetBurn` calculation. Consequently, The alert from `KubeAPIErrorBudgetBurn` would be triggered and cause false positives. This update excludes long running requests from the `KubeAPIErrorBudgetBurn` calculation. As a result, false positives are reduced on the `KubeAPIErrorBudgetBurn` metric. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1982704[*BZ#1982704*])

[id="ocp-4-11-kube-scheduler-bug-fixes"]
==== Kubernetes Scheduler

* With {product-title} {product-version}, the hosted control plane namespace is excluded from eviction when the descheduler is installed on a cluster that has hosted control planes enabled. As a result, pods are no longer evicted from the hosted control plane namespace when the descheduler is installed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2000653[*BZ#2000653*])

* Previously, resources incorrectly specified the API version in the owner reference of the `kubedescheduler` custom resource (CR). Consequently, the owner reference was invalid, and the affected resources would not be deleted when the `kubedescheduler` CR ran. This update specifies the correct API version in all owner references. As a result, all resources with an owner reference to the `kubedescheduler` CR are deleted after the CR is deleted.

[id="ocp-4-11-machine-config-operator-bug-fixes"]
==== Machine Config Operator

* Because `keyFile` is not configured as the default plugin for NetworkManager on RHEL nodes, RHEL nodes might not reach the ready state after a reboot. With this fix, `keyFile` is set as the default NetworkManager plugin on all cluster nodes. As a result, nodes correctly reach the `ready` state after a reboot. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2060133[*BZ#2060133*])

* Because vSphere UPI clusters do not set the `PlatformStatus.VSphere` parameter at installation, the parameter was set to `nil`. This caused the MCO logs to be filled with unnecessary and repetitive messages that this parameter cannot have the value `nil`. This fix removes the warning, which was added to resolve a separate issue. As a result, the logs no longer list this message for vSphere UPI installations. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2080267[*BZ#2080267*])

* Previously, when you attempted to create a cluster with both FIPS and `realTimeKernel` the Machine Config Operator (MCO) degraded due to a merge logic issue within the code. With this update, the MCO no longer degrades when creating a cluster with both FIPS and `realTimeKernel`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2096496[*BZ#2096496*])

[id="ocp-4-11-compliance-operator-bug-fixes"]
==== Compliance Operator

* Previously, the Compliance Operator held references to machine configuration data, which significantly increased memory usage. Consequently, the Compliance Operator would fail with `CrashLoopBackoffs` because of out-of-memory exceptions. As a workaround, you should use an updated version of the Compliance Operator, for example. 0.1.53, which includes better handling of large machine configuration data sets in memory. As a result, the Compliance Operator continues to run when dealing with large machine configuration data sets. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2094854[*BZ#2094854*])

[id="ocp-4-11-monitoring-bug-fixes"]
==== Monitoring

* Before this update, dashboards in the {product-title} web console that contained queries using a container label for `container_fs*` metrics returned no data points because the container labels had been dropped due to high cardinality. This update resolves the issue, and these dashboards now display data as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2037513[*BZ#2037513*])

* Before this update, the `prometheus-operator` component allowed any time value for `ScrapeTimeout` in the config map. If you set `ScrapeTimeout` to a value greater than the `ScrapeInterval` value, Prometheus would stop loading the config map settings and fail to apply all subsequent configuration changes.
With this update, if the `ScrapeTimeout` value specified is greater than the `ScrapeInterval` value, the system logs the settings as invalid, but continues loading the other config map settings.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2037762[*BZ#2037762*])

* Before this update, in the *CPU Utilisation* panel on the *Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Cluster* dashboard in the {product-title} web console, the formula used to calculate the CPU utilization of a node could incorrectly display invalid negative values. With this update, the formula has been updated, and the *CPU Utilisation* panel now shows correct values. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2040635[*BZ#2040635*])

* Before this update, data from the `prometheus-adapter` component could not be accessed during the automatic update that occurs every 15 days because the update process removed old pods before the new pods became available. With this release, the automatic update process now only removes old pods after the new pods are able to serve requests so that data from the old pods continues to be available during the update process.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2048333[*BZ#2048333*])

* Before this update, the following metrics were incorrectly missing from `kube-state-metrics`: `kube_pod_container_status_terminated_reason`, `kube_pod_init_container_status_terminated_reason`, and `kube_pod_status_scheduled_time`. With this release, `kube-state-metrics` correctly displays these metrics so that they are available. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2050120[*BZ#2050120*])

* Before this update, if invalid write relabel config map settings existed for the `prometheus-operator` component, the configuration would still load all subsequent settings.
With this release, the component checks for valid write relabel settings when loading the configuration. If invalid settings exist, an error is logged, and the configuration loading process stops. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2051470[*BZ#2051470*])

* Before this update, the `init-config-reloader` container for the Prometheus pods requested `100m` of CPU and `50Mi` of memory, even though in practice the container needed fewer resources.
With this update, the container requests `1m` of CPU and `10Mi` of memory. These settings are consistent with the settings of the `config-reloader` container. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2057025[*BZ#2057025*])

* Before this update, when an administrator enabled user workload monitoring, the `user-workload-monitoring-config` config map was not automatically created. Because non-administrator users with the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role did not have permission to create the config map manually, they required an administrator to create it. With this update, the `user-workload-monitoring-config` config map is now automatically created when an administrator enables user workload monitoring and is available to edit by users with the appropriate role. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2065577[*BZ#2065577*])

* Before this update, after you deleted a deployment, the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) did not wait for the deletion to be completed, which caused reconciliation errors. With this update, the CMO now waits until deployments are deleted before recreating them, which resolves this issue. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2069068[*BZ#2069068*])

* Before this update, for user workload monitoring, if you configured external labels for metrics in Prometheus, the CMO did not correctly propagate these labels to Thanos Ruler. If you queried external metrics for user-defined projects, not provided by the user workload monitoring instance of Prometheus, you would sometimes not see external labels for these metrics even though you had configured Prometheus to add them. With this update, the CMO now properly propagates the external labels that you configured in Prometheus to Thanos Ruler, and you can see the labels when you query external metrics. Therefore, for user-defined projects, if you queried external metrics not provided by the user workload monitoring instance of Prometheus, you would sometimes not see external labels for these metrics even though you had configured Prometheus to add them. With this update, the CMO now properly propagates the external labels that you configured in Prometheus to Thanos Ruler, and you can see the labels when you query external metrics. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2073112[*BZ#2073112*])

* Before this update, the `tunbr` interface incorrectly triggered the `NodeNetworkInterfaceFlapping` alert. With this update, the `tunbr` interface is now included in the list of interfaces that the alert ignores and no longer causes the alert to trigger incorrectly. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2090838[*BZ#2090838*])

* Previously, the Prometheus Operator allowed invalid re-label configurations. With this update, the Prometheus Operator validates re-labeled configurations. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2051407[*BZ#2051407*])

[id="ocp-4-11-networking-bug-fixes"]
==== Networking

* Previously, when using the bond CNI plugin for an additional network attachment, it was not compatible with Multus. When the bond CNI plugin was used in conjunction with the Whereabouts IPAM plugin for a network attachment definition, assigned IP addresses were incorrectly reconciled. Now a network attachment definition that uses the bond CNI plugin works correctly with the Whereabouts IPAM plugin for IP address assignment. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2082360[*BZ#2082360*])

* Previously, when using the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network provider with multiple default gateways, the wrong gateway was selected, causing the OVN-Kubernetes pods to stop unexpectedly. Now the correct default gateway is selected such that these pods no longer fails. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2040933[*BZ#2040933*])

* For clusters using the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network provider, previously if the NetworkManager service restarted on a node, that node lost network connectivity. Now network connectivity survives a restart of the NetworkManager service. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2048352[*BZ#2048352*])

* Previously a `goroutine` handling cache updates could stall writing to an unbuffered channel while holding a `mutex`. With this update, these race conditions were solved. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2052398[*BZ#2052398*])

* Previously, for ovn-kubernetes, setting up `br-ex` on boot with a bond or team interface caused a mismatch on media access control (MAC) addresses between the `br-ex` and the bond interface. Consequently, on bare metal or some virtual platforms all of the traffic was dropped due to network interface controller (NIC) driver dropping traffic due to an unexpected `br-ex` MAC address. With this update, `br-ex` and the bond interface use the same MAC address resulting in no dropped traffic. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2103080[*BZ#2103080*])

* Previously, users with `cluster-reader` role could not read custom resources from kubernetes-nmstate, such as `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy`. With this update, users with `cluster-reader` role can read kubernetes-nmstate custom resources. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2022745[*BZ#2022745*])

* Previously, contrack entries for `LoadBalancer` IPs were not removed when the service endpoints were removed causing connections to fail. With this update, contrack entries do not cause connections to fail. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2061002[*BZ#2061002*])

* Previously, a missing `jq package` caused the scale up of a cluster with RHEL nodes to fail on node deployment. With this update,` jq package` is installed on deployment and the scale up of a cluster with RHEL nodes succeeds. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2052393[*BZ#2052393*])

* Previously, OVN-Kubernetes spent excessive time when a service configuration change was made. This caused a noticeable latency in service configuration changes. With this update, OVN-Kubernetes is optimized to reduce the latency of service configuration changes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2070674[*BZ#2070674*])

* Previously, the IP reconciliation CronJob for Whereabouts IPAM CNI would fail due to API connectivity issues, which caused CronJob to intermittently fail. With this update, CronJob launched on Whereabouts IPAM CNI use the api-internal server address and an extended api timeout to prevent these connectivity issues. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2048575[*BZ#2048575*])

* With this update, {product-title} clusters with Kubernetes-NMstate installed now include in the` must-gathers` Kubernetes-NMstate resources. This improves issue handling by including resources from Kubernetes-NMstate in `must-gathers`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2062355[*BZ#2062355*])

* There is currently a known issue with host routes being ignored when load-balancer services are configured with cluster traffic policy. Consequently, egress traffic of load balancer services is steered to the default gateway and not towards the best matching route that is present on the host routing table. As a workaround, set the load balancer type Services to `Local` traffic policy. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2060159[*BZ#2060159*])

* Previously, `PodDisruptionBudget` specifications did not fit for {SNO} clusters, which limited upgrade capabilities due to not all pods being able to be evicted. With this update, `PodDisruptionBudget` specification is adjusted based on cluster topology making Kubernetes-NMState operator capable of upgrading on {SNO} clusters. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2075491[*BZ#2075491*])

* Previously, when setting up `br-ex` bridge on boot, the DHCP client id and IPv6 address generation mode configuration did not work properly causing an unexpected IP address on `br-ex`. With this update, DHCP client id and IPv6 generation mode configuration are now properly set on `br-ex`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2058030[*BZ#2058030*])

* Previously, `egress-router-cni` pods lacked some cluster internal routes due to the reliance on the `gateway` field of the CNI definition to delete the default route and inject its own. With this update, `egress-router-cni` pods inject the correct routing information so that pods reach external and internal cluster destinations. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2075475[*BZ#2075475*])

* Previously, a pod disruption budget was used to create an OVN raft quorum on {SNO}. This raised an unhelpful `PodDisruptionBudgetAtLimit` alert on {SNO} clusters. With this update, the `PodDisruptionBudgetAtLimit` alert is no longer raised on these clusters. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2037721[*BZ#2037721*])

* Previously, a race condition in the `NetworkManager` restart sometimes prevented DHCP resolution to successfully complete setting up the `br-ex` bridge on node boot when using OVN-Kubernetes. With this update, `NetworkManager` is no longer restarted when setting up `br-ex`, eliminating the race condition. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2055433[*BZ#2055433*])

* Previously, the `PtpConfigSlave` source custom resource (CR) was set to the unsupported network transport UDPv4, causing errors on Distributed Unit (DU) nodes. This fix updates the `PtpConfigSlave` source CR to use network transport L2 rather than UDPv4. As a result, errors are no longer found on the DU nodes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2060492#[*BZ#2060492*])

* Previously, all {product-title} policies logging configurations were updated when a network policy was updated. This caused a noticeable latency on some concurrent or later network policies. With this update, all network policies are no longer updated when adding a new policy, eliminating latency. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2089392[*BZ#2089392*])

[id="ocp-4-11-ne-perf-improvements"]
==== Networking performance improvements

* Previously, a `systemd` service set a default Recieve Packet Steering (RPS) mask according to the reserved CPUs list in the performance profile for all network devices visible from udev excluding virtual devices. A `crio` hook script set the RPS mask of all network devices visible from `/sys/devices` for guaranteed pods. This resulted in multiple impacts to network performance. In this update, the `systemd` service only sets the default RPS mask for virtual interfaces under `/sys/devices/virtual`. The `crio` hook script now also excludes physical devices. This configuration mitigates issues such as overloading of processes, lengthy polling intervals, and spikes in latency.(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2081852[*BZ#2081852*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-11-node-bug-fixes"]
==== Node

* Previously, the pod manager handled the registration and de-registration of pod secrets and config maps. Because of this, pod secrets would sometimes fail to be mounted within a pod. With this fix, the pod ID is included in the key that the kubelet uses to manage registered pods. As a result, secrets are properly mounted as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1999325[*BZ#1999325*])

* Because of a memory leak in the garbage collection process, pods might not be able to start on a node due to lack of memory. With this fix memory is no longer leaking in the garbage collection process and nodes should start as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2065749[*BZ#2065749*])

* Because of a change in the upstream Kubernetes, the kubelet was not running readiness probes on terminated pods. As a result, a load balancer or controller could react more slowly to a terminating pod, which might have resulted in errors. With this fix, readiness probes are again being performed on pod termination. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2089933[*BZ#2089933*])

* Because of a bug, the kubelet could incorrectly reject pods that have `OutOfCpu` errors, if the pods were rapidly scheduled after other pods were reported as complete in the API. With this fix, the kubelet now waits to report the phase of a pod as terminal in the API until all running containers have stopped and no new containers have been started. Short-lived pods may take slightly longer, approximately 1s, to report either success or failure after this change. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2022507[*BZ#2022507*])

* Because recent versions of the `prometheus-adapter` are sending additional pod metrics, the Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) recommender is producing a large number of unnecessary and repetitive messages. With this fix, the VPA recognizes and ignores the extra metrics. As a result, these messages are no longer being produced. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102947[*BZ#2102947*])

[id="ocp-4-11-openshift-cli-bug-fixes"]
==== OpenShift CLI (oc)

* Previously, `oc` catalog mirroring failed if an older, deprecated image version was used as the source. Now, the image manifest version is detected automatically and mirroring works successfully. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049133[*BZ#2049133*])

* Previously, it was hard to understand from the logs when fallback inspect occurred. The logs are now improved to make this more explicit. As a result, the output of `must-gather run` is much more clear. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2035717[*BZ#2035717*])

* Previously, if you ran `must-gather` with invalid arguments, it did not consistently report the error and instead might attempt to collect data even when that is not possible. Now if `must-gather` is called with invalid options, it provides useful error output. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1999891[*BZ#1999891*])

* Previously, if the `oc adm catalog mirror` command resulted in errors, it still continued and returned a `0` exit code. A `--continue-on-error` flag is now available that allows users to determine whether the command should continue if there are errors, or exit with a non-zero exit code. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2088483[*BZ#2088483*])

* With this update, a `--subresource` flag was added to the `oc adm policy who-can` command to check who can perform a specified action on a subresource. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1905850[*BZ#1905850*])

* Previously, users were unable to use tab completion for the `oc project` command. Now, hitting tab after `oc project` properly lists projects. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2080416[*BZ#2080416*])

* Previously, startup probes were not removed from debug pods, which could cause issues with the debug pods if the startup probe failed. The `--keep-startup` flag has been added, which is `false` by default, meaning that startup probes are removed by default from debug pods. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2056122[*BZ#2056122*])

* Previously, there was no timeout specified after invoking `oc debug node`, so users were never logged out of the cluster. A `TMOUT` environment variable has been added, so that after the specified time of inactivity, the session is automatically terminated. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2043314[*BZ#2043314*])

* With this update, `oc login` now shows the URL for the web console even when users are logged out. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1957668[*BZ#1957668*])

* Previously, the `oc rsync` command displayed a wrong error output when the container was not found. With this release, the `oc rsync` command displays the correct error message when the specific container is not running. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2057633[*BZ#2057633*])

* Previously, large images could not be pruned if they were new to the cluster. This caused recent images to be omitted when filtering the over sized images. With this release, you can now prune images that exceed the given size. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2083999[*BZ#2083999*])

* Previously, there was a typo in the `gather` script. As a result, insights data was not collected properly. With this release, the typo is corrected and Insights data is now properly collected through the `must-gather`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2106543[*BZ#2106543*])

* Previously, you could not apply the `EgressNetworkPolicy` resource type in your cluster through the `oc` CLI. With this release, you can now create, update, and delete an `EgressNetworkPolicy` resource. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2071614[*BZ#2071614*])

[id="ocp-4-11-Kubernetes-controller-manage-bug-fixes"]
==== Kubernetes Controller Manager

* Previously, the beta feature for tracking jobs using pod finalizers was enabled by default. In some cases, pods were not always removed because the finalizers on them were not removed. With this update, the feature gate `JobTrackingWithFinalizers` is disabled by default. As a result, no pods should be left behind during removal. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2075621[*BZ#2075621*])

* Previously, a `PodDisruptionBudgetAtLimit` alert would occur whenever the CR replica count was zero. With this update, the alert will no longer fire if there is no application to disrupt or when the replica count is zero. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2053622[*BZ#2053622*])

[id="ocp-4-11-olm-bug-fixes"]
==== Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

* Before this update, invalid subscription labels were created when a resource name exceeded 63 characters. Truncating labels that exceed the 63-character limit resolves the issue, and the subscription resource no longer rejects the Kubernetes API. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2016425[*BZ#2016425*])

* Before this update, catalog source pods for the Marketplace Operator prevented nodes from draining. As a result, the Cluster Autoscaler could not scale down effectively. With this update, adding the `cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict` annotation to the catalog source pods fixes the issue, and the Cluster Autoscaler can scale down effectively. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2053343[*BZ#2053343*])

* Before this update, the `collect-profiles` job could take a long time to complete in certain circumstances, such as when a pod could not be scheduled. As a result, if enough jobs were scheduled but unable to run, the number of scheduled jobs exceeded pod quota limits. With this update, only one `collect-profiles` pod exists at a time, and the `collect-profiles` job does not exceed pod quota limits. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2055861[*BZ#2055861*])

* Before this update, the package server was not aware of pod topology when defining its leader election duration, renewal deadline, and retry periods. As a result, the package server strained topologies with limited resources, such as single-node environments. This update introduces a `leaderElection` package that sets reasonable lease duration, renewal deadlines, and retry periods. This fix reduces strain on clusters with limited resources.

* Previously, there was a bad catalog source in the `openshift-marketplace` namespace. Because of this, all subscriptions were blocked. With this update, if there is a bad catalog source in the `openshift-marketplace` namespace, users can subscribe to an operator from a quality catalog source of their own namespace with the original annotation. As a result, if there is a bad catalog source in the local namespace, the user cannot subscribe to any operator in the namespace. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2076323[*BZ#2076323*])

* Previously, info-level logs were generated during `operator-marketplace` project polling, which caused log spam. This update uses the command line flag to reduce the log line to the debug level, and adds more control of the log levels for the user. As a result, this reduces log spam. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2057558[*BZ#2057558*])

* Previously, each component managed by the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) consisted of YAML files defined in the `/manifest` directory in the root of a repository for a project. When removing a YAML file from the `/manifest` directory, you needed to add the `release.openshift.io/delete: “true”` annotation, otherwise the CVO would not delete the resources from the cluster. This update reintroduces any resources that were removed from the `/manifest` directory and adds the `release.openshift.io/delete: “true”` annotation so that the CVO cleans up the resources. As a result, resources that are no longer required for the OLM component are removed from the cluster. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1975543[*BZ#1975543*])

* Previously, the `CheckRegistryServer` function used by gRPC catalog sources did not confirm the existence of the service account associated with the catalog source. This caused the existence of an unhealthy catalog source with no service account. With this update, the gRPC `CheckRegistryServer` function checks if the service account exists and recreates the service if it is not found. As a result, the OLM recreates service accounts owned by gRPC catalog sources if they do not exist. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2074612[*BZ#2074612*])

* Previously, in an error message that occurred when users ran `opm index prune` against a file-based catalog image, imprecise language made it unclear that this command does not support that catalog format. This update clarifies the error message so users understand that the command `opm index prune` only supports SQLite-based images. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2039135[*BZ#2039135*])

* Previously, there was a broken thread safety around the Operator API. Consequently, Operator resources were not properly deleted. With this update, Operator resources are correctly deleted. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2015023[*BZ#2015023*])

* Previously, pod failures were artificially extending the validity period of certificates causing them to incorrectly rotate. With this update, the certificate validity period is correctly determined and the certificates are correctly rotated. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2020484[*BZ#2020484*])

* In {product-title} {product-version} the default cluster-wide pod security admission policy is set to `baseline` for all namespaces and the default warning level is set to `restricted`. Before this update, Operator Lifecycle Manager displayed pod security admission warnings in the `operator-marketplace` namespace. With this fix, reducing the warning level to `baseline` resolves the issue. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2088541[*BZ#2088541*])

==== Operator SDK

* Before this update, the Operator SDK used upstream images rather than downstream supported images to scaffold Hybrid Helm-based Operators. With this update, the Operator SDK uses supported downstream images to scaffold Hybrid Helm-based Operators. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2039135[*BZ#2039135*])

* With {product-title} 4.11, Operator SDK allows for `arm64` Operator images to be built. As a result, Operator SDK now supports building Operator images that target `arm64`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2035899#[*BZ#2035899*])

* Previously, {product-tile} running Hybrid Helm Operators scaffolded with Operator SDK would use upstream images rather than supported downstream images. With this update, scaffolding a Hybrid Helm Operator uses downstream images. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2066615[*BZ#2066615*])

[id="ocp-4-11-openshift-api-server-bug-fixes"]
==== OpenShift API server

* Because multiple Authentication Operator controllers were synchronizing at the same time, the Authentication Operator was taking too long to react to changes to its configuration. This feature adds jitter to the regular synchronization periods so that the Authentication Operator controllers do not compete for resources. As a result, it now takes less time for the Authentication Operator to react to configuration changes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1958198[*BZ#1958198*])

* With {product-title} 4.11, authentication attempts from external identity providers are now logged to the audit logs. As a result, you can view successful, failed, and errored login attempts from external identity providers in the audit logs. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2086465[*BZ#2086465*])

[id="ocp-4-11-rhcos-bug-fixes"]
==== {op-system-first}

* Before this update, if a machine was booted through PXE and the `BOOTIF` argument was on the kernel command line, the machine would boot with DHCP enabled on only a single interface. With this update, the machine boots with DHCP enabled on all interfaces even if the `BOOTIF` argument is provided. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2032717[*BZ#2032717*])

* Previously, nodes that were provisioned from VMware OVA images did not delete the Ignition config after initial provisioning. Consequently, this created security issues when secrets are stored within the Ignition config. With this update, the Ignition config is now deleted from the VMware hypervisor after initial provisioning on new nodes and when upgrading from a previous {product-title} release on existing nodes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2082274[*BZ#2082274*])

* Previously, any arguments provided to the `toolbox` command were ignored when the command was first invoked. This fix updates the toolbox script to initiate the `podman container create` command followed by the `podman start` and `podman exec` commands. It also modifies the script to handle multiple arguments and whitespaces as an array. As a result, the arguments passed to the `toolbox` command are executed every time as expected.

[id="ocp-4-11-performance-addon-operator-bug-fixes"]
==== Performance Addon Operator

* Previously, the CNF cyclictest runner should have provided the `--mainaffinity` argument, which told the binary which thread it should run on, however the cyclictest runner was missing the `--mainaffinity` argument. This update adds the `--mainaffinity` argument to the cyclictest runner, so that it is properly passed to the `cyclitest` command. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2051540[*BZ#2051540*])

* Previously, the `oslat` container specs lacked the `cpu-quota.crio.io: "disable"` annotation, which resulted in high latency. Consequently, the `cpu-quay.crio.io:"disable"` annotation was missing from the pod definition during creation. With this update, the `cpu-quota.crio.io:"disable"` annotation is appended during pod creation and, as a result, appears in the `oslat` pod's `specification` field. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2061676[*BZ#2061676*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-11-routing-bug-fixes"]
==== Routing

* Previously, the Ingress Operator did not validate whether a Kubernetes service object in the OpenShift Ingress namespace was created or owned by the Ingress Controller it was trying to reconcile with. Therefore, the Ingress Operator would modify or remove Kubernetes services that had the same name and namespace, regardless of ownership, causing unexpected behavior. With this update, the Ingress Operator can now check the ownership of existing Kubernetes services before attempting to modify or remove services. If ownership does not match, the Ingress Operator shows an error and does not take any action. As a result, the Ingress Operator cannot cannot modify or delete a custom Kubernetes service with the same name as the OpenShift Ingress namespace that it wants to modify or remove. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2054200[*BZ#2054200*])

* Previously, {product-title} 4.8 added an API for customizing platform routes. This API includes status and spec fields in the cluster ingress configuration for reporting the current host names of customizable routes and the user's desired host names for these routes, respectively. The API also defined constraints for these values. These constraints were restrictive and excluded some valid potential host names. Consequently, the restrictive validation for the API prevented users from specifying custom host names that should have been permitted and prevented users from being able to install clusters with domains that should have been permitted. With this update, the constraints on host names were relaxed to allow all host names that are valid for routes and {product-title} allows users to use cluster domains with TLDs that contain decimal digits. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2039256[*BZ#2039256*])

* Previously, the Ingress Operator did not check whether Ingress Controllers configured with cluster `spec.domain` parameter matched the `spec.baseDomain` parameter. This caused the Operator to create DNS records and set `DNSManaged` conditions to `false`. With this fix, the Ingress Operator now checks whether the `spec.domain` parameter matches with the cluster `spec.baseDomain`. As a result, for custom Ingress Controllers, the Ingress Operator does not create DNS records and sets `DNSManaged` conditions to false. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2041616#[*BZ#2041616*])

* Previously, in {product-title} 4.10, the HAProxy must-gather function could take up to an hour to run. This can happen when routers in the terminating state delay the `oc cp` command. The delay lasts until the pod is terminated. With the new release, a 10 minute limit on the `oc op` command prevents longer delays. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2104701[*BZ#2104701*])

* Previously, the Ingress Operator did not clear the route status when Ingress Controllers were deleted, showing that the route was still in the operator after its deletion. This fix clears the route status when an Ingress Controller is deleted, resulting in the route being cleared in the operator after its deletion. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1944851#[*BZ#1944851*])

* Previously, the output for the `oc explain router.status.ingress.conditions` command explain route status showed `Currently only Ready` rather than `Admitted` due to incorrect wording in the Application Programming Interface (API). This fix corrects the wording in the API. As a result, the command output is correct. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2041133#[*BZ#2041133*])

* Previously, the Ingress Operator detected that the user modified an annotation that the Operator manages on the `LoadBalancer-type` service. Consequently, the Operator set the Ingress Cluster Operator's `Upgradeable` status condition to `False` to block upgrades, and the Ingress Operator erroneously set the `Upgradeable` status condition to `False`, blocking upgrades, if the service had no annotations. Now, the logic that checks the service's annotations correctly handles empty annotations, and the Ingress Operator no longer erroneously blocks upgrades. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2097555[*BZ#2097555*])

* Previously, the Ingress Operator removed a finalizer that the Operator added to `LoadBalancer-type` services from previous versions of {product-title}. With this update, the Ingress Operator no longer removes finalizers. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2069457[*BZ#2069457*])

* The Ingress Operator performs health checks against the ingress canary route. Before this update, `keepalive` daemons are enabled on the connection, which caused the Ingress Operator not to close the TCP Connection to the load balancer (LB) after the health check was completed. A new connection was created for the next health check instead of using the existing connection. Consequently, the connection built on the load balancer and creating too many connections on the load balancer. With this update, `keepalive` daemons are disabled when connecting to the canary route, and a new connection is made and closed each time the canary probe is run. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2037447[*BZ#2037447*])

* Previously, the Ingress Controller did not set the `allowPrivilegeEscalation` value to false in the router deployment, which caused the router pods to be selected into the incorrect Security Context Constraint (SCC) and created conflicts with custom SCCs. This fix sets the `allowPrivilegeEscalation` value to `true`, ensuring that router pods are selected into the correct SCC and avoid conflicts with custom SCCs. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2007246#[*BZ#2007246*])

* Previously, when the canary route was not admitted to an Ingress Controller, the Ingress Operator status condition did not show as `degraded`. Consequently, the canary route could have shown as `valid` when its status condition should show as `not admitted`. With this update, the Ingress Operator status more accurately reflects the status of the canary controller. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2021446#[*BZ#2021446*])

* Previously, the `openshift-router` process briefly ignored the `SIGTERM` shutdown signal. This caused containers to ignore a Kubernetes shutdown request, resulting in one hour shutdown times. With this update, the router now responds to `SIGTERM` signals. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2076297#[*BZ#2076297*])

* Previously, when an Ingress Controller for an admitted route was deleted or a sharding configuration was added, a false status of `admitted` was given. With this update, the Ingress Controller clears the status of an `unadmitted` route, avoiding the false status scenario. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1944851[*BZ#1944851*])

* Previously, {product-title} clusters installed using version 4.7 or earlier maintained a `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-internal` annotation value of `0.0.0.0/0`. Clusters that were installed using 4.8 or later have the annotation value `true`. AWS cloud-provider implementations that check for the annotation value `true` would return the wrong result if the value was `0.0.0.0/0`. As a result, cluster upgrades to 4.10 would not complete. With this update, the annotation value is normalized to `true` so that the cluster upgrades can complete. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2055470[*BZ#2055470*])

[id="ocp-4-11-scalability-and-performance-bug-fixes"]
==== Scalability and performance

* Before this update, SRO installed Node Feature Discovery (NFD) by default, regardless of whether NFD had already been installed. If NFD had been installed, this would cause the SRO deployment to fail. SRO no longer deploys NFD by default.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-11-storage-bug-fixes"]
==== Storage

* Previously, the Alibaba Container Storage Interface (CS) driver that shipped with {product-title} returned errors when a user created a persistent volume claim (PVC) smaller than 20 GiB. This was due to Alibaba Cloud only supporting volumes larger than 20 GiB. With this update, Alibaba CSI driver automatically increases all volume sizes to at least 20 GiB and smaller PVCs are now dynamically provisioned. This can result in increased costs. Administrators can use quota on PVC count for each namespace in restricted environments to limit costs. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2057495[*BZ#2057495*])

* In earlier versions, the Local Storage Operator (LSO) added an owner reference to the persistent volumes (PVs) it created, such that deletion of the node would also issue a delete request for the PV. This could result in the PV remaining in the `Terminating` state while still attached to a pod. LSO no longer creates that OwnerReference, which means cluster administrators must delete any unused PVs after a node is removed from the cluster. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2061447#[*BZ#2061447*]) For more information, see xref:../storage/persistent_storage/persistent-storage-local.adoc#persistent-storage-local[Persistent storage using local volumes].

* This fix ensures that read-only-many volumes are provisioned appropriately by GCP CSI Driver as read-only. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1968253#[*BZ#1968253*])

* {product-title} allows installation of vSphere CSI drivers shipped by either the upstream community or VMware. Although Red Hat does not support this driver, cluster administrators can still install and use it because it has more features than the vSphere CSI driver shipped by Red Hat. {product-title} can be upgraded to {product-version} with the upstream and VMware vSphere CSI driver, however, you will be warned about the presence of a third party CSI driver. For more information, see (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2089419[*BZ#2089419*]) and (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2052071[*BZ#2052071*]).

* With this update, the default credentials request for Amazon Web Services (AWS) is modified to allow mounting of encrypted volumes using customer managed keys from Key Managment Service (KMS). Administrators who created credentials requests in manual mode with the Cloud Creditial Operator (CCO) will need to apply those changes manually if they intend to mount encrypted volumes using customer managed keys on AWS. Other administrators should not be impacted by this change. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049872[*BZ#2049872*])

* Previously, after deleting an {product-title} cluster deployed on IBM Cloud, the back-end storage volumes were not deleted. This prevented the cluster resources from being completely removed. This fix adds support in the installation program and the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver, resulting in back-end volume deletion after a cluster is removed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2047732#[*BZ#2047732*])

[id="ocp-4-11-web-console-developer-perspective-bug-fixes"]
==== Web console (Developer perspective)

* Before this update, the *Git Import* form displayed an error message when an invalid devfile repository (older than devfile v2.2) is entered. With this update, the error message states that devfiles older than v2.2 are not supported. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2046435[*BZ#2046435*])

* Before this update, if the *ConsoleLink CR* (openshift-blog) was not available in the cluster, the blog link was undefined. Clicking on the blog link did not redirect to the OpenShift blog. With this update, a fall back link to https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift/whats-new is added even if the *ConsoleLink CR* (openshift-blog) is not present in the cluster. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2050637[*BZ#2050637*])

* Before this update, the API version for the kafka CR was updated. This version did not support the old version, so an empty *Bootstrap server* was displayed on *Create Event Source - KafkaSource* even if it was created. With this update, the updated APIs for the Kafka CR support the old versions and renders the *Bootstrap server* list in *Create Event Source - KafkaSource* form. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2058623[*BZ#2058623*])

* Before this update, when you used the *Import from Git* form to import a private Git repository, the correct import type and a builder image were not identified because the secret to fetch the private repository details was not decoded. With this update, the *Import from Git* form decodes the secret to fetch the private repository details. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2053501[*BZ#2053501*])

* Before this update, from the developer perspective, the *Observe* dashboard opened for the most recently viewed workload rather than the one you selected in the *Topology* view. This issue happens because the session prefers the redux store instead of the query parameters in the URL. With this update, the *Observe* dashboard renders components based on the query parameters in the URL. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2052953[*BZ#2052953*])

* Before this update, the *Pipeline* used to start with the hardcoded value `gp2` as the default storage class even if it did not exist on the cluster. With this update, you can use the default specified storage class name instead of a hardcoded value. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2084635[*BZ#2084635*])

* Before this update, while running high-volume pipeline logs, the auto-scroll functionality does not work and logs display older messages. Running high-volume pipeline logs generates a large number of calls to the `scrollIntoView` method. With this update, high-volume pipeline logs do not generate any calls to the `scrollIntoView` method and gives a smooth auto-scroll functionality. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2014161[*BZ#2014161*])

* Before this update, when creating a *RoleBinding* using the *Create RoleBinding* form, the subject name was mandatory. A missing subject name fails to load the *Project Access* tab. With this update, the *RoleBinding* without the *Subject Name* property is not listed in the *Project Access* tab. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2051558[*BZ#2051558*])

* Before this update, the sink and trigger for event sources showed all the resources, even though those are standalone or part of backing the `k-native service`, `Broker`, or `KameletBinding`. The addressed resources used to show in the sink dropdown list. With this update, a filter has been added to show only standalone resources as sink. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2054285[*BZ#2054285*])

* Before this update, the empty tabs in the sidebar of the topology view were not filtered out before rendering. This displayed invalid tabs for *Workloads* in the topology view. With this update, the empty tabs are filtered properly before rendering. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049483[*BZ#2049483*])

* Before this update, when a pipeline is started using the *Start Last Run* button, the `started-by` annotation of the created `PipelineRun` was not updated to the correct username so the triggered by section did not show the correct username. With this update, the `started-by` annotation value is updated to the correct username and the triggered by section shows the username of the correct user that started the pipeline. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2046618[*BZ#2046618*])

* Before this update, the `ProjectHelmChartRepository` CR does not show up in the cluster. Consequently, the API schema for this CR has not been initialized in the cluster yet. With this update the `ProjectHelmChartRepository` shows up in the cluster. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2054197[*BZ#2054197*])

* Before this update, when you navigate using a keyboard in the topology, the selected items were not highlighted. With this update, navigation using a keyboard highlights and updates styles to the selected items. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2039277[*BZ#2039277*])

* Before this update, the layout of the web terminal opened outside of the default view and could not be resized. With this update, the web terminal opens inside the default view and resizes properly. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2022253[*BZ#2022253*])

* Before this update, some of the sidebar items did not contain namespace context. Consequently, when links were opened from another browser, or opening links from a different active namespace, the web console does not switch to the correct namespace. With this update, the correct namespace is selected when opening the URL. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2039647[*BZ#2039647*])

* Previously, when using the console to instantiate a template, its parameters were stored as a secret resource. When the template was removed, the secret remained. This consequently created an unnecessary build up of secrets in a cluster. With this update, an ownership reference is added to the secret that maps to the template instance. Now, when the template instance is removed, the secret is also removed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2015042[*BZ#2015042*])

* With this update, the `jsonData` property has been deprecated and replaced with `data` in the `ping` source. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2084438[*BZ#2084438*])

* Previously, the topology view in the {product-title} web console would fail or lag for clusters with more than 100 nodes. With this update, the topology view shows a `LimitExceeded` state for clusters with more than 100 nodes. An option is provided to view the resources by using the *Search* page instead. Alternatively, you can click *Show topology anyway* to continue to load the topology view. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2060329[*BZ#2060329*])

* Previously, if a service exposed multiple service ports and the route target port was `8080`, attempts to change the target port would result in another service port being updated instead of the port `8080` service port. With this update, the service port corresponding to the active target port is replaced when a new target port is set. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2077943[*BZ#2077943*])

* Previously, the `git` detection used to manage instance APIs to get repository information did not work for repositories from self hosted GitHub and Bitbucket. With this update, detection for self hosted GitHub and Bitbucket instance repositories works. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2038244[*BZ#2038244*])

* Previously, `apiVersion` was not passed in the correct format to the *Resource* drop-down menu in the *EventSource* creation form. This caused `InContext` to not be selected under *EventSource* creation, which excluded it from the *Resource* drop-down menu. With this update, the *Resource* drop-down menu includes `Resource` from `InContext`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2070020[*BZ#2070020*])

* Previously, the *Pipeline metrics* page displayed all API calls for the metrics query and failed with a `404` error. With this update, the `prometheus-tenancy` API is used to get the metrics data for the pipeline. Now, the pipeline metrics page displays all data and graphs to the non-admin user with at least view access to the namespace. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2041769[*BZ#2041769*])

* Previously, you could access a quick search and add modal with the Crtl+space keyboard shortcut, but you could not close them by using the same keyboard shortcut. With this update, you can close the quick search and add modal using the Ctrl+space keyboard shortcut. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2093586[*BZ#2093586*])

* Previously,  the resources created for user settings were not removed if the user was deleted. Consequently, the created resources in the `openshift-console-user-settings` namespace was never removed. With this update, an `ownerReference` is added to your metadata at creation. This allows automatic removal of the resources when the user no longer exists. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2019564[*BZ#2019564*])

== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.8 and beyond! This needs some SME/QE review before being updated for 4.11. Need to check if KI should be removed or should stay.
* In {product-title} 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.
+
If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.1 to {product-version}, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. Unless there is a specific need for unauthenticated access, you should revoke it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP `403` errors if you revoke unauthenticated access.
====
+
Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:
+
[source,bash]
----
## Snippet to remove unauthenticated group from all the cluster role bindings
$ for clusterrolebinding in cluster-status-binding discovery system:basic-user system:discovery system:openshift:discovery ;
do
### Find the index of unauthenticated group in list of subjects
index=$(oc get clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} -o json | jq 'select(.subjects!=null) | .subjects | map(.name=="system:unauthenticated") | index(true)');
### Remove the element at index from subjects array
oc patch clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} --type=json --patch "[{'op': 'remove','path': '/subjects/$index'}]";
done
----
+
This script removes unauthenticated subjects from the following cluster role bindings:
+
--
** `cluster-status-binding`
** `discovery`
** `system:basic-user`
** `system:discovery`
** `system:openshift:discovery`
--
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821771[*BZ#1821771*])

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.9 and beyond!
* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])

* In the monitoring stack, if you have enabled and deployed a dedicated Alertmanager instance for user-defined alerts, you cannot silence alerts in the *Developer* perspective in the {product-title} web console. This issue has been fixed in 4.11.8. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2100860[*BZ#2100860*])

* On a newly installed {product-title} {product-version} cluster, platform monitoring alerts do not have the `openshift_io_alert_source="platform"` label. This issue does not affect clusters upgraded from a previous minor version. There is currently no workaround exists for this issue. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2103127[*BZ#2103127*])

* In the {rh-openstack-first}, a potential issue can affect Kuryr when the ports pools are populated with a variety of bulk port creation requests made at the same time. During these bulk requests, if the IP allocation for one of the IP addresses fails, the Neutron retries the operation for all ports. This issue was resolved in a previous errata; however, you can set a small value for the ports pools batch to avoid large bulk port creation requests. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2024690[*BZ#2024690*])

* The oc-mirror CLI plugin cannot mirror {product-title} catalogs earlier than version 4.9. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2097210[*BZ#2097210*])

* The oc-mirror CLI plugin can fail to upload an image set to the target mirror registry if the `archiveSize` value in the image set configuration is smaller than the container image size, causing the catalog directory to span multiple archives. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2106461[*BZ#2106461*])

* In {product-title} 4.11, the MetalLB Operator scope has changed from namespace to cluster and this results in upgrading from a prior version failing.
+
As a workaround, remove the previous version of the MetalLB Operator. Do not delete the namespace or the instance of the MetalLB custom resource, and deploy the new Operator version. This keeps MetalLB running and configured.
+
For more information, see xref:../networking/metallb/metallb-upgrading-operator.adoc#metallb-upgrading-operator[Upgrading the MetalLB Operator]. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2100180[*BZ#2100180*])

* Deleting the bidirectional forwarding detection (BFD) profile and removing the `bfdProfile` added to the border gateway protocol (BGP) peer resource does not disable the BFD. Instead, the BGP peer starts using the default BFD profile. To disable BFD from a BGP peer resource, delete the BGP peer configuration and recreate it without a BFD profile. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2050824[*BZ#2050824*])

* The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) for {product-title} 4.11 does not work properly on macOS due to a change in error handling of untrusted certificates in Go 1.18 libraries. Due to this change, `oc login` and other `oc` commands can fail with a `certificate is not trusted` error without proceeding further when running on macOS. Until the error handling is properly fixed in Go 1.18 (tracked by link:https://github.com/golang/go/issues/52010[Go issue #52010]), the workaround is to use the {product-title} 4.10 `oc` CLI instead. Note that when using the {product-title} 4.10 `oc` CLI with an {product-title} 4.11 cluster, it is no longer possible to get a token by using the `oc serviceaccounts get-token <service_account>` command. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2097830[*BZ#2097830*]) (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2109799[*BZ#2109799*])

* There is currently a known issue in the *Add Helm Chart Repositories* form to extend the Developer Catalog of a project. The *Quick Start* guides shows that you can add the `ProjectHelmChartRepository` CR in the desired namespace whereas it does not mention that to perform this you need permission from the kubeadmin. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2054197[*BZ#2054197*])

* There is currently a known issue. If you create an instance of `ProjectHelmChartRepository` custom resource (CR) that uses TLS verification, you cannot list the repositories and perform Helm-related operations. There is currently no workaround for this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/HELM-343[*HELM-343*])

* If the pruner fails, the Image Registry Operator is degraded until the pruner successfully runs. By default, the pruner runs once a day. As a workaround, you can give it more opportunities to run successfully by configuring it to run more often. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1990125[*BZ#1990125*])

* When running {product-title} on bare-metal IBM Power, there is a known issue that the Petitboot bootloader is unable to populate boot configurations for some {op-system} live images. In such cases, after booting nodes with PXE to install {op-system}, the expected live image disk configuration might not be visible.
+
As a workaround, you can boot manually with `kexec` from the Petitboot shell.
+
Identify the disk that holds the live image, in this example `nvme0n1p3`, and run the following commands:
+
[source,bash]
----
# cd /var/petitboot/mnt/dev/nvme0n1p3/ostree/rhcos-*/
# kexec -l vmlinuz-*.ppc64le -i initramfs-*.img -c "ignition.firstboot rd.neednet=1 ip=dhcp $(grep options /var/petitboot/mnt/dev/nvme0n1p3/loader/entries/ostree-1-rhcos.conf | sed 's,^options ,,')" && kexec -e
----
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2107674[*BZ#2107674*])

* In a disconnected environment, SRO does not try to fetch DTK from the main registry. It fetches from the mirror registry instead. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102724[*BZ#2102724*])

* The process counter displays incorrect information for the `phc2sys` process on the interface where `phc2sys` is not running. There is currently no workaround for this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-46005[*OCPBUGSM-46005*])

* When a network interface controller (NIC) in a node with a dual NIC PTP configuration is shut down, a faulty event is generated for both PTP interfaces. There is currently no workaround for this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-46004[*OCPBUGSM-46004*])

* In low-band systems, the system clock does not synchronize with the PTP ordinary clock after the grandmaster clock is disconnected for a few hours and recovered. There is currently no workaround for this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-45173[*OCPBUGSM-45173*])

* Previously, if you were using the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network provider, if a service with `type=LoadBalancer` was configured with `internalTrafficPolicy=cluster` set, then all traffic was routed to the default gateway, even if the host routing table included better routes to use. Now the best route is used rather than always using the default gateway. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2060159[*BZ#2060159*])

* When an OVN cluster has more than 75 worker nodes, simultaneously creating 2000 or more services and route objects can cause pods created at the same time to hang in the `ContainerCreating` status. If this problem occurs, entering the `oc describe pod <podname>` command will show events with the following warning: `FailedCreatePodSandBox...failed to configure pod interface: timed out waiting for OVS port binding (ovn-installed)'. There is currently no workaround for this issue.  (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2084062[*BZ#2084062*])

* There is currently a known issue with OVN-Kubernetes that whenever the `NetworkManager` service restarts the node will lose network connectivity and must be recovered. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2074009[*BZ#2074009*])

* The default security context constraint (SCC) might cause a pod using generic ephemeral volumes to remain in the `Pending` state. To work around this issue, you can create a custom SCC. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6967807[*Pods with Generic Ephemeral Volumes fail with SCC errors*]. For the workaround, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6967808[*Allowing the use of generic ephemeral volumes*]. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2100429[*BZ#2100429*])

* If you have {sandboxed-containers-first}, when upgrading a cluster, you might encounter an issue where the Machine Config Operator (MCO) pod changes to a `CrashLoopBackOff` state and the `openshift.io/scc` annotation of the pod displays `sandboxed-containers-operator-scc` instead of the default `hostmount-anyuid` value.
+
If this happens, temporarily change the `seLinuxOptions` strategy in the `sandboxed-containers-operator-scc` SCC to the less restrictive `RunAsAny`, so that the admission process does not prefer it over the `hostmount-anyuid` SCC.
+
--
. Change the `seLinuxOptions` strategy by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch scc sandboxed-containers-operator-scc --type=merge --patch '{"seLinuxContext":{"type": "RunAsAny"}}'
----

. Restart the MCO pod by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale deployments/machine-config-operator -n openshift-machine-config-operator --replicas=0
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale deployments/machine-config-operator -n openshift-machine-config-operator --replicas=1
----

. Revert the `seLinuxOptions` strategy of the `sandboxed-containers-operator-scc` to its original value of `MustRunAs` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch scc sandboxed-containers-operator-scc --type=merge --patch '{"seLinuxContext":{"type": "MustRunAs"}}'
----

. Verify that the `hostmount-anyuid` SCC is applied to the MCO pod by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-machine-config-operator -l k8s-app=machine-config-operator -o yaml | grep scc
openshift.io/scc: hostmount-anyuid
----

(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KATA-1373[*KATA-1373*])

* The pipeline metrics API does not support the required `pipelinerun/taskrun` histogram values from {rh-openstack} 1.6 and beyond. Consequently, the *Metrics* tab in the *Pipeline* -> *Details* page is removed instead of displaying incorrect values. There is currently no workaround for this issue. (link: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2074767[*BZ#2074767*])

* Some Alibabacloud services are not placing all resources of a cluster into a specified resource group. Consequently, some resources created by the {product-title} installation program are placed in the default resource group. There is currently no workaround for this issue. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2096692[*BZ#2096692*])

* After rebooting each cluster node, cluster Operators `network` and `kube-apiserver` turns to `degraded` after rebooting each node of the cluster and the cluster turns unhealthy. There is currently no workaround for this issue. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102011[*BZ#2102011*])

* When `resourceGroupID` is specified in `install-config.yaml`, an error is displayed when deleting bootstrap resources and {product-title} installation fails. As a workaround for this issue, do not specify `resourceGroupID` in `install-config.yaml`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2100746[*BZ#2100746*])

* There is a known issue with scale-up on RHEL compute nodes. The new nodes could turn into `Ready`, but Ingress pods cannot turn into `Running` on these nodes, and scale-up does not succeed. As a workaround, scale-up with {op-system} nodes does work. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2056387[*BZ#2056387*])

* After creating a `machineset` in a Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the `capg-controller-manager` machine is stuck in `Provisioning`. There is currently no workaround for this issue. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2107999[*BZ#2107999*])

* There is a known issue on Nutanix where persistent volumes (PVs) created by a cluster are not cleaned up by the  `destroy cluster` command. As a workaround for this issue, you need to clean up the PVs manually. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2108700[*BZ#2108700*])

* There is a known issue with Nutanix installation where the installation fails if you use 4096-bit certificates with Prism Central 2022.x. Instead, use 2048-bit certificates. (link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6976743[*KCS*])

* There is currently a known issue when creating and editing `egressqos` with incorrect syntax or values success. The incorrect values in `egressqos` should not create successfully. There is currently no workaround for this issue.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2097579[*BZ#2097579*])

* Due to the inclusion of old images in some image indexes, running `oc adm catalog mirror` and `oc image mirror` might result in the following error: `error: unable to retrieve source image`. As a temporary workaround, you can use the `--skip-missing` option to bypass the error and continue downloading the image index. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6975305[Service Mesh Operator mirroring failed].

* It is not possible to create a macvlan on the physical function (PF) when a virtual function (VF) already exists. This issue affects the Intel E810 NIC. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2120585[*BZ#2120585*])

==== Bug fixes

* Previously, an update of the `routeSelector` cleared the route status of the Ingress Controller prior to the router deployment. As a result, the route status repopulated incorrectly.

==== {product-title} 4.11 RAN new features

[id="ocp-4-11-talm-upgrade-recovery"]
=====  Recovering clusters after a failed update

For {sno}, you can use the {cgu-operator-first} Operator to create a backup of a current deployment before an {product-title} version update. If the update fails, use the backup to return the cluster to its pre-update state.
For more information, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/cnf-talm-for-cluster-upgrades.html#talo-backup-feature-concept_cnf-topology-aware-lifecycle-manager[Creating a backup of cluster resources before upgrade].

[id="ocp-4-11-RAN-disabling-chronyd"]
=====  Disable chronyd in the `PolicyGenTemplate` custom resource (CR)

You must disable `chronyd` if you update to {product-title} 4.11 from earlier versions. To disable `chronyd`, add the following line in the `[service]` section under `.spec.profile.data` of the `TunedPerformancePatch.yaml` file. The `TunedPerformancePatch.yaml` file is referenced in the group `PolicyGenTemplate` CR:

[source,yaml]
----
[service]
service.chronyd=stop,disable
----

For more information, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-vdu-validating-cluster-tuning.adoc#recommended-cluster-kernel-configuration[Recommended cluster kernel configuration].

[id="ocp-4-11-ran-known-issues"]
==== {product-title} 4.11 RAN known issues

* After deploying a {sno} cluster with the RAN DU profile, an error `openvswitch: cpu_id mismatch with handler threads` is continuously generated in the Open vSwitch kernel logs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-46165[*OCPBUGSM-46165*])

* If secure boot is currently disabled and you try to enable it using ZTP, the cluster installation does not start. When secure boot is enabled through ZTP, the boot options are configured before the virtual CD is attached. Therefore, the first boot from the existing hard disk has the secure boot turned on. The cluster installation gets stuck because the system never boots from the CD. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-45085[*OCPBUGSM-45085*])

* If an invalid subscription channel is specified in the subscription policy that is used to perform a cluster upgrade, the {cgu-operator-full} indicates a successful upgrade right after the policy is enforced because the `Subscription` state remains `AtLatestKnown`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-43618[*OCPBUGSM-43618*])

* If the SRIOV-FEC Operator is installed through separate policies and the `CatalogSource` reuses the name of a default catalog source, the Operator installation might fail due to conflicts with the management of the default catalog sources. To avoid this issue, the SRIOV-FEC `CatalogSource` CR should be added to the `common-config-policy` and the Operator subscription should be added to the `common-subscriptions-policy`. As a workaround when using separate policies to install the SRIOV-FEC Operator, you must ensure that the `CatalogSource` for this Operator is uniquely named. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-39859[*OCPBUGSM-39859*])

* The `SiteConfig` disk partition definition fails when applied to multiple nodes in a cluster. When a `SiteConfig` CR is used to provision a compact cluster, creating a valid `diskPartition` config on multiple nodes fails with a Kustomize plugin error. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-44403[*OCPBUGSM-44403*])

* When you patch the `ArgoCD` resource with the ZTP container, the patch points to a tag which follows the latest container version for that release version. If you want to pin the ZTP container to a specific version within the release, the patch file `argocd-openshift-gitops-patch.json` should be updated to point to the specific version. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-44261[*OCPBUGSM-44261*])

*  Applying a `BMCEventSubscription` CR fails to create a Redfish events subscription. After the subscription YAML file is created and applied, no active Redfish subscription is visible. As a workaround, call the API directly and create the subscription. For example,

. Get the authentication token by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -i --insecure --request POST --header "OData-Version: 4.0" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"UserName": <BMC_USERNAME>, \
"Password": <BMC_PASSWORD>}' https://<BMC_IP>/redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions/ |grep 'X-Auth-Token'
----
+
.Example output

[source,terminal]
----
X-Auth-Token: 1234abcd5678efgh9012ijkl3456mnop
----

. Using the authentication token, create the Redfish events subscription:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -X POST -i --insecure --header "X-Auth-Token: 1234abcd5678efgh9012ijkl3456mnop" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{"Protocol": "Redfish", "Context": \
"Public", "Destination": "https://hw-event-proxy-openshift-hw-events.apps.example.com/webhook", \
"EventTypes": ["Alert"]}' https://<BMC_IP>/redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions
----

+
You should receive a `201 Created` response and a header with `Location: https://<BMC_IP>/redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions/35` that indicates that the Redfish events subscription is successfully created. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-43707[*OCPBUGSM-43707*])

* When using the GitOps ZTP pipeline to install a {sno} cluster in a disconnected environment, there should be two `CatalogSource` CRs applied in the cluster. One of the `CatalogSource` CRs gets deleted following multiple node reboots. As a workaround, you can change the default names, such as `certified-operators` and `redhat-operators`, of the catalog sources. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-46245[*OCPBUGSM-46245*])

* Several clusters fail to update during scale testing. After starting an {product-title} 4.9.26 update with the Telecom vDU configuration applied, a cluster update to 4.10.13 initiated with the `ClusterVersion` CR fails at 15% and waits for cluster Operators updating to the target version. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-44655[*OCPBUGSM-44655*])

* Sometimes, during ZTP GitOps pipeline {sno} installations, the Operator Lifecycle Manager registry-server container fails to reach the `READY` state. When creating subscriptions with a new `CatalogSource`, the `CatalogSource` remains in a `TRANSIENT_FAILURE` state. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-44041[*OCPBUGSM-44041*])

* When you apply a tuned override to a pod and delete the tuned pod to force a restart, the pod should restart and the system should run normally. Instead, a `systemd` hang can occur, causing the system to stop responding. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHELPLAN-131021[*RHELPLAN-131021*])

* When booting ZT Systems machines from a live ISO with static IPv6 address configuration, `NetworkManager` exits successfully before the interface link becomes ready. This leaves the network interface without a configuration. As a workaround, edit the RHCOS ISO referenced in the `AgentServiceConfig` CR to append `rd.net.timeout.carrier` to the kernel parameters in the `grub.cfg` file:

. Pull the `rhcos-live` ISO image for the release being installed. The URL can be retrieved from the `AgentServiceConfig` CR on the hub cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get AgentServiceConfig agent -o yaml
----

. Mount the image in the `/mnt/iso/` directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mount rhcos-live.x86_64.iso /mnt/iso/
----

. Create the `iso-grub-cfg/` directory and change to the directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir iso-grub-cfg/; pushd iso-grub-cfg/
----

. Copy the contents of the `/mnt/iso/` directory to your working directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rsync -avH /mnt/iso/* .
----

. Open the GRUB configuration file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ vim EFI/redhat/grub.cfg
----

.. Append the `rd.net.timeout.carrier=20` string to the `linux` boot line.

. Return to the initial working directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ popd
----

. Generate the ISO file from the `iso-grub-cfg` directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkisofs -JR -graft-points -o rhcos-carrier-timeout.iso iso-grub-cfg
----

. Push the updated ISO image to the server that is accessible by the hub cluster.

. On the hub cluster, update the `osImages` entry in the `AgentServiceConfig` CR for the installing release to point to the updated ISO image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit AgentServiceConfig agent
----

. Update the `url` field to point to the URL of the updated ISO image.

+
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-46336[*OCPBUGSM-46336*])

* A kernel failure occurs after rebooting a bare-metal SNO with DU profile and workload test application. As a workaround, you can add an additional kernel parameter to the performance profile:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
kind: PerformanceProfile
spec:
  additionalKernelArgs:
  - rcutree.kthread_prio=11
----
+
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHELPLAN-123262[*RHELPLAN-123262*])

* During ZTP cluster deployments, bare-metal host image provisioning might fail with an error referencing the HTTP 412 error code:
+
[source,terminal]
----
Deploy step deploy.deploy failed with HTTPError: HTTP PATCH https://10.16.230.34/redfish/v1/Managers/1/VirtualMedia/EXT1 returned code 412. Base.1.8.GeneralError: A general error has occurred. See ExtendedInfo for more information. Extended information: [

{'MessageSeverity': 'Critical', 'MessageArgs': [], 'MessageId': 'Base.1.8.PreconditionFailed', 'Resolution': 'Try the operation again using the appropriate ETag.', '@odata.type': '#Message.v1_1_0.Message', 'Message': 'The ETag supplied did not match the ETag required to change this resource.'}]
----

+
This issue might affect various server models, including Gen8 HP machines and Gen9 HP machines running older firmware. For Gen9 HP machines, upgrading to the latest iLO firmware might resolve the issue. For Gen8 HP and others machines, there is currently no workaround for this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1246[*OCPBUGS-1246*])

* On certain Lenovo models, for example the SE450, bare-metal host image provisioning during ZTP cluster deployments might fail with the HTTP 400 status code and a `PropertyNotWriteable` error:
+
[source,terminal]
----
HTTP response for PATCH https://192.168.26.178/redfish/v1/Systems/1/Pending: status code: 400, error: Base.1.8.GeneralError: A general error has occurred. See ExtendedInfo for more information., extended: [{'MessageArgs': ['BootSourceOverrideEnabled'], 'Resolution': 'Remove the property from the request body and resubmit the request if the operation failed.', MessageId': 'Base.1.8.PropertyNotWritable', 'Message': 'The property BootSourceOverrideEnabled is a read only property and cannot be assigned a value.', '@odata.type': '#Message.v1_1_0.Message', 'MessageSeverity': 'Warning'}]
----

+
Currently, there is no workaround for this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-46305[*OCPBUGSM-46305*])

* During a primary node replacement in a bare-metal cluster, the new primary host gets stuck in a `Provisioning` state, but the node reports into the cluster as `Ready`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-45772[*OCPBUGSM-45772*])

* Using {rh-rhacm-first}, spoke cluster deployments on Dell PowerEdge R640 servers are blocked when the virtual media does not disconnect the ISO in the iDRAC console after writing the image to the disk. As a workaround, disconnect the ISO manually through the Virtual Media tab in the iDRAC console. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-45884[*OCPBUGSM-45884*])

* On a dual-stack networking environment, devices and connections get stuck in an `ip-check` state with a default `dhcp6` profile generated by the `nm-initrd-generator` utility. Due to this issue, the `/etc/resolve.conf` file is not generated. As a workaround, restart the `NetworkManager` service. This generates the missing `/etc/resolve.conf` file and the installation can continue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHELPLAN-127788[*RHELPLAN-127788*], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-70[*OCPBUGS-70*])

* When using NVIDIA-branded Mellanox NICs on Dell hardware, incoming packets that are larger than the preset F5 application receive buffer (currently set to 8K) arrive with an incorrect VLAN tag. This results in irregular truncated packets being delivered by the NIC. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHELPLAN-123058[*RHELPLAN-123058*])

* Sometimes, a {sno} node configured with static IP and deployed using the GitOps ZTP pipeline becomes unreachable during Day 2 operator configuration. The {product-title} cluster installation completes successfully, and the cluster is healthy. After reboot, the node becomes unreachable with the network interface down. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-46688[*OCPBUGSM-46688*])

* After removing the `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` policy from the Git repository, the `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` resource managed by the removed policy remains on the spoke cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-34614[*OCPBUGSM-34614*])

* When upgrading the PTP Operator from 4.10 to 4.11, the OpenShift subscription reports the error no channel heads (entries not replaced by another entry) found in channel `"stable"` of package `"ptp-operator"`. However, the Operator upgrades successfully. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-46114[*OCPBUGSM-46114*])

* Currently, all `PtpConfig` CRs in the ZTP source CRs includes the `phc2sysOpts` option. Therefore, even if the user does not include `phc2sysOpts` in the user `PolicyGenTemplate` CR, the `phc2sysOpts` option is added to the spoke PTP configuration. If PTP with dual NIC is configured through ZTP, the user needs to update one `PtpConfig` CR to remove the `phc2sysOpts` option after ZTP is completed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-47798[*OCPBUGSM-47798*])

* When secure boot is enabled `stalld`, service fails to start because it is not able to open the `/sys/kernel/debug/sched_features` file. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1466[*OCPBUGSM-1466*])

* When secure boot is enabled, the `kdump` service might fail to start with `kexec: failed to load kdump kernel` error. To workaround this issue, add `efi=runtime`to the kernel arguments. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-97[*OCPBUGSM-97*])

* If an SNO cluster is upgraded from OCP 4.10 to OCP 4.11, the SNO cluster might  get rebooted three times during the upgrade process. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-46704[*OCPBUGSM-46704*])

* If a Supermicro server is deployed through ZTP, the incorrect boot device might be chosen preventing the install from starting. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-369[*OCPBUGSM-369*])

* The default `dns-default` pod is missing the `"target.workload.openshift.io/management:"` annotation. As a result, when the workload partitioning feature is enabled on SNO, the pod resources do not get mutated and pinned to the reserved CPU set. As a workaround, the cluster administrator can add the annotation manually using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate pod dns-default target.workload.openshift.io/management='{"effect":"PreferredDuringScheduling"}' -n openshift-dns
----

* Previously, if you used upper-case letters when specifying an Azure Disk Encryption Set (DES) or Resource Group (RG) name, the validation would fail. With this release, you can now use upper and lower case letters in DES and RG names. (link:https://issues.redhat.com//browse/OCPBUGS-4826[*OCPBUGS#4826*])

==== Enhancements

* IPv6 unsolicited neighbor advertisements and IPv4 gratuitous address resolution protocol now default on the SR-IOV CNI plugin. Pods created with the Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) CNI plugin, where the IP address management CNI plugin has assigned IPs, now send IPv6 unsolicited neighbor advertisements and/or IPv4 gratuitous address resolution protocol by default onto the network. This enhancement notifies hosts of the new pod's MAC address for a particular IP to refresh ARP/NDP caches with the correct information. For more information, see xref:../networking/hardware_networks/about-sriov.adoc#supported-devices_about-sriov[Supported devices].

* Previously named heterogeneous clusters are now refered to as multi-architecture in {product-title} documentation. For more information, see xref:../post_installation_configuration/multi-architecture-configuration.adoc[Configuring a multi-architecture cluster]

[id="ocp-4-11-18-bug-fixes"]
==== Bug fixes

* Previously, some object storage instances responded with `204 No Content` when no content displayed. The {rh-openstack-first} SDK used in {product-title} did not handle 204s correctly. With this update, the installation program works around the issue when there are zero items to list. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4081[*OCPBUGS-4081*])

* Previously, the rollout times for `kube-apiserver` on a loaded cluster were slow and sometimes exceeded the 5 min rollout timeout. With this update, the rollout times are shorter and within the 5 min threshold. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3182[*OCPBUGS-3182*])

==== Known issues

* Switching the router scope of the default Ingress Controller by setting the `spec.endpointPublishingStrategy.loadBalancer.scope` field results in a degraded Ingress Operator. Consequently, routes that use that endpoint such as the web console URL become inaccessible. As a workaround, restarting one of the router pods brings back several instances under the `loadbalancer` back to the `inService` status.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2554[*OCPBUGS-2554*])

[id="ocp-4-11-21-bug-fixes"]
==== Bug fixes

* Previously, after rotating {rh-openstack-first} credentials, the Cinder CSI driver continued to use old credentials until it was restarted out of band. If the old credentials were no longer valid, all volume operations failed. With this update, the Cinder CSI driver is updated automatically when the {rh-openstack} credentials are rotated. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4103[*OCPBUGS-4103*])

* Previously, in CoreDNS v1.7.1, all upstream cache refreshes used DNSSEC. Bufsize was hardcoded to 2048 bytes for the upstream query, causing some DNS upstream queries to break when there were UDP Payload limits within the networking infrastructure. With this update, {product-title} always uses bufsize 512 for upstream cache requests as that is the bufsize specified in the Corefile. Customers might be impacted if they rely on the incorrect functionality of bufsize 2048 for upstream DNS requests. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2901[*OCPBUGS-2901*])

* Previously, availability sets were created when `vmSize` was invalid in a region that has zones. However, availability sets should only be created in regions that do not have zones. With this update, the correct `vmSize` is provided and an availability set is no longer provided for a machine set.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2123[*OCPBUGS-2123*])

==== Bug fixes

* The {product-title} {product-version} release updates the `install-config.yaml` file to now list the `me-west1`, (Tel Aviv, Israel) region. After you install the {product-title} by running the `openshift-install` binary, you can select the `me-west1` region for your chosen cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4720[*OCPBUGS-4720*])

* Previously, some object storage instances responded with a `204 No Content` error message when content was supposed to display. The {rh-openstack-first} SDK used in {product-title} does not handle 204s correctly. With this update, the installation program works around the issue when there are zero objects to list in a Swift container. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5078[*OCPBUGS-5078*])

* Previously, the deployment of {product-title} 4.11.ec4 build failed with the latest RHCOS image `412.86.202210072120-0` and `rhel-86` image. As a result, the {op-system-first} node is stuck at booting. With this update, the deployment completes successfully. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2321[*OCPBUGS-2321*])

[id="ocp-4-11-22-known-issues"]
==== Known issues

* Any 4.11 and later  `arm64` cluster that has more than around 470 containers to a node, can cause additional pod creation to fail with the following error:
+
[source,terminal]
----
runc create failed: unable to start container process: unable to init seccomp: error loading seccomp filter into kernel: error loading seccomp filter: errno 524"
----
+
This is due to a CoreOS limitation in the number of seccomp profiles that can be created on the worker node. This most likely occurs on clusters with multiple containers per pod during an upgrade, worker node failure, or pod scaleup. This will be fixed in a later version of {product-title}.
