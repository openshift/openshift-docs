Use the new `tuning-cni` meta plug-in to set an interface level safe network sysctls that only applies to a specific interface. For example, you can change the behavior of `accept_redirects` on a particular network interface by configuring the `tuning-cni` plug-in. A complete list of the interface-specific safe sysclts that can be set is available in the documentation.

In addition to this enhancement the set of system-wide safe sysctls that can be set has increased to support `net.ipv4.ping_group_range` and `net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start`.

For more information about configuring the `tuning-cni` plugin, see xref:../networking/setting-interface-level-network-sysctls.adoc#nodes-setting-interface-level-network-sysctls[Setting interface level network sysctls].

For more information about the newly supported interface level network safe sysclts and updates to the list of supported system-wide safe sysclts, see xref:../nodes/containers/nodes-containers-sysctls.adoc#nodes-containers-sysctls[Using sysctls in containers].

[id="ocp-4-11-coredns-forwarding-DNS-requests-over-TLS"]
==== Support for CoreDNS forwarding DNS requests over TLS

When working in a highly regulated environment, you might need the ability to secure domain name system (DNS) traffic when forwarding requests to upstream resolvers so that you can ensure additional DNS traffic and data privacy. Cluster administrators can now configure transport layer security (TLS) for forwarded DNS queries. This feature applies only to the DNS Operator and not the CoreDNS instance managed by the Machine Config Operator.

For more information, see xref:../networking/dns-operator.adoc#nw-dns-forward_dns-operator[Using DNS forwarding].

[id="ocp-4-11-ovn-internal-traffic-policy-support"]
==== Internal traffic support for OVN-Kubernetes

As a cluster administrator, you can configure `internalTrafficPolicy=Local` on a Kubernetes service object when using the OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) cluster network provider. This feature allows cluster administrators to route traffic to an endpoint on the same node that the traffic originated from. If there are no local node endpoints, traffic will be dropped.

For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service-traffic-policy[Service Internal Traffic Policy].

[id="ocp-4-11-alb-operator-support"]
==== Support for AWS Load Balancer Operator (Technology Preview)

As a cluster administrator, you can install the AWS Load Balancer Operator from the OperatorHub by using the {product-title} web console or CLI. The AWS Load Balancer Operator is in Technology Preview.

[id="ocp-4-11-routes-spec-subdomain-field"]
==== Enhancement to the Route API

Previously, you could not specify the subdomain of a route, and the `spec.host` field was required to set the host name. You can now specify the `spec.subdomain` field and omit the `spec.host` field of a route. The router deployment that exposes the route will use the `spec.subdomain` value to determine the host name.

You can use this enhancement to simplify sharding by enabling a route to have multiple, distinct host names determined by each router deployment that exposes the route.

[id="ocp-4-11-external-dns-operator"]
==== External DNS Operator

In {product-title} 4.11, the External DNS Operator is available for AWS Route53, Azure DNS, GCP DNS, and Infoblox in General Availability (GA) status. The External DNS Operator is still in Technology Preview (TP) status for BlueCat and AWS Route53 on GovCloud.
With this update, the External DNS Operator provides the following enhancements:

* You can create DNS records on a DNS zone on Infoblox.
* By default, the External DNS Operator creates the operands in the namespace `external-dns-operator`. You do not have to manually create a namespace for the operands and Role-based access control (RBAC) prior to installation.
* You can use the status of the route to retrieve the DNS FQDN names.
* The proxy support for BlueCat DNS provider is now available.
* You can enable the automatic DNS configuration deployment while using the BlueCat DNS provider.

Ensure that you migrate from TP to GA. The upstream version of `ExternalDNS` for an {product-title} 4.11 is `v0.12.0` and for the TP is `v0.10.2`.

[id="ocp-4-11-additional-metallb-CRDs-logging-control"]
==== Support for additional MetalLB CRDs and control over logging verbosity

Additional MetalLB custom resource defintions (CRDs) have been added to support more complex configurations.

The following CRDs have been added:

* `IPAddressPools`
* `L2Advertisement`
* `BGPAdvertisement`
* `Community`

With these enhancements, you can use the Operator for more complex configurations. For example, you can use the enhancements to isolate nodes or segment the network. In addition, the enhancements made to the FRRouting (FRR) logging component allow you to control the verbosity of the logs generated.

[NOTE]
====
The CRDs documented for {product-title} 4.10 and the existing ways to configure MetalLB as described in link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/networking/metallb/about-metallb.html[About MetalLB and the MetalLB Operator] are still supported but deprecated. The `AddressPool` configuration is deprecated.

In 4.10, layer 2 and BGP IP addresses using the `AddressPool` were assigned from different address pools. In {product-title} 4.11, layer 2 and BGP IP addresses can be assigned from the same address pool.

* Alertmanager to 0.24.0
* kube-state-metrics to 2.5.0
* Prometheus to 2.36.2
* Prometheus operator to 0.57.0
* Thanos to 0.26.0

[id=ocp-4-11-monitoring-changes-to-alerting-rules]
==== Changes to alerting rules

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat does not guarantee backward compatibility for recording rules or alerting rules.
====

* *New*
** Added the `KubePersistentVolumeInodesFillingUp` alert, which functions similarly to the existing `KubePersistentVolumeFillingUp` alert but is applied to inodes rather than volume space.
** Added the `PrometheusScrapeBodySizeLimitHit` alert to detect targets hitting the body size limit.
** Added the `PrometheusScrapeSampleLimitHit` alert to detect targets hitting the sample limit.

* *Changed*
** Fixed the `KubeDaemonSetRolloutStuck` alert to use the updated metric `kube_daemonset_status_updated_number_scheduled` from `kube-state-metrics`.
** Replaced the `KubeJobCompletion` alert with `KubeJobNotCompleted`. The new `KubeJobNotCompleted` alert avoids false positives when an earlier job failed but the most recent job succeeded.
** Updated the `NodeNetworkInterfaceFlapping` alert to exclude `tunbr` interfaces from the alert expression.

[id=ocp-4-11-monitoring-enable-alert-routing-for-user-workload-momitoring]
==== Enable alert routing for user workload monitoring
A cluster administrator can now enable alert routing for user workload monitoring so that developers and other users can configure custom alerts and alert routing for their user-defined projects.

[id=ocp-4-11-monitoring-enable-dedicated-alertmanager-for-user-defined-alerts]
==== Enable a dedicated Alertmanager instance for user-defined alerts
You now have the option to enable a separate instance of Alertmanager dedicated to sending alerts only for user-defined projects.
This feature can help reduce the load on the default platform Alertmanager instance and can better separate user-defined alerts from default platform alerts.

[id=ocp-4-11-monitoring-use-additional-authenticaion-settings-for-remote-write]
==== Use additional authentication settings for remote write configuration
You can now use the following authentication methods to access a remote write endpoint: AWS Signature Version 4, custom Authorization header, and OAuth 2.0.
Before this release, you could only use TLS client and basic authentication.

[id=ocp-4-11-monitoring-better-manage-promql-queries-in-web-console]
==== Create, browse, and manage PromQL queries more easily in the web console
The Query Browser on the *Observe* -> *Metrics* page of the {product-title} web console adds various enhancements to improve your ability to create, browse, and manage PromQL queries.
For example, administrators can now duplicate existing queries and use autocomplete suggestions when building and editing queries.

[id=ocp-4-11-monitoring-doubled-scrape-interval-for-servicemonitors-single-node]
====  Scrape interval doubled for ServiceMonitors in single node deployments
The scrape interval has been doubled for all Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) controlled ServiceMonitors on single-node {product-title} deployments.
The maximum interval is now two minutes.

[id=ocp-4-11-monitoring-create-alerting-rules-based-on-platform-metrics]
==== Create alerting rules based on platform monitoring metrics (Technology Preview)
This release introduces a Technology Preview feature in which administrators can create alerting rules based on existing platform monitoring metrics.
This feature helps administrators to more quickly and easily create new alerting rules specific to their environments.

[id=ocp-4-11-monitoring-add-cluster-id-labels-for-remote-write]
==== Add cluster ID labels to remote write storage
You can now add cluster ID labels to metrics being sent to remote write storage.
You can then query these labels to identify the source cluster for a metric and distinguish that metric data from similar metric data sent by other clusters.

[id=ocp-4-11-monitoring-query-metrics-using-federation-endpoint]
==== Query metrics using the federation endpoint for user workload monitoring
You can now use the Prometheus `/federate` endpoint to scrape user-defined metrics from a network location outside the cluster.
Before this release, you could only access the federation endpoint to scrape metrics in default platform monitoring.

[id=ocp-4-11-monitoring-enable-body-size-limit-metrics-scraping]
==== Enable body size limit for metrics scraping for default platform monitoring
You can now set the `enforcedBodySizeLimit` config map option for default platform monitoring to enable a body size limit on metrics scraping.
This setting triggers the new `PrometheusScrapeBodySizeLimitHit` alert when at least one Prometheus scrape target replies with a response body larger than the configured `enforcedBodySizeLimit`.
The setting can limit the impact that a malicious target can have on both the Prometheus component and on the cluster as a whole.

[id=ocp-4-11-monitoring-confgure-retention-size-for-metrics-storage]
==== Configure retention size settings for metrics storage
You can now configure the maximum amount of disk space reserved for retained metrics storage for both default platform monitoring and user-workload monitoring.
Before this release, you could not configure this setting.

[id=ocp-4-11-monitoring-confgure-retention-time-for-thanos-ruler]

[id="ocp-4-11-router-load-balancing-algorithm-default-update"]
==== Update in default value for setting the router load-balancing algorithm

The `haproxy.router.openshift.io/balance` variable, which sets the router load-balancing algorithm, now defaults to the value `random` instead of `leastconn`. See xref:../networking/routes/route-configuration.adoc#nw-route-specific-annotations_route-configuration[Route-specific annotations] for more information.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-11-legacy-service-account"]
==== LegacyServiceAccountTokenNoAutoGeneration is on by default

To align with upstream link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md#urgent-upgrade-notes-1[Kubernetes having moved] the `LegacyServiceAccountTokenNoAutoGeneration` feature gate to beta and enabling it by default, {product-title} now also follows this security feature and releasess with the feature enabled. As a result, when creating new service accounts (SA), a service account token secret is no longer automatically generated. Previously, {product-title} automatically added a service account token to a secret for each new SA.

If you need a service account token secret, you must manually use the TokenRequest API to request bound service account tokens or create a service account token secret.

After updating to {product-version}, existing service account token secrets are not deleted and continue to function as expected.

Service Account token secrets still appear as auto-generated in {product-title} 4.11. However, instead of two secrets per Service Account, there will now be only one, which will be further reduced to zero in a future release. These tokens do not work. For now, dockercfg secrets are still being generated as secrets and no secrets will be deleted during upgrades.

* For information about using the TokenRequest API, see xref:../authentication/bound-service-account-tokens.html#bound-sa-tokens-configuring_bound-service-account-tokens[Using bound service account tokens]

[id="ocp-4-11-removed-features"]
=== Removed features

[id="ocp-4-11-oc-rhel-7"]
==== {op-system-base} 7 support for the OpenShift CLI (oc) has been removed

Support for using {op-system-base-full} 7 with the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) has been removed. If you use the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) with {op-system-base}, you must use {op-system-base} 8 or later.

[id="ocp-4-11-oc-commands-removed"]
==== OpenShift CLI (oc) commands have been removed

The following OpenShift CLI (`oc`) commands were removed with this release:

* `oc adm migrate etcd-ttl`
* `oc adm migrate image-references`
* `oc adm migrate legacy-hpa`
* `oc adm migrate storage`

[id="ocp-4-11-monitoring-grafana-component-removed"]
==== Grafana component removed from monitoring stack
The Grafana component is no longer a part of the {product-title} {product-version} monitoring stack.
As an alternative, go to *Observe* -> *Dashboards* in the {product-title} web console to view monitoring dashboards.

[id="ocp-4-11-monitoring-prometheus-and-grafana-uis-removed"]
==== Prometheus and Grafana user interface access removed from monitoring stack
Access to the third-party Prometheus and Grafana user interfaces have been removed from the {product-title} {product-version} monitoring stack.
As an alternative, click *Observe* in the {product-title} web console to view alerting, metrics, dashboards, and metrics targets for monitoring components.

[id="ocp-4-11-custom-scheduler"]
==== Support for manually deploying a custom scheduler has been removed

Support for deploying custom schedulers manually has been removed with this release. Use the xref:../nodes/scheduling/secondary_scheduler/index.adoc#nodes-secondary-scheduler-about_nodes-secondary-scheduler-about[{secondary-scheduler-operator-full}] instead to deploy a custom secondary scheduler in {product-title}.

[id="ocp-4-11-openshiftsdn-sno-not-supported"]
==== Support for deploying {sno} with OpenShiftSDN has been removed

Support for deploying {sno} clusters with OpenShiftSDN has been removed with this release. OVN-Kubernetes is the default networking solution for {sno} deployments.

==== Removal of Jenkins images from install payload

* {product-title} 4.11 moves the "OpenShift Jenkins" and "OpenShift Agent Base" images to the `ocp-tools-4` repository at `registry.redhat.io` so that Red Hat can produce and update the images outside the {product-title} lifecycle. Previously, these images were in the {product-title} install payload and the `openshift4` repository at `registry.redhat.io`. For more information, see xref:../cicd/jenkins/openshift-jenkins.adoc#openshift-jenkins[OpenShift Jenkins].

* {product-title} 4.11 removes "OpenShift Jenkins Maven" and "NodeJS Agent" images from its payload. Previously, {product-title} 4.10 deprecated these images. Red Hat no longer produces these images, and they are not available from the `ocp-tools-4` repository at `registry.redhat.io`.
+
However, upgrading to {product-title} 4.11 does not remove "OpenShift Jenkins Maven" and "NodeJS Agent" images from 4.10 and earlier releases. And Red Hat provides bug fixes and support for these images through the end of the 4.10 release lifecycle, in accordance with the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} lifecycle policy].
+
For more information, see xref:../cicd/jenkins/openshift-jenkins.adoc#openshift-jenkins[OpenShift Jenkins].

[id="ocp-4-11-future-removals"]
=== Future Kubernetes API removals

The next minor release of {product-title} is expected to use Kubernetes 1.25. Currently, Kubernetes 1.25 is scheduled to remove several deprecated `v1beta1` and `v2beta1` APIs.

See the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-25[Deprecated API Migration Guide] in the upstream Kubernetes documentation for the list of planned Kubernetes API removals.

See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6955985[Navigating Kubernetes API deprecations and removals] for information on how to check your cluster for Kubernetes APIs that are planned for removal.

[id="ocp-4-11-bare-metal-hardware-bug-fixes"]
==== Bare Metal Hardware Provisioning

* Previously, when writing the RHCOS image onto some disks, the `qemu-img` was allocating space onto the entire disk, including sparse areas. This extended the time of the writing process on some hardware. This update disables the `qemu-img` sparse in image creation. As a result, the image writing would no longer take a long time on affected hardware. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2002009[*BZ#2002009*])

* Previously, if the `rotational` field was set for `RootDeviceHints`, the host could fail the provision. With this update, the `rotational` field in `RootDeviceHints` is properly copied and checked. As a result, the provisioning will succeed when using the `rotational` field. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2053721[*BZ#2053721*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-11-builds-bug-fixes"]
==== Builds

* Previously, using a forward slash (`/`) in the `ImageLabel` name of a `BuildConfig` instance resulted in an error. This fix resolves the issue by changing the utility used for validation. As a result, you can use a forward slash in the `ImageLabel` name of a `BuildConfig` instance. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2105167[*BZ#2105167*])

* Previously, when using the `$ oc new-app --search <image_stream_name>` command, you could receive an incorrect message related to `docker.io` images. This resulted in confusion for the user because {product-title} should not be using image streams that point to `docker.io`. This fix adds code checks to prevent the reference to `docker.io`. As a result, the output from that command does not include the message. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049889[*BZ#2049889*])

* Previously, Shared Resource CSI Driver metrics were not exported to the Telemetry service. As a result, usage metrics for the Shared Resource CSI Driver could not be analyzed. With this fix, Shared Resource CSI Driver metrics are exposed to the Telemetry service. As a result, usage metrics for the Shared Resource CSI Driver can be collected and analyzed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2058225[*BZ#2058225*])


* By default, Buildah prints steps to the log file, including the contents of environment variables, which might include xref:../cicd/builds/creating-build-inputs.adoc#builds-input-secrets-configmaps_creating-build-inputs[build input secrets]. Although you can use the `--quiet` build argument to suppress printing of those environment variables, this argument isn't available if you use the source-to-image (S2I) build strategy. The current release fixes this issue. To suppress printing of environment variables, set the `BUILDAH_QUIET` environment variable in your build configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
sourceStrategy:
...
  env:
    - name: "BUILDAH_QUIET"

[id="ocp-4-11-cloud-compute-bug-fixes"]
==== Cloud Compute

* `CertificateSigningRequest` (CSR) resource renewal is handled by the Kubernetes controller manager and correctly left pending by the Cluster Machine Approver Operator, which increases the value of the `mapi_current_pending_csr` metric to `1`. Previously, when the  Kubernetes controller manager approved the CSR, the Operator ignored it and left the metric unchanged. As a result, the `mapi_current_pending_csr` metric was stuck at `1` until the Operator next reconciled. With this release, CSR approvals from other controllers are always reconciled to update metrics and the value of the `mapi_current_pending_csr` metric is updated after every reconcile. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2047702[*BZ#2047702*])

* Previously, only regions contained in a list of known regions within the AWS SDK were validated, and specifying any other region caused an error. This meant that, as new regions were added, they could not be used until the SDK was updated to contain the new region information. With this release, regions are validated with a less strict setting that warns the user when a region is not recognized. As a result, new regions might cause warning messages but can be used immediately. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2065510[*BZ#2065510*])

* Previously, the Cluster Machine Approver Operator appended the `"Approved"` status condition to its condition list. As a result, the Kubernetes API server logged errors containing the message `[SHOULD NOT HAPPEN] failed to update managedFields`. With this release, the Operator is updated to check its conditions before appending to the list, and only update the condition when necessary. As a result, the conditions are no longer duplicated in the `CertificateSigningRequest` resource and the Kubernetes API server no longer logs errors about the duplicate. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1978303[*BZ#1978303*])

* Previously, a defect in the Cisco ACI neutron implementation that was present in {rh-openstack-first} version 16, caused the query for subnets belonging to a given network to return unexpected results. As a result, the {rh-openstack} Cluster API provider might try to provision instances with duplicated ports on the same subnet, leading to a failed provisioning. With this release, additional filtering in the {rh-openstack} Cluster API provider ensures there is no more than one port per subnet, and it is now possible to deploy {product-title} on {rh-openstack} version 16 with Cisco ACI. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2033862[*BZ#2033862*])

* Previously, the {rh-openstack-first} Machine API provider did not use the proxy environment variable directives, causing installation behind an HTTP or HTTPS proxy to fail. With this release, the provider obeys proxy directives and functions correctly in a restricted environment in which egress traffic is only allowed through a proxy.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2046133[*BZ#2046133*])

* Previously, when upgrading from {product-title} 4.9 to 4.10, inconsistencies between multiple controllers resulted in incorrect version numbers. As a result, the version number was not consistent. With this release, consistent reading of version numbers has been enacted and the release version is now stable in the cluster operator status. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2059716[*BZ#2059716*])

* Previously, leaks of load balancer targets on AWS Machine API providers may occur. This is because IP-based load balancer attachments may remain within the load balancer registration when replacing control plane machines. With this release, IP-based load balancer attachments are removed from the load balancer before the Amazon EC2 instance is removed from AWS. As a result, the leaks are avoided. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2065160[*BZ#2065160*])

* Previously, during an upgrade, a new machine created through the Machine API defaulted to HW-13 which caused the cluster to degrade. With this release, the machine controller checks the virtual machine’s hardware version during machine creation from the template clone. The machine goes into a `failed` state if the template’s hardware version is less than 15, which is the minimal supported hardware version for {product-title} 4.11 and above versions. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2059338[*BZ#2059338*])

* Previously, the procedural name generator for Azure availability sets exceeded the 80 character maximum limit. This might cause the Machine API to reuse the same sets during the name truncation, rather than creating multiple availability sets. With this release, the procedural name generator is updated to ensure that the name is no longer than 80 characters and the cluster name is not duplicated in the set name. As a result, Azure availability sets are no longer truncated in unexpected ways by the procedural name generator. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2093044[*BZ#2093044*])

* Because the Cluster Autoscaler Operator was deploying the cluster autoscaler without setting any leader election parameters, the cluster autoscaler could unexpectedly fail and restart after a cluster restart. With this fix, the Cluster Autoscaler Operator now deploys the cluster autoscaler with well-defined leader election flags. As a result, the cluster autoscaler operates as expected after restarts. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2063194[*BZ#2063194*])"

* Previously, certificate signing request (CSR) renewal was handled by `kube-controller-manager` and correctly left pending by the machine approver, which increased `mapi_current_pending_csr` to `1`. Afterwards, the `kube-controller-manager` approved the CSR, but the machine approver would ignore it, which left the metric unchanged. Consequently, the `mapi_current_pending_csr` was stuck at `1` until another machine approver reconciled it. With this update, CSR approvals are reconciled from other controllers to update metrics properly. As a result, `mapi_current_pending_csr` is always up-to-date after every reconcile. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2072195[*BZ#2072195*])

* Previously, the image registry used an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` (ICSP) as a source only when it was an exact match. The same source file was expected to be pulled through for any subrepositories. The ICSP name and path did not match for subrepositories. As a result, the image was not used. Now, the ICSP is applied successfully to the subrepositories, which can use the mirrored images.

==== Machine Config Operator

* Because `keyFile` is not configured as the default plug-in for NetworkManager on RHEL nodes, RHEL nodes might not reach the ready state after a reboot.  With this fix, `keyFile` is set as the default NetworkManager plug-in on all cluster nodes. As a result, nodes correctly reach the ready state after a reboot. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2060133[*BZ#2060133*])

* Because vSphere UPI clusters do not set the `PlatformStatus.VSphere` parameter at installation, the parameter was set to `nil`. This caused the MCO logs to be filled with unnecessary and repetitive messages that this parameter cannot have the value `nil`. This fix removes the warning, which was added to resolve a separate issue. As a result, the logs no longer list this message for vSphere UPI installations.

* Previously, the web console was not properly authenticating permissions when approving `InstallPlans`. This resulted in a possible unhandled error. With this update, permissions were altered for consistency and error messages are now displayed correctly in the web console. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2006067[*BZ#2006067*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-11-monitoring-bug-fixes"]
==== Monitoring

* Before this update, dashboards in the {product-title} web console that contained queries using a container label for `container_fs*` metrics returned no data points because the container labels had been dropped due to high cardinality.
This update resolves the issue, and these dashboards now display data as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2037513[*BZ#2037513*])

* Before this update, the `prometheus-operator` component allowed any time value for `ScrapeTimeout` in the config map.
If you set `ScrapeTimeout` to a value greater than the `ScrapeInterval` value, Prometheus would stop loading the config map settings and fail to apply all subsequent configuration changes.
With this update, if the `ScrapeTimeout` value specified is greater than the `ScrapeInterval` value, the system logs the settings as invalid, but continues loading the other config map settings.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2037762[*BZ#2037762*])

* Before this update, in the *CPU Utilisation* panel on the *Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Cluster* dashboard in the {product-title} web console, the formula used to calculate the CPU utilization of a node could incorrectly display invalid negative values.
With this update, the formula has been updated, and the *CPU Utilisation* panel now shows correct values.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2040635[*BZ#2040635*])

* Before this update, data from the `prometheus-adapter` component could not be accessed during the automatic update that occurs every 15 days because the update process removed old pods before the new pods became available.
With this release, the automatic update process now only removes old pods after the new pods are able to serve requests so that data from the old pods continues to be available during the update process.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2048333[*BZ#2048333*])

* Before this update, the following metrics were incorrectly missing from `kube-state-metrics`: `kube_pod_container_status_terminated_reason`, `kube_pod_init_container_status_terminated_reason`, and `kube_pod_status_scheduled_time`.
With this release, `kube-state-metrics` correctly exposes these metrics so that they are available.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2050120[*BZ#2050120*])

* Before this update, if invalid write relabel config map settings existed for the `prometheus-operator` component, the configuration would still load all subsequent settings.
With this release, the component checks for valid write relabel settings when loading the configuration.
If invalid settings exist, an error is logged, and the configuration loading process stops.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2051470[*BZ#2051470*])

* Before this update, the `init-config-reloader` container for the Prometheus pods requested `100m` of CPU and `50Mi` of memory, even though in practice the container needed fewer resources.
With this update, the container requests `1m` of CPU and `10Mi` of memory. These settings are consistent with the settings of the `config-reloader` container.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2057025[*BZ#2057025*])

* Before this update, when an administrator enabled user workload monitoring, the `user-workload-monitoring-config` config map was not automatically created.
Because non-administrator users with the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role did not have permission to create the config map manually, they depended on an administrator to create it.
With this update, the `user-workload-monitoring-config` config map is now automatically created when an administrator enables user workload monitoring and is available to edit by users with the appropriate role.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2065577[*BZ#2065577*])

* Before this update, after you deleted a deployment, the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) did not wait for the deletion to be completed, which caused reconciliation errors.
With this update, the CMO now waits until deployments are deleted before recreating them, which resolves this issue.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2069068[*BZ#2069068*])

* Before this update, for user workload monitoring, if you configured external labels for metrics in Prometheus, the CMO did not correctly propagate these labels to Thanos Ruler.
If you queried external metrics for user-defined projects, not provided by the user workload monitoring instance of Prometheus, you would sometimes not see external labels for these metrics even though you had configured Prometheus to add them. With this update, the CMO now properly propagates the external labels that you configured in Prometheus to Thanos Ruler, and you can see the labels when you query external metrics. Thus, for user-defined projects, if you queried external metrics not provided by the user workload monitoring instance of Prometheus, you would sometimes not see external labels for these metrics even though you had configured Prometheus to add them. With this update, the CMO now properly propagates the external labels that you configured in Prometheus to Thanos Ruler, and you can see the labels when you query external metrics.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2073112[*BZ#2073112*])

* Before this update, the `tunbr` interface incorrectly triggered the `NodeNetworkInterfaceFlapping` alert.
With this update, the `tunbr` interface is now included in the list of interfaces that the alert ignores and no longer causes the alert to trigger incorrectly.

[id="ocp-4-11-ne-perf-improvements"]
==== Networking performance improvements
* Previously, a `systemd` service set a default RPS mask according to the reserved CPUs list in the performance profile for all network devices visible from udev excluding virtual devices. A `crio` hook script set the RPS mask of all network devices visible from /sys/devices for guaranteed pods. This resulted in multiple impacts to network performance.
In this update, `systemd` service only sets the default RPS mask for virtual interfaces under /sys/devices/virtual. The `crio` hook script now also excludes physical devices. This configuration mitigates issues such as overloading of processes, lengthy polling intervals, and spikes in latency.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-11-node-bug-fixes"]
==== Node

* Previously, the pod manager handled the registration and de-registration of pod secrets and config maps. Because of this, pod secrets would sometimes fail to be mounted within a pod. With this fix, the pod ID is included in the key that the kublet uses to manage registered pods. As a result, secrets are properly mounted as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1999325[*BZ#1999325*])

* Because of a memory leak in the garbage collection process, pods might not be able to start on a node due to lack of memory. With this fix memory is no longer leaking in the garbage collection process and nodes should start as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2065749[*BZ#2065749*])

* Because of a change in the upstream Kubernetes, the kubelet was not running readiness probes on terminated pods. As a result, a load balancer or controller could react more slowly to a terminating pod, which might have resulted in errors. With this fix, readiness probes are again being performed on pod termination. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2089933[*BZ#2089933*])

* Because of a bug, the kubelet could incorrectly reject pods that have `OutOfCpu` errors, if the pods were rapidly scheduled after other pods were reported as complete in the API. With this fix, the kubelet now waits to report the phase of a pod as terminal in the API until all running containers have stopped and no new containers have been started. Short-lived pods may take slightly longer, approximately 1s, to report either success or failure after this change. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2022507[*BZ#2022507*])

* Because recent versions of the `prometheus-adapter` are sending additional pod metrics, the Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) recommender is producing a large number of unnecessary and repetitive messages. With this fix, the VPA recognizes and ignores the extra metrics. As a result, these messages are no longer being produced. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102947[*BZ#2102947*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-11-openshift-cli-bug-fixes"]
==== OpenShift CLI (oc)

* Previously, `oc` catalog mirroring failed if an older, deprecated image version was used as the source. Now, the image manifest version is detected automatically and mirroring works successfully. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049133[*BZ#2049133*])

* Previously, it was hard to understand from the logs when fallback inspect occured. The logs are now improved to make this more explicit. As a result, the output of `must-gather run` is much more clear. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2035717[*BZ#2035717*])

* Previously, if you ran `must-gather` with invalid arguments, it did not consistently report the error and instead might attempt to collect data even when that is not possible. Now if `must-gather` is called with invalid options, it provides useful error output. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1999891[BZ#1999891])

* Previously, if the `oc adm catalog mirror` command resulted in errors, it still continued and returned a `0` exit code. A `--continue-on-error` flag is now available that allows users to determine whether the command should continue if there are errors, or exit with a non-zero exit code. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2088483[*BZ#2088483*])

* With this update, a `--subresource` flag was added to the `oc adm policy who-can` command to check who can perform a specified action on a subresource. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1905850[*BZ#1905850*])

* Previously, users were unable to use tab completion for the `oc project` command. Now, hitting tab after `oc project` properly lists projects. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1905850[*BZ#1905850*])

* Previously, startup probes were not removed from debug pods, which could cause issues with the debug pods if the startup probe failed. The `--keep-startup` flag has been added, which is `false` by default, meaning that startup probes are removed by default from debug pods. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2056122[*BZ#2056122*])

* Previously, there was no timeout specified after invoking `oc debug node`, so users were never logged out of the cluster. A `TMOUT` environment variable has been added, so that after the specified time of inactivity, the session is automatically terminated. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2043314[*BZ#2043314*])

* With this update, `oc login` now shows the URL for the web console even when users are logged out. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1957668[*BZ#1957668*])

* Previously, the `oc rsync` command displayed a wrong error output when the container was not found. With this release, the `oc rsync` command displays the correct error message when the specific container is not running. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2057633[*BZ#2057633*])

* Previously, large images could not be pruned if they were new to the cluster. This caused recent images to be omitted when filtering the over sized images. With this release, you can now prune images that exceed the given size. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2083999[*BZ#2083999*])

* Previously, there was a typo in the `gather` script. As a result, insights data was not collected properly. With this release, the typo is corrected and Insights data is now properly collected through the `must-gather`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2106543[*BZ#2106543*])

* Previously, you could not apply the `EgressNetworkPolicy` resource type in your cluster through the `oc` CLI. With this release, you can now create, update, and delete an `EgressNetworkPolicy` resource. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2071614[*BZ#2071614*])

* Before this update, invalid subscription labels were created when a resource name exceeded 63 characters. Truncating labels that exceed the 63-character limit resolves the issue, and the subscription resource no longer rejects the Kubernetes API. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2016425[*BZ#2016425*])

* Before this update, catalog source pods for the Marketplace Operator prevented nodes from draining. As a result, the Cluster Autoscaler could not scale down effectively. With this update, adding the `cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict` annotation to the catalog source pods fixes the issue, and the Cluster Autoscaler can scale down effectively. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2053343[*BZ#2053343*])

* Before this update, the `collect-profiles` job could take a long time to complete in certain circumstances, such as when a pod could not be scheduled. As a result, if enough jobs were scheduled but unable to run, the number of scheduled jobs exceeded pod quota limits. With this update, only one `collect-profiles` pod exists at a time, and the `collect-profiles` job does not exceed pod quota limits. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2055861[*BZ#2055861*])

* Before this update, the package server was not aware of pod topology when defining its leader election duration, renewal deadline, and retry periods. As a result, the package server strained topologies with limited resources, such as single-node environments. This update introduces a `leaderElection` package that sets reasonable lease duration, renewal deadlines, and retry periods. This fix reduces strain on clusters with limited resources. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2048563[*BZ#2048563*])

* Previously, there was a bad catalog source in the `openshift-marketplace` namespace. Because of this, all subscriptions were blocked. With this update, if there is a bad catalog source in the `openshift-marketplace` namespace, users can subscribe to an operator from a quality catalog source of their own namespace with the original annotation. As a result, if there is a bad catalog source in the local namespace, the user cannot subscribe to any operator in the namespace. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2076323[*BZ2076323])

* Previously, info-level logs were generated during `operator-marketplace` project polling, which caused log spam. This update uses the command line flag to reduce the log line to the debug level, and adds more control of the log levels for the user. As a result, this reduces log spam. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2057558[*BZ#2057558*])

* Previously, each component managed by the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) consisted of YAML files defined in the `/manifest` directory in the root of a project's repo. When removing a YYAML file from the `/manifest` directory, you needed to add the `release.openshift.io/delete: “true”` annotation, otherwise the CVO would not delete the resources from the cluster. This update reintroduces any resources that were removed from the `/manifest` directory and adds the `release.openshift.io/delete: “true”` annotation so that the CVO cleans up the resources. As a result, resources that are no longer required for the OLM component are removed from the cluster. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1975543[*BZ#1975543*])

* Previously, the CheckRegistryServer function used by GRPC catalog sources did not confirm the existence of the service account associated with the catalog source. This caused the existence of an unhealthy catalog source with no service account. With this update, the GRPC `CheckRegistryServer` function checks if the service account exists and recreates the service if it is not found. As a result, the OLM recreates service accounts owned by GRPC catalog souces if they do not exist. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1975543[*BZ#1975543*])

* Previously, in an error message that occurred when users ran `opm index prune` against a file-based catalog image, imprecise language made it unclear that this command does not support that catalog format. This update clarifies the error message so users understand that the command `opm index prune` only supports SQLite-based images. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2039135[*BZ#2039135*])

==== OpenShift API server

* Because multiple Authentication Operator controllers were synchronizing at the same time, the Authentication Operator was taking too long to react to changes to its configuration. This feature adds jitter to the regular synchronization periods so that the Authentication Operator controllers do not race for resources. As a result, it now takes less time for the Authentication Operator to react to configuration changes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1958198[*BZ#1958198*])"

* With {product-title} 4.11, authentication attempts from external identity providers are now logged to the audit logs. As a result, you can view successful, failed, and errored login attempts from external identity providers in the audit logs. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2086465[*BZ#2086465*])"

* Before this update, if a machine was booted through PXE and the `BOOTIF` argument was on the kernel command line, the machine would boot with DHCP enabled on only a single interface. With this update, the machine boots with DHCP enabled on all interfaces even if the `BOOTIF` argument is provided. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2032717[BZ#2032717])

* Previously, nodes that were provisioned from VMware OVA images did not delete the Ignition config after initial provisioning. Consequently, this created security issues when secrets are stored within the Ignition config. With this update, the Ignition config is now deleted from the VMware hypervisor after initial provisioning on new nodes and when upgrading from a previous {product-title} release on existing nodes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2082274[BZ#2082274])

* Previously, any arguments provided to the `toolbox` command were ignored when the command wasfirst invoked. This fix updates the toolbox script to initiate the `podman container create` command followed by the `podman start` and `podman exec` commands. It also modifies the script to handle multiple arguments and whitespaces as an array. As a result, the arguments passed to the `toolbox` command are executed every time as expected.

* Before this update, the *Git Import* form displayed an error message when an invalid devfile repository (older than devfile v2.2) is entered. With this update, the error message states that devfiles older than v2.2 are not supported. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2046435[*BZ#2046435*])

* Before this update, if the *ConsoleLink CR* (openshift-blog) was not available in the cluster, the blog link was undefined. Clicking on the blog link did not redirect to the OpenShift blog. With this update, a fall back link to https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift/whats-new is added even if the *ConsoleLink CR* (openshift-blog) is not present in the cluster. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2050637[*BZ#2050637*])

* Before this update, the API version for the kafka CR was updated. This version did not support the old version, so an empty *Bootstrap server* was displayed on *Create Event Source - KafkaSource* even if it was created. With this update, the updated APIs for the Kafka CR support the old versions and renders the *Bootstrap server* list in *Create Event Source - KafkaSource* form. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2058623[*BZ#2058623*])

* Before this update, when you used the *Import from Git* form to import a private Git repository, the correct import type and a builder image were not identified because the secret to fetch the private repository details was not decoded. With this update, the *Import from Git* form decodes the secret to fetch the private repository details. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2053501[*BZ#2053501*])

* Before this update, from the developer perspective, the *Observe* dashboard opened for the most recently viewed workload rather than the one you selected in the *Topology* view. This issue happens because the session prefers the redux store instead of the query parameters in the URL. With this update, the *Observe* dashboard renders components based on the query parameters in the URL. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2052953[*BZ#2052953*])

* Before this update, the *Pipeline* used to start with the hardcoded value `gp2` as the default storage class even if it did not exist on the cluster. With this update, you can use the default specified storage class name instead of a hardcoded value. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2084635[*BZ#2084635*])

* Before this update, while running high-volume pipeline logs, the auto-scroll functionality does not work and logs display older messages. Running high-volume pipeline logs generates a large number of calls to the `scrollIntoView` method. With this update, high-volume pipeline logs do not generate any calls to the `scrollIntoView` method and gives a smooth auto-scroll functionality. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2014161[*BZ#2014161*])

* Before this update, when creating a *RoleBinding* using the *Create RoleBinding* form, the subject name was mandatory. A missing subject name fails to load the *Project Access* tab. With this update, the *RoleBinding* without the *Subject Name* property is not listed in the *Project Access* tab. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2051558[*BZ#2051558*])

* Before this update, the sink and trigger for event sources showed all the resources, even though those are standalone or part of backing the `k-native service`, `Broker`, or `KameletBinding`. The addressed resources used to show in the sink dropdown list. With this update, a filter has been added to show only standalone resources as sink. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2054285[*BZ#2054285*])

* Before this update, the empty tabs in the sidebar of the topology view were not filtered out before rendering. This displayed invalid tabs for *Workloads* in the topology view. With this update, the empty tabs are filtered properly before rendering. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049483[*BZ#2049483*])

* Before this update, when a pipeline is started using the *Start Last Run* button, the `started-by` annotation of the created `PipelineRun` was not updated to the correct username so the triggered by section did not show the correct username. With this update, the `started-by` annotation value is updated to the correct username and the triggered by section shows the username of the correct user that started the pipeline. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2046618[*BZ#2046618*])

* Before this update, the `ProjectHelmChartRepository` CR does not show up in the cluster. Consequently, the API schema for this CR has not been initialized in the cluster yet. With this update the `ProjectHelmChartRepository` shows up in the cluster. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2054197[*BZ#2054197*])

* Before this update, when you navigate using a keyboard in the topology, the selected items were not highlighted. With this update, navigation using a keyboard highlights and updates styles to the selected items. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2039277[*BZ#2039277*])

* Before this update, the layout of the web terminal opened outside of the default view and could not be resized. With this update, the web terminal opens inside the default view and resizes properly. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2022253[*BZ#2022253*])

* Before this update, some of the sidebar items did not contain namespace context. Consequently, when links were opened from another browser, or opening links from a different active namespace, the web console does not switch to the correct namespace. With this update, the correct namespace is selected when opening the URL. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2039647[*BZ#2039647*])

[id="ocp-4-11-known-issues"]
== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.8 and beyond! This needs some SME/QE review before being updated for 4.11. Need to check if KI should be removed or should stay.
* In {product-title} 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.
+
If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.1 to 4.8, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. Unless there is a specific need for unauthenticated access, you should revoke it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP `403` errors if you revoke unauthenticated access.
====
+
Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:
+
[source,bash]
----
## Snippet to remove unauthenticated group from all the cluster role bindings
$ for clusterrolebinding in cluster-status-binding discovery system:basic-user system:discovery system:openshift:discovery ;
do
### Find the index of unauthenticated group in list of subjects
index=$(oc get clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} -o json | jq 'select(.subjects!=null) | .subjects | map(.name=="system:unauthenticated") | index(true)');
### Remove the element at index from subjects array
oc patch clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} --type=json --patch "[{'op': 'remove','path': '/subjects/$index'}]";
done
----
+
This script removes unauthenticated subjects from the following cluster role bindings:
+
--
** `cluster-status-binding`
** `discovery`
** `system:basic-user`
** `system:discovery`
** `system:openshift:discovery`
--
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821771[*BZ#1821771*])

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.9 and beyond!
* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])

* In the monitoring stack, if you have enabled and deployed a dedicated Alertmanager instance for user-defined alerts, you cannot silence alerts in the *Developer* perspective in the {product-title} web console.
No workaround exists for this issue.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2100860[*BZ#2100860*])

* On a newly installed {product-title} {product-version} cluster, platform monitoring alerts do not have the `openshift_io_alert_source="platform"` label.
This issue does not affect clusters upgraded from a previous minor version.
No workaround exists for this issue.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2103127[*BZ#2103127*])

* In the {rh-openstack-first}, a potential issue can affect Kuryr when the ports pools are populated with a variety of bulk port creation requests made at the same time. During these bulk requests, if the IP allocation for one of the IP addresses fails, the Neutron retries the operation for all ports. This issue was resolved in a previous errata; however, Red Hat suggests setting a small value for the ports pools batch to avoid large bulk port creation requests. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2024690[*BZ2024690*])

* The oc-mirror CLI plug-in cannot mirror {product-title} catalogs earlier than version 4.9. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2097210[*BZ#2097210*])

* The oc-mirror CLI plug-in can fail to upload an image set to the target mirror registry if the `archiveSize` value in the image set configuration is smaller than the container image size, causing the catalog directory to span multiple archives. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2106461[*BZ#2106461*])

* In {product-title} 4.11, the MetalLB Operator scope has changed from namespace to cluster and this results in upgrading from a prior version failing.
+
As a workaround, remove the previous version of the MetalLB Operator. Do not delete the namespace or the instance of the MetalLB custom resource, and deploy the new Operator version. This keeps MetalLB running and configured.
+
For more information, see xref:../networking/metallb/metallb-upgrading-operator.adoc#metallb-upgrading-operator[Upgrading the MetalLB Operator]. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2100180[*BZ#2100180*])

* The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) for {product-title} 4.11 does not work properly on macOS due to a change in error handling of untrusted certificates in Go 1.18 libraries. Due to this change, `oc login` and other `oc` commands can fail with a `certificate is not trusted` error without proceeding further when running on macOS. Until the error handling is properly fixed in Go 1.18 (tracked by link:https://github.com/golang/go/issues/52010[Go issue #52010]), the workaround is to use the {product-title} 4.10 `oc` CLI instead. Note that when using the {product-title} 4.10 `oc` CLI with an {product-title} 4.11 cluster, it is no longer possible to get a token by using the `oc serviceaccounts get-token <service_account>` command. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2097830[*BZ#2097830*]) (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2109799[*BZ#2109799*])

* There is currently a known issue in the *Add Helm Chart Repositories* form to extend the Developer Catalog of a project. The *Quick Start* guides shows that you can add the `ProjectHelmChartRepository` CR in the desired namespace whereas it does not mention that to perform this you need permission from the kubeadmin. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2054197[BZ#2054197])

* There is currently a known issue. If you create an instance of `ProjectHelmChartRepository` custom resource (CR) that uses TLS verification, you cannot list the repositories and perform Helm-related operations. There is currently no workaround for this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/HELM-343[*HELM-343*])

* If the pruner fails, the Image Registry Operator is degraded until the pruner successfully runs. By default, the pruner runs once a day. As a workaround, you can give it more opportunities to run successfully by configuring it to run more often. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1990125[*BZ#1990125*])

All {product-title} {product-version} errata is https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[available on the Red Hat Customer Portal]. See the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} Life Cycle] for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account settings for Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications are enabled, users are notified through email whenever new errata relevant to their registered systems are released.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming {product-title} entitlements for {product-title} errata notification emails to generate.
====

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of {product-title} {product-version}. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form {product-title} {product-version}.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.

[IMPORTANT]
