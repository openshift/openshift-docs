==== Kubernetes NMState in VMWare vSphere now supported
Beginning with {product-title} {product-version}, you can configure the networking settings such as DNS servers or search domains, VLANs, bridges, and interface bonding using the Kubernetes NMState Operator on your VMware vSphere instance.

For more information, see xref:../networking/k8s_nmstate/k8s-nmstate-about-the-k8s-nmstate-operator.adoc[About the Kubernetes NMState Operator].
[id="overriding-default-node-ip-selection-logic"]
==== Node IP selection improvements 

Previously, the `nodeip-configuration` service on a cluster host selected the IP address from the interface that the default route used. If multiple routes were present, the service would select the route with the lowest metric value. As a result, network traffic could be distributed from the incorrect interface. 

With {product-title} 4.12, a new interface has been added to the `nodeip-configuration` service, which allows users to create a hint file. The hint file contains a variable, `NODEIP_HINT`, that overrides the default IP selection logic and selects a specific node IP address from the subnet `NODEIP_HINT` variable. Using the `NODEIP_HINT` variable allows users to specify which IP address is used, ensuring that network traffic is distributed from the correct interface. 

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-installation-workflow.adoc#overriding-default-node-ip-selection-logic_ipi-install-installation-workflow[Optional: Overriding the default node IP selection logic]. 

[id="ocp-4-12-nw-external-dns-operator"]
==== External DNS Operator

In {product-title} 4.12, the External DNS Operator modifies the format of the ExternalDNS wildcard TXT records on AzureDNS. The External DNS Operator replaces the asterisk with `any` in ExternalDNS wildcard TXT records. You must avoid the ExternalDNS wildcard A and CNAME records having `any` leftmost subdomain because this might cause a conflict.

[id="ocp-4-12-nw-ingress-autoscaling"]
==== Ingress Controller Autoscaling

You can now use the {product-title} Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator to dynamically scale the default Ingress Controller based on metrics in your deployed cluster, such as the number of worker nodes available.

For more information, see xref:../networking/ingress-operator.adoc#nw-autoscaling-ingress-controller[Autoscaling an Ingress Controller].

[id="ocp-4-12-nw-configure-dns-management"]
==== Configuration of an Ingress Controller for manual DNS management

You can now configure an Ingress Controller to stop automatic DNS management and start manual DNS management. Set the `dnsManagementPolicy` parameter to specify automatic or manual DNS management.

For more information, see xref:../networking/ingress-controller-dnsmgt.adoc#ingress-controller-dnsmgt[Configuring an Ingress Controller to manually manage DNS].

[id="ocp-4-12-networking-supported-hardware-for-sr-iov"]
==== Supported hardware for SR-IOV (Single Root I/O Virtualization)

{product-title} 4.12 adds support for the following SR-IOV devices:

* MT2892 Family [ConnectX&#8209;6{nbsp}Dx]
* MT42822 BlueField&#8209;2 in ConnectX&#8209;6 NIC mode
* Silicom STS Family

For more information, see xref:../networking/hardware_networks/about-sriov.adoc#supported-devices_about-sriov[Supported devices].

[id="ocp-4-12-switch-aws-load-balancer"]
==== Switch between AWS load balancer types without deleting the Ingress Controller

You can update the Ingress Controller to switch between an AWS Classic Load Balancer (CLB) and an AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB) without deleting the Ingress Controller.

For more information, see xref:../networking/configuring_ingress_cluster_traffic/configuring-ingress-cluster-traffic-aws.adoc[Configuring ingress cluster traffic on AWS].

[id="ocp-4-12-known-issues"]
== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.8 and beyond! This needs some SME/QE review before being updated for 4.11. Need to check if KI should be removed or should stay.
* In {product-title} 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.
+
If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.1 to 4.8, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. Unless there is a specific need for unauthenticated access, you should revoke it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP `403` errors if you revoke unauthenticated access.
====
+
Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:
+
[source,bash]
----
## Snippet to remove unauthenticated group from all the cluster role bindings
$ for clusterrolebinding in cluster-status-binding discovery system:basic-user system:discovery system:openshift:discovery ;
do
### Find the index of unauthenticated group in list of subjects
index=$(oc get clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} -o json | jq 'select(.subjects!=null) | .subjects | map(.name=="system:unauthenticated") | index(true)');
### Remove the element at index from subjects array
oc patch clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} --type=json --patch "[{'op': 'remove','path': '/subjects/$index'}]";
done
----
+
This script removes unauthenticated subjects from the following cluster role bindings:

--
** `cluster-status-binding`
** `discovery`
** `system:basic-user`
** `system:discovery`
** `system:openshift:discovery`
--

* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value.

[id="ocp-4-12-asynchronous-errata-updates"]
== Asynchronous errata updates

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for {product-title} {product-version} are released as asynchronous errata through the Red Hat Network. All {product-title} {product-version} errata is https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[available on the Red Hat Customer Portal]. See the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} Life Cycle] for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account settings for Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications are enabled, users are notified through email whenever new errata relevant to their registered systems are released.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming {product-title} entitlements for {product-title} errata notification emails to generate.
====

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of {product-title} {product-version}. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form {product-title} {product-version}.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any {product-title} release, always review the instructions on xref:../updating/updating-cluster-within-minor.adoc#updating-cluster-within-minor[updating your cluster] properly.
