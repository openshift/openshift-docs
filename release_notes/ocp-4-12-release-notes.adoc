[id="ocp-4-12-new-features-and-enhancements"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

[id="ocp-4-12-rhcos"]
=== {op-system-first}

[id="ocp-4-12-default-graphical-console"]
==== Default consoles for new clusters are now determined by the installation platform
{op-system-first} nodes installed from an {product-title} {product-version} boot image now use a platform-specific default console. The default consoles on cloud platforms correspond to the specific system consoles expected by that cloud provider. VMware and OpenStack images now use a primary graphical console and a secondary serial console. Other bare metal installations now use only the graphical console by default, and do not enable a serial console. Installations performed with `coreos-installer` can override existing defaults and enable the serial console.

Existing nodes are not affected. New nodes on existing clusters are not likely to be affected because they are typically installed from the boot image that was originally used to install the cluster.

For information about how to enable the serial console, see the following documentation:

* xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.adoc#installation-user-infra-machines-advanced-console-configuration_installing-bare-metal[Default console configuration].

* xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.adoc#installation-user-infra-machines-advanced-customizing-live-iso-serial-console_installing-bare-metal[Modifying a live install ISO image to enable the serial console].

* xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.adoc#installation-user-infra-machines-advanced-customizing-live-pxe-serial-console_installing-bare-metal[Modifying a live install PXE environment to enable the serial console].

[id="ocp-4-12-secure-execution-z-linux-one"]
==== IBM Secure Execution on {ibmzProductName} and LinuxONE (Technology Preview)
{product-title} now supports configuring {op-system-first} nodes for IBM Secure Execution on {ibmzProductName} and LinuxONE (s390x architecture) as a Technology Preview feature. IBM Secure Execution is a hardware enhancement that protects memory boundaries for KVM guests. IBM Secure Execution provides the highest level of isolation and security for cluster workloads, and you can enable it by using an IBM Secure Execution-ready QCOW2 boot image.

To use IBM Secure Execution, you must have host keys for your host machine(s) and they must be specified in your Ignition configuration file. IBM Secure Execution automatically encrypts your boot volumes using LUKS encryption.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_ibm_z/installing-ibm-z-kvm.adoc#installing-rhcos-using-ibm-secure-execution_installing-ibm-z-kvm[Installing {op-system} using IBM Secure Execution].

[id="ocp-4-12-rhcos-rhel-8-6-packages"]
==== {op-system} now uses {op-system-base} 8.6

{op-system} now uses {op-system-base-full} 8.6 packages in {product-title} {product-version}. This enables you to have the latest fixes, features, and enhancements, as well as the latest hardware support and driver updates. {product-title} 4.10 is an Extended Update Support (EUS) release that will continue to use RHEL 8.4 EUS packages for the entirety of its lifecycle.

[id="ocp-4-12-admin-ack-upgrading"]
==== Required administrator acknowledgment when upgrading from {product-title} 4.11 to 4.12

{product-title} 4.12 uses Kubernetes 1.25, which removed xref:../release_notes/ocp-4-12-release-notes.adoc#ocp-4-12-removed-kube-1-25-apis[several deprecated APIs].

A cluster administrator must provide a manual acknowledgment before the cluster can be upgraded from {product-title} 4.11 to 4.12. This is to help prevent issues after upgrading to {product-title} 4.12, where APIs that have been removed are still in use by workloads, tools, or other components running on or interacting with the cluster. Administrators must evaluate their cluster for any APIs in use that will be removed and migrate the affected components to use the appropriate new API version. After this is done, the administrator can provide the administrator acknowledgment.

All {product-title} 4.11 clusters require this administrator acknowledgment before they can be upgraded to {product-title} 4.12.

For more information, see xref:../updating/updating-cluster-prepare.adoc#updating-cluster-prepare[Preparing to update to {product-title} 4.12].

[id="ocp-4-12-feature-set"]
==== Enabling a feature set when installing a cluster
Beginning with {product-title} {product-version}, you can enable a feature set as part of the installation process. A feature set is a collection of {product-title} features that are not enabled by default.

For more information about enabling a feature set during installation, see xref:../nodes/clusters/nodes-cluster-enabling-features.adoc#nodes-cluster-enabling[Enabling {product-title} features using feature gates].

[id="ocp-4-12-agent-based-install-dhcp"]
==== Agent-based installation supports DHCP
With the Agent-based {product-title} Installer, you can deploy to environments where you rely on DHCP to configure networking for all the nodes, as long as you know the IP that at least one of the systems will receive. This IP is required so that all nodes use it as a meeting point.
For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer.adoc#dhcp[DHCP].

[id="ocp-4-12-nutanix-restricted-install"]
==== Installing a cluster on Nutanix with limited internet access
You can now install a cluster on Nutanix when the environment has limited access to to the internet, as in the case of a disconnected or restricted network cluster. With this type of installation, you create a registry that mirrors the contents of the {product-title} image registry and contains the installation media. You can create this registry on a mirror host, which can access both the internet and your closed network.

For more information, see xref:../installing/disconnected_install/index.adoc#installing-mirroring-disconnected-about[About disconnected installation mirroring] and xref:../installing/installing_nutanix/installing-restricted-networks-nutanix-installer-provisioned.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-nutanix-installer-provisioned[Installing a cluster on Nutanix in a restricted network].

[id="support-for-dual-stack-addressing-for-the-API-VIP-and-Ingress-VIP"]
==== Support for dual-stack addressing for the API VIP and Ingress VIP
{ai-full} supports installation of {product-title} 4.12 and later versions with dual stack networking for the API VIP and Ingress VIP on bare metal only. This support introduces two new configuration settings: `api_vips` and `ingress_vips`, which can take a list of IP addresses. The legacy settings, `api_vip` and `ingress_vip` must also be set in {product-title} 4.12; however, since they only take one IP address, you must set the IPv4 address when configuring dual stack networking for the API VIP and Ingress VIP with the legacy `api_vip` and `ingress_vip` configuration settings.

The API VIP address and the Ingress VIP address must be of the primary IP address family when using dual-stack networking. Currently, Red Hat does not support dual-stack VIPs or dual-stack networking with IPv6 as the primary IP address family. However, Red Hat does support dual-stack networking with IPv4 as the primary IP address family. Therefore, you must place the IPv4 entries before the IPv6 entries. See the {ai-full} documentation for details.

[id="ocp-4-12-redhat-openshift-networking"]

[id="ocp-4-12-nw-aws-load-balancer-operator"]
==== AWS Load Balancer Operator

In {product-title} 4.12, the AWS Load Balancer controller now implements the Kubernetes Ingress specification for multiple matches. If multiple paths within an Ingress match a request, the longest matching path takes the precedence. If two paths still match, paths with an exact path type take precedence over a prefix path type.

The AWS Load Balancer Operator sets the `EnableIPTargetType` feature gate to `false`. The AWS Load Balancer controller disables the support for services and ingress resources for `target-type` `ip`.

The upstream version of `aws-load-balancer-controller` for an {product-title} 4.12 is v2.4.4.

[id="ocp-4-12-ipv6-gratuitous-ARPs-default-SR-IOV"]
==== IPv6 unsolicited neighbor advertisements and IPv4 gratuitous address resolution protocol now default on the SR-IOV CNI plugin

Pods created with the Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) CNI plugin, where the IP address management CNI plugin has assigned IPs, now send IPv6 unsolicited neighbor advertisements and/or IPv4 gratuitous address resolution protocol by default onto the network. This enhancement notifies hosts of the new pod's MAC address for a particular IP to refresh ARP/NDP caches with the correct information.

For more information, see xref:../networking/hardware_networks/about-sriov.adoc#supported-devices_about-sriov[Supported devices].

[id="ocp-4-12-coredns-cache-tuning"]
==== Support for CoreDNS cache tuning

You can now configure the time-to-live (TTL) duration of both successful and unsuccessful DNS queries cached by CoreDNS.

For more information, see xref:../networking/dns-operator.adoc#nw-dns-cache-tuning_dns-operator[Tuning the CoreDNS cache].

[id="ocp-4-12-ovn-kubernetes-supports-configuration-internal-subnet"]
==== OVN-Kubernetes supports configuration of internal subnet

Previously, the subnet that OVN-Kubernetes uses internally was `100.64.0.0/16` for IPv4 and `fd98::/48` for IPv6 and could not be modified. To support instances when these subnets overlap with existing subnets in your infrastructure, you can now change these internal subnets to avoid any overlap.

For more information, see xref:../networking/cluster-network-operator.adoc#nw-operator-cr-cno-object_cluster-network-operator[Cluster Network Operator configuration object]

[id=ocp-4-12-egress-ip-support]
==== Egress IP support on {rh-openstack-first}

{rh-openstack}, paired with {product-title}, now supports automatic attachment and detachment of Egress IP addresses. The traffic from one or more pods in any number of namespaces has a consistent source IP address for services outside of the cluster. This support applies to OpenShift SDN and OVN-Kubernetes as default network providers.

[id="ocp-4-12-openshift-sdn-ovn-kubernetes-feature-migration-support"]
==== OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes feature migration support

If you plan to migrate from the OpenShift SDN network plugin to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, your configurations for the following capabilities are automatically converted to work with OVN-Kubernetes:

* Egress IP addresses
* Egress firewalls
* Multicast

For more information about how the migration to OVN-Kubernetes works, see xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/migrate-from-openshift-sdn.adoc#migrate-from-openshift-sdn[Migrating from the OpenShift SDN cluster network provider].

[id="ocp-4-12-egress-firewall-audit-logging"]
==== Egress firewall audit logging

For the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, egress firewalls support audit logging using the same mechanism that network policy audit logging uses. For more information, see xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/logging-network-policy.adoc#logging-network-policy[Logging for egress firewall and network policy rules].

[id="ocp-4-12-announce-IP-from-node-subset-metallb"]
==== Advertise MetalLB from a given address pool from a subset of nodes
With this update, in BGP mode, you can use the node selector to advertise the MetalLB service from a subset of nodes, using a specific pool of IP addresses. This feature was introduced as a Technology Preview feature in {product-title} 4.11 and is now generally available in {product-title} 4.12 for BGP mode only. L2 mode remains a Technology Preview feature.

For more information, see xref:../networking/metallb/about-advertising-ipaddresspool.adoc#nw-metallb-advertise-ip-pools-to-node-subset_about-advertising-ip-address-pool[Advertising an IP address pool from a subset of nodes].

[id="ocp-4-12-ne-metallb-deployment-specs"]
==== Additional deployment specifications for MetalLB
This update provides additional deployment specifications for MetalLB. When you use a custom resource to deploy MetalLB, you can use these additional deployment specifications to manage how MetalLB `speaker` and `controller` pods deploy and run in your cluster. For example, you can use MetalLB deployment specifications to manage where MetalLB pods are deployed, define CPU limits for MetalLB pods, and assign runtime classes to MetalLB pods.

For more information about deployment specifications for MetalLB, see xref:../networking/metallb/metallb-operator-install.adoc#nw-metallb-operator-deployment-specifications-for-metallb_metallb-operator-install[Deployment specifications for MetalLB].

[id="overriding-default-node-ip-selection-logic"]
==== Node IP selection improvements

Previously, the `nodeip-configuration` service on a cluster host selected the IP address from the interface that the default route used. If multiple routes were present, the service would select the route with the lowest metric value. As a result, network traffic could be distributed from the incorrect interface.

With {product-title} 4.12, a new interface has been added to the `nodeip-configuration` service, which allows users to create a hint file. The hint file contains a variable, `NODEIP_HINT`, that overrides the default IP selection logic and selects a specific node IP address from the subnet `NODEIP_HINT` variable. Using the `NODEIP_HINT` variable allows users to specify which IP address is used, ensuring that network traffic is distributed from the correct interface.

For more information, see xref:../support/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-network-issues.adoc#overriding-default-node-ip-selection-logic_troubleshooting-network-issues[Optional: Overriding the default node IP selection logic].

[id="ocp-4-12-ne-coredns-bump"]
==== CoreDNS update to version 1.10.0

In {product-title} {product-version}, CoreDNS uses version 1.10.0, which includes the following changes:

* CoreDNS does not expand the query UDP buffer size if it was previously set to a smaller value.
* CoreDNS now always prefixes each log line in Kubernetes client logs with the associated log level.
* CoreDNS now reloads more quickly at an approximate speed of 20ms.

[id="ocp-4-12-ne-reload-interval"]
==== Support for a configurable reload interval in HAProxy

With this update, a cluster administrator can configure the reload interval to force HAProxy to reload its configuration less frequently in response to route and endpoint updates. The default minimum HAProxy reload interval is 5 seconds.

For more information, see xref:../post_installation_configuration/network-configuration.adoc#configuring-haproxy-interval_post-install-network-configuration[Configuring HAProxy reload interval].

[id="ocp-412-nw-network-observability-updates"]

[id="ocp-4-12-nw-api-ingress-ipv6-support"]
==== Support for IPv6 virtual IP (VIP) addresses for the Ingress VIP and API VIP services on bare metal

With this update, in installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters, the `ingressVIP` and `apiVIP` configuration settings in the `install-config.yaml` file are deprecated. Instead, use the `ingressVIPs` and `apiVIPs` configuration settings. These settings support dual-stack networking for applications on bare metal that require IPv4 and IPv6 access to the cluster by using the Ingress VIP and API VIP services. The `ingressVIPs` and `apiVIPs` configuration settings use a list format to specify an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, or both IP address formats. The order of the list indicates the primary and secondary VIP address for each service. The primary IP address must be from the IPv4 network when using dual stack networking.

=== Operator lifecycle

[id="ocp-4-12-platform-operators"]
==== Platform Operators (Technology Preview)

Starting in {product-title} 4.12, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) introduces the _platform Operator_ type as a Technology Preview feature. The platform Operator mechanism relies on resources from the RukPak component, also introduced in {product-title} 4.12, to source and manage content.

A platform Operator is an OLM-based Operator that can be installed during or after an {product-title} cluster's Day 0 operations and participates in the cluster's lifecycle. As a cluster administrator, you can use platform Operators to further customize your {product-title} installation to meet your requirements and use cases.

For more information about platform Operators, see xref:../operators/admin/olm-managing-po.adoc#olm-managing-po[Managing platform Operators]. For more information about RukPak and its resources, see xref:../operators/understanding/olm-packaging-format.adoc#olm-rukpak-about_olm-packaging-format[Operator Framework packaging format].

[id="ocp-4-12-olm-operator-node-affinity"]
==== Controlling where an Operator is installed

By default, when you install an Operator, {product-title} randomly installs the Operator pod to one of your worker nodes.

In {product-title} {product-version}, you can control where an Operator pod is installed by adding affinity constraints to the Operator’s `Subscription` object.

For more information, see xref:../operators/admin/olm-adding-operators-to-cluster.adoc#olm-overriding-operator-pod-affinity_olm-adding-operators-to-a-cluster[Controlling where an Operator is installed].

[id="ocp-4-12-olm-pod-security-label-synchronization"]
==== Pod security admission synchronization for user-created openshift-* namespaces

In {product-title} {product-version}, pod security admission synchronization is enabled by default if an Operator is installed in user-created namespaces that have an `openshift-` prefix. Synchronization is enabled after a cluster service version (CSV) is created in the namespace. The synchronized label inherits the permissions of the service accounts in the namespace.

For more information, see xref:../authentication/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission.adoc#security-context-constraints-psa-synchronization_understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission[Security context constraint synchronization with pod security standards].

[id="ocp-4-12-osdk"]
=== Operator development

[id="ocp-4-12-osdk-security-context-config"]
==== Configuring the security context of a catalog pod

You can configure the security context of a catalog pod by using the `--security-context-config` flag on the `run bundle` and `bundle-upgrade` subcommands. The flag enables seccomp profiles to comply with pod security admission. The flag accepts the values of `restricted` and `legacy`. If you do not specify a value, the seccomp profile defaults to `restricted`. If your catalog pod cannot run with restricted permissions, set the flag to `legacy`, as shown in the following example:

[source,terminal]
----
$ operator-sdk run bundle \
  --security-context-config=legacy
----

[id="ocp-4-12-osdk-bundle-validate-removed-kube-1-25-apis"]
==== Validating bundle manifests for APIs removed from Kubernetes 1.25

You can now check bundle manifests for deprecated APIs removed from Kubernetes 1.25 by using the Operator Framework suite of tests with the `bundle validate` subcommand.

For example:

[source,terminal]
----
$ operator-sdk bundle validate .<bundle_dir_or_image> \
  --select-optional suite=operatorframework \
  --optional-values=k8s-version=1.25
----

If your Operator requests permission to use any of the APIs removed from Kubernetes 1.25, the command displays a warning message.

If any of the API versions removed from Kubernetes 1.25 are included in your Operator's cluster service version (CSV), the command displays an error message.

See xref:../release_notes/ocp-4-12-release-notes.adoc#ocp-4-12-removed-kube-1-25-apis[Beta APIs removed from Kubernetes 1.25] and the xref:../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-cli-ref.adoc#osdk-cli-ref-bundle-validate[Operator SDK CLI reference] for more information.

=== Machine Config Operator

[id="ocp-4-12-machine-config-operator-layering"]
==== {op-system} image layering

{op-system-first} image layering allows you to add new images on top of the base {op-system} image. This layering does not modify the base {op-system} image. Instead, it creates a _custom layered image_ that includes all {op-system} functionality and adds additional functionality to specific nodes in the cluster.

Currently, {op-system} image layering allows you to work with Customer Experience and Engagement (CEE) to obtain and apply Hotfix packages on top of your {op-system} image, based on the link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2996001[Red Hat Hotfix policy]. It is planned for future releases that you can use {op-system} image layering to incorporate third-party software packages such as Libreswan or numactl.

For more information, see xref:../post_installation_configuration/coreos-layering.adoc#coreos-layering[{op-system} image layering].

[id="ocp-4-12-monitoring"]
=== Monitoring

The monitoring stack for this release includes the following new and modified features.

[id="ocp-4-12-monitoring-updates-to-monitoring-stack-compnents-and-dependencies"]
==== Updates to monitoring stack components and dependencies
This release includes the following version updates for monitoring stack components and dependencies:

* kube-state-metrics to 2.6.0
* node-exporter to 1.4.0
* prom-label-proxy to 0.5.0
* Prometheus to 2.39.1
* prometheus-adapter to 0.10.0
* prometheus-operator to 0.60.1
* Thanos to 0.28.1

[id="ocp-4-12-monitoring-changes-to-alerting-rules"]
==== Changes to alerting rules

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat does not guarantee backward compatibility for recording rules or alerting rules.
====

* *New*
** Added the `TelemeterClientFailures` alert, which triggers when a cluster tries and fails to submit Telemetry data at a certain rate over a period of time. The alert fires when the rate of failed requests reaches 20% of the total rate of requests within a 15-minute window.
* *Changed*
** The `KubeAggregatedAPIDown` alert now waits 900 seconds rather than 300 seconds before sending a notification.
** The `NodeClockNotSynchronising` and `NodeClockSkewDetected` alerts now only evaluate metrics from the `node-exporter` job.
** The `NodeRAIDDegraded` and `NodeRAIDDiskFailure` alerts now include a device label filter to match only the value returned by `mmcblk.p.+|nvme.+|sd.+|vd.+|xvd.+|dm-.+|dasd.+`.
** The `PrometheusHighQueryLoad` and `ThanosQueryOverload` alerts now also trigger when a high querying load exists on the query layer.

[id="ocp-4-12-monitoring-new-option-to-specify-pod-topology-spread-constraints-for-monitoring-components"]
==== New option to specify pod topology spread constraints for monitoring components
You can now use pod topology spread constraints to control how Prometheus, Thanos Ruler, and Alertmanager pods are spread across a network topology when {product-title} pods are deployed in multiple availability zones.

[id="ocp-4-12-monitoring-new-option-to-improve-data-consistency-for-prometheus-adapter"]
==== New option to improve data consistency for Prometheus Adapter
You can now configure an optional kubelet service monitor for Prometheus Adapter (PA) that improves data consistency across multiple autoscaling requests.
Enabling this service monitor eliminates the possibility that two queries sent at the same time to PA might yield different results because the underlying PromQL queries executed by PA might be on different Prometheus servers.

[id="ocp-4-12-monitoring-update-to-alertmanager-configuration-for-additional-secret-keys"]
==== Update to Alertmanager configuration for additional secret keys
With this release, if you configure an Alertmanager secret to hold additional keys and if the Alertmanager configuration references these keys as files (such as templates, TLS certificates, or tokens), your configuration settings must point to these keys by using an absolute path rather than a relative path.
These keys are available under the `/etc/alertmanager/config` directory.
In earlier releases of {product-title}, you could use relative paths in your configuration to point to these keys because the Alertmanager configuration file was located in the same directory as the keys.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are upgrading to {product-title} {product-version} and have specified relative paths for additional Alertmanager secret keys that are referenced as files, you must change these relative paths to absolute paths in your Alertmanager configuration.
Otherwise, alert receivers that use the files will fail to deliver notifications.
====

[id="new-network-observability"]
=== New Network Observability Operator
As an administrator, you can now install the Network Observability Operator to observe the network traffic for {product-title} cluster in the console. You can view and monitor the network traffic data in different graphical representations. The Network Observability Operator uses eBPF technology to create the network flows. The network flows are enriched with {product-title} information, and stored in Loki. You can use the network traffic information for detailed troubleshooting and analysis.

=== Scalability and performance

[id="ocp-4-12-rsp-workload-hints"]
==== Disabling realtime using workload hints removes Receive Packet Steering from the cluster
At the cluster level by default, a systemd service sets a Receive Packet Steering (RPS) mask for virtual network interfaces. The RPS mask routes interrupt requests from virtual network interfaces according to the list of reserved CPUs defined in the performance profile. At the container level, a `CRI-O` hook script also sets an RPS mask for all virtual network devices.

With this update, if you set `spec.workloadHints.realTime` in the performance profile to `False`, the system also disables both the systemd service and the `CRI-O` hook script which set the RPS mask. The system disables these RPS functions because RPS is typically relevant to use cases requiring low-latency, realtime workloads only.

To retain RPS functions even when you set `spec.workloadHints.realTime` to `False`, see the _RPS Settings_ section of the Red Hat Knowledgebase solution link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5532341[Performance addons operator advanced configuration].

For more information about configuring workload hints, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/cnf-low-latency-tuning.adoc#cnf-understanding-workload-hints_cnf-master[Understanding workload hints].

[id="ocp-4-12-tuned"]

[id="ocp-4-12-low-latency-tuning-features-options"]
==== Support for new kernel features and options
The low latency tuning has been updated to use the latest kernel features and options. The fix for link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2117780[2117780] introduced a new per-CPU `kthread`, `ktimers`. This thread must be pinned to the proper CPU cores. With this update, there is no functional change; the isolation of the workload is the same. For more information, see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102450[2102450].

[id="tuning-of-power-states"]
==== Power-saving configurations

In {product-title} {product-version}, by enabling C-states and OS-controlled P-states, you can use different power-saving configurations for critical and non-critical workloads.

[id="ocp-4-12-kmmo"]
==== Kernel module management Operator

The kernel module management (KMM) Operator replaces the Special Resource Operator (SRO).
KMM includes the following features for connected environments only:

* Hub and spoke support for edge deployments
* Pre-flight checks for upgrade support
* Secure boot kernel module signing
* Must gather logs to assist with troubleshooting
* Binary firmware deployment

[id="ocp-4-12-hub-and-spoke"]
==== Hub and spoke cluster support (Technology Preview)

For hub and spoke deployments in an environment that can access the internet, you can use the kernel module management (KMM) Operator deployed in the hub cluster to manage the deployment of the required kernel modules to one or more managed clusters.

[id="scalability-and-performance-talm-updates"]
==== {cgu-operator-first}

{cgu-operator-first} now provides more detailed status information and messages, and redesigned conditions.
You can use the `ClusterLabelSelector` field for greater flexibility in selecting clusters for update.
You can use timeout settings to determine what happens if an update fails for a cluster, for example, skipping the failing cluster and continuing to upgrade other clusters, or stopping policy remediation for all clusters.
For more information see xref:../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/cnf-talm-for-cluster-upgrades.adoc[Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager for cluster updates].

[id="scalability-and-performance-mount-namespace"]
==== Mount namespace encapsulation (Technology Preview)

Encapsulation is the process of moving all Kubernetes-specific mount points to an alternative namespace to reduce the visibility and performance impact of a large number of mount points in the default namespace. Previously, mount namespace encapsulation has been deployed transparently in {product-title} specifically for Distributed Units (DUs) installed using GitOps ZTP. In {product-title} v4.12, this functionality is now available as a configurable option.

A standard host operating system uses systemd to constantly scan all mount namespaces: both the standard Linux mounts and the numerous mounts that Kubernetes uses to operate. The current implementation of Kubelet and CRI-O both use the top-level namespace for all container and Kubelet mount points. Encapsulating these container-specific mount points in a private namespace reduces systemd overhead and enhances CPU performance. Encapsulation can also improve security, by storing Kubernetes-specific mount points in a location safe from inspection by unprivileged users.

For more information, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/optimization/optimizing-cpu-usage.adoc#optimizing-cpu-usage[Optimizing CPU usage with mount namespace encapsulation].

[id="ocp-4-12-ztp-sno-workload-partitioning"]
==== Changing the workload partitioning CPU set in {sno} clusters that are deployed with GitOps ZTP

You can configure the workload partitioning CPU set in {sno} clusters that you deploy with GitOps ZTP.
To do this, you specify cluster management CPU resources with the `cpuset` field of the `SiteConfig` custom resource (CR) and the `reserved` field of the group `PolicyGenTemplate` CR.
The value that you set for `cpuset` should match the value set in the cluster `PerformanceProfile` CR `.spec.cpu.reserved` field for workload partitioning.

For more information, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-reference-cluster-configuration-for-vdu.adoc#ztp-sno-du-enabling-workload-partitioning_sno-configure-for-vdu[Workload partitioning].

[id="ocp-4-12-ztp-hub-templates"]
==== RHACM hub template functions now available for use with GitOps ZTP

Hub template functions are now available for use with GitOps ZTP using {rh-rhacm-first} and {cgu-operator-first}.
Hub-side cluster templates reduce the need to create separate policies for many clusters with similiar configurations but with different values.
For more information, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-advanced-policy-config.adoc#ztp-using-hub-cluster-templates_ztp-advanced-policy-config[Using hub templates in PolicyGenTemplate CRs].

[id="ocp-4-12-ztp-argocd-managed-cluster-limits"]
==== ArgoCD managed cluster limits

{rh-rhacm} uses `SiteConfig` CRs to generate the Day 1 managed cluster installation CRs for ArgoCD. Each ArgoCD application can manage a maximum of 300 `SiteConfig` CRs.
For more information, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-preparing-the-hub-cluster.adoc#ztp-configuring-hub-cluster-with-argocd_ztp-preparing-the-hub-cluster[Configuring the hub cluster with ArgoCD].

[id="ocp-4-12-ztp-config-policy-eval-intervals"]
==== GitOps ZTP support for configuring policy compliance evaluation timeouts in PolicyGenTemplate CRs

In GitOps ZTP v4.11+, a default policy compliance evaluation timeout value is available for use in `PolicyGenTemplate` custom resources (CRs).
This value specifies how long the related `ConfigurationPolicy` CR can be in a state of policy compliance or non-compliance before {rh-rhacm} re-evaluates the applied cluster policies.

Optionally, you can now override the default evaluation intervals for all policies in `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs.

For more information, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-advanced-policy-config.adoc#ztp-configuring-pgt-compliance-eval-timeouts_ztp-advanced-policy-config[Configuring policy compliance evaluation timeouts for PolicyGenTemplate CRs].

[id="specifying-the-platform-type-for-managed-clusters"]
==== Specifying the platform type for managed clusters

The Assisted Installer currently supports the following {product-title} platforms:

* `BareMetal`
* `VSphere`
* `None`

{sno-caps} does not support `VSphere`.
[id="ztp-configuring-the-hub-cluster-to-use-unauthenticated-registries"]
==== Configuring the hub cluster to use unauthenticated registries

This release supports the use of unauthenticated registries when configuring the hub cluster.
Registries that do not require authentication are listed under `spec.unauthenticatedRegistries` in the `AgentServiceConfig` resource.
Any registry on this list is not required to have an entry in the pull secret used for the spoke cluster installation.
`assisted-service` validates the pull secret by making sure it contains the authentication information for every image registry used for installation.

For more information, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-preparing-the-hub-cluster.adoc#ztp-configuring-the-hub-cluster-to-use-unauthenticated-registries_ztp-preparing-the-hub-cluster[Configuring the hub cluster to use unauthenticated registries].

[id="ocp-4-12-0-ironic-agent-image-ztp"]
==== Ironic agent mirroring in disconnected GitOps ZTP installations

For disconnected installations using GitOps ZTP, if you are deploying {product-title} version 4.11 or earlier to a spoke cluster with converged flow enabled, you must mirror the default Ironic agent image to the local image repository. The default Ironic agent images are the following:

* AMD64 Ironic agent image: `quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev@sha256:d3f1d4d3cd5fbcf1b9249dd71d01be4b901d337fdc5f8f66569eb71df4d9d446`

* AArch64 Ironic agent image: `quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev@sha256:cb0edf19fffc17f542a7efae76939b1e9757dc75782d4727fb0aa77ed5809b43`

For more information about mirroring images, see xref:../installing/disconnected_install/installing-mirroring-installation-images.adoc#installation-mirror-repository_installing-mirroring-installation-images[Mirroring the OpenShift Container Platform image repository].

[id="configuring-kernel-arguments-for-the-Discovery-ISO-by-using-GitOps-ZTP"]
==== Configuring kernel arguments for the Discovery ISO by using GitOps ZTP
{product-title} now supports specifying kernel arguments for the Discovery ISO in GitOps ZTP deployments. In both manual and automated GitOps ZTP deployments, the Discovery ISO is part of the {product-title} installation process on managed bare-metal hosts. You can now edit the `InfraEnv` resource to specify kernel arguments for the Discovery ISO. This is useful for cluster installations with specific environmental requirements. For example, you can define the `rd.net.timeout.carrier` kernel argument to help configure the cluster for static networking.

For more information about how to specify kernel arguments, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-deploying-far-edge-sites.adoc#setting-managed-bare-metal-host-kernel-arguments_ztp-deploying-far-edge-sites[Configuring kernel arguments for the Discovery ISO by using GitOps ZTP] and xref:../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-manual-install.adoc#setting-managed-bare-metal-host-kernel-arguments_ztp-manual-install[Configuring kernel arguments for the Discovery ISO for manual installations by using GitOps ZTP].

[id="ocp-4-12-1-assisted-installer-api-mixed-arch-clusters"]
==== Deploy heterogeneous spoke clusters from a hub cluster

With this update, you can create {product-title} mixed-architecture clusters, also known as heterogeneous clusters, that feature hosts with both AMD64 and AArch64 CPU architectures. You can deploy a heterogeneous spoke cluster from a hub cluster managed by Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM). To create a heterogeneous spoke cluster, add an AArch64 worker node to a deployed AMD64 cluster.

To add an AArch64 worker node to a deployed AMD64 cluster, you can specify the AArch64 architecture, the multi-architecture release image, and the operating system required for the node by using an `InfraEnv` custom resource (CR). You can then provision the AArch64 worker node to the AMD64 cluster by using the {ai-full} API and the `InfraEnv` CR.

[id="ocp-4-12-ran-http-transport"]
==== HTTP transport replaces AMQP for PTP and bare-metal events (Technology Preview)

HTTP is now the default transport in the PTP and bare-metal events infrastructure.

[id="ocp-4-12-auth"]
=== Authentication and authorization

[id="ocp-4-12-rhosp-application-credentials"]
==== Application credentials on {rh-openstack}

You can now specify link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/16.1/html/users_and_identity_management_guide/application_credentials[application credentials] in the `clouds.yaml` files of clusters that run on {rh-openstack-first}. Application credentials are an alternative to embedding user account details in configuration files. As an example, see the following section of a `clouds.yaml` file that includes user account details:

[source,yaml]
----
clouds:
    openstack:
        auth:
            auth_url: https://127.0.0.1:13000
            password: thepassword
            project_domain_name: Default
            project_name: theprojectname
            user_domain_name: Default
            username: theusername
        region_name: regionOne
----

Compare that section to one that uses application credentials:

[source,yaml]
----
clouds:
    openstack:
        auth:
            auth_url: https://127.0.0.1:13000
            application_credential_id: '5dc185489adc4b0f854532e1af81ffe0'
            application_credential_secret: 'PDCTKans2bPBbaEqBLiT_IajG8e5J_nJB4kvQHjaAy6ufhod0Zl0NkNoBzjn_bWSYzk587ieIGSlT11c4pVehA'
        auth_type: "v3applicationcredential"
        region_name: regionOne
----

To use application credentials with your cluster as a {rh-openstack} administrator, create the credentials. Then, use them in a `clouds.yaml` file when you install a cluster. Alternatively, you can create the `clouds.yaml` file and rotate it into an existing cluster.

[id="ocp-4-12-hcp"]
=== Hosted control planes (Technology Preview)

[id="ocp-4-12-hcp-api"]
==== HyperShift API beta release now available

The default version for the `hypershift.openshift.io` API, which is the API for hosted control planes on {product-title}, is now v1beta1. Currently, for an existing cluster, the move from alpha to beta is not supported.

[id="ocp-4-12-hcp-versioning"]
==== Versioning for hosted control planes

With each major, minor, or patch version release of {product-title}, the HyperShift Operator is released. The HyperShift command-line interface (CLI) is released as part of each HyperShift Operator release.

The `HostedCluster` and `NodePool` API resources are available in the beta version of the API and follow a similar policy to xref:../rest_api/understanding-api-support-tiers.adoc[{product-title}] and link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/[Kubernetes].

[id="ocp-4-12-hcp-etcd-backup"]
==== Backing up and restoring etcd on a hosted cluster

If you use hosted control planes on {product-title}, you can back up and restore etcd by taking a snapshot of etcd and uploading it to a location where you can retrieve it later, such as an S3 bucket. Later, if needed, you can restore the snapshot. For more information, see xref:../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/etcd-backup-restore-hosted-cluster.adoc[Backing up and restoring etcd on a hosted cluster].

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-12-psa-restricted-enforcement"]
=== Future restricted enforcement for pod security admission

Currently, pod security violations are shown as warnings and logged in the audit logs, but do not cause the pod to be rejected.

Global restricted enforcement for pod security admission is currently planned for the next minor release of {product-title}. When this restricted enforcement is enabled, pods with pod security violations will be rejected.

To prepare for this upcoming change, ensure that your workloads match the pod security admission profile that applies to them. Workloads that are not configured according to the enforced security standards defined globally or at the namespace level will be rejected. The `restricted-v2` SCC admits workloads according to the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#restricted[Restricted] Kubernetes definition.

If you are receiving pod security violations, see the following resources:

* See xref:../authentication/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission.adoc#security-context-constraints-psa-alert-eval_understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission[Identifying pod security violations] for information about how to find which workloads are causing pod security violations.

* See xref:../authentication/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission.adoc#security-context-constraints-psa-synchronization_understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission[Security context constraint synchronization with pod security standards] to understand when pod security admission label synchronization is performed. Pod security admission labels are not synchronized in certain situations, such as the following situations:
** The workload is running in a system-created namespace that is prefixed with `openshift-`.
** The workload is running on a pod that was created directly without a pod controller.

* If necessary, you can set a custom admission profile on the namespace or pod by setting the `pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce` label.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-12-olm-catalogs-and-psa-restricted-enforcement"]
=== Catalog sources and restricted pod security admission enforcement

Catalog sources built using the SQLite-based catalog format and a version of the `opm` CLI tool released before {product-title} 4.11 cannot run under restricted pod security enforcement.

In {product-title} {product-version}, namespaces do not have restricted pod security enforcement by default and the default catalog source security mode is set to `legacy`.

If you do not want to run your SQLite-based catalog source pods under restricted pod security enforcement, you do not need to update your catalog source in {product-title} {product-version}. However, to ensure your catalog sources run in future {product-title} releases, you must update your catalog sources to run under restricted pod security enforcement.

As a catalog author, you can enable compatibility with restricted pod security enforcement by completing either of the following actions:

* Migrate your catalog to the file-based catalog format.
* Update your catalog image with a version of the `opm` CLI tool released with {product-title} 4.11 or later.

If you do not want to update your SQLite database catalog image or migrate your catalog to the file-based catalog format, you can configure your catalog to run with elevated permissions.

[id="ocp-4-12-openshiftsdn-sno-not-supported"]
==== Support for deploying {sno} with OpenShiftSDN has been removed

Support for deploying {sno} clusters with OpenShiftSDN has been removed with this release. OVN-Kubernetes is the default networking solution for {sno} deployments.

==== Removal of Jenkins images from install payload

* {product-title} 4.11 moves the "OpenShift Jenkins" and "OpenShift Agent Base" images to the `ocp-tools-4` repository at `registry.redhat.io` so that Red Hat can produce and update the images outside the {product-title} lifecycle. Previously, these images were in the {product-title} install payload and the `openshift4` repository at `registry.redhat.io`. For more information, see xref:../cicd/jenkins/important-changes-to-openshift-jenkins-images.adoc#openshift-jenkins[OpenShift Jenkins].

* {product-title} 4.11 removes "OpenShift Jenkins Maven" and "NodeJS Agent" images from its payload. Previously, {product-title} 4.10 deprecated these images. Red Hat no longer produces these images, and they are not available from the `ocp-tools-4` repository at `registry.redhat.io`.
+
However, upgrading to {product-title} 4.11 does not remove "OpenShift Jenkins Maven" and "NodeJS Agent" images from 4.10 and earlier releases. And Red Hat provides bug fixes and support for these images through the end of the 4.10 release lifecycle, in accordance with the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} lifecycle policy].

[id="ocp-4-12-api-auth-bug-fixes"]
==== API Server and Authentication

* Previously, the Cluster Authentication Operator state was set to `progressing = false` after receiving a `workloadIsBeingUpdatedTooLong` error. At the same time, `degraded = false` was kept for the time of the `inertia` defined. Consequently, the shortened amount of progressing and increased time of degradedation would create a situation where `progressing = false` and `degraded = false` were set prematurely. This caused inconsistent OpenShift CI tests because a healthy state was assumed, which was incorrect. This issue has been fixed by removing the `progressing = false` setting after the `workloadIsBeingUpdatedTooLong` error is returned. Now, because there is no `progressing = false` state, OpenShift CI tests are more consistent. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2111842[*BZ#2111842*])

[id="ocp-4-12-bare-metal-hardware-bug-fixes"]
==== Bare Metal Hardware Provisioning

* In recent versions of server firmware the time between server operations has increased. This causes timeouts during installer-provisioned infrastructure installations when the {product-title} installation program waits for a response from the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC). The new `python3-sushy` release increases the number of server side attempts to contact the BMC. This update accounts for the extended waiting time and avoids timeouts during installation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4097[*OCPBUGS-4097*])

* Before this update, the Ironic provisioning service did not support Baseboard Management Controllers (BMC) that use weak eTags combined with strict eTag validation. By design, if the BMC provides a weak eTag, Ironic returns two eTags: the original eTag and the original eTag converted to the strong format for compatibility with BMC that do not support weak eTags. Although Ironic can send two eTags, BMC using strict eTag validation rejects such requests due to the presence of the second eTag. As a result, on some older server hardware, bare-metal provisioning failed with the following error: `HTTP 412 Precondition Failed`. In {product-title} 4.12 and later, this behavior changes and Ironic no longer attempts to send two eTags in cases where a weak eTag is provided. Instead, if a Redfish request dependent on an eTag fails with an eTag validation error, Ironic retries the request with known workarounds. This minimizes the risk of bare-metal provisioning failures on machines with strict eTag validation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3479[*OCPBUGS-3479*])

* Before this update, when a Redfish system features a Settings URI, the Ironic provisioning service always attempts to use this URI to make changes to boot-related BIOS settings. However, bare-metal provisioning fails if the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) features a Settings URI but does not support changing a particular BIOS setting by using this Settings URI. In {product-title} 4.12 and later, if a system features a Settings URI, Ironic verifies that it can change a particular BIOS setting by using the Settings URI before proceeding. Otherwise, Ironic implements the change by using the System URI. This additional logic ensures that Ironic can apply boot-related BIOS setting changes and bare-metal provisioning can succeed.

==== Builds

* By default, Buildah prints steps to the log file, including the contents of environment variables, which might include xref:../cicd/builds/creating-build-inputs.adoc#builds-input-secrets-configmaps_creating-build-inputs[build input secrets]. Although you can use the `--quiet` build argument to suppress printing of those environment variables, this argument isn't available if you use the source-to-image (S2I) build strategy. The current release fixes this issue. To suppress printing of environment variables, set the `BUILDAH_QUIET` environment variable in your build configuration:

[id="ocp-4-12-cloud-compute-bug-fixes"]
==== Cloud Compute

* Previously, instances were not set to respect the GCP infrastructure default option for automated restarts. As a result, instances could be created without using the infrastructure default for automatic restarts. This sometimes meant that instances were terminated in GCP but their associated machines were still listed in the `Running` state because they did not automatically restart. With this release, the code for passing the automatic restart option has been improved to better detect and pass on the default option selection from users. Instances now use the infrastructure default properly and are automatically restarted when the user requests the default functionality. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4504[*OCPBUGS-4504*])

* The `v1beta1` version of the `PodDisruptionBudget` object is now deprecated in Kubernetes. With this release, internal references to `v1beta1` are replaced with `v1`. This change is internal to the cluster autoscaler and does not require user action beyond the advice in the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6955381[Preparing to upgrade to OpenShift Container Platform 4.12] Red Hat Knowledgebase Article. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1484[*OCPBUGS-1484*])

* Previously, the GCP machine controller reconciled the state of machines every 10 hours. Other providers set this value to 10 minutes so that changes that happen outside of the Machine API system are detected within a short period. The longer reconciliation period for GCP could cause unexpected issues such as missing certificate signing requests (CSR) approvals due to an external IP address being added but not detected for an extended period. With this release, the GCP machine controller is updated to reconcile every 10 minutes to be consistent with other platforms and so that external changes are picked up sooner. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4499[*OCPBUGS-4499*])

* Previously, due to a deployment misconfiguration for the Cluster Machine Approver Operator, enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set caused errors and sporadic Operator degradation. Because clusters with the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set enabled use two instances of the Cluster Machine Approver Operator and both deployments used the same set of ports, there was a conflict that lead to errors for single-node topology. With this release, the Cluster Machine Approver Operator deployment is updated to use a different set of ports for different deployments. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2621[*OCPBUGS-2621*])

* Previously, the scale from zero functionality in Azure relied on a statically compiled list of instance types mapping the name of the instance type to the number of CPUs and the amount of memory allocated to the instance type. This list grew stale over time. With this release, information about instance type sizes is dynamically gathered from the Azure API directly to prevent the list from becoming stale. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2558[*OCPBUGS-2558*])

* Previously, Machine API termination handler pods did not start on spot instances. As a result, pods that were running on tainted spot instances did not receive a termination signal if the instance was terminated. This could result in loss of data in workload applications. With this release, the Machine API termination handler deployment is modified to tolerate the taints and pods running on spot instances with taints now receive termination signals.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1274[*OCPBUGS-1274*])

* Previously, error messages for Azure clusters did not explain that it is not possible to create new machines with public IP addresses for a disconnected install that uses only the internal publish strategy. With this release, the error message is updated for improved clarity. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-519[*OCPBUGS-519*])

* Previously, the Cloud Controller Manager Operator did not check the `cloud-config` configuration file for AWS clusters. As a result, it was not possible to pass additional settings to the AWS cloud controller manager component by using the configuration file. With this release, the Cloud Controller Manager Operator checks the infrastructure resource and parses references to the `cloud-config` configuration file so that users can configure additional settings. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2104373[*BZ#2104373*])

* Previously, when Azure added new instance types and enabled accelerated networking support on instance types that previously did not have it, the list of Azure instances in the machine controller became outdated. As a result, the machine controller could not create machines with instance types that did not previously support accelerated networking, even if they support this feature on Azure. With this release, the required instance type information is retrieved from Azure API before the machine is created to keep it up to date so the machine controller is able to create machines with new and updated instance types. This fix also applies to any instance types that are added in the future. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2108647[*BZ#2108647*])

* Previously, the cluster autoscaler did not respect the AWS, IBM Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud topology labels for the CSI drivers when using the Cluster API provider. As a result, nodes with the topology label were not processed properly by the autoscaler when attempting to balance nodes during a scale-out event. With this release, the autoscaler's custom processors are updated so that it respects this label. The autoscaler can now balance similar node groups that are labeled by the AWS, IBM Cloud, or Alibaba CSI labels. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2001027[*BZ#2001027*])

* Previously, Power VS cloud providers were not capable of fetching the machine IP address from a DHCP server. Changing the IP address did not update the node, which caused some inconsistencies, such as pending certificate signing requests. With this release, the Power VS cloud provider is updated to fetch the machine IP address from the DHCP server so that the IP addresses for the nodes are consistent with the machine IP address. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2111474[*BZ#2111474*])

* Previously, machines created in early versions of {product-title} with invalid configurations could not be deleted. With this release, the webhooks that prevent the creation of machines with invalid configurations no longer prevent the deletion of existing invalid machines. Users can now successfully remove these machines from their cluster by manually removing the finalizers on these machines. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2101736[*BZ#2101736*])

* Previously, short DHCP lease times, caused by `NetworkManager` not being run as a daemon or in continuous mode, caused machines to become stuck during initial provisioning and never become nodes in the cluster. With this release, extra checks are added so that if a machine becomes stuck in this state it is deleted and recreated automatically. Machines that are affected by this network condition can become nodes after a reboot from the Machine API controller. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2115090[*BZ#2115090*])

* Previously, when creating a new `Machine` resource using a machine profile that does not exist in IBM Cloud, the machines became stuck in the `Provisioning` phase. With this release, validation is added to the IBM Cloud Machine API provider to ensure that a machine profile exists, and machines with an invalid machine profile are rejected by the Machine API. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2062579[*BZ#2062579*])

* Previously, the Machine API provider for AWS did not verify that the security group defined in the machine specification exists. Instead of returning an error in this case, it used a default security group, which should not be used for {product-title} machines, and successfully created a machine without informing the user that the default group was used. With this release, the Machine API returns an error when users set either incorrect or empty security group names in the machine specification. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2060068[*BZ#2060068*])

* Previously, the Machine API provider Azure did not treated user-provided values for instance types as case sensitive. This led to false-positive errors when instance types were correct but did not match the case. With this release, instance types are converted to the lowercase characters so that users get correct results without false-positive errors for mismatched case. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2085390[*BZ#2085390*])

* Previously, there was no check for nil values in the annotations of a machine object before attempting to access the object. This situation was rare, but caused the machine controller to panic when reconciling the machine. With this release, nil values are checked and the machine controller is able to reconcile machines without annotations. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2106733[*BZ#2106733*])

* Previously, the cluster autoscaler metrics for cluster CPU and memory usage would never reach, or exceed, the limits set by the `ClusterAutoscaler` resource. As a result, no alerts were fired when the cluster autoscaler could not scale due to resource limitations. With this release, a new metric called `cluster_autoscaler_skipped_scale_events_count` is added to the cluster autoscaler to more accurately detect when resource limits are reached or exceeded. Alerts will now fire when the cluster autoscaler is unable to scale the cluster up because it has reached the cluster resource limits. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1997396[*BZ#1997396*])

* Previously, when the Machine API provider failed to fetch the machine IP address, it would not set the internal DNS name and the machine certificate signing requests were not automatically approved. With this release, the Power VS machine provider is updated to set the server name as the internal DNS name even when it fails to fetch the IP address. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2111467[*BZ#2111467*])

* Previously, the Machine API vSphere machine controller set the `PowerOn` flag when cloning a VM. This created a `PowerOn` task that the machine controller was not aware of. If that `PowerOn` task failed, machines were stuck in the `Provisioned` phase but never powered on. With this release, the cloning sequence is altered to avoid the issue. Additionally, the machine controller now retries powering on the VM in case of failure and reports failures properly. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2087981[*BZ#2087981*], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-954[*OCPBUGS-954*])

* With this release, AWS security groups are tagged immediately instead of after creation. This means that fewer requests are sent to AWS and the required user privileges are lowered. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2098054[*BZ#2098054*], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3094[*OCPBUGS-3094*])

* Previously, a bug in the {rh-openstack} legacy cloud provider resulted in a crash if certain {rh-openstack} operations were attempted after authentication had failed. For example, shutting down a server causes the Kubernetes controller manager to fetch server information from {rh-openstack}, which triggered this bug. As a result, if initial cloud authentication failed or was configured incorrectly, shutting down a server caused the Kubernetes controller manager to crash. With this release, the {rh-openstack} legacy cloud provider is updated to not attempt any {rh-openstack} API calls if it has not previously authenticated successfully. Now, shutting down a server with invalid cloud credentials no longer causes Kubernetes controller manager to crash. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102383[*BZ#2102383*])

[id="ocp-4-12-dev-console-bug-fixes"]
==== Developer Console

* Previously, the `openshift-config` namespace was hard coded for the `HelmChartRepository` custom resource, which was the same namespace for the `ProjectHelmChartRepository` custom resource. This prevented users from adding private `ProjectHelmChartRepository` custom resources in their desired namespace. Consequently, users were unable to access secrets and configmaps in the `openshift-config` namespace. This update fixes the `ProjectHelmChartRepository` custom resource definition with a `namespace` field that can read the secret and configmaps from a namespace of choice by a user with the correct permissions. Additionally, the user can add secrets and configmaps to the accessible namespace, and they can add private Helm chart repositories in the namespace used the creation resources.

[id="ocp-4-12-image-registry-bug-fixes"]
==== Image Registry

* Previously, the image trigger controller did not have permissions to change objects. Consequently, image trigger annotations did not work on some resources. This update creates a cluster role binding that provides the controller the required permissions to update objects according to annotations. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2055620[*BZ#2055620*])

* Previously, the Image Registry Operator did not have a `progressing` condition for the `node-ca` daemon set and used `generation` from an incorrect object. Consequently, the `node-ca` daemon set could be marked as `degraded` while the Operator was still running. This update adds the `progressing` condition, which indicates that the installation is not complete. As a result, the Image Registry Operator successfully installs the `node-ca` daemon set, and the installer waits until it is fully deployed.

[id="ocp-4-12-installer-bug-fixes"]
==== Installer

* Previously, the number of supported user-defined tags was 8, and reserved {product-title} tags were 2 for AWS resources. With this release, the number of supported user-defined tags is now 25 and reserved {product-title} tags are 25 for AWS resources. You can now add up to 25 user tags during installation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CFE-592[*CFE#592*])

* Previously, installing a cluster on Amazon Web Services started and then failed when the IAM administrative user was not assigned the `s3:GetBucketPolicy` permission. This update adds this policy to checklist that the installation program uses to ensure that all of the required permissions are assigned. As a result, the installation program now stops the installation with a warning that the IAM administrative user is missing the `s3:GetBucketPolicy` permission. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2109388[*BZ#2109388*])

* Previously, installing a cluster on Microsoft Azure failed when the Azure DCasv5-series or DCadsv5-series of confidential VMs were specified as control plane nodes. With this update, the installation program now stops the installation with an error, which states that confidential VMs are not yet supported. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2055247[*BZ#2055247*])

* Previously, gathering bootstrap logs was not possible until the control plane machines were running. With this update, gathering bootstrap logs now only requires that the bootstrap machine be available. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2105341[*BZ#2105341*])

* Previously, if a cluster failed to install on Google Cloud Platform because the service account had insufficient permissions, the resulting error message did not mention this as the cause of the failure. This update improves the error message, which now instructs users to check the permissions that are assigned to the service account. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2103236[*BZ#2103236*])

* Previously, when an installation on Google Cloud provider (GCP) failed because an invalid GCP region was specified, the resulting error message did not mention this as the cause of the failure. This update improves the error message, which now states the region is not valid. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102324[*BZ#2102324*])

* Previously, cluster installations using Hive could fail if Hive used an older version of the install-config.yaml file. This update allows the installation program to accept older versions of the `install-config.yaml` file provided by Hive. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2098299[*BZ#2098299*])

* Previously, the installation program would incorrectly allow the `apiVIP` and `ingressVIP` parameters to use the same IPv6 address if they represented the address differently, such as listing the address in an abbreviated format. In this update, the installer correctly validates these two parameters regardless of their formatting, requiring separate IP addresses for each parameter. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2103144[*BZ#2103144*])

* Previously, uninstalling a cluster using the installation program failed to delete all resources in clusters installed on GCP if the cluster name was more than 22 characters long. In this update, uninstalling a cluster using the installation program correctly locates and deletes all GCP cluster resources in cases of long cluster names. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2076646[*BZ#2076646*])

* Previously, when installing a cluster on {rh-openstack-first} with multiple networks defined in the `machineNetwork` parameter, the installation program only created security group rules for the first network. With this update, the installation program creates security group rules for all networks defined in the `machineNetwork` so that users no longer need to manually edit security group rules after installation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2095323[*BZ#2095323*])

* Previously, users could manually set the API and Ingress virtual IP addresses to values that conflicted with the allocation pool of the DHCP server when installing a cluster on OpenStack. This could cause the DHCP server to assign one of the VIP addresses to a new machine, which would fail to start. In this update, the installation program validates the user-provided VIP addresses to ensure that they do not conflict with any DHCP pools. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1944365[*BZ#1944365*])

* Previously, when installing a cluster on vSphere using a datacenter that is embedded inside a folder, the installation program could not locate the datacenter object, causing the installation to fail. In this update, the installation program can traverse the directory that contains the datacenter object, allowing the installation to succeed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2097691[*BZ#2097691*])

* Previously, when installing a cluster on Azure using arm64 architecture with installer-provisioned infrastructure, the image definition resource for `hyperVGeneration` V1 incorrectly had an architecture value of `x64`. With this update, the image definition resource for `hyperVGeneration` V1 has the correct architecture value of `Arm64`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3639[*OCPBUGS-3639*])

* Previously, when installing a cluster on VMware vSphere, the installation could fail if the user specified a user-defined folder in the `failureDomain` section of the `install-config.yaml` file. With this update, the installation program correctly validates user-defined folders in the `failureDomain` section of the `install-config.yaml` file. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3343[*OCPBUGS-3343*])

* Previously, when destroying a partially deployed cluster after an installation failed on VMware vSphere, some virtual machine folders were not destroyed. This error could occur in clusters configured with multiple vSphere datacenters or multiple vSphere clusters. With this update, all installer-provisioned infrastructure is correctly deleted when destroying a partially deployed cluster after an installation failure. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1489[*OCPBUGS-1489*])

* Previously, when installing a cluster on VMware vSphere, the installation failed if the user specified the `platform.vsphere.vcenters` parameter but did not specify the `platform.vsphere.failureDomains.topology.networks` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` file. With this update, the installation program alerts the user that the `platform.vsphere.failureDomains.topology.networks` field is required when specifying `platform.vsphere.vcenters`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1698[*OCPBUGS-1698*])

* Previously, when installing a cluster on VMware vSphere, the installation failed if the user defined the `platform.vsphere.vcenters` and `platform.vsphere.failureDomains` parameters but did not define `platform.vsphere.defaultMachinePlatform.zones`, or `compute.platform.vsphere.zones` and `controlPlane.platform.vsphere.zones`. With this update, the installation program validates that the user has defined the `zones` parameter in multi-region or multi-zone deployments prior to installation.

==== Kubernetes Controller Manager

* Previously, the Kubernetes Controller Manager Operator reported `degraded` on environments without a monitoring stack presence. With this update, the Kubernetes Controller Manager Operator skips checking the monitoring for cues about degradation when the monitoring stack is not present. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2118286[*BZ#2118286*])

* With this update, Kubernetes Controller Manager alerts (`KubeControllerManagerDown`, `PodDisruptionBudgetAtLimit`, `PodDisruptionBudgetLimit`, and `GarbageCollectorSyncFailed`) have links to Github  runbooks. The runbooks help users to understand debug these alerts. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2001409[*BZ#2001409*])

[id="ocp-4-12-kube-scheduler-bug-fixes"]
==== Kubernetes Scheduler

* Previously, the secondary scheduler deployment was not deleted after a secondary scheduler custom resource was deleted. Consequently, the Secondary Schedule Operator and Operand were not fully uninstalled. With this update, the correct owner reference is set in the secondary scheduler custom resource so that it points to the secondary scheduler deployment. As a result, secondary scheduler deployments are deleted when the secondary scheduler custom resource is deleted. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2100923[*BZ#2100923*])

* For the {product-title} {product-version} release, the descheduler can now publish events to an API group because the release adds additional role-based access controls (RBAC) rules to the descheduler's profile.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2330[*OCPBUGS-2330*])

[id="ocp-4-12-machine-config-operator-bug-fixes"]
==== Machine Config Operator

* Previously, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) `ControllerConfig` resource, which contains important certificates, was only synced if the Operator's daemon sync succeeded. By design, unready nodes during a daemon sync prevent that daemon sync from succeeding, so unready nodes were indirectly preventing the `ControllerConfig` resource, and therefore those certificates, from syncing. This resulted in eventual cluster degradation when there were unready nodes due to inability to rotate the certificates contained in the `ControllerConfig` resource. With this release, the sync of the `ControllerConfig` resource is no longer dependent on the daemon sync succeeding, so the `ControllerConfig` resource now continues to sync if the daemon sync fails. This means that unready nodes no longer prevent the `ControllerConfig` resource from syncing, so certificates continue to be updated even when there are unready nodes.

[id="ocp-4-12-management-console-bug-fixes"]
==== Management Console

* Previously, the *Operator details* page attempted to display multiple error messages, but the error message component can only display a single error message at a time. As a result, relevant error messages were not displayed. With this update, the *Operator details* page displays only the first error message so the user sees a relevant error. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3927[*OCPBUGS-3927*])

* Previously, the product name for Azure Red Hat OpenShift was incorrect in Customer Case Management (CCM). As a result, the console had to use the same incorrect product name to correctly populate the fields in CCM. Once the product name in CCM was updated, the console needed to be updated as well. With this update, the same, correct product name as CCM is correctly populated with the correct Azure product name when following the link from the console. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-869[*OCPBUGS-869*])

* Previously, when a plugin page resulted in an error, the error did not reset when navigating away from the error page, and the error persisted after navigating to a page that was not the cause of the error. With this update, the error state is reset to its default when a user navigates to a new page, and the error no longer persists after navigating to a new page. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2117738[*BZ#2117738*], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-523[*OCPBUGS-523*])

* Previously, the *_View it here_* link in the *Operator details* pane for installed Operators was incorrectly built when *_All Namespaces_* was selected. As a result, the link attempted to navigate to the *Operator details* page for a cluster service version (CSV) in *All Projects*, which is an invalid route. With this update, the *_View it here_* link to use the namespace where the CSV is installed now builds correctly and the link works as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-184[*OCPBUGS-184*])

* Previously, line numbers with more than five digits resulted in a cosmetic issue where the line number overlaid the vertical divider between the line number and the line contents making it harder to read. With this update, the amount of space available for line numbers was increased to account for longer line numbers, and the line number no longer overlays the vertical divider. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-183[*OCPBUGS-183*])

* Previously, in the administrator perspective of the web console, the link to *_Learn more about the OpenShift local update services_* on the *Default update server* pop-up window in the *Cluster Settings* page produced a 404 error. With this update, the link works as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2098234[*BZ#2098234*])

* Previously, the `MatchExpression` component did not account for array-type values. As a result,  only single values could be entered through forms using this component. With this update, the `MatchExpression` component accepts comma-separated values as an array. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2079690[*BZ#207690*])

* Previously, there were redundant checks for the model resulting in tab reloading which occasionally resulted in a flickering of the tab contents where they rerendered. With this update, the redundant model check was removed, and the model is only checked once. As a result, the tab contents do not flicker and no longer rerender. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2037329[*BZ#2037329*])

* Previously, when selecting the `edit` label from the action list on the OpenShift Dedicated node page, no response was elicited and a web hook error was returned. This issue has been fixed so that the error message is only returned when editing fails. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102098[*BZ#2102098*])

* Previously, if issues were pending, clicking on the *Insights* link would crash the page. As a workaround, you can wait for the variable to become `initialized` before clicking the *Insights* link. As a result, the Insights page will open as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2052662[*BZ#2052662*])

* Previously, when the `MachineConfigPool` resource was paused, the option to unpause said *Resume rollouts*. The wording has been updated so that it now says *Resume updates*. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2094240[*BZ#2094240*])

* Previously, the wrong calculating method was used when counting master and worker nodes. With this update, the correct worker nodes are calculated when nodes have both the `master` and `worker` role. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1951901[*BZ#1951901*])

* Previously, conflicting `react-router` routes for `ImageManifestVuln` resulted in attempts to render a details page for `ImageManifestVuln` with a `~new` name. Now, the container security plugin has been updated to remove conflicting routes and to ensure dynamic lists and details page extensions are used on the Operator details page. As a result, the console renders the correct create, list, and details pages for `ImageManifestVuln`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2080260[*BZ#2080260*])

* Previously, incomplete YAML was not synced was occasionally displayed to users. With this update, synced YAML always displays. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2084453[*BZ#2084453*])

* Previously, when installing an Operator that required a custom resource (CR) to be created for use, the *Create resource* button could fail to install the CR because it was pointing to the incorrect namespace. With this update, the *Create resource* button works as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2094502[*BZ#2094502*])

* Previously, the *Cluster update* modal was not displaying errors properly. As a result, the *Cluster update* modal did not display or explain errors when they occurred. With this update, the *Cluster update* modal correctly display errors. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2096350[*BZ#2096350*])

[id="ocp-4-12-monitoring-bug-fixes"]
==== Monitoring

* Before this update, cluster administrators could not distinguish between a pod being not ready because of a scheduling issue and a pod being not ready because it could not be started by the kubelet. In both cases, the `KubePodNotReady` alert would fire. With this update, the `KubePodNotScheduled` alert now fires when a pod is not ready because of a scheduling issue, and the `KubePodNotReady` alert fires when a pod is not ready because it could not be started by the kubelet. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4431[*OCPBUGS-4431*])

* Before this update, `node_exporter` would report metrics about virtual network interfaces such as `tun` interfaces, `br` interfaces, and `ovn-k8s-mp` interfaces. With this update, metrics for these virtual interfaces are no longer collected, which decreases monitoring resource consumption. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1321[*OCPBUGS-1321*])

* Before this update, Alertmanager pod startup might time out because of slow DNS resolution, and the Alertmanager pods would not start. With this release, the timeout value has been increased to seven minutes, which prevents pod startup from timing out. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2083226[*BZ#2083226*])

* Before this update, if Prometheus Operator failed to run or schedule Prometheus pods, the system provided no underlying reason for the failure. With this update, if Prometheus pods are not run or scheduled, the Cluster Monitoring Operator updates the `clusterOperator` monitoring status with a reason for the failure, which can be used to troubleshoot the underlying issue. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2043518[*BZ#2043518*])

* Before this update, if you created an alert silence from the *Developer* perspective in the {product-title} web console, external labels were included that did not match the alert. Therefore, the alert would not be silenced. With this update, external labels are now excluded when you create a silence in the *Developer* perspective so that newly created silences function as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2084504[*BZ#2084504*])

* Previously, if you enabled an instance of Alertmanager dedicated to user-defined projects, a misconfiguration could occur in certain circumstances, and you would not be informed that the user-defined project Alertmanager config map settings did not load for either the main instance of Alertmanager or the instance dedicated to user-defined projects. With this release, if this misconfiguration occurs, the Cluster Monitoring Operator now displays a message that informs you of the issue and provides resolution steps. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2099939[*BZ#2099939*])

* Before this update, if the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) failed to update Prometheus, the CMO did not verify whether a previous deployment was running and would report that cluster monitoring was unavailable even if one of the Prometheus pods was still running. With this update, the CMO now checks for running Prometheus pods in this situation and reports that cluster monitoring is unavailable only if no Prometheus pods are running. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2039411[*BZ#2039411*])

* Before this update, if you configured OpsGenie as an alert receiver, a warning would appear in the log that `api_key` and `api_key_file` are mutually exclusive and that `api_key` takes precedence. This warning appeared even if you had not defined `api_key_file`. With this update, this warning only appears in the log if you have defined both `api_key` and `api_key_file`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2093892[*BZ#2093892*])

* Before this update the Telemeter Client (TC) only loaded new pull secrets when it was manually restarted. Therefore, if a pull secret had been changed or updated and the TC had not been restarted, the TC would fail to authenticate with the server. This update addresses the issue so that when the secret is rotated, the deployment is automatically restarted and uses the updated token to authenticate.

[id="ocp-4-12-networking-bug-fixes"]
==== Networking

* Previously, routers that were in the terminating state delayed the `oc cp` command which would delay the `oc adm must-gather` command until the pod was terminated. With this update, a timeout for each issued `oc cp` command is set to prevent delaying the `must-gather` command from running. As a result, terminating pods no longer delay `must-gather` commands. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2103283[*BZ#2103283*])

* Previously, an Ingress Controller could not be configured with both the `Private` endpoint publishing strategy type and PROXY protocol. With this update, users can now configure an Ingress Controller with both the `Private` endpoint publishing strategy type and PROXY protocol. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2104481[*BZ#2104481*])

* Previously, the `routeSelector` parameter cleared the route status of the Ingress Controller prior to the router deployment. Because of this, the route status repopulated incorrectly. To avoid using stale data, route status detection has been updated to no longer rely on the Kubernetes object cache. Additionally, this update includes a fix to check the generation ID on route deployment to determine the route status. As a result, the route status is consistently cleared with a `routeSelector` update. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2101878[*BZ#2101878*])

* Previously, a cluster that was upgraded from a version of {product-title} earlier than 4.8 could have orphaned `Route` objects. This was caused by earlier versions of {product-title} translating `Ingress` objects into `Route` objects irrespective of a given `Ingress` object's indicated `IngressClass`. With this update, an alert is sent to the cluster administrator about any orphaned Route objects still present in the cluster after Ingress-to-Route translation. This update also adds another alert that notifies the cluster administrator about any Ingress objects that do not specify an `IngressClass`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1962502[*BZ#1962502*])

* Previously, if a `configmap` that the router deployment depends on is not created, then the router deployment does not progress. With this update, the cluster Operator reports `ingress progressing=true` if the default ingress controller deployment is progressing. This results in users debugging issues with the ingress controller by using the command `oc get co`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2066560[*BZ#2066560*])

* Previously, when an incorrectly created network policy was added to the OVN-Kubernetes cache, it would cause the OVN-Kubernetes leader to enter `crashloopbackoff` status. With this update, OVN-Kubernetes leader does not enter `crashloopbackoff` status by skipping deleting nil policies. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2091238[*BZ#2091238*])

* Previously, recreating an EgressIP pod with the same namespace or name within 60 seconds of deleting an older one with the same namespace or name causes the wrong SNAT to be configured. As a result, packets could go out with nodeIP instead of EgressIP SNAT. With this update, traffic leaves the pod with EgressIP instead of nodeIP. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2097243[*BZ#2097243*]).

* Previously, older Access Control Lists (ACL)s with `arp` produced  `unexpectedly found multiple equivalent ACLs (arp v/s arp||nd)` errors due to a change in the ACL from `arp` to `arp II nd`. This prevented network policies from being created properly. With this update, older ACLs with just the `arp` match have been removed so that only ACLs with the new `arp II nd` match exist so that network policies can be created correctly and no errors will be observed on `ovnkube-master`. NOTE: This effects customers upgrading into 4.8.14, 4.9.32, 4.10.13 or higher from older versions. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2095852[*BZ#2095852*]).

* With this update, CoreDNS has been updated to version 1.10.0, which is based on Kubernetes 1.25. This keeps both the CoreDNS version and {product-title} {product-version}, which is also based on Kubernetes 1.25, in alignment with one another. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1731[*OCPBUGS-1731*])

* With this update, the {product-title} router now uses `k8s.io/client-go` version 1.25.2, which supports Kubernetes 1.25. This keeps both the `openshift-router` and {product-title} {product-version}, which is also based on Kubernetes 1.25, in alignment with one another. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1730[*OCPBUGS-1730*])

* With this update, the Ingress Operator now uses `k8s.io/client-go` version 1.25.2, which supports Kubernetes 1.25. This keeps both the Ingress Operator and {product-title} {product-version}, which is also based on Kubernetes 1.25, in alignment with one another. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1554[*OCPBUGS-1554*])

* Previously, the DNS Operator did not reconcile the `openshift-dns` namespace. Because {product-title} {product-version} requires the `openshift-dns` namespace to have pod-security labels, this caused the namespace to be missing those labels upon cluster update. Without the pod-security labels, the pods failed to start. With this update, the DNS Operator now reconciles the `openshift-dns` namespace, and the pod-security labels are now present. As a result, pods start as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1549[*OCPBUGS-1549*])

* Previously, the `ingresscontroller.spec.tuniningOptions.reloadInterval` did not support decimal numerals as valid parameter values because the Ingress Operator internally converts the specified value into milliseconds, which was not a supported time unit. This prevented an Ingress Controller from being deleted. With this update, `ingresscontroller.spec.tuningOptions.reloadInterval` now supports decimal numerals and users can delete Ingress Controllers with `reloadInterval` parameter values which were previously unsupported. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-236[*OCPBUGS-236*])

* Previously, the Cluster DNS Operator used GO Kubernetes libraries that were based on Kubernetes 1.24 while {product-title} 4.12 is based on Kubernetes 1.25. With this update, GO Kubernetes API is v1.25.2, which aligns the Cluster DNS Operator with {product-title} 4.12 that uses Kubernetes 1.25 APIs. (link: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1558[*OCPBUGS-1558*])

* Previously, setting the `disableNetworkDiagnostics` configuration to `true` did not persist when the `network-operator` pod was re-created. With this update, the `disableNetworkDiagnostics` configuration property of network `operator.openshift.io/cluster` no longer resets to its default value after network operator restart. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-392[*OCPBUGS-392*])

* Previously, `ovn-kubernetes` did not configure the correct MAC address of bonded interfaces in `br-ex` bridge. As a result, a node that uses bonding for the primary Kubernetes interface fails to join the cluster. With this update, `ovn-kubernetes` configures the correct MAC address of bonded interfaces in `br-ex` bridge, and nodes that use bonding for the primary Kubernetes interface successfully join the cluster. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2096413[*BZ2096413*])

* Previously, when the Ingress Operator was configured to enable the use of mTLS, the Operator would not check if CRLs needed updating until some other event caused it to reconcile. As a result, CRLs used for mTLS could become out of date. With this update, the Ingress Operator now automatically reconciles when any CRL expires, and CRLs will be updated at the time specified by their `nextUpdate` field.

[id="ocp-4-12-openshift-cli-bug-fixes"]
==== OpenShift CLI (oc)

* The {product-title} {product-version} release fixes an issue with entering a debug session on a target node when the target namespace lacks the appropriate security level. This caused the `oc` CLI to prompt you with a pod security error message. If the existing namespace does not contain the appropriate security levels, {product-title} now creates a temporary namespace when you enter `oc` debug mode on a target node. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-852[OCPBUGS-852])

* Previously, on macOS arm64 architecture, the `oc` binary needed to be signed manually. As a result, the `oc` binary did not work as expected. This update implements a self-signing binary for `oc` mimicking. As a result, the `oc` binary on macOS arm64 architectures works properly. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2059125[*BZ#2059125*])

* Previously, `must-gather` was trying to collect resources that were not present on the server. Consequently, `must-gather` would print error messages. Now, before collecting resources, `must-gather` checks whether the resource exists. As a result, `must-gather` no longer prints an error when it fails to collect non-existing resources on the server. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2095708[*BZ#2095708*])

* The {product-title} {product-version} release updates the `oc-mirror` library, so that the library supports multi-arch platform images. This means that you can choose from a wider selection of architectures, such as `arm64`, when mirroring a platform release payload. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-617[*OCPBUGS-617*])

[id="ocp-4-12-olm-bug-fixes"]
==== Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

* Before the {product-title} {product-version} release, the `package-server-manager` controller would not revert any changes made to a `package-server` cluster service version (CSV), because of an issue with the `on-cluster` function. These persistent changes might impact how an Operator starts in a cluster. For {product-title} {product-version}, the `package-server-manager` controller always rebuilds a `package-server` CSV to its original state, so that no modifications to the CSV persist after a cluster upgrade operation. The `on-cluster` function no longer controls the state of a `package-server` CSV. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-867[*OCPBUGS-867*])

* Previously, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) would attempt to update namespaces to apply a label, even if the label was present on the namespace. Consequently, the update requests increased the workload in API and etcd services. With this update, OLM compares existing labels against the expected labels on a namespace before issuing an update. As a result, OLM no longer attempts to make unnecessary update requests on namespaces. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2105045[*BZ#2105045*])

* Previously, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) would prevent minor cluster upgrades that should not be blocked based on a miscalculation of the `ClusterVersion` custom resources's `spec.DesiredVersion` field. With this update, OLM no longer prevents cluster upgrades when the upgrade should be supported. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2097557[*BZ#2097557*])

* Previously, the reconciler would update a resource's annotation without making a copy of the resource. This caused an error that would terminate the reconciler process. With this update, the reconciler no longer stops due the error. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2105045[*BZ#2105045*])

* The `package-server-manifest` (PSM) is a controller that ensures that the correct `package-server` Cluster Service Version (CSV) is installed on a cluster. Previously, changes to the `package-server` CSV were not being reverted because of a logical error in the reconcile function in which an on-cluster object could influence the expected object. Users could modify the `package-server` CSV and the changes would not be reverted. Additionally, cluster upgrades would not update the YAML for the `package-server` CSV. With this update, the expected version of the CSV is now always built from scratch, which removes the ability for an on-cluster object to influence the expected values. As a result, the PSM now reverts any attempts to modify the `package-server` CSV, and cluster upgrades now deploy the expected `package-server` CSV. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-858[*OCPBUGS-858*])

* Previously, OLM would upgrade an Operator according to the Operator's CRD status. A CRD lists component references in an order defined by the group/version/kind (GVK) identifier. Operators that share the same components might cause the GVK to change the component listings for an Operator, and this can cause the OLM to require more system resources to continuously update the status of a CRD. With this update, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) now upgrades an Operator according to the Operator's component references. A change to the custom resource definition (CRD) status of an Operator does not impact the OLM Operator upgrade process.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3795[*OCPBUGS-3795*])

[id="ocp-4-12-openshift-operator-sdk-bug-fixes"]
==== Operator SDK

* With this update, you can now set the security context for the registry pod by including the `securityContext` configuration field in the pod specification. This will apply the security context for all containers in the pod. The `securityContext` field also defines the pod's privileges. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2091864[*BZ#2091864*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-12-file-integrity-operator-bug-fixes"]
==== File Integrity Operator

* Previously, the File Integrity Operator deployed templates using the `openshift-file-integrity` namespace in the permissions for the Operator. When the Operator attempted to create objects in the namespace, it would fail due to permission issues. With this release, the deployment resources used by OLM are updated to use the correct namespace, fixing the permission issues so that users can install and use the operator in non-default namespaces. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2104897[*BZ#2104897*])

* Previously, underlying dependencies of the File Integrity Operator changed how alerts and notifications were handled, and the Operator didn't send metrics as a result. With this release the Operator ensures that the metrics endpoint is correct and reachable on startup. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2115821[*BZ#2115821*])

* Previously, alerts issued by the File Integrity Operator did not set a namespace. This made it difficult to understand where the alert was coming from, or what component was responsible for issuing it. With this release, the Operator includes the namespace it was installed into in the alert, making it easier to narrow down what component needs attention. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2101393[*BZ#2101393*])

* Previously, the File Integrity Operator did not properly handle modifying alerts during an upgrade. As a result, alerts did not include the namespace in which the Operator was installed. With this release, the Operator includes the namespace it was installed into in the alert, making it easier to narrow down what component needs attention. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2112394[*BZ#2112394*])

* Previously, service account ownership for the File Integrity Operator regressed due to underlying OLM updates, and updates from 0.1.24 to 0.1.29 were broken. With this update, the Operator defaults to upgrading to 0.1.30. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2109153[*BZ#2109153*])

* Previously, the File Integrity Operator daemon used the `ClusterRoles` parameter instead of the `Roles` parameter for a recent permission change. As a result, OLM could not update the Operator. With this release, the Operator daemon reverts to using the `Roles` parameter and updates from older versions to version 0.1.29 are successful. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2108475[*BZ#2108475*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-12-compliance-operator-bug-fixes"]
==== Compliance Operator

* Previously, the Compliance Operator used an old version of the Operator SDK, which is a dependency for building Operators. This caused alerts about deprecated Kubernetes functionality used by the Operator SDK. With this release, the Compliance Operator is updated to version 0.1.55, which includes an updated version of the Operator SDK. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2098581[*BZ#2098581*])

* Previously, applying automatic remediation for the `rhcos4-high-master-sysctl-kernel-yama-ptrace-scope` and `rhcos4-sysctl-kernel-core-pattern` rules resulted in subsequent failures of those rules in scan results, even though they were remediated. The issue is fixed in this release. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2094382[*BZ#2094382*])

* Previously, the Compliance Operator hard coded notifications to the default namespace. As a result, notifications from the Operator would not appear if the Operator was installed in a different namespace. This issue is fixed in this release. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2060726[*BZ#2060726*])

* Previously, the Compliance Operator failed to fetch API resources when parsing machine configurations without Ignition specifications. This caused the `api-check-pods` check to crash loop. With this release, the Compliance Operator is updated to gracefully handle machine configuration pools without Ignition specifications. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2117268[*BZ#2117268*])

* Previously, the Compliance Operator held machine configurations in a stuck state because it could not determine the relationship between machine configurations and kubelet configurations. This was due to incorrect assumptions about machine configuration names. With this release, the Compliance Operator is able to determine if a kubelet configuration is a subset of a machine configuration. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102511[*BZ#2102511*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-12-openshift-api-server-bug-fixes"]
==== OpenShift API server

* Previously, adding a member could remove previous members from a group. As a result, the user lost group privileges. With this release, the dependencies were bumped and users no longer lose group privledges. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-533[*OCPBUGS-533*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-12-rhcos-bug-fixes"]
==== {op-system-first}

* Previously, updating to Podman 4.0 prevented users from using custom images with toolbox containers on {op-system}. This fix updates the toolbox library code to account for the new Podman behavior, so users can now use custom images with toolbox on {op-system} as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2048789[*BZ#2048789*])

* Previously, the `podman exec` command did not work well with nested containers. Users encountered this issue when accessing a node using the `oc debug` command and then running a container with the `toolbox` command. Because of this, users were unable to reuse toolboxes on {op-system}. This fix updates the toolbox library code to account for this behavior, so users can now reuse toolboxes on {op-system}. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1915537[*BZ#1915537*])

* With this update, running the `toolbox` command now checks for updates to the default image before launching the container. This improves security and provides users with the latest bug fixes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049591[*BZ#2049591*])

* Previously, updating to Podman 4.0 prevented users from running the `toolbox` command on {op-system}. This fix updates the toolbox library code to account for the new Podman behavior, so users can now run `toolbox` on {op-system} as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2093040[*BZ#2093040*])

* Previously, custom SELinux policy modules were not properly supported by `rpm-ostree`, so they were not updated along with the rest of the system upon update. This would surface as failures in unrelated components. Pending SELinux userspace improvements landing in a future {product-title} release, this update provides a workaround to {op-system} that will rebuild and reload the SELinux policy during boot as needed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-595[*OCPBUGS-595*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-12-scalability-and-performance-bug-fixes"]
==== Scalability and performance

* The tuned profile has been modified to assign the same priority as `ksoftirqd` and `rcuc` to the newly introduced per-CPU kthreads (`ktimers`) added in a recent Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) kernel patch. For more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3475[*OCPBUGS-3475*], link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2117780[*BZ#2117780*] and link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2122220[*BZ#2122220*].

* Previously, restarts of the `tuned` service caused improper reset of the `irqbalance` configuration, leading to IRQ operation being served again on the isolated CPUs, therefore violating the isolation guarantees. With this fix, the `irqbalance` service configuration is properly preserved across `tuned` service restarts (explicit or caused by bugs), therefore preserving the CPU isolation guarantees with respect to IRQ serving. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-585[*OCPBUGS-585*])

* Previously, when the tuned daemon was restarted out of order as part of the cluster Node Tuning Operator, the CPU affinity of interrupt handlers was reset and the tuning was compromised. With this fix, the `irqbalance` plugin in tuned is disabled, and {product-title} now relies on the logic and interaction between `CRI-O` and `irqbalance`.(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2105123[*BZ#2105123*])

* Previously, a low latency hook script executing for every new `veth` device took too long when the node was under load. The resultant accumulated delays during pod start events caused the rollout time for `kube-apiserver` to be slow and sometimes exceed the 5-minute rollout timeout. With this fix, the container start time should be shorter and within the 5-minute threshold. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2109965[*BZ#2109965*]).

* Previously, the `oslat` control thread was collocated with one of the test threads, which caused latency spikes in the measurements. With this fix, the `oslat` runner now reserves one CPU for the control thread, meaning the test uses one less CPU for running the busy threads. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2051443[*BZ#2051443*])

* Latency measurement tools, also known as `oslat`, `cyclictest`, and `hwlatdetect`, now run on completely isolated CPUs without the helper process running in the background that might cause latency spikes, therefore providing more accurate latency measurements. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2618[*OCPBUGS-2618*])

* Previously, although the reference `PolicyGenTemplate` for `group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml` includes two `StorageClass`  entries, the generated policy included only one. With this update, the generated policy now includes both policies. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049306[*BZ#2049306*]).

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-12-storage-bug-fixes"]
==== Storage

* Previously, checks for generic ephemeral volumes failed. With this update, checks for expandable volumes now include generic ephemeral volumes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2082773[*BZ#2082773*])

* Previously, if more than one secret was present for vSphere, the vSphere CSI Operator randomly picked a secret and sometimes caused the Operator to restart. With this update, a warning appears when there is more than one secret on the vCenter CSI Operator. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2108473[*BZ#2108473*])

* Previously, {product-title} detached a volume when a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver was not able to unmount the volume from a node. Detaching a volume without unmount is not allowed by CSI specifications and drivers could enter an `undocumented` state. With this update, CSI drivers are detached before unmounting only on unhealthy nodes preventing the `undocumented` state. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049306[*BZ#2049306*])

* Previously, there were missing annotations on the Manila CSI Driver Operator's VolumeSnapshotClass. Consequently, the Manila CSI snapshotter could not locate secrets, and could not create snapshots with the default VolumeSnapshotClass. This update fixes the issue so that secret names and namespaces are included in the default VolumeSnapshotClass. As a result, users can now create snapshots in the Manila CSI Driver Operator using the default VolumeSnapshotClass. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2057637[*BZ#2057637*])

* Users can now opt into using the experimental VHD feature on Azure File. To opt in, users must specify the `fstype` parameter in a storage class and enable it with `--enable-vhd=true`. If `fstype` is used and the feature is not set to `true`, the volumes will fail to provision.
+
To opt out of using the VHD feature, remove the `fstype` parameter from your storage class. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2080449[*BZ#2080449*])

* Previously, if more than one secret was present for vSphere, the vSphere CSI Operator randomly picked a secret and sometimes caused the Operator to restart. With this update, a warning appears when there is more than one secret on the vCenter CSI Operator. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2108473[*BZ#2108473*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-12-web-console-developer-perspective-bug-fixes"]
==== Web console (Developer perspective)

* Previously, the users could not deselect a Git secret in add and edit forms. As a result, the resources had to be recreated. This fix resolves the issue by adding the option to choose `No Secret` in the select secret option list. As a result, the users can easily select, deselect, or detach any attached secrets. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2089221[*BZ#2089221*])

* In {product-title} 4.9, when it is minimal or no data in the *Developer Perspective*, most of the monitoring charts or graphs (CPU consumption, memory usage, and bandwidth) show a range of -1 to 1. However, none of these values can ever go below zero. This will be resolved in a future release. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1904106[*BZ#1904106*])

* Before this update, users could not silence alerts in the *Developer* perspective in the {product-title} web console when a user-defined Alertmanager service was deployed because the web console would forward the request to the platform Alertmanager service in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace. With this update, when you view the *Developer* perspective in the web console and try to silence an alert, the request is forwarded to the correct Alertmanager service. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1789[*OCPBUGS-1789*])

* Previously, there was a known issue in the *Add Helm Chart Repositories* form to extend the Developer Catalog of a project. The *Quick Start* guides shows that you can add the `ProjectHelmChartRepository` CR in the required namespace whereas it does not mention that to perform this you need permission from the kubeadmin. This issue was resolved with *Quickstart* mentioning the correct steps to create `ProjectHelmChartRepository` CR. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2057306[*BZ#2057306*])

== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.8 and beyond! This needs some SME/QE review before being updated for 4.11. Need to check if KI should be removed or should stay.
* In {product-title} 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.
+
If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.1 to {product-version}, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. Unless there is a specific need for unauthenticated access, you should revoke it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.

* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])

* Due to the inclusion of old images in some image indexes, running `oc adm catalog mirror` and `oc image mirror` might result in the following error: `error: unable to retrieve source image`. As a temporary workaround, you can use the `--skip-missing` option to bypass the error and continue downloading the image index. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6975305[Service Mesh Operator mirroring failed].

* When using the egress IP address feature in {product-title} on {rh-openstack}, you can assign a floating IP address to a reservation port to have a predictable SNAT address for egress traffic. The floating IP address association must be created by the same user that installed the {product-title} cluster. Otherwise any delete or move operation for the egress IP address hangs indefinitely because of insufficient privileges. When this issue occurs, a user with sufficient privileges must manually unset the floating IP address association to resolve the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4902[*OCPBUGS-4902*])

* There is a known issue with Nutanix installation where the installation fails if you use 4096-bit certificates with Prism Central 2022.x. Instead, use 2048-bit certificates. (link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6976743[*KCS*])

* Deleting the bidirectional forwarding detection (BFD) profile and removing the `bfdProfile` added to the border gateway protocol (BGP) peer resource does not disable the BFD. Instead, the BGP peer starts using the default BFD profile. To disable BFD from a BGP peer resource, delete the BGP peer configuration and recreate it without a BFD profile. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2050824[*BZ#2050824*])

* Due to an unresolved metadata API issue, you cannot install clusters that use bare-metal workers on {rh-openstack} 16.1. Clusters on {rh-openstack} 16.2 are not impacted by this issue. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2033953[*BZ#2033953*])

* The `loadBalancerSourceRanges` attribute is not supported, and is therefore ignored, in load-balancer type services in clusters that run on {rh-openstack} and use the OVN Octavia provider. There is no workaround for this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2789[*OCPBUGS-2789*])

* After a catalog source update, it takes time for OLM to update the subscription status.
This can mean that the status of the subscription policy may continue to show as compliant when {cgu-operator-first} decides whether remediation is needed.
As a result the operator specified in the subscription policy does not get upgraded.
As a workaround, include a `status` field in the `spec` section of the catalog source policy as follows:
+
[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  name: redhat-operators-disconnected
spec:
  displayName: disconnected-redhat-operators
  image: registry.example.com:5000/disconnected-redhat-operators/disconnected-redhat-operator-index:v4.11
status:
  connectionState:
    lastObservedState: READY
----
+
This mitigates the delay for OLM to pull the new index image and get the pod ready, reducing the time between completion of catalog source policy remediation and the update of the subscription status.
If the issue persists and the subscription policy status update is still late you can apply another `ClusterGroupUpdate` CR with the same subscription policy, or an identical `ClusterGroupUpdate` CR with a different name.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2813[*OCPBUGS-2813*])

* {cgu-operator} skips remediating a policy if all selected clusters are compliant when the `ClusterGroupUpdate` CR is started.
The update of operators with a modified catalog source policy and a subscription policy in the same `ClusterGroupUpdate` CR does not complete.
The subscription policy is skipped as it is still compliant until the catalog source change is enforced.
As a workaround, add the following change to one CR in the `common-subscription` policy, for example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
metadata.annotations.upgrade: "1"
----
+
This makes the policy non-compliant prior to the start of the `ClusterGroupUpdate` CR.

* On a {sno} instance, rebooting without draining the node to remove all the running pods can cause issues with workload container recovery.
After the reboot, the workload restarts before all the device plugins are ready, resulting in resources not being available or the workload running on the wrong NUMA node.
The workaround is to restart the workload pods when all the device plugins have re-registered themselves during the reboot recovery procedure.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2180[*OCPBUGS-2180*])

* The default `dataset_comparison` is currently `ieee1588`. The recommended dataset_comparison is `G.8275.x`. It is planned to be fixed in a future version of  {product-title}. In the short term, you can manually update the ptp configuration to include the recommended `dataset_comparison`.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2336[*OCPBUGS-2336*])

* The default `step_threshold` is 0.0. The recommended `step_threshold` is 2.0. It is planned to be fixed in a future version of  {product-title}. In the short term, you can manually update the ptp configuration to include the recommended `step_threshold`.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3005[*OCPBUGS-3005*])

* The `BMCEventSubscription` CR fails to create a Redfish subscription for a spoke cluster in an ACM-deployed multi-cluster environment, where the metal3 service is only running on a hub cluster.
The workaround is to create the subscription by calling the Redfish API directly, for example, by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
curl -X POST -i --insecure -u "<BMC_username>:<BMC_password>" https://<BMC_IP>/redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

    "Destination": "https://hw-event-proxy-openshift-bare-metal-events.apps.example.com/webhook",
    "EventTypes": ["Alert"]
    }'
----
+
You should receive a `201 Created` response and a header with `Location: /redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions/<sub_id>` that indicates that the Redfish events subscription is successfully created.

* When using the GitOps ZTP pipeline to install a {sno} cluster in a disconnected environment, there should be two `CatalogSource` CRs applied in the cluster. One of the `CatalogSource` CRs gets deleted following multiple node reboots. As a workaround, you can change the default names, such as `certified-operators` and `redhat-operators`, of the catalog sources. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-46245[*OCPBUGSM-46245*])

* If an invalid subscription channel is specified in the subscription policy that is used to perform a cluster upgrade, the {cgu-operator-full} indicates a successful upgrade right after the policy is enforced because the `Subscription` state remains `AtLatestKnown`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-43618[*OCPBUGSM-43618*])

* The `SiteConfig` disk partition definition fails when applied to multiple nodes in a cluster. When a `SiteConfig` CR is used to provision a compact cluster, creating a valid `diskPartition` config on multiple nodes fails with a Kustomize plugin error. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-44403[*OCPBUGSM-44403*])

* If secure boot is currently disabled and you try to enable it using ZTP, the cluster installation does not start. When secure boot is enabled through ZTP, the boot options are configured before the virtual CD is attached. Therefore, the first boot from the existing hard disk has the secure boot turned on. The cluster installation gets stuck because the system never boots from the CD. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGSM-45085[*OCPBUGSM-45085*])

* Using {rh-rhacm-first}, spoke cluster deployments on Dell PowerEdge R640 servers are blocked when the virtual media does not disconnect the ISO in the iDRAC console after writing the image to the disk. As a workaround, disconnect the ISO manually through the Virtual Media tab in the iDRAC console.

* Low-latency applications that rely on high-resolution timers to wake up their threads might experience higher wake up latencies than expected.
Although the expected wake up latency is under 20us, latencies exceeding this can occasionally be seen when running the cyclictest tool for long durations (24 hours or more).
Testing has shown that wake up latencies are under 20us for over 99.999999% of the samples.

* SR-IOV VFs send GARP packets with the wrong MAC address when using Intel NICs.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHELPLAN-140971[*RHELPLAN-140971*])

* When using the GitOps ZTP method of managing clusters and deleting a cluster which has not completed installation, the cleanup of the cluster namespace on the hub cluster might hang indefinitely.
To complete the namespace deletion, remove the `baremetalhost.metal3.io` finalizer from two CRs in the cluster namespace:
. Remove the finalizer from the secret that is pointed to by the BareMetalHost CR `.spec.bmc.credentialsName`.
. Remove the finalizer from the `BareMetalHost` CR.
When these finalizers are removed the namespace termination completes within a few seconds.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3029[*OCPBUGS-3029*])

* The addition of a new feature in OCP 4.12 that enables UDP GRO also causes all veth devices to have one RX queue per available CPU (previously each veth had one queue).
Those queues are dynamically configured by OVN and there is no synchronization between latency tuning and this queue creation.
The latency tuning logic monitors the veth NIC creation events and starts configuring the RPS queue cpu masks before all the queues are properly created.
This means that some of the RPS queue masks are not configured. Since not all NIC queues are configured properly there is a chance of latency spikes in a real-time application that uses timing-sensitive cpus for communicating with services in other containers.
Applications that do not use kernel networking stack are not affected.

* Platform Operator and RukPak known issues:

** Deleting a platform Operator results in a cascading deletion of the underlying resources. This cascading deletion logic can only delete resources that are defined in the Operator Lifecycle Manager-based (OLM) Operator's bundle format. In the case that a platform Operator creates resources that are defined outside of that bundle format, then the platform Operator is responsible for handling this cleanup interaction. This behavior can be observed when installing the cert-manager Operator as a platform Operator, and then removing it. The expected behavior is that a namespace is left behind that the cert-manager Operator created.

** The platform Operators manager does not have any logic that compares the current and desired state of the cluster-scoped `BundleDeployment` resource it is managing. This leaves the possibility for a user who has sufficient role-based access control (RBAC) to manually modify that underlying `BundleDeployment` resource and can lead to situations where users can escalate their permissions to the `cluster-admin` role. By default, you should limit access to this resource to a small number of users that explicitly require access. The only supported client for the `BundleDeployment` resource during this Technology Preview release is the platform Operators manager component.

** OLM's Marketplace component is an optional cluster capability that can be disabled. This has implications during the Technology Preview release because platform Operators are currently only sourced from the `redhat-operators` catalog source that is managed by the Marketplace component. As a workaround, a cluster administrator can create this catalog source manually.

** The RukPak provisioner implementations do not have the ability to inspect the health or state of the resources that they are managing. This has implications for surfacing the generated `BundleDeployment` resource state to the `PlatformOperator` resource that owns it. If a `registry+v1` bundle contains manifests that can be successfully applied to the cluster, but will fail at runtime, such as a `Deployment` object referencing a non-existent image, the result is a successful status being reflected in individual `PlatformOperator` and `BundleDeployment` resources.

** Cluster administrators configuring `PlatformOperator` resources before cluster creation cannot easily determine the desired package name without leveraging an existing cluster or relying on documented examples. There is currently no validation logic that ensures an individually configured `PlatformOperator` resource will be able to successfully roll out to the cluster.

* When using the Technology Preview OCI feature with the oc-mirror CLI plugin, the mirrored catalog embeds all of the Operator bundles, instead of filtering only on those specified in the image set configuration file. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5085[*OCPBUGS-5085*])

* There is currently a known issue when you run the Agent-based {product-title} Installer to generate an ISO image from a directory where the previous release was used for ISO image generation. An error message is displayed with the release version not matching. As a workaround, create and use a new directory. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5159[*OCPBUGS#5159*])

* The defined capabilities in the `install-config.yaml` file are not applied in the Agent-based {product-title} installation. Currently, there is no workaround. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5129[*OCPBUGS#5129*])

* Fully populated load balancers on {rh-openstack} that are created with the OVN driver can contain pools that are stuck in a pending creation status. This issue can cause problems for clusters that are deployed on {rh-openstack}. To resolve the issue, update your {rh-openstack} packages. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2042976[*BZ#2042976*])

* Bulk load-balancer member updates on {rh-openstack} can return a 500 code in response to `PUT` requests. This issue can cause problems for clusters that are deployed on {rh-openstack}. To resolve the issue, update your {rh-openstack} packages. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2100135[*BZ#2100135*])

* Clusters that use external cloud providers can fail to retrieve updated credentials after rotation. The following platforms are affected:
+
--
** {alibaba}
** IBM Cloud VPC
** IBM Power
** {VirtProductName}
** {rh-openstack}

(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5036[*OCPBUGS-5036*])

* There is a known issue when `cloud-provider-openstack` tries to create health monitors on OVN load balancers by using the API to create fully populated load balancers. These health monitors become stuck in a `PENDING_CREATE` status. After their deletion, associated load balancers are are stuck in a `PENDING_UPDATE` status. There is no workaround. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2143732[*BZ#2143732*])

* Due to a known issue, to use stateful IPv6 networks with cluster that run on {rh-openstack}, you must include `ip=dhcp,dhcpv6` in the kernel arguments of xref:../nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-working.adoc#nodes-nodes-kernel-arguments_nodes-nodes-working[worker nodes]. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2104[*OCPBUGS-2104*])

* It is not possible to create a macvlan on the physical function (PF) when a virtual function (VF) already exists. This issue affects the Intel E810 NIC. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2120585[*BZ#2120585*])

* There is currently a known issue when manually configuring IPv6 addresses and routes on an IPv4 {product-title} cluster. When converting to a dual-stack cluster, newly created pods remain in the `ContainerCreating` status. Currently, there is no workaround. This issue is planned to be addressed in a future {product-title} release. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4411[*OCPBUGS-4411*])

* When an OVN cluster installed on IBM Public Cloud has more than 60 worker nodes, simultaneously creating 2000 or more services and route objects can cause pods created at the same time to remain in the `ContainerCreating` status. If this problem occurs, entering the `oc describe pod <podname>` command shows events with the following warning: `FailedCreatePodSandBox...failed to configure pod interface: timed out waiting for OVS port binding (ovn-installed)`. There is currently no workaround for this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3470[*OCPBUGS-3470*])

* When a control plane machine is replaced on a cluster that uses the OVN-Kubernetes network provider, the pods related to OVN-Kubernetes might not start on the replacement machine. When this occurs, the lack of networking on the new machine prevents etcd from allowing it to replace the old machine. As a result, the cluster is stuck in this state and might become degraded. This behavior can occur when the control plane is replaced manually or by the control plane machine set.
+
There is currently no workaround to resolve this issue if encountered. To avoid this issue, xref:../machine_management/control_plane_machine_management/cpmso-disabling.adoc[disable the control plane machine set] and do not replace control plane machines manually if your cluster uses the OVN-Kubernetes network provider. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5306[*OCPBUGS-5306*])

* If a cluster that was deployed through ZTP has policies that do not become compliant, and no `ClusterGroupUpdates` object is present, you must restart the {cgu-operator} pods. Restarting {cgu-operator} creates the proper `ClusterGroupUpdates` object, which enforces the policy compliance. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4065[*OCPBUGS-4065*])

* Currently, a certificate compliance issue, specifically outputted as `x509: certificate is not standards compliant`, exists when you run the installation program on macOS for the purposes of installing an {product-title} cluster on VMware vSphere. This issue relates to a known issue with the `golang` compiler in that the compiler does not recognize newly supported macOS certificate standards. No workaround exists for this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSDOCS-5694[*OSDOCS-5694*])

* Currently, when using a persistent volume (PV) that contains a very large number of files, the pod might not start or can take an excessive amount of time to start. For more information, see this link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6221251[knowledge base article]. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1987112[*BZ1987112*])

* Creating pods with Azure File NFS volumes that are scheduled to the control plane node causes the mount to be denied. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18581[*OCPBUGS-18581*])
+
To work around this issue: If your control plane nodes are schedulable, and the pods can run on worker nodes, use `nodeSelector` or Affinity to schedule the pod in worker nodes.

* When installing an {product-title} cluster with static IP addressing and Tang encryption, nodes start without network settings. This condition prevents nodes from accessing the Tang server, causing installation to fail. To address this condition, you must set the network settings for each node as `ip` installer arguments.
+
. For installer-provisioned infrastructure, before installation provide the network settings as `ip` installer arguments for each node by executing the following steps.
.. Create the manifests.

.. For each node, modify the `BareMetalHost` custom resource with annotations to include the network settings. For example:

<7> `<role>` with `worker` or `master` to reflect the node's role
<8> `<bmc_ip>` with with the BMC IP address and the protocol and path of the BMC, as needed.

.. Save the file to the `clusterconfigs/openshift` directory.

.. Create the cluster.

. When installing with the {ai-full}, before installation modify each node's installer arguments using the API to append the network settings as `ip` installer arguments. For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ curl https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/infra-envs/${infra_env_id}/hosts/${host_id}/installer-args \
-X PATCH \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '
    {
      "args": [
        "--append-karg",
        "ip=<static_ip>::<gateway>:<netmask>:<hostname_1>:<interface>:none", <1> <2> <3> <4> <5>
        "--save-partindex",
        "1",
        "-n"
      ]
    }
  ' | jq
----
For the previous network settings, replace:
<1> `<static_ip>` with the static IP address for the node, for example, `192.168.1.100`
<2> `<gateway>` with the IP address of your network's gateway, for example, `192.168.1.1`
<3> `<netmask>` with the network mask, for example, `255.255.255.0`
<4> `<hostname_1>` with the node's hostname, for example, `node1.example.com`
<5> `<interface>` with the name of the network interface, for example, `eth0`.

==== Bug fixes

* Previously, due to a wrong check in the OpenStack cloud provider, the load balancers were populated with External IP addresses when all of the Octavia load balancers were created. This increased the time for the load balancers to be handled. With this update, load balancers are still created sequentially and External IP addresses are populated one-by-one. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5403[*OCPBUGS-5403*])

* Previously, the `cluster-image-registry-operator` would default to using persistent volume claim (PVC) when it failed to reach Swift. With this update, failure to connect to {rh-openstack-first} API or other incidental failures cause the `cluster-image-registry-operator` to retry the probe. During the retry, the default to PVC only occurs if the {rh-openstack} catalog is correctly found, and it does not contain object storage; or alternatively, if {rh-openstack} catalog is there and the current user does not have permission to list containers.

* Previously, in the repositories list, you could see the *PipelineRuns* only when the status was `Succeeded` or `Failed` but not when the status was `Running`. With this fix, when the *PipelineRuns* is triggered, you can see it in the repositories list with the status `Running`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-6816[*OCPBUGS-6816*])

* Previously, when creating a `Secret`, the *Start Pipeline* model created an invalid JSON value, As a result, the Secret was unusable and the `PipelineRun` could fail. With this fix, the *Start Pipeline* model creates a valid JSON value for the `Secret`. Now, you can create valid Secrets while starting a Pipeline. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-6671[*OCPBUGS-6671*])

* Previously, when a `BindableKinds` resource did not have a status, the web console crashed, fetching and showing the same data in a loop. With this fix, you can set the `BindableKinds` resource status array to `[]`, expecting it to exist without a status field. As a result, the web browser or the application does not crash. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4072[*OCPBUGS-4072*])

* Previously, the associated webhook `<kn-service-name>-github-webhook-secret` did not delete when deleting a Knative (`kn`) service from {product-title}. With this fix, all the associated webhook secrets are deleted. Now, you can create a Knative (`kn`) service with the same name as the deleted one.

==== Bug fixes

* Previously, validation was not preventing users from installing a GCP cluster into a shared VPC if they did not enable the Technology Preview feature gate. Therefore, you could install a cluster into a shared VPC without enabling the Technology Preview feature gate. This release added a feature gate validation to 4.12 so you must enable `featureSet: TechPreviewNoUpgrade` to install a GCP cluster into a shared VPC. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-7469[*OCPBUGS-7469*])

* Previously, MTU migration configuration would sometimes be cleaned up before the migration was complete causing the migration to fail. This release ensures that the MTU migration is preserved while migration is in progress so that the migration can complete successfully.

==== Bug fixes

* Previously, the `openshift-install agent create cluster-manifests` command required a non-empty list of `imageContentSources` in the `install-config.yaml` file. If no image content sources were supplied, the command generated the error `failed to write asset (Mirror Registries Config) to disk: failed to write file: open .: is a directory`. With this update, the command works whether or not the `imageContentSources` section of `install-config.yaml` file contains anything. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-8384[*OCPBUGS-8384*])

* Previously, the OpenStack Machine API provider had to be restarted so that new cloud credentials were used in the event of a rotation of the OpenStack `clouds.yaml` file. Consequently, the ability of a MachineSet to scale to zero was affected. With this update, cloud credentials are no longer cached and the OpenStack Machine API provider reads the corresponding secret on demand.

==== Bug fixes

* Previously, the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration ignored Kuryr's maximum transmission unit (MTU) settings when using the {rh-openstack-first} Networking service (neutron) component to create a network for OpenShift services. CNO would create a network in Neutron with the wrong MTU property, and this action could cause incompatibility issues among network components. With this update, the CNO does not ignore the Kuryr MTU setting when creating the network for services. You can then use the network to host OpenShift services.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4896[*OCPBUGS-4896*])

==== Bug fixes

* Previously on {sno}, in case of node reboot there was a race condition that could result in admission of application pods requesting devices on the node even if devices were unhealthy or unavailable to be allocated. This resulted in runtime failures when the application tried to access devices. With this update, the resources requested by the pod are only allocated if the device plugin has registered itself to kubelet and healthy devices are present on the node to be allocated.
+
If these conditions are not met, the pod can fail at admission with `UnexpectedAdmissionError` error, which is an expected behavior. If the application pod is part of deployments, in case of failure subsequent pods are created and ultimately successfully run when devices are suitable to be allocated.

==== Bug fixes

* Previously, client TLS (mTLS) was configured on an Ingress Controller, and the certificate authority (CA) in the client CA bundle required more than 1MB of certificate revocation list (CRLs) to be downloaded. The CRL `ConfigMap` object size limitations prevented updates from occurring. As a result of the missing CRLs, connections with valid client certificates may have been rejected with the error `unknown ca`. With this update, the CRL `ConfigMap` for each Ingress Controller no longer exists; instead, each router pod directly downloads CRLs, ensuring connections with valid client certificates are no longer rejected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-14454[*OCPBUGS-14454*])

* Previously, because client TLS (mTLS) was configured on an Ingress Controller, mismatches between the distributing certificate authority (CA) and the issuing CA caused the incorrect certificate revocation list (CRL) to be downloaded. As a result, the incorrect CRL was downloaded instead of the correct CRL, causing connections with valid client certificates to be rejected with the error message `unknown ca`. With this update, downloaded CRLs are now tracked by the CA that distributes them. This ensures that valid client certificates are no longer rejected.

==== NUMA-aware scheduling with the NUMA Resources Operator is generally available

NUMA-aware scheduling with the NUMA Resources Operator was previously introduced as a Technology Preview in {product-title} 4.10. It is now generally available in {product-title} version 4.12.24 and later.

The NUMA Resources Operator deploys a NUMA-aware secondary scheduler that makes scheduling decisions for workloads based on a complete picture of available NUMA zones in clusters. This enhanced NUMA-aware scheduling ensures that latency-sensitive workloads are processed in a single NUMA zone for maximum efficiency and performance.

This update adds the following features:

* Fine-tuning of API polling for NUMA resource reports.
* Configuration options at the node group level for the node topology exporter.

[NOTE]
====
NUMA-aware scheduling with the NUMA Resources Operator is not yet available on {sno}.

With this update, users can configure the `protocolStrategy` field on the `dnses.operator.openshift.io` custom resource to be "TCP". This resolves issues with non-compliant upstream DNS servers. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-15251[*OCPBUGS-15251*])

* Previously, the {product-title} Router directed traffic to a route with a weight of `0` when it had only one back end. With this update, the router will not send traffic to routes with a single back end with weight `0`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18639[*OCPBUGS-18639*])

* Previously, the cloud credentials used in Manila CSI Driver Operator were cached, resulting in authentication issues if these credentials were rotated. With this update, this issue is resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18475[*OCPBUGS-18475*])

==== Bug fixes

* Previously, the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) did not reconcile `SecurityContextConstraints` (SCC) resources as expected. The CVO now properly reconciles the `volumes` field in the `SecurityContextConstraints` resources towards the state defined in the release image. User modifications to system SCC resources are tolerated.

* Previously, when the most recent and default channels were selectively mirrored, and a new release introduced a new channel, the current default channel became invalid. This caused the automatic assignment of the new default channel to fail. With this release, you can now define a `defaultChannel` field in the `ImageSetConfig` custom resource (CR) that overrides the `currentDefault` channel.

* Previously, the `compat-openssl10` package was included in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS). This package did not meet Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) remediation requirements for Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). With this release, `compat-openssl10` has been removed from the RHCOS. As a result, security scanners will no longer identify potential common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) in this package.

* Previously, the `manila-csi-driver-controller-metrics` service had empty endpoints due to an incorrect name for the app selector. With this release the app selector name is changed to `openstack-manila-csi` and the issue is fixed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-30295[*OCPBUGS-30295*])

==== Bug fixes

* Previously, two components (`tuned` and `irqbalanced`) were modifying the `irq` CPU affinity simultaneously, which caused issues. With this release, the `irqbalanced` component is the only component that configures the interrupt affinity and the issues are resolved.

==== Bug fixes

* Previously, the `clear-irqbalance-banned-cpus.sh` script set an empty value for `IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS` in the `/etc/sysconfig/irqbalance` pod annotation. As a result, the IRQs only balanced over the reserved CPUs. With this release, the `clear-irqbalance-banned-cpus.sh` script sets the banned mask to zeros on startup and the issue has been resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31442[*OCPBUGS-31442*])

* Previously, a kernel regression introduced in {product-title} versions 4.15.0, 4.14.14, 4.13.36, and 4.12.54 led to potential kernel panics in nodes and mounted CephFS volumes. In this release, the regression issue is fixed so that the kernel regression issue no longer occurs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33253[*OCPBUGS-33253*])

==== Bug fixes

* Previously, some container processes created by using the `exec` command persisted even when CRI-O stopped the container. Consequently, lingering processes led to tracking issues, causing process leaks and defunct statuses. With this release, CRI-O tracks the `exec` calls processed for a container and ensures that the processes created as part of the `exec` calls are terminated when the container is stopped. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33175[*OCPBUGS-33175*])

* Previously, an issue with NodePort traffic-forwarding caused the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) traffic to be directed to pods under a terminating state. With this release, the endpoints selection logic fully implements `KEP-1669 ProxyTerminatingEndpoints` and the issue has been resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33422[*OCPBUGS-33422*])

* Previously, the load balancing algorithm did not differentiate between active and inactive services when determining weights, and it employed the `random` algorithm excessively in environments with many inactive services or environments routing backends with weight 0. This led to increased memory usage and a higher risk of excessive memory consumption. With this release, changes are made to optimize traffic direction towards active services only and prevent unnecessary use of the `random` algorithm with higher weights, reducing the potential for excessive memory consumption. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33517[*OCPBUGS-33517*])

* Previously, the load-balancing algorithm had flaws that led to increased memory usage and a higher risk of excessive memory consumption. With this release, the service filtering logic for load-balancing is updated and the issue has been resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33778[*OCPBUGS-33778*])

==== Known issue

* Sometimes, the Console Operator status can get stuck in a failed state when the Operator is removed. To work around this issue, patch the Console controller to reset all conditions to the default state when the Console Operator is removed. For example, log in to the cluster and run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch console.operator.openshift.io/cluster --type='merge' -p='{"status":{"conditions":null}}'
----
+
