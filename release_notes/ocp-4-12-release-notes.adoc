This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

[id="ocp-4-12-rhcos"]
=== {op-system-first}

[id="ocp-4-12-installation-and-upgrade"]
=== Installation and upgrade

[id="ocp-4-12-aws-load-balancer-customization"]
==== Specify the load balancer type in AWS during installation
Beginning with {product-title} {product-version}, you can specify either Network Load Balancer (NLB) or Classic as a persistent load balancer type in AWS during installation. Afterwards, if an Ingress Controller is deleted, the load balancer type persists with the lbType configured during installation.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-network-customizations.adoc[Installing a cluster on AWS with network customizations].

[id="ocp-4-12-installation-and-upgrade-gcp-marketplace"]
==== Google Cloud Platform Marketplace offering
{product-title} is now available on the GCP Marketplace. Installing an {product-title} with a GCP Marketplace image lets you create self-managed cluster deployments that are billed on pay-per-use basis (hourly, per core) through GCP, while still being supported directly by Red Hat.

For more information about installing using installer-provisioned infrastructure, see xref:../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-customizations.adoc#installation-gcp-marketplace_installing-gcp-customizations[Using a GCP Marketplace image]. For more information about installing a using user-provisioned infrastructure, see xref:../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-user-infra.adoc#installation-creating-gcp-worker_installing-gcp-user-infra[Creating additional worker machines in GCP].

[id="ocp-4-12-gcp-azure-serial-console-logs"]
==== Troubleshooting bootstrap failures during installation on GCP and Azure
The installer now gathers serial console logs from the bootstrap and control plane hosts on GCP and Azure. This log data is added to the standard bootstrap log bundle.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing-troubleshooting.adoc#installation-bootstrap-gather_installing-troubleshooting[Troubleshooting installation issues].

[id="ocp-4-12-ibm-cloud-vpc"]
==== IBM Cloud VPC general availability
IBM Cloud VPC is now generally available in {product-title} {product-version}.

For more information about installing a cluster, see xref:../installing/installing_ibm_cloud_public/preparing-to-install-on-ibm-cloud.adoc#preparing-to-install-on-ibm-cloud[Preparing to install on IBM Cloud VPC].

[id="ocp-4-12-admin-ack-upgrading"]
==== Required administrator acknowledgment when upgrading from {product-title} 4.11 to 4.12

{product-title} 4.12 uses Kubernetes 1.25, which removed xref:../release_notes/ocp-4-12-release-notes.adoc#ocp-4-12-removed-kube-1-25-apis[several deprecated APIs].

A cluster administrator must provide a manual acknowledgment before the cluster can be upgraded from {product-title} 4.11 to 4.12. This is to help prevent issues after upgrading to {product-title} 4.12, where APIs that have been removed are still in use by workloads, tools, or other components running on or interacting with the cluster. Administrators must evaluate their cluster for any APIs in use that will be removed and migrate the affected components to use the appropriate new API version. After this is done, the administrator can provide the administrator acknowledgment.

All {product-title} 4.11 clusters require this administrator acknowledgment before they can be upgraded to {product-title} 4.12.

For more information, see xref:../updating/updating-cluster-prepare.adoc#updating-cluster-prepare[Preparing to update to {product-title} 4.12].

[id="ocp-4-12-feature-set"]

[id="ocp-4-12-nw-metrics-telemetry"]
==== Capturing metrics and telemetry associated with the use of routes and shards

In {product-title} 4.12, the Cluster Ingress Operator exports a new metric named `route_metrics_controller_routes_per_shard`. The `shard_name` label of the metric specifies the name of the shards. This metric gives the total number of routes that are admitted by each shard.

The following metrics are sent through telemetry.

.Metrics sent through telemetry
[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Recording rule expression | Description

| `cluster:route_metrics_controller_routes_per_shard:min`
| `min(route_metrics_controller_routes_per_shard)`
| Tracks the minimum number of routes admitted by any of the shards

| `cluster:route_metrics_controller_routes_per_shard:max`
| `max(route_metrics_controller_routes_per_shard)`
| Tracks the maximum number of routes admitted by any of the shards

| Tracks the median value of the `route_metrics_controller_routes_per_shard` metric

| `cluster:openshift_route_info:tls_termination:sum`
| `sum (openshift_route_info) by (tls_termination)`
| Tracks the number of routes for each `tls_termination` value. The possible values for `tls_termination` are `edge`, `passthrough` and `reencrypt`

|===

[id="ocp-4-12-nw-aws-load-balancer-operator"]
==== AWS Load Balancer Operator

In {product-title} 4.12, the AWS Load Balancer controller now implements the Kubernetes Ingress specification for multiple matches. If multiple paths within an Ingress match a request, the longest matching path takes the precedence. If two paths still match, paths with an exact path type take precedence over a prefix path type.

The AWS Load Balancer Operator sets the `EnableIPTargetType` feature gate to `false`. The AWS Load Balancer controller disables the support for services and ingress resources for `target-type` `ip`.

The upstream version of `aws-load-balancer-controller` for an {product-title} 4.12 is v2.4.4.

[id="ocp-4-12-nw-ingress-autoscaling"]
==== Ingress Controller Autoscaling (Technology Preview)

You can now use the {product-title} Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator to dynamically scale the default Ingress Controller based on metrics in your deployed cluster, such as the number of worker nodes available. The Custom Metrics Autoscaler is available as a Technology Preview feature.

For more information, see xref:../networking/ingress-operator.adoc#nw-autoscaling-ingress-controller_configuring-ingress[Autoscaling an Ingress Controller].

[id="ocp-4-12-nw-ingress-haproxy-maxconn-default"]

[id="ocp-4-12-ipv6-gratuitous-ARPs-default-SR-IOV"]
==== IPv6 unsolicited neighbor advertisements and IPv4 gratuitous address resolution protocol now default on the SR-IOV CNI plugin

Pods created with the Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) CNI plugin, where the IP address management CNI plugin has assigned IPs, now send IPv6 unsolicited neighbor advertisements and/or IPv4 gratuitous address resolution protocol by default onto the network. This enhancement notifies hosts of the new pod's MAC address for a particular IP to refresh ARP/NDP caches with the correct information.

For more information, see xref:../networking/hardware_networks/about-sriov.adoc#supported-devices_about-sriov[Supported devices].

[id="ocp-4-12-coredns-cache-tuning"]

You can now configure the time-to-live (TTL) duration of both successful and unsuccessful DNS queries cached by CoreDNS.

For more information, see xref:../networking/dns-operator.adoc#nw-dns-cache-tuning_dns-operator[Tuning the CoreDNS cache].

[id="ocp-4-12-ovn-kubernetes-supports-configuration-internal-subnet"]
==== OVN-Kubernetes supports configuration of internal subnet

Previously, the subnet that OVN-Kubernetes uses internally was `100.64.0.0/16` for IPv4 and `fd98::/48` for IPv6 and could not be modified. To support instances when these subnets overlap with existing subnets in your infrastructure, you can now change these internal subnets to avoid any overlap.

For more information, see xref:../networking/cluster-network-operator.adoc#nw-operator-cr-cno-object_cluster-network-operator[Cluster Network Operator configuration object]

[id=ocp-4-12-egress-ip-support]
==== Egress IP support on {rh-openstack-first}

{rh-openstack}, paired with {product-title}, now supports automatic attachment and detachment of Egress IP addresses. The traffic from one or more pods in any number of namespaces has a consistent source IP address for services outside of the cluster. This support applies to OpenShift SDN and OVN-Kubernetes as default network providers.

[id="ocp-4-12-openshift-sdn-ovn-kubernetes-feature-migration-support"]
==== OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes feature migration support

If you plan to migrate from the OpenShift SDN network plugin to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, your configurations for the following capabilities are automatically converted to work with OVN-Kubernetes:

* Egress IP addresses
* Egress firewalls
* Multicast

For more information about how the migration to OVN-Kubernetes works, see xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/migrate-from-openshift-sdn.adoc#migrate-from-openshift-sdn[Migrating from the OpenShift SDN cluster network provider].

[id="ocp-4-12-egress-firewall-audit-logging"]
==== Egress firewall audit logging

For the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, egress firewalls support audit logging using the same mechanism that network policy audit logging uses. For more information, see xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/logging-network-policy.adoc#logging-network-policy[Logging for egress firewall and network policy rules].

[id="ocp-4-12-announce-IP-from-node-subset-metallb"]
==== Advertise MetalLB from a given address pool from a subset of nodes
With this update, in BGP mode, you can use the node selector to advertise the MetalLB service from a subset of nodes, using a specific pool of IP addresses. This feature was introduced as a Technology Preview feature in {product-title} 4.11 and is now generally available in {product-title} 4.12 for BGP mode only. L2 mode remains a Technology Preview feature.

For more information, see xref:../networking/metallb/about-advertising-ipaddresspool.adoc#nw-metallb-advertise-ip-pools-to-node-subset_about-advertising-ip-address-pool[Advertising an IP address pool from a subset of nodes].

[id="ocp-4-12-ne-metallb-deployment-specs"]
==== Additional deployment specifications for MetalLB
This update provides additional deployment specifications for MetalLB. When you use a custom resource to deploy MetalLB, you can use these additional deployment specifications to manage how MetalLB `speaker` and `controller` pods deploy and run in your cluster. For example, you can use MetalLB deployment specifications to manage where MetalLB pods are deployed, define CPU limits for MetalLB pods, and assign runtime classes to MetalLB pods.

For more information about deployment specifications for MetalLB, see xref:../networking/metallb/metallb-operator-install.adoc#nw-metallb-operator-deployment-specifications-for-metallb_metallb-operator-install[Deployment specifications for MetalLB].

[id="overriding-default-node-ip-selection-logic"]
==== Node IP selection improvements

Previously, the `nodeip-configuration` service on a cluster host selected the IP address from the interface that the default route used. If multiple routes were present, the service would select the route with the lowest metric value. As a result, network traffic could be distributed from the incorrect interface.

With {product-title} 4.12, a new interface has been added to the `nodeip-configuration` service, which allows users to create a hint file. The hint file contains a variable, `NODEIP_HINT`, that overrides the default IP selection logic and selects a specific node IP address from the subnet `NODEIP_HINT` variable. Using the `NODEIP_HINT` variable allows users to specify which IP address is used, ensuring that network traffic is distributed from the correct interface.

For more information, see xref:../support/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-network-issues.adoc#overriding-default-node-ip-selection-logic_troubleshooting-network-issues[Optional: Overriding the default node IP selection logic].

[id="ocp-4-12-ne-coredns-bump"]
==== CoreDNS update to version 1.10.0

In {product-title} {product-version}, CoreDNS uses version 1.10.0, which includes the following changes:

* CoreDNS does not expand the query UDP buffer size if it was previously set to a smaller value.
* CoreDNS now always prefixes each log line in Kubernetes client logs with the associated log level.
* CoreDNS now reloads more quickly at an approximate speed of 20ms.

==== Updating the interface-specific safe list (Technology Preview)

{product-title} now supports updating the default interface-specific safe `sysctls`.

You can add or remove `sysctls` from the predefined list.
When you add `sysctls`, they can be set across all nodes.
Updating the interface-specific safe `sysctls` list is a Technology Preview feature only.

=== Monitoring

The monitoring stack for this release includes the following new and modified features.

[id="ocp-4-12-monitoring-updates-to-monitoring-stack-compnents-and-dependencies"]
==== Updates to monitoring stack components and dependencies
This release includes the following version updates for monitoring stack components and dependencies:

* kube-state-metrics to 2.6.0
* node-exporter to 1.4.0
* prom-label-proxy to 0.5.0
* Prometheus to 2.39.1
* prometheus-adapter to 0.10.0
* prometheus-operator to 0.60.1
* Thanos to 0.28.1

[id="ocp-4-12-monitoring-changes-to-alerting-rules"]
==== Changes to alerting rules

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat does not guarantee backward compatibility for recording rules or alerting rules.
====

* *New*
** Added the `TelemeterClientFailures` alert, which triggers when a cluster tries and fails to submit Telemetry data at a certain rate over a period of time. The alert fires when the rate of failed requests reaches 20% of the total rate of requests within a 15-minute window.
* *Changed*
** The `KubeAggregatedAPIDown` alert now waits 900 seconds rather than 300 seconds before sending a notification.
** The `NodeClockNotSynchronising` and `NodeClockSkewDetected` alerts now only evaluate metrics from the `node-exporter` job.
** The `NodeRAIDDegraded` and `NodeRAIDDiskFailure` alerts now include a device label filter to match only the value returned by `mmcblk.p.+|nvme.+|sd.+|vd.+|xvd.+|dm-.+|dasd.+`.
** The `PrometheusHighQueryLoad` and `ThanosQueryOverload` alerts now also trigger when a high querying load exists on the query layer.

[id="ocp-4-12-monitoring-new-option-to-specify-pod-topology-spread-constraints-for-monitoring-components"]
==== New option to specify pod topology spread constraints for monitoring components
You can now use pod topology spread constraints to control how Prometheus, Thanos Ruler, and Alertmanager pods are spread across a network topology when {product-title} pods are deployed in multiple availability zones.

[id="ocp-4-12-monitoring-new-option-to-improve-data-consistency-for-prometheus-adapter"]
==== New option to improve data consistency for Prometheus Adapter
You can now configure an optional kubelet service monitor for Prometheus Adapter (PA) that improves data consistency across multiple autoscaling requests.
Enabling this service monitor eliminates the possibility that two queries sent at the same time to PA might yield different results because the underlying PromQL queries executed by PA might be on different Prometheus servers.

[id="ocp-4-12-monitoring-update-to-alertmanager-configuration-for-additional-secret-keys"]
==== Update to Alertmanager configuration for additional secret keys
With this release, if you configure an Alertmanager secret to hold additional keys and if the Alertmanager configuration references these keys as files (such as templates, TLS certificates, or tokens), your configuration settings must point to these keys by using an absolute path rather than a relative path.
These keys are available under the `/etc/alertmanager/config` directory.
In earlier releases of {product-title}, you could use relative paths in your configuration to point to these keys because the Alertmanager configuration file was located in the same directory as the keys.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are upgrading to {product-title} {product-version} and have specified relative paths for additional Alertmanager secret keys that are referenced as files, you must change these relative paths to absolute paths in your Alertmanager configuration.
Otherwise, alert receivers that use the files will fail to deliver notifications.

[id="ocp-4-12-scalability-and-performance"]
=== Scalability and performance

[id="ocp-4-12-rsp-workload-hints"]
==== Disabling realtime using workload hints removes Receive Packet Steering from the cluster
At the cluster level by default, a systemd service sets a Receive Packet Steering (RPS) mask for virtual network interfaces. The RPS mask routes interrupt requests from virtual network interfaces according to the list of reserved CPUs defined in the performance profile. At the container level, a `CRI-O` hook script also sets an RPS mask for all virtual network devices.

With this update, if you set `spec.workloadHints.realTime` in the performance profile to `False`, the system also disables both the systemd service and the `CRI-O` hook script which set the RPS mask. The system disables these RPS functions because RPS is typically relevant to use cases requiring low-latency, realtime workloads only.

To retain RPS functions even when you set `spec.workloadHints.realTime` to `False`, see the _RPS Settings_ section of the Red Hat Knowledgebase solution link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5532341[Performance addons operator advanced configuration].

For more information about configuring workload hints, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/cnf-low-latency-tuning.adoc#cnf-understanding-workload-hints_cnf-master[Understanding workload hints].

[id="ocp-4-12-tuned"]
==== Tuned profile

The `tuned` profile now defines the `fs.aio-max-nr` `sysctl` value by default, improving asynchronous I/O performance for default node profiles.

[id="tuning-of-power-states"]
==== Power-saving configurations

In {product-title} {product-version}, by enabling C-states and OS-controlled P-states, you can use different power-saving configurations for critical and non-critical workloads. You can apply the configurations through the new `perPodPowerManagement` workload hint, and the `cpu-c-states.crio.io` and `cpu-freq-governor.crio.io` CRI-O annotations. For more information about the feature, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/cnf-low-latency-tuning.adoc#node-tuning-operator-pod-power-saving-config_cnf-master[Power-saving configurations].

[id="scalability-and-performance-sno-additional-worker-node"]
==== {sno-caps} cluster expansion with worker nodes

In {product-title} {product-version}, you can expand your existing {sno} clusters with additional worker nodes to increase available resources. For more information about {sno} expansion, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-sno-additional-worker-node.adoc#ztp-additional-worker-sno_sno-additional-worker[Single-node OpenShift cluster expansion with worker nodes].

[id="ocp-4-12-rhosp-application-credentials"]
==== Application credentials on {rh-openstack}

You can now specify link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/16.1/html/users_and_identity_management_guide/application_credentials[application credentials] in the `clouds.yaml` files of clusters that run on {rh-openstack-first}. Application credentials are an alternative to embedding user account details in configuration files. As an example, see the following section of a `clouds.yaml` file that includes user account details:

[source,yaml]
----
clouds:
    openstack:
        auth:
            auth_url: https://127.0.0.1:13000
            password: thepassword
            project_domain_name: Default
            project_name: theprojectname
            user_domain_name: Default
            username: theusername
        region_name: regionOne
----

Compare that section to one that uses application credentials:

[source,yaml]
----
clouds:
    openstack:
        auth:
            auth_url: https://127.0.0.1:13000
            application_credential_id: '5dc185489adc4b0f854532e1af81ffe0'
            application_credential_secret: 'PDCTKans2bPBbaEqBLiT_IajG8e5J_nJB4kvQHjaAy6ufhod0Zl0NkNoBzjn_bWSYzk587ieIGSlT11c4pVehA'
        auth_type: "v3applicationcredential"
        region_name: regionOne
----

To use application credentials with your cluster as a {rh-openstack} administrator, create the credentials. Then, use them in a `clouds.yaml` file when you install a cluster. Alternatively, you can create the `clouds.yaml` file and rotate it into an existing cluster.


[id="ocp-4-12-notable-technical-changes"]
== Notable technical changes

{product-title} {product-version} introduces the following notable technical changes.

// Note: use [discrete] for these sub-headings.

[id="ocp-4-12-auth-aws-sts-endpoints"]
=== AWS Security Token Service regional endpoints

The Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`) now creates secrets that use regional endpoints for the xref:../authentication/managing_cloud_provider_credentials/cco-mode-sts.adoc[AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS)]. This approach aligns with AWS recommended best practices.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-12-auth-ccoctl-gcp-del-dir"]
=== Credentials requests directory parameter for deleting GCP resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

With this release, when you xref:../installing/installing_gcp/uninstalling-cluster-gcp.adoc#cco-ccoctl-deleting-sts-resources_uninstalling-cluster-gcp[delete GCP resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility], you must specify the directory containing the files for the component `CredentialsRequest` objects.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-12-psa-restricted-enforcement"]
=== Future restricted enforcement for pod security admission

Currently, pod security violations are shown as warnings and logged in the audit logs, but do not cause the pod to be rejected.

Global restricted enforcement for pod security admission is currently planned for the next minor release of {product-title}. When this restricted enforcement is enabled, pods with pod security violations will be rejected.

To prepare for this upcoming change, ensure that your workloads match the pod security admission profile that applies to them. Workloads that are not configured according to the enforced security standards defined globally or at the namespace level will be rejected. The `restricted-v2` SCC admits workloads according to the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#restricted[Restricted] Kubernetes definition.

If you are receiving pod security violations, see the following resources:

* See xref:../authentication/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission.adoc#security-context-constraints-psa-alert-eval_understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission[Identifying pod security violations] for information about how to find which workloads are causing pod security violations.

* See xref:../authentication/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission.adoc#security-context-constraints-psa-synchronization_understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission[Security context constraint synchronization with pod security standards] to understand when pod security admission label synchronization is performed. Pod security admission labels are not synchronized in certain situations, such as the following situations:
** The workload is running in a system-created namespace that is prefixed with `openshift-`.
** The workload is running on a pod that was created directly without a pod controller.

* If necessary, you can set a custom admission profile on the namespace or pod by setting the `pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce` label.

The next minor release of {product-title} is expected to use Kubernetes 1.26. Currently, Kubernetes 1.26 is scheduled to remove several deprecated APIs.

See the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-26[Deprecated API Migration Guide] in the upstream Kubernetes documentation for the list of planned Kubernetes API removals.

See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6955985[Navigating Kubernetes API deprecations and removals] for information about how to check your cluster for Kubernetes APIs that are planned for removal.

[id="ocp-4-12-bare-metal-hardware-bug-fixes"]
==== Bare Metal Hardware Provisioning

* In recent versions of server firmware the time between server operations has increased. This causes timeouts during installer-provisioned infrastructure (IPI) installations when the {product-title} installation program waits for a response from the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC). The new `python3-sushy` release increases the number of server side attempts to contact the BMC. This update accounts for the extended waiting time and avoids timeouts during installation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4097[*OCPBUGS-4097*])

* Before this update, the Ironic provisioning service did not support Baseboard Management Controllers (BMC) that use weak eTags combined with strict eTag validation. By design, if the BMC provides a weak eTag, Ironic returns two eTags: the original eTag and the original eTag converted to the strong format for compatibility with BMC that do not support weak eTags. Although Ironic can send two eTags, BMC using strict eTag validation rejects such requests due to the presence of the second eTag. As a result, on some older server hardware, bare-metal provisioning failed with the following error: `HTTP 412 Precondition Failed`. In {product-title} 4.12 and later, this behavior changes and Ironic no longer attempts to send two eTags in cases where a weak eTag is provided. Instead, if a Redfish request dependent on an eTag fails with an eTag validation error, Ironic retries the request with known workarounds. This minimizes the risk of bare-metal provisioning failures on machines with strict eTag validation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3479[*OCPBUGS-3479*])

* Before this update, when a Redfish system features a Settings URI, the Ironic provisioning service always attempts to use this URI to make changes to boot related BIOS settings. However, bare-metal provisioning fails if the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) features a Settings URI but does not support changing a particular BIOS setting by using this Settings URI. In {product-title} 4.12 and later, if a system features a Settings URI, Ironic verifies that it can change a particular BIOS setting by using the Settings URI before proceeding. Otherwise, Ironic implements the change by using the System URI. This additional logic ensures that Ironic can apply boot-related BIOS setting changes and bare-metal provisioning can succeed.

==== Builds

* By default, Buildah prints steps to the log file, including the contents of environment variables, which might include xref:../cicd/builds/creating-build-inputs.adoc#builds-input-secrets-configmaps_creating-build-inputs[build input secrets]. Although you can use the `--quiet` build argument to suppress printing of those environment variables, this argument isn't available if you use the source-to-image (S2I) build strategy. The current release fixes this issue. To suppress printing of environment variables, set the `BUILDAH_QUIET` environment variable in your build configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
sourceStrategy:
...
  env:
    - name: "BUILDAH_QUIET"
      value: "true"

[id="ocp-4-12-cloud-compute-bug-fixes"]
==== Cloud Compute

* Previously, instances were not set to respect the GCP infrastructure default option for automated restarts. As a result, instances could be created without using the infrastructure default for automatic restarts. This sometimes meant that instances were terminated in GCP but their associated machines were still listed in the `Running` state because they did not automatically restart. With this release, the code for passing the automatic restart option has been improved to better detect and pass on the default option selection from users. Instances now use the infrastructure default properly and are automatically restarted when the user requests the default functionality. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4504[*OCPBUGS-4504*])

* Previously, the GCP machine controller reconciled the state of machines every 10 hours. Other providers set this value to 10 minutes so that changes that happen outside of the Machine API system are detected within a short period. The longer reconciliation period for GCP could cause unexpected issues such as missing certificate signing requests (CSR) approvals due to an external IP address being added but not detected for an extended period. With this release, the GCP machine controller is updated to reconcile every 10 minutes to be consistent with other platforms and so that external changes are picked up sooner. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4499[*OCPBUGS-4499*])

* Previously, due to a deployment misconfiguration for the Cluster Machine Approver Operator, enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set caused errors and sporadic Operator degradation. Because clusters with the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set enabled use two instances of the Cluster Machine Approver Operator and both deployments used the same set of ports, there was a conflict that lead to errors for single-node topology. With this release, the Cluster Machine Approver Operator deployment is updated to use a different set of ports for different deployments. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2621[*OCPBUGS-2621*])

* Previously, the scale from zero functionality in Azure relied on a statically compiled list of instance types mapping the name of the instance type to the number of CPUs and the amount of memory allocated to the instance type. This list grew stale over time. With this release, information about instance type sizes is dynamically gathered from the Azure API directly to prevent the list from becoming stale. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2558[*OCPBUGS-2558*])

* Previously, Machine API termination handler pods did not start on spot instances. As a result, pods that were running on tainted spot instances did not receive a termination signal if the instance was terminated. This could result in loss of data in workload applications. With this release, the Machine API termination handler deployment is modified to tolerate the taints and pods running on spot instances with taints now receive termination signals.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1274[*OCPBUGS-1274*])

* Previously, error messages for Azure clusters did not explain that it is not possible to create new machines with public IP addresses for a disconnected install that uses only the internal publish strategy. With this release, the error message is updated for improved clarity. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-519[*OCPBUGS-519*])

* Previously, the Cloud Controller Manager Operator did not check the `cloud-config` configuration file for AWS clusters. As a result, it was not possible to pass additional settings to the AWS cloud controller manager component by using the configuration file. With this release, the Cloud Controller Manager Operator checks the infrastructure resource and parses references to the `cloud-config` configuration file so that users can configure additional settings. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2104373[*BZ#2104373*])

* Previously, when Azure added new instance types and enabled accelerated networking support on instance types that previously did not have it, the list of Azure instances in the machine controller became outdated. As a result, the machine controller could not create machines with instance types that did not previously support accelerated networking, even if they support this feature on Azure. With this release, the required instance type information is retrieved from Azure API before the machine is created to keep it up to date so the machine controller is able to create machines with new and updated instance types. This fix also applies to any instance types that are added in the future. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2108647[*BZ#2108647*])

* Previously, the cluster autoscaler did not respect the AWS, IBM Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud topology labels for the CSI drivers when using the Cluster API provider. As a result, nodes with the topology label were not processed properly by the autoscaler when attempting to balance nodes during a scale-out event. With this release, the autoscaler's custom processors are updated so that it respects this label. The autoscaler can now balance similar node groups that are labeled by the AWS, IBM Cloud, or Alibaba CSI labels. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2001027[*BZ#2001027*])

* Previously, Power VS cloud providers were not capable of fetching the machine IP address from a DHCP server. Changing the IP address did not update the node, which caused some inconsistencies, such as pending certificate signing requests. With this release, the Power VS cloud provider is updated to fetch the machine IP address from the DHCP server so that the IP addresses for the nodes are consistent with the machine IP address. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2111474[*BZ#2111474*])

* Previously, machines created in early versions of {product-title} with invalid configurations could not be deleted. With this release, the webhooks that prevent the creation of machines with invalid configurations no longer prevent the deletion of existing invalid machines. Users can now successfully remove these machines from their cluster by manually removing the finalizers on these machines. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2101736[*BZ#2101736*])

* Previously, short DHCP lease times, caused by `NetworkManager` not being run as a daemon or in continuous mode, caused machines to become stuck during initial provisioning and never become nodes in the cluster. With this release, extra checks are added so that if a machine becomes stuck in this state it is deleted and recreated automatically. Machines that are affected by this network condition can become nodes after a reboot from the Machine API controller. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2115090[*BZ#2115090*])

* Previously, when creating a new `Machine` resource using a machine profile that does not exist in IBM Cloud, the machines became stuck in the `Provisioning` phase. With this release, validation is added to the IBM Cloud Machine API provider to ensure that a machine profile exists, and machines with an invalid machine profile are rejected by the Machine API. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2062579[*BZ#2062579*])

* Previously, the Machine API provider for AWS did not verify that the security group defined in the machine specification exists. Instead of returning an error in this case, it used a default security group, which should not be used for {product-title} machines, and successfully created a machine without informing the user that the default group was used. With this release, the Machine API returns an error when users set either incorrect or empty security group names in the machine specification. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2060068[*BZ#2060068*])

* Previously, the Machine API provider Azure did not treated user-provided values for instance types as case sensitive. This led to false-positive errors when instance types were correct but did not match the case. With this release, instance types are converted to the lowercase characters so that users get correct results without false-positive errors for mismatched case. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2085390[*BZ#2085390*])

* Previously, there was no check for nil values in the annotations of a machine object before attempting to access the object. This situation was rare, but caused the machine controller to panic when reconciling the machine. With this release, nil values are checked and the machine controller is able to reconcile machines without annotations. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2106733[*BZ#2106733*])

* Previously, the cluster autoscaler metrics for cluster CPU and memory usage would never reach, or exceed, the limits set by the `ClusterAutoscaler` resource. As a result, no alerts were fired when the cluster autoscaler could not scale due to resource limitations. With this release, a new metric called `cluster_autoscaler_skipped_scale_events_count` is added to the cluster autoscaler to more accurately detect when resource limits are reached or exceeded. Alerts will now fire when the cluster autoscaler is unable to scale the cluster up because it has reached the cluster resource limits. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1997396[*BZ#1997396*])

* Previously, when the Machine API provider failed to fetch the machine IP address, it would not set the internal DNS name and the machine certificate signing requests were not automatically approved. With this release, the Power VS machine provider is updated to set the server name as the internal DNS name even when it fails to fetch the IP address. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2111467[*BZ#2111467*])

* Previously, the Machine API vSphere machine controller set the `PowerOn` flag when cloning a VM. This created a `PowerOn` task that the machine controller was not aware of. If that `PowerOn` task failed, machines were stuck in the `Provisioned` phase but never powered on. With this release, the cloning sequence is altered to avoid the issue. Additionally, the machine controller now retries powering on the VM in case of failure and reports failures properly. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2087981[*BZ#2087981*], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-954[*OCPBUGS-954*])

* With this release, AWS security groups are tagged immediately instead of after creation. This means that fewer requests are sent to AWS and the required user privileges are lowered. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2098054[*BZ#2098054*], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3094[*OCPBUGS-3094*])

* Previously, the number of supported user-defined tags was 8, and reserved {product-title} tags were 2 for AWS resources. With this release, the number of supported user-defined tags is now 25 and reserved {product-title} tags are 25 for AWS resources. You can now add up to 25 user tags during installation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CFE-592[*CFE#592*])

* Previously, installing a cluster on Microsoft Azure failed when the Azure DCasv5-series or DCadsv5-series of confidential VMs were specified as control plane nodes. With this update, the installation program now stops the installation with an error, which states that confidential VMs are not yet supported. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2055247[*BZ#2055247*])

* Previously, gathering bootstrap logs was not possible until the control plane machines were running. With this update, gathering bootstrap logs now only requires that the bootstrap machine be available. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2105341[*BZ#2105341*])

* Previously, if a cluster failed to install on Google Cloud Platform because the service account had insufficient permissions, the resulting error message did not mention this as the cause of the failure. This update improves the error message, which now instructs users to check the permissions that are assigned to the service account. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2103236[*BZ#2103236*])

* Previously, when an installation on Google Cloud provider (GCP) failed because an invalid GCP region was specified, the resulting error message did not mention this as the cause of the failure. This update improves the error message, which now states the region is not valid. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102324[*BZ#2102324*])

* Previously, cluster installations using Hive could fail if Hive used an older version of the install-config.yaml file. This update allows the installer to accept older versions of the `install-config.yaml` file provided by Hive. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2098299[*BZ#2098299*])

* Previously, the installation program would incorrectly allow the `apiVIP` and `ingressVIP` parameters to use the same IPv6 address if they represented the address differently, such as listing the address in an abbreviated format. In this update, the installer correctly validates these two parameters regardless of their formatting, requiring separate IP addresses for each parameter. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2103144[*BZ#2103144*])

* Previously, uninstalling a cluster using the installation program failed to delete all resources in clusters installed on GCP if the cluster name was more than 22 characters long. In this update, uninstalling a cluster using the installation program correctly locates and deletes all GCP cluster resources in cases of long cluster names. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2076646[*BZ#2076646*])

* Previously, when installing a cluster on {rh-openstack-first} with multiple networks defined in the `machineNetwork` parameter, the installation program only created security group rules for the first network. With this update, the installation program creates security group rules for all networks defined in the `machineNetwork` so that users no longer need to manually edit security group rules after installation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2095323[*BZ#2095323*])

* Previously, users could manually set the API and Ingress virtual IP addresses to values that conflicted with the allocation pool of the DHCP server when installing a cluster on OpenStack. This could cause the DHCP server to assign one of the VIP addresses to a new machine, which would fail to start. In this update, the installation program validates the user-provided VIP addresses to ensure that they do not conflict with any DHCP pools. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1944365[*BZ1944365*])

* Previously, when installing a cluster on vSphere using a datacenter that is embedded inside a folder, the installation program could not locate the datacenter object, causing the installation to fail. In this update, the installation program can traverse the directory that contains the datacenter object, allowing the installation to succeed.

* Previously, the *Operator details* page attempted to display multiple error messages, but the error message component can only display a single error message at a time. As a result, relevant error messages were not displayed. With this update, the *Operator details* page displays only the first error message so the user sees a relevant error. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3927[*OCPBUGS-3927*])

* Previously, the product name for Azure Red Hat OpenShift was incorrect in Customer Case Management (CCM). As a result, the console had to use the same incorrect product name to correctly populate the fields in CCM. Once the product name in CCM was updated, the console needed to be updated as well. With this update, the same, correct product name as CCM is correctly populated with the correct Azure product name when following the link from the console. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-869[*OCPBUGS-869*])

* Previously, when a plug-in page resulted in an error, the error did not reset when navigating away from the error page, and the error persisted after navigating to a page that was not the cause of the error. With this update, the error state is reset to its default when a user navigates to a new page, and the error no longer persists after navigating to a new page. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2117738[*BZ#2117738*], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-523[*OCPBUGS-523*])

* Previously, the *_View it here_* link in the *Operator details* pane for installed Operators was incorrectly built when *_All Namespaces_* was selected. As a result, the link attempted to navigate to the *Operator details* page for a cluster service version (CSV) in *All Projects*, which is an invalid route. With this update, the *_View it here_* link to use the namespace where the CSV is installed now builds correctly and the link works as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-184[*OCPBUGS-184*])

* Previously, line numbers with more than five digits resulted in a cosmetic issue where the line number overlays the vertical divider between the line number and the line contents making it harder to read. With this update, the amount of space available for line numbers was increased to account for longer line numbers, and the line number no longer overlays the vertical divider. (link: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-183[*OCPBUGS-183*])

* Previously, in the administrator perspective of the web console, the link to *_Learn more about the OpenShift local update services_* on the *Default update server* pop-up window in the *Cluster Settings* page produced a 404 error. With this update, the link works as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2098234[*BZ#2098234*])

* Previously, the `MatchExpression` component did not account for array-type values. As a result,  only single values could be entered through forms using this component. With this update, the `MatchExpression` component accepts comma-separated values as an array. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2079690[*BZ#207690*])

* Previously, there were redundant checks for the model resulting in tab reloading which occasionally resulted in a flickering of the tab contents where they rerendered. With this update, the redundant model check was removed, and the model is only checked once. As a result, the tab contents do not flicker and no longer rerender.

==== Monitoring

* Before this update, Alertmanager pod startup might time out because of slow DNS resolution, and the Alertmanager pods would not start. With this release, the timeout value has been increased to seven minutes, which prevents pod startup from timing out. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2083226[*BZ#2083226*])

* Before this update, if Prometheus Operator failed to run or schedule Prometheus pods, the system provided no underlying reason for the failure. With this update, if Prometheus pods are not run or scheduled, the Cluster Monitoring Operator updates the `clusterOperator` monitoring status with a reason for the failure, which can be used to troubleshoot the underlying issue. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2043518[*BZ#2043518*])

* Before this update, if you created an alert silence from the *Developer* perspective in the {product-title} web console, external labels were included that did not match the alert. Therefore, the alert would not be silenced. With this update, external labels are now excluded when you create a silence in the *Developer* perspective so that newly created silences function as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2084504[*BZ#2084504*])

* Previously, if you enabled an instance of Alertmanager dedicated to user-defined projects, a misconfiguration could occur in certain circumstances, and you would not be informed that the user-defined project Alertmanager config map settings did not load for either the main instance of Alertmanager or the instance dedicated to user-defined projects. With this release, if this misconfiguration occurs, the Cluster Monitoring Operator now displays a message that informs you of the issue and provides resolution steps. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2099939[*BZ#2099939*])

* Before this update, if the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) failed to update Prometheus, the CMO did not verify whether a previous deployment was running and would report that cluster monitoring was unavailable even if one of the Prometheus pods was still running. With this update, the CMO now checks for running Prometheus pods in this situation and reports that cluster monitoring is unavailable only if no Prometheus pods are running. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2039411[*BZ#2039411*])

* Before this update, if you configured OpsGenie as an alert receiver, a warning would appear in the log that `api_key` and `api_key_file` are mutually exclusive and that `api_key` takes precedence. This warning appeared even if you had not defined `api_key_file`. With this update, this warning only appears in the log if you have defined both `api_key` and `api_key_file`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2093892[*BZ#2093892*])

* Before this update the Telemeter Client (TC) only loaded new pull secrets when it was manually restarted. Therefore, if a pull secret had been changed or updated and the TC had not been restarted, the TC would fail to authenticate with the server. This update addresses the issue so that when the secret is rotated, the deployment is automatically restarted and uses the updated token to authenticate.

[id="ocp-4-12-networking-bug-fixes"]
==== Networking

* Previously, routers that were in the terminating state delayed the `oc cp` command which would delay the `oc adm must-gather` command until the pod was terminated. With this update, a timeout for each issued `oc cp` command is set to prevent delaying the `must-gather` command from running. As a result, terminating pods no longer delay `must-gather` commands. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2103283[*BZ#2103283*])

* Previously, an Ingress Controller could not be configured with both the `Private` endpoint publishing strategy type and PROXY protocol. With this update, users can now configure an Ingress Controller with both the `Private` endpoint publishing strategy type and PROXY protocol. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2104481[*BZ#2104481*])

* Previously, the `routeSelector` parameter cleared the route status of the Ingress Controller prior to the router deployment. Because of this, the route status repopulated incorrectly. To avoid using stale data, route status detection has been updated to no longer rely on the Kubernetes object cache. Additionally, this update includes a fix to check the generation ID on route deployment in order to determine the route status. As a result, the route status is consistently cleared with a `routeSelector` update. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2101878[*BZ#2101878*])

* Previously, a cluster that was upgraded from a version of {product-title} earlier than 4.8 could have orphaned `Route` objects. This was caused by earlier versions of {product-title} translating `Ingress` objects into `Route` objects irrespective of a given `Ingress` object's indicated `IngressClass`. With this update, an alert is sent to the cluster administrator about any orphaned Route objects still present in the cluster after Ingress-to-Route translation. This update also adds another alert that notifies the cluster administrator about any Ingress objects that do not specify an `IngressClass`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1962502[*BZ#1962502*])

* Previously, if a `configmap` that the router deployment depends on is not created, then the router deployment does not progress. With this update, the cluster Operator reports `ingress progressing=true` if the default ingress controller deployment is progressing. This results in users debugging issues with the ingress controller by using the command `oc get co`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2066560[*BZ#2066560*])

* With this update, CoreDNS has been updated to version 1.10.0, which is based on Kubernetes 1.25. This keeps both the CoreDNS version and {product-title} {product-version}, which is also based on Kubernetes 1.25, in alignment with one another. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1731[*OCPBUGS-1731*])

* With this update, the {product-title} router now uses `k8s.io/client-go` version 1.25.2, which supports Kubernetes 1.25. This keeps both the `openshift-router` and {product-title} {product-version}, which is also based on Kubernetes 1.25, in alignment with one another. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1730[*OCPBUGS-1730*])

* With this update, the Ingress Operator now uses `k8s.io/client-go` version 1.25.2, which supports Kubernetes 1.25. This keeps both the Ingress Operator and {product-title} {product-version}, which is also based on Kubernetes 1.25, in alignment with one another. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1554[*OCPBUGS-1554*])

* Previously, the DNS Operator did not reconcile the `openshift-dns` namespace. Because {product-title} {product-version} requires the `openshift-dns` namespace to have pod-security labels, this caused the namespace to be missing those labels upon cluster update. Without the pod-security labels, the pods failed to start. With this update, the DNS Operator now reconciles the `openshift-dns` namespace, and the pod-security labels are now present. As a result, pods start up as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1549[*OCPBUGS-1549*])

* Previously, the `ingresscontroller.spec.tuniningOptions.reloadInterval` did not support decimal numerals as valid parameter values because the Ingress Operator internally converts the specified value into milliseconds, which was not a supported time unit. This prevented an Ingress Controller from being deleted. With this update, `ingresscontroller.spec.tuningOptions.reloadInterval` now supports decimal numerals and users can delete Ingress Controllers with `reloadInterval` parameter values which were previously unsupported.

== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.8 and beyond! This needs some SME/QE review before being updated for 4.11. Need to check if KI should be removed or should stay.
* In {product-title} 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.
+
If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.1 to 4.8, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. Unless there is a specific need for unauthenticated access, you should revoke it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP `403` errors if you revoke unauthenticated access.
====
+
Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:
+
[source,bash]
----
## Snippet to remove unauthenticated group from all the cluster role bindings
$ for clusterrolebinding in cluster-status-binding discovery system:basic-user system:discovery system:openshift:discovery ;
do
### Find the index of unauthenticated group in list of subjects
index=$(oc get clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} -o json | jq 'select(.subjects!=null) | .subjects | map(.name=="system:unauthenticated") | index(true)');
### Remove the element at index from subjects array
oc patch clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} --type=json --patch "[{'op': 'remove','path': '/subjects/$index'}]";
done
----
+
This script removes unauthenticated subjects from the following cluster role bindings:
+
--
** `cluster-status-binding`
** `discovery`
** `system:basic-user`
** `system:discovery`
** `system:openshift:discovery`
--
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821771[*BZ#1821771*])

// TODO: This known issue should be removed when RHCOS images begin using RHEL 9. RHEL 9 prevents this issue from occurring.
* Intermittently, an IBM Cloud VPC cluster might fail to install because some worker machines do not start. Rather, these worker machines remain in the `Provisioned` phase.
+
There is a workaround for this issue. From the host where you performed the initial installation, delete the failed machines and run the installation program again.
+
. Verify that the status of the internal application load balancer (ALB) for the master API server is `active`.
.. Identify the cluster's infrastructure ID by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get infrastructure/cluster -ojson | jq -r '.status.infrastructureName'
----
.. Log into the IBM Cloud account for your cluster and target the correct region for your cluster.
.. Verify that the internal ALB status is `active` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ibmcloud is lb <cluster_ID>-kubernetes-api-private  --output json | jq -r '.provisioning_status'
----
. Identify the machines that are in the `Provisioned` phase by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machine -n openshift-machine-api
----
+

(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1327[*OCPBUGS#1327*])

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.9 and beyond!
* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])

* Due to the inclusion of old images in some image indexes, running `oc adm catalog mirror` and `oc image mirror` might result in the following error: `error: unable to retrieve source image`. As a temporary workaround, you can use the `--skip-missing` option to bypass the error and continue downloading the image index. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6975305[Service Mesh Operator mirroring failed].

* There is a known issue with Nutanix installation where the installation fails if you use 4096-bit certificates with Prism Central 2022.x. Instead, use 2048-bit certificates. (link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6976743[*KCS*])

* Deleting the bidirectional forwarding detection (BFD) profile and removing the `bfdProfile` added to the border gateway protocol (BGP) peer resource does not disable the BFD. Instead, the BGP peer starts using the default BFD profile. To disable BFD from a BGP peer resource, delete the BGP peer configuration and recreate it without a BFD profile. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2050824[*BZ#2050824*])

* Due to an unresolved metadata API issue, you cannot install clusters that use bare-metal workers on {rh-openstack} 16.1. Clusters on {rh-openstack} 16.2 are not impacted by this issue. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2033953[*BZ#2033953*])

== Asynchronous errata updates

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for {product-title} {product-version} are released as asynchronous errata through the Red Hat Network. All {product-title} {product-version} errata is https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[available on the Red Hat Customer Portal]. See the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} Life Cycle] for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account settings for Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications are enabled, users are notified through email whenever new errata relevant to their registered systems are released.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming {product-title} entitlements for {product-title} errata notification emails to generate.
====

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of {product-title} {product-version}. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form {product-title} {product-version}.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.

[IMPORTANT]
