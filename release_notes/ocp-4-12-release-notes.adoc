[id="ocp-4-12-custom-scheduler"]
==== Support for manually deploying a custom scheduler has been removed

Support for deploying custom schedulers manually has been removed with this release.

[id="ocp-4-12-openshiftsdn-sno-not-supported"]
==== Support for deploying {sno} with OpenShiftSDN has been removed

Support for deploying {sno} clusters with OpenShiftSDN has been removed with this release. OVN-Kubernetes is the default networking solution for {sno} deployments.

==== Removal of Jenkins images from install payload

* {product-title} 4.11 moves the "OpenShift Jenkins" and "OpenShift Agent Base" images to the `ocp-tools-4` repository at `registry.redhat.io` so that Red Hat can produce and update the images outside the {product-title} lifecycle. Previously, these images were in the {product-title} install payload and the `openshift4` repository at `registry.redhat.io`. For more information, see xref:../cicd/jenkins/important-changes-to-openshift-jenkins-images.adoc#openshift-jenkins[OpenShift Jenkins].

* {product-title} 4.11 removes "OpenShift Jenkins Maven" and "NodeJS Agent" images from its payload. Previously, {product-title} 4.10 deprecated these images. Red Hat no longer produces these images, and they are not available from the `ocp-tools-4` repository at `registry.redhat.io`.
+
However, upgrading to {product-title} 4.11 does not remove "OpenShift Jenkins Maven" and "NodeJS Agent" images from 4.10 and earlier releases. And Red Hat provides bug fixes and support for these images through the end of the 4.10 release lifecycle, in accordance with the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} lifecycle policy].
+
For more information, see xref:../cicd/jenkins/important-changes-to-openshift-jenkins-images.adoc#openshift-jenkins[OpenShift Jenkins].

[id="ocp-4-12-future-removals"]
=== Future Kubernetes API removals

The next minor release of {product-title} is expected to use Kubernetes 1.25. Currently, Kubernetes 1.25 is scheduled to remove several deprecated `v1beta1` and `v2beta1` APIs.

See the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-25[Deprecated API Migration Guide] in the upstream Kubernetes documentation for the list of planned Kubernetes API removals.

See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6955985[Navigating Kubernetes API deprecations and removals] for information about how to check your cluster for Kubernetes APIs that are planned for removal.

== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.8 and beyond! This needs some SME/QE review before being updated for 4.11. Need to check if KI should be removed or should stay.
* In {product-title} 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.
+
If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.1 to 4.8, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. Unless there is a specific need for unauthenticated access, you should revoke it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP `403` errors if you revoke unauthenticated access.
====
+
Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:
+
[source,bash]
----
## Snippet to remove unauthenticated group from all the cluster role bindings
$ for clusterrolebinding in cluster-status-binding discovery system:basic-user system:discovery system:openshift:discovery ;
do
### Find the index of unauthenticated group in list of subjects
index=$(oc get clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} -o json | jq 'select(.subjects!=null) | .subjects | map(.name=="system:unauthenticated") | index(true)');
### Remove the element at index from subjects array
oc patch clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} --type=json --patch "[{'op': 'remove','path': '/subjects/$index'}]";
done
----
+
This script removes unauthenticated subjects from the following cluster role bindings:
+
--
** `cluster-status-binding`
** `discovery`
** `system:basic-user`
** `system:discovery`
** `system:openshift:discovery`
--

(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821771[*BZ#1821771*])

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.9 and beyond!
* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])

[id="ocp-4-12-asynchronous-errata-updates"]
== Asynchronous errata updates

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for {product-title} {product-version} are released as asynchronous errata through the Red Hat Network. All {product-title} {product-version} errata is https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[available on the Red Hat Customer Portal]. See the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} Life Cycle] for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account settings for Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications are enabled, users are notified through email whenever new errata relevant to their registered systems are released.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming {product-title} entitlements for {product-title} errata notification emails to generate.
====

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of {product-title} {product-version}. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form {product-title} {product-version}.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.
