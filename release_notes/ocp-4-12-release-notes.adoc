[id="ocp-4-12-new-features-and-enhancements"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

[id="ocp-4-12-rhcos"]
=== {op-system-first}

[id="ocp-4-12-default-graphical-console"]
==== Default consoles for new clusters are now determined by the installation platform
{op-system-first} nodes installed from an {product-title} {product-version} boot image now use a platform-specific default console. The default consoles on cloud platforms correspond to the specific system consoles expected by that cloud provider. VMware and OpenStack images now use a primary graphical console and a secondary serial console. Other bare metal installations now use only the graphical console by default, and do not enable a serial console. Installations performed with `coreos-installer` can override existing defaults and enable the serial console.

Existing nodes are not affected. New nodes on existing clusters are not likely to be affected because they are typically installed from the boot image that was originally used to install the cluster.

For information about how to enable the serial console, see the following documentation:

* xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.adoc#installation-user-infra-machines-advanced-console-configuration_installing-bare-metal[Default console configuration].

* xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.adoc#installation-user-infra-machines-advanced-customizing-live-iso-serial-console_installing-bare-metal[Modifying a live install ISO image to enable the serial console].

* xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.adoc#installation-user-infra-machines-advanced-customizing-live-pxe-serial-console_installing-bare-metal[Modifying a live install PXE environment to enable the serial console].

[id="ocp-4-12-secure-execution-z-linux-one"]
==== IBM Secure Execution on {ibmzProductName} and LinuxONE (Technology Preview)
{product-title} now supports configuring {op-system-first} nodes for IBM Secure Execution on {ibmzProductName} and LinuxONE (s390x architecture) as a Technology Preview feature. IBM Secure Execution is a hardware enhancement that protects memory boundaries for KVM guests. IBM Secure Execution provides the highest level of isolation and security for cluster workloads, and you can enable it by using an IBM Secure Execution-ready QCOW2 boot image.

To use IBM Secure Execution, you must have host keys for your host machine(s) and they must be specified in your Ignition configuration file. IBM Secure Execution automatically encrypts your boot volumes using LUKS encryption.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_ibm_z/installing-ibm-z-kvm.adoc#installing-rhcos-using-ibm-secure-execution_installing-ibm-z-kvm[Installing {op-system} using IBM Secure Execution].

[id="ocp-4-12-installation-and-upgrade"]
=== Installation and upgrade

[id="ocp-4-12-aws-load-balancer-customization"]
==== Specify the load balancer type in AWS during installation
Beginning with {product-title} {product-version}, you can specify either Network Load Balancer (NLB) or Classic as a persistent load balancer type in AWS during installation. Afterwards, if an Ingress Controller is deleted, the load balancer type persists with the lbType configured during installation.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-network-customizations.adoc[Installing a cluster on AWS with network customizations].

[id="ocp-4-12-installation-and-upgrade-gcp-marketplace"]
==== Google Cloud Platform Marketplace offering
{product-title} is now available on the GCP Marketplace. Installing an {product-title} with a GCP Marketplace image lets you create self-managed cluster deployments that are billed on pay-per-use basis (hourly, per core) through GCP, while still being supported directly by Red Hat.

For more information about installing using installer-provisioned infrastructure, see xref:../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-customizations.adoc#installation-gcp-marketplace_installing-gcp-customizations[Using a GCP Marketplace image]. For more information about installing a using user-provisioned infrastructure, see xref:../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-user-infra.adoc#installation-creating-gcp-worker_installing-gcp-user-infra[Creating additional worker machines in GCP].

[id="ocp-4-12-gcp-azure-serial-console-logs"]
==== Troubleshooting bootstrap failures during installation on GCP and Azure
The installer now gathers serial console logs from the bootstrap and control plane hosts on GCP and Azure. This log data is added to the standard bootstrap log bundle.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing-troubleshooting.adoc#installation-bootstrap-gather_installing-troubleshooting[Troubleshooting installation issues].

[id="ocp-4-12-ibm-cloud-vpc"]
==== IBM Cloud VPC general availability
IBM Cloud VPC is now generally available in {product-title} {product-version}.

For more information about installing a cluster, see xref:../installing/installing_ibm_cloud_public/preparing-to-install-on-ibm-cloud.adoc#preparing-to-install-on-ibm-cloud[Preparing to install on IBM Cloud VPC].

[id="ocp-4-12-admin-ack-upgrading"]
==== Required administrator acknowledgment when upgrading from {product-title} 4.11 to 4.12

{product-title} 4.12 uses Kubernetes 1.25, which removed xref:../release_notes/ocp-4-12-release-notes.adoc#ocp-4-12-removed-kube-1-25-apis[several deprecated APIs].

A cluster administrator must provide a manual acknowledgment before the cluster can be upgraded from {product-title} 4.11 to 4.12. This is to help prevent issues after upgrading to {product-title} 4.12, where APIs that have been removed are still in use by workloads, tools, or other components running on or interacting with the cluster. Administrators must evaluate their cluster for any APIs in use that will be removed and migrate the affected components to use the appropriate new API version. After this is done, the administrator can provide the administrator acknowledgment.

All {product-title} 4.11 clusters require this administrator acknowledgment before they can be upgraded to {product-title} 4.12.

For more information, see xref:../updating/updating-cluster-prepare.adoc#updating-cluster-prepare[Preparing to update to {product-title} 4.12].

[id="ocp-4-12-feature-set"]
==== Enabling a feature set when installing a cluster
Beginning with {product-title} {product-version}, you can enable a feature set as part of the installation process. A feature set is a collection of {product-title} features that are not enabled by default.

For more information about enabling a feature set during installation, see xref:../nodes/clusters/nodes-cluster-enabling-features.adoc#nodes-cluster-enabling[Enabling {product-title} features using feature gates].

[id="ocp-4-12-arm-on-azure"]
==== {product-title} on ARM

For more information, see xref:../installing/disconnected_install/installing-mirroring-disconnected.adoc#oc-mirror-oci-format_installing-mirroring-disconnected[Mirroring file-based catalog Operator images in OCI format].

[id="ocp-4-12-consistent-address-for-ironicapi"]
==== Consistent IP address for Ironic API in bare-metal installations without a provisioning network
With this update, in bare-metal installations without a provisioning network, the Ironic API service is accessible through a proxy server. This proxy server provides a consistent IP address for the Ironic API service. If the Metal3 pod that contains `metal3-ironic` relocates to another pod, the consistent proxy address ensures constant communication with the Ironic API service.

[id="ocp-4-12-gcp-service-account-installation"]
==== Installing {product-title} on GCP using service account authentication
In {product-title} {product-version}, you can install a cluster on GCP using a virtual machine with a service account attached to it. This allows you to perform an installation without needing to use a service account JSON file.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-account.adoc#installation-gcp-service-account_installing-gcp-account[Creating a GCP service account].

[id="ocp-4-12-aws-user-tag"]
==== `propagateUserTags` parameter for AWS resources provisioned by the {product-title} cluster
In {product-title} {product-version}, the `propagateUserTags` parameter is a flag that directs in-cluster Operators to include the specified user tags in the tags of the AWS resources that the Operators create.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-network-customizations.html#installation-configuration-parameters_installing-aws-network-customizations[Optional configuration parameters].

[id="ocp-4-12-ironic-base-image-rhel-9"]
==== Ironic container images use RHEL 9 base image
In earlier versions of {product-title}, Ironic container images used {op-system-base-full} 8 as the base image. From {product-title} {product-version}, Ironic container images use {op-system-base} 9 as the base image. The {op-system-base} 9 base image adds support for CentOS Stream 9, Python 3.8, and Python 3.9 in Ironic components.

For more information about the Ironic provisioning service, see xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-overview.adoc[Deploying installer-provisioned clusters on bare metal].

[id="ocp-4-12-nw-aws-load-balancer-operator"]
==== AWS Load Balancer Operator

In {product-title} 4.12, the AWS Load Balancer controller now implements the Kubernetes Ingress specification for multiple matches. If multiple paths within an Ingress match a request, the longest matching path takes the precedence. If two paths still match, paths with an exact path type take precedence over a prefix path type.

The AWS Load Balancer Operator sets the `EnableIPTargetType` feature gate to `false`. The AWS Load Balancer controller disables the support for services and ingress resources for `target-type` `ip`.

The upstream version of `aws-load-balancer-controller` for an {product-title} 4.12 is v2.4.4.

[id="overriding-default-node-ip-selection-logic"]
==== Node IP selection improvements

Previously, the `nodeip-configuration` service on a cluster host selected the IP address from the interface that the default route used. If multiple routes were present, the service would select the route with the lowest metric value. As a result, network traffic could be distributed from the incorrect interface.

With {product-title} 4.12, a new interface has been added to the `nodeip-configuration` service, which allows users to create a hint file. The hint file contains a variable, `NODEIP_HINT`, that overrides the default IP selection logic and selects a specific node IP address from the subnet `NODEIP_HINT` variable. Using the `NODEIP_HINT` variable allows users to specify which IP address is used, ensuring that network traffic is distributed from the correct interface.

For more information, see xref:../support/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-network-issues.adoc#overriding-default-node-ip-selection-logic_troubleshooting-network-issues[Optional: Overriding the default node IP selection logic].

With this update, in installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters, the `ingressVIP` and `apiVIP` configuration settings in the `install-config.yaml` file are deprecated. Instead, use the `ingressVIPs` and `apiVIPs` configuration settings. These settings support dual-stack networking for applications that require IPv4 and IPv6 access to the cluster by using the Ingress VIP and API VIP services. The `ingressVIPs` and `apiVIPs` configuration settings use a list format to specify an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, or both IP address formats. The order of the list indicates the primary and secondary VIP address for each service. The primary IP address must be from the IPv4 network when using dual stack networking.

==== Changes to alerting rules

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat does not guarantee backward compatibility for recording rules or alerting rules.
====

* *New*
** Added the `TelemeterClientFailures` alert, which triggers when a cluster tries and fails to submit Telemetry data at a certain rate over a period of time. The alert fires when the rate of failed requests reaches 20% of the total rate of requests within a 15-minute window.
* *Changed*
** The `KubeAggregatedAPIDown` alert now waits 900 seconds rather than 300 seconds before sending a notification.
** The `NodeClockNotSynchronising` and `NodeClockSkewDetected` alerts now only evaluate metrics from the `node-exporter` job.
** The `NodeRAIDDegraded` and `NodeRAIDDiskFailure` alerts now include a device label filter to match only the value returned by `mmcblk.p.+|nvme.+|sd.+|vd.+|xvd.+|dm-.+|dasd.+`.
** The `PrometheusHighQueryLoad` and `ThanosQueryOverload` alerts now also trigger when a high querying load exists on the query layer.

[id="ocp-4-12-monitoring-new-option-to-improve-data-consistency-for-prometheus-adapter"]
==== New option to improve data consistency for Prometheus Adapter
You can now configure an optional kubelet service monitor for Prometheus Adapter (PA) that improves data consistency across multiple autoscaling requests.
Enabling this service monitor eliminates the possibility that two queries sent at the same time to PA might yield different results because the underlying PromQL queries executed by PA might be on different Prometheus servers.

[id="ocp-4-12-monitoring-update-to-alertmanager-configuration-for-additional-secret-keys"]
==== Update to Alertmanager configuration for additional secret keys
With this release, if you configure an Alertmanager secret to hold additional keys and if the Alertmanager configuration references these keys as files (such as templates, TLS certificates, or tokens), your configuration settings must point to these keys by using an absolute path rather than a relative path.
These keys are available under the `/etc/alertmanager/config` directory.
In earlier releases of {product-title}, you could use relative paths in your configuration to point to these keys because the Alertmanager configuration file was located in the same directory as the keys.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are upgrading to {product-title} {product-version} and have specified relative paths for additional Alertmanager secret keys that are referenced as files, you must change these relative paths to absolute paths in your Alertmanager configuration.
Otherwise, alert receivers that use the files will fail to deliver notifications.

=== Scalability and performance

[id="ocp-4-12-rsp-workload-hints"]
==== Disabling realtime using workload hints removes Receive Packet Steering from the cluster
At the cluster level by default, a systemd service sets a Receive Packet Steering (RPS) mask for virtual network interfaces. The RPS mask routes interrupt requests from virtual network interfaces according to the list of reserved CPUs defined in the performance profile. At the container level, a `CRI-O` hook script also sets an RPS mask for all virtual network devices.

With this update, if you set `spec.workloadHints.realTime` in the performance profile to `False`, the system also disables both the systemd service and the `CRI-O` hook script which set the RPS mask. The system disables these RPS functions because RPS is typically relevant to use cases requiring low-latency, realtime workloads only.

To retain RPS functions even when you set `spec.workloadHints.realTime` to `False`, see the _RPS Settings_ section of the Red Hat Knowledgebase solution link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5532341[Performance addons operator advanced configuration].

=== Hosted control planes (Technology Preview)

[id="ocp-4-12-hcp-api"]
==== HyperShift API beta release now available

The default version for the `hypershift.openshift.io` API, which is the API for hosted control planes on {product-title}, is now v1beta1. Currently, for an existing cluster, the move from alpha to beta is not supported.

[id="ocp-4-12-hcp-versioning"]
==== Versioning for hosted control planes

With each major, minor, or patch version release of {product-title}, the HyperShift Operator is released. The HyperShift command-line interface (CLI) is released as part of each HyperShift Operator release.

The `HostedCluster` and `NodePool` API resources are available in the beta version of the API and follow a similar policy to xref:../rest_api/understanding-api-support-tiers.adoc[{product-title}] and link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/[Kubernetes].

[id="ocp-4-12-rhv"]
=== Red Hat Virtualization (RHV)

* With this update, the oVirt CSI driver logging was revised with new error messages to improve the clarity and readability of the logs.
* Previously, you had to restart the cluster API provider when the credentials changed. With this release, the cluster API provider automatically updates oVirt and Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) credentials when they are changed in {product-title}.

[id="ocp-4-12-psa-restricted-enforcement"]
=== Future restricted enforcement for pod security admission

Currently, pod security violations are shown as warnings and logged in the audit logs, but do not cause the pod to be rejected.

Global restricted enforcement for pod security admission is currently planned for the next minor release of {product-title}. When this restricted enforcement is enabled, pods with pod security violations will be rejected.

To prepare for this upcoming change, ensure that your workloads match the pod security admission profile that applies to them. Workloads that are not configured according to the enforced security standards defined globally or at the namespace level will be rejected. The `restricted-v2` SCC admits workloads according to the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#restricted[Restricted] Kubernetes definition.

If you are receiving pod security violations, see the following resources:

* See xref:../authentication/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission.adoc#security-context-constraints-psa-alert-eval_understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission[Identifying pod security violations] for information about how to find which workloads are causing pod security violations.

* See xref:../authentication/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission.adoc#security-context-constraints-psa-synchronization_understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission[Security context constraint synchronization with pod security standards] to understand when pod security admission label synchronization is performed. Pod security admission labels are not synchronized in certain situations, such as the following situations:
** The workload is running in a system-created namespace that is prefixed with `openshift-`.
** The workload is running on a pod that was created directly without a pod controller.

* If necessary, you can set a custom admission profile on the namespace or pod by setting the `pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce` label.

== Bug fixes

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-12-api-auth-bug-fixes"]
==== API Server and Authentication

* Previously, the Cluster Authentication Operator state was set to `progressing = false` after receiving a `workloadIsBeingUpdatedTooLong` error. At the same time, `degraded = false` was kept for the time of the `inertia` defined. Consequently, the shortened amount of progressing and increased time of degradedation would create a situation where `progressing = false` and `degraded = false` were set prematurely. This caused inconsistent OpenShift CI tests because a healthy state was assumed, which was incorrect. This issue has been fixed by removing the `progressing = false` setting after the `workloadIsBeingUpdatedTooLong` error is returned. Now, because there is no `progressing = false` state, OpenShift CI tests are more consistent. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2111842[*BZ2111842*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-12-bare-metal-hardware-bug-fixes"]
==== Bare Metal Hardware Provisioning

* In recent versions of server firmware the time between server operations has increased. This causes timeouts during installer-provisioned infrastructure installations when the {product-title} installation program waits for a response from the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC). The new `python3-sushy` release increases the number of server side attempts to contact the BMC. This update accounts for the extended waiting time and avoids timeouts during installation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4097[*OCPBUGS-4097*])

* Before this update, the Ironic provisioning service did not support Baseboard Management Controllers (BMC) that use weak eTags combined with strict eTag validation. By design, if the BMC provides a weak eTag, Ironic returns two eTags: the original eTag and the original eTag converted to the strong format for compatibility with BMC that do not support weak eTags. Although Ironic can send two eTags, BMC using strict eTag validation rejects such requests due to the presence of the second eTag. As a result, on some older server hardware, bare-metal provisioning failed with the following error: `HTTP 412 Precondition Failed`. In {product-title} 4.12 and later, this behavior changes and Ironic no longer attempts to send two eTags in cases where a weak eTag is provided. Instead, if a Redfish request dependent on an eTag fails with an eTag validation error, Ironic retries the request with known workarounds. This minimizes the risk of bare-metal provisioning failures on machines with strict eTag validation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3479[*OCPBUGS-3479*])

* Before this update, when a Redfish system features a Settings URI, the Ironic provisioning service always attempts to use this URI to make changes to boot related BIOS settings. However, bare-metal provisioning fails if the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) features a Settings URI but does not support changing a particular BIOS setting by using this Settings URI. In {product-title} 4.12 and later, if a system features a Settings URI, Ironic verifies that it can change a particular BIOS setting by using the Settings URI before proceeding. Otherwise, Ironic implements the change by using the System URI. This additional logic ensures that Ironic can apply boot-related BIOS setting changes and bare-metal provisioning can succeed.

[id="ocp-4-12-builds-bug-fixes"]
==== Builds

* By default, Buildah prints steps to the log file, including the contents of environment variables, which might include xref:../cicd/builds/creating-build-inputs.adoc#builds-input-secrets-configmaps_creating-build-inputs[build input secrets]. Although you can use the `--quiet` build argument to suppress printing of those environment variables, this argument isn't available if you use the source-to-image (S2I) build strategy. The current release fixes this issue. To suppress printing of environment variables, set the `BUILDAH_QUIET` environment variable in your build configuration:

[id="ocp-4-12-cloud-compute-bug-fixes"]
==== Cloud Compute

* Previously, instances were not set to respect the GCP infrastructure default option for automated restarts. As a result, instances could be created without using the infrastructure default for automatic restarts. This sometimes meant that instances were terminated in GCP but their associated machines were still listed in the `Running` state because they did not automatically restart. With this release, the code for passing the automatic restart option has been improved to better detect and pass on the default option selection from users. Instances now use the infrastructure default properly and are automatically restarted when the user requests the default functionality. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4504[*OCPBUGS-4504*])

* The `v1beta1` version of the `PodDisruptionBudget` object is now deprecated in Kubernetes. With this release, internal references to `v1beta1` are replaced with `v1`. This change is internal to the cluster autoscaler and does not require user action beyond the advice in the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6955381[Preparing to upgrade to OpenShift Container Platform 4.12] Red Hat Knowledgebase Article. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1484[*OCPBUGS-1484*])

* Previously, the GCP machine controller reconciled the state of machines every 10 hours. Other providers set this value to 10 minutes so that changes that happen outside of the Machine API system are detected within a short period. The longer reconciliation period for GCP could cause unexpected issues such as missing certificate signing requests (CSR) approvals due to an external IP address being added but not detected for an extended period. With this release, the GCP machine controller is updated to reconcile every 10 minutes to be consistent with other platforms and so that external changes are picked up sooner. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4499[*OCPBUGS-4499*])

* Previously, due to a deployment misconfiguration for the Cluster Machine Approver Operator, enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set caused errors and sporadic Operator degradation. Because clusters with the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set enabled use two instances of the Cluster Machine Approver Operator and both deployments used the same set of ports, there was a conflict that lead to errors for single-node topology. With this release, the Cluster Machine Approver Operator deployment is updated to use a different set of ports for different deployments. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2621[*OCPBUGS-2621*])

* Previously, the scale from zero functionality in Azure relied on a statically compiled list of instance types mapping the name of the instance type to the number of CPUs and the amount of memory allocated to the instance type. This list grew stale over time. With this release, information about instance type sizes is dynamically gathered from the Azure API directly to prevent the list from becoming stale. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2558[*OCPBUGS-2558*])

* Previously, Machine API termination handler pods did not start on spot instances. As a result, pods that were running on tainted spot instances did not receive a termination signal if the instance was terminated. This could result in loss of data in workload applications. With this release, the Machine API termination handler deployment is modified to tolerate the taints and pods running on spot instances with taints now receive termination signals.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1274[*OCPBUGS-1274*])

* Previously, error messages for Azure clusters did not explain that it is not possible to create new machines with public IP addresses for a disconnected install that uses only the internal publish strategy. With this release, the error message is updated for improved clarity. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-519[*OCPBUGS-519*])

* Previously, the Cloud Controller Manager Operator did not check the `cloud-config` configuration file for AWS clusters. As a result, it was not possible to pass additional settings to the AWS cloud controller manager component by using the configuration file. With this release, the Cloud Controller Manager Operator checks the infrastructure resource and parses references to the `cloud-config` configuration file so that users can configure additional settings. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2104373[*BZ#2104373*])

* Previously, when Azure added new instance types and enabled accelerated networking support on instance types that previously did not have it, the list of Azure instances in the machine controller became outdated. As a result, the machine controller could not create machines with instance types that did not previously support accelerated networking, even if they support this feature on Azure. With this release, the required instance type information is retrieved from Azure API before the machine is created to keep it up to date so the machine controller is able to create machines with new and updated instance types. This fix also applies to any instance types that are added in the future. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2108647[*BZ#2108647*])

* Previously, the cluster autoscaler did not respect the AWS, IBM Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud topology labels for the CSI drivers when using the Cluster API provider. As a result, nodes with the topology label were not processed properly by the autoscaler when attempting to balance nodes during a scale-out event. With this release, the autoscaler's custom processors are updated so that it respects this label. The autoscaler can now balance similar node groups that are labeled by the AWS, IBM Cloud, or Alibaba CSI labels. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2001027[*BZ#2001027*])

* Previously, Power VS cloud providers were not capable of fetching the machine IP address from a DHCP server. Changing the IP address did not update the node, which caused some inconsistencies, such as pending certificate signing requests. With this release, the Power VS cloud provider is updated to fetch the machine IP address from the DHCP server so that the IP addresses for the nodes are consistent with the machine IP address. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2111474[*BZ#2111474*])

* Previously, machines created in early versions of {product-title} with invalid configurations could not be deleted. With this release, the webhooks that prevent the creation of machines with invalid configurations no longer prevent the deletion of existing invalid machines. Users can now successfully remove these machines from their cluster by manually removing the finalizers on these machines. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2101736[*BZ#2101736*])

* Previously, short DHCP lease times, caused by `NetworkManager` not being run as a daemon or in continuous mode, caused machines to become stuck during initial provisioning and never become nodes in the cluster. With this release, extra checks are added so that if a machine becomes stuck in this state it is deleted and recreated automatically. Machines that are affected by this network condition can become nodes after a reboot from the Machine API controller. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2115090[*BZ#2115090*])

* Previously, when creating a new `Machine` resource using a machine profile that does not exist in IBM Cloud, the machines became stuck in the `Provisioning` phase. With this release, validation is added to the IBM Cloud Machine API provider to ensure that a machine profile exists, and machines with an invalid machine profile are rejected by the Machine API. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2062579[*BZ#2062579*])

* Previously, the Machine API provider for AWS did not verify that the security group defined in the machine specification exists. Instead of returning an error in this case, it used a default security group, which should not be used for {product-title} machines, and successfully created a machine without informing the user that the default group was used. With this release, the Machine API returns an error when users set either incorrect or empty security group names in the machine specification. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2060068[*BZ#2060068*])

* Previously, the Machine API provider Azure did not treated user-provided values for instance types as case sensitive. This led to false-positive errors when instance types were correct but did not match the case. With this release, instance types are converted to the lowercase characters so that users get correct results without false-positive errors for mismatched case. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2085390[*BZ#2085390*])

* Previously, there was no check for nil values in the annotations of a machine object before attempting to access the object. This situation was rare, but caused the machine controller to panic when reconciling the machine. With this release, nil values are checked and the machine controller is able to reconcile machines without annotations. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2106733[*BZ#2106733*])

* Previously, the cluster autoscaler metrics for cluster CPU and memory usage would never reach, or exceed, the limits set by the `ClusterAutoscaler` resource. As a result, no alerts were fired when the cluster autoscaler could not scale due to resource limitations. With this release, a new metric called `cluster_autoscaler_skipped_scale_events_count` is added to the cluster autoscaler to more accurately detect when resource limits are reached or exceeded. Alerts will now fire when the cluster autoscaler is unable to scale the cluster up because it has reached the cluster resource limits. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1997396[*BZ#1997396*])

* Previously, when the Machine API provider failed to fetch the machine IP address, it would not set the internal DNS name and the machine certificate signing requests were not automatically approved. With this release, the Power VS machine provider is updated to set the server name as the internal DNS name even when it fails to fetch the IP address. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2111467[*BZ#2111467*])

* Previously, the Machine API vSphere machine controller set the `PowerOn` flag when cloning a VM. This created a `PowerOn` task that the machine controller was not aware of. If that `PowerOn` task failed, machines were stuck in the `Provisioned` phase but never powered on. With this release, the cloning sequence is altered to avoid the issue. Additionally, the machine controller now retries powering on the VM in case of failure and reports failures properly. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2087981[*BZ#2087981*], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-954[*OCPBUGS-954*])

* With this release, AWS security groups are tagged immediately instead of after creation. This means that fewer requests are sent to AWS and the required user privileges are lowered. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2098054[*BZ#2098054*], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3094[*OCPBUGS-3094*])

* Previously, a bug in the {rh-openstack} legacy cloud provider resulted in a crash if certain {rh-openstack} operations were attempted after authentication had failed. For example, shutting down a server causes the Kubernetes controller manager to fetch server information from {rh-openstack}, which triggered this bug. As a result, if initial cloud authentication failed or was configured incorrectly, shutting down a server caused the Kubernetes controller manager to crash. With this release, the {rh-openstack} legacy cloud provider is updated to not attempt any {rh-openstack} API calls if it has not previously authenticated successfully. Now, shutting down a server with invalid cloud credentials no longer causes Kubernetes controller manager to crash. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102383[*BZ#2102383*])

* Previously, the `openshift-config` namespace was hardcoded for the `HelmChartRepository` custom resource, which was the same namespace for the `ProjectHelmChartRepository` custom resource. This prevented users from adding private `ProjectHelmChartRepository` custom resources in their desired namespace. Consquently, users were unable to access secrets and configmaps in the `openshift-config` namespace. This update fixes the `ProjectHelmChartRepository` custom resource definition with a `namespace` field that can read the secret and configmaps from a namespace of choice by a user with the correct permissions. Additionally, the user can add secrets and configmaps to the accessible namespace, and they can add private Helm chart repositories in the namespace used the creation resources.

* Previously, the number of supported user-defined tags was 8, and reserved {product-title} tags were 2 for AWS resources. With this release, the number of supported user-defined tags is now 25 and reserved {product-title} tags are 25 for AWS resources. You can now add up to 25 user tags during installation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CFE-592[*CFE#592*])

* Previously, installing a cluster on Amazon Web Services started and then failed when the IAM administrative user was not assigned the `s3:GetBucketPolicy` permission. This update adds this policy to checklist that the installation program uses to ensure that all of the required permissions are assigned. As a result, the installation program now stops the installation with a warning that the IAM administrative user is missing the `s3:GetBucketPolicy` permission. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2109388[*BZ#2109388*])

* Previously, installing a cluster on Microsoft Azure failed when the Azure DCasv5-series or DCadsv5-series of confidential VMs were specified as control plane nodes. With this update, the installation program now stops the installation with an error, which states that confidential VMs are not yet supported. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2055247[*BZ#2055247*])

* Previously, gathering bootstrap logs was not possible until the control plane machines were running. With this update, gathering bootstrap logs now only requires that the bootstrap machine be available. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2105341[*BZ#2105341*])

* Previously, if a cluster failed to install on Google Cloud Platform because the service account had insufficient permissions, the resulting error message did not mention this as the cause of the failure. This update improves the error message, which now instructs users to check the permissions that are assigned to the service account. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2103236[*BZ#2103236*])

* Previously, when an installation on Google Cloud provider (GCP) failed because an invalid GCP region was specified, the resulting error message did not mention this as the cause of the failure. This update improves the error message, which now states the region is not valid. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102324[*BZ#2102324*])

* Previously, cluster installations using Hive could fail if Hive used an older version of the install-config.yaml file. This update allows the installer to accept older versions of the `install-config.yaml` file provided by Hive. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2098299[*BZ#2098299*])

* Previously, the installation program would incorrectly allow the `apiVIP` and `ingressVIP` parameters to use the same IPv6 address if they represented the address differently, such as listing the address in an abbreviated format. In this update, the installer correctly validates these two parameters regardless of their formatting, requiring separate IP addresses for each parameter. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2103144[*BZ#2103144*])

* Previously, uninstalling a cluster using the installation program failed to delete all resources in clusters installed on GCP if the cluster name was more than 22 characters long. In this update, uninstalling a cluster using the installation program correctly locates and deletes all GCP cluster resources in cases of long cluster names. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2076646[*BZ#2076646*])

* Previously, when installing a cluster on {rh-openstack-first} with multiple networks defined in the `machineNetwork` parameter, the installation program only created security group rules for the first network. With this update, the installation program creates security group rules for all networks defined in the `machineNetwork` so that users no longer need to manually edit security group rules after installation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2095323[*BZ#2095323*])

* Previously, users could manually set the API and Ingress virtual IP addresses to values that conflicted with the allocation pool of the DHCP server when installing a cluster on OpenStack. This could cause the DHCP server to assign one of the VIP addresses to a new machine, which would fail to start. In this update, the installation program validates the user-provided VIP addresses to ensure that they do not conflict with any DHCP pools. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1944365[*BZ1944365*])

* Previously, when installing a cluster on vSphere using a datacenter that is embedded inside a folder, the installation program could not locate the datacenter object, causing the installation to fail. In this update, the installation program can traverse the directory that contains the datacenter object, allowing the installation to succeed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2097691[*BZ2097691*])

* Previously, when installing a cluster on Azure using arm64 architecture with installer-provisioned infrastructure, the image definition resource for hyperVGeneration V1 incorrectly had an architecture value of `x64`. With this update, the image definition resource for hyperVGeneration V1 has the correct architecture value of `Arm64`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3639[*OCPBUGS-3639*])

* Previously, when installing a cluster on VMware vSphere, the installation could fail if the user specified a user-defined folder in the `failureDomain` section of the `install-config.yaml` file. With this update, the installation program correctly validates user-defined folders in the `failureDomain` section of the `install-config.yaml` file. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3343[*OCPBUGS-3343*])

* Previously, when destroying a partially deployed cluster after an installation failed on VMware vSphere, some virtual machine folders were not destroyed. This error could occur in clusters configured with multiple vSphere datacenters or multiple vSphere clusters. With this update, all installer-provisioned infrastructure is correctly deleted when destroying a partially deployed cluster after an installation failure. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1489[*OCPBUGS-1489*])

* Previously, when installing a cluster on VMware vSphere, the installation failed if the user specified the `platform.vsphere.vcenters` parameter but did not specify the `platform.vsphere.failureDomains.topology.networks` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` file. With this update, the installation program alerts the user that the `platform.vsphere.failureDomains.topology.networks` field is required when specifying `platform.vsphere.vcenters`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1698[*OCPBUGS-1698*])

* Previously, when installing a cluster on VMware vSphere, the installation failed if the user defined the `platform.vsphere.vcenters` and `platform.vsphere.failureDomains` parameters but did not define `platform.vsphere.defaultMachinePlatform.zones`, or `compute.platform.vsphere.zones` and `controlPlane.platform.vsphere.zones`. With this update, the installation program validates that the user has defined the `zones` parameter in multi-region or multi-zone deployments prior to installation.

[id="ocp-4-12-machine-config-operator-bug-fixes"]
==== Machine Config Operator

* Previously, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) `ControllerConfig` resource, which contains important certificates, was only synced if the Operator's daemon sync succeeded. By design, unready nodes during a daemon sync prevent that daemon sync from succeeding, so unready nodes were indirectly preventing the `ControllerConfig` resource, and therefore those certificates, from syncing. This resulted in eventual cluster degradation when there were unready nodes due to inability to rotate the certificates contained in the `ControllerConfig` resource. With this release, the sync of the `ControllerConfig` resource is no longer dependent on the daemon sync succeeding, so the `ControllerConfig` resource now continues to sync if the daemon sync fails. This means that unready nodes no longer prevent the `ControllerConfig` resource from syncing, so certificates continue to be updated even when there are unready nodes.

* Previously, the *Operator details* page attempted to display multiple error messages, but the error message component can only display a single error message at a time. As a result, relevant error messages were not displayed. With this update, the *Operator details* page displays only the first error message so the user sees a relevant error. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3927[*OCPBUGS-3927*])

* Previously, the product name for Azure Red Hat OpenShift was incorrect in Customer Case Management (CCM). As a result, the console had to use the same incorrect product name to correctly populate the fields in CCM. Once the product name in CCM was updated, the console needed to be updated as well. With this update, the same, correct product name as CCM is correctly populated with the correct Azure product name when following the link from the console. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-869[*OCPBUGS-869*])

* Previously, when a plug-in page resulted in an error, the error did not reset when navigating away from the error page, and the error persisted after navigating to a page that was not the cause of the error. With this update, the error state is reset to its default when a user navigates to a new page, and the error no longer persists after navigating to a new page. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2117738[*BZ#2117738*], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-523[*OCPBUGS-523*])

* Previously, the *_View it here_* link in the *Operator details* pane for installed Operators was incorrectly built when *_All Namespaces_* was selected. As a result, the link attempted to navigate to the *Operator details* page for a cluster service version (CSV) in *All Projects*, which is an invalid route. With this update, the *_View it here_* link to use the namespace where the CSV is installed now builds correctly and the link works as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-184[*OCPBUGS-184*])

* Previously, line numbers with more than five digits resulted in a cosmetic issue where the line number overlaid the vertical divider between the line number and the line contents making it harder to read. With this update, the amount of space available for line numbers was increased to account for longer line numbers, and the line number no longer overlays the vertical divider. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-183[*OCPBUGS-183*])

* Previously, in the administrator perspective of the web console, the link to *_Learn more about the OpenShift local update services_* on the *Default update server* pop-up window in the *Cluster Settings* page produced a 404 error. With this update, the link works as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2098234[*BZ#2098234*])

* Previously, the `MatchExpression` component did not account for array-type values. As a result,  only single values could be entered through forms using this component. With this update, the `MatchExpression` component accepts comma-separated values as an array. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2079690[*BZ#207690*])

* Previously, there were redundant checks for the model resulting in tab reloading which occasionally resulted in a flickering of the tab contents where they rerendered. With this update, the redundant model check was removed, and the model is only checked once. As a result, the tab contents do not flicker and no longer rerender. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2037329[*BZ#2037329*])

* Previously, when selecting the `edit` label from the action list on the OpenShift Dedicated node page, no response was elicited and a web hook error was returned. This issue has been fixed so that the error message is only returned when editing fails. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102098[*BZ#2102098*])

* Previously, if issues were pending, clicking on the *Insights* link would crash the page. As a workaround, you can wait for the variable to become `initialized` before clicking the *Insights* link. As a result, the Insights page will open as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2052662[*BZ#2052662*])

* Previously, when the `MachineConfigPool` resource was paused, the option to unpause said *Resume rollouts*. The wording has been updated so that it now says *Resume updates*. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2094240[*BZ#2094240*])

* Previously, the wrong calculating method was used when counting master and worker nodes. With this update, the correct worker nodes are calculated when nodes have both the `master` and `worker` role. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1951901[*BZ#1951901*])

* Previously, conflicting `react-router` routes for `ImageManifestVuln` resulted in attempts to render a details page for `ImageManifestVuln` with a `~new` name. Now, the container security plugin has been updated to remove conflicting routes and to ensure dynamic lists and details page extensions are used on the Operator details page. As a result, the console renders the correct create, list, and details pages for `ImageManifestVuln`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2080260[*BZ#2080260*])

[id="ocp-4-12-monitoring-bug-fixes"]
==== Monitoring

* Before this update, cluster administrators could not distinguish between a pod being not ready because of a scheduling issue and a pod being not ready because it could not be started by the kubelet. In both cases, the `KubePodNotReady` alert would fire. With this update, the `KubePodNotScheduled` alert now fires when a pod is not ready because of a scheduling issue, and the `KubePodNotReady` alert fires when a pod is not ready because it could not be started by the kubelet. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-4431[*OCPBUGS-4431*])

* Before this update, `node_exporter` would report metrics about virtual network interfaces such as `tun` interfaces, `br` interfaces, and `ovn-k8s-mp` interfaces. With this update, metrics for these virtual interfaces are no longer collected, which decreases monitoring resource consumption. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1321[*OCPBUGS-1321*])

* Before this update, Alertmanager pod startup might time out because of slow DNS resolution, and the Alertmanager pods would not start. With this release, the timeout value has been increased to seven minutes, which prevents pod startup from timing out. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2083226[*BZ#2083226*])

* Before this update, if Prometheus Operator failed to run or schedule Prometheus pods, the system provided no underlying reason for the failure. With this update, if Prometheus pods are not run or scheduled, the Cluster Monitoring Operator updates the `clusterOperator` monitoring status with a reason for the failure, which can be used to troubleshoot the underlying issue. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2043518[*BZ#2043518*])

* Before this update, if you created an alert silence from the *Developer* perspective in the {product-title} web console, external labels were included that did not match the alert. Therefore, the alert would not be silenced. With this update, external labels are now excluded when you create a silence in the *Developer* perspective so that newly created silences function as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2084504[*BZ#2084504*])

* Previously, if you enabled an instance of Alertmanager dedicated to user-defined projects, a misconfiguration could occur in certain circumstances, and you would not be informed that the user-defined project Alertmanager config map settings did not load for either the main instance of Alertmanager or the instance dedicated to user-defined projects. With this release, if this misconfiguration occurs, the Cluster Monitoring Operator now displays a message that informs you of the issue and provides resolution steps. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2099939[*BZ#2099939*])

* Before this update, if the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) failed to update Prometheus, the CMO did not verify whether a previous deployment was running and would report that cluster monitoring was unavailable even if one of the Prometheus pods was still running. With this update, the CMO now checks for running Prometheus pods in this situation and reports that cluster monitoring is unavailable only if no Prometheus pods are running. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2039411[*BZ#2039411*])

* Before this update, if you configured OpsGenie as an alert receiver, a warning would appear in the log that `api_key` and `api_key_file` are mutually exclusive and that `api_key` takes precedence. This warning appeared even if you had not defined `api_key_file`. With this update, this warning only appears in the log if you have defined both `api_key` and `api_key_file`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2093892[*BZ#2093892*])

* Before this update the Telemeter Client (TC) only loaded new pull secrets when it was manually restarted. Therefore, if a pull secret had been changed or updated and the TC had not been restarted, the TC would fail to authenticate with the server. This update addresses the issue so that when the secret is rotated, the deployment is automatically restarted and uses the updated token to authenticate.

[id="ocp-4-12-networking-bug-fixes"]
==== Networking

* Previously, routers that were in the terminating state delayed the `oc cp` command which would delay the `oc adm must-gather` command until the pod was terminated. With this update, a timeout for each issued `oc cp` command is set to prevent delaying the `must-gather` command from running. As a result, terminating pods no longer delay `must-gather` commands. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2103283[*BZ#2103283*])

* Previously, an Ingress Controller could not be configured with both the `Private` endpoint publishing strategy type and PROXY protocol. With this update, users can now configure an Ingress Controller with both the `Private` endpoint publishing strategy type and PROXY protocol. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2104481[*BZ#2104481*])

* Previously, the `routeSelector` parameter cleared the route status of the Ingress Controller prior to the router deployment. Because of this, the route status repopulated incorrectly. To avoid using stale data, route status detection has been updated to no longer rely on the Kubernetes object cache. Additionally, this update includes a fix to check the generation ID on route deployment in order to determine the route status. As a result, the route status is consistently cleared with a `routeSelector` update. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2101878[*BZ#2101878*])

* Previously, a cluster that was upgraded from a version of {product-title} earlier than 4.8 could have orphaned `Route` objects. This was caused by earlier versions of {product-title} translating `Ingress` objects into `Route` objects irrespective of a given `Ingress` object's indicated `IngressClass`. With this update, an alert is sent to the cluster administrator about any orphaned Route objects still present in the cluster after Ingress-to-Route translation. This update also adds another alert that notifies the cluster administrator about any Ingress objects that do not specify an `IngressClass`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1962502[*BZ#1962502*])

* Previously, if a `configmap` that the router deployment depends on is not created, then the router deployment does not progress. With this update, the cluster Operator reports `ingress progressing=true` if the default ingress controller deployment is progressing. This results in users debugging issues with the ingress controller by using the command `oc get co`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2066560[*BZ#2066560*])

* With this update, CoreDNS has been updated to version 1.10.0, which is based on Kubernetes 1.25. This keeps both the CoreDNS version and {product-title} {product-version}, which is also based on Kubernetes 1.25, in alignment with one another. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1731[*OCPBUGS-1731*])

* With this update, the {product-title} router now uses `k8s.io/client-go` version 1.25.2, which supports Kubernetes 1.25. This keeps both the `openshift-router` and {product-title} {product-version}, which is also based on Kubernetes 1.25, in alignment with one another. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1730[*OCPBUGS-1730*])

* With this update, the Ingress Operator now uses `k8s.io/client-go` version 1.25.2, which supports Kubernetes 1.25. This keeps both the Ingress Operator and {product-title} {product-version}, which is also based on Kubernetes 1.25, in alignment with one another. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1554[*OCPBUGS-1554*])

* Previously, the DNS Operator did not reconcile the `openshift-dns` namespace. Because {product-title} {product-version} requires the `openshift-dns` namespace to have pod-security labels, this caused the namespace to be missing those labels upon cluster update. Without the pod-security labels, the pods failed to start. With this update, the DNS Operator now reconciles the `openshift-dns` namespace, and the pod-security labels are now present. As a result, pods start up as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1549[*OCPBUGS-1549*])

* Previously, the `ingresscontroller.spec.tuniningOptions.reloadInterval` did not support decimal numerals as valid parameter values because the Ingress Operator internally converts the specified value into milliseconds, which was not a supported time unit. This prevented an Ingress Controller from being deleted. With this update, `ingresscontroller.spec.tuningOptions.reloadInterval` now supports decimal numerals and users can delete Ingress Controllers with `reloadInterval` parameter values which were previously unsupported. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-236[*OCPBUGS-236*])

* Previously, the Cluster DNS Operator used GO kubernetes libraries that were based on Kubernetes 1.24 while {product-title} 4.12 is based on Kubernetes 1.25. With this update, GO Kubernetes API is v1.25.2, which aligns the Cluster DNS Operator with {product-title} 4.12 that uses Kubernetes 1.25 APIs. (link: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1558[*OCPBUGS-1558*])

* Previously, setting the `disableNetworkDiagnostics` configuration to `true` did not persist when the `network-operator` pod was re-created. With this update, the `disableNetworkDiagnostics` configuration property of network`operator.openshift.io/cluster` no longer resets to its default value after network operator restart. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-392[*OCPBUGS-392*])
* Previously, `ovn-kubernetes` did not configure the correct MAC address of bonded interfaces in `br-ex` bridge. As a result, a node that uses bonding for the primary Kubernetes interface fails to join the cluster. With this update, `ovn-kubernetes` configures the correct MAC address of bonded interfaces in `br-ex` bridge, and nodes that use bonding for the primary Kubernetes interface successfully join the cluster.

* Previously, when the Ingress Operator was configured to enable the use of mTLS, the Operator would not check if CRLs needed updating until some other event caused it to reconcile. As a result, CRLs used for mTLS could become out of date. With this update, the Ingress Operator now automatically reconciles when any CRL expires, and CRLs will be updated at the time specified by their `nextUpdate` field.

==== Node

* Previously, a symlinks error message was printed out as raw data instead of formatted as an error, making it difficult to understand. This fix formats the error message properly, so that it is easily understood. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1977660[*BZ#1977660*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-12-openshift-cli-bug-fixes"]
==== OpenShift CLI (oc)

* The {product-title} {product-version} release fixes an issue with entering a debug session on a target node when the target namespace lacks the appropriate security level. This caused the `oc` CLI to prompt you with a pod security error message. If the existing namespace does not contain the appropriate security levels, {product-title} now creates a temporary namespace when you enter `oc` debug mode on a target node. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-852[OCPBUGS-852])

* Previously, on macOS arm64 architecture, the `oc` binary needed to be signed manually. As a result, the `oc` binary did not work as expected. This update implements a self-signing binary for `oc` mimicking. As a result, the `oc` binary on macOS arm64 architectures works properly. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2059125[*BZ#2059125*])

* Previously, `must-gather` was trying to collect resources that were not present on the server. Consequently, `must-gather` would print error messages. Now, before collecting resources, `must-gather` checks whether the resource exists. As a result, `must-gather` no longer prints an error when it fails to collect non-existing resources on the server. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2095708[*BZ#2095708*])

* The {product-title} {product-version} release updates the `oc-mirror` library, so that the library supports multi-arch platform images. This means that you can choose from a wider selection of architectures, such as `arm64`, when mirroring a platform release payload. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-617[*OCPBUGS-617*])

[id="ocp-4-12-olm-bug-fixes"]
==== Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

* Before the {product-title} {product-version} release, the `package-server-manager` controller would not revert any changes made to a `package-server` cluster service version (CSV), because of an issue with the `on-cluster` function. These persistent changes might impact how an Operator starts in a cluster. For {product-title} {product-version}, the `package-server-manager` controller always rebuilds a `package-server` CSV to its original state, so that no modifications to the CSV persist after a cluster upgrade operation. The `on-cluster` function no longer controls the state of a `package-server` CSV. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-867[*OCPBUGS-867*])

* Previously, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) would attempt to update namespaces to apply a label, even if the label was present on the namespace. Consequently, the update requests increased the workload in API and etcd services. With this update, OLM compares existing labels against the expected labels on a namespace before issuing an update. As a result, OLM no longer attempts to make unnecessary update requests on namespaces. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2105045[*BZ#2105045*])

* Previously, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) would prevent minor cluster upgrades that should not be blocked based on a miscalculation of the `ClusterVersion` custom resources's `spec.DesiredVersion` field. With this update, OLM no longer prevents cluster upgrades when the upgrade should be supported. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2097557[*BZ#2097557*])

* Previously, the reconciler would update a resource's annotation without making a copy of the resource. This caused an error that would terminate the reconciler process. With this update, the reconciler no longer stops due the error. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2105045[*BZ#2105045*])

* The `package-server-manifest` (PSM) is a controller that ensures that the correct `package-server` Cluster Service Version (CSV) is installed on a cluster. Previously, changes to the `package-server` CSV were not being reverted because of a logical error in the reconcile function in which an on-cluster object could influence the expected object. Users could modify the `package-server` CSV and the changes would not be reverted. Additionally, cluster upgrades would not update the YAML for the `package-server` CSV. With this update, the expected version of the CSV is now always built from scratch, which removes the ability for an on-cluster object to influence the expected values. As a result, the PSM now reverts any attempts to modify the `package-server` CSV, and cluster upgrades now deploy the expected `package-server` CSV.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-12-openshift-operator-sdk-bug-fixes"]
==== Operator SDK

* With this update, you can now set the security context for the registry pod by including the `securityContext` configuration field in the pod specification. This will apply the security context for all containers in the pod. The `securityContext` field also defines the pod's privileges. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2091864[*BZ#2091864*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-12-file-integrity-operator-bug-fixes"]
==== File Integrity Operator

* Previously, the File Integrity Operator deployed templates using the `openshift-file-integrity` namespace in the permissions for the Operator. When the Operator attempted to create objects in the namespace, it would fail due to permission issues. With this release, the deployment resources used by OLM are updated to use the correct namespace, fixing the permission issues so that users can install and use the operator in non-default namespaces. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2104897[*BZ#2104897*])

* Previously, underlying dependencies of the File Integrity Operator changed how alerts and notifications were handled, and the Operator didn't send metrics as a result. With this release the Operator ensures that the metrics endpoint is correct and reachable on startup. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2115821[*BZ#2115821*])

* Previously, alerts issued by the File Integrity Operator did not set a namespace. This made it difficult to understand where the alert was coming from, or what component was responsible for issuing it. With this release, the Operator includes the namespace it was installed into in the alert, making it easier to narrow down what component needs attention. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2101393[*BZ#2101393*])

* Previously, the File Integrity Operator did not properly handle modifying alerts during an upgrade. As a result, alerts did not include the namespace in which the Operator was installed. With this release, the Operator includes the namespace it was installed into in the alert, making it easier to narrow down what component needs attention. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2112394[*BZ#2112394*])

* Previously, service account ownership for the File Integrity Operator regressed due to underlying OLM updates, and updates from 0.1.24 to 0.1.29 were broken. With this update, the Operator should default to upgrading to 0.1.30. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2109153[*BZ#2109153*]

* Previously, the File Integrity Operator daemon used the `ClusterRoles` parameter instead of the `Roles` parameter for a recent permission change. As a result, OLM could not update the Operator. With this release, the Operator daemon reverts to using the `Roles` parameter and updates from older versions to version 0.1.29 are successful. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2108475[*BZ#2108475*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-12-compliance-operator-bug-fixes"]
==== Compliance Operator

* Previously, the Compliance Operator used an old version of the Operator SDK, which is a dependency for building Operators. This caused alerts about deprecated Kubernetes functionality used by the Operator SDK. With this release, the Compliance Operator is updated to version 0.1.55, which includes an updated version of the Operator SDK. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2098581[*BZ#2098581*])

* Previously, applying automatic remediation for the `rhcos4-high-master-sysctl-kernel-yama-ptrace-scope` and `rhcos4-sysctl-kernel-core-pattern` rules resulted in subsequent failures of those rules in scan results, even though they were remediated. The issue is fixed in this release. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2094382[*BZ#2094382*])

* Previously, the Compliance Operator hardcoded notifications to the default namespace. As a result, notifications from the Operator would not appear if the Operator was installed in a different namespace. This issue is fixed in this release. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2060726[*BZ#2060726*])

* Previously, the Compliance Operator failed to fetch API resources when parsing machine configurations without Ignition specifications. This caused the `api-check-pods` check to crash loop. With this release, the Compliance Operator is updated to gracefully handle machine configuration pools without Ignition specifications. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2117268[*BZ#2117268*])

* Previously, the Compliance Operator held machine configurations in a stuck state because it could not determine the relationship between machine configurations and kubelet configurations. This was due to incorrect assumptions about machine configuration names. With this release, the Compliance Operator is able to determine if a kubelet configuration is a subset of a machine configuration. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2102511[*BZ#2102511*])

[id="ocp-4-12-openshift-api-server-bug-fixes"]
==== OpenShift API server

* Previously, adding a member could remove previous members from a group. As a result, the user lost group privileges. With this release, the dependencies were bumped and users no longer lose group privledges. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-533[*OCPBUGS-533*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-12-rhcos-bug-fixes"]
==== {op-system-first}

* Previously, updating to Podman 4.0 prevented users from using custom images with toolbox containers on {op-system}. This fix updates the toolbox library code to account for the new Podman behavior, so users can now use custom images with toolbox on {op-system} as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2048789[*BZ#2048789*])

* Previously, the `podman exec` command did not work well with nested containers. Users encountered this issue when accessing a node using the `oc debug` command and then running a container with the `toolbox` command. Because of this, users were unable to reuse toolboxes on {op-system}. This fix updates the toolbox library code to account for this behavior, so users can now reuse toolboxes on {op-system}. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1915537[*BZ#1915537*])

* With this update, running the `toolbox` command now checks for updates to the default image before launching the container. This improves security and provides users with the latest bug fixes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049591[*BZ#2049591*])

* Previously, updating to Podman 4.0 prevented users from running the `toolbox` command on {op-system}. This fix updates the toolbox library code to account for the new Podman behavior, so users can now run `toolbox` on {op-system} as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2093040[*BZ#2093040*])

* Previously, custom SELinux policy modules were not properly supported by `rpm-ostree`, so they were not updated along with the rest of the system upon update. This would surface as failures in unrelated components. Pending SELinux userspace improvements landing in a future {product-title} release, this update provides a workaround to {op-system} that will rebuild and reload the SELinux policy during boot as needed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-595[*OCPBUGS-595*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-12-low-latency-tuning-bug-fixes"]
==== Low latency tuning

* The tuned profile has been modified to assign the same priority as `ksoftirqd` and `rcuc` to the newly introduced per-CPU kthreads (`ktimers`) added in a recent Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) kernel patch. For more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-3475[*OCPBUGS-3475*], link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2117780[*BZ#2117780*] and link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2122220[*BZ#2122220*].

* Previously, restarts of the `tuned` service caused improper reset of the `irqbalance` configuration, leading to IRQ operation being served again on the isolated CPUs, therefore violating the isolation guarantees. With this fix, the `irqbalance` service configuration is properly preserved across `tuned` service restarts (explicit or caused by bugs), therefore preserving the CPU isolation guarantees with respect to IRQ serving. For more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-585[*OCPBUGS-585*].

* Previously, when the tuned daemon was restarted out of order as part of the cluster Node Tuning Operator, the CPU affinity of interrupt handlers was reset and the tuning was compromised. With this fix, the `irqbalance` plug-in in tuned is disabled, and {product-title} now relies on the logic and interaction between `CRI-O` and `irqbalance`. For more information, see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2105123[*BZ#2105123*].

* Previously, a low latency hook script executing for every new `veth` device took too long when the node was under load. The resultant accumulated delays during pod start events caused the rollout time for `kube-apiserver` to be slow and sometimes exceed the 5-minute rollout timeout. With this fix, the container start time should be shorter and within the 5-minute threshold. For more information, see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2109965[*BZ#2109965*].

* Previously, the `oslat` control thread was collocated with one of the test threads, which caused latency spikes in the measurements. With this fix, the `oslat` runner now reserves one CPU for the control thread, meaning the test uses one less CPU for running the busy threads. For more information, see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2051443[*BZ#2051443*].


* Latency measurement tools, also known as `oslat`, `cyclictest`, and `hwlatdetect`, now run on completely isolated CPUs without the helper process running in the background that might cause latency spikes, thus providing more accurate latency measurements. For more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2618[*OCPBUGS-2618*].

==== Storage

* Previously, checks for generic ephemeral volumes failed. With this update, checks for expandable volumes now include generic ephemeral volumes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2082773[*BZ#2082773*]

* Previously, if more than one secret was present for vSphere, the vSphere CSI Operator randomly picked a secret and sometimes caused the Operator to restart. With this update, a warning appears when there is more than one secret on the vCenter CSI Operator. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2108473[*BZ#2108473*])

* Previously, {product-title} detached a volume when a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver was not able to unmount the volume from a node. Detaching a volume without unmount is not allowed by CSI specifications and drivers could enter an `undocumented` state. With this update, CSI drivers are detached before unmounting only on unhealthy nodes preventing the `undocumented` state. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049306[*BZ#2049306*])

* Previously, there were missing annotations on the Manila CSI Driver Operator's VolumeSnapshotClass. Consequently, the Manila CSI snapshotter could not locate secrets, and could not create snapshots with the default VolumeSnapshotClass. This update fixes the issue so that secret names and namespaces are included in the default VolumeSnapshotClass. As a result, users can now create snapshots in the Manila CSI Driver Operator using the default VolumeSnapshotClass. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2057637[*BZ#2057637*])

* Users can now opt into using the experimental VHD feature on Azure File. To opt in, users must specify the `fstype` parameter in a storage class and enable it with `--enable-vhd=true`. If `fstype` is used and the feature is not set to `true`, the volumes will fail to provision.
+
To opt out of using the VHD feature, remove the `fstype` parameter from your storage class. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2080449[*BZ#2080449*])

* Previously, checks for generic ephemeral volumes failed. With this update, checks for expandable volumes now include generic ephemeral volumes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2082773[*BZ#2082773*])

* Previously, if more than one secret was present for vSphere, the vSphere CSI Operator randomly picked a secret and sometimes caused the Operator to restart.

[id="ocp-4-12-windows-containers-bug-fixes"]
==== Windows containers

* Previously, restarting the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) in a cluster with running Windows nodes caused the Windows exporter endpoint to be removed. Because of this, each Windows node could not report any metrics data. With this update, the endpoint is retained when the WMCO is started. As a result, metrics data is reported properly after restarting WMCO. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2107261[*BZ#2107261*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-12-web-console-developer-perspective-bug-fixes"]
==== Web console (Developer perspective)

* Previously, the users could not deselect a Git secret in add and edit forms. As a result, the resources had to be recreated. This fix resolves the issue by adding the option to choose `No Secret` in the select secret option list. As a result, the users can easily select, deselect, or detach any attached secrets. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2089221[*BZ#2089221*])

* In {product-title} 4.9, when it is minimal or no data in the *Developer Perspective*, most of the monitoring charts or graphs (CPU consumption, memory usage, and bandwidth) show a range of -1 to 1. However, none of these values can ever go below zero. This will be resolved in a future release. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1904106[*BZ#1904106*])

* Before this update, users could not silence alerts in the *Developer* perspective in the {product-title} web console when a user-defined Alertmanager service was deployed because the web console would forward the request to the platform Alertmanager service in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace. With this update, when you view the *Developer* perspective in the web console and try to silence an alert, the request is forwarded to the correct Alertmanager service.

== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.8 and beyond! This needs some SME/QE review before being updated for 4.11. Need to check if KI should be removed or should stay.
* In {product-title} 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.
+
If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.1 to {product-version}, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. Unless there is a specific need for unauthenticated access, you should revoke it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP `403` errors if you revoke unauthenticated access.
====
+
Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:
+
[source,bash]
----
## Snippet to remove unauthenticated group from all the cluster role bindings
$ for clusterrolebinding in cluster-status-binding discovery system:basic-user system:discovery system:openshift:discovery ;
do
### Find the index of unauthenticated group in list of subjects
index=$(oc get clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} -o json | jq 'select(.subjects!=null) | .subjects | map(.name=="system:unauthenticated") | index(true)');
### Remove the element at index from subjects array
oc patch clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} --type=json --patch "[{'op': 'remove','path': '/subjects/$index'}]";
done
----
+
This script removes unauthenticated subjects from the following cluster role bindings:
+
--
** `cluster-status-binding`
** `discovery`
** `system:basic-user`
** `system:discovery`
** `system:openshift:discovery`

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.9 and beyond!
* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])

* Due to the inclusion of old images in some image indexes, running `oc adm catalog mirror` and `oc image mirror` might result in the following error: `error: unable to retrieve source image`. As a temporary workaround, you can use the `--skip-missing` option to bypass the error and continue downloading the image index. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6975305[Service Mesh Operator mirroring failed].

* There is a known issue with Nutanix installation where the installation fails if you use 4096-bit certificates with Prism Central 2022.x. Instead, use 2048-bit certificates. (link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6976743[*KCS*])

* Deleting the bidirectional forwarding detection (BFD) profile and removing the `bfdProfile` added to the border gateway protocol (BGP) peer resource does not disable the BFD. Instead, the BGP peer starts using the default BFD profile. To disable BFD from a BGP peer resource, delete the BGP peer configuration and recreate it without a BFD profile. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2050824[*BZ#2050824*])

* Due to an unresolved metadata API issue, you cannot install clusters that use bare-metal workers on {rh-openstack} 16.1. Clusters on {rh-openstack} 16.2 are not impacted by this issue. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2033953[*BZ#2033953*])

* The `loadBalancerSourceRanges` attribute is not supported, and is thus ignored, in load-balancer type services in clusters that run on {rh-openstack} and use the OVN Octavia provider. There is no workaround for this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-2789[*OCPBUGS-2789*]) 

* Platform Operator and RukPak known issues:

** Deleting a platform Operator results in a cascading deletion of the underlying resources. This cascading deletion logic can only delete resources that are defined in the Operator Lifecycle Manager-based (OLM) Operator's bundle format. In the case that a platform Operator creates resources that are defined outside of that bundle format, then the platform Operator is responsible for handling this cleanup interaction. This behavior can be observed when installing the cert-manager Operator as a platform Operator, and then removing it. The expected behavior is that a namespace is left behind that the cert-manager Operator created.

** The platform Operators manager does not have any logic that compares the current and desired state of the cluster-scoped `BundleDeployment` resource it is managing. This leaves the possibility for a user who has sufficient role-based access control (RBAC) to manually modify that underlying `BundleDeployment` resource and can lead to situations where users can escalate their permissions to the `cluster-admin` role. By default, you should limit access to this resource to a small number of users that explicitly require access. The only supported client for the `BundleDeployment` resource during this Technology Preview release is the platform Operators manager component.

** OLM's Marketplace component is an optional cluster capability that can be disabled. This has implications during the Technology Preview release because platform Operators are currently only sourced from the `redhat-operators` catalog source that is managed by the Marketplace component. As a workaround, a cluster administrator can create this catalog source manually.

** The RukPak provisioner implementations do not have the ability to inspect the health or state of the resources that they are managing. This has implications for surfacing the generated `BundleDeployment` resource state to the `PlatformOperator` resource that owns it. If a `registry+v1` bundle contains manifests that can be successfully applied to the cluster, but will fail at runtime, such as a `Deployment` object referencing a non-existent image, the result is a successful status being reflected in individual `PlatformOperator` and `BundleDeployment` resources.

** Cluster administrators configuring `PlatformOperator` resources before cluster creation cannot easily determine the desired package name without leveraging an existing cluster or relying on documented examples. There is currently no validation logic that ensures an individually configured `PlatformOperator` resource will be able to successfully roll out to the cluster.

* When using the Technology Preview OCI feature with the oc-mirror CLI plug-in, the mirrored catalog embeds all of the Operator bundles, instead of filtering only on those specified in the image set configuration file. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5085[*OCPBUGS-5085*])

* There is currently a known issue when you run the Agent-based {product-title} Installer to generate an ISO image from a directory where the previous release was used for ISO image generation. An error message is displayed with the release version not matching. As a workaround, create and use a new directory. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5159[*OCPBUGS#5159*])

* The defined capabilities in the `install-config.yaml` file are not applied in the Agent-based {product-title} installation. Currently, there is no workaround. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5129[*OCPBUGS#5129*])

* Pods in the `openshift-marketplace` namespace cause `PodSecurityViolation` alerts in a default {product-title} cluster. This is because the newly created project's `pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn` annotation and audit are restricted, and the CatalogSource's `spec.grpcPodConfig.securityContextConfig` field is not restricted by default, so you will get the related pod security admission (PSA) warnings, like below:
+
[source,terminal]
----
W0105 03:04:13.729506 1 warnings.go:70 would violate PodSecurity "restricted:v1.24": allowPrivilegeEscalation != false (container "registry-server" must set securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation=false), unrestricted capabilities (container "registry-server" must set securityContext.capabilities.drop=["ALL"]), runAsNonRoot != true (pod or container "registry-server" must set securityContext.runAsNonRoot=true), seccompProfile (pod or container "registry-server" must set securityContext.seccompProfile.type to "RuntimeDefault" or "Localhost")
----
+
The following `PodSecurityViolation` alert is also displayed in the `Status` window of the web console:
+
[source,terminal]
----
A workload (pod,deployment,daemonsset,...) was created in the cluster but it did not match the PodSecurity `restricted` profile defined by its namespace either via the cluster-wide configuration (which triggers on a `restricted` profile violations) or by the namespace local Pod Security labels. Refer to Kubernetes documentation on Pod Security Admission to learn more about these viloations.
----
+
As a workaround, remove those warnings by changing the project's `pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn` label and audit to `baseline` or change the CatalogSource's `spec.grpcPodConfig.securityContextConfig` field to `restricted`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-5423[*OCPBUGS-5423])
