=== Installation and upgrade

[id="ocp-4-12-aws-load-balancer-customization"]
==== Specify the load balancer type in AWS during installation
Beginning with {product-title} {product-version}, you can specify either Network Load Balancer (NLB) or Classic as a persistent load balancer type in AWS during installation. Afterwards, if an Ingress Controller is deleted, the load balancer type persists with the lbType configured during installation.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-network-customizations.adoc[Installing a cluster on AWS with network customizations].

[id="ocp-4-12-installation-and-upgrade-gcp-marketplace"]
==== Google Cloud Platform Marketplace offering
{product-title} is now available on the GCP Marketplace. Installing an {product-title} with a GCP Marketplace image lets you create self-managed cluster deployments that are billed on pay-per-use basis (hourly, per core) through GCP, while still being supported directly by Red Hat.

For more information about installing using installer-provisioned infrastructure, see xref:../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-customizations.adoc#installation-gcp-marketplace_installing-gcp-customizations[Using a GCP Marketplace image].

[id="ocp-4-12-admin-ack-upgrading"]
==== Required administrator acknowledgment when upgrading from {product-title} 4.11 to 4.12

{product-title} 4.12 uses Kubernetes 1.25, which removed xref:../release_notes/ocp-4-12-release-notes.adoc#ocp-4-12-removed-kube-1-25-apis[several deprecated APIs].

A cluster administrator must provide a manual acknowledgment before the cluster can be upgraded from {product-title} 4.11 to 4.12. This is to help prevent issues after upgrading to {product-title} 4.12, where APIs that have been removed are still in use by workloads, tools, or other components running on or interacting with the cluster. Administrators must evaluate their cluster for any APIs in use that will be removed and migrate the affected components to use the appropriate new API version. After this is done, the administrator can provide the administrator acknowledgment.

All {product-title} 4.11 clusters require this administrator acknowledgment before they can be upgraded to {product-title} 4.12.

For more information, see xref:../updating/updating-cluster-prepare.adoc#updating-cluster-prepare[Preparing to update to {product-title} 4.12].

[id="ocp-4-12-feature-set"]
==== Enabling a feature set when installing a cluster

|===

[id="ocp-4-12-nw-aws-load-balancer-operator"]
==== AWS Load Balancer Operator

In {product-title} 4.12, the AWS Load Balancer controller now implements the Kubernetes Ingress specification for multiple matches. If multiple paths within an Ingress match a request, the longest matching path takes the precedence. If two paths still match, paths with an exact path type take precedence over a prefix path type.

The AWS Load Balancer Operator sets the `EnableIPTargetType` feature gate to `false`. The AWS Load Balancer controller disables the support for services and ingress resources for `target-type` `ip`.

The upstream version of `aws-load-balancer-controller` for an {product-title} 4.12 is v2.4.4.

[id="ocp-4-12-nw-ingress-autoscaling"]
==== Ingress Controller Autoscaling (Technology Preview)

You can now use the {product-title} Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator to dynamically scale the default Ingress Controller based on metrics in your deployed cluster, such as the number of worker nodes available. The Custom Metrics Autoscaler is available as a Techology Preview feature.

For more information, see xref:../networking/ingress-operator.adoc#nw-autoscaling-ingress-controller_configuring-ingress[Autoscaling an Ingress Controller].

[id="ocp-4-12-nw-ingress-haproxy-maxconn-default"]
==== HAProxy maxConnections default is now 50,000

In {product-title} 4.12, the default value for the `maxConnections` setting is now 50000. Previously starting with {product-title} 4.11, the default value for the `maxConnections` setting was 20000.

For more information, see xref:../networking/ingress-operator.adoc#nw-ingress-controller-configuration-parameters_configuring-ingress[Ingress Controller configuration parameters].

[id="ocp-4-12-nw-configure-dns-management"]
==== Configuration of an Ingress Controller for manual DNS management

You can now configure an Ingress Controller to stop automatic DNS management and start manual DNS management. Set the `dnsManagementPolicy` parameter to specify automatic or manual DNS management.

For more information, see xref:../networking/ingress-controller-dnsmgt.adoc#ingress-controller-dnsmgt[Configuring an Ingress Controller to manually manage DNS].

[id="ocp-4-12-networking-supported-hardware-for-sr-iov"]

For more information, see xref:../networking/configuring_ingress_cluster_traffic/configuring-ingress-cluster-traffic-aws.adoc[Configuring ingress cluster traffic on AWS].

[id="ocp-4-12-ipv6-gratuitous-ARPs-default-SR-IOV"]
==== IPv6 unsolicited neighbor advertisements and IPv4 gratuitous address resolution protocol now default on the SR-IOV CNI plug-in

Pods created with the Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) CNI plug-in, where the IP address management CNI plug-in has assigned IPs, now send IPv6 unsolicited neighbor advertisements and/or IPv4 gratuitous address resolution protocol by default onto the network. This enhancement notifies hosts of the new pod's MAC address for a particular IP to refresh ARP/NDP caches with the correct information.

For more information, see xref:../networking/hardware_networks/about-sriov.adoc#supported-devices_about-sriov[Supported devices].

[id="ocp-4-12-coredns-cache-tuning"]

[id="ocp-4-12-ovn-kubernetes-supports-configuration-internal-subnet"]
==== OVN-Kubernetes supports configuration of internal subnet

Previously, the subnet that OVN-Kubernetes uses internally was `100.64.0.0/16` for IPv4 and `fd98::/48` for IPv6 and could not be modified. To support instances when these subnets overlap with existing subnets in your infrastructure, you can now change these internal subnets to avoid any overlap.

For more information, see xref:../networking/cluster-network-operator.adoc#nw-operator-cr-cno-object_cluster-network-operator[Cluster Network Operator configuration object]

[id=ocp-4-12-egress-ip-support]
==== Egress IP support on {rh-openstack-first}

{rh-openstack}, paired with {product-title}, now supports automatic attachment and detachment of Egress IP addresses. The traffic from one or more pods in any number of namespaces has a consistent source IP address for services outside of the cluster. This support applies to OpenShift SDN and OVN-Kubernetes as default network providers.

[id="ocp-4-12-openshift-sdn-ovn-kubernetes-feature-migration-support"]
==== OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes feature migration support

If you plan to migrate from the OpenShift SDN network plug-in to the OVN-Kubernetes network plug-in, your configurations for the following capabilities are automatically converted to work with OVN-Kubernetes:

* Egress IP addresses
* Egress firewalls
* Multicast

For more information about how the migration to OVN-Kubernetes works, see xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/migrate-from-openshift-sdn.adoc#migrate-from-openshift-sdn[Migrating from the OpenShift SDN cluster network provider].

[id="ocp-4-12-egress-firewall-audit-logging"]

You can now use pod topology spread constraints to control how Prometheus, Thanos Ruler, and Alertmanager pods are spread across a network topology when {product-title} pods are deployed in multiple availability zones.

[id="ocp-4-12-monitoring-new-option-to-improve-data-consistency-for-prometheus-adapter"]
==== New option to improve data consistency for Prometheus Adapter
You can now configure an optional kubelet service monitor for Prometheus Adapter (PA) that improves data consistency across multiple autoscaling requests.
Enabling this service monitor eliminates the possibility that two queries sent at the same time to PA might yield different results because the underlying PromQL queries executed by PA might be on different Prometheus servers.

[id="ocp-4-12-monitoring-update-to-alertmanager-configuration-for-additional-secret-keys"]
==== Update to Alertmanager configuration for additional secret keys
With this release, if you configure an Alertmanager secret to hold additional keys and if the Alertmanager configuration references these keys as files (such as templates, TLS certificates, or tokens), your configuration settings must point to these keys by using an absolute path rather than a relative path.
These keys are available under the `/etc/alertmanager/config` directory.
In earlier releases of {product-title}, you could use relative paths in your configuration to point to these keys because the Alertmanager configuration file was located in the same directory as the keys.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are upgrading to {product-title} {product-version} and have specified relative paths for additional Alertmanager secret keys that are referenced as files, you must change these relative paths to absolute paths in your Alertmanager configuration.
Otherwise, alert receivers that use the files will fail to deliver notifications.

=== Scalability and performance

[id="ocp-4-12-rsp-workload-hints"]
==== Disabling realtime using workload hints removes Receive Packet Steering from the cluster
At the cluster level by default, a systemd service sets a Receive Packet Steering (RPS) mask for virtual network interfaces. The RPS mask routes interrupt requests from virtual network interfaces according to the list of reserved CPUs defined in the performance profile. At the container level, a `CRI-O` hook script also sets an RPS mask for all virtual network devices.

With this update, if you set `spec.workloadHints.realTime` in the performance profile to `False`, the system also disables both the systemd service and the `CRI-O` hook script which set the RPS mask. The system disables these RPS functions because RPS is typically relevant to use cases requiring low-latency, realtime workloads only.

To retain RPS functions even when you set `spec.workloadHints.realTime` to `False`, see the _RPS Settings_ section of the Red Hat Knowledgebase solution link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5532341[Performance addons operator advanced configuration].

For more information about configuring workload hints, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/cnf-low-latency-tuning.adoc#cnf-understanding-workload-hints_cnf-master[Understanding workload hints].

[id="ocp-4-12-tuned"]
==== Tuned profile

The `tuned` profile now defines the `fs.aio-max-nr` `sysctl` value by default, improving asynchronous I/O performance for default node profiles.

[id="tuning-of-power-states"]
==== Power-saving configurations

In {product-title} {product-version}, by enabling C-states and OS-controlled P-states, you can use different power-saving configurations for critical and non-critical workloads. You can apply the configurations through the new `perPodPowerManagement` workload hint, and the `cpu-c-states.crio.io` and `cpu-freq-governor.crio.io` CRI-O annotations. For more information about the feature, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/cnf-low-latency-tuning.adoc#node-tuning-operator-pod-power-saving-config_cnf-master[Power-saving configurations].

== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.8 and beyond! This needs some SME/QE review before being updated for 4.11. Need to check if KI should be removed or should stay.
* In {product-title} 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.
+
If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.1 to 4.8, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. Unless there is a specific need for unauthenticated access, you should revoke it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP `403` errors if you revoke unauthenticated access.
====
+
Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:
+
[source,bash]
----
## Snippet to remove unauthenticated group from all the cluster role bindings
$ for clusterrolebinding in cluster-status-binding discovery system:basic-user system:discovery system:openshift:discovery ;
do
### Find the index of unauthenticated group in list of subjects
index=$(oc get clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} -o json | jq 'select(.subjects!=null) | .subjects | map(.name=="system:unauthenticated") | index(true)');
### Remove the element at index from subjects array
oc patch clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} --type=json --patch "[{'op': 'remove','path': '/subjects/$index'}]";
done
----
+
This script removes unauthenticated subjects from the following cluster role bindings:
+
--
** `cluster-status-binding`
** `discovery`
** `system:basic-user`
** `system:discovery`
** `system:openshift:discovery`

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.9 and beyond!
* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])

* Due to the inclusion of old images in some image indexes, running `oc adm catalog mirror` and `oc image mirror` might result in the following error: `error: unable to retrieve source image`. As a temporary workaround, you can use the `--skip-missing` option to bypass the error and continue downloading the image index. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6975305[Service Mesh Operator mirroring failed].

* There is a known issue with Nutanix installation where the installation fails if you use 4096-bit certificates with Prism Central 2022.x. Instead, use 2048-bit certificates. (link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6976743[*KCS*])

* Deleting the bidirectional forwarding detection (BFD) profile and removing the `bfdProfile` added to the border gateway protocol (BGP) peer resource does not disable the BFD. Instead, the BGP peer starts using the default BFD profile. To disable BFD from a BGP peer resource, delete the BGP peer configuration and recreate it without a BFD profile. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2050824[*BZ#2050824*])

* Due to an unresolved metadata API issue, you cannot install clusters that use bare-metal workers on {rh-openstack} 16.1. Clusters on {rh-openstack} 16.2 are not impacted by this issue. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2033953[*BZ#2033953*])
