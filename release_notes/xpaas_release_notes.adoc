== Known Issues for xPaaS Images

The following are the current known issues along with any known workarounds:

*JWS*

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-57[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-57]: Tomcat's access log valve logs to file in container instead of
stdout
+
Due to this issue, the logging data is not available for the central logging
facility. To work around this issue, use the `oc exec` command to get the
contents of the log file.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-153[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-153]: `mvn clean` in JWS STI can fail
+
Cleaning up after a build in JWS STI is not possible, because the Maven command
`mvn clean` fails. This is due to Maven not being able to build the object model
during startup.
+
To work around this issue, add Red Hat and JBoss repositories into the
*_pom.xml_* file of the application if the application uses dependencies from
there.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-156[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-156]: Datasource realm configuration is incorrect for JWS
+
It is not possible to do correct JNDI lookup for datasources in the current JWS
image if an invalid combination of datasource and realm properties is defined.
If a datasource is configured in the *_context.xml_* file and a realm in the
*_server.xml_* file, then the *_server.xml_* file's `*localDataSource*` property
should be set to *true*.

*EAP*

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-61[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-61]: JPA application fails to start when the database is not available
+
JPA applications fail to deploy in the EAP OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 image if an
underlying database instance that the EAP instance relies on is not available at
the start of the deployment. The EAP application tries to contact the database
for initialization, but because it is not available, the server starts but the
application fails to deploy.
+
There are no known workarounds available at this stage for this issue.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-158[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-158]: Continuous HornetQ errors after scale down "Failed to create netty
connection"
+
In the EAP image, an application not using messaging complains about messaging
errors related to HornetQ when being scaled.
+
Since there are no configuration options to disable messaging to work around
this issue, simply include the *_standalone-openshift.xml_* file within the
source of the image and remove or alter the following lines related to
messaging:
+
----
Line 18:

<!-- ##MESSAGING_EXTENSION## -->

Line 318:

<!-- ##MESSAGING_SUBSYSTEM## -->
----

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-161[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-161]:
EAP pod serving requests before it joins cluster, some sessions reset after
failure
+
In a distributed web application deployed on an EAP image, a new container
starts serving requests before it joins the cluster.
+
There are no known workarounds available at this stage for this issue.

*EAP and JWS*

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-159[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-159]: Database pool configurations should contain validation SQL setting
+
In both the EAP and JWS images, when restarting a crashed database instance, the
connection pools contain stale connections.
+
To work around this issue, restart all instances in case of a database failure.

*Fuse Integration Services*

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/OSFUSE-112[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/OSFUSE-112]: karaf /deployments/karaf/bin/client CNFE org.apache.sshd.agent.SshAgent
+
Attempting to run the karaf client in the container to locally SSH to the karaf console fails.

+
Workaround: Adding both `*shell*` and `*ssh*` features make the client work. It will log the warning errors in the logs.
+
----
$ oc exec karaf-shell-1-bb9zu -- /deployments/karaf/bin/client osgi:list
----
+
These warnings are logged when trying to use the JBoss Fuse bin/client script to connect to the JBoss Fuse micro-container. This is an unusual case, since the container is supposed to contain only bundles and features required for a micro-service, and hence does not need to be managed extensively like a traditional JBoss Fuse install. Any changes made using commands in the remote shell will be temporary and not recorded in the micro-service's docker image.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/OSFUSE-190[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/OSFUSE-190]: cdi-camel-jetty S2I template incorrect default service name, breaking cdi-camel-http
+
The cdi-camel-http quickstart expects the cdi-camel-jetty service to be named `*qs-cdi-camel-jetty*`. In the cdi-camel-jetty template however, the service is named `*s2i-qs-cdi-camel-jetty*` instead by default. This causes the cdi-camel-http to output this error when both are deployed using the S2I with default values.

+
Workaround: Set the cdi-camel-jetty SERVICE_NAME template parameter to `*qs-cdi-camel-jetty*`.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/OSFUSE-193[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/OSFUSE-193]: karaf-camel-rest-sql template service name too long
+
oc process karaf-camel-rest-sql template fails with the following error:
The Service "s2i-qs-karaf-camel-rest-sql" is invalid.
SUREFIRE-859: metadata.name: invalid value 's2i-qs-karaf-camel-rest-sql', Details: must be a DNS 952 label (at most 24 characters, matching regex [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?): e.g. "my-name"
deploymentconfig "s2i-quickstart-karaf-camel-rest-sql" created

+
Workaround: Set SERVICE_NAME template parameter to `*karaf-camel-rest-sql*`.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/OSFUSE-195[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/OSFUSE-195]: karaf-camel-amq template should have parameter to configure A-MQ service name
+
The application template for A-MQ deployments uses a suffix for every transport type to distinguish. Hence there should be a configurable parameter for setting the service name as environment parameter `*A_MQ_SERVICE_NAME*`.

*A-MQ*

There are no known issues in the A-MQ image.
