== New features

[id="dashboard-updates"]
=== New RHACS Dashboard

{product-title-short} introduces a new top-level Dashboard designed to provide quick access to the data you need. It provides additional navigation shortcuts and a panel of actionable widgets that are easy to filter and customize so that you can focus on what matters most to you. We would love to hear your feedback to help us shape future enhancements, including which widgets you would like on the Dashboard and how you would like to customize them.

The changes to the Dashboard in {product-title-short} 3.71 are described in the following section. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_security_for_kubernetes/3.71/html/operating/view-dashboard[Viewing the Dashboard].

[id="status-bar-links"]
==== Status bar hyperlinks

The *Status Bar* provides at-a-glance numerical counters for key resources. The counters reflect what is visible with your current access scope, which is defined by the roles associated with your user profile. These counters are clickable, providing fast access to desired list view pages as follows:

[options="header"]
|====================================================================================================================
| Counter     | Destination                                                           
| Clusters    | Platform Configuration → Clusters                                      
| Nodes       | Configuration Management → Application & Infrastructure → Nodes        
| Violations  | Violations main menu                                                   
| Deployments | Configuration Management → Application & Infrastructure → Deployments  
| Images      | Vulnerability Management → Dashboard → Images                         
| Secrets     | Configuration Management → Application & Infrastructure → Secrets      
|====================================================================================================================

[id="dashboard-filter"]
==== Dashboard filter

The Dashboard now includes a top-level filter that applies simultaneously to all widgets. You can select one or more clusters, and one or more namespaces within selected clusters. When no clusters or namespaces are selected, the view automatically switches to *All*.  Any change to the filter is immediately reflected by all widgets, limiting the data they present to the selected scope. The Dashboard filter does not affect the *Status Bar*.

[id="widget-options"]
==== Widget options

Some widgets are now customizable to help you focus on what matters the most to you. Widgets offer different controls that change how the data is sorted, allow you to filter the data, and help you to customize the widget’s output. 

Widgets offer two ways to customize different aspects:

* An *Options* menu, when present,  provides specific options applicable to that widget. 
* A *dynamic axis legend*, when present, allows you to filter data by hiding one or more of the axis categories. For example, in the *Policy violations by category* widget, you can click on a severity to include or exclude respective violations from the data.
 
[NOTE]
====
Individual widget customization settings are short lived and are reset to the system default upon leaving the Dashboard.
====

[id="new-widgets"]
==== Actionable widgets

The Dashboard provides the following actionable widgets:

* *Policy violations by severity*: This widget shows the distribution of violations across severity levels for the Dashboard-filtered scope. Clicking a *severity level* in the chart takes you to the *Violations* page, filtered for that severity and scope. It also lists the three most recent violations of a *Critical* level policy within the scope you defined in the Dashboard filter. Clicking a specific violation takes you directly to the *Violations* detail page for that violation.

* *Images at most risk*: This widget lists the top six vulnerable images within the Dashboard-filtered scope, sorted by their computed risk priority, along with the number of critical and important CVEs they contain. Click an image name to go directly to the *Image Findings* page under *Vulnerability Management*. Use the *Options* menu to focus on fixable CVEs, or further focus on active images. 
+
[NOTE]
====
When clusters or namespaces have been selected in the Dashboard filter, the data displayed is already filtered to active images, or images that are being used by deployments within the filtered scope. 
====

* *Deployments at most risk*: This widget provides the information that was previously available in the *Top risky deployments* widget, but displays additional information such as the resource location (cluster and namespace) and the risk priority score. Additionally, you can click on a deployment to view risk information about the deployment; for example, its policy violations and vulnerabilities. 

* *Aging images*: Older images present a higher security risk as they can contain vulnerabilities that have already been addressed. If older images are active, they can expose deployments to exploits. This widget allows you to quickly assess your security posture and identify offending images. You can use the default ranges or customize the age intervals with your own values. You can view both inactive and active images or use the Dashboard filter to focus on a particular area for active images. You can then click on an age group in this widget to view only those images in the *Vulnerability Management* -> *Images* page.
  
* *Policy violations by category*: This widget can help you gain insights about the challenges your organization is facing in complying with security policies, by analyzing which types of policies are violated more than others. The widget shows the five policy categories of highest interest. Explore the *Options* menu for different ways to slice the data. You can filter the data to focus exclusively on deploy or runtime violations. You can also change the sorting mode. By default, the data is sorted by the number of violations within the highest severity first. Therefore, all categories with critical policies will appear before categories without critical policies. The other sorting mode considers the total number of violations regardless of severity. As some categories contain no critical policies (for example, “Docker CIS”), the two sorting modes can provide significantly different views, offering additional insight. Click on a severity level at the bottom of the graph to include or exclude that level from the data, potentially resulting in a different top five selection, as well as a different ranking order. Data is filtered to the scope selected by the Dashboard filter.

* *Compliance by standard*: The *Compliance* widget is an improvement over a similar widget included in the past. It uses the Dashboard filter, allowing you to focus on areas that matter to you the most. The widget lists the top or bottom six compliance benchmarks, depending on sort order. Select *Options* to sort by the respective coverage percentage. Click on one of the benchmark labels or graphs to go directly to the *Compliance Controls* page, filtered by the Dashboard scope and the selected benchmark. 

[id="removed-widgets"]
==== Removed widgets

* *Individual Policy Category widgets*: Previous product versions included a set of widgets showing the distribution of policy violations across severity levels, per policy category. The widgets were automatically generated for every policy category. To view similar data, use the *Policy violations by category* widget and click a category to get to the same *Violations page*.
* *Active violations by time*: Previous product versions included a line graph depicting the number of violations over a seven-day period. This graph has been removed with the understanding that more comprehensive historical metrics are desired. This topic is being considered as a product enhancement request.

[id="privilege-escalation"]
=== New default policy for privilege escalation

This new default policy detects if a deployment is running with a container that has `allowPrivilegeEscalation` set to `true`. This policy is enabled by default. The privilege escalation setting is enabled in Kubernetes pods by default. A container process that can run with more privileges than its parent process can allow the container to run with unintended privileges, creating a security risk. This policy provides an alert so that you can verify whether privileged escalation is required. For example, it may be necessary if the required privileges cannot be provided with a subset of other controls.

[id="externally-exposed-service"]
=== New default policy for externally exposed service

This new policy detects if a deployment has any service that is externally exposed through any methods. The policy is disabled by default. Deployments with services exposed outside of the cluster are at a higher risk of attempted intrusions because they are reachable outside of the cluster. This policy provides an alert so that you can verify that service exposure outside of the cluster is required. If the service is only needed for intra-cluster communication, use service type `ClusterIP`.

[id="multiple-roles-user-group"]
=== Ability to assign multiple RHACS roles to users and groups

Role-based Access Control (RBAC) in {product-title-short} has been enhanced to allow you to assign multiple roles to a single user or group. Previously, a key-value pair could only be assigned to a single role. Now, that key-value pair can be assigned to multiple {product-title-short} roles. This change allows you to reuse existing roles and simplifies role management. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_security_for_kubernetes/3.71/html/operating/managing-user-access#manage-role-based-access-control[Managing RBAC in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes].


[id="network-policies-list"]
=== List of network policies in Deployment tab for violations 

A new information section has been added to help resolve a "missing Kubernetes network policy" violation. When viewing a violation, select the *Deployment* tab and scroll to the new *Network policy* section. It lists all the Kubernetes network policies applicable to the namespace of the offending deployment. You can use this list to verify which network policies exist in the namespace to help you determine why a deployment was flagged as missing a network policy. 


[id="alpine-316"]
=== Alpine 3.16 support
Scanner now supports Alpine 3.16.

== Enhancements

[id="roxctl-image-scan"]
=== Change to roxctl image scan behavior 

The default value for the `--include-snoozed` option of the `roxctl image scan` command is set to `false`. If the `--include-snoozed` option is set to `false`, the scan does not include snoozed CVEs.

[id="diagnostic-bundle-update"]
=== Update to diagnostic bundles

You can create diagnostic bundles to assist Red Hat in supporting you with {product-title-short}. This diagnostic bundle has been enhanced to include notifiers, auth providers and auth provider groups, access control roles with attached permission set and access scope, and system configuration information. Users with the `DebugLogs` permission can read listed entities from a generated diagnostic bundle regardless of their respective permissions. 

[id="ocp4-cis-benchmarks"]
=== Align OCP4-CIS scanning benchmarks control numbers

The CIS control number has been added to compliance scan results to enable customers to reference the original control from the CIS benchmark standard *(ROX-9986)*.

[id="notable-tech-changes-371"]
== Notable technical changes

[id="ebpf-collection-default"]
=== eBPF is now the default collection method

In {product-title-short} 3.71, Red Hat has updated the default collection method for Collector to eBPF. Using eBPF for data collection takes advantage of modern kernel features and improves performance over kernel modules by 25%. Additionally, it reduces processed `syscall` events by 99%.


[NOTE]
====
You should switch to kernel module collection if you are using:

* {ocp} version 3.11, which uses {op-system-base-full} 7. It does not support the features required for performance improvement.
* SELinux on {op-system-base} 7, which may also prevent the loading of eBPF probes.
====

[id="stackrox-io-registry-shutdown"]
=== Shutdown of Stackrox image registry sites

The image registries hosted at the `stackrox.io` and `collector.stackrox.io` addresses were shut down. Images for {product-title-short} are available from `registry.redhat.io`.



[id="deprecation-notices-371"]

[id="deprecated-features-371"]
=== Deprecated features

* Permissions for permission sets will be grouped for simplification. The following list describes the new permissions and indicates the deprecated permissions that will be removed in a future release:
** The `Access` permission will replace the following permissions: `AuthPlugin`, `AuthProvider`, `Group`, `Licenses`, `Role`, and `User`.
** The `DeploymentExtension` permission will replace the following permissions: `Indicator`, `NetworkBaseline`, `ProcessWhitelist`, and `Risk`.
** The `Integration` permission will deprecate the following permissions: `APIToken`, `BackupPlugins`, `ImageIntegration`, `Notifier`, and `SignatureIntegration`.
** The `Image` permission will replace the permission `ImageComponent`.
* Previously, groups were retrieved by the field props (`props.authProviderId`, `props.key`, `props.value`). This field will be replaced by the new `props.id` field. Use the `props.id` field to retrieve groups in the Application Programming Interface (API). Note the following:
** Retrieval using the `props` fields will be removed in version a future release.
** Until removal, retrieval using the `props` field will work if the result is unambiguous (no more than one group is found with the `props` field).
* `/v1/cves/suppress` and `/v1/cves/unsuppress` have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. After these are removed:
** Use `/v1/imagecves/suppress` and `/v1/imagecves/unsuppress` to snooze and unsnooze image vulnerabilities.
** Use `/v1/nodecves/suppress` and `/v1/nodecves/unsuppress` to snooze and unsnooze node and host vulnerabilities.
** Use `/v1/clustercves/suppress` and `/v1/clustercves/unsuppress` to snooze and unsnooze platform (Kubernetes, Istio, and {ocp}) vulnerabilities.
* *Updated 30 August 2022:* 
** The `ids` field in the `/v1/cves/suppress` and `/v1/cves/unsuppress` API payload will be renamed to `cves` in the {product-title-short} 3.73 release.
** The `cves.ids` field of the `storage.VulnerabilityRequest` object in the response of `VulnerabilityRequestService` endpoints will be renamed to `cves.cves` in the {product-title-short} 3.73 release.

[id="removed-features-371"]
=== Removed features

* Anchore, Tenable, and Docker Trusted Registry integrations: The {product-title-short} scanner supersedes these integrations.
* External authorization plug-in for scoped access control: Use the existing in-product scoped access control.
* `FROM` option in the `Disallowed Dockerfile line` policy field: Any policies containing the `Disallowed Dockerfile line` policy field with the `FROM` option must be updated to remove those policy sections.
* `PodSecurityPolicies` (PSPs): PSPs can be disabled when generating deployment bundles and when configuring the Helm charts. The Helm charts also support auto-sensing availability of the PodSecurityPolicies API. You must disable PSPs when deploying to Kubernetes version 1.25 or later.


[id="bug-fixes-371"]
== Bug fixes

* The node affinity setting in Helm templates has been updated to discourage {product-title-short} pods such as Central, Sensor, Scanner, and Scanner-db being scheduled on control plane nodes. (*ROX-11533*)
* Because the `FROM` option in the `Disallowed Dockerfile line` policy field has been deprecated, this update removed the option to create or edit policies that include this field. (*ROX-10925*)

[id="upgrade-roxctl-scanner"]
== Upgrade instructions for roxctl users
