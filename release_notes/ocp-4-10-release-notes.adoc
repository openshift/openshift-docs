[id="ocp-4-10-installation-and-upgrade-vsphere-provisioning"]
==== Thin provisioning support for VMware vSphere cluster installation

{product-title} {product-version} introduces support for thin-provisioned disks when you install a cluster using installer-provisioned infrastructure. You can provision disks as `thin`, `thick`, or `eagerZeroedThick`. For more information about disk provisioning modes in VMware vSphere, see xref:../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-customizations.adoc#installation-configuration-parameters_installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-customizations[Installation configuration parameters].

[id="ocp-4-10-installation-and-upgrade-aws-ami"]
==== Installing a cluster into an Amazon Web Services GovCloud region

{op-system-first} Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are now available for AWS GovCloud regions. The availability of these AMIs improves the installation process because you are no longer required to upload a custom RHCOS AMI to deploy a cluster.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-government-region.adoc#installing-aws-government-region[Installing a cluster on AWS into a government region].

[id="ocp-4-10-installation-and-upgrade-tagrole"]
==== Using a custom AWS IAM role for instance profiles

Beginning with {product-title} {product-version}, if you configure a cluster with an existing IAM role, the installation program no longer adds the `shared` tag to the role when deploying the cluster. This enhancement improves the installation process for organizations that want to use a custom IAM role, but whose security policies prevent the use of the `shared` tag.

[id="ocp-4-10-installation-vsphere-csi"]
==== CSI driver installation on vSphere clusters

To install a CSI driver on a cluster running on vSphere, you must have the following components installed:

* Virtual hardware version 15 or greater

[id="ocp-4-10-conditional-updates"]
==== Conditional updates

{product-title} 4.10 adds support for consuming conditional update paths provided by the OpenShift Update Service.
Conditional update paths convey identified risks and the conditions under which those risks apply to clusters.
The Administrator perspective on the web console only offers recommended upgrade paths for which the cluster does not match known risks.
However, OpenShift CLI (`oc`) 4.10 or later can be used to display additional upgrade paths for {product-title} 4.10 clusters.
Associated risk information including supporting documentation references is displayed with the paths.
The administrator may review the referenced materials and choose to perform the supported, but no longer recommended, upgrade.

For more information, see xref:../updating/understanding-upgrade-channels-release.adoc#conditional-updates-overview_understanding-upgrade-channels-releases[Conditional updates] and xref:../updating/updating-cluster-cli.adoc#update-conditional-upgrade-pathupdating-cluster-cli[Updating along a conditional upgrade path].

[id="ocp-4-10-security"]
=== Security and compliance

Information regarding new features, enhancements, and bug fixes for security and compliance components can be found in the xref:../security/compliance_operator/compliance-operator-release-notes.adoc[Compliance Operator] and xref:../security/file_integrity_operator/file-integrity-operator-release-notes.adoc[File Integrity Operator] release notes.

For more information about security and compliance, see xref:../security/index.adoc[{product-title} security and compliance].

[id="ocp-4-10-networking"]
=== Networking

[id="ocp-4-10-networking-dual-stack-api-change"]
==== Dual-stack services require that ipFamilyPolicy is specified

When you create a service that uses multiple IP address families, you must explicitly specify `ipFamilyPolicy: PreferDualStack` or `ipFamilyPolicy: RequireDualStack` in your Service object definition. This change breaks backwards compatibility with earlier releases of {product-title}.

For more information, see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2045576[BZ#2045576].

[id="ocp-4-10-change-cluster-network-mtu-after-cluster-installation"]
==== Change cluster network MTU after cluster installation

After cluster installation, if you are using the OpenShift SDN cluster network provider or the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network provider, you can change your hardware MTU and your cluster network MTU values. Changing the MTU across the cluster is disruptive and requires that each node is rebooted several times. For more information, see xref:../networking/changing-cluster-network-mtu.adoc#changing-cluster-network-mtu[Changing the cluster network MTU].

[id="ocp-4-10-redfish-events"]
==== Low-latency Redfish hardware event delivery (Technology Preview)

{product-title} now provides a hardware event proxy that enables applications running on bare-metal clusters to respond quickly to Redfish hardware events, such as hardware changes and failures.

The hardware event proxy supports a publish-subscribe service that allows relevant applications to consume hardware events detected by Redfish. The proxy must be running on hardware that supports Redfish v1.8 and higher. An Operator manages the lifecycle of the `hw-event-proxy` container.

You can use a REST API to develop applications to consume and respond to events such as breaches of temperature thresholds, fan failure, disk loss, power outages, and memory failure. Reliable end-to-end messaging without persistent stores is based on the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). The latency of the messaging service is in the 10 millisecond range.

[NOTE]
====
This feature is supported for single node OpenShift clusters only.
====

[id="ocp-4-10-networking-ovn-gateway-config"]
==== OVN-Kubernetes support for gateway configuration

The OVN-Kubernetes CNI network provider adds support for configuring how egress traffic is sent to the node gateway.
By default, egress traffic is processed in OVN to exit the cluster and traffic is not affected by specialized routes in the kernel routing table.

This enhancement adds a `gatewayConfig.routingViaHost` field.
With this update, the field can be set at runtime as a post-installation activity and when it is set to `true`, egress traffic is sent from pods to the host networking stack.
This update benefits highly specialized installations and applications that rely on manually configured routes in the kernel routing table.

This enhancement has an interaction with the Open vSwitch hardware offloading feature.
With this update, when the `gatewayConfig.routingViaHost` field is set to `true`, you do not receive the performance benefits of the offloading because egress traffic is processed by the host networking stack.

For configuration information, see xref:../networking/cluster-network-operator.adoc#nw-operator-configuration-parameters-for-ovn-sdn_cluster-network-operator[Configuration for the OVN-Kubernetes CNI cluster network provider].

[id="ocp-4-10-networking-metrics"]
==== Enhancements to networking metrics

The following metrics are now available for clusters.
The metric names that start with `sdn_controller` are unique to the OpenShift SDN CNI network provider.
The metric names that start with `ovn` are unique to the OVN-Kubernetes CNI network provider:

* `network_attachment_definition_instances{networks="egress-router"}`
* `openshift_unidle_events_total`
* `ovn_controller_bfd_run`
* `ovn_controller_ct_zone_commit`
* `ovn_controller_flow_generation`
* `ovn_controller_flow_installation`
* `ovn_controller_if_status_mgr`
* `ovn_controller_if_status_mgr_run`
* `ovn_controller_if_status_mgr_update`
* `ovn_controller_integration_bridge_openflow_total`
* `ovn_controller_ofctrl_seqno_run`
* `ovn_controller_patch_run`
* `ovn_controller_pinctrl_run`
* `ovnkube_master_ipsec_enabled`
* `ovnkube_master_num_egress_firewall_rules`
* `ovnkube_master_num_egress_firewalls`
* `ovnkube_master_num_egress_ips`
* `ovnkube_master_pod_first_seen_lsp_created_duration_seconds`
* `ovnkube_master_pod_lsp_created_port_binding_duration_seconds`
* `ovnkube_master_pod_port_binding_chassis_port_binding_up_duration_seconds`
* `ovnkube_master_pod_port_binding_port_binding_chassis_duration_seconds`
* `sdn_controller_num_egress_firewall_rules`
* `sdn_controller_num_egress_firewalls`
* `sdn_controller_num_egress_ips`

The `ovnkube_master_resource_update_total` metric is removed for the 4.10 release.

[id="ocp-4-10-networkobservability-switch"]
==== Switching between YAML view and a web console form

* Previously, changes were not retained when switching between *YAML view* and *Form view* on the web console. Additionally, after switching to *YAML view*, you could not return to *Form view*. With this update, you can now easily switch between *YAML view* and *Form view* on the web console without losing changes.

[id="ocp-4-10-networkobservability-targeted-pods"]
==== Listing pods targeted by network policies
When using the network policy functionality in the {product-title} web console, the pods affected by a policy are listed. The list changes as the combined namespace and pod selectors in these policy sections are modified:

* Peer definition
* Rule definition
* Ingress
* Egress

The list of impacted pods includes only those pods accessible by the user.

[id="ocp-4-10-networking-must-gather-tcpdump"]
==== Enhancement to must-gather to simplify network tracing

The `oc adm must-gather` command is enhanced in a way that simplifies collecting network packet captures.

Previously, `oc adm must-gather` could start a single debug pod only.
With this enhancement, you can start a debug pod on multiple nodes at the same time.

You can use the enhancement to run packet captures on multiple nodes at the same time to simplify troubleshooting network communication issues.
A new `--node-selector` argument provides a way to identify which nodes you are collecting packet captures for.

For more information, see xref:../support/gathering-cluster-data.adoc#support-network-trace-methods_gathering-cluster-data[Network trace methods] and xref:../support/gathering-cluster-data.adoc#support-collecting-host-network-trace_gathering-cluster-data[Collecting a host network trace].
[id="ocp-4-10-pod-level-bonding"]
==== Pod-level bonding for secondary networks (Technology Preview)
Bonding at the pod level is vital to enable workloads inside pods that require high availability and more throughput. With pod-level bonding, you can create a bond interface from multiple single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) virtual function interfaces in kernel mode interface. The SR-IOV virtual functions are passed into the pod and attached to a kernel driver.

Scenarios where pod-level bonding is required include creating a bond interface from multiple SR-IOV virtual functions on different physical functions. Creating a bond interface from two different physical functions on the host can be used to achieve high availability at pod level.

[NOTE]
====
The current functionality of Bond CNI is available only in active-backup mode. For further details, see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2037214[*BZ#2037214*].
====

[id="ocp-4-10-egress-ip-support-public-clouds"]
==== Egress IP address support for clusters installed on public clouds

As a cluster administrator, you can associate one or more egress IP addresses with a namespace. An egress IP address ensures that a consistent source IP address is associated with traffic from a particular namespace that is leaving the cluster.

For the OVN-Kubernetes and OpenShift SDN cluster network providers, you can configure an egress IP address on the following public cloud providers:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)

[id="ocp-4-10-host-firmware-settings"]
==== Support for modifying host firmware settings

{product-title} supports the `HostFirmwareSettings` and `FirmwareSchema` resources. When deploying {product-title} on bare metal hosts, there are times when you need to make changes to the host either before or after provisioning. This can include inspecting the host's firmware and BIOS details. There are two new resources that you can use with the Bare Metal Operator (BMO):

* `HostFirmwareSettings`: You can use the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource to retrieve and manage the BIOS settings for a host. The resource contains the complete BIOS configuration returned from the baseboard management controller (BMC). Whereas, the firmware field in the `BareMetalHost` resource returns three vendor-independent fields, the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource typically comprises many BIOS settings of vendor-specific fields per host model.

* `FirmwareSchema`: You can use the `FirmwareSchema` to identify the host's modifiable BIOS values and limits when making changes to host firmware settings.

[id="ocp-4-10-copied-csvs"]
==== Disabling copied CSVs to support large clusters

When an Operator is installed by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), a simplified copy of its cluster service version (CSV) is created in every namespace that the Operator is configured to watch. These CSVs are known as copied CSVs; they identify controllers that are actively reconciling resource events in a given namespace.

On large clusters, with namespaces and installed Operators potentially in the hundreds or thousands, copied CSVs can consume an untenable amount of resources, such as OLM’s memory usage, cluster etcd limits, and networking bandwidth. To support these larger clusters, cluster administrators can now disable copied CSVs for Operators that are installed with the `AllNamespaces` mode.

For more details, see xref:../operators/admin/olm-config.adoc#olm-config[Configuring Operator Lifecycle Manager features].

[id="ocp-4-10-olm-dependencies"]
==== Generic and complex constraints for dependencies

Operators with specific dependency requirements can now use complex constraints or requirement expressions. The new `olm.constraint` bundle property holds dependency constraint information. A message field allows Operator authors to convey high-level details about why a particular constraint was used.

Starting in {product-title} 4.10 as a Technology Preview feature, the Operator SDK includes the Hybrid Helm Operator to enhance the existing Helm-based support abilities through Go APIs. Operator authors can generate an Operator project beginning with a Helm chart, and then add advanced, event-based logic to the Helm reconciler in Go language. Authors can use Go to continue adding new APIs and custom resource definitions (CRDs) in the same project.

For more details, see xref:../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-monitoring-prometheus.adoc#osdk-monitoring-prometheus[Exposing custom metrics for Ansible-based Operators].

==== Object pruning for Go-based Operators

The `operator-lib` pruning utility lets Go-based Operators clean up objects, such as jobs or pods, that can stay in the cluster and use resources. The utility includes common pruning strategies for Go-based Operators. Operator authors can also use the utility to create custom hooks and strategies.

For more information about the pruning utility, see xref:../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-pruning-utility.adoc#osdk-pruning-utility_osdk-pruning-utility[Object pruning utility for Go-based Operators].

==== Digest-based bundle for disconnected environments

With this enhancement, Operator SDK can now package an Operator project into a bundle that works in a disconnected environment with Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). Operator authors can run the `make bundle` command and set `USE_IMAGE_DIGESTS` to `true` to automatically update your Operator image reference to a digest rather than a tag. To use the command, you must use environment variables to replace hard-coded related image references.

=== Builds

* With this update, you can use CSI volumes in OpenShift Builds, which is a Technology Preview feature. This feature relies on the newly introduced Shared Resource CSI Driver and the Insights Operator to import {op-system-base} Simple Content Access (SCA) certificates. For example, by using this feature, you can run entitled builds with `SharedSecret` objects and install entitled RPM packages during builds rather than copying your {op-system-base} subscription credentials and certificates into the builds' namespaces.

[id="ocp-4-10-mco-config-drift"]
==== Enhanced configuration drift detection

With this enhancement, the Machine Config Daemon (MCD) now checks nodes for configuration drift if a filesystem write event occurs for any of the files specified in the machine config and before a new machine config is applied, in addition to node bootup. Previously, the MCD checked for configuration drift only at node bootup. This change was made because node reboots do not occur frequently enough to avoid the problems caused by configuration drift until an administrator can correct the issue.

Configuration drift occurs when the on-disk state of a node differs from what is configured in the machine config. The Machine Config Operator (MCO) uses the MCD to check nodes for configuration drift and, if detected, sets that node and machine config pool (MCP) to `degraded`.

For more information about configuration drift, see xref:../post_installation_configuration/machine-configuration-tasks.adoc#machine-config-drift-detection_post-install-machine-configuration-tasks[Understanding configuration drift detection].

The monitoring stack for this release includes the following new and modified features.

[id="ocp-4-10-monitoring-stack-components-and-dependencies"]
==== Monitoring stack components and dependencies

Updates to versions of monitoring stack components and dependencies include the following:

* Alertmanager to 0.23.0
* Grafana to 8.3.4
* kube-state-metrics to 2.3.0
* node-exporter to 1.3.1
* prom-label-proxy to 0.4.0
* Prometheus to 2.32.1
* Prometheus adapter to 0.9.1

[id="ocp-4-10-monitoring-new-metrics-targets-page-in-web-console"]
==== New page for metrics targets in the {product-title} web console

A new *Metrics Targets* page in the {product-title} web console shows targets for default {product-title} projects and for user-defined projects. You can use this page to view, search, and filter the endpoints that are currently targeted for scraping, which helps you to identify and troubleshoot problems.

[id="ocp-4-10-monitoring-components-use-tls-authentication-for-metrics"]
==== Monitoring components updated to use TLS authentication for metrics collection

With this release, all monitoring components are now configured to use mutual TLS authentication, rather than Bearer Token static authentication for metrics collection. TLS authentication is more resilient to Kubernetes API outages and decreases the load on the Kubernetes API.

[id="ocp-4-10-monitoring-updated-cmo-to-use-global-tls-profile"]
==== Cluster Monitoring Operator updated to use the global TLS security profile

With this release, the Cluster Monitoring Operator components now honor the global {product-title} `tlsSecurityProfile` settings.
The following components and services now use the TLS security profile:

* Alertmanager pods (ports 9092 and 9097)
* kube-state-metrics pod (ports 8443 and 9443)
* openshift-state-metrics pod (ports 8443 and 9443)
* node-exporter pods (port 9100)
* Grafana pod (port 3002)
* prometheus-adapter pods (port 6443)
* prometheus-k8s pods (ports 9092 and 10902)
* Thanos query pods (ports 9092, 9093 and 9094)
* Prometheus Operator (ports 8080 and 8443)
* telemeter-client pod (port 8443)

If you have enabled user-defined monitoring, the following pods now use the profile:

* prometheus-user-workload pods (ports 9091 and 10902)
* prometheus-operator pod (ports 8080 and 8443)

[id="ocp-4-10-monitoring-changes-to-alerting-rules"]
==== Changes to alerting rules

* *New*
** Added a `namespace` label to all Thanos alerting rules.
** Added the `openshift_io_alert_source="platform"` label to all platform alerts.


* *Changed*
** Renamed `AggregatedAPIDown` to `KubeAggregatedAPIDown`.
** Renamed `AggregatedAPIErrors` to `KubeAggregatedAPIErrors`.
** Removed the `HighlyAvailableWorkloadIncorrectlySpread` alert.
** Improved the description of the `KubeMemoryOvercommit` alert.
** Improved `NodeFilesystemSpaceFillingUp` alerts to make it consistent with the Kubernetes garbage collection thresholds.
** Excluded `ReadOnlyMany` volumes from the `KubePersistentVolumeFillingUp` alerts.
** Extended `PrometheusOperator` alerts to include the Prometheus operator running in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace.
** Replaced the `ThanosSidecarPrometheusDown` and `ThanosSidecarUnhealthy` alerts by `ThanosSidecarNoConnectionToStartedPrometheus`.
** Changed the severity of `KubeletTooManyPods` from `warning` to `info`.
** Enabled exclusion of specific persistent volumes from `KubePersistentVolumeFillingUp` alerts by adding the `alerts.k8s.io/KubePersistentVolumeFillingUp: disabled` label to a persistent volume resource.


[NOTE]
=====
Red Hat does not guarantee backward compatibility for recording rules or alerting rules.
=====

[id="ocp-4-10-monitoring-changes-to-metrics"]
==== Changes to metrics

* Pod-centric cAdvisor metrics available at the slice level have been dropped.
* The following metrics are now exposed:
** `kube_poddisruptionbudget_labels`
** `kube_persistentvolumeclaim_labels`
** `kube_persistentvolume_labels`
* Metrics with the name `kube_*annotation` have been removed from `kube-state-metrics`.

[NOTE]
=====
Red Hat does not guarantee backward compatibility for metrics.
=====

[id="ocp-4-10-monitoring-added-hard-anti-affinity-rules-and-pod-distruption-budgets"]
==== Added hard anti-affinity rules and pod disruption budgets for certain components

With this release, hard anti-affinity rules and pod disruption budgets have been enabled for the following monitoring components to reduce downtime during patch upgrades:

* Alertmanager
+
[NOTE]
=====
As part of this change, the number of Alertmanager replicas has been reduced from three to two. However, the persistent volume claim (PVC) for the removed third replica is not automatically removed as part of the upgrade process. If you have configured persistent storage for Alertmanager, you can remove this PVC manually from the Cluster Monitoring Operator. See the "Known Issues" section for more information.
=====
+
* Prometheus adapter
* Prometheus
* Thanos Querier

If you have enabled user-defined monitoring, the following components also use these rules and budgets:

* Prometheus
* Thanos Ruler

[id="ocp-4-10-monitoring-alert-routing-user-defined-project-tech-preview"]
==== Alert routing for user-defined projects (Technology Preview)

This release introduces a Technology Preview feature in which an administrator can enable alert routing for user-defined projects monitoring. Users can then add and configure alert routing for their user-defined projects.


[id="ocp-4-10-monitoring-alertmanager"]
==== Alertmanager

Access to the third-party Alertmanager web user interface from the {product-title} route has been removed.

[id="ocp-4-10-monitoring-prometheus"]
==== Prometheus

* {product-title} cluster administrators can now configure query logging for Prometheus.
* Access to the third-party Prometheus web user interface is deprecated and will be removed in a future {product-title} release.

[id="ocp-4.10-monitoring-prometheus-adapter"]
==== Prometheus adapter

* The Prometheus adapter now uses the Thanos Querier API rather than the Prometheus API.
* {product-title} cluster administrators can now configure audit logs for the Prometheus adapter.

[id="ocp-4-10-monitoring-thanos-querier"]
==== Thanos Querier

* Access to the third-party Thanos Querier web user interface from the {product-title} route has been removed.
* The `/api/v1/labels`, `/api/v1/label/*/values`, and `/api/v1/series` endpoints on the Thanos Querier tenancy port are now exposed.
* {product-title} cluster administrators can now configure query logging.

[id="ocp-4-10-monitoring-thanos-ruler"]

* If user workload monitoring is enabled, access to the third-party Thanos Ruler web user interface from the {product-title} route has been removed.


[id="ocp-4-10-monitoring-grafana"]
==== Grafana

Access to the third-party Grafana web user interface is deprecated and will be removed in a future {product-title} release.

[id="ocp-4-10-scalability-and-performance"]
=== Scalability and performance

[id="ocp-4-10-SRO-metrics"]
==== New Special Resource Operator metrics

The Special Resource Operator (SRO) now exposes metrics to help you watch the health of your SRO custom resources and objects. For more information, see xref:../hardware_enablement/psap-special-resource-operator.adoc#special-resource-operator-metrics_special-resource-operator[Prometheus Special Resource Operator metrics].

[id="ocp-4-10-sro-crd-field"]
==== Special Resource Operator custom resource definition fields

Using `oc explain` for  Special Resource Operator (SRO) now provides online documentation for SRO custom resource definitions (CRD). This enhancement provides better specifics for CRD fields. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2031875[*BZ#2031875*])

[id="ocp-4-10-nto-metrics"]
==== New Node Tuning Operator metric added to Telemetry

A Node Tuning Operator (NTO) metric is now added to Telemetry. Follow the procedure in xref:../support/remote_health_monitoring/showing-data-collected-by-remote-health-monitoring.adoc#showing-data-collected-from-the-cluster_showing-data-collected-by-remote-health-monitoring[Showing data collected by Telemetry] to see all the metrics collected by Telemetry.

[id="ocp-4-10-nfd-topology-updater"]
==== NFD Topology Updater is now available

The Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Topology Updater is a daemon responsible for examining allocated resources on a worker node. It accounts for resources that are available to be allocated to new pod on a per-zone basis, where a zone can be a Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) node. See xref:../hardware_enablement/psap-node-feature-discovery-operator.adoc#using-the-nfd-topology-updater_node-feature-discovery-operator[Using the NFD Topology Updater] for more information.

[id="ocp-4-10-hyperthreading-aware-CPU-manager-policy"]
==== Hyperthreading-aware CPU manager policy (Technology Preview)
Hyperthreading-aware CPU manager policy in {product-title} is now available without the need for extra tuning. The cluster administrator can enable this feature if required. Hyperthreads are abstracted by the hardware as logical processors. Hyperthreading allows a single physical processor to execute two heavyweight threads (processes) at the same time, dynamically sharing processor resources.

[id="ocp-4-10-backup-and-restore"]
=== Backup and restore

[id="ocp-4-10-dev-exp"]
=== Developer experience

[id="ocp-4-10-dev-exp-prune-deployments"]
==== Pruning deployment replica sets (Technology Preview)

This release introduces a Technology Preview flag `--replica-sets` to the `oc adm prune deployments` command. By default, only replication controllers are pruned with the `oc adm prune deployments` command. When you set `--replica-sets` to `true`, replica sets are also included in the pruning process.

For more information, see xref:../applications/pruning-objects.adoc#pruning-deployments_pruning-objects[Pruning deployment resources].

[id="ocp-4-10-insights-operator"]
=== Insights Operator

[id="ocp-4-10-insights-operator-sca"]
==== Importing simple content access certificates

In {product-title} 4.10, Insights Operator now imports your simple content access certificates from {console-redhat-com} by default.

For more information, see xref:../support/remote_health_monitoring/insights-operator-simple-access.adoc[Importing simple content access certificates with Insights Operator].

[id="ocp-4-10-insights-operator-data-collection-enhancements"]
==== Insights Operator data collection enhancements

To reduce the amount of data sent to Red Hat, Insights Operator only gathers information when certain conditions are met. For example, Insights Operator only gathers the Alertmanager logs when Alertmanager fails to send alert notifications.

In {product-title} 4.10, the Insights Operator collects the following additional information:

* (Conditional) The logs from pods where the `KubePodCrashlooping` and `KubePodNotReady` alerts are firing
* (Conditional) The Alertmanager logs when the `AlertmanagerClusterFailedToSendAlerts` or `AlertmanagerFailedToSendAlerts` alerts are firing
* Silenced alerts from Alertmanager
* The node logs from the journal unit (kubelet)
* The `CostManagementMetricsConfig` from clusters with `costmanagement-metrics-operator` installed
* The time series database status from the monitoring stack Prometheus instance
* Additional information about the {product-title} scheduler

With this additional information, Red Hat improves {product-title} functionality and enhances Insights Advisor recommendations.

[id="ocp-4-10-auth"]
=== Authentication and authorization

[id="ocp-4-10-auth-sync-group-membership"]
==== Syncing group membership from OpenID Connect identity providers

This release introduces support for synchronizing group membership from an OpenID Connect provider to {product-title} upon user login. You can enable this by configuring the `groups` claim in the {product-title} OpenID Connect identity provider configuration.

For more information, see xref:../authentication/identity_providers/configuring-oidc-identity-provider.adoc#identity-provider-oidc-CR_configuring-oidc-identity-provider[Sample OpenID Connect CRs].

[id="ocp-4-10-auth-oidc-providers"]
==== Additional supported OIDC providers

The Okta and Ping Identity OpenID Connect (OIDC) providers are now tested and supported with {product-title}.

For the full list of OIDC providers, see xref:../authentication/identity_providers/configuring-oidc-identity-provider.adoc#identity-provider-oidc-supported_configuring-oidc-identity-provider[Supported OIDC providers].

[id="ocp-4-10-oc-commands-obtain-credentials-from-podman-config"]
==== oc commands now obtain credentials from Podman configuration locations

Previously, `oc` commands that used the registry configuration, for example `oc registry login` or `oc image` commands, obtained credentials from Docker configuration locations. With {product-title} {product-version}, if a registry entry cannot be found in the default Docker configuration location, `oc` commands obtain the credentials from Podman configuration locations. You can set your preference to either `docker` or `podman` by using the `REGISTRY_AUTH_PREFERENCE` environment variable to prioritize the location.

Users also have the option to use the `REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE` environment variable, which serves as an alternative to the existing `--registry-config` CLI flag. The `REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE` environment variable is also compatible with `podman`.

[id="ocp-4-10-auth-gcp-workload-identity"]
==== Support for Google Cloud Platform Workload Identity

You can now use the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) utility `ccoctl` to configure the CCO to use the Google Cloud Platform Workload Identity. When the CCO is configured to use GCP Workload Identity, the in-cluster components can impersonate IAM service accounts using short-term, limited-privilege security credentials to components.

//For more information, see xr/ef:../authentication/managing_cloud_provider_credentials/cco-mode-gcp-workload-identity.adoc#cco-mode-gcp-workload-identity[Using manual mode with GCP Workload Identity].

[id="ocp-4-10-notable-technical-changes"]
== Notable technical changes

{product-title} {product-version} introduces the following notable technical changes.

// Note: use [discrete] for these sub-headings.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-10-TLS-subject-alternative-names-required"]
==== TLS X.509 certificates must have a Subject Alternative Name

X.509 certificates must have a properly set the Subject Alternative Name field.
If you update your cluster without this, you risk breaking your cluster or rendering it inaccessible.

In older versions of {product-title}, X.509 certificates worked without a Subject Alternative Name, so long as the Common Name field was set.
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.6/html/release_notes/ocp-4-6-release-notes#ocp-4-6-tls-common-name[This behavior was removed in {product-title} 4.6].

In some cases, certificates without a Subject Alternative Name continued to work in {product-title} 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, and 4.9.
Because it uses Kubernetes 1.23, {product-title} 4.10 does not allow this under any circumstances.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-10-cluster-cloud-controller-manager-operator"]
==== Cloud controller managers for additional cloud providers

The Kubernetes community plans to deprecate the Kubernetes controller manager in favor of using cloud controller managers to interact with underlying cloud platforms. As a result, there is no plan to add Kubernetes controller manager support for any new cloud platforms. The IBM Cloud implementation that is added in this release of {product-title} uses cloud controller managers.

In addition, this release supports using cloud controller managers for Google Cloud Platform (GCP), VMware vSphere, and Alibaba Cloud as a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview].

To learn more about the cloud controller manager, see the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller/[Kubernetes Cloud Controller Manager documentation].

To manage the cloud controller manager and cloud node manager deployments and lifecycles, use the Cluster Cloud Controller Manager Operator.

For more information, see the xref:../operators/operator-reference.adoc#cluster-cloud-controller-manager-operator_platform-operators-ref[Cluster Cloud Controller Manager Operator] entry in the _Platform Operators reference_.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-10-operator-sdk-v-1-16-0"]
==== Operator SDK v1.16.0

{product-title} 4.10 supports Operator SDK v1.16.0. See xref:../cli_reference/osdk/cli-osdk-install.adoc#cli-osdk-install[Installing the Operator SDK CLI] to install or update to this latest version.

[NOTE]
====
Operator SDK v1.16.0 supports Kubernetes 1.22.
====

Many deprecated `v1beta1` APIs were removed in Kubernetes 1.22, including `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime v0.10.0` and `controller-gen v0.7`. This is a breaking change if you need to scaffold `v1beta1` APIs for custom resource definitions (CRDs) or webhooks to publish your project into older cluster versions.

For more information about changes introduced in Kubernetes 1.22, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html/release_notes/ocp-4-9-release-notes#ocp-4-9-osdk-k8s-api-bundle-validate[Validating bundle manifests for APIs removed from Kubernetes 1.22] and link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.9/html/release_notes/ocp-4-9-release-notes#ocp-4-9-removed-kube-1-22-apis[Beta APIs removed from Kubernetes 1.22] in the {product-title} 4.9 release notes.

If you have any Operator projects that were previously created or maintained with Operator SDK v1.10.1, see xref:../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-upgrading-projects.adoc#osdk-upgrading-projects[Upgrading projects for newer Operator SDK versions] to ensure your projects are upgraded to maintain compatibility with Operator SDK v1.16.0.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-10-cluster-autoscaler-alert-change"]
==== Changed Cluster Autoscaler alert severity

Previously, the `ClusterAutoscalerUnschedulablePods` alert showed a severity of `warning`, which suggested it required developer intervention. This alert is informational and does not describe a problematic condition that requires intervention. With this release, the `ClusterAutoscalerUnschedulablePods` alert is reduced in severity from `warning` to `info`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2025230[*BZ#2025230*])

[id="ocp-4-10-deprecated-features"]
=== Deprecated features

[id="ocp-4-10-arch-deprecations"]
==== IBM POWER8, IBM z13 all models, LinuxONE Emperor, LinuxONE Rockhopper, and x86_64 v1 architectures will be deprecated

{op-system} functionality in IBM POWER8, IBM z13 all models, LinuxONE Emperor, LinuxONE Rockhopper, and AMD64 (x86_64) v1 CPU architectures will be deprecated in an upcoming release. Additional details for when support will discontinue for these architectures will be announced in a future release.

[NOTE]
====
AMD and Intel 64-bit architectures (x86-64-v2) will still be supported.
====

[id="ocp-4-10-docker-config-location-deprecation"]
==== Default Docker configuration location deprecation
Previously, `oc` commands that used a registry configuration would obtain credentials from the Docker configuration location, which was `~/.docker/config.json` by default. This has been deprecated and will be replaced by a Podman configuration location in a future version of {product-title}.

[id="ocp-4-10-empty-file-support-deprecation"]
==== Empty file and stdout support deprecation in oc registry login

Support for empty files using the `--registry-config` and `--to` flags in `oc registry login` has been deprecated. Support for `-` (standard output) has also been deprecated as an argument when using `oc registry login`. They will be removed in a future version of {product-title}.

[id="ocp-4-10-jenkins-non-sidecar-podtemplates-deprecation"]
==== Non-sidecar pod templates for Jenkins deprecation

* In {product-title} 4.10, the non-sidecar `maven` and `nodejs` pod templates for Jenkins are deprecated. These pod templates are planned for removal in a future release. Bug fixes and support are provided through the end of that future life cycle, after which no new feature enhancements are made. Instead, with this update, you can run Jenkins agents as sidecar containers. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JKNS-257[JKNS-257])

[id="ocp-4-10-third-party-monitoring-components-uis-deprecation"]
==== Third-party monitoring components user interface deprecation

For the following monitoring stack components, access to third-party web user interfaces (UIs) is deprecated and is planned to be removed in a future {product-title} release:

* Grafana
* Prometheus

As an alternative, users can navigate to the *Observe* section of the {product-title} web console to access dashboards and other UIs for platform components.

[id="ocp-4-10-persistent-storage-flexvolume-dep"]
==== Persistent storage using FlexVolume
In {product-title} 4.10, persistent storage using FlexVolume is deprecated. This feature is still fully supported, but only important bugs will be fixed. However, it may be removed in a future {product-title} release.
Out-of-tree Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver is the recommended way to write volume drivers in {product-title}. Maintainers of FlexVolume drivers should implement a CSI driver and move users of FlexVolume to CSI. Users of FlexVolume should move their workloads to CSI driver.

[id="ocp-4-10-removed-features"]
=== Removed features

{product-title} 4.10 removes the Jenkins Operator, which was a Technology Preview feature, from the *OperatorHub* page in the {product-title} web console interface. Bug fixes and support are no longer available.
+
Instead, you can continue to deploy Jenkins on {product-title} by using the templates provided by the Samples Operator. Alternatively, you can install the Jenkins Helm Chart from the Developer Catalog by using the *Helm* page in the *Developer* perspective of the web console.

[id="ocp-4-10-oc-commands-removed"]
==== OpenShift CLI (oc) commands removed

The following OpenShift CLI (`oc`) commands were removed with this release:

* `oc adm completion`
* `oc adm config`
* `oc adm options`

[id="ocp-4-10-removed-scheduler-policy"]
==== Scheduler policy removed

Support for configuring a scheduler policy has been removed with this release. Use a xref:../nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-profiles.adoc#nodes-scheduler-profiles[scheduler profile] instead to control how pods are scheduled onto nodes.

[id="ocp-4-10-removed-feature-rhel-7-support"]
==== {op-system-base} 7 support for compute machines removed

Support for running {op-system-base-full} 7 compute machines in {product-title} has been removed. If you prefer using {op-system-base} compute machines, they must run on {op-system-base} 8.

You cannot upgrade {op-system-base} 7 compute machines to {op-system-base} 8. You must deploy new {op-system-base} 8 hosts, and the old {op-system-base} 7 hosts must be removed.

[id="ocp-4-10-third-party-monitoring-component-uis-removal"]
==== Third-party monitoring component user interface access removed

With this release, you can no longer access third-party web user interfaces (UIs) for the following monitoring stack components:

* Alertmanager
* Thanos Querier
* Thanos Ruler (if user workload monitoring is enabled)

Instead, you can navigate to the *Observe* section of the {product-title} web console to access metrics, alerting, and metrics targets UIs for platform components.

[id="ocp-4-10-removed-feature-azure-mint-mode"]
==== Support for minting credentials for Microsoft Azure removed

Support for using the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) in mint mode on Microsoft Azure clusters has been removed. This change is due to the planned link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/update-your-apps-to-use-microsoft-graph-before-30-june-2022/[retirement of the Azure AD Graph API by Microsoft on 30 June 2022] and is being backported to all supported versions of {product-title} in z-stream updates.

For previously installed Azure clusters that use mint mode, the CCO attempts to update existing secrets. If a secret contains the credentials of previously minted app registration service principals, it is updated with the contents of the secret in `kube-system/azure-credentials`. This behavior is similar to passthrough mode.

[NOTE]
====
In addition to the `Contributor` role that is required by mint mode, the modified app registration service principals now require the `User Access Administrator` role that is used for passthrough mode.
====

While the Azure AD Graph API is still available, the CCO in upgraded versions of {product-title} attempts to clean up previously minted app registration service principals. Upgrading your cluster before the Azure AD Graph API is retired might avoid the need to clean up resources manually.

If the cluster is upgraded to a version of {product-title} that no longer supports mint mode after the Azure AD Graph API is retired, the CCO sets an `OrphanedCloudResource` condition on the associated `CredentialsRequest` but does not treat the error as fatal. The condition includes a message similar to `unable to clean up App Registration / Service Principal: <app_registration_name>`. Cleanup after the Azure AD Graph API is retired requires manual intervention using the Azure CLI tool or the Azure web console to remove any remaining app registration service principals.

To clean up resources manually, you must find and delete the affected resources.

. Using the Azure CLI tool, filter the app registration service principals that use the `<app_registration_name>` from an `OrphanedCloudResource` condition message by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ az ad app list --filter "displayname eq '<app_registration_name>'" --query '[].objectId'
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
[
  "038c2538-7c40-49f5-abe5-f59c59c29244"
]
----

. Delete the app registration service principal by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ az ad app delete --id 038c2538-7c40-49f5-abe5-f59c59c29244
----

[NOTE]
====
After cleaning up resources manually, the `OrphanedCloudResource` condition persists because the CCO cannot verify that the resources were cleaned up.

[id="ocp-4-10-bug-fixes"]
== Bug fixes

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-10-bare-metal-hardware-bug-fixes"]
==== Bare Metal Hardware Provisioning

* Previously, using a MAC address to configure a provisioning network interface was unsupported when switching the provisioning network from `Disabled` to `Managed`. With this update, a `provisioningMacAddresses` field is added to the `provisioning.metal3.io` CRD. Use this field to identify the provisioning network interface using its MAC address rather than its name. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2000081[*BZ#2000081*])

* Previously, Ironic failed to attach virtual media images for provisioning SuperMicro X11/X12 servers because these models expect a non-standard device string, for example `UsbCd`, for CD-based virtual media. With this update, provisioning now overrides `UsbCd` on SuperMicro machines provisioned with CD-based virtual media. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2009555[*BZ#2009555*])

* Previously, Ironic failed to attach virtual media images on SuperMicro X11/X12 servers due to overly restrictive URl validations on the BMCs of these machines. With this update, the `filename` parameter has now been removed from the URL if the virtual media image is backed by a local file. As a result, the parameter still passes if the image is backed by an object store. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2011626[*BZ#2011626*])

* Previously, the `curl` utility, used by the machine downloader image, did not support classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) with `no_proxy`. A a result, any CIDR in`noProxy` was ignored when downloading the {op-system-first} image. With this update, proxies are now removed from the environment before calling `curl` when appropriate. As a result, when downloading the machine image, any CIDR in `no_proxy` is no longer ignored. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1990556[*BZ#1990556*])

* Previously, virtual media based deployments of {product-title} have been observed to intermittently fail on iDRAC hardware types. This occurred when outstanding Lifecycle Controller jobs clashed with virtual media configuration requests. With this update, virtual media deployment failure has been fixed by purging any Lifecycle Controller job while registering iDRAC hardware prior to deployment. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1988879[*BZ#1988879*])

* Previously, users had to enter a long form of an IPv6 address in the installation configuration file, for example `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`. Ironic could not find an interface matching this IP address causing the installation to fail. With this update, the IPv6 address supplied by the user is converted to a short form address, for example, `2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334`. As a result, installation is now successful.

[id="ocp-4-10-builds-bug-fixes"]
==== Builds

* Before this update, if you created a build configuration containing an image change trigger in {product-title} 4.7.x or earlier, the image change trigger might trigger builds continuously.
+
This issue happened because, with the deprecation and removal of the `lastTriggeredImageID` field from the `BuildConfig` spec for Builds, the image change trigger controller stopped checking that field before instantiating builds. {product-title} 4.8 introduced new fields in the status that the image change trigger controller needed to check, but did not.
+
With this update, the image change trigger controller continuously checks the correct fields in the spec and status for the last triggered image ID. Now, it only triggers a build when necessary. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2004203[BZ#2004203])

* Before this update, image references in Builds needed to specify the Red Hat registry name explicitly. With this update, if an image reference does not contain the registry, the Build searches the Red Hat registries and other well-known registries to locate the image. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2011293[BZ#2011293])

[id="ocp-4-10-jenkins-bug-fixes"]
==== Jenkins

* Before this update, version 1.0.48 of the OpenShift Jenkins Sync Plugin introduced a `NullPointerException` error when Jenkins notified the plug-in of new jobs that were not associated with an OpenShift Jenkins Pipeline Build Strategy Build Config. Ultimately, this error was benign because there was no `BuildConfig` object to associate with the incoming Jenkins Job. Core Jenkins ignored the exception in our plug-in and moved on to the next listener. However, a long stack trace showed up in the Jenkins log that distracted users. With this update, the plug-in resolves the issue by making the proper checks to avoid this error and the subsequent stack trace. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2030692[BZ#2030692])

* Before this update, performance improvements in version 1.0.48 of the OpenShift Sync Jenkins plug-in incorrectly specified the labels accepted for `ConfigMap` and `ImageStream` objects intended to map into the Jenkins Kubernetes plug-in pod templates. As a result, the plug-in no longer imported pod templates from `ConfigMap` and `ImageStream` objects with a `jenkins-agent` label.
+
This update corrects the accepted label specification so that the plug-in imports pod templates from `ConfigMap` and `ImageStream` objects that have the `jenkins-agent` label. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2034839[2034839])

[id="ocp-4-10-cloud-compute-bug-fixes"]
==== Cloud Compute

* Previously, editing a machine specification on {rh-openstack-first} would cause {product-title} to attempt to delete and recreate the machine. As a result, this caused an unrecoverable loss of the node it was hosting. With this fix, any edits made to the machine specification after creation are ignored. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1962066[*BZ#1962066*])

* Previously, on clusters that run on {rh-openstack-first}, floating IP addresses were not reported for machine objects. As a result, certificate signing requests (CSRs) that the kubelet created were not accepted, preventing nodes from joining the cluster. All IP addresses are now reported for machine objects. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2022627[*BZ#2022627*])

* Previously, the check to ensure that the AWS machine was not updated before requeueing was removed. Consequently, problems arose when the AWS machine's virtual machine had been removed, but its object was still available. If this happens, the AWS machine would requeue in an infinite loop and could not be deleted or updated. This update restores the check that was used to ensure that the AWS machine was not updated before requeueing. As a result, machines no longer requeue if they have been updated. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2007802[*BZ#2007802*])

* Previously, modifying a selector changed the list of machines that a machine set observed. As a result, leaks could occur because the machine set lost track of machines it had already created. This update ensures that the selector is immutable once created. As a result, machine sets now lists the correct machines. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2005052[*BZ#2005052*])

* Previously, if a virtual machine template had snapshots, an incorrect disk size was picked due to an incorrect usage of the `linkedClone` operation. With this update, the default clone operation is changed to `fullClone` for all situations. `linkedClone` must now by specified by the user. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2001008[*BZ#2001008*])

* Previously, the custom resource definition (CRD) schema requirements did not allow numeric values. Consequently, marshaling errors occurred during upgrades. This update corrects the schema requirements to allow both string and numeric values. As a result, marshaling errors are no longer reported by the API server conversion. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1999425[*BZ#1999425*])

* Previously, if the Machine API Operator was moved, or the pods were deployed as a result of a name change, the `MachineNotYetDeleted` metric would reset for each monitored machine. This update changes the metric query to ignore the source pod label. As a result, the `MachineNotYetDeleted` metric now properly alerts in scenarios where the Machine API Operator pod has been renamed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1986237[*BZ#1986237*])

* Previously, egress IPs on vSphere were picked up by the vSphere cloud provider within the kubelet. These were unexpected by the certificate signing requests (CSR) approver. Consequently, nodes with egress IPs would not have their CSR renewals approved. This update allows the CSR approver to account for egress IPs. As a result, nodes with egress IPs on vSphere SDN clusters now continue to function and have valid CSR renewals. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1860774[*BZ#1860774*])

* Previously, worker nodes failed to start, and the installation program failed to generate URL images due to the broken path defaulting for the disk image and incompatible changes in the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) SDK. As a result, the machine controller was unable to create machines. This fix repairs the URL images by changing the base path in the GCP SDK. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2009111[*BZ#2009111*])

* Previously, the machine would freeze during the deletion process due to a lag in the vCenter's `powerOff` task. VMware showed the machine to be powered off, but {product-title} reported it to be powered on, which resulted in the machine freezing during the deletion process. This update improves the `powerOff` task handling on vSphere to be checked before the task to delete from the database is created, which prevents the machine from freezing during the deletion process. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2011668[*BZ#2011668*])

* After installing or updating {product-title}, the value of the metrics showed one pending CSR after the last CSR was reconciled. This resulted in the metrics reporting one pending CSR when there should be no pending CSRs. This fix ensures the pending CSR count is always valid post-approval by updating the metrics at the end of each reconcile loop. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2013528[*BZ#2013528*])

* Previously, AWS checked for credentials when the `cloud-provider` flag was set to empty string. The credentials were checked by making calls to the metadata service, even on non-AWS platforms. This caused latency in the ECR provider startup and AWS credential errors logged in all platforms, including non-AWS. This fix prevents the credentials check from making any requests to the metadata service to ensure that credential errors are no longer being logged. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2015515[*BZ#2015515*])

* Previously, the Machine API sometimes reconciled a machine before AWS had communicated VM creation across its API. As a result, AWS reported the VM does not exist and the Machine API considered it failed. With this release, the Machine API waits until the AWS API has synched before trying to mark the machine as provisioned. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2025767[*BZ#2025767*])

* Previously, a large volume of nodes created simultaneously on UPI clusters could lead to a large number of CSRs being generated. As a result, certificate renewals were not automated because the approver stops approving certificates when there are over 100 pending certificate requests. With this release, existing nodes are accounted for when calculating the approval cut-off and UPI clusters can now benefit from automated certificate renewal even with large scale refresh requests. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2028019[*BZ#2028019*])

* Previously, the generated list of instance types embedded in Machine API controllers was out of date. Some of these instance types were unknown and could not be annotated for scale-from-zero requirements. With this release, the generated list is updated to include support for newer instance types. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2040376[*BZ#2040376*])

* Previously, AWS Machine API controllers did not set the IOPS value for block devices other than the IO1 type, causing IOPS fields for GP3 block devices to be ignored. With this release, the IOPS is set on all supported block device types and users can set IOPS for block devices that are attached to the machine.

[id="ocp-4-10-cloud-credential-operator-bug-fixes"]
==== Cloud Credential Operator

* Previously, when using the Cloud Credential Operator in manual mode on an Azure cluster, the `Upgradeable` status was not set to `False`. This behavior was different for other platforms. With this release, Azure clusters using the Cloud Credential Operator in manual mode have the `Upgradeable` status set to `False`.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1976674[*BZ#1976674*])

* Previously, the now unnecessary `controller-manager-service` service resource that was created by the Cloud Credential Operator was still present. With this release, the Cluster Version Operator cleans it up.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1977319[*BZ#1977319*])

* Previously, changes to the log level setting for the Cloud Credential Operator in the `CredentialsRequest` custom resource were ignored. With this release, logging verbosity can be controlled by editing the `CredentialsRequest` custom resource.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1991770[*BZ#1991770*])

* Previously, the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) pod restarted with a continuous error when AWS was the default secret annotator for {rh-openstack-first}. This update fixes the default setting for the CCO pod and prevents the CCO pod from failing. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1996624[*BZ#1996624*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-10-cluster-version-operator-bug-fixes"]
==== Cluster Version Operator

* Previously, a pod might fail to start due to an invalid mount request that was not a part of the manifest. With this update, the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) removes any volumes and volume mounts from in-cluster resources that are not included in the manifest. This allows pods to start successfully. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2002834[*BZ#2002834*])

* Previously, when monitoring certificates were rotated, the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) would log errors and monitoring would be unable to query metrics until the CVO pod was manually restarted. With this update, the CVO monitors the certificate files and automatically recreates the metrics connection whenever the certificate files change.

[id="ocp-4-10-console-storage-bug-fixes"]
==== Console Storage Plug-in

* Previously, a loading prompt was not present while the persistent volumes (PVs) were being provisioned and the capacity was `0` TiB which created a confusing scenario. With this update, a loader is added for the loading state which provides details to the user if the PVs are still being provisioned or capacity is to be determined. It will also inform the user of any errors in the process. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1928285[*BZ#1928285*])

* Previously, the grammar was not correct in certain places and there were instances where translators were unable to interpret the context. This had a negative impact on readability. With this update, the grammar in various places is corrected, the storage classes for translators is itemized, and the overall readability is improved. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1961391[*BZ#1961391*])

* Previously, when pressing a pool inside the block pools page, the final `Ready` phase persisted after deletion. Consequently, the pool was in the `Ready` state even after deletion. This update redirects users to the *Pools* page and refreshes the pools after detention. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1981396[*BZ#1981396*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-10-dns-bug-fixes"]
==== Domain Name System (DNS)

* Previously, the DNS Operator did not cache responses from upstream resolvers that were configured using `spec.servers`. With this update, the DNS Operator now caches responses from all upstream servers. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2006803[*BZ#2006803*])

* Previously, the DNS Operator did not enable the `prometheus` pug-in in the server blocks for custom upstream resolvers. Consequently, CoreDNS did not report metrics for upstream resolvers and only reported metrics for the default server block. With this update, the DNS Operator was changed to enable the `prometheus` plug-in in all server blocks. CoreDNS now reports Prometheus metrics for custom upstream resolvers. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2020489[*BZ#2020489*])

* Previously, an upstream DNS that provided a response greater than 512 characters caused an application to fail. This occurred because it could not clone the repository from GitHub because to DNS could not be resolved. With this update, the `bufsize` for KNI CoreDNS is set to 521 to avoid name resolutions from GitHub. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1991067[*BZ#1991067*])

* When the DNS Operator reconciles its operands, the Operator gets the cluster DNS service object from the API to determine whether the Operator needs to create or update the service. If the service already exists, the Operator compares it with what the Operator expects to get to determine whether an update is needed. Kubernetes 1.22, on which {product-title} 4.9 is based, introduced a new `spec.internalTrafficPolicy` API field for services. The Operator leaves this field empty when it creates the service, but the API sets a default value for this field. The Operator was observing this default value and trying to update the field back to the empty value. This caused the Operator's update logic to continuously try to revert the default value that the API set for the service's internal traffic policy. With this fix, when comparing services to determine whether an update is required, the Operator now treats the empty value and default value for `spec.internalTrafficPolicy` as equal. As a result, the Operator no longer spuriously tries to update the cluster DNS service when the API sets a default value for the service's `spec.internalTrafficPolicy field`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2002461[*BZ#2002461*])

* Previously, the DNS Operator did not enable the cache plug-in for server blocks in the CoreDNS `Corefile` configuration map corresponding to entries in the `spec.servers` field of the `dnses.operator.openshift.io/default` object. As a result, CoreDNS did not cache responses from upstream resolvers that were configured using `spec.servers`. With this bug fix, the DNS Operator is changed to enable the cache plug-in for all server blocks, using the same parameters that the Operator already configured for the default server block. CoreDNS now caches responses from all upstream resolvers. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2006803[*BZ#2006803*])

[id="ocp-4-10-image-registry-bug-fixes"]
==== Image Registry

* Previously, the registry internally resolved `\docker.io` references into `\registry-1.docker.io` and used it to store credentials. As a result, credentials for `\docker.io` images could not be located. With this update, the `\registry-1.docker.io` hostname has been changed back to `\docker.io` when searching for credentials. As a result, the registry can correctly find credentials for `\docker.io images`. (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2024859[*BZ#2024859*])

* Previously, the image pruner job did not retry upon failure. As a result, a single failure could degrade the Image Registry Operator until the next time it ran. With this fix, the temporary problems with the pruner do not degrade the Image Registry Operator. (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2051692[*BZ#2051692*])

* Previously, the Image Registry Operator was modifying objects from the informer. As a result, these objects could be concurrently modified by the informer and cause race conditions. With this fix, controllers and informers have different copies of the object and do not have race conditions. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2028030[*BZ#2028030*])

* Previously, `TestAWSFinalizerDeleteS3Bucket` would fail because of an issue with the location of the configuration object in the Image Registry Operator. This update ensures that the configuration object is stored in the correct location. As a result, the Image Registry Operator no longer panics when running `TestAWSFinalizerDeleteS3Bucket`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2048443[*BZ#2048443*])

* Previously, error handling caused the `access denied` error to be output as `authentication required`. This bug resulted in incorrect error logs. Through Docker distribution error handling, the error output was changed from `authentication required` to `access denied`. Now the `access denied` error provides more precise error logs. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1902456[*BZ#1902456*])

* Previously, the registry was immediately exiting on a shut down request. As a result, the router did not have time to discover that the registry pod was gone and could send requests to it. With this fix, when the pod is deleted it stays active for a few extra seconds to give other components time to discover its deletion. Now, the router does not send requests to non-existent pods during upgrades, which no longer leads to disruptions. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1972827[*BZ#1972827*])

* Previously, the registry proxied response from the first available mirrored registry. When a mirror registry was available but did not have the requested data, pull-through did not try to use other mirrors even if they contained the required data. With this fix, pull-through tries other mirror registries if the first mirror replied with `Not Found`. Now, pull-through can discover data if it exists on any mirror registry.

[id="ocp-4-10-image-streams-bug-fixes"]
==== Image Streams

* Previously, the image policy admission plug-in did not recognize deployment configurations, notably that stateful sets could be updated. As a result, image stream references stayed unresolved in deployment configurations when the `resolve-names` annotation was used. Now, the plug-in is updated so that it resolves annotations in deployment configurations and stateful sets. As a result, image stream tags get resolved in created and edited deployment configurations. (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2000216[*BZ#2000216*])

* Previously, when global pull secrets were updated, existing API server pod pull secrets were not updated. Now, the mount point for the pull secret is changed from the `/var/lib/kubelet/config.json` file to the `/var/lib/kubelet` directory. As a result, the updated pull secret now appears in existing API server pods. (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1984592[*BZ#1984592*])

* Previously, the image admission plug-in did not check annotations inside deployment configuration templates. As a result, annotations inside deployment configuration templates could not be handled in replica controllers, and they were ignored. Now, the image admission plug-in analyzes the template of deployment configurations. With this fix, the image admission plug-in recognizes the annotations on the deployment configurations and on their templates.

[id="ocp-4-10-installer-bug-fixes"]
==== Installer

* The {product-title} Baremetal IPI installer previously used the first nodes defined under hosts in `install-config` as control plane nodes rather than filtering for the hosts with the `master` role. The role of `master` and `worker` nodes is now recognized when defined. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2003113[*BZ#2003113*])

* Before this update, it was possible to set host bits in the provisioning network CIDR. This could cause the provisioning IP to differ from what was expected leading to conflict with other IP addresses on the provisioning network. With this update, validation ensures that the provisioning network CIDR cannot contain host bits. If a provisioning Network CIDR includes host bits, the installation program stops and logs an error message. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2006291[*BZ#2006291*])

* Previously, pre-flight checks did not account for {rh-openstack-first} resource utilization. As a result, those checks failed with an incorrect error message when utilization, rather than quota, impeded installation. Pre-flight checks now process both {rh-openstack} quota and utilization. The checks fail with correct error messages if the quota is sufficient but resources are not. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2001317[*BZ#2001317*])

* Before this update, the oVirt Driver could specify ReadOnlyMany (ROX) and ReadWriteMany (RWX) access modes when creating a PVC from a configuration file. This caused an error because the driver does not support shared disks and, as a result, could not support these access modes. With this update, the access mode has been limited to single node access. The system prevents any attempt to specify ROX or RWX when creating PVC and logs an error message. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1882983[*BZ#1882983*])

* Previously, disk uploads in the Terraform provider were not handled properly. As a result, the {product-title} installation program failed. With this update, disk upload handling has been fixed, and disk uploads succeed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917893[*BZ#1917893*])

* Previously, when installing a Microsoft Azure cluster with a special size, the installation program would check if the total number of virtual CPUs (vCPU) met the minimum resource requirement to deploy the cluster. Consequently, this could cause an install error. This update changes the check the installation program makes from the total number of vCPUs to the number of vCPUs available. As a result, a concise error message is given that lets the Operator know that the virtual machine size does not meet the minimum resource requirements. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2025788[*BZ#2025788*])

* Previously, RAM validation for {rh-openstack-first} checked for values using a wrong unit, and as a result the validation accepted flavors that did not meet minimum RAM requirements. With this fix, RAM validation now rejects flavors with insufficient RAM. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2009699[*BZ#2009699*])

* Previously, {product-title} control plane nodes were missing Ingress security group rules when they were schedulable and deployed on {rh-openstack-first}. As a result, {product-title} deployments on {rh-openstack} failed for compact clusters with no dedicated workers. This fix adds Ingress security group rules on {rh-openstack-first} when control plane nodes are schedulable. Now, you can deploy compact three-node clusters on {rh-openstack}. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1955544[*BZ#1955544*])

* Previously, if you specified an invalid AWS region, the installation program continued to try and validate availability zones. This caused the installation program to become unresponsive for 60 minutes before timing out. The installation program now verifies the AWS region and service endpoints before availability zones, which reduces the amount of time the installation program takes to report the error. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2019977[*BZ#2019977*])

* Previously, you could not install a cluster to VMware vSphere if the vCenter hostname began with a number. The installation program has been updated and no longer treats this type of hostname as invalid. Now, a cluster deploys successfully when the vCenter hostname begins with a number.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2021607[*BZ#2021607*])

* Previously, if you specified a custom disk instance type when deploying a cluster on Microsoft Azure, the cluster might not deploy. This occurred because the installation program incorrectly determined that the minimum resource requirements had been met. The installation program has been updated, and now reports an error when the number of vcpus available for the instance type in the selected region does not meet the minimum resource requirements. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2025788[*BZ#2025788*])

* Previously, if you defined custom IAM roles when deploying an AWS cluster, you might have to manually remove bootstrap instance profiles after uninstalling the cluster. Intermittently, the installation program did not remove bootstrap instance profiles. The installation program has been updated, and all machine instance profiles are removed when the cluster is uninstalled.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2028695[*BZ#2028695*])

* Previously, the default provisioningIP value was different when the host bits were set in the provisioning network CIDR. This resulted in a different value for the provisioningIP than expected. This difference caused a conflict with the other IP addresses on the provisioning network. This fix adds a validation to ensure that the ProvisioningNetworkCIDR does not have host bits set. As a result, if the ProvisioningNetworkCIDR has the host bits set, the installation program will stop and report the validation error. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2006291[*BZ#2006291*])

* Previously, the BMC driver IPMI was not supported for a secure UEFI boot. This resulted in an unsuccessful boot. This fix adds a validation check to ensure that `UEFISecureBoot` mode is not used with bare-metal drivers. As a result, a secure UEFI boot is successful. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2011893[*BZ#2011893*])

* With this update, the 4.8 UPI template is updated from version 3.1.0 to 3.2.0 to match the Ignition version. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1949672[*BZ#1949672*])

* Previously, when asked to mirror the contents of the base registry, the {product-title} installation program would exit with a validation error, citing incorrect `install-config` file values for `imageContentSources`. With this update, the installation program now allows `imageContentSources` values to specify base registry names and the installation program no longer exits when specifying a base registry name. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1960378[*BZ#1960378*])

* Previously, the UPI ARM templates were attaching an SSH key to the virtual machine (VM) instances created. As a result, the creation of the VMs fails when the SSH key provided by the user is the `ed25519` type. With this update, the creation of the VMs succeeds regardless of the type of the SSH key provided by the user. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1968364[*BZ#1968364*])

* After successfully creating a `aws_vpc_dhcp_options_association` resource, AWS might still report that the resource does not exist. Consequently, the AWS Terraform provider fails the installation. With this update, you can retry the query of the `aws_vpc_dhcp_options_association` resource for a period of time after creation until AWS reports that the resource exists. As a result, installations succeed despite AWS reporting that the `aws_vpc_dhcp_options_association` resource does not exist. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2032521[*BZ#2032521*])

* Previously, when installing {product-title} on AWS with local zones enabled, the installation program could create some resources on a local zone rather than an availability zone. This caused the installation program to fail because load balancers cannot run on local zones. With this fix, the installation program ignores local zones and only considers availability zones when installing cluster components. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1997059[*BZ#1997059*])

* Previously, terraform could attempt to upload the bootstrap ignition configuration file to Azure before it had finished creating the configuration file. If the upload started before the local file was created, the installation would fail. With this fix, terraform uploads the ignition configuration file directly to Azure rather than creating a local copy first. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2004313[*BZ#2004313*])

* Previously, a race condition could occur if the `cluster-bootstrap` and Cluster Version Operator components attempted to write a manifest for the same resource to the Kubernetes API at the same time. This could result in the `Authentication` resource being overwritten by a default copy, which removed any customizations made to that resource. With this fix, the Cluster Version Operator has been blocked from overwriting the manifests that come from the installation program. This prevents any user-specified customizations to the `Authentication` resource from being overwritten. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2008119[*BZ#2008119*])

* Previously, when installing {product-title} on AWS, the installation program created the bootstrap machine using the `m5.large` instance type. This caused the installation to fail in regions where that instance type is not available. With this fix, the bootstrap machine uses the same instance type as the control plane machines. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2016955[*BZ#2016955*])

* Previously, when installing {product-title} on AWS, the installation program did not recognize EC2 G and Intel Virtualization Technology (VT) instances and defaulted them to X instances. This caused incorrect instance quotas to be applied to these instances. With this fix, the installation program recognizes EC2 G and VT instances and applies the correct instance quotas.

==== Kubernetes Scheduler

* Before this update, upgrading to the current release did not set the correct weights for the `TaintandToleration`, `NodeAffinity`, and `InterPodAffinity` parameters. This update resolves the issue so that upgrading correctly sets the weights for `TaintandToleration` to `3`, `NodeAffinity` to `2`, and `InterPodAffinity` to `2`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2039414[*BZ#2039414*])

* In {product-title} 4.10, code for serving insecure metrics is removed from the `kube-scheduler` code base. Now, metrics are served only through a secure server. Bug fixes and support are provided through the end of a future life cycle. After which, no new feature enhancements are made. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1889488[*BZ#1889488*])

[id="ocp-4-10-machine-config-operator-bug-fixes"]
==== Machine Config Operator

* Previously, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) stored pending configuration changes to the disk before operating system (OS) changes were applied. As a result, in situations such as power loss, the MCO assumed OS changes had already been applied on restart, and validation skipped over changes such as `kargs` and `kernel-rt`. With this update,  configuration changes to disk are stored after OS changes are applied. Now, if power is lost during the configuration application, the MCO knows it must reattempt the configuration application on restart. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1916169[*BZ#1916169*])

* Previously, an old version of the Kubernetes client library in the `baremetal-runtimecfg` project prevented the timely closing of client connections following a VIP failover. This could result in long delays for monitor containers that rely on the API. This update allows the timely closing of client connections following a VIP failover. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1995021[*BZ#1995021*])

* Previously, when updating SSH keys, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) changed the owner and group of the `authorized_keys` file to `root`. This update ensures that the MCO preserves `core` as the owner and group when it updates the `authorized_keys` file. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1956739[BZ#1956739])

* Previously, a warning message sent by the `clone_slave_connection` function was incorrectly stored in a `new_uuid` variable, which is intended to store only the connection's UUID. As a result, `nmcli` commands that include the `new_uuid` variable were failing due to the incorrect value being stored in the `new_uuid` variable. With this fix, the `clone_slave_connection` function warning message is redirected to `stderr`. Now, `nmcli` commands that reference the `new_uuid` variable do not fail. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2022646[*BZ#2022646*])

* Previously, an old version of the Kubernetes client library was present in the `baremetal-runtimecfg` project. When a Virtual IP (VIP) failed, the client connections might not be closed in a timely manner. This could result in long delays for monitor containers that rely on talking to the API. This fix updates the client library. Now, connections are closed as expected on VIP failovers and the monitor containers do not hang for an excessive period of time. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1995021[*BZ#1995021*])

* Before this update, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) stored pending configuration changes to disk before it applied them to {op-system-first}. If a power loss interrupted the MCO from applying the configuration, it treated the configuration as applied and did not validate the changes. If this configuration contained invalid changes, applying them failed. With this update, the MCO saves a configuration to disk only after being applied. This way, if the power is lost while the MCO is applying the configuration, it reapplies the configuration after it restarts. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1916169[*BZ#1916169*])

* Before this update, when you used the Machine Config Operator (MCO) to create or update an SSH key, it set the owner and group of the `authorized_keys` file to `root`. This update resolves the issue. When the MCO creates or updates the `authorized_keys` file, it correctly sets or preserves `core` as the owner and group of the file. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1956739[*BZ#1956739*])

* Previously, in clusters that use Stateless Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC), the Ironic `addr-gen-mode` parameter was not being persisted to the OVNKubernetes bridge. As a result, the IPv6 addresses could change when the bridge was created. This broke the cluster because node IP changes are unsupported. This fix persists the `addr-gen-mode` parameter when creating the bridge. The IP address is now consistent throughout the deployment process. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1990625[*BZ#1990625*])

* Previously, if a machine config included a compressed file with the `spec.config.storage.files.contents.compression` parameter set to `gzip`, the Machine Config Daemon (MCD) incorrectly wrote the compressed file to disk without extracting it. With this fix, the MCD now extracts a compressed file when the compression parameter is set to `gzip`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1970218[*BZ#1970218*])

* Previously, `systemd` units were cleaned up only when completely removed. As a result, `systemd` units could not be unmasked by using a machine config because the masks were not being removed unless the `systemd` unit was completely removed. With this fix, when you configure a `systemd` unit as `mask: true` in a machine config, any existing masks are removed. As a result, `systemd` units can now be unmasked.

==== Management Console

* Previously, the *OperatorHub* category and card links did not include valid `href` attributes. Consequently, the *OperatorHub* category and card links could not be opened in a new tab. This update adds valid `href` attributes to the *OperatorHub* category and card links. As a result, the *OperatorHub* and its card links can be opened in new tabs. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2013127[*BZ#2013127*])

* Previously, on the *Operand Details* page, a special case was created where the conditions table for the `status.conditions` property always rendered before all other tables. Consequently, the `status.conditions` table did not follow the ordering rules of descriptors, which caused unexpected behavior when users tried to change the order of the tables. This update removes the special case for `status.conditions` and only defaults to rendering it first if no descriptor is defined for that property. As a result, the table for `status.condition` is rendered according to descriptor ordering rules when a descriptor is defined on that property. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2014488[*BZ#2014488*])

* Previously, the *Resource Details* page metrics tab was exceeding the cluster-scoped Thanos endpoint. Consequently, users without authorization for this endpoint would receive a `401` response for all queries. With this update, the Thanos tenancy endpoints are updated, and redundant namespace query arguments are removed. As a result, users with the correct role-based access control (RBAC) permissions can now see data in the metrics tab of the *Resource Details* page. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2015806[*BZ#2015806*])

* Previously, when an Operator added an API to an existing API group, it did not trigger API discovery. Consequently, new APIs were not seen by the front end until the page was refreshed. This update makes APIs added by Operators viewable by the front end without a page refresh. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1815189[*BZ#1815189*])

* Previously, in the {console-redhat-com} for {rh-openstack-first}, the control plane was not translated into simplified Chinese. As a result, naming differed from {product-title} documentation. This update fixes the translation issue in the {console-redhat-com}. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1982063[*BZ#1982063*])

[id="ocp-4-10-monitoring-bug-fixes"]
==== Monitoring

* Previously, during {product-title} upgrades, the Prometheus service could become unavailable because either two Prometheus pods were located on the same node or the two nodes running the pods rebooted during the same interval.
This situation was possible because the Prometheus pods had soft anti-affinity rules regarding node placement and no `PodDisruptionBudget` resources provisioned.
Consequently, metrics were not collected and rules were not evaluated over a period of time.
+
To fix this issue, the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) now configures hard anti-affinity rules to ensure that the two Prometheus pods are scheduled on different nodes.
The CMO also provisions `PodDisruptionBudget` resources to ensure that at least one Prometheus pod is always running.
As a result, during upgrades, the nodes now reboot in sequence to ensure that at least one Prometheus pod is always running. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1933847[*BZ#1933847*])

* Previously, the Thanos Ruler service would become unavailable when the node that contains the two Thanos Ruler pods experienced an outage.
This situation occurred because the Thanos Ruler pods had only soft anti-affinity rules regarding node placement.
Consequently, user-defined rules would not be evaluated until the node came back online.
+
With this release, the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) now configures hard anti-affinity rules to ensure that the two Thanos Ruler pods are scheduled on different nodes.
As a result, a single-node outage no longer creates a gap in user-defined rule evaluation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1955490[*BZ#1955490*])

* Previously, the Prometheus service would become unavailable when the two Prometheus pods were located on the same node and that node experienced an outage.
This situation occurred because the Prometheus pods had only soft anti-affinity rules regarding node placement.
Consequently, metrics would not be collected, and rules would not be evaluated until the node came back online.
+
With this release, the Cluster Monitoring Operator configures hard anti-affinity rules to ensure that the two Prometheus pods are scheduled on different nodes.
As a result, Prometheus pods are now scheduled on different nodes, and a single node outage no longer creates a gap in monitoring.(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1949262[*BZ#1949262*])

* Previously, during {product-title} patch upgrades, the Alertmanager service might become unavailable because either the three Alertmanager pods were located on the same node or the nodes running the Alertmanager pods happened to reboot at the same time.
This situation was possible because the Alertmanager pods had soft anti-affinity rules regarding node placement and no `PodDisruptionBudget` provisioned.
This release enables hard anti-affinity rules and `PodDisruptionBudget` resources to ensure no downtime during patch upgrades for the Alertmanager and other monitoring components. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1955489[*BZ#1955489*])

* Previously, a false positive `NodeFilesystemSpaceFillingUp` alert was triggered when the file system space was occupied by many Docker images.
For this release, the threshold to fire the `NodeFilesystemSpaceFillingUp` warning alert is now reduced to 20% space available, rather than 40%, which stops the false positive alert from firing. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1987263[*BZ#1987263*])

* Previously, alerts for the Prometheus Operator component did not apply to the Prometheus Operator that runs the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace when user-defined monitoring is enabled.
Consequently, no alerts fired when the Prometheus Operator that manages the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace encountered issues.
+
With this release, alerts have been modified to monitor both the `openshift-monitoring` and `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespaces.
As a result, cluster administrators receive alert notifications when the Prometheus Operator that manages user-defined monitoring encounters issues. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2001566[*BZ#2001566*])

* Previously, if the number of DaemonSet pods for the `node-exporter` agent was not equal to the number of nodes in the cluster, the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) would report a condition of `degraded`. This issue would occur when one of the nodes was not in the `ready` condition.
+
This release now verifies that the number of DaemonSet pods for the `node-exporter` agent is not less than the number of ready nodes in the cluster. This process ensures that a `node-exporter` pod is running on every active node.
As a result, the CMO will not report a degraded condition if one of the nodes is not in a ready state. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2004051[*BZ#2004051*])

* This release fixes an issue in which some pods in the monitoring stack would start before TLS certificate-related resources were present, which resulted in failures and restarts. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2016352[*BZ#2016352*])

* Previously, if reporting metrics failed due to reaching the configured sample limit, the metrics target would still appear with a status of `Up` in the web console UI even though the metrics were missing. With this release, Prometheus bypasses the sample limit setting for reporting metrics, and the metrics now appear regardless of the sample limit setting.

[id="ocp-4-10-networking-bug-fixes"]
==== Networking

* When using the OVN-Kubernetes network provider in {product-title} versions prior to 4.8, the node routing table was used for routing decisions. In newer versions of {product-title}, the host routing table is bypassed. In this release, you can now specify whether you want to use or bypass the host kernel networking stack for traffic routing decisions. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1996108[*BZ#1996108*])

* Previously, when Kuryr was used in a restricted installation with proxy, the Cluster Network Operator was not enforcing usage of the proxy to allow communication with the {rh-openstack-first} API. Consequently, cluster installation did not progress. With this update, the Cluster Network Operator can communicate with the {rh-openstack} API through the proxy. As a result, installation now succeeds. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1985486[*BZ#1985486*])

* Before this update, the SRIOV webhook blocked the creation of network policies on {product-title} on {rh-openstack-first} environments. With this update, the SRIOV webhook reads and validates the {rh-openstack} metadata and can now be used to create network policies. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2016334[*BZ#2016334*])

* Previously, the `MachineConfig` object could not be updated because the SRIOV Operator did not pause the `MachineConfig` pool object. With this update, the SRIOV Operator pauses the relevant machine config pool before running any configuration requiring reboot. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2021151[*BZ#2021151*])

* Previously, there were timing issues with `keepalived` that resulted in its termination when it should have been running. This update prevents multiple `keepalived` commands from being sent in a short period of time. As a result, timing issues are no longer a problem and `keepalive` continuously runs. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2022050[*BZ#2022050*])

* Previously, when Kuryr was used in a restricted installation with proxy, the Cluster Networking Operator was not enforcing usage of the proxy to allow communication with the {rh-openstack-first} API.

As a result, installation now succeeds. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1985486[*BZ#1985486*])

* Previously, pods that used secondary interfaces with IP addresses provided by the Whereabouts Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-in might get stuck in the `ContainerCreating` state because of IP address exhaustion. Now, Whereabouts properly accounts for released IP addresses from cluster events, such as reboots, that previously were not tracked. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1914053[BZ#1914053])

* Previously, when using the OpenShift SDN cluster network provider, idled services used an increasing amount of CPU to un-idle services. In this release, the idling code for kube-proxy is optimized to reduce CPU utilizing for service idling. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1966521[*BZ#1966521*])

* Previously, when using the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network provider, the presence of any unknown field in an internal configuration map could cause the OVN-Kubernetes pods to fail to start during a cluster upgrade. Now the presence of unknown fields causes a warning, rather than a failure. As a result, the OVN-Kubernetes pods now successfully start during a cluster upgrade. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1988440[*BZ#1988440*])

* Previously, a webhook for the SR-IOV Network Operator blocked network policies for OpenShift installations on OpenStack.
Users were not able to create SR-IOV network policies.
This update fixes the webhook.
Users can now create SR-IOV network policies for installations on OpenStack.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2016334[*BZ#2016334*])

* Previously, the CRI-O runtime engine passed pod UIDs by using the `K8S_POD_UID` variable.
But when pods were deleted and recreated at the same time that Multus was setting up networking for the deleted pod's sandbox, this method resulted in additional metadata and unnecessary processing.
In this update, Multus handles pod UIDs, and unnecessary metadata processing is avoided.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2017882[*BZ#2017882*])

* Previously, in deployments of OpenShift on a single node, default settings for the SR-IOV Network Operator prevented users from making certain modifications to nodes.
By default, after configuration changes are applied, affected nodes are drained and then restarted with the new configuration.
This behavior does not work when there is only one node.
In this update, when you install the SR-IOV Network Operator in a single-node deployment, the Operator changes its configuration so the `.spec.disableDrain` field is set to `true`.
Users can now apply configuration changes successfully in single-node deployments.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2021151[*BZ#2021151*])

* Client-go versions 1.20 and earlier did not have sufficient technique for retrying requests to the Kubernetes API.
As a result, retries to the Kubernetes API were not sufficient.

* Previously, network, IPC, and UTS namespace resources managed by CRI-O were only freed when the Kubelet removed stopped pods. With this  update, the Kubelet frees these resources when the pods are stopped. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2003193[*BZ#2003193*])

* Previously, when logging into a worker node, messages might appear indicating a `systemd-coredump` services failure. This was due to the unnecessary inclusion of the `system-systemd` namespace for containers. A filter now prevents this namespace from impacting the workflow. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1978528[*BZ#1978528*])

* Previously, when clusters were restarted, the status of terminated pods might have been reset to `Running`, which would result in an error. This has been corrected and now all terminated pods remain terminated and active pods reflect their correct status. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1997478[*BZ#1997478*])

* Previously, certain stop signals were ignored in {product-title}, causing services in the container to continue running. With an update to the signal parsing library, all stop signals are now respected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2000877[*BZ#2000877*])

* Previously, pod namespaces managed by CRI-O, for example network, IPC, and UTS, were not unmounted when the pod was removed. This resulted in leakage, driving the Open vSwitch CPU to 100%, which caused pod latency and other performance impacts. This has been resolved and pod namespaces are unmounted when removed.

[id="ocp-4-10-openshift-cli-bug-fixes"]
==== OpenShift CLI (oc)

* Previously, due to the increasing number of custom resource definitions (CRD) installed in the cluster, the requests reaching for API discovery were limited by client code restrictions. Now, both the limit number and QPS have been boosted, and client-side throttling should appear less frequently. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2042059[*BZ#2042059*])

* Previously, some minor requests did not have the user agent string set correctly, so the default Go user agent string was used instead for `oc`. The user agent string is now set correctly for all mirror requests, and the expected `oc` user agent string is now sent to registries. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1987257[*BZ#1987257*])

* Previously, `oc debug` assumed that it was always targeting Linux-based containers by trying to run a Bash shell, and if Bash was not present in the container, it attempted to debug as a Windows container. The `oc debug` command now uses pod selectors to determine the operating system of the containers and now works properly on both Linux and Windows-based containers. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1990014[*BZ#1990014*])

* Previously, the `--dry-run` flag was not working properly for several `oc set` subcommands, so `--dry-run=server` was performing updates to resources rather than performing a dry run. The `--dry-run` flags are now working properly to perform dry runs on the `oc set` subcommands. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2035393[*BZ#2035393*])

[id="ocp-4-10-olm-bug-fixes"]
==== Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

* Before this update, default catalog sources for the `marketplace-operator` did not tolerate tainted nodes and the `CatalogSource` pod would only have the default settings for tolerations, `nodeSelector`, and `priorityClassName`. With this update, the `CatalogSource` specification now includes the optional `spec.grpcPodConfig` field that can override tolerations, `nodeSelector`, and `priorityClassName` for the pod. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1927478[*BZ#1927478*])

* Before this update, the `csv_suceeded` metric would be lost when the OLM Operator was restarted. With this update, the `csv_succeeded` metric is emitted at the beginning of the OLM Operator's startup logic. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1927478[*BZ#1927478*])

* Before this update, the `oc adm catalog mirror` command did not set minimum and maximum values for the `--max-icsp-size` flag. As a result, the field accepted values that were less than zero or were too large. With this update, values are limited to sizes greater than zero and less than 250001. Values outside of this range fail validation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1972962[*BZ#1972962*])

* Before this update, bundled images did not contain the related images needed for Operator deployment in file-based catalogs. As a result, images were not mirrored to disconnected clusters unless specified in the `relatedImages` field of the ClusterServiceVersion (CSV). With this update, the `opm render` command adds the CSV Operator images to the `relatedImages` file when the file-based catalog bundle image is rendered. The images necessary for Operator deployment are now mirrored to disconnected clusters even if they are not listed in the `relatedImages` field of the CSV. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2002075[*BZ#2002075*])

* Before this update, it could take up to 15 minutes for Operators to perform `skipRange` updates. This was a known issue that could be resolved if cluster administrators deleted the `catalog-operator` pod in the `openshift-operator-lifecycle-manager` namespace. This caused the pod to be automatically recreated and triggered the `skipRange` upgrade. With this update, obsolete API calls have been fixed in Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), and `skipRange` updates trigger immediately. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2002276[*BZ#2002276*])

* Occasionally, update events on clusters would happen at the same time that Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) modified an object from the lister cache. This caused concurrent map writes. This fix updates OLM so it no longer modifies objects retrieved from the lister cache. Instead, OLM modifies a copy of the object where applicable. As a result, OLM no longer experiences concurrent map writes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2003164[*BZ#2003164*])

* Previously, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) could not establish gRPC connections to catalog source pods that were only reachable through a proxy. If a catalog source pod was behind a proxy, OLM could not connect to the proxy and the hosted Operator content was unavailable for installation. This bug fix introduces a `GRPC_PROXY` environment variable that defines a proxy that OLM uses to establish connections to gRPC catalog sources. As a result, OLM can now be configured to use a proxy when connecting to gRPC catalog sources. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2011927[*BZ#2011927*])

* Previously, skipped bundles were not verified to be members of the same package. Bundles could skip across packages, which broke upgrade chains. This bug fix adds validation to ensure skipped bundles are in the same package. As a result, no bundle can skip bundles in another package, and upgrade graphs no longer break across packages. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2017327[*BZ#2017327*])

* In the `CatalogSource` object, the `RegistryServiceStatus` field stores service information that is used to generate an address that Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) relies on to establish a connection with the associated pod. If the `RegistryServiceStatus` field is not nil and is missing the namespace, name, and port information for its service, OLM is unable to recover until the associated pod has an invalid image or spec. With this bug fix, when reconciling a catalog source, OLM now ensures that the `RegistryServiceStatus` field of the `CatalogSource` object is valid and updates its status to reflect the change. Additionally, this address is stored within the status of the catalog source in the `status.GRPCConnectionState.Address` field. If the address changes, OLM updates this field to reflect the new address. As a result, the `.status.connectionState.address` field of a catalog source should no longer be nil. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2026343[*BZ#2026343*])

==== {op-system-first}

* Previously, when the {op-system} live ISO added a UEFI boot entry for itself, it assumed the existing UEFI boot entry IDs were consecutive, thereby causing the live ISO to fail in the UEFI firmware when booting on systems with non-consecutive boot entry IDS. With this fix, the {op-system} live ISO no longer adds a UEFI boot entry for itself and the ISO boots successfully. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2006690[*BZ#2006690*])

* To help you determine whether a user-provided image was already booted, information has been added on the terminal console describing when the machine was provisioned through Ignition and whether a user Ignition configuration was provided. This allows you to verify that Ignition ran when you expected it to. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2016004[*BZ#2016004*])

* Previously, when reusing an existing statically keyed LUKS volume during provisioning, the encryption key was not correctly written to disk and Ignition would fail with a "missing persisted keyfile" error. With this fix, Ignition now correctly writes keys for reused LUKS volumes so that existing statically keyed LUKS volumes can be reused during provisioning. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2043296[*BZ#2043296*])

* Previously, `ostree-finalize-staged.service` failed while upgrading a {op-system-first} node to 4.6.17. To fix this, the sysroot code now ignores any irregular or non-symlink files in `/etc`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1945274[*BZ#1945274*])

* Previously, `initramfs` files were missing udev rules for by-id symlinks of attached SCSI devices. Because of this, Ignition configuration files that referenced these symlinks would result in a failed boot of the installed system. With this update, the `63-scsi-sg3_symlink.rules` for SCSI rules are added in dracut. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1990506[*BZ#1990506*])

* Previously, on bare-metal machines, a race condition occurred between `system-rfkill.service` and `ostree-remount.service`. Consequently, the `ostree-remount` service failed and the node operating system froze during the boot process. With this update, the `/sysroot/` directory is now read-only. As a result, the issue no longer occurs. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1992618[*BZ#1992618*])

* Previously, {op-system-first} live ISO boots added a UEFI boot entry, prompting a reboot on systems with a TPM. With this update, the {op-system} live ISO no longer adds a UEFI boot entry so the ISO does not initiate a reboot after first boot.

[id="ocp-4-10-performance-addon-operator-bug-fixes"]
==== Performance Addon Operator

* The spec.cpu.reserved` flag might not be correctly set by default if `spec.cpu.isolated` is the only parameter defined in `PerformanceProfile`. You must set the settings for both `spec.cpu.reserved` and `spec.cpu.isolated` in the `PerformanceProfile`. The sets must not overlap and the sum of all CPUs mentioned must cover all CPUs expected by the workers in the target pool. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1986681[*BZ#1986681*])

* Previously, the `oc adm must-gather` tool failed to collect node data if the `gather-sysinfo` binary was missing in the image. This was caused by a missing `COPY` statement in the Dockerfile. To avoid this issue, you must add the necessary `COPY` statements to the Dockerfile to generate and copy the binaries.  (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2021036[*BZ#2021036*])

* Previously, the Performance Addon Operator downloaded its image from the registry without checking whether it was available on the CRI-O cache. Consequently, the Performance Addon Operator failed to start if it could not reach the registry, or if the download timed out. With this update, the Operator only downloads its image from the registry if it cannot pull the image from the CRI-O cache. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2021202[*BZ#2021202*])

* When upgrading {product-title} to version 4.10, any comment (`#comment`) in the tuned profile that does not start at the beginning of the line causes a parsing error. Performance Addon Operator issues can be solved by upgrading it to the same level (4.10) as {product-title}. Comment-related errors can be worked around by putting all comments on a single line, with the # character at the start of the line. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2059934[*BZ#2059934*])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-10-routing-bug-fixes"]
==== Routing

* Previously, if the cluster administrator provided a default ingress certificate that was missing the newline character for the last line, the {product-title} router would write out a corrupt PEM file for HAProxy. Now, it writes out a valid PEM file even if the input is missing a newline character. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1894431[*BZ#1894431*])

* Previously, a route created where the combined name and namespace for the DNS segment was greater than 63 characters long would be rejected. This expected behavior could cause problems integrating with upgraded versions of {product-title}. Now, an annotation allows non-conformant DNS hostnames. With `AllowNonDNSCompliantHostAnnotation` set to `true`, the non-conformant DNS hostname, or one longer than 63 characters, is allowed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1964112[*BZ#1964112*])

* Previously, the Cluster Ingress Operator would not create wildcard DNS records for Ingress Controllers when the cluster's `ControlPlaneTopology` was set to `External`. In Hypershift clusters where the `ControlPlaneTopology` was set to `External` and the Platform was AWS, the Cluster Ingress Operator never became available. This updates limits the disabling of DNS updates when the `ControlPlaneTopology` is `External` and the platform is IBM Cloud. As a result, wildcard DNS entries are created for Hypershift clusters running on AWS. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2011972[*BZ#2011972*])

* Previously, the cluster ingress router was blocked from working because the Ingress Operator failed to configure a wildcard DNS record for the cluster ingress router on Azure Stack Hub IPI. With this fix, the Ingress Operator now uses the configured ARM endpoint to configure DNS on Azure Stack Hub IPI. As a result, the cluster ingress router now works properly. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2032566[*BZ#2032566*])

* Previously, the cluster-wide prox configuration could not accept IPv6 addresses for the `noProxy` setting. Consequently, it was impossible to install a cluster whose configuration was having `noProxy` with IPv6 addresses. With this update, the Cluster Network Operator is now able to parse IPv6 addresses for the `noProxy` setting of the cluster-wide proxy resource. As a result, it is now possible to exclude IPv6 addresses for the `noProxy` setting. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1939435[*BZ#1939435*])

* Before {product-title} 4.8, the IngressController API did not have any subfields under the `status.endpointPublishingStrategy.hostNetwork` and `status.endpointPublishingStrategy.nodePort` fields. These fields could be null even if the `spec.endpointPublishingStrategy.type` was set to `HostNetwork` or `NodePortService`. In {product-title} 4.8, the `status.endpointPublishingStrategy.hostNetwork.protocol` and `status.endpointPublishingStrategy.nodePort.protocol` subfields were added, and the Ingress Operator set default values for these subfields when the Operator admitted or re-admitted an IngressController that specified the "HostNetwork" or "NodePortService" strategy type. With this bug, however, the Operator ignored updates to these spec fields, and updating `spec.endpointPublishingStrategy.hostNetwork.protocol` or `spec.endpointPublishingStrategy.nodePort.protocol` to `PROXY` to enable proxy protocol on an existing IngressController had no effect. To work around this issue, it was necessary to delete and recreate the IngressController to enable PROXY protocol. With this update, the Ingress Operator is changed so that it correctly updates the status fields when `status.endpointPublishingStrategy.hostNetwork` and `status.endpointPublishingStrategy.nodePort` are null and when the IngressController spec fields specify proxy protocol with the `HostNetwork` or `NodePortService` endpoint publishing strategy type. As a result, setting `spec.endpointPublishingStrategy.hostNetwork.protocol` or `spec.endpointPublishingStrategy.nodePort.protocol` to `PROXY` now takes proper effect on upgraded clusters.

[id="ocp-4-10-samples-bug-fixes"]
==== Samples

* Before this update, if the Cluster Samples Operator encountered an `APIServerConflictError` error, it reported `sample-operator` as having `Degraded status` until it recovered. Momentary errors of this type were not unusual during upgrades but caused undue concern for administrators monitoring the Operator status. With this update, if the Operator encounters a momentary error, it no longer indicates `openshift-samples` as having `Degraded status` and tries again to connect to the API server. Momentary shifts to `Degraded status` no longer occur. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1993840[BZ#1993840])

* Before this update, various allowed and blocked registry configuration options in the cluster image configuration might prevent the Cluster Samples Operator from creating image streams. As a result, the samples operator might mark itself as degraded, which impacted the general {product-title} install and upgrade status.
+
In various circumstances, the management state of the Cluster Samples Operator can make the transition to `Removed`. With this update, these circumstances now include when the image controller configuration parameters prevent the creation of image streams by using either the default image registry or the image registry specified by the `samplesRegistry` setting. The Operator status now also indicates that the cluster image configuration is preventing the creation of the sample image streams. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2002368[BZ#2002368])

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-10-storage-bug-fixes"]
==== Storage

* Previously, the Local Storage Operator (LSO) took a long time to delete orphaned persistent volumes (PVs) due to the accumulation of a 10-second delay. With this update, the LSO does not use the 10-second delay, PVs are deleted promptly, and local disks are made available for new persistent volume claims sooner. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2001605[*BZ#2001605*])

* Previously, Manila error handling would degrade the Manila Operator, and the cluster. Errors are now treated as non-fatal so that the Manila Operator is disabled, rather than degrading the cluster. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2001620[*BZ#2001620*])

* In slower cloud environments, such as when using Cinder, the cluster might become degraded. Now, {product-title} accommodates slower environments so that the cluster does not become degraded. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2027685[*BZ#2027685*])

[discrete]
[ids="ocp-4-10-telco-edge-bug-fixes"]
==== Telco Edge

* If a generated policy has a complianceType of `mustonlyhave`, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) updates to metadata are then reverted as the policy engine restores the ‘expected’ state of the CR. Consequently, OLM and the policy engine continuously overwrite the metadata of the CR under conflict. This results in high CPU usage. With this update, OLM and the policy engine no longer conflict, which reduces CPU usage. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2009233[*BZ#2009233*])

* Previously, user-supplied fields in the `PolicyGenTemplate` overlay were not copied to generated manifests if the field did not exist in the base source CR. As a result, some user content was lost. The `policyGen` tool is now updated to support all user supplied fields. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2028881[*BZ#2028881*])

* Previously, DNS lookup failures might cause the Cluster Baremetal Operator to continually fail when installed on unsupported platforms. With this update, the Operator remains disabled when installed on an unsupported platform. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2025458[*BZ#2025458*])

==== Web console (Administrator perspective)

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-10-web-console-developer-perspective-bug-fixes"]
==== Web console (Developer perspective)

* Before this update, resources in the *Developer* perspective of the web console had invalid links to details about that resource. This update resolves the issue. It creates valid links so that users can access resource details. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2000651[BZ#2000651])

* Before this update, you could only specify a subject in the `SinkBinding` form by label, not by name. With this update, you can use a drop-down list to select whether to specify a subject by name or label. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2002266[BZ#2002266])

* Before this update, the web terminal icon was available in the web console's banner head only if you installed the Web Terminal Operator in the `openShift-operators` namespace. With this update, the terminal icon is available regardless of the namespace where you install the Web Terminal Operator. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2006329[2006329])

* Before this update, the service binding connector did not appear in topology if you used a `resource` property rather than a `kind` property to define a `ServiceBinding` custom resource (CR). This update resolves the issue by reading the CR's `resource` property to display the connector on the topology. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2013545[BZ#2013545])

* Before this update, the name input fields used a complex and recursive regular expression to validate user inputs. This regular expression made name detection very slow and often caused errors. This update resolves the issue by optimizing the regular expression and avoiding recursive matching. Now, name detection is fast and does not cause errors. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2014497[BZ#2014497])

* Before this update, feature flag gating was missing from some extensions contributed by the knative plug-in. Although this issue did not affect what was displayed, these extensions ran unnecessarily, even if the serverless operator was not installed. This update resolves the issue by adding feature flag gating to the extensions where it was missing. Now, the extensions do not run unnecessarily. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2016438[BZ#2016438])

* Before this update, if you repeatedly clicked links to get details for resources such as custom resource definitions or pods and the application encountered multiple code reference errors, it failed and displayed a `t is not a function` error. This update resolves the issue. When an error occurs, the application resolves a code reference and stores the resolution state so that it can correctly handle additional errors. The application no longer fails when code reference errors occur. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2017130[BZ#2017130])

* Before this update, users with restricted access could not access their config map in a shared namespace to save their user settings on a cluster and load them in another browser or machine. As a result, user preferences such as pinned navigation items were only saved in the local browser storage and not shared between multiple browsers. This update resolves the issue: The web console Operator automatically creates RBAC rules so that each user can save these settings to a config map in a shared namespace and more easily switch between browsers. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2018234[BZ#2018234])

* Before this update, trying to create connections between virtual machines (VMs) in the *Topology* view failed with an "Error creating connection" message. This issue happened because this action relied on a method that did not support custom resource definition (CRDs). This update resolves the issue by adding support for CRDs. Now you can create connections between VMs. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2020904[BZ#2020904])

* Before this update, the tooltip for tasks in the *PipelineRun details* showed misleading information. It showed the time elapsed since the task ran, not how long they ran. For example, it showed 122 hours for a task that ran for a couple of seconds 5 days ago. With this update, the tooltip shows the duration of the task. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2011368[BZ#2011368])

== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.8 and beyond! This needs some SME/QE review before being updated for 4.9.
* In {product-title} 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.
+
If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.1 to 4.8, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. It is recommended to revoke unauthenticated access unless there is a specific need for it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP `403` errors if you revoke unauthenticated access.
====
+
Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:
+
[source,bash]
----
## Snippet to remove unauthenticated group from all the cluster role bindings
$ for clusterrolebinding in cluster-status-binding discovery system:basic-user system:discovery system:openshift:discovery ;
do
### Find the index of unauthenticated group in list of subjects
index=$(oc get clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} -o json | jq 'select(.subjects!=null) | .subjects | map(.name=="system:unauthenticated") | index(true)');
### Remove the element at index from subjects array
oc patch clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} --type=json --patch "[{'op': 'remove','path': '/subjects/$index'}]";
done
----
+
This script removes unauthenticated subjects from the following cluster role bindings:
+
--
** `cluster-status-binding`
** `discovery`
** `system:basic-user`
** `system:discovery`
** `system:openshift:discovery`
--
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821771[*BZ#1821771*])

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.9 and beyond!
* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])

* The assignment of egress IP addresses to control plane nodes with the egress IP feature is not supported on a cluster provisioned on Amazon Web Services (AWS). (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2039656[*BZ#2039656*])

* Previously, there was a race condition between {rh-openstack-first} credentials secret creation and `kube-controller-manager` startup. As a result, {rh-openstack-first} cloud provider would not be configured with {rh-openstack} credentials and would break support when creating Octavia load balancers for `LoadBalancer` services. To work around this, you must restart the `kube-controller-manager` pods by deleting the pods manually from the manifests. When you use the workaround, the `kube-controller-manager` pods restart and {rh-openstack} credentials are properly configured. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2004542[*BZ#2004542*])

* The ability to delete operands from the web console using the `delete all operands` option is currently disabled. It will be re-enabled in a future version of {product-title}. For more information, see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2012120[BZ#2012120] and link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2012971[BZ#2012971].

* This release contains a known issue with Jenkins. If you customize the hostname and certificate of the OpenShift OAuth route, Jenkins no longer trusts the OAuth server endpoint. As a result, users cannot log in to the Jenkins console if they rely on the OpenShift OAuth integration to manage identity and access.
+
Workaround: See the Red Hat Knowledge base solution, link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6470721[Deploy Jenkins on OpenShift with Custom OAuth Server URL]. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1991448[*BZ#1991448*])

* This release contains a known issue with Jenkins. The `xmlstarlet` command line toolkit, which is required to validate or query XML files, is missing from this {op-system-base}-based image. This issue impacts deployments that do not use OpenShift OAuth for authentication. Although OpenShift OAuth is enabled by default, users can disable it.
+
Workaround: Use OpenShift OAuth for authentication. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2055653[BZ#2055653])

* Google Cloud Platform (GCP) UPI installation fails when the instance group name is longer than the maximum size of 64 characters. You are restricted in the naming process after adding the "-instance-group" suffix. Shorten the suffix to "-ig" to reduce the number of characters. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1921627[*BZ#1921627*])

* For clusters that run on {rh-openstack} and use Kuryr, a bug in the OVN Provider driver for Octavia can cause load balancer listeners to be stuck in a `PENDING_UPDATE` state while the load balancer that they are attached to remains in an `ACTIVE` state. As a result, the `kuryr-controller` pod can crash. To resolve this problem, update {rh-openstack} to a version that includes a fix as soon as possible. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2019980[*BZ#20004542*])

* If an incorrect network is specified in the vSphere `install-config.yaml` file, then an error message from Terraform is generated after a while. Add a check during the creation of manifests to notify the user if the network is invalid. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1956776[*BZ#1956776*])

* The Special Resource Operator (SRO) might fail to install on Google Cloud Platform due to a software-defined network policy. As a result, the simple-kmod pod is not created. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1996916[*BZ#1996916*])

* Currently, idling a stateful set is unsupported when you run `oc idle` for a service that is mapped to a stateful set. There is no known workaround at this time. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1976894[*BZ#1976894*])

*  The China (Nanjing) and UAE (Dubai) regions of Alibaba Cloud International Portal accounts do not support installer-provisioned infrastructure (IPI) installations. The China (Guangzhou) and China (Ulanqab) regions do not support a Server Load Balancer (SLB) if using Alibaba Cloud International Portal accounts and, therefore, also do not support IPI installations.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2048062[*BZ#2048062*])

* Currently, the *Knative Serving - Revision CPU, Memory, and Network usage* and *Knative Serving - Revision Queue proxy Metrics* dashboards are visible to all the namespaces, including those that do not have Knative services. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2056682[BZ#2056682])

* Currently, in the *Developer* perspective, the *Observe* dashboard opens for the most recently viewed workload rather than the one you selected in the *Topology* view. This issue happens because the session uses the Redux store rather than the query parameters in the URL. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2052953[BZ#2052953])

* Currently, the *ProjectHelmChartRepository* custom resource (CR) does not show up in the cluster because the API schema for this CR has not been initialized in the cluster yet. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2054197[BZ#2054197])

* Currently, while running high-volume pipeline logs, the auto-scroll functionality does not work and logs are stuck showing older messages. This issue happens because running high-volume pipeline logs generates a large number of calls to the `scrollIntoView` method. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2014161[BZ#2014161])

* Currently, when you use the *Import from Git* form to import a private Git repository, the correct import type and a builder image are not identified. This issue happens because the secret to fetch the private repository details is not decoded. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2053501[*BZ#2053501*])

* During an upgrade of the monitoring stack, Prometheus and Alertmanager might become briefly unavailable. No workaround for this issue is necessary because the components will be available after a short time has passed. No user intervention is required. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2030539[*BZ#203059*])

* For this release, monitoring stack components have been updated to use TLS authentication for metrics collection. However, sometimes Prometheus tries to keep HTTP connections to metrics targets open using expired TLS credentials even after new ones have been provided. Authentication errors then occur, and some metrics targets become unavailable. When this issue occurs, a `TargetDown` alert will fire. To work around this issue, restart the pods that are reported as down. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2033575[*BZ#2033575*])

* For this release, the number of Alertmanager replicas in the monitoring stack was reduced from three to two. However, the persistent volume claim (PVC) for the removed third replica is not automatically removed as part of the upgrade process. After the upgrade, an administrator can remove this PVC manually from the Cluster Monitoring Operator. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2040131[*BZ#2040131*])

* In the default ZTP Argo CD configuration, cluster names cannot begin with `ztp`. Using names starting with `ztp` for clusters deployed with Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) results in provisioning not completing. As a workaround, ensure that either cluster names do not start with `ztp`, or adjust the Argo CD policy application namespace to a pattern that excludes the names of your clusters but still matches your policy namespace. For example, if your cluster names start with `ztp`, change the pattern in the Argo CD policy app configuration to something different, like `ztp-`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2049154[*BZ#2049154*])

* Previously, the `oc adm must-gather` tool did not collect performance specific data when more than one `--image` argument was supplied. Files, including node and performance related files, were missing when the operation finished. The issue affects {product-title} versions between 4.7 and 4.10. This issue can be resolved by executing the `oc adm must-gather` operation twice, once for each image. As a result, all expected files can be collected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2018159[*BZ#2018159*])

* When using the Technology Preview oc-mirror CLI plug-in, there is a known issue that can occur when updating your cluster after mirroring an updated image set to the mirror registry. If a new version of an Operator is published to a channel by deleting the previous version of that Operator and then replacing it with a new version, an error can occur when applying the generated `CatalogSource` file from the oc-mirror plug-in, because the catalog is seen as invalid. As a workaround, delete the previous catalog image from the mirror registry, generate and publish a new differential image set, and then apply the `CatalogSource` file to the cluster. You must follow this workaround each time you publish a new differential image set, until this issue is resolved. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2060837[*BZ#2060837*])

* The processing of the `StoragePVC` custom resource during the GitOps ZTP flow does not exclude the `volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class` annotation when a user does not include a value for it. This annotation causes the `spec.storageClassName` field to be ignored. To avoid this, set the desired `StorageClass` name in the `volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class` annotation within your `PolicyGenTemplate` when using a `StoragePVC` custom resource. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2060554[*BZ#2060554*])

* Removing a Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) custom profile enabled on a border gateway protocol (BGP) peer resource does not disable the BFD. Instead, the BGP peer starts using the default BFD  profile. To disable BFD from a BGP peer resource, delete the BGP peer configuration
and recreate it without a BFD profile. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2050824[*BZ#2050824*])

* For clusters that run on {rh-openstack} and use Mellanox NICs as part of a single-root I/O virtualization configuration (SR-IOV), you may not be able to create a pod after you start one, restart the SR-IOV device plugin, and then stop the pod. No workaround is available for this issue.
