[id="ocp-4-10-ibm-cloud-installation"]
==== Installing a cluster on IBM Cloud using installer-provisioned infrastructure

{product-title} 4.10 introduces support for installing a cluster on IBM Cloud using installer-provisioned infrastructure.

//For more information, see ../installing/installing_ibm_cloud_public/preparing-to-install-on-ibm-cloud.adoc#preparing-to-install-on-ibm-cloud[Preparing to install on IBM Cloud].

[id="ocp-4-10-installation-and-upgrade-vsphere-provisioning"]
==== Thin provisioning support for VMware vSphere cluster installation

{product-title} {product-version} introduces support for thin provisioned disks when you install a cluster using installer-provisioned infrastructure. You can provision disks as `thin`, `thick`, or `eagerZeroedThick`. For more information about disk provisioning modes in VMware vSphere, see xref:../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-customizations.html#installation-configuration-parameters_installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-customizations[Installation configuration parameters].

[id="ocp-4-10-installation-and-upgrade-aws-ami"]
==== Installing a cluster into an Amazon Web Services GovCloud region

{op-system-first} Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are now available for AWS GovCloud regions. The availability of these AMIs improves the installation process because you are no longer required to upload a custom RHCOS AMI to deploy a cluster.
//For more information on installing to a AWS GovCloud region, <insert link to topic after it merges>

[id="ocp-4-10-installation-and-upgrade-tagrole"]
==== Using a custom AWS IAM role for instance profiles

Beginning with {product-title} {product-version}, if you configure a cluster with an existing IAM role, the installer no longer adds the `shared` tag to the role when deploying the cluster. This enhancement improves the installation process for organizations that want to use a custom IAM role, but whose security policies prevent the use of the `shared` tag.

[id="ocp-4-10-installation-vsphere-csi"]
==== CSI driver installation on vSphere clusters

To install a CSI driver on a cluster running on vSphere, you must have the following components installed:

* Virtual hardware version 15 or greater
* vSphere version 6.7 Update 3 or greater
* VMware ESXi version 6.7 Update 3 or greater

These components are still supported, but are deprecated; support for them will be removed in a future version of {product-title}.

[id="ocp-4-10-conditional-updates"]
==== Conditional updates

{product-title} 4.10 adds support for consuming conditional update paths provided by the OpenShift Update Service.
Conditional update paths convey identified risks and the conditions under which those risks apply to clusters.
The Administrator perspective on the web console only offers recommended upgrade paths for which the cluster does not match known risks.
However, OpenShift CLI (`oc`) 4.10 or later can be used to display additional upgrade paths for {product-title} 4.10 clusters.
Associated risk information including supporting documentation references is displayed with the paths.
The administrator may review the referenced materials and choose to perform the supported, but no longer recommended, upgrade.

For more information, see xref:../updating/understanding-upgrade-channels-release.adoc#conditional-updates-overview_understanding-upgrade-channels-releases[Conditional updates] and xref:../updating/updating-cluster-cli.adoc#update-conditional-upgrade-pathupdating-cluster-cli[Updating along a conditional upgrade path].

[id="ocp-4-10-redfish-events"]
==== Low-latency Redfish hardware event delivery (Technology Preview)

{product-title} now provides a hardware event proxy that enables applications running on bare-metal clusters to respond quickly to Redfish hardware events, such as hardware changes and failures.

The hardware event proxy supports a publish-subscribe service that allows relevant applications to consume hardware events detected by Redfish. The proxy must be running on hardware that supports Redfish v1.8 and higher. An Operator manages the lifecycle of the `hw-event-proxy` container.

You can use a REST API to develop applications to consume and respond to events such as breaches of temperature thresholds, fan failure, disk loss, power outages, and memory failure. Reliable end-to-end messaging without persistent stores is based on the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). The latency of the messaging service is in the 10 millisecond range.

[NOTE]
====
This feature is supported for single node OpenShift clusters only.
====

[id="ocp-4-10-networking-ovn-gateway-config"]
==== OVN-Kubernetes support for gateway configuration

The OVN-Kubernetes CNI network provider adds support for configuring how egress traffic is sent to the node gateway.
By default, egress traffic is processed in OVN to exit the cluster and traffic is not affected by specialized routes in the kernel routing table.

This enhancement adds a `gatewayConfig.routingViaHost` field.
With this update, the field can be set at runtime as a post-installation activity and when it is set to `true`, egress traffic is sent from pods to the host networking stack.
This update benefits highly-specialized installations and applications that rely on manually configured routes in the kernel routing table.

This enhancement has an interaction with the Open vSwitch hardware offloading feature.
With this update, when the `gatewayConfig.routingViaHost` field is set to `true`, you do not receive the performance benefits of the offloading because egress traffic is processed by the host networking stack.

For configuration information, see xref:../networking/cluster-network-operator.adoc#nw-operator-configuration-parameters-for-ovn-sdn_cluster-network-operator[Configuration for the OVN-Kubernetes CNI cluster network provider].

[id="ocp-4-10-networking-metrics"]
==== Enhancements to networking metrics

The following metrics are now available for clusters.
The metric names that start with `sdn_controller` are unique to the OpenShift SDN CNI network provider.
The metric names that start with `ovn` are unique to the OVN-Kubernetes CNI network provider:

* `network_attachment_definition_instances{networks="egress-router"}`
* `openshift_unidle_events_total`
* `ovn_controller_bfd_run`
* `ovn_controller_ct_zone_commit`
* `ovn_controller_flow_generation`
* `ovn_controller_flow_installation`
* `ovn_controller_if_status_mgr`
* `ovn_controller_if_status_mgr_run`
* `ovn_controller_if_status_mgr_update`
* `ovn_controller_integration_bridge_openflow_total`
* `ovn_controller_ofctrl_seqno_run`
* `ovn_controller_patch_run`
* `ovn_controller_pinctrl_run`
* `ovnkube_master_ipsec_enabled`
* `ovnkube_master_num_egress_firewall_rules`
* `ovnkube_master_num_egress_firewalls`
* `ovnkube_master_num_egress_ips`
* `ovnkube_master_pod_first_seen_lsp_created_duration_seconds`
* `ovnkube_master_pod_lsp_created_port_binding_duration_seconds`
* `ovnkube_master_pod_port_binding_chassis_port_binding_up_duration_seconds`
* `ovnkube_master_pod_port_binding_port_binding_chassis_duration_seconds`
* `sdn_controller_num_egress_firewall_rules`
* `sdn_controller_num_egress_firewalls`
* `sdn_controller_num_egress_ips`

The `ovnkube_master_resource_update_total` metric is removed for the 4.10 release.

[id="ocp-4-10-networking-must-gather-tcpdump"]
==== Enhancement to must-gather to simplify network tracing

The `oc adm must-gather` command is enhanced in a way that simplifies collecting network packet captures.

Previously, `oc adm must-gather` could start a single debug pod only.
With this enhancement, you can start a debug pod on multiple nodes at the same time.

You can use the enhancement to run packet captures on multiple nodes at the same time to simplify troubleshooting network communication issues.
A new `--node-selector` argument provides a way to identify which nodes you are collecting packet captures for.

For more information, see xref:../support/gathering-cluster-data.adoc#support-network-trace-methods_gathering-cluster-data[Network trace methods] and xref:../support/gathering-cluster-data.adoc#support-collecting-host-network-trace_gathering-cluster-data[Collecting a host network trace].

[id="ocp-4-10-egress-ip-support-public-clouds"]
=== Egress IP address support for clusters installed on public clouds

As a cluster administrator, you can associate one or more egress IP addresses with a namespace. An egress IP address ensures that a consistent source IP address is associated with traffic from a particular namespace that is leaving the cluster.

For the OVN-Kubernetes and OpenShift SDN cluster network providers, you can configure an egress IP address on the following public cloud providers:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* Microsoft Azure

To learn more, refer to the respective documentation for your cluster network provider:

* OVN-Kubernetes: xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/configuring-egress-ips-ovn.adoc#configuring-egress-ips-ovn[Configuring an egress IP address]
* OpenShift SDN: xref:../networking/openshift_sdn/assigning-egress-ips.adoc#egress-ips[Configuring egress IPs for a project]

[id="ocp-4-10-openshift-sdn-netpol-egress-policies"]
==== OpenShift SDN cluster network provider network policy support for egress policies and ipBlock except

If you use the OpenShift SDN cluster network provider, you can now use egress rules in network policy with `ipBlock` and `ipBlock.except`. You define egress policies in the `egress` array of the `NetworkPolicy` object.

For more information, refer to xref:../networking/network_policy/about-network-policy.adoc#about-network-policy[About network policy].

[id="ocp-4-10-ne-router-compression"]
==== Ingress Controller router compression
This enhancement adds the ability to configure global HTTP traffic compression on the HAProxy Ingress Controller for specific MIME types. This update enables gzip-compression of your ingress workloads when there are large amounts of compressible routed traffic.

For more information, see xref:../networking/ingress-operator.adoc#nw-configuring-router-compression_configuring-ingress[Using router compression].

[id="ocp-4-10-ne-coredns-customization"]
==== Support for CoreDNS customization
A cluster administrator can now configure DNS servers to allow DNS name resolution through the configured servers for the default domain. A DNS forwarding configuration can have both the default servers specified in the `/etc/resolv.conf` file and the upstream DNS servers.

For more information, see xref:../networking/dns-operator.adoc#nw-dns-forward_dns-operator[Using DNS forwarding].

[id="ocp-4-10-ne-syslog-maxlength"]
==== Support for configuring the maximum length of the syslog message in the Ingress Controller
You can now set the maximum length of the syslog message in the Ingress Controller to any value between 480 and 4096 bytes.

For more information, see xref:../networking/ingress-operator.adoc#nw-ingress-controller-configuration-parameters_configuring-ingress[Ingress Controller configuration parameters].

[id="ocp-4-10-networking-metallb"]
==== Enhancements to MetalLB load balancing

The following enhancements to MetalLB and the MetalLB Operator are included in this release:

* Support for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is added.
* Support for Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) in combination with BGP is added.
* Support for IPv6 and dual-stack networking is added.
* Support for specifying a node selector on the `speaker` pods is added. You can now control which nodes are used for advertising load balancer service IP addresses. This enhancement applies to layer 2 mode and BGP mode.
* Validating web hooks are added to ensure that addresss pool and BGP peer custom resources are valid.
* The `v1alpha1` API version for the `AddressPool` and `MetalLB` custom resource definitions that were introduced in the 4.9 release are deprecated. Both custom resources are updated to the `v1beta1` API version.
* Support for speaker pod tolerations in the MetalLB custom resrouce definition is added.

For more information, see xref:../networking/metallb/about-metallb.adoc#about-metallb[About MetalLB and the MetalLB Operator].

[id="ocp-4-10-mco-config-drift"]
==== Enhanced configuration drift detection

With this enhancement, the Machine Config Daemon (MCD) now checks nodes for configuration drift if a filesystem write event occurs for any of the files specified in the machine config and before a new machine config is applied, in addition to node bootup. Previously, the MCD checked for configuration drift only at node bootup. This change was made because node reboots do not occur frequently enough to avoid the problems caused by configuration drift until an administrator can correct the issue.

Configuration drift occurs when the on-disk state of a node differs from what is configured in the machine config. The Machine Config Operator (MCO) uses the MCD to check nodes for configuration drift and, if detected, sets that node and machine config pool (MCP) to `degraded`.

For more information on configuration drift, see xref:../post_installation_configuration/machine-configuration-tasks.adoc#machine-config-drift-detection_post-install-machine-configuration-tasks[Understanding configuration drift detection].

You can now enable link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html[Linux control groups version 2] (cgroups v2) on specific nodes in your cluster. The {product-title} process for enabling cgroups v2 disables all cgroups version 1 controllers and hierarchies. The {product-title} cgroups version 2 feature is in Developer Preview and is not supported by Red Hat at this time.

[id="ocp-4-10-logging"]

[id="ocp-4-10-insights-operator-sca"]
==== Importing simple content access certificates

In {product-title} 4.10, Insights Operator now imports your simple content access certificates from {console-redhat-com} by default.

For more information, see xref:../support/remote_health_monitoring/insights-operator-simple-access.adoc[Importing simple content access certificates with Insights Operator].

[id="ocp-4-10-insights-operator-data-collection-enhancements"]
==== Insights Operator data collection enhancements

To reduce the amount of data sent to Red Hat, Insights Operator only gathers information when certain conditions are met. For example, Insights Operator only gathers the Alertmanager logs when Alertmanager fails to send alert notifications.


In {product-title} 4.10, the Insights Operator collects the following additional information:

* (Conditional) The logs from pods where the `KubePodCrashlooping` and `KubePodNotReady` alerts are firing
* (Conditional) The Alertmanager logs when the `AlertmanagerClusterFailedToSendAlerts` or `AlertmanagerFailedToSendAlerts` alerts are firing
* Silenced alerts from Alertmanager
* The node logs from the journal unit (kubelet)
* The `CostManagementMetricsConfig` from clusters with `costmanagement-metrics-operator` installed
* The time series database status from the monitoring stack Prometheus instance
* Additional information about the {product-title} scheduler

With this additional information, Red Hat improves {product-title} functionality and enhances Insights Advisor recommendations.

[id="ocp-4-10-auth"]
=== Authentication and authorization

[id="ocp-4-10-auth-sync-group-membership"]
==== Syncing group membership from OpenID Connect identity providers

This release introduces support for synchronizing group membership from an OpenID Connect provider to {product-title} upon user login. You can enable this by configuring the `groups` claim in the {product-title} OpenID Connect identity provider configuration.

For more information, see xref:../authentication/identity_providers/configuring-oidc-identity-provider.adoc#identity-provider-oidc-CR_configuring-oidc-identity-provider[Sample OpenID Connect CRs].

[id="ocp-4-10-oc-commands-obtain-credentials-from-podman-config"]
==== oc commands now obtain credentials from Podman configuration locations

Previously, `oc` commands that used the registry configuration, for example `oc login` or `oc image`, obtained credentials from Docker configuration locations. With {product-title} {product-version}, if a registry entry cannot be found in the default Docker configuration location, `oc` commands obtain the credentials from Podman configuration locations. You can set your preference to either `docker` or `podman` by using the `REGISTRY_AUTH_PREFERENCE` environment variable to prioritize the location.

Users also have the option to use the `REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE` environment variable, which serves as an alternative to the existing `--registry-config` CLI flag. The `REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE` environment variable is also compatible with `podman`.

[id="ocp-4-10-cluster-cloud-controller-manager-operator"]
==== Cloud controller managers for additional cloud providers

The Kubernetes community plans to deprecate the Kubernetes controller manager in favor of using cloud controller managers to interact with underlying cloud platforms. As a result, there is no plan to add Kubernetes controller manager support for any new cloud platforms. The Alibaba Cloud and IBM Cloud implementations that are added in this release of {product-title} use cloud controller managers.

In addition, this release supports using cloud controller managers for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and VMware vSphere as a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview].

To learn more about the cloud controller manager, see the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller/[Kubernetes Cloud Controller Manager documentation].

To manage the cloud controller manager and cloud node manager deployments and lifecycles, use the Cluster Cloud Controller Manager Operator.

For more information, see the xref:../operators/operator-reference.adoc#cluster-cloud-controller-manager-operator_platform-operators-ref[Cluster Cloud Controller Manager Operator] entry in the _Platform Operators reference_.

== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.8 and beyond! This needs some SME/QE review before being updated for 4.9.
* In {product-title} 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.
+
If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.1 to 4.8, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. It is recommended to revoke unauthenticated access unless there is a specific need for it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP `403` errors if you revoke unauthenticated access.
====
+
Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:
+
[source,bash]
----
## Snippet to remove unauthenticated group from all the cluster role bindings
$ for clusterrolebinding in cluster-status-binding discovery system:basic-user system:discovery system:openshift:discovery ;
do
### Find the index of unauthenticated group in list of subjects
index=$(oc get clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} -o json | jq 'select(.subjects!=null) | .subjects | map(.name=="system:unauthenticated") | index(true)');
### Remove the element at index from subjects array
oc patch clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} --type=json --patch "[{'op': 'remove','path': '/subjects/$index'}]";
done
----
+
This script removes unauthenticated subjects from the following cluster role bindings:
+
--
** `cluster-status-binding`
** `discovery`
** `system:basic-user`
** `system:discovery`
** `system:openshift:discovery`
--
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821771[*BZ#1821771*])

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.9 and beyond!
* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])

* The assignment of egress IP addresses to control plane nodes with the EgressIP feature is not supported on a cluster provisioned on Amazon Web Services (AWS). (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2039656[*BZ#2039656*])

[id="ocp-4-10-asynchronous-errata-updates"]
== Asynchronous errata updates

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for {product-title} {product-version} are released as asynchronous errata through the Red Hat Network. All {product-title} {product-version} errata is https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[available on the Red Hat Customer Portal]. See the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} Life Cycle] for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account settings for Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications are enabled, users are notified via email whenever new errata relevant to their registered systems are released.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming {product-title} entitlements for {product-title} errata notification emails to generate.
====

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of {product-title} {product-version}. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form {product-title} {product-version}.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any {product-title} release, always review the instructions on xref:../updating/updating-cluster-within-minor.adoc#updating-cluster-within-minor[updating your cluster] properly.
