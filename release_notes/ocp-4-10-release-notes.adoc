== About this release

// TODO: Update k8s link once there is a version-specific URL for the Kubernetes release
{product-title} *(link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3759[RHSA-2021:3759])* is now available. This release uses *link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md[Kubernetes 1.22]* with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

//Red Hat did not publicly release {product-title} 4.10.0 as the GA version and, instead, is releasing {product-title} 4.10.TBD as the GA version.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift. The {cloud-redhat-com} application for {product-title} allows you to deploy OpenShift clusters to either on-premise or cloud environments.

// Double check OP system versions
{product-title} {product-version} is supported on {op-system-base-full} 7.9 and 8.4, as well as on {op-system-first} 4.9.

== {product-title} layered and dependent component support and compatibility

The scope of support for layered and dependent components of {product-title} changes independently of the {product-title} version. To determine the current support status and compatibility for an add-on, refer to its release notes. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

[id="ocp-4-10-new-features-and-enhancements"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

=== Installation and upgrade

[id="ocp-4-10-ibm-cloud-installation"]
==== Installing a cluster on IBM Cloud using installer-provisioned infrastructure

{product-title} 4.10 introduces support for installing a cluster on IBM Cloud using installer-provisioned infrastructure.

//For more information, see ../installing/installing_ibm_cloud_public/preparing-to-install-on-ibm-cloud.adoc#preparing-to-install-on-ibm-cloud[Preparing to install on IBM Cloud].

[id="ocp-4-10-installation-and-upgrade-aws-ami"]
==== Installing a cluster into an Amazon Web Services GovCloud region

{op-system-first} Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are now available for AWS GovCloud regions. The availability of these AMIs improves the installation process because you are no longer required to upload a custom RHCOS AMI to deploy a cluster.
//For more information on installing to a AWS GovCloud region, <insert link to topic after it merges>

[id="ocp-4-10-conditional-updates"]
=== Conditional updates

{product-title} 4.10 adds support for consuming conditional update paths provided by the OpenShift Update Service.
Conditional update paths convey identified risks and the conditions under which those risks apply to clusters.
The Administrator perspective on the web console only offers recommended upgrade paths for which the cluster does not match known risks.
However, OpenShift CLI (`oc`) 4.10 or later can be used to display additional upgrade paths for {product-title} 4.10 clusters.
Associated risk information including supporting documentation references is displayed with the paths.
The administrator may review the referenced materials and choose to perform the supported, but no longer recommended, upgrade.

For more information, see xref:../updating/understanding-upgrade-channels-release.adoc#conditional-updates-overview_understanding-upgrade-channels-releases[Conditional updates] and xref:../updating/updating-cluster-cli.adoc#update-conditional-upgrade-pathupdating-cluster-cli[Updating along a conditional upgrade path].

==== Enhancements to networking metrics

The following metrics are now available for clusters.
The metric names that start with `sdn_controller` are unique to the OpenShift SDN CNI network provider.
The metric names that start with `ovn` are unique to the OVN-Kubernetes CNI network provider:

* `network_attachment_definition_instances{networks="egress-router"}`
* `openshift_unidle_events_total`
* `ovn_controller_bfd_run`
* `ovn_controller_ct_zone_commit`
* `ovn_controller_flow_generation`

The `ovnkube_master_resource_update_total` metric is removed for the 4.10 release.

[id="ocp-4-10-networking-must-gather-tcpdump"]
==== Enhancement to must-gather to simplify network tracing

The `oc adm must-gather` command is enhanced in a way that simplifies collecting network packet captures.
Previously, `oc adm must-gather` could start a single debug pod only.
With this enhancement, you can start a debug pod on multiple nodes at the same time.

You can use the enhancement to run packet captures on multiple nodes at the same time to simplify troubleshooting network communication issues.
A new `--node-selector` argument provides a way to identify which nodes you are collecting packet captures for.

For more information, see xref:../support/gathering-cluster-data.adoc#support-network-trace-methods_gathering-cluster-data[Network trace methods] and xref:../support/gathering-cluster-data.adoc#support-collecting-host-network-trace_gathering-cluster-data[Collecting a host network trace].

[id="ocp-4-10-networking-metallb"]
==== Enhancements to MetalLB load balancing

The following enhancements to MetalLB and the MetalLB Operator are included in this release:

* Support for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is added.
* Support for Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) in combination with BGP is added.
* Support for IPv6 and dual-stack networking is added.
* Support for specifying a node selector on the `speaker` pods is added so you can control which nodes are used for load balancer IP addresses. This enhancement applies to layer 2 mode and BGP mode.
* Validating web hooks are added to ensure that addresss pool and BGP peer custom resources are valid.
* The `v1alpha1` API version for the `AddressPool` and `MetalLB` custom resource definitions that were introduced in the 4.9 release are deprecated. Both custom resources are updated to the `v1beta1` API version.

For more information, see xref:../networking/metallb/about-metallb.adoc#about-metallb[About MetalLB and the MetalLB Operator].

[id="ocp-4-10-mco-config-drift"]
==== Enhanced configuration drift detection

With this enhancement, the Machine Config Daemon (MCD) now checks nodes for configuration drift if a filesystem write event occurs for any of the files specified in the machine config and before a new machine config is applied, in addition to node bootup. Previously, the MCD checked for configuration drift only at node bootup. This change was made because node reboots do not occur frequently enough to avoid the problems caused by configuration drift until an administrator can correct the issue.

Configuration drift occurs when the on-disk state of a node differs from what is configured in the machine config. The Machine Config Operator (MCO) uses the MCD to check nodes for configuration drift and, if detected, sets that node and machine config pool (MCP) to `degraded`.

For more information on configuration drift, see xref:../post_installation_configuration/machine-configuration-tasks.adoc#machine-config-drift-detection_post-install-machine-configuration-tasks[Understanding configuration drift detection].

[id="ocp-4-10-known-issues"]
== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.8 and beyond! This needs some SME/QE review before being updated for 4.9.
* In {product-title} 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.
+
If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.1 to 4.8, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. It is recommended to revoke unauthenticated access unless there is a specific need for it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP `403` errors if you revoke unauthenticated access.
====
+
Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:
+
[source,bash]
----
## Snippet to remove unauthenticated group from all the cluster role bindings
$ for clusterrolebinding in cluster-status-binding discovery system:basic-user system:discovery system:openshift:discovery ;
do
### Find the index of unauthenticated group in list of subjects
index=$(oc get clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} -o json | jq 'select(.subjects!=null) | .subjects | map(.name=="system:unauthenticated") | index(true)');
### Remove the element at index from subjects array
oc patch clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} --type=json --patch "[{'op': 'remove','path': '/subjects/$index'}]";
done
----
+
This script removes unauthenticated subjects from the following cluster role bindings:
+
--
** `cluster-status-binding`
** `discovery`
** `system:basic-user`
** `system:discovery`
** `system:openshift:discovery`
--
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821771[*BZ#1821771*])

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.9 and beyond!
* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])
