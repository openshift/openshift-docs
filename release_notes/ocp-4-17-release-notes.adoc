== About this release

// TODO: Update with the relevant information closer to release.
{product-title} (link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:XXXX[RHSA-2024:XXXX]) is now available. This release uses link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.30.md[Kubernetes 1.30] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at https://console.redhat.com/openshift. With the {cluster-manager-first} application for {product-title}, you can deploy {product-title} clusters to either on-premises or cloud environments.

// Double check OP system versions
{product-title} {product-version} is supported on {op-system-base-full} 8.8-8.10, and on {op-system-first} 9.4.

You must use {op-system} machines for the control plane, and you can use either {op-system} or {op-system-base} for compute machines. {op-system-base} machines are deprecated in {product-title} 4.16 and will be removed in a future release.
//Removed the note per https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GRPA-3517

//Even-numbered release lifecycle verbiage (Comment in for even-numbered releases)
//Starting from {product-title} 4.14, the Extended Update Support (EUS) phase for even-numbered releases increases the total available lifecycle to 24 months on all supported architectures, including `x86_64`, 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), and {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architectures.
//Beyond this, Red{nbsp}Hat also offers a 12-month additional EUS add-on, denoted as _Additional EUS Term 2_, that extends the total available lifecycle from 24 months to 36 months. The Additional EUS Term 2 is available on all architecture variants of {product-title}.

//Odd-numbered release lifecycle verbiage (Comment in for odd-numbered releases)
The support lifecycle for odd-numbered releases, such as {product-title} {product-version}, on all supported architectures, including `x86_64`, 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), and {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architectures is 18 months.
For more information about support for all versions, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

Commencing with the {product-title} 4.14 release, Red{nbsp}Hat is simplifying the administration and management of Red{nbsp}Hat shipped cluster Operators with the introduction of three new life cycle classifications; Platform Aligned, Platform Agnostic, and Rolling Stream. These life cycle classifications provide additional ease and transparency for cluster administrators to understand the life cycle policies of each Operator and form cluster maintenance and upgrade plans with predictable support boundaries. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/j/includes/session/scribe/?redirectTo=https%3A%2F%2Faccess.redhat.com%2Fsupport%2Fpolicy%2Fupdates%2Fopenshift_operators[OpenShift Operator Life Cycles].

// Added in 4.14. Language came directly from Kirsten Newcomer.
{product-title} is designed for FIPS. When running {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures.

For more information about the NIST validation program, see link:https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules[Cryptographic Module Validation Program]. For the latest NIST status for the individual versions of {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted for validation, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2918071#fips-140-2-and-fips-140-3-2[Compliance Activities and Government Standards].

[id="ocp-4-17-networking-azure-support-nmstate-operator_{context}"]
==== Microsoft Azure for the Kubernetes NMState Operator

Red{nbsp}Hat support exists for using the Kubernetes NMState Operator on {azure-first} but in a limited capacity. Support is limited to configuring DNS servers on your system as a postinstallation task.

For more information, see xref:../networking/k8s_nmstate/k8s-nmstate-about-the-k8s-nmstate-operator.adoc#k8s-nmstate-about-the-k8s-nmstate-operator_k8s-nmstate-operator[About the Kubernetes NMState Operator].

[id="ocp-4-17-networking-nmstate-operator-metrics_{context}"]
==== View metrics collected by the Kubernetes NMState Operator

The Kubernetes NMState Operator, `kubernetes-nmstate-operator`, can collect metrics from the `kubernetes_nmstate_features_applied` component and expose them as ready-to-use metrics. You can view these metrics by using the *Administrator* and *Developer* perspectives.

For more information, see xref:../networking/k8s_nmstate/k8s-nmstate-about-the-k8s-nmstate-operator.adoc#viewing-stats-collected-kubernetes-nmtate-op_k8s-nmstate-operator[Viewing metrics collected by the Kubernetes NMState Operator].

[id="ocp-ptp-fast-events-rest-api-v2-available_{context}"]
==== New PTP fast events REST API version 2 available

A new PTP fast events O-RAN Release 3 compliant REST API version 2 is available.
Now, you can develop PTP event consumer applications that receive host hardware PTP events directly from the PTP Operator-managed pod.
The PTP fast events REST API v1 will be deprecated in a future release.

[NOTE]
====
In link:https://orandownloadsweb.azurewebsites.net/download?id=344[O-RAN O-Cloud Notification API Specification for Event Consumers 3.0], the resource is defined as a hierarchical path for the subsystem that produces the notifications.
The PTP events REST API v2 does not have a global subscription for all lower hierarchy resources contained in the resource path.
You subscribe consumer applications to the various available event types separately.
====

For more information, see xref:../networking/ptp/ptp-cloud-events-consumer-dev-reference-v2.adoc#ptp-cloud-events-consumer-dev-reference-v2[Developing PTP event consumer applications with the REST API v2].

[id="ocp-4-17-nw-coredns-1-11-3"]
==== CoreDNS update to version 1.11.3

{product-title} {product-version} now includes CoreDNS version 1.11.3.

[id="ocp-4-17-nw-metallb"]
==== Changes to MetalLB

With this update, MetalLB uses `FRR-K8s` as the default backend.
Previously, this was an optional feature available in Technology Preview.
For more information, see xref:../networking/metallb/metallb-frr-k8s.adoc#metallb-configure-frr-k8s[Configuring the integration of MetalLB and FRR-K8s].

MetalLB also includes a new field for the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) peer custom resource, `connectTime`.
You can use this field to specify how long BGP waits between connection attempts to a neighbor.
For more information, see xref:../networking/metallb/metallb-configure-bgp-peers.html#nw-metallb-bgppeer-cr_configure-metallb-bgp-peers[About the BGP peer custom resource].

=== Registry

[id="ocp-4-17-chunksizemib-configuration-parameter"]
==== New chunkSizeMiB configuration parameter for S3 registry storage

A new, optional configuration parameter, `chunkSizeMiB`, is now available for deployments using S3 API-compatible backend storage. When configured, it determines the size of the multipart upload chunks for the S3 API. The default value is `10` MiB, with a minimum of `5` MiB.

For more information, see xref:../registry/configuring_registry_storage/configuring-registry-storage-aws-user-infrastructure.adoc#registry-operator-configuration-resource-overview-aws-s3_configuring-registry-storage-aws-user-infrastructure[Image Registry Operator configuration parameters for AWS S3].

[id="ocp-4-17-storage_{context}"]
=== Storage

[id="ocp-4-17-storage-efs-vol-metrics"]
==== AWS EFS CSI storage usage metrics is generally available
Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic File Service (EFS) usage metrics allow you to monitor how much space is used by EFS volumes. This feature is generally available.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Turning on these metrics can lead to performance degradation because the CSI driver walks through the whole volume. Therefore, this option is disabled by default. Administrators must explicitly enable this feature.
====

For more information, see xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-aws-efs.adoc#aws-efs-storage-csi-usage-metrics[Amazon Elastic File CSI Storage usage metrics].

[id="ocp-4-17-storage-control-vol-mode-conversion"]
==== Preventing unauthorized volume mode conversion is generally available
Previously, there was no validation of whether the mode of an original volume (filesystem or raw block), whose snapshot was taken, matches the mode of a newly created volume. This presented a security gap that could allow malicious users to potentially exploit an as-yet-unknown vulnerability in the host operating system.

Nevertheless, some users have a legitimate need to perform such conversions. This feature allows cluster administrators to provide these rights (ability to perform update or patch operations on `VolumeSnapshotContents objects`) only to trusted users or applications, such as backup vendors.

To convert a volume mode, an authorized user needs to change `snapshot.storage.kubernetes.io/allow-volume-mode-change: "true"` for VolumeSnapshotContent of the snapshot source.

This feature is supported as generally available.

[id="ocp-4-17-storage-auto-del-resources-gcp-filestore"]
==== Automatic deletion of resources for GCP Filestore is generally available
In earlier versions of {product-title}, when destroying a cluster, Google Compute Platform (GCP) Filestore Storage did not delete all of the cloud resources belonging to that cluster. This required manually deleting all of the persistent volume claims (PVCs) that used the Filestore storage class before destroying the cluster.

With {product-title} 4.17, when destroying a cluster the {product-title} installer should generally delete all of the cloud resources that belong to that cluster, and therefore manual deletion of PVCs should not be required. However, due to the special nature of the Google Compute Platform (GCP) Filestore resources, the automated cleanup process might not remove all of the resources in some rare cases. This feature is supported as generally available.

For more information, see xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-google-cloud-file.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-google-cloud-file-delete-instances_persistent-storage-csi-google-cloud-file[Destroying clusters and GCP Filestore].

[id="ocp-4-17-nodes_{context}"]
=== Nodes

[id="ocp-4-17-enhancements-nodes-crio-wipe_{context}"]
==== New CRIO command behavior
Beginning in {product-title} 4.17, when a node is rebooted, the `crio wipe` command checks that the CRI-O binary exited cleanly. Those images that did not exit cleanly are targeted as corrupted and removed. This behavior prevents CRI-O from failing to start due to half-pulled images or other unsynced files. In {product-title} 4.15 and 4.16, the `crio wipe` command removed all images when a node was rebooted. The `crio wipe` command’s new behavior increases efficiency while still reducing the risk of image corruption when a node is rebooted.

[id="ocp-4-17-must-gather-new-flags_{context}"]
==== New flags added for must-gather command

{product-title} release {product-version} adds two new flags for use with the `oc adm must-gather` command to limit the timespan of the information gathered. Only one of the following flags can be used at a time. Plugins are encouraged but not required to support these flags.

* `--since`: Only return logs newer than a relative duration, such as 5s, 2m, or 3h. Defaults to all logs.
* `--since-time`: Only return logs after a specific date, expressed in the RFC3339 format. Defaults to all logs.

For a full list of flags to use with the `oc adm must-gather command`, see xref:../support/gathering-cluster-data.adoc#must-gather-flags_gathering-cluster-data[Must-gather flags].

[id="ocp-4-17-nodes-userns_{context}"]
==== Linux user namespaces now supported for pods (Technology Preview)

{product-title} release {product-version} adds support for deploying pods and containers into Linux user namespaces. Running pods and containers in individual user namespaces can mitigate several vulnerabilities that a compromised container can pose to other pods and the node itself. For more information, see xref:../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-user-namespaces.adoc#nodes-pods-user-namespaces[Running pods in Linux user namespaces].

[id="ocp-4-17-nodes-crio-port_{context}"]
==== CRI-O metrics port now uses TLS

{product-title} monitoring now uses a TLS-backed endpoint to fetch CRI-O container runtime metrics. These certificates are managed by the system and not the user. {product-title} monitoring queries have been updated to the new port. For information on the certificates used by monitoring, see xref:../security/certificate_types_descriptions/monitoring-and-cluster-logging-operator-component-certificates.adoc#cert-types-monitoring-and-cluster-logging-operator-component-certificates[Monitoring and OpenShift Logging Operator component certificates].

[id="ocp-4-17-cro_{context}"]
=== Cluster Resource Override Admission Operator

[id="ocp-4-17-cro-infra_{context}"]
==== Moving the Cluster Resource Override Operator

By default, the installation process creates a Cluster Resource Override Operator pod on a worker node and two Cluster Resource Override pods on control plane nodes. You can move these pods to other nodes, such as an infrastructure node, as needed. For more information, see xref:../nodes/clusters/nodes-cluster-overcommit.adoc#nodes-cluster-resource-override-move-infra_nodes-cluster-overcommit[Moving the Cluster Resource Override Operator pods].

[id="ocp-4-17-cro-deploy_{context}"]
=== Cluster Resource Override Operator pod is owned by a deployment object

The Cluster Resource Override Operator pod is now owned by a deployment object. Previously, the Operator was owned by a daemon set object. Using a deployment for the Operator addresses a number of issues, including additional security and add the ability to run the pods on worker nodes.

[id="ocp-4-17-edge-computing-managing-firmware-with-ztp_{context}"]
==== Managing host firmware settings with {ztp}

You can now configure host firmware settings for managed clusters that you deploy with {ztp}.
You save host profile YAML files alongside `SiteConfig` custom resources (CRs) that you use to deploy the managed clusters.
{ztp} uses the host profiles to configure firmware settings in the managed cluster hosts during deployment.
On the hub cluster, you can use `FirmwareSchema` CRs to discover managed cluster host firmware schema, and `HostFirmwareSettings` CRs and retrieve managed clusters firmware settings.

For more information, see xref:../edge_computing/ztp-deploying-far-edge-sites.adoc#ztp-configuring-host-firmware-with-gitops-ztp_ztp-deploying-far-edge-sites[Managing host firmware settings with {ztp}].

[id="ocp-4-17-image-based-upgrade-enhancements_{context}"]
==== Image-based upgrade enhancements

With this release, the image-based upgrade introduces the following enhancements:

* Simplifies the upgrade process for a large group of managed clusters by adding the `ImageBasedGroupUpgrade` API on the hub
* Labels the managed clusters for action completion when using the `ImageBasedGroupUpgrade` API
* Improves seed cluster validation before the seed image generation
* Automatically cleans up the container storage disk if usage reaches a certain threshold on the managed clusters
* Adds comprehensive event history in the new `status.history` field of the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR

For more information about the `ImageBasedGroupUpgrade` API, see xref:../edge_computing/image_based_upgrade/ztp-image-based-upgrade.adoc#ztp-image-based-upgrade-concept_ztp-gitops[Managing the image-based upgrade at scale using the ImageBasedGroupUpgrade CR on the hub].

* The Insights Operator now collects the `haproxy_exporter_server_threshold` metric. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-36687[*OCPBUGS-36687*])

* Previously, the Insights Operator gathered information about all Ingress Controller certificates, including their `NotBefore` and `NotAfter` dates. This data is now compiled into a `JSON` file located at `aggregated/ingress_controllers_certs.json` for easier monitoring of certificate validity across the cluster.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-35727[*OCPBUGS-35727*])

[id="ocp-4-17-etcd-certificates_{context}"]
=== Security

[id="ocp-17-auto-rotate-etcd-ca_{context}"]
==== Automatic rotation of signer certificates

With this release, all `etcd` certificates originate from a new namespace: `openshift-etcd`. When a new signer certificate is close to its expiration date, the following actions occur:

. An automatic rotation of the signer certificate activates.
. The certificate bundle updates.
. All certificates regenerate with the new signers.

Manual rotation of signer certificates is still supported by deleting the specific secret and waiting for the status pod rollout to complete.

[id="ocp-17-sigstore-verification_{context}"]
==== Sigstore signature image verification

With this release, Technology Preview clusters use Sigstore signatures to verify images that were retrieved using a pull spec that references the `quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release`repository.

Currently, if you are mirroring images, you must also mirror `quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:<release_image_digest_with_dash>.sig` Sigstore signatures in order for the image verification to succeed.

==== Builds

* Previously, builds could not set the `GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE` environment variable and use its value when cloning the source code. This caused builds to fail for some Git repositories with LFS files. With this release, the build is able to set this environment variable and use it during the `git clone` step of the build, which resolves the issue.

[id="ocp-4-17-cloud-compute-bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== Cloud Compute

* Previously, a machine controller failed to save the {vmw-full} task ID of an instance template clone operation. This caused the machine to go into the `Provisioning` state and to power off. With this release, the {vmw-full} machine controller can detect and recover from this state. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-1735[*OCPBUGS-1735*])

* Previously, the `machine-api` Operator reacted when it deleted a server that was in an `ERROR` state. This happened because the server did not pass a port list. With this release, deleting a machine stuck in an `ERROR` state does not cause an Operator reaction. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34155[*OCPBUGS-34155*])

* Previously, you could not configure capacity reservation on a {azure-first} Workload Identity cluster because of missing permissions. With this release, the `Microsoft.Compute/capacityReservationGroups/deploy/action` permission is added as a default credential request in the `<infra-name>-openshift-machine-api-azure-cloud-credentials` custom role, so that you can now configure capacity reservation as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-37154[*OCPBUGS-37154*])

* Previously, an optional internal function of the cluster autoscaler caused repeated log entries when it was not implemented. The issue is resolved in this release. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33932[*OCPBUGS-33932*])

* Previously, a node associated with a restarting machine briefly having a status of `Ready=Unknown` triggered the `UnavailableReplicas` condition in the Control Plane Machine Set Operator. This condition caused the Operator to enter the `Available=False` state and trigger alerts because that state indicates a nonfunctional component that requires immediate administrator intervention. This alert should not have been triggered for the brief and expected unavailabilty during a restart. With this release, a grace period for node unreadiness is added to avoid triggering unnecessary alerts. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-20061[*OCPBUGS-20061*])

* Previously, when an {product-title} cluster was installed with no capabilities and later enabled the Build capability, the related Build cluster configuration custom resource definition (CRD) was not created. With this release, the Build cluster configuration CRD and its default instance are created. This allows the Build capability to be fully configured and customized. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34395[*OCPBUGS-34395*])

* Previously, role bindings related to the Image Registry, Build, and `DeploymentConfig` capabilities were created in every namespace, even if the the capabilities were disabled. With this release, role bindings is only created if the capability is enabled on the cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34077[*OCPBUGS-34077*])

[id="ocp-4-17-cloud-cred-operator-bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== Cloud Credential Operator

* Previously, secrets in the cluster were fetched in a single call. When there was a large number of secrets, the API timed out. With this release, the Cloud Credential Operator fetches secrets in batches limited to 100 secrets. This change prevents timeouts when there is a large number of secrets in the cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-41233[*OCPBUGS-41233*])

* Previously, the Cloud Credential Operator reported an error when the `awsSTSIAMRoleARN` role was not present on a cluster that used manual mode with AWS Security Token Service. With this release, the Cloud Credential Operator no longer reports this as an error. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33566[*OCPBUGS-33566*])

* Previously, when checking whether passthrough permissions are sufficient, the Cloud Credential Operator sometimes received a response from the Google Cloud Platform API that a permission is invalid for a project. This response caused the Operator to become degraded and installation to fail. With this release, the Operator is updated to handle this error gracefully.

==== Developer Console

* Previously, on some browsers, some icons in the samples catalog were stretched, making it hard to read. With this update, the icons were resized correctly, and now the icons are no longer stretched and easier to read. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34516[*OCPBUGS-34516*])

* Previously, s2i build strategy was not explicitly mentioned in the `func.yml`. Therefore you could not create {ServerlessProductName} functions with the repository. Additionally, error messages were not available if s2i is not mentioned or if `func.yml`. As a result, identifying the reason of failures was not apparent. With this update, if the s2i build strategy is not mentioned, users can still create a function. If it is not s2i, users cannot create a function. The error messages are now different for both the cases. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33733[*OCPBUGS-33733*])

* Previously, when using a Quick Start guided tour in the {product-title} web console, it took multiple clicks of the *Next* button to skip to the next step if the `check your work` dialog was ignored. With this update, it only takes one click, regardless of the state of the `check your work` box. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-25929[*OCPBUGS-25929*])

[id="ocp-4-17-cloud-etcd-operator-bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== etcd Cluster Operator

* Previous versions of the etcd Operator checked the health of etcd members in serial with an all-member timeout that matched the single-member timeout. As a result, one slow member check could consume the entire timeout and cause later member checks to fail, regardless of the health of that later member. In this release, the etcd Operator checks the health of members in parallel, so the health and speed of one member's check does not affect the other members' checks.

[id="ocp-hosted-control-planes-bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== Hosted control planes

* Previously, when a hosted cluster proxy was configured and it used an identity provider (IDP) that had an HTTP or HTTPS endpoint, the hostname of the IDP was unresolved before sending it through the proxy. Consequently, hostnames that could only be resolved by the data plane failed to resolve for IDPs. With this update, a DNS lookup is performed before sending IPD traffic through the `konnectivity` tunnel. As a result, IDPs with hostnames that can only be resolved by the data plane can be verified by the Control Plane Operator. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-41371[*OCPBUGS-41371*])

* Previously, when the hosted cluster `controllerAvailabilityPolicy` was set to `SingleReplica`, `podAntiAffinity` on networking components blocked the availability of the components. With this release, the issue is resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-39313[*OCPBUGS-39313*])

* Previously, the `AdditionalTrustedCA` that was specified in the hosted cluster image configuration was not reconciled into the `openshift-config` namespace, as expected by the `image-registry-operator`, and the component did not become available. With this release, the issue is resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-39225[*OCPBUGS-39225*])

* Previously, Red{nbsp}Hat HyperShift periodic conformance jobs failed because of changes to the core operating system. These failed jobs caused the OpenShift API deployment to fail. With this release, an update recursively copies individual trusted certificate authority (CA) certificates instead of copying a single file, so that the periodic conformance jobs succeed and the OpenShift API runs as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-38941[*OCPBUGS-38941*])

* Previously, the Konnectivity proxy agent in a hosted cluster always sent all TCP traffic through an HTTP/S proxy. It also ignored host names in the `NO_PROXY` configuration because it only received resolved IP addresses in its traffic. As a consequence, traffic that was not meant to be proxied, such as LDAP traffic, was proxied regardless of configuration. With this release, proxying is completed at the source (control plane) and the Konnectivity agent proxying configuration is removed. As a result, traffic that is not meant to be proxied, such as LDAP traffic, is not proxied anymore. The `NO_PROXY` configuration that includes host names is honored. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-38637[*OCPBUGS-38637*])

* Previously, the `azure-disk-csi-driver-controller` image was not getting appropriate override values when using `registryOverride`. This was intentional so as to avoid propagating the values to the `azure-disk-csi-driver` data plane images. With this update, the issue is resolved by adding a separate image override value. As a result, the `azure-disk-csi-driver-controller` can be used with `registryOverride` and no longer affects `azure-disk-csi-driver` data plane images. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-38183[*OCPBUGS*])

* Previously, the AWS cloud controller manager within a hosted control plane that was running on a proxied management cluster would not use the proxy for cloud API communication. With this release, the issue is fixed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-37832[*OCPBUGS-37832*])

* Previously, proxying for Operators that run in the control plane of a hosted cluster was performed through proxy settings on the Konnectivity agent pod that runs in the data plane. It was not possible to distinguish if proxying was needed based on application protocol.
+
For parity with {product-title}, IDP communication via HTTPS or HTTP should be proxied, but LDAP communication should not be proxied. This type of proxying also ignores `NO_PROXY` entries that rely on host names because by the time traffic reaches the Konnectivity agent, only the destination IP address is available.
+
With this release, in hosted clusters, proxy is invoked in the control plane via `konnectivity-https-proxy` and `konnectivity-socks5-proxy`, and proxying traffic is stopped from the Konnectivity agent. As a result, traffic that is destined for LDAP servers is no longer proxied. Other HTTPS or HTTPS traffic is proxied correctly. The `NO_PROXY` setting is honored when you specify hostnames. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-37052[*OCPBUGS-37052*])

* Previously, proxying for IDP communication occurred in the Konnectivity agent. By the time traffic reached Konnectivity, its protocol and hostname were no longer available. As a consequence, proxying was not done correctly for the OAUTH server pod. It did not distinguish between protocols that require proxying (http/s) and protocols that do not (ldap://). In addition, it did not honor the `no_proxy` variable that is configured in the `HostedCluster.spec.configuration.proxy` spec.
+
With this release, you can configure the proxy on the Konnectivity sidecar of the OAUTH server so that traffic is routed appropriately, honoring your `no_proxy` settings. As a result, the OAUTH server can communicate properly with identity providers when a proxy is configured for the hosted cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-36932[*OCPBUGS-36932*])

* Previously, the HostedClusterConfig Operator (HCCO) did not delete the `ImageDigestMirrorSet` CR (IDMS) after you removed the `ImageContentSources` field from the `HostedCluster` object. As a consequence, the IDMS persisted in the `HostedCluster` object when it should not. With this release, the HCCO manages the deletion of IDMS resources from the `HostedCluster` object. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34820[*OCPBUGS-34820*])

* Previously, deploying a `hostedCluster` in a disconnected environment required setting the `hypershift.openshift.io/control-plane-operator-image` annotation. With this update, the annotation is no longer needed. Additionally, the metadata inspector works as expected during the hosted Operator reconciliation, and `OverrideImages` is populated as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34734[*OCPBUGS-34734*])

* Previously, hosted clusters on AWS leveraged their VPC's primary CIDR range to generate security group rules on the data plane. As a consequence, if you installed a hosted cluster into an AWS VPC with multiple CIDR ranges, the generated security group rules could be insufficient. With this update, security group rules are generated based on the provided machine CIDR range to resolve this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34274[*OCPBUGS-34274*])

* Previously, the OpenShift Cluster Manager container did not have the right TLS certificates. As a consequence, you could not use image streams in disconnected deployments. With this release, the TLS certificates are added as projected volumes to resolve this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31446[*OCPBUGS-31446*])

[id="ocp-4-17-image-registry-bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== Image Registry

* In {product-title} 4.14, installing a cluster with {entra-first} was made generally available. With this feature, administrators can configure a Microsoft Azure cluster to use {entra-short}. With {entra-short}, cluster components use temporary security credentials that are managed outside of the cluster.
+
Previously, when {product-title} was deployed on Azure clusters with {entra-short}, storage accounts created for the cluster and the image registry had *Storage Account Key Access* enabled by default, which could pose security risks to the deployment.
+
With this update, shared access keys are disabled by default on new installations that use {entra-short}, enhancing security by preventing the use of shared access keys.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Shared access keys should only be disabled if the cluster is configured to use {entra-short}. Disabling shared access keys on a cluster not configured with {entra-first} can cause the Image Registry Operator to become degraded.
====
+
For existing storage accounts created before this update, shared access keys are not automatically disabled. Administrators must manually disable shared access key support on these storage accounts to prevent the use of shared keys. For more information about disabling shared access keys, see link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/shared-key-authorization-prevent?tabs=portal[Prevent Shared Key authorization for an Azure Storage account].

[id="ocp-4-17-installer-bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== Installer

* Previously, when installing a cluster on {ibm-cloud-name} into an existing VPC, the installation program retrieved an unsupported VPC region. Attempting to install into a supported VPC region that follows the unsupported VPC region alphabetically caused the installation program to crash. With this release, the installation program is updated to ignore any VPC regions that are not fully available during resource lookups. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-14963[*OCPBUGS-14963*])

* Previously, the installation program attempted to download the OVA on {vmw-first} whether the template field was defined or not. With this update, the issue is resolved. The installation program verifies if the template field is defined. If the template field is not defined, the OVA is downloaded. If the template field is defined, the OVA is not downloaded. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-39240[*OCPBUGS-39240*])

* Previously, enabling custom feature gates sometimes caused installation on an AWS cluster to fail if the feature gate `ClusterAPIInstallAWS=true` was not enabled. With this release, the `ClusterAPIInstallAWS=true` feature gate is not required.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34708[*OCPBUGS-34708*])

* Previously, some processes could be left running if the installation program exited due to infrastructure provisioning failures. With this update, all installation-related processes are terminated when the installation program terminates. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-36378[*OCPBUGS-36378*])

* Previously, the installation program required permission to create and delete IAM roles when installing a cluster on {aws-short} even when an existing IAM role was provided. With this update, the installation program only requires these permissions when it is creating IAM roles. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-36390[*OCPBUGS-36390*])

* Previously, long cluster names were trimmed without warning the user. With this update, the installation program warns the user when trimming long cluster names. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33840[*OCPBUGS-33840*])

* Previously, the `openshift-install` CLI sometimes failed to connect to the bootstrap node when collecting bootstrap gather logs. The installation program reported an error message such as `The bootstrap machine did not execute the release-image.service systemd unit`. With this release and after the bootstrap gather logs issue occurs, the installation program now reports `Invalid log bundle or the bootstrap machine could not be reached and bootstrap logs were not collected`, which is a more accurate error message. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34953[*OCPBUGS-34953*])

* Previously, when installing a cluster on {aws-short}, subnets that the installation program created were incorrectly tagged with the `kubernetes.io/cluster/<clusterID>: shared` tag. With this update, these subnets are correctly tagged with the `kubernetes.io/cluster/<clusterID>: owned` tag. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-36904[*OCPBUGS-36904*])

* Previously, the local etcd data store that is saved during installation was not deleted if the installation failed, consuming extra space on the installation host. With this update, the data store is deleted if infrastructure provisioning failures prevent a successful installation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-36284[*OCPBUGS-36284*])

* Previously, when a folder was undefined and the data center was located in a data center folder, an wrong folder structure was created starting from the root of the vCenter server. By using the Govmomi `DatacenterFolders.VmFolder`, it used the a wrong path. With this release, the folder structure uses the data center inventory path and joins it with the virtual machine (VM) and cluster ID value, and the issue is resolved.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-38616[*OCPBUGS-38616*])

* Previously, when templates are defined for each failure domain, the installation program required an external connection to download the OVA in {vmw-full}. With this release, the issue is resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-39239[*OCPBUGS-39239*])

* Previously, installing a cluster with a DHCP network on Nutanix caused a failure. With this release, this issue is resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-38934[*OCPBUGS-38934*])

* Previously, due to an EFI Secure Boot failure in the SCOS, when the FCOS pivoted to the SCOS the virtual machine (VM) failed to boot. With this release, the Secure Boot is disabled only when the Secure Boot is enabled in the `coreos.ovf` configuration file, and the issue is resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-37736[*OCPBUGS-37736*])

* Previously, if you specified an unsupported architecture in the `install-config.yaml` file the installation program would fail with a `connection refused` message. With this update, the installation program correctly validates the cluster architecture parameter, leading to successful installations. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-38841[*OCPBUGS-38841*])

* Previously, a rare condition om {vmw-full} Cluster API machines caused the vCenter session management to time out unexpectedly. With this release, the Keep Alive support is disabled in the current and later versions of CAPV, and the issue is resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-38677[*OCPBUGS-38677*])

* Previously, the installation program on {aws-first} used multiple IPv4 public IP addresses that Amazon has started charging for. With this release, support is provided for bring your own (BYO) public IPv4 pools in {product-title} so that users have control of IP addresses that are used by their services. Where the BYO public IPv4 pools feature is enabled, two new permissions, `ec2:DescribePublicIpv4Pools` and `ec2:DisassociateAddress`, are required, and the issue is resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-35504[*OCPBUGS-35504*])

* Previously, when users provided public subnets while using existing subnets and creating a private cluster, the installation program occasionally exposed on the public internet the load balancers that were created in public subnets. This invalidated the reason for a private cluster. With this release, the issue is resolved by displaying a warning during a private installation that providing public subnets might break the private clusters and, to prevent this, users must fix their inputs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-38963[*OCPBUGS-38963*])

* Previously, during installation the `oc adm node-image create` command used the kube-system/cluster-config-v1 resource to determine the platform type. With this release, the installation program uses the infrastructure resource, which provides more accurate information about the platform type. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-39092[*OCPBUGS-39092*])

* Previously, the `oc adm node-image create` command failed when run against a cluster in a restricted environment with a proxy because the command ignored the cluster-wide proxy setting. With this release, when the command is run it checks the cluster proxy resource settings, where available, to ensure the command is run successfully and the issue is resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-39090[*OCPBUGS-39090*])

* Previously, when installing a cluster with the Agent-based installer, the assisted-installer process could timeout when attempting to add control plane nodes to the cluster. With this update, the assisted-installer process loads fresh data from the assisted-service process, preventing the timeout. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-36779[*OCPBUGS-36779*])

* Previously, when the {vmw-full} vCenter cluster contained an ESXi host that did not have a standard port group defined and the installation program tried to select that host to import the OVA, the import failed and the error “Invalid Configuration for device '0'” was presented.
With this release, the installation program verifies whether a standard port group for an ESXi host is defined and, if not, continues until it locates an ESXi host with a defined standard port group or presents an error message if it fails to locate one, resolving the issue.
 (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-38560[*OCPBUGS-38560*])

* Previously, extracting the IP address from the Cluster API Machine object only returned a single IP address. On {vmw-first}, the returned address would always be an IPv6 address and this caused issues with the `must-gather` implementation if the address was non-routable. With this release, the Cluster API Machine object returns all IP addresses, including IPv4, so that the `must-gather` issue no longer occurs on {vmw-full}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-37607[*OCPBUGS-37607*])

* Previously, when installing a cluster on {aws-short}, EKS messages could appear in the installation logs even when EKS was meant to be disabled. With this update, EKS log messages have been disabled. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-35752[*OCPBUGS-35752*])

* Previously, unexpected output would appear in the terminal when creating an installer-provisioned infrastructure cluster. With this release, the issue has been resolved and the unexpected output no longer shows. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-35547[*OCPBUGS-35547*])

* Previously, when installing a cluster on {aws-short} after deleting a cluster with the `./openshift-install destroy cluster` command, the installation would fail with an error stating that there might already be a running cluster. With this update, all leftover artifacts are removed when the cluster is destroyed, resulting in successful installations afterwards. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-35542[*OCPBUGS-35542*])

* Previously, when installing a cluster on {aws-short}, load balancer ingress rules were continuously revoked and re-authorized, causing unnecessary API calls and delays in cluster provisioning. With this update, load balancer ingress rules are no longer revoked during installation, reducing API traffic and installation delays. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-35440[*OCPBUGS-35440*])

* Previously, when setting `platform.openstack.controlPlanePort.network` without a `fixedIPs` value, the installation program would output a misleading error message about the network missing subnets. With this release, the installation program validates that the `install-config` field `controlPlanePort` has a valid subnet filter set because it is a required value. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-37104[*OCPBUGS-37104*])

* Previously, adding IPv6 support for user-provisioned installation platforms caused an issue with naming {rh-openstack-first} resources, especially when you run two user-provisioned installation clusters on the same {rh-openstack-first} platform. This happened because the two clusters share the same names for network, subnets, and router resources. With this release, all the resources names for a cluster remain unique for that cluster so no interfere occurs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33973[*OCPBUGS-33973*])

* Previously, when installing a cluster on {ibm-power-server-name} with installer-provisioned infrastructure, the installation could fail due to load balancer timeouts. With this update, the installation program waits for the load balancer to be available instead of timing out. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34869[*OCPBUGS-34869*])

* Previously, when using the Assisted Installer, using a password that contained the colon character (`:`) resulted in a failed installation. With this update, pull secrets containing a colon in the password do not cause the Assisted Installer to fail. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31727[*OCPBUGS-31727*])

* Previously, solid state drives (SSD) that used SATA hardware were identified as removable. The Assisted Installer for {product-title} reported that no eligible disks were found and the installation stopped. With this release, removable disks are eligible for installation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33404[*OCPBUGS-33404*])

* Previously, when installing a cluster on bare metal using installer provisioned infrastructure, the installation could time out if the network to the bootstrap virtual machine is slow. With this update, the timeout duration has been increased to cover a wider range of network performance scenarios. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-41500[*OCPBUGS-41500*])

* Previously, when installing a cluster on {ibm-power-server-name}, the installation program did not list the `e980` system type in the `madrid` region. With this update, the installation program correctly lists this region. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-38439[*OCPBUGS-38439*])

* Previously, after installing a {sno} cluster, the monitoring system could produce an alert that applied to clusters with multiple nodes. With this update, {sno} clusters only produce monitoring alerts that apply to {sno} clusters. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-35833[*OCPBUGS-35833*])

* Previously, when installing a cluster on {ibm-power-server-name}, the installation could fail due to a DHCP server network collision. With this update, the installation program selects a random number to generate the DHCP network to avoid collision. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33912[*OCPBUGS-33912*])

* Previously, the installation program used the Neutron API endpoint to tag security groups. This API does not support special characters, so some {rh-openstack-first} clusters failed to install on {rh-openstack}. With this release, the installation program uses an alternative endpoint to tag security groups so that the issue no longer persists. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-36913[*OCPBUGS-36913*])

* Previously, setting an invalid Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) for the `additionalNetworkIDs` parameter of a machine pool in your `install-config` configuration file could result in the installation program exiting from installing the cluster. With this release, the installation program checks the validity of the `additionalNetworkIDs` parameter before the program continuing with installing the cluster so that this issue no longer persists. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-35420[*OCPBUGS-35420*])

* Previously, for {ibm-power-server-name} installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters, if no network name existed for a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), the destroy code would skip deleting the DHCP resource.  With this release, a test now checks if a DHCP is in an `ERROR` state, so that the DHCP resource is deleted. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-35039[*OCPBUGS-35039*])

==== Machine Config Operator

* Previously, in a cluster that runs {product-title} 4.16 with the Telco RAN DU reference configuration, long duration `cyclictest` or `timerlat` tests could fail with maximum latencies detected above `20`us. This issue occured because the `psi` kernel command line argument was being set to `1` by default when cgroup v2 is enabled. With this release, the issue is fixed by setting `psi=0` in the kernel arguments when enabling cgroup v2. The `cyclictest` latency issue reported in link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34022[*OCPBUGS-34022*] is now also fixed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-37271[*OCPBUGS-37271*])

* Previously, if a cluster admin creates a new `MachineOSConfig` object that references a legacy pull secret, the canonicalized version of this secret that gets created is not updated whenever the original pull secret changes. With this release, the issue is resolved.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34079[*OCPBUGS-34079*])

* Previously, the `/etc/mco/internal-registry-pull-secret.json` secret was being managed by the Machine Config Operator (MCO). Due to a recent change, this secret rotates on an hourly basis. Whenever the MCO detected a change to this secret, it rolled the secret out to each node in the cluster, which resulted in disruptions. With this fix, a different internal mechanism processes changes to the internal registry pull secret to avoid rolling out repeated MachineConfig updates.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33913[*OCPBUGS-33913*])

* Previously, if you created more than one `MachineOSConfig` object that required a canonicalized secret, only the first object would build. With this fix, the build controller handles multiple `MachineOSBuilds` that use the same canonicalized secret. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33671[*OCPBUGS-33671*])

* Previously, if machine config pools (MCP) had a higher `maxUnavailable` value than the cluster's number of unavailable nodes, cordoned nodes were able to be erroneously selected as an update candidate. This fix adds a node readiness check in the node controller so that cordoned nodes are queued for an update. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33397[*OCPBUGS-33397*])

* Previously, nodes could be drained twice if the node was queued multiple times in the drain controller. This behaviour might have been due to increased activity on the node object by on-cluster layering functionality. With this fix, a node queued for drain only drains once. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33134[*OCPBUGS-33134*])

* Previously, a potential panic was seen in Machine Config Controller and Machine Build Controller objects if a de-reference accidentally deleted `MachineOSConfig/MachineOSBuild` to read the build status. The panic is controlled with additional error conditions to warn for allowed MachineOSConfig deletions. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33129[*OCPBUGS-33129*])

* Previously, after upgrading from {product-title} 4.1 or 4.2 to version 4.15, some machines could get stuck during provisioning and never became available. This was because the `machine-config-daemon-firstboot` service was failing due to an incompatible `machine-config-daemon` binary on those nodes. With this release, the correct `machine-config-daemon` binary is copied to nodes before booting. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-28974[*OCPBUGS-28974*])

* Previously, if you attempted to configure on-cluster {op-system-first} image layering on a non-{op-system} node, the node became degraded. With this fix, in this situation, an error message is produced in the node logs, but the node is not degraded. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-19537[*OCPBUGS-197537*])

With this release, logic was added to support {gcp-wid-short} and Federated Identity Operator installs, so now you are alerted when you are on a {gcp-short} cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-38591[*OCPBUGS-38591*])

* Previously, the version number text in the *Updates* graph on the *Cluster Settings* page appeared as black text on a dark background when using Firefox in dark mode. With this update, the text appears as white text. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-38427[*OCPBUGS-38427*])

* Previously, dynamic plugins using PatternFly 4 referenced variables that are not available in {product-title} 4.15 and later. This was causing contrast issues for {rh-rhacm-first} in dark mode. With this update, older chart styles are now available to support PatternFly 4 charts used by dynamic plugins. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-36816[*OCPBUGS-36816*])

* Previously, when the `Display Admission Webhook` warning implementation presented issues with some incorrect code. With this update, the unnecessary warning message has been removed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-35940[*OCPBUGS-35940*])

* Previously, the global sync lock that applied to all HTTP servers spawned goroutines with a sync lock that is specific to each of the refresh tokens. With this release, the global refresh sync lock on a cluster with an external OIDC environment was replaced with a sync that refreshes for each token. As a result, refresh token performance is improved by 30% to 50%. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-35080[*OCPBUGS-35080*])

* Previously, a warning was not displayed for the `minAvailable` warning in `PodDisruptionBudget` create and edit form. With this update, code logic for displaying the `minAvailable` warning was added, and the `minAvailable` warning is displayed if violated. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34937[*OCPBUGS-34937*])

* Previously, the *OperandDetails* page displayed information for the first CRD that matched by name. After this fix, the *OperandDetails* page displays information for the CRD that matches by name and the version of the operand. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34901[*OCPBUGS-34901*])

* Previously, one inactive or idle browser tab caused session expiration for all other tabs. With this change, activity in any tab will prevent session expiration even if there is one inactive or idle browser tab. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34387[*OCPBUGS-34387*])

* Previously, the `Display Admission Webhook` warning implementation presented issues with some incorrect code. With this release, the unnecessary warning message has been removed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-35940[*OCPBUGS-34316*])

* Previously, text areas were not resizable. With this update, you are now able to resize text areas. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34200[*OCPBUGS-34200*])

* Previously, the Console Operator was not able to tolerate the absence of the ingress capability. With this update, the Console Operator configuration API has been enhanced with the possibility to add alternative ingress for the environments where the ingress cluster capability is disabled. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33787[OCPBUGS-33787*])

* Previously, the *Debug container* link was not displayed for pods with a `Completed` status. With this change, the link now appears. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33631[*OCPBUGS-33631*])

* Previously, the {product-title} web console did not show `filesystem` metrics on the *Nodes list* page due to incorrect Prometheus query. With this update, `filesystem` metrics are correctly displayed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33136[*OCPBUGS-33136*])

* Previously, pseudolocalization was not working due to a configuration issue. After this fix, pseudolocalization works again. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-30218[*OCPBUGS-30218*])

* Previously, console pods would crash loop if the `--user-auth` flag was set to `disabled`. With this update, the console backend properly handles this value. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29510[*OCPBUGS-29510*])

* Previously, utilization cards displayed a `limit` that incorrectly implied a relationship between capacity and limits. With this update, the position of `limit` was changed and the wording updated. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-23332[*OCPBUGS-23332*])

* Previously, in some edge cases, the wrong resource could be fetched when using websockets to watch a namespaced resource without providing a namespace. With this update, a validation to the resource watch logic was added to prevent the websocket request and log an error under this condition. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-19855[*OCPBUGS-19855*])

* Previously, perspective switching was not properly handled. With this update, perspectives that are passed with URL search parameters or plugin route page extensions now correctly switch the perspective and retain the correct URL path.

* Previously, the `config-reloader` of Prometheus for user-defined projects would fail if unset environment variables were used in the `ServiceMonitor` configuration, which resulted in Prometheus pod failure. With this release, the reloader no longer fails when an unset environment variable is encountered. Instead, unset environment variables are left as they are, while set environment variables are expanded as usual. Any expansion errors, suppressed or otherwise, can be tracked through the `reloader_config_environment_variable_expansion_errors` variable.

[id="ocp-4-17-networking-bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== Networking

* Previously, the SR-IOV Network Operator was listing the `SriovNetworkNodePolicies` resources in random order. This caused the `sriov-device-plugin` pod to enter a continuous restart loop. With this release, the SR-IOV Network Operator lists policies in a deterministic order so that the `sriov-device-plugin` pod does not enter a continuous restart loop. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-36243[*OCPBUGS-36243*])

* Previously, an interface created inside a new pod would remain inactive and the Gratuitous Address Resolution Protocol (GARP) notification would be generated. The notification did not reach the cluster and this prevented ARP tables of other pods inside the cluster from updating the MAC address of the new pod. This situation caused cluster traffic to stall until ARP table entries expired. With this release, a GARP notification is now sent after the interface inside a pod is active so that the GARP notification reaches the cluster. As a result, surrounding pods can identify the new pod earlier than they could with the previous behavior. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-30549[*OCPBUGS-30549*])

* Previously, enabling FIPS for a cluster caused SR-IOV device plugin pods to fail. With this release, SR-IOV device plugin pods have FIPS enabled so that when you enable FIPS for the cluster, the pods do not fail. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-41131[*OCPBUGS-41131*])

* Previously, a race condition was generated after rebooting an {product-title} node that used a performance profile with a small number of reserved CPUs. This occurred because Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) virtual functions (VFs) shared the same MAC address and any pods that used the VFs would experience communication issues. With this release, an update to the SR-IOV Network Operator config daemon ensures that the Operator checks that no duplicate MAC addresses do not exist on VFs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33137[*OCPBUGS-33137*])

* Previously, if you deleted the `sriovOperatorConfig` custom resource (CR), you could not create a new `sriovOperatorConfig` CR. With this release, the Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) Network Operator removes validating webhooks when you delete the `sriovOperatorConfig` CR, so that you can create a new `sriovOperatorConfig` CR.   (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-37567[*OCPBUGS-37567*])

* Previously, when you switched your cluster to use a different load balancer, the Ingress Operator did not remove the values from the `classicLoadBalancer` and `networkLoadBalancer` parameters in the `IngressController` custom resource (CR) status. This situation caused the status of the CR to report wrong information from the `classicLoadBalancer` and `networkLoadBalancer` parameters. With this release, after you switch your cluster to use a different load balancer, the Ingress Operator removes values from these parameters so that the CR reports a more accurate and less confusing message status. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-38646[*OCPBUGS-38646*])

* Previously, no multicast packets reached their intended target nodes when a multicast sender and a multicast receiver existed on the same node. This happened because of an OVN-Kubernetes RPM package update. With this release, this regression is fixed in the OVN-Kubernetes RPM package, so that the issue no longer persists. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34778[*OCPBUGS-34778*])

* Previously, when you created a `LoadBalancer` service for the Ingress Operator, a log message was generated that stated the change was not effective. This log message should only trigger for a change to an `Infra` custom resource. With this release, this log message is no longer generated when you create a `LoadBalancer` service for the Ingress Operator. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-34413[*OCPBUGS-34413*])

* Previously, the `DNSNameResolver` controller sent DNS requests to CoreDNS pods for DNS names that had IP addresses with expired time-to-live (TTL) values. This caused a continuous generation of DNS requests and memory leak issues for those pods. With this release, the `DNSNameResolver` controller waits until it receives the updated list of IP addresses and TTL values for a DNS name before sending any more requests to the DNS name. As a result, the controller no longer generates erroneous requests and sends them to pods. CoreDNS pods can now respond to DNS requests in a timely manner and update the `DNSNameResolver` objects with the latest IP addresses and TTLs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33750[*OCPBUGS-33750*])

* Previously, when you used the `must-gather` tool, a Multus Container Network Interface (CNI) log file, `multus.log`, was stored in a node's file system. This situation caused the tool to generate unnecessary debug pods in a node. With this release, the Multus CNI no longer creates a `multus.log` file, and instead uses a CNI plugin pattern to inspect any logs for Multus DaemonSet pods in the `openshift-multus` namespace. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33959[*OCPBUGS-33959*])

* Previously, an alert for `OVNKubernetesNorthdInactive` would not fire in circumstances where it should fire. With this release, the issue is fixed so that the alert for `OVNKubernetesNorthdInactive` fires as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33758[*OCPBUGS-33758*])

* Previously, for all pods where the default route has been customized, a missing route for the Kubernetes-OVN masquerade address caused each pod to be unable to connect to itself through a service for which it acts as a backend. With this release, the missing route for Kubernetes-OVN masquerade address is added to pods so that the issue no longer occurs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-36865[*OCPBUGS-36865*])

* Previously, the `iptables-alerter` pod did not handle errors from the `crictl` command-line interface, which could cause the pod to incorrectly log events from `host-network` pods or cause pod restarts. With this release, the errors are handled correctly so that these issues no longer persist. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-37713[*OCPBUGS-37713*])

* Previously, if you created a hosted cluster by using a proxy for the purposes of making the cluster reach a control plane from a compute node, the compute node would be unavailable to the cluster. With this release, the proxy settings are updated for the node so that the node can use a proxy to successfully communicate with the control plane. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-37786[*OCPBUGS-37786*])

* Previously, when a cluster failed to install on an on-premise platform with a configured load balancer, the `LoadBalancer` service's `LoadBalancerReady` condition received the `SyncLoadBalancerFailed` status. The status generated the following message:
+
[source,text]
----
The kube-controller-manager logs might contain more details.
----
+
This message is wrong because the logs are stored in the `cloud-controller-manager` namespace of a project. With this release,  the `SyncLoadBalancerFailed` status now communicates the correct message: +
+
[source, text]
----
The cloud-controller-manager logs may contain more details.

(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31664[*OCPBUGS-31664*])

* Previously, you could not control log levels for the internal component that selects IP addresses for cluster nodes. With this release, you can now enable debug log levels so that you can either increase or decrease log levels on-demand. To adjust log levels, you must create a config map manifest file with a configuration similar to the following:
+
[source,yaml]

* Previously, the Ingress Operator could not successfully update the canary route because the Operator did not have permission to update `spec.host` or `spec.subdomain` fields on an existing route. With this release, the required permission is added to the cluster role for the Operator’s service account and the Ingress Operator can update the canary route. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-36465[*OCPBUGS-36465*])

* Previously, administrator privileges were required to run some networking containers, such as Keepalived, on supported on-premise platforms. With this release, these containers no longer require administrator privileges to run them on supported on-premise platforms. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-36175[*OCPBUGS-36175*])

* Previously, if your `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` (NNCP) custom resource (CR) is set to use the default spanning tree protocol (STP) implementation, the CR configuration file would show `stp.enabled: true`, but the {product-title} web console cleared the STP checkbox. With this release, the web console only clears the STEP checkbox after you define `stp.enabled: false` in the NNCP CR YAML file. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-36238[*OCPBUGS-36238*])

* Previously, the Ingress Controller status was incorrectly displayed as `Degraded=False` because of a migration time issue with the `CanaryRepetitiveFailures` condition. With this release, the Ingress Controller status is correctly marked as `Degraded=True` for the appropriate length of time that the `CanaryRepetitiveFailures` condition exists.

* Previously, the Container Runtime Config controller did not detect whether a mirror configuration was in use before adding the scope from a `ClusterImagePolicy` CR to the `/etc/containers/registries.d/sigstore-registries.yaml` file. As a consequence, image verification failed with a `Not looking for sigstore attachments` message. With this fix, images are pulled from the mirror registry as expected.

* Previously, because of a critical regression on RHEL 9.4 kernels earlier than `5.14.0-427.26.1.el9_4`, the `mglru` feature had memory management disabled. In this release, the regression issue is fixed so that the `mglru` feature is now enabled in {product-title} {product-version}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-35436[*OCPBUGS-35436*])

==== Node Tuning Operator (NTO)

* Previously, due to an internal bug, the Node Tuning Operator incorrectly computed CPU masks for interrupt and network-handling CPU affinity if a machine had more than 256 CPUs. This prevented proper CPU isolation on those machines and resulted in `systemd` unit failures. With this release, the Node Tuning Operator computes the masks correctly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-39164[*OCPBUGS-39164*])

* Previously, the Open vSwitch (OVS) pinning procedure set the CPU affinity of the main thread, but other CPU threads did not pick up this affinity if they had already been created. As a consequence, some OVS threads did not run on the correct CPU set, which might interfere with the performance of pods with a Quality of Service (QoS) class of `Guaranteed`. With this update, the OVS pinning procedure updates the affinity of all the OVS threads, ensuring that all OVS threads run on the correct CPU set.

==== Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

* Previously, clusters with many custom resources (CRs) experienced timeouts from the API server and stranded updates where the only workaround was to uninstall and then reinstall the stranded Operators. This occurred because OLM evaluated potential updates by using a dynamic client lister. With this fix, OLM uses a paging lister for custom resource definitions (CRDs) to avoid timeouts and stranded updates. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-41549[*OCPBUGS-47549*])

* Previously, catalog source pods could not recover from a cluster node failure when the `registryPoll` parameter was unset. With this fix, OLM updates its logic for checking for dead pods. As a result, catalog source pods now recover from node failures as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-39574[*OCPBUGS-39574*])

* Previously, if you tried to install a previously-deleted Operator after an {product-title} update, the installation might fail. This occurred because OLM could not find previously created bundle unpack jobs. With this fix, OLM correctly installs previously installed Operators. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32439[*OCPBUGS-32439*])

* Previously, when a new version of a custom resource definition (CRD) specified a new conversion strategy, this conversion strategy was expected to successfully convert resources. However, OLM cannot run the new conversion strategies for CRD validation without actually performing the update operation. With this release, OLM generates a warning message during the update process when CRD validations fail with the existing conversion strategy, and the new conversion strategy is specified in the new version of the CRD. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31522[*OCPBUGS-31522*])

* Previously, if the `spec.grpcPodConfig.securityContextConfig` field in `CatalogSource` objects was unset within namespaces with a `PodSecurityAdmission` (PSA) level value of `restricted`, the catalog pod would not pass PSA validation. With this release, the OLM Catalog Operator now configures the catalog pod with the `securityContexts` necessary to pass PSA validation.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29729[*OCPBUGS-29729*])

* Previously, the `catalogd-controller-manager` pod might not have been deployed to a node despite being in the scheduling queue, and the OLM Operator would fail to install. With this fix, CPU requests are reduced for the related resources, and the issue no longer occurs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29705[*OCPBUGS-29705*])

* Previously, the Catalog Operator sometimes attempted to connect to deleted catalog sources that were stored in the cache. With this fix, the Catalog Operator queries a client to list the catalog sources on a cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-8659[*OCPBUGS-8659*])

* Previously, the Secrets Store Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver on {hcp} clusters failed to mount secrets because of an issue when using the {hcp} command-line interface, `hcp`, to create OpenID Connect (OIDC) infrastructure on {aws-full}. With this release, the issue has been fixed so that the driver can now mount volumes. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18711[*OCPBUGS-18711*])

[id="ocp-4-17-known-issues_{context}"]
== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.9 and beyond!
* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])

* A known issue exists when deleting a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` (NAD) resource created by a `UserDefinedNetwork` resource. You must check to see if a pod is referencing the NAD before deleting the NAD. The pod should be deleted before the NAD. Failure to do so can leave pods in an unexpected state. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-39185[*OCPBUGS-39185*])

* The DNF package manager included in {op-system-first} images cannot be used at runtime, because DNF relies on additional packages to access entitled nodes in a cluster that are under a Red Hat subscription. As a workaround, use the `rpm-ostree` command instead. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-35247[*OCPBUGS-35247*])

* When installing a cluster on {azure-full}, the installation will fail if no `install-config.yaml` file is provided. If an `install-config.yaml` file is provided, and `controlPlane.platform` is present but `controlPlane.platform.azure` is not provided, the installation will fail. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42296[*OCPBUGS-42296*])
+
See xref:../installing/installing_azure/ipi/installing-azure-customizations.adoc#installation-azure-config-yaml_installing-azure-customizations[Sample customized install-config.yaml file for Azure] for a sample configuration file, or set a non-null parameter as in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
controlPlane:
  platform:
    azure: {}
----

* When installing multiple clusters on {azure-full}, running multiple installations simultaneously from the same installation host will result in only one of the clusters installing successfully. If you run the installations sequentially rather than simultaneously, you can install multiple clusters on {azure-short} from the same installation host. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42296[*OCPBUGS-42296*])

* When installing a cluster on {azure-full}, specifying the `Standard_M8-4ms` instance type results in an error due to that instance type specifying its memory in decimal format instead of integer format. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42241[*OCPBUGS-42241*])

* Due to a change in storage account naming in {product-title} {product-version}, the Azure File Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver now alphabetically matches storage account of the Image Registry Operator. With this change, there is a known issue where the Azure File CSI driver fails to mount all volumes when the image registry is configured as private. The mount failures occur because the CSI driver tries to use the storage account of the Image Registry Operator, which is not configured to allow connections from worker subnets.
+
As a temporary workaround, the image registry should not be configured as private when using the Azure File CSI driver. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future version of {product-title}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42308[*OCPBUGS-42308*])

* When installing a cluster on {azure-short}, the installation fails if a customer-managed encryption key is specified. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42349[*OCPBUGS-42349*])

* When an error occurs during mirroring Operators and additional images, the log message "Generating Catalog Source" might still appear, even if no files are generated. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42503[*OCPBUGS-42503*])

[id="ocp-telco-ran-4-17-known-issues_{context}"]

* When you run Cloud-native Network Functions (CNF) latency tests on an {product-title} cluster, the test can sometimes return results greater than the latency threshold for the test; for example, 20 microseconds for `cyclictest` testing. This results in a test failure.
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42328[*OCPBUGS-42328*])

[id="ocp-telco-core-4-17-known-issues_{context}"]

[id="ocp-storage-core-4-17-known-issues_{context}"]

* If the controller pod terminates while cloning, or taking or restoring a volume snapshot, is in progress, the Microsoft Azure File clone or snapshot persistent volume claims (PVCs) remain in the Pending state. To resolve this issue, delete any affected clone or snapshot PVCs, and then recreate those PVCs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-35977[*OCPBUGS-35977*])

[id="ocp-hosted-control-planes-4-17-known-issues_{context}"]

* Deploying a self-managed private hosted cluster on AWS fails because the `bootstrap-kubeconfig` file uses an incorrect KAS port. As a result, the AWS instances are provisioned, but cannot join the hosted cluster as nodes. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-31840[*OCPBUGS-31840*])

[id="ocp-4-17-asynchronous-errata-updates_{context}"]
== Asynchronous errata updates

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for {product-title} {product-version} are released as asynchronous errata through the Red{nbsp}Hat Network. All {product-title} {product-version} errata is https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[available on the Red Hat Customer Portal]. See the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} Life Cycle] for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account settings for Red{nbsp}Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications are enabled, users are notified through email whenever new errata relevant to their registered systems are released.

[NOTE]
====
Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming {product-title} entitlements for {product-title} errata notification emails to generate.
====

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of {product-title} {product-version}. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form {product-title} {product-version}.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any {product-title} release, always review the instructions on xref:../updating/updating_a_cluster/updating-cluster-web-console.adoc#updating-cluster-web-console[updating your cluster] properly.
