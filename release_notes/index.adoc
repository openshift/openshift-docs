[[release-versioning-policy]]
== Versioning Policy

{product-title} provides strict backwards compatibility guarantees for all
supported APIs, excluding alpha APIs (which may be changed without notice) and
beta APIs (which may occasionally be changed in a non-backwards compatible
manner).

The {product-title} version must match between master and node hosts, excluding
temporary mismatches during cluster upgrades. For example, in a 3.9 cluster, all
masters must be 3.9 and all nodes must be 3.9. However, {product-title} will
continue to support older `oc` clients against newer servers. For example, a 3.4
`oc` will work against 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5 servers.

Changes of APIs for non-security related reasons will involve, at minimum, two
minor releases (3.4 to 3.5 to 3.6, for example) to allow older `oc` to update.
Using new capabilities may require newer `oc`. A 3.2 server may have additional
capabilities that a 3.1 `oc` cannot use and a 3.2 `oc` may have additional
capabilities that are not supported by a 3.1 server.
