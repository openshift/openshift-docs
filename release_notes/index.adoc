[[release-versioning-policy]]
== Versioning Policy

{product-title} provides strict backwards compatibility guarantees for all
supported APIs (excluding alpha APIs, which may be changed without notice, and
beta APIs, which may occasionally be changed in a non-backwards compatible
manner). {product-title} will continue to support older clients against newer
servers. For example, a 3.1 client will work against 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2 servers.

Changes of APIs for non-security related reasons will involve, at minimum, two
minor releases (3.1 to 3.2 to 3.3, for example) to allow older clients to
update. Using new capabilities may require newer clients. A 3.2 server may have
additional capabilities that a 3.1 client cannot use and a 3.2 client may have
additional capabilities that are not supported by a 3.1 server.
