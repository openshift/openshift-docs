toc::[]

{product-title} provides strict backwards compatibility guarantees for all
supported APIs, excluding alpha APIs (which may be changed without notice) and
beta APIs (which may occasionally be changed in a non-backwards compatible
manner).

Red Hat did not publicly release {product-title} 4.0 and, instead, released
{product-title} 4.1 directly after version 3.11.

The {product-title} version must match between master and node hosts, excluding
temporary mismatches during cluster upgrades. For example, in a
{product-version} cluster, all masters must be {product-version} and all nodes
must be {product-version}. If you installed an earlier version of `oc`, you
cannot use it to complete all of the commands in {product-title}
{product-version}. You must download and install the new version of `oc`.

Changes of APIs for non-security related reasons will involve, at minimum, two
minor releases (3.4 to 3.5 to 3.6, for example) to allow older `oc` to update.
Using new capabilities may require newer `oc`. A 3.2 server may have additional
capabilities that a 3.1 `oc` cannot use and a 3.2 `oc` may have additional
capabilities that are not supported by a 3.1 server.
