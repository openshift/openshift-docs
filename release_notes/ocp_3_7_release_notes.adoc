[[ocp-37-about-this-release]]
== About This Release

Red Hat {product-title} version 3.7
(link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3188[RHSA-2017:3188]) is now
available. This release is based on
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/tag/v3.7.0-rc.0[OpenShift
Origin 3.7]. New features, changes, bug fixes, and known issues that pertain to
{product-title} 3.7 are included in this topic.

{product-title} 3.7 is supported on RHEL 7.3, 7.4.2, 7.5, and Atomic Host 7.4.2 and
newer with the latest packages from Extras, including Docker 1.12.

TLSV1.2 is the only supported security version in {product-title} version 3.4
and later. You must update if you are using TLSV1.0 or TLSV1.1.

For initial installations, see the
xref:../install_config/install/planning.adoc#install-config-install-planning[Installing
a Cluster] topics in the
xref:../install_config/index.adoc#install-config-index[Installation and
Configuration] documentation.

To upgrade to this release from a previous version, see the
xref:../upgrading/index.adoc#install-config-upgrading-index[Upgrading
a Cluster] topics in the
xref:../install_config/index.adoc#install-config-index[Installation and
Configuration] documentation.

[[ocp-37-new-features-and-enhancements]]
== New Features and Enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

[[ocp-37-container-orchestration]]
=== Container Orchestration

[[ocp-37-kubernetes-upstream]]
==== Kubernetes Upstream

Many core features Google announced in June for Kubernetes 1.7 were the result
of OpenShift engineering. Red Hat continues to influence the product in the
areas of storage, networking, resource management, authentication and
authorization, multi-tenancy, security, service deployments, templating, and
controller functionality.

[[ocp-37-crio]]
==== CRI-O (Technology Preview)

This feature is currently in xref:ocp-37-technology-preview[Technology Preview]
and not for production workloads. CRI-O with builds will not yet work.


CRI-O v1.0 is a lightweight, native Kubernetes container runtime interface. By
design, it provides only the runtime capabilities needed by the kubelet. CRI-O is
designed to be part of Kubernetes and evolve in lock-step with the platform.

CRI-O brings:

* A minimal and secure architecture.
* Excellent scale and performance.
* The ability to run any Open Container Initiative (OCI) or docker image.
* Familiar operational tooling and commands.

image::crio-3-7.png[CRI-O]

To install and run CRI-O alongside `docker`, set the following in the
`[OSEv3:vars]` section
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-ansible[Ansible inventory file] during cluster installation:

----
openshift_use_crio=true
----

This setting pulls the *openshift3/cri-o* system container image from the
link:https://access.redhat.com/containers[Red Hat Registry] by default. If you
want to use an alternative CRI-O system container image from another registry,
you can also override the default using the following variable:

----
openshift_crio_systemcontainer_image_override=<registry>/<repo>/<image>:<tag>
----

[NOTE]
====
The `atomic-openshift-node` service must be RPM- or system container-based when
using CRI-O; it cannot be `docker` container-based. The installer protects again
using CRI-O with `docker` container nodes and will halt installation if
detected.
====

When CRI-O use is enabled, it is installed alongside `docker`, which currently
is required to perform build and push operations to the registry. Over time,
temporary `docker` builds can accumulate on nodes. You can optionally set the
following to enable garbage collection, which adds a daemonset to clean out the
builds:

----
openshift_crio_enable_docker_gc=true
----

When enabled, it will run garbage collection on all nodes by default. You can
also limit the running of the daemonset on specific nodes by setting the
following:

----
openshift_crio_docker_gc_node_selector={'runtime': 'cri-o'}
----

For example, the above would ensure it is only run on nodes with the `runtime:
cri-o` label. This can be helpful if you are running CRI-O only on some nodes,
and others are only running `docker`.

See the link:http://cri-o.io/[upstream documentation] for more information on
CRI-O.

[[ocp-37-cluster-wide-tolerations-per-namespace-tolerations]]
==== Cluster-wide Tolerations and Per-namespace Tolerations to Control Pod Placement

In a multi-tenant environment, you want to leverage administration controllers
to help define rules that can help govern a cluster, should a tenant not set a
toleration for placement.

The following is offered to administrators where the namespace setting will
override the cluster setting:

* Cluster-wide and per-namespace default toleration for pods.
* Cluster-wide and per-namespace white-listing of toleration for pods.

.Cluster-wide Off Example
----
admissionConfig:
  pluginConfig:
    PodTolerationRestriction:
      configuration:
        kind: DefaultAdmissionConfig
        apiVersion: v1
        disable: true
----

.Cluster-wide On Example
----

[[ocp-37-security]]
=== Security

[[ocp-37-documented-private-public-key-configurations-and-crypto-levels]]
==== Documented Private and Public Key Configurations and Crypto Levels

While {product-title} is a secured by default implementation of Kubernetes,
there is now documentation on what security protocols and ciphers are used.

{product-title} leverages Transport Layer Security (TLS) cipher suites, JSON Web
Algorithms (JWA) crypto algorithms, and offers external libraries such as The
Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSSAPI) and libgpgme.

xref:../architecture/index.adoc#architecture-index[Private and public key
configurations and Crypto levels] are now documented for {product-title}.

[[ocp-37-node-authorizer-node-restriction-admission-plug-in]]
==== Node Authorizer and Node Restriction Admission Plug-in

Pods can no longer try to gain information from secrets, configuration maps, PV,
PVC, or API objects from other nodes.

link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/node/[Node authorizer]
governs what APIs a kubelet can perform. Spanning read-, write-, and auth-related
operations. In order for the admission controller to know the identity of the
node to enforce the rules, nodes are provisioned with credentials that identify
them with the user name `system:node:<nodename>` and group `system:nodes`.

These enforcements are in place by default on all new installations of
{product-title} 3.7.  For upgrades from {product-title} 3.6, they are not in
place due to the `system:nodes` RBAC being granted from OCP 3.6. To turn the
enforcements on, run:

----
# oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-group system:node system:nodes
----

[[ocp-37-advanced-auditing]]
==== Advanced Auditing

With Advanced Auditing, administrators are now exposed to more information from
the API call within the audit trail. This provides a deeper traceability of what
is occurring across the cluster.  We also capture all login events at the
default logging level and modifications to role binds and SCC.

{product-title} now has an audit `policyFile` or `policyConfiguration` where
administrators can filter in on what they want to capture.

See
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-node-config-advanced-audit[Advanced
Audit] for more information.

[[ocp-37-complete-upstreaming-of-rbac-then-downstreaming]]
==== Complete Upstreaming of RBAC, Then Downstreaming it Back into OpenShift

The rolebinding and RBAC experience is now the same across all Kubernetes
distributions.

Administrators do not have to do anything for this migration to occur. The
upgrade process to {product-title} 3.7 offers a seamless experience. Now, the
user experience is consistent with upstream.

A role can be defined within a namespace with a `Role`, or cluster-wide with a
`ClusterRole`.

A `RoleBinding` or `ClusterRoleBinding` binds a role to subjects. Subjects can
be groups, users, or service accounts. A role binding grants the permissions
defined in a role.

[[ocp-37-longer-lived-api-tokens-to-oauth-clients]]
==== Issue Longer-lived API Tokens to OAuth Clients

Administrators now have the ability to set different token timeouts for the
different ways users connect to {product-title} (for example, via the `oc` command
line, from a GitHub authentication, or from the web console).

Administrators can edit `oauthclients` and set the `accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds` to
a time value in seconds that meets their needs.

There are three possible OAuth client types:

. `openshift-web-console` -  The client used to request tokens for the OpenShift web console.

. `openshift-browser-client` - The client used to request tokens at
*_/oauth/token/request_* with a user-agent that can handle interactive logins,
such as using Auth from GitHub, Google Authenticator, and so on.

. `openshift-challenging-client` - The client used to request tokens with a user-agent that can
   handle WWW-Authenticate challenges, such as the `oc` command line.

- When `accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds` is set to `0`, tokens do not expire.
- When left blank, {product-title} uses the definition in `master-config`.
- Edit the client of interest via:
+
----
# oc edit oauthclients openshift-browser-client
----

- Set `accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds` to `600`.
- Check the setting via:
+
----
# oc get oauthaccesstoken
----

See
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/other_api_objects.adoc#accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds[Other
API Objects] for more information.

[[ocp-37-scc-now-supports-flexvolume]]
==== Security Context Constraints Now Supports flexVolume

flexVolumes allow users to integrate with new APIs easily by being able to mount
in the items needed for integration. For example, the ability to bind mount in
certain files without overwriting whole directories to integrate with Kerberos.

Administrators are now able to grant access to users to use specific flexVolume
driver names. Previously, the only way administrators could restrict flexVolumes
was by setting them as `on` or `off`.

[[ocp-37-storage]]
=== Storage

[[ocp-37-local-persistent-volumes]]
==== Local Storage Persistent Volumes (Technology Preview)

Local storage persistent volumes is a feature currently in
xref:ocp-37-technology-preview[Technology Preview] and not for production
workloads.

Local persistent volumes (PVs) now offer the ability to allow tenants to request
storage that is local to a node through the regular persistent volume claim
(PVC) process without needing to know the node.  Local storage is commonly used
in data store applications.

The administrator needs to create the local storage on the nodes, mount them
under directories, and then manually create the persistent volume (PV).
Alternatively, they can use an external provisioner and feed it the node
configuration via `configMaps`.

Example persistent volume named `example-local-pv` that some tenants can now claim:

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: example-local-pv
  annotations:
    "volume.alpha.kubernetes.io/node-affinity": '{
      "requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution": {
        "nodeSelectorTerms": [
          { "matchExpressions": [
            { "key": "kubernetes.io/hostname",
              "operator": "In",
              "values": ["my-node"]
            }
          ]}
         ]}
        }'
spec:

    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:

----

See
xref:../install_config/configuring_local.adoc#install-config-configuring-local[Configuring
for Local Volume] and
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_local.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-local[Persistent
Storage Using Local Volume] for more information.

[[ocp-37-tenant-driven-storage-snapshotting]]
==== Tenant-driven Storage Snapshotting (Technology Preview)

Tenant-driven storage snapshotting is currently in
xref:ocp-37-technology-preview[Technology Preview] and not for production
workloads.

Tenants now have the ability to leverage the underlying storage technology
backing the persistent volume (PV) assigned to them to make a snapshot of their
application data. Tenants can also now restore a given snapshot from the past to
their current application.

An external provisioner is used to access the EBS, GCE pDisk, and HostPath, and
Cinder snapshotting API. This Technology Preview feature has tested EBS and
HostPath. The tenant must stop the pods and start them manually.

. The administrator runs an external provisioner for the cluster. These are images
from the Red hat Container Catalog.

. The tenant made a PVC and owns a PV from one of the supported storage
solutions.The administrator must create a new `StorageClass` in the cluster with:
+
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: snapshot-promoter
provisioner: volumesnapshot.external-storage.k8s.io/snapshot-promoter
----

. The tenant can create a snapshot of a PVC named `gce-pvc` and the resulting
snapshot will be called `snapshot-demo`.
+
----
$ oc create -f snapshot.yaml

apiVersion: volumesnapshot.external-storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshot
metadata:
  name: snapshot-demo
  namespace: myns
spec:
  persistentVolumeClaimName: gce-pvc
----

. Now, they can restore their pod to that snapshot.
+
----
$ oc create -f restore.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: snapshot-pv-provisioning-demo
  annotations:
    snapshot.alpha.kubernetes.io/snapshot: snapshot-demo
spec:
  storageClassName: snapshot-promoter
----

[[ocp-37-storage-classes-get-zones]]
==== Storage Classes Get Zones

Public clouds are particular about not allowing storage to cross zones or
regions, so tenants need an ability at times to specify a particular zone.

In {product-title} 3.7, administrators can now leverage a zone's definition
within the `StorageClass`:

----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: slow
provisioner: kubernetes.io/<provisioner>
parameters:
  type: pd-standard
  zones: zone1,zone2
----

See
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-dynamically-provisioning-pvs[Dynamic
Provisioning and Creating Storage Classes] for more information.

[[ocp-37-increased-volume-density]]
==== Increased Persistent Volume Density Support by CNS

Container-native storage (CNS) on {product-title} 3.7 now supports much higher
persistent volume density (three times more) to support a large number of
applications at scale. This is due to the introduction of brick-multiplexing
support in GlusterFS.

Over 1,000 volumes in a 3-node cluster with 32 GB of RAM per node available to
GlusterFS has been successfully tested. Also, 300 Block PVs are supported now on
3-node CNS.

[[ocp-37-cns-multi-protocol-support]]
==== CNS Multi-protocol (File, Block, and S3) Support for OpenShift

Container-native storage (CNS) is now extended support iSCSI and S3 back end for
{product-title}. Heketi is enhanced to support persistent volume (PV) expansion,
volume option, and HA.

Block device-based RWO implementation is added to CNS to improve the performance
of ElasticSearch, PostgreSQL, and so on. With {product-title} 3.7, Elastic and
Cassandra are fully supported.

[[ocp-37-cns-full-support-infrastructure-services]]
==== CNS Full Support for Infrastructure Services

Container-native storage (CNS) now fully supports all {product-title}
infrastructure services: registry, logging, and metrics.

{product-title} logging (with Elasticsearch) and {product-title} metrics (with
Cassandra) are fully supported on persistent volumes backed by CNS/CRS iSCSI
block storage.

The {product-title} registry is hosted on CNS/CRS by RWX persistent volumes,
providing high availability and redundancy through Gluster architecture.

Logging and metrics were tested at scale with 1000+ pods.

[[cop-37-automated-cns-deployment-with-openshift-advanced-installation]]
==== Automated Container Native Storage Deployment with OpenShift Advanced Installation

{product-title} 3.7 now includes an integrated and simplified installation of
container-native storage (CNS) through the advanced installer. The advanced
installer is enhanced for automated and integrated support for deployment of CNS
including block provisioner, S3 provisioner, and files for correctly configured
out-of-the-box {product-title} and CNS. The CNS storage device details are added
to the installer’s inventory file. The installer manages configuration and
deployment of CNS, its dynamic provisioners, and other pertinent details.

[[ocp-37-flexvolume-support-for-non-storage-use-cases]]
==== Official FlexVolume Support for Non-storage Use Cases

There is now a supported interface to allow you to bind and mount in content
from a running pod. FlexVolume is a script interface that runs on the kubelet and
offers five main functions to help you mount in content such as device drivers,
secrets, and certificates as bind mounts to the container from the host:

* `init` - Initialize the volume driver.
* `attach` - Attach the volume to the host.
* `mount` - Mount the volume on the host. This is the part that makes the volume available
to the host to mount it in *_/var/lib/kubelet_*.
* `unmount` - Unmount the volume.
* `detach` - Detach the volume from the host.

[[ocp-37-scale]]
=== Scale

[[ocp-37-scale-cluster-limits]]
==== Cluster Limits

Updated guidance around
xref:../scaling_performance/cluster_limits.adoc#scaling-performance-cluster-limits[Cluster
Limits] for {product-title} 3.7 is now available.

[[ocp-37-scale-tuned-profile-hierarchy]]
==== Updated Tuned Profile Hierarchy

The xref:../scaling_performance/host_practices.adoc#scaling-performance-capacity-tuned-profile[Tuned Profile Hierarchy]
is updated as of 3.7.

[[ocp-37-scale-cluster-loader]]
==== Cluster Loader

Guidance regarding use of
xref:../scaling_performance/using_cluster_loader.adoc#scaling-performance-using-cluster-loader[Cluster
Loader] is now available with the release of {product-title} 3.7. Cluster Loader
is a tool that deploys large numbers of various objects to a cluster, which
creates user-defined cluster objects. Build, configure, and run Cluster Loader
to measure performance metrics of your {product-title} deployment at various
cluster states.

[[ocp-37-scale-benefits-of-using-the-overlay-graph-driver]]
==== Guidance on Overlay Graph Driver with SELinux

In {product-title} 3.7, guidance about the
xref:../scaling_performance/optimizing_storage.adoc#benefits-of-using-the-overlay-graph-driver[benefits
of using the Overlay Graph Driver with SELinux] is now available.

[[ocp-37-scale-providing-storage-to-an-etcd-node-using-pci-passthrough-with-openstack]]
==== Providing Storage to an etcd Node Using PCI Passthrough with OpenStack

Guidance on
xref:../scaling_performance/host_practices.adoc#providing-storage-to-an-etcd-node-using-pci-passthrough-with-openstack[Providing
Storage to an etcd Node Using PCI Passthrough with OpenStack] is now available.

[[ocp-37-networking]]
=== Networking

[[ocp-37-network-policy]]
==== Network Policy
Network Policy is now fully supported in {product-title} 3.7.

Network Policy is an optional plug-in specification of how selections of pods
are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints. It
provides fine-grained network namespace isolation using labels and port
specifications.

After installing the Network Policy plug-in, an annotation that flips the
namespace from `allow all traffic` to `deny all traffic` must first be set on
the namespace. At that point, `NetworkPolicies` can be created that define what
traffic to allow. The annotation is as follows:

----
$ oc annotate namespace ${ns} 'net.beta.kubernetes.io/network-policy={"ingress":{"isolation":"DefaultDeny"}}'
----

[NOTE]
====
The annotation is not needed when using the v1 API.
====

The allow-to-red policy specifies "all red pods in namespace `project-a` allow
traffic from any pods in any namespace." This does not apply to the red pod in
namespace `project-b` because `podSelector` only applies to the namespace in
which it was applied.

.Policy applied to project
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: allow-to-red
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      type: red
  ingress:
  - {}
----

See
xref:../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#admin-guide-manage-networking[Managing
Networking] for more information.

[[ocp-37-cluster-ip-range-more-flexible]]
==== Cluster IP Range Now More Flexible

Cluster IP ranges are now more flexible by allowing multiple subnets for hosts.
This provides the capability to allocate multiple, smaller IP address ranges for
the cluster. This makes it easier to migrate from one allocated IP range to
another.

There are multiple comma-delimited CIDRs in the configuration file. Each node is
allocated only a single subnet from within any of the available ranges. You can
not allocate different-sized host subnets, or use this to change the host subnet
size. The `clusterNetworkCIDRs` can be different sizes, but must be equal to or
larger than the host subnet size. It is not allowed to have some nodes use
subnets that are not part of the `clusterNetworkCIDRs`. Nodes can allocate
different-sized subnets by setting different `hostSubnetLength` values.

In regard to migration or edits, networks can be added to the list, CIDRs in the
list may be re-ordered, and a CIDR can be removed from the list when there are
no nodes that have an SDN allocation from that CIDR.

Example:

----
networkConfig:
  clusterNetworkCIDR: 10.128.0.0/24
  clusterNetworks:
  - cidr: 11.128.0.0/24
    hostSubnetLength: 6
  - cidr: 12.128.0.0/24
    hostSubnetLength: 6
  - cidr: 13.128.0.0/24
    hostSubnetLength: 4
  externalIPNetworkCIDRs:
  - 0.0.0.0/0
  hostSubnetLength: 6
----

[[ocp-37-routes-alloed-to-set-cookie-names-for-session-stickiness]]
==== Routes Allowed to Set Cookie Names for Session Stickiness

The HAProxy router can look for a cookie in a client request. Based on that
cookie name and value, always route requests that have that cookie to the same
pod instead of relying upon the client source IP, which can be obscured by an F5
doing load balancing.

A cookie with a unique name is used to handle session persistence.

. Set a per-route configuration to set the cookie name used for the session.
. Add an `env` to set a router-wide default.
. Ensure that the cookie is set and honored by the router to control access.

Example scenario:

. Set a default cookie name for the HAProxy router:
+
----
$ oc env dc/router ROUTER_COOKIE_NAME=default-cookie
----

. Log in as a normal user and create the project/pod/svc/route:
+
----
$ oc login user1
$ oc new-project project1
$ oc create -f https://example.com/myhttpd.json
$ oc create -f https://example.com/service_unsecure.json
$ oc expose service service-unsecure
----

. Access the route:
+
----
$ curl $route -v
----
+
The HTTP response will contain the cookie name. For example:
+
----
Set-Cookie: default_cookie=[a-z0-9]+
----

. Modify the cookie name using route annotation:
+
----
$ oc annotate route service-unsecure router.openshift.io/cookie_name="route-cookie"
----

. Re-access the route:
+
----
$ curl $route -v
----
+
The HTTP response will contain the new cookie name:
+
----
Set-Cookie: route-cookie=[a-z0-9]+
----

See
xref:../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#route-specific-annotations[Route-specific
Annotations] for more information.

[[ocp-37-hsts-policy-support]]
==== HSTS Policy Support

xref:../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#hsts[HTTP Strict Transport Security
(HSTS)] ensures all communication between the server and client is encrypted and
that all sent and received responses are delivered to and received from the
authenticated server.

An HSTS policy is provided to the client via an HTTPS header (HSTS headers over
HTTP are ignored) using an `haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header` annotation
to the route. When the Strict-Transport-Security response in the header is
received by a client, it observes the policy until it is updated by another
response from the host, or it times-out (`max-age=0`).

Example using reencrypt route:

. Create the pod/svc/route:
+
----
$ oc create -f https://example.com/test.yaml
----

. Set the Strict-Transport-Security header:
+
----
$ oc annotate route serving-cert haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header="max-age=300;includeSubDomains;preload"
----

. Access the route using `https`:
+
----
$ curl --head https://$route -k

   ...
   Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=300;includeSubDomains;preload
   ...
----

[[ocp-37-enabling-static-IPs-for-external-project-traffic]]
==== Enabling Static IPs for External Project Traffic (Technology Preview)

As a cluster administrator, you can assign specific, static IP addresses to
projects, so that traffic is externally easily recognizable. This is different
from the default egress router, which is used to send traffic to specific
destinations.

Recognizable IP traffic increases cluster security by ensuring the origin is
visible. Once enabled, all outgoing external connections from the specified
project will share the same, fixed source IP, meaning that any external
resources can recognize the traffic.

Unlike the egress router, this is subject to `EgressNetworkPolicy` firewall
rules.

See
xref:../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#enabling-static-ips-for-external-project-traffic[Managing
Networking] for more information.

[[ocp-37-master]]
=== Master

[[ocp-37-public-pull-url-provided-for-images]]
==== Public Pull URL Provided for Images

A public pull URL is provided for images versus being able to know the internal
in-cluster IP or DNS of the service.

A new API field for the image stream with the public URL of the image was added,
and a public URL is configured in the *_master-config.yaml_* file.  The web
console will understand this new field and generate the public pull
specifications automatically to users (so users can just copy and paste the pull
URL).

Example:

. Check the `internalRegistryHostname` setting in the *_master-config.yaml_* file:
+
----
  ...
  imagePolicyConfig:
    internalRegistryHostname: docker-registry.default.svc:5000
  ...
----

. Delete the `OPENSHIFT_DEFAULT_REGISTRY` variable in both:
+
----
/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master-api
/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master-controllers
----

. Start a build and check the push URL. It should push the new build image with
`internalRegistryHostname` to the `docker-registry`.

[[ocp-37-custom-resource-definitions]]
==== Custom Resource Definitions

A _resource_ is an endpoint in the Kubernetes API that stores a collection of
API objects of a certain kind (for example, pod objects). A _custom resource
definition_ is a built-in API that enables the ability to plug in your own
custom, managed object and application as if it were native to Kubernetes.
Therefore, you can leverage Kubernetes cluster management, RBAC and
authentication services,  PI services, CLI, security, and so on, without having
to know Kubernetes internals or modifying Kubernetes itself in any way.

Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) deprecates Third Party Resources in Kubernetes
1.7.

How it works:

. Define a CRD class (your custom objects) and register the new resource type.
This defines how it fits into the hierarchy and how it will be referenced from
the CLI and API.

. Define a function to create a custom client, which is aware of the new resource
schema.

. Once completed, it can be accessed from the CLI. However, in order to build
controllers or custom functionality, you need API access to the objects, and so
you need to build a set of CRUD functions (library) to access the objects and the event-driven listener for controllers.

. Create a client that:
+
* Connects to the Kubernetes cluster.
* Creates the new CRD (if it does not exist).
* Creates a new custom client.
* Creates a new test object using the client library.
* Creates a controller that listens to events associated with new resources.

See
xref:../admin_guide/custom_resource_definitions.adoc#admin-guide-custom-resources[Extending
the Kubernetes API with Custom Resources] for more information.

[[ocp-37-master-prometheuh-endpoint-coverage]]
==== Master Prometheus Endpoint Coverage

Prometheus endpoint logic was added to upstream components so that monitoring
and health indicators can be added around deployment configurations.

[[ocp-37-installation]]
=== Installation

[[ocp-37-migrate-etcd-before-upgrade]]
==== Migrate etcd Before OpenShift Container Platform 3.7 Upgrade
Starting in {product-title} 3.7, the use of the etcd3 v3 data model is required.

{product-title} gains performance improvements with the v3 data model. In order
to upgrade the data model, an embedded etcd configuration option in no longer
allowed. Embedded is not co-located and mainly used in single-master
deployments. Migration scripts will convert the v3 data model and allow you to
move an embedded etcd to an external etcd either on the same host or a different
host than the masters. In addition, there is a new scale up ability for etcd
clusters.

See
xref:../upgrading/migrating_embedded_etcd.adoc#install-config-upgrading-etcd-data-migration[Migrating
Embedded etcd to External etcd] for more information.

[[ocp-37-modular-installer]]
==== Modular Installer to Allow Playbooks to Run Independently

The installer has been enhanced to allow administrators to install specific
components. By breaking up the roles and playbooks, there is better targeting of
ad hoc administration tasks.

[[new-install-experience-around-phases]]
==== New Installation Experience Around Phases
When you run the installer, {product-title} now reports back at the end what
phases you have gone through.

If the installation fails during a phase, you will be notified on the screen
along with the errors from the Ansible run. Once you resolve the issue, rather
than run the entire installation over again, you can pick up from the failed
phase. This results in an increased level of control during installations and
results in time savings.

[[ocp-37-increased-control-over-image-stream-templates]]
==== Increased Control Over Image Stream and Templates
With {product-title} 3.7, there is added control over whether or not your cluster
automatically upgrades all the content provided during cluster upgrades.

Edit the `openshift_install_examples` variable in the hosted file or set it as a variable in the installer.

----
RPM = /etc/origin/examples /etc/origin/hosted
Container = /usr/share/openshift/examples /usr/share/openshift/hosted

openshift_install_examples=false
----

Setting `openshift_install_examples` to `false` will cause the installer to not
upgrade the imagestream and templates. `True` is the default behavior.

[[ocp-37-install-config-cfme-from-ocp-installer]]
==== Installation and Configuration of CFME 4.6 from the OpenShift Installer

Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine (CFME) 4.6 is now fully supported running
on {product-title} 3.7 as a set of containers.

[IMPORTANT]
====
CFME 4.6 is not yet released. Until it is available, this role is limited to
installing ManageIQ (MIQ), the open source project that CFME is based on. The
following is provided mainly for informational purposes. The {product-title} 3.7
documentation will be updated with more complete instructions on deploying CFME
4.6 after it has been released.
====

CFME is an available API endpoint on all {product-title} clusters that choose to
use it. More cluster administrators are now able to leverage CFME and begin
experiencing the insight and automations available to them in {product-title}.

To install CFME 4.6:

----
# ansible-playbook -v -i <YOUR_INVENTORY> \
    playbooks/byo/openshift-management/config.yml
----

[NOTE]
====
There is a link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1506951[known issue] with this playbook.
====

To configure CFME 4.6 to consume the {product-title} installation it is running on:

----
# ansible-playbook -v -i <YOUR_INVENTORY> \
    playbooks/byo/openshift-management/add_container_provider.yml
----

You can also automate the configuration of the provider to point to multiple OpenShift clusters:

----
# ansible-playbook -v -e container_providers_config=/tmp/cp.yml \
    playbooks/byo/openshift-management/add_many_container_providers.yml
----

[NOTE]
====
The *_/tmp/cp.yml_* file requires some manual configurations to create and use
it correctly.

// Commenting out this section till CFME merges
See Multiple Container Providers for more information.

[[ocp-37-diagnostics]]
=== Diagnostics

[[ocp-37-additional-health-checks]]
==== Additional Health Checks

More health checks are now available for administrators to run after
installations and upgrades. Administrators need the ability to run tests
periodically to help determine the health of the framework components within the
cluster. {product-title} 3.7 offers test functionality via Ansible playbooks
that can be run and output can be sent as file-based output.

----

$ ansible-playbook playbooks/byo/openshift-checks/adhoc.yml -e
openshift_checks=fluentd_config,logging_index_time,docker_storage
----

Alternatively, they are included in the health playbook:

----
$ ansible-playbook playbooks/byo/openshift-checks/health.yml

[[ocp-37-metrics-and-logging]]
=== Metrics and Logging

[[ocp-37-journald-system-logs]]
==== Journald for System Logs and JSON File for Container Logs

Docker log driver is set to `json-file` as the default for all nodes. Docker
`log-driver` can be set to `journald`, but there is no log rate throttling with
the journald driver. So, there is always a risk for denial-of-service attacks
from rogue containers.

Fluentd will automatically determine which log driver (`journald` or
`json-file`) the container runtime is using. Fluentd will now always read logs
from journald and also *_/var/log/containers_* (if `log-driver` is set to
`json-file`). Fluentd will no longer read from *_/var/log/messages_*.

See
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#install-config-aggregate-logging[Aggregating
Container Logs] for more information.

[[ocp-37-docker-events-and-api-calls-aggregated-to-efk-as-logs]]
==== Docker Events and API Calls Aggregated to EFK as Logs

Fluentd captures standard error and standard out from the running containers on
the node. With this change, fluentd collects all the errors and events coming
from the docker daemon running on the node and sends it to Elasticsearch (ES).

Enable this via the {product-title} installer:

----
openshift_logging_fluentd_audit_container_engine=true
----

The collected information is in operation indices of ES and only cluster
administrators have visual access. The event message includes action, pod name,
image name, and user time-stamp.

[[ocp-37-master-events-aggregated-to-efk-as-logs]]
==== Master Events are Aggregated to EFK as Logs

The *eventrouter* pod scrapes the events from kubernetes API and outputs to
*STDOUT*. The *fluentd* plug-in transforms the log message and sends it to
Elasticsearch (ES).

Enable `openshift_logging_install_eventrouter` by setting it to `true`. It is
off by default. *Eventrouter* is deployed to the default namespace. Collected
information is in operation indices of ES and only cluster administrators have
visual access.

See the
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin-aggregated-logging/blob/master/docs/proposals/kube_events_design_doc.md[design
documentation] for more information.

[[ocp-37-kibana-dashboards-for-ops-now-shareable]]
==== Kibana Dashboards for Operations Are Now Shareable

This allows {product-title} administrators the ability to share saved Kibana
searches, visualizations, and dashboards.

When `openshift_logging_elasticsearch_kibana_index_mode` is set to `shared_ops`, one
`admin` user can create queries and visualizations for other `admin` users.
Other users can not see those same queries and visualizations.

When `openshift_logging_elasticsearch_kibana_index_mode` is set to `unique`,
users can only see saved queries and visualizations they created. This is the
default behavior.

See
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#aggregate-logging-ansible-variables[Aggregating
Container Logs] for more information.

[[ocp-37-removed-es-copy-method]]
==== Removed ES_Copy Method for Sending Logs to External ES

`ES_Copy` was replaced with the *secure_formard* plug-in for fluentd to send
logs from fluentd to external fluentd (that can then ingest into ES). `ES_COPY`
is removed from the installer and the documentation.

When `openshift_installer` is run for logging to upgrade to 3.7, the installer
now checks for `ES_COPY` in the inventory and fails the upgrade with:

----
msg: The ES_COPY feature is no longer supported. Remove the variable from your inventory
----

See
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#fluentd-log-external-elasticsearch[Aggregating
Container Logs] for more information.

[[ocp-37-expose-es-as-a-route]]
==== Expose Elasticsearch as a Route

By default, Elasticsearch (ES) deployed with OpenShift aggregated logging is not
accessible from outside the logging cluster. This enables a route for external
access to ES for those tools that want to access its data.

You now have direct access to ES using only your OpenShift token and have the
ability to provide the external ES and ES Ops hostnames when creating the server
certificate (similar to Kibana). Ansible tasks now simplify route deployment.

[[ocp-37-removed-metrics-and-logging-deployers]]
==== Removed Metrics and Logging Deployers

The metrics and logging deployers bare now replaced with `playbook2image` for
`oc cluster up` so that `openshift-ansible` is used to install logging and
metrics:

----
$ oc cluster up --logging --metrics
----

Check metrics and pod status:

----
$ oc get pod -n openshift-infra
$ oc get pod -n logging
----

[[ocp-37-prometheus]]
==== Prometheus (Technology Preview)

{product-title} operators deploy Prometheus (currently in
xref:ocp-37-technology-preview[Technology Preview] and not for production
workloads) on a {product-title} cluster, collect Kubernetes and infrastructure
metrics, and get alerts. Operators can see and query metrics and alerts on the
Prometheus web dashboard, or bring their own Grafana and hook it up to
Prometheus.

See xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#openshift-prometheus[Prometheus
on OpenShift] for more information.

[[ocp-37-integrated-approach-to-adding-hosa]]
==== Integrated Approach to Adding Hawkular OpenShift Agent (Tecnhology Preview)

Hawkular OpenShift Agent (HOSA) remains in
xref:ocp-37-technology-preview[Technology Preview] and not for production
workloads. It is packaged and can now be installed with the
`openshift_metrics_install_hawkular_agent` option in the installer by setting it
to `true`.

See
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-ansible-variable[Enabling
Cluster Metrics] for more information.

[[ocp-37-developer-experience]]
=== Developer Experience

[[ocp-37-aws-service-broker]]
==== AWS Service Broker

Users can seamlessly configure, deploy, and scale AWS services like Amazon RDS,
Amazon Aurora, Amazon Athena, Amazon Route 53, and AWS Elastic Load Balancing
directly within the {product-title} console. For installation instructions, see
link:https://github.com/awslabs/aws-servicebroker/[AWS Service
Broker] and
link:https://github.com/awslabs/aws-servicebroker-documentation/blob/master/getting-started.md[Getting

[[ocp-37-template-instantation-api]]
==== Template Instantiation API

Clients can now easily invoke a server API instead of relying on client logic.

[[ocp-37-dev-experience-metrics]]
==== Metrics

{product-title} now includes:

* Prometheus metrics that show you the health of builds in the system (number
running, failing, failure reasons, and so on).

* Timing information on build objects themselves to show how long they spent in
various steps (not exposed as Prometheus metrics).

[[ocp-37-cli-plug-ins]]
==== CLI Plug-ins (Technology Preview)

CLI plug-ins are currently in xref:ocp-37-technology-preview[Technology Preview]
and not for production workloads.

Usually called _plug-ins_ or _binary extensions_, this feature allows you to
extend the default set of `oc` commands available and, therefore, allows you to
perform new tasks.

See xref:../cli_reference/extend_cli.adoc#cli-reference-extend-cli[Extending the
CLI] for information on how to install and write extensions for the CLI.

[[ocp-37-chaining-builds]]
==== Chaining Builds

In {product-title} 3.7,
xref:../dev_guide/builds/advanced_build_operations.html#dev-guide-chaining-builds[Chaining
Builds] is a better approach for producing runtime-only
application images, and fully replaces the Extended Builds feature.

Benefits of Chaining Builds include:

* Supported by both Docker and Source-to-Image (S2I) build strategies, as well as
combinations of the two, compared with S2i strategy only for Extended Builds.

* No need to create and manage a new assemble-runtime script.

* Easy to layer application components into any thin runtime-specific image.

* Can build the application artifacts image anywhere.

* Better separation of concerns between the step that produces the application
artifacts and the step that puts them into an application image.

[[ocp-37-web-console]]
=== Web Console

[[ocp-37-openshift-ansible-broker]]
==== OpenShift Ansible Broker

In {product-title} 3.7, Open Service Broker API is implemented, enabling users
to leverage Ansible for provisioning and managing services from the Service
Catalog. This is a standardized approach for delivering simple to complex
multi-container OpenShift services via Ansible. It works in conjunction with
Ansible Playbook Bundle (APB) for lightweight application definition. APBs can
be used to deliver and orchestrate on-platform services, but could also be used
to provision and orchestrate off-platform services (from cloud providers, IaaS,
and so on).

OpenShift Ansible Broker supports production workloads and multiple service
plans. There is now secure connectivity between Service Catalog and Service
Broker.

You can interact with the Service Catalog to provision and manage services while
the details of the broker remain largely hidden.

[[ocp-37-ansible-playbook-bundles]]
==== Ansible Playbook Bundles

Ansible Playbook Bundles (APBs) are short-lived, lightweight container image
consisting of:

* a simple directory structure with named action playbooks.
* metadata (required and optional parameters, as well as dependencies).
* an Ansible runtime environment.

Developer tooling is included, providing a guided approach to APB creation.
There is also support for the *_test_* playbook, allowing for functional testing
of the service.) Two new APBs are introduced for MariaDB (SCL) and  MySQL DB
(SCL).

When a user provisions an application from the Service Catalog, the Ansible
Service Broker will download the associated APB image from the registry and run
it.

Developing APBs can be done in one of two ways: Creating the APB container image
manually using standardized container creation tooling, or with APB tooling that
Red Hat will deliver, which provides a guided approach to creation.

[[ocp-37-openshift-template-broker]]
==== OpenShift Template Broker

The OpenShift Template Broker exposes templates through a Open Service Broker
API to the Service Catalog.

The Template Broker matches the lifecycles of `provision`, `deprovision`,
`bind`, and `unbind` with existing templates. No changes are required to
templates, unless you expose `bind`. Your application will get injected with
configuration details.

[[ocp-37-initial-experience]]
==== Initial Experience

{product-title} 3.7 provides a better initial user experience with the Service
Catalog. This includes:

* A task-focused interface
* Key call-outs
* Unified search
* Streamlined navigation

The new user interface is designed to really streamline the getting started
process, in addition to incorporating the new Service Catalog items. It shows
the existing content (for example, builder images and templates) as well as
catalog items (if the catalog is enabled).

[NOTE]
====
The new user experience can be enabled as a Technology Preview feature without
the Service Catalog to be active. A cluster with this user interface (UI)
would still be supported. Running the catalog UI without the Service Catalog
enabled will work, but access to templates without the catalog will require a
few extra steps.
====

[[ocp-37-search-catalog]]
==== Search Catalog

{product-title} 3.7 provides a simple way to quickly get what you want The new
Search Catalog user interface is designed to make it much easier to find items
in a number of ways, making it even faster to find the items you are wanting to
deploy.

[[ocp-37-add-from-catalog]]
==== Add from Catalog

Provision a service from the catalog. Select the desired service and follow
prompts for the desired project and configuration details.

image::3.7-add-to-project-wizard-animated.gif[add to project]

[[ocp-37-connect-a-service]]
==== Connect a Service
Once a service is deployed, get coordinates to connect the application to it.

The broker returns a secret, which is stored in the project for use. You are
guided through a process to update the deployment to inject a secret.

image::3.7-bind-mongodb-nodejs-at-creation.gif[connect a service]

[[ocp-37-include-templates-from-other-projects]]
==== Include Templates from Other Projects

Since templates are now served through a broker, there is now a way for you to
deploy templates from other projects.

Upload the template, then select the template from a project.

image::3.7-add-to-project-options.png[Add to Project Options]

[[ocp-37-notifications]]
==== Notifications
Key notifications are now under a single UI element, the notification drawer.

The bell icon is decorated when new notifications exist. You can mark all read,
clear all, view all, or dismiss individual ones. Key notifications are
represented with the level of information, warning, or error.

image::3.7-notification-drawer.png[Notification drawer]

[[ocp-37-improved-quota-warnings]]
==== Improved Quota Warnings
Quota notifications are now put in the notification drawer and are less intrusive.

image::37-quota-warning.png[quota warning]

There are now separate notifications for each quota type instead of one generic
warning. When at quota and not over quota, this is displayed as an informative
message. Usage and maximum is displayed in the message. You can mark *Don't Show
Me Again* per quota type. Administrators can create custom messages to the quota
warning.

[[ocp-47-environment-variable-editor-added-to-stateful-sets-page]]
==== Environment Variable Editor Added to the Stateful Sets Page

An environment variable editor is now added to the *Stateful Sets* page.

image::37-statefulset-page-envar-editor.png[Stateful Sets Page]

[[ocp-37-support-for-envfrom]]
==== Support for the EnvFrom Construct

Anything with a pod template now supports the `EnvFrom` construct that lets you
break down an entire configuration map or secret into environment variables without
explicitly setting `env name` to  `key mappings`.

[[ocp-37-notable-technical-changes]]
== Notable Technical Changes

{product-title} 3.7 introduces the following notable technical changes.

[discrete]
[[api-connectivity-variables-now-deprecated]]
=== API Connectivity Variables OPENSHIFT_MASTER and KUBERNETES_MASTER Are Now Deprecated

{product-title} deployments using a
xref:../dev_guide/deployments/deployment_strategies.adoc#custom-strategy[custom
strategy] or
xref:../dev_guide/deployments/deployment_strategies.adoc#lifecycle-hooks[hooks]
are provided with a container environment, which includes two variables for API
connectivity:

* `OPENSHIFT_MASTER`: A URL to the OpenShift API .
* `KUBERNETES_MASTER`: A URL to the Kubernetes API exposed by OpenShift.

These variables are now deprecated, as they refer to internal endpoints rather
than the published OpenShift API service endpoints. To connect to the OpenShift
API in these contexts, use
xref:../dev_guide/service_accounts.adoc#dev-guide-service-accounts[service DNS]
or the automatically exposed `KUBERNETES`
xref:../dev_guide/environment_variables.adoc#automatically-added-environment-variables[service
environment variables].

The `OPENSHIFT_MASTER` and `KUBERNETES_MASTER` environment variables are removed
from deployment container environments as of {product-title} 3.7.

[discrete]
[[openshift-hosted-ansible-variables-now-deprecated]]
=== openshift_hosted_{logging,metrics}_* Ansible Variables for the Installer Are Now Deprecated

The `openshift_hosted_{logging,metrics}_*` Ansible variables used by the
installer have been deprecated. The
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[installation
documentation] has been updated to use the newer variable names. The deprecated
variable names are planned for removal in the next minor release of OpenShift
Container Platform.

See
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#advanced-install-cluster-metrics[Configuring

[[removed-generatedeploymentconfig-api-endpoint]]
=== Removed generatedeploymentconfig API Endpoint

The `generatedeploymentconfig` API endpoint is now removed

[discrete]
[[deprecating-some-policy-related-apis]]
=== Deprecated Policy Related APIs and Commands

A large number of policy related APIs and commands are now deprecated. In
{product-title} 3.7, the policy objects are completely removed and native RBAC
is used instead. Any command trying to directly manipulate a policy object will
fail. Roles and rolebindings endpoints are still available, and they proxy the
operation to create native RBAC objects instead. The following commands do not
work against a 3.7 server:

----
$ oc adm overwrite-policy
$ oc adm migrate authorization
$ oc create policybinding
----

[NOTE]
====
A 3.7 client will display an error message when trying these command against a
3.7 server, but will still work against a previous server version, and old
client will just fail hard against a 3.7 server.
====

[[RHELAH-version-7-4-2-1-required-containerized-installations]]
=== Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host Version 7.4.2.1 or Newer Required for Containerized Installations

In {product-title} 3.7, containerized installations require Red Hat Enterprise
Linux Atomic Host version 7.4.2.1 or newer.
You can also perform containerized installations on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

[discrete]
[[installer-labeling-clusters-for-aws]]
=== Labeling Clusters for Amazon Web Services

Starting with 3.7 versions of the installer, if you configured AWS provider
credentials, you must also ensure that all instances are labeled. Then, set the
`openshift_clusterid` variable to the cluster ID. See
xref:../install_config/configuring_aws.adoc#aws-cluster-labeling[Labeling
Clusters for Amazon Web Services (AWS)] for more information.

[discrete]
[[stricter-sccs]]
=== Stricter Security Context Constraints (SCCs)

With the release of {product-title} 3.7, there are now some stricter security
context constraints (SCCs). The following capabilities are now removed:

- *nonroot* drops `KILL`, `MKNOD`, `SETUID`, and `SETGID`.
- *hostaccess* drops `KILL`, `MKNOD`, `SETUID`, and `SETGID`.
- *hostmount-anyuid* drops `MKNOD`.

It is possible that the pods that previously were admitted by these SCCs, and
were using such capabilities, will fail after upgrade. In these rare cases, the
cluster administrator should create a custom SCC for such pods.

[discrete]
[[updated-installer-support-for-cfme]]
=== CloudForms Management Engine (CFME) Support Changes

{product-title} 3.7 now fully supports
xref:ocp-37-install-config-cfme-from-ocp-installer[Installation and Configuration of CFME 4.6 from the OpenShift Installer]. As previously stated,
CFME 4.6 is not currently released. The current CFME installer implementation in
{product-title} 3.7, however, is incompatible with the Technology Preview
deployment process of CFME 4.5 as described in the
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/install_config/deploying_cfme.html[{product-title} 3.6 documentation].

The {product-title} 3.7 documentation will be updated with more complete
instructions on deploying CFME 4.6 after it has been released.

[discrete]
[[node-authorizer-plugin]]
=== Node Authorizer and Admission Plug-in for Managing Node Permissions

In {product-title} 3.7, the node authorizer and admission plug-in are used to
manage and limit a node's permissions. Therefore, nodes should be removed from
the group that previously granted them broad permissions across the cluster:

----
$ oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-group system:node system:nodes
----

In {product-title} 3.8, this step should be performed automatically via Ansible
as a post-upgrade step.

[discrete]
[[kube-service-catalog-global]]
=== The kube-service-catalog Namespace Is Global

The `kube-service-catalog` namespace is now made global by Ansible. Therefore,
if you want multicast to work in vnid 0, you must set the
`netnamespace.network.openshift.io/multicast-enabled=true` annotation on both
namespaces (`default` and `kube-service-catalog`).

[[steps-taken-during-3-6-release]]
==== Steps Taken During the 3.6 Release

A custom migration controller was created to automatically migrate OpenShift
authorization policy resources to the equivalent RBAC resources:

. If an OpenShift authorization policy resource was created or modified or
deleted, the action was automatically mirrored to the corresponding RBAC
resource

. Changes directly applied to RBAC resources were, generally, automatically rolled
back and forced to match the corresponding OpenShift authorization policy
resource. If no corresponding resource existed, the RBAC resource would be
deleted.

In essence, OpenShift authorization policy objects were the source of truth, and
the RBAC objects were forced into matching these objects.

[[release-3-6-pre-upgrade-steos-before-upgrading-to-3-7]]
==== Release 3.6 Pre-upgrade Steps Before Upgrading to 3.7

There is a small set of configurations that are possible in OpenShift
authorization policy resources that are not supported by RBAC. Such
configurations require manual migration based on the use case. To guarantee that
all Openshift authorization policy objects are in sync with RBAC, the `oc adm
migrate authorization` command has been added. This read-only command emulates
the migration controller logic, and reports if any resource is out of sync. It
is run as a pre-upgrade step via an Ansible playbook and will cause the upgrade
to fail if the objects are not in sync.

[discrete]
[[during-a-rolling-upgrade-from-release-3-6-t-3-7]]
==== During a Rolling Upgrade from Release 3.6 to 3.7

The following scenario describes a rolling upgrade

. One master is upgraded and starts proxying OpenShift authorization policy
resources and authorizing against RBAC objects.

. Old masters are still running the migration controller and one of them holds the
controller leader election lock (either because it already had it or because it
gained it by the first master being upgraded).

. The new master cannot modify any RBAC or proxied OpenShift authorization policy
objects because the migration controller will undo all changes.

. Old masters can change OpenShift authorization policy resources and the
migration controller will sync these to RBAC, making the changes visible to the
new master.

. The new master does not have the migration controller.

. Controllers only speak to their local masters in OpenShift installed via
Ansible, thus the migration controller is guaranteed to only communicate with
the old masters.

. There is a small chance that a 3.7 controller process will become the leader
once two masters have been upgraded (meaning no migrations of policy objects
will occur after this point).

. Once all masters have been upgraded from 3.6 to 3.7, OpenShift authorization
policy objects will be always proxied to RBAC objects.

. The migration controller will be gone and it will be possible to make changes to
RBAC objects directly.

*Considerations for Administrators During Rolling Upgrade*

Avoid actions that require changes to OpenShift authorization policy resources
such as the creation of new projects. If a project is created against a new
master, the RBAC resources it creates will be deleted by the migration
controller since they will be seen as out of sync from the OpenShift
authorization policy resources. If a project is created against an old master
and the migration controller is no longer present due to a 3.7 controller
process being the leader, then its policy objects will not be synced and it will
have no RBAC resources. After the 3.7 upgrade is complete, the following
read-only script can be used to determine what namespaces lack RBAC role
bindings (it is up to the cluster administrator to decide how to remediate these
namespaces):

----
#!/bin/bash

set -o errexit
set -o nounset
set -o pipefail

for namespace in $(oc get namespace -o name); do
   ns=$(echo "${namespace}" | cut -d / -f 2)
   rolebindings_count=$(oc get rolebinding.rbac -o name -n "${ns}" | wc -l)
   if [[ "${rolebindings_count}" == "0" ]]; then
       echo "Namespace ${ns} has no role bindings which may require further investigation"
   else
       echo "Namespace ${ns}: ok"
   fi
done
----

[discrete]
[[rbac-and-openshift-authorization-policy-in-3-7]]
==== RBAC and OpenShift Authorization Policy in Release 3.7

In 3.7, the RBAC objects become the source of truth. The OpenShift authorization
policy objects no longer exist as real objects; the APIs are proxied to the RBAC
resources. Therefore, creating, modifying, or deleting OpenShift authorization
policy resources seamlessly results in actions against RBAC objects. The API
master handles the conversion between these resources and legacy clients will
continue to work as if nothing has changed. The RBAC objects also support
watches, unlike the OpenShift authorization policy resources.

Policy-based resources have been removed in 3.7. However, RBAC role and binding
objects are available and provide equivalent functionality.

[[ocp37-nonproduction-installations]]
==== Non-production Installations

The recommended way for installing non-production environments may change
significantly in the next minor release of {product-title}. Administrators
should avoid tight coupling to the `atomic-openshift-installer` tool as part of
the
xref:../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[quick installer] installation and upgrade processes.

[[ocp-37-bug-fixes]]
== Bug Fixes

This release fixes bugs for the following components:

*Authentication*

* The secret for the private browser OAuth client was not correctly initialized.
Therefore, the request token endpoint did not work. This bug fix correctly
initializes the browser OAuth client on server start. The request endpoint can
now be used to request tokens.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1491193[*BZ#1491193*])

* The LDAP sync/prune command did not take into account the use of
`groupUIDNameMapping` with a whitelist.  The sync/prune command would fail with
"group not found" errors because it would query for the wrong group name. With
this bug fix, the command was updated to take `groupUIDNameMapping` into account
when using a whitelist. Now, the command queries for the correct group name when
`groupUIDNameMapping` and a whitelist are used together.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1484831[*BZ#1484831*])

* `RoleBinding` objects can now be created without first creating a
`PolicyBinding` object.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1477956[*BZ#1477956*]

*Builds*

* `ImageStream` output references and their corresponding secrets were resolved
during build creation time. If the output imagestream did not exist yet, no push
secret would be be computed, resulting in a build failure during push. With this
bug fix, the `ImageStream` output and push secret will be computed when
preparing to run the build, under logic which will retry until the `imagestream`
is available. Builds that are started before the output `imagestream` exists
will no longer fail during the push phase.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1443163[*BZ#1443163*])

* Build, delete, and watch events, and the current Jenkins job being canceled were
not handled when a build was canceled in OpenShift. Various negative,
inconsistent Jenkins job results occurred along with many exception stack traces
in the Jenkins system log. With this bug fix, Jenkins jobs are halted as soon as
the build watch event detects that a build was deleted as the result of a build
cancel action taken within OpenShift. There is now consistent, sensible behavior
for the Jenkins users when builds are canceled or deleted.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1473329[*BZ#1473329*])

* Source-to-image was not closing stdin/out/err pipes correctly in some error
cases, causing a hang to occur.  This was causing some OpenShift builds to hang
in *running* status.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1442875[*BZ#1442875*])

* The *openshift jenkins sync* plug-in was updating Jenkins pipeline build status
annotations every second, regardless of whether the status changed. The
frequency of updates would put unnecessary stress on the etcd instance backing
openshift master. Now, Jenkins pipeline build status annotations are only
updated if the status actually changes, or 30 seconds have passed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1475867[*BZ#1475867*])

* Permissions on directories injected as a build input via the image source input
mechanism have user-only access permissions. The resulting application image
cannot access the content when run as a random user ID. The directories will now
be injected with group permissions, which allows the container user to access
the directories. The directories will now be accessible at runtime as desired.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1480312[*BZ#1480312*])

* When no tag is explicitly set, docker pulls all images. Builds would pull more
images than necessary and take longer than needed. With this bug fix, a default
tag will be set when the user does not supply a tag. Only a single image will be
pulled for the build.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1498178[*BZ#1498178*])

* The BitBucket build trigger webhook did not handle older versions of the webhook
payload. Builds could not be triggered by older versions of the BitBucket
server. This bug fix adds support for the older payload format. Builds can now
be triggered by older versions of BitBucket.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1500731[*BZ#1500731*])

* A regression bug was reported whereby source-to-image builds would fail if the
source repository file system contained a broken symlink (pointing to a
non-existent item).  This is now resolved.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1506173[*BZ#1506173*])

*Command Line Interface*

* The `oc` binary for macOS is not signed. Some of the customer's company policies
do not allow users to install unsigned binaries. This bug fix signs the `oc`
binary using a Red Hat certificate. The `oc` binary is now  trusted by companies
that restrict the installation of unsigned binaries.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1436093[*BZ#1436093*])

* The `git clone` command was being run without a timeout. Therefore, the `oc
new-app` command was timing out. With this bug fix, `oc new-app` now uses `git
ls-remote` with a timeout and the `oc new-app` command will not timeout.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1488283[*BZ#1488283*])

*Containers*

* The `POOL_META_SIZE` configuration item is now added. The thin pool metadata
size was set to .1% of free space of volume group. `POOL_META_SIZE` allows the
operator to customize the size of thin pool metadata volume size to meet their
workload.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1451769[*BZ#1451769*])

*Deployments*

* Shortly after OpenShift starts, the caches might not yet be synchronised. Asa
result, scaling the replication controllers might fail. Retry the scaling when
there is a cache miss. With this bug fix, the replication controllers are scaled
properly.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1427992[*BZ#1427992*])

*Images*

* A .NET jenkins slave image for performing .NET CI/CD flows is now offered. This
makes it easier to build and test .NET code bases using Jenkins. A .NET slave
image is provided and configured out of the box in the Jenkins master image.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1451403[*BZ#1451403*])

* Jenkins now installs all plug-ins via one RPM, and the missing plug-in is now
included.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1481010[*BZ#1481010*])

* `importPolicy.insecure` is ignored in `oc import-image <imagestream:tag>` As a
result, re-import from an insecure registry fails because it expects a valid SSL
certificate. When the image stream tag exists, use its `importPolicy.insecure`.
With this bug fix, re-import succeeds.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1494231[*BZ#1494231*])

*Image Registry*

* Images younger than the threshold are not added to the dependency graph. A blob
that  is used by a young image and by a prunable image is deleted because it has
no references in the graph. Add young images to the graph and mark them as
non-prunable. With this bug fix, the blob has references and is not deleted.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1487408[*BZ#1487408*])

*  The image pruning algorithm would consider only managed images for pruning. As a
result, mirrored blobs for not managed images could not be pruned. External
images could not be removed using pruning. With this bug fix, the pruning
algorithm evaluates all the images, not just managed images. External images and
their blobs can now be pruned.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1441028[*BZ#1441028*])

* Previously, a bug in a regulator of concurrent file system access could cause a
routine to hang. This caused many builds to hang during the registry push.This
bug fix corrects the regulator. As a result, concurrent pushes no longer hang.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1436841[*BZ#1436841*])

* Previously, the `oc adm prune images` command would print confusing errors (such
as operation timeout). This bug fix enables errors to be printed with hints. As
a result, users are able to prune images, including images outside of the
OpenShift cluster.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1469654[*BZ#1469654*])

* The registry previously appended forwarded target ports to redirected location
URLs. The client’s new request to the target location lacked credentials, and as
a result, image push failed due to an authorization error. This bug fix rebased
the registry to a newer version that fixes forwarding processing logic. As a
result, clients can push images successfully to the exposed registry using
arbitrary TLS-termination.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1471707[*BZ#1471707*])

* Previously, `imagestreamtags` were not checked for dangling image references.
This caused  references to deleted images to be retained. This bug fix removes
references to deleted images. As a result, deleting an image should allow
references to the image to be deleted from `imagestreamtags`.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1386917[*BZ#1386917*])

* Documentation and command help are now updated to include information on
troubleshooting insecure connections to the secured registry. Error messages are
now printed with hints, and new flags have been added to allow for insecure
fall-back. As a result, users can now easily enforce both secure and insecure
connections.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1448595[*BZ#1448595*])

*Installer*

* Previously, the installation would fail when creating the Heketi secret because
the key file did not copy on the first master host. This bug fix enables the
installer to copy the SSH private key to the master node.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1477718[*BZ#1477718*])

* The Ansible quick install would previously fail if the hostname was manually
defined containing an uppercase letter. As a result, Kubernetes converted the
names of the nodes to lowercase and did not recognize a node name with an
uppercase letter. This bug fix ensures that hostnames for node objects are
created with lowercase letters.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1396350[*BZ#1396350*])

* Previously, the node service was not restarted when Open vSwitch was restarted,
which could result in a misconfigured networking environment. This bug fix
updates the services to ensure that the node service is restarted whenever Open
vSwitch is restarted.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1453113[*BZ#1453113*])

* Previously, Ansible facts added the `svc` domain to the `NO_PROXY` settings. As
a result, users behind proxies were not able to push to registry by DNS. This
bug fix adds the `svc` domain to the Ansible facts code. As a result, users
behind a proxy can now push to registry by DNS.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1467776[*BZ#1467776*])

* The flannel network was previously defined using the same subnet as the
Kubernetes services subnet. This caused a conflict between services and SDN
networks. The flannel network is now correctly defined by the
osm_cluster_network_cidr variable.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1473858[*BZ#1473858*])

* The necessary role for role binding in openshift_metrics was missing due to
being processed out of order in the role. The role binding creation would fail
and the role would fail to install. This bug fix updates the metrics to create
the role immediately. As a result, role binding can be created during
installation.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1476195[*BZ#1476195*])

* The etcd scaleup playbook had an error where it attempted to run commands on
hosts other than the host that was currently being scaled up resulting in an
error if the other hosts did not yet have certain dependencies met. The
playbooks now properly target only the host currently being scaled up.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1490739[*BZ#1490739*])

* The stand-alone entry point for the `openshift_storage_nfs` task did not have
the `os_firewall` role included.  This resulted in the firewall not being
properly installed and configured.  The `os_firewall` has been added to the
play. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1491657[*BZ#1491657*])

* The etcd quota backend was set to 2GB by default. This resulted in a cluster
going into a hold state, blocking all writes into the etcd storage. The default
quota backend was increased to 4GB by default to encompass the storage needs of
bigger clusters.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1492891[*BZ#1492891*])

* When a company CA is added as a named certificates, the CA is added to
`ca-bundle.crt` as well. This can cause client certificate popups when using
IE,Safari or Chrome if the user has client certs configured via the browser. The
code has been changed to not use the `ca-bundle.crt` and use the internal CA for
client cert CA.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1493276[*BZ#1493276*])

* As part of deprecating the use of `openshift_hosted_{logging,metrics}_*`
variables, a default size for the storage volume wasn’t set for an NFS
installation. As a result, the playbook would fail that the variable was not
defined at runtime. The code was changed to use the default '10Gi' if not
specified. The installer runs as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1495203[*BZ#1495203*])

* The disconnected installer did not have a way to specify a username/password to
 login to the docker repository to access downloaded images, requiring the user
 to disable authentication. The installation script now includes a mechanism for
 entering credentials.
 (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1500642[*BZ#1500642*])

* A new Docker option `--signature-enabled` that was introduced in a recent Docker
release is set to `False` by default. The {product-title}  installation removes
the parameter during the installation and Docker would get the default value of
`True`. The Ansible scripts have been changed to include this option.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1502560[*BZ#1502560*])

* Upgrading the logging component from 3.4.1 to 3.5.0 using Ansible failed with a
`No Elasticsearch pods found running` error. The logging upgrade has been
disabled as the EFK stack used for 3.4 and 3.5 is the same. The upgrade
functionality is not necessary.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1435144[*BZ#1435144*])

* When using ansible to configure the openID-connect provider for the OpenID and
GitLab providers resulted in an error when setting `challenge` to true. This
happens because of the validate function did not allowing this. The Ansible
validate function was removed for OpenID and GitLab providers. The installation
can complete successfully, and login succeeds.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1444367[*BZ#1444367*])

* Docker 1.12.6-34 uses *_/etc/containers/registries.conf_* to define registries,
but {product-title} installer  uses *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_*. As a result,
system containers were reading registry information from the incorrect file. The
code was changed to duplicate the registries in both locations to ensure
additional/blocked/insecure registries are honored.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1460930[*BZ#1460930*])

* A containerized installation with system containers enabled
(`use_system_containers=true`) failed due to missing mounts. The code was
updated so that the install performs as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1463574[*BZ#1463574*])

* The {product-title} would correctly fail is the public host name was 64
characters or greater. However, the error message displayed did not report the
source of the failure. The installer has been changed to report if the
installation failed due to hostname length.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1467790[*BZ#1467790*])

*  When installing the service catalog, the template service broker (TSB) was not
getting created. As a result, the TSB had to be created manually. The code has
been changed so that the TSB is created automatically.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1470623[*BZ#1470623*])

* Input for `include_granted_scopes`, which was expected to become a single quoted
boolean string, was instead being interpreted and written to the file incorrectly. The
resulting configuration file could have the wrong value for
`include_granted_scopes` and removal of a code block attempted to interpret the
input for `include_granted_scopes`. Input that is expected to land via
`include_granted_scopes` now passes to the *_master-config.yml_* as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1488505[*BZ#1488505*])

* Because the Docker image availability health check does not support
authenticated registries, checks failed when running against an authenticated
registry. The code was changed to allow Docker to health check authenticated
registries.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1488833[*BZ#1488833*])

* Running the `redeploy-router-certificates.yml` playbook caused the
router pod to fail (`CrashLoopBackOff`). The code was changed so that after
running the `redeploy-router-certificates.yml` playbook, the router pod runs as
expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1490186[*BZ#1490186*])

* With Ansible 2.3, warnings are issued when using Jinja delimiters in 'when'
conditions.  The delimiters have been removed from the code base to avoid these
warnings.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1490268[*BZ#1490268*])

* Due to an earlier code change, the installation failed when giving a wildcard
certificate to the installer. The code has been changed to properly copy a
wildcard certificate during installation.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1492786[*BZ#1492786*])

* Because of internal refactoring, the list of hostnames in the `NO_PROXY` file
was empty. The facts have been restored The list of NO_PROXY names is correctly
defined.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1495142[*BZ#1495142*])

* When `openshift_docker_use_system_container` was set to `false`, the installer
was incorrectly attempting to start the container engine, resulting in the
installation failing. The installer code was changed and the installation
proceeds as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1496725[*BZ#1496725*])

* The installer can now use an inventory specified as a directory rather than just
a single file. This adds a parameter `INVENTORY_DIR` to the openshift-ansible
image such that the user can indicate that ansible-playbook should use a mounted
inventory directory.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1498908[*BZ#1498908*])

* The logic for selecting the Enterprise registry was moved to a location that
which was never read when installing system containers. Enterprise installs
using system containers would fail as the openshift-ansible image could not be
found in the Docker hub registry. Moved the enterprise registry logic into a
high level playbook so that it is set for all runtime set ups. The enterprise
images can be found and installation works.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1503860[*BZ#1503860*])

* Due to recent simplification and refactoring there was a possibility of
*_/etc/atomic.conf_* not being updated with proxy values before the first Atomic
command was executed. Proxy use with the Atomic command did not work during the
install. A new openshift_atomic role has been created for atomic specific tasks.
The first task added is proxy which handles updating /etc/atomic.conf to ensure
the proper proxy configuration is configured. This task file is then included
(via include_role) in system container related task files. The atomic command
always is able to use the properly defined proxy settings.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1503903[*BZ#1503903*])

* An undefined variable was used in a task. The undefined variable caused a jinja
template evaluation error which would crash the installation. The undefined
variable has been removed and replaced with more informative error text. The
playbook does not error out for external NFS storage class installations.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1504535[*BZ#1504535*])

* The OpenShift Health Checker was not part of an Installer Phase and was not
reported after playbook execution. The OpenShift Health Checker section of the
primary installer path has been moved to its own section and an installer
'phase' has been added to report on installer status.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1504593[*BZ#1504593*])

* When updating the `openshift-ansible` package, all subpackages are now updated
in order to keep them in sync.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1506971[*BZ#1506971*])

* The NetworkManager dispatcher script responsible for configuring a host to use
dnsmasq operated in a non-atomic manner, resulting in failed DNS queries during
boot up. The script has been refactored to ensure that required services are
verified before *_/etc/resolv.conf_* is reconfigured.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1410288[*BZ#1410288*])

* Using the Ansible installer to install metrics with dynamic storage failed.
Installation now fails if the parameter storage kind = 'dynamic' is set without
enabling dynamic provisioning.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1415297[*BZ#1415297*])

* An error occurred from the yum module during the upgrade process. Yum
transactions are now retried.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1479533[*BZ#1479533*])

* The 'registry-console' image stream did not have a source tag specified, causing
it to be improperly imported.The source tag has been added to the image stream
ensuring that it imports properly.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1480442[*BZ#1480442*])

* When enabling API aggregation with the ovs-multitenant SDN driver, creating a
global project failed due to a performance latency issue. While creating a
global project, the netnamespace is now checked to ensure availability and the
Ansible Playbook Bundle finishes the operation.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1487959[*BZ#1487959*])

* The device mapper kernel modules may not have been loaded on a host if
`overlay2` storage was used, which prevented the gluster storage system from
working properly. With this fix, the installer now ensures that when gluster is
used the `dm_thin_pool`, `dm_snapshot`, and `dm_mirror` modules are loaded.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1490905[*BZ#1490905*])

* Previously, if there was no DNS search path in */etc/resolv.conf*, then the
NetworkManager dispatcher would omit adding `cluster.local` to the search path.
With this bug fix, the dispatcher script was updated to ensure that a search
path is created if one did not already exist.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1496593[*BZ#1496593*])

* The example inventories have been updated to clearly indicate that the NFS
export directory must only consist of lowercase alphanumeric characters, hyphens
or periods, and must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1488366[*BZ#1488366*])

[[ocp37-quick-installer-known-issue]]
* The quick installer tool, `atomic-openshift-installer`, was initially blocked
for use with {product-title} 3.7 due to a bug. This has now been fixed in the
latest update.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1509112[*BZ#1509112*])

*Logging*

* Messages were read into Fluentd’s memory buffer and were lost if the pod was
restarted because Fluentd considered them read, but they were not pushed to
storage. This caused the loss of any message not stored, but already read by
Fluentd. This fix replaced the memory buffer with a file based buffer. As a
result, the file buffered messages are pushed to storage once Fluentd restarts.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1460749[*BZ#1460749*])

* Kibana visualizations and dashboard for monitoring container and pod logs allows
administrator users, cluster-admin or cluster-reader, to view logs by
deployment, namespace, pod, and container. The script
`es_load_kibana_ui_objects` is used to load dashboards and other Kibana UI
objects for the given user. To use, run `oc exec $espod --
es_load_kibana_ui_objects user-name`. It exists inside the Elasticsearch and
ES-OPS pod, and must be run inside those pods. Additionally, it requires some
indices and other objects set up by the OpenShift Elasticsearch plug-in, so the
user must login to Kibana or Elasticsearch before using this script. This will
also add an index pattern for project.* and load the necessary index pattern
file. Kibana visualizations and dashboard gives administrators an easier way to
view Kubernetes/OpenShift related logs in the cluster, allowing admin users have
graphs and a dashboard to use to view logs from OpenShift pods and containers.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1467963[*BZ#1467963*])

* The execute bit in the downstream repo was previously not set for `run.sh`.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1474715[*BZ#1474715*])

* The value of the `buffer_chunk_limit` is now configurable, and defaults to 1M.
To configure the `buffer_chunk_limit`, set the value to the environment variable
`BUFFER_SIZE_LIMIT` or `openshift_logging_fluentd_buffer_size_limit` in the
Ansible inventory file. To cover various types of input, `buffer_chunk_limit`
needs to be configurable. The “size of the emitted data exceeds
buffer_chunk_limit" can be fixed by configuring `buffer_chunk_limit`.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1413147[*BZ#1413147*])

* Role permissions were generated based upon the project, causing queries to be
disallowed if they involved multiple indices. This fix generates role
permissions based on the user and not the project, allowing users to query
across multiple indices.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1445425[*BZ#1445425*])

* The `openshift-elasticsearch-plugin` was creating ACL roles based on the
provided name, which could include slashes and commas. This caused the dependent
`lib` to not properly evaluate roles. This fix hashes the name when creating ACL
roles so they no longer contain the invalid characters. Now, users can use
kibana and logging.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1456584[*BZ#1456584*])

* The `ansible` parameter name is confusing to use and does not properly reflect how
it is consumed by Fluentd. This fix removed the parameter, allowing Fluentd to
consistently collect logs based on the source it detects.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1466152[*BZ#1466152*])

* Elasticsearch was logging to console logs, resulting Elasticsearch ending up in
a feedback loop ingesting its own logs. This fix turned off console logs in
favor of file logs. As a result, the feedback loop is broken but users will need
to setup Elasticsearch log volume with file rotation to get ES logs.
Additionally, `oc logs` against an Elasticsearch pod will no longer be
sufficient to retrieve Elasticsearch pod logs.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1432607[*BZ#1432607*])

* Elasticsearch default value for sharing storage between Elasticsearch instances
was wrong. This caused the incorrect default value to be allowed an
Elasticsearch pod starting up (when another Elasticsearch pod was shutting down)
to create a new location on the PV for managing the storage volume, duplicating
data, and in some instances, potentially causing data loss. With this fix, all
Elasticsearch pods now run with `node.max_local_storage_nodes` set to `1`. As a
result, the Elasticsearch pods starting up and shutting down will no longer
share the same storage and prevent the data duplication and data loss.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1460564[*BZ#1460564*])

* Use underscores when providing memory switches to the Nodejs runtime instead of
dashes. As a result, the Nodejs interpreter understands the request.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1464020[*BZ#1464020*])

* The `openshift_logging_purge_logging` Ansible variable was introduced to purge
logging persistent data. Because the `openshift_logging_install_logging=false`
will keep persistent data, there was a need for a complete uninstall. As a
result, there are no changes to `openshift_logging_install_logging`, with the
additional variable `openshift_logging_purge_logging` for complete uninstall.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1467265[*BZ#1467265*])

* In the configuration for the Fluentd systemd input plug-in,  the
`read_from_head` parameter was not set properly based on the environment
variable `JOURNAL_READ_FROM_HEAD` or its corresponding Ansible parameter
`openshift_logging_fluentd_journal_read_from_head`. Due to the problem, the full
contents of pre-existing logs were indexed instead of the latest logs captured
by “tail” when a `pos_file` does not exist, which happens when the logging
system is initially deployed or a `pos_file` is deleted. With this bug fix, the
parameter is correctly set. And based on the setting, if
`JOURNAL_READ_FROM_HEAD=true`, all the logs are indexed; if
`JOURNAL_READ_FROM_HEAD=false`, logs read from "tail" are indexed when a
`pos_file` does not exist.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1488941[*BZ#1488941*])

* When deploying `logging-fluentd` with `secure-forward` to send the collected
logs to `logging-mux`, it requires `openshift_logging_mux_client_mode=maximal`
with `openshift_logging_use_mux=True` in the ansible inventory if the Fluentd
container and the `mux` container are on the same node. If
`openshift_logging_mux_client_mode=maximal` is set without
`openshift_logging_use_mux=True`, the `mux` secret directory
*/etc/fluent/muxkeys* is mounted in the Fluentd container although the secret
directory does not exist. It makes Fluentd hang when it tries to access the
`mux` secrets at the startup time. This patch checks the value of
`openshift_logging_mux_client_mode` and `openshift_logging_use_mux` in the
Ansible playbook and if the former is true while the latter is false, then it
does not mount the `mux` secret directory in the Fluentd container. Also, if the
Fluentd start script finds the `mux` secret directory does not exist, it
disables `openshift_logging_mux_client_mode` even if it is enabled.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1490647[*BZ#1490647*])

* The `json-file` parser was assuming the "time" field was a Time object instead
of a String object, which does not have a "utc" method, causing the logs to fill
with the error. This fix checks the type of object for the "time" field, and
convert the String to a Time object if necessary. As a result, `json-file` read
time values are parsed correctly with no errors.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1491405[*BZ#1491405*])

* The `openshift-elasticsearch-plugin` was creating ACL roles based on the
provided name which could include slashes and commas. This caused the dependent
`lib` to not properly evaluate roles. This fix hashes the name when creating ACL
roles so they no longer contain the invalid characters. As a result, users can
use Kibana and logging.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=14942395[*BZ#1494239*])

*Web Console*

* Previously in the web console pod terminal, you could not enter third-level
characters using the AltGr key such as ‘|’ (pipe) in some keyboard layouts. Now
Alt+Gr-<character> combinations work properly in the web console pod terminal.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1292507[*BZ#1292507*])

* In the web console, copying and pasting content from the terminal could result
in extra spaces being added to the end of each line. Now when you copy content
from the terminal, no extra spaces are added.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1395564[*BZ#1395564*])

* The left navigation column did not support vertical scrolling. When the browser
viewport was less than 440 pixels tall and wider than 768 pixels the bottom left
navigation link was not accessible. The new left navigation column markup
supports vertical scrolling. Now, all left navigation links are accessible at
all browser viewport sizes and zoom levels.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1375134[*BZ#1375134*])

* Previously, on iOS Safari, number inputs used the full keyboard rather than the
number input. Now inputs that accept only numbers show the iOS number pad for
easier entry.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1470976[*BZ#1470976*])

* Previously, some requests for templates in the web console could timeout or
 take a long time to complete over high latency network connections. This could
 cause an error when loading the *Add to Project* page. The web console can now
 load templates using much less data, which fixes the problem.
 (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1471033[*BZ#1471033*])

* Clarifies help text on the Route creation and editing pages to make it clear
that the CA certificates should be certificate chains.
 (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1471155[*BZ#1471155*])

* A known bug in Internet Explorer resulted in the layout of pod charts
overflowing their containers on the overview page. As a result, the pod charts
looked mis-aligned in the UI. The fix involved increasing the specificity on
some CSS declarations so that they only apply when they are needed, which is
during a deployment when the pod charts are being animated. As a result, the pod
charts appear correctly aligned in Internet Explorer.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1473512[*BZ#1473512*])

* A known bug in Internet Explorer resulted in the layout of catalog items taking
up too much space. As a result, not all the catalog items were visible in
Internet Explorer. The fix involved adding an additional CSS declaration as a
workaround for IE. As a result, the catalog items now take up the correct space
in IE.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1473615[*BZ#1473615*])

* The code was using an empty `envFrom` entry when creating/editing the
environment variable, causing a validation failure when adding or editing an
environment variable using *Deployment Configuration* page of the web console.
The user would receive an error that the deployment configuration is invalid.
The `envFrom` entry is now properly submitted and the user can add or edit
environment variables from the web console.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1502914[*BZ#1502914*])

* Various errors were present in the source code that prevented Config maps were
not available from the drop-down menu on the *Edit Deployment Config* page for
pre and post-hooks when using *Add Value from Config Map or Secret*. These
errors have been corrected. Config maps appear in the appropriate drop-downs.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1502914[*BZ#1502914*])

* Previously, secrets with null values would display incorrectly when values were
revealed on the secret details page. Now the web console will correctly display
the secret key as having no value.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1510346[*BZ#1510346*])

* Previously there was a quirk in the drag-and-drop behavior of the key value
editor.  While reordering an env var it might jump more than a single node at a
time.  This bug fix ensures that the drag-and-drop behavior will behave as
expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1428991[*BZ#1428991*])

* On the project overview, the *Application* drop-down menu was incorrectly set to
`overflow:hidden`. As a result, when the application row is collapsed, the menu
did not display fully.  The `overflow: hidden` parameter has been removed and
the menu is now fully visible.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1460153[*BZ#1460153*])

* Previously, deleting a service account would ignore the SAs namespace.  This
means that the delete action from the web UI could delete multiple service
account rolebindings under the service account tab if service accounts from
different namespaces had the same name. The delete action on the SA tab will now
respect the namespace and only delete the specified SA rolebinding from the
correct namespace.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1507730[*BZ#1507730*])

* The *Configuration* tab of the *Deployment* page in the web console was laid out
in such a way that a large gap could appear when the right column contents were
longer than the left column contents. The fix involved changing the layout
markup so the gap does not appear. The result is there is no longer a gap
between Volumes and Triggers when the right column content is longer than the
left column content.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1505255[*BZ#1505255*])

*Master*

* Ansible installs with a caBundle on the service catalog API service resulting in
a _500 Internal Server Error_ on the product overview page in the web console.
The installer was changed to install with `insecureSkipTLSVerify` flag set to
`true`. As a result, the product overview page works as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1473523[*BZ#1473523*])

* CronJobs are placed in batch/v2alpha1 group, whereas other batch resources are
placed in batch/v1. Due to this fact, some API machinery does not handle
multiversioning problems properly. The restmapper, which is responsible for
matching resource with appropriate api group version to handle multi-versioned
apis, was updated. Describing resources works as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1480453[*BZ#1480453*])

* The installer was configured to watch specific resources that do not support
watching. As a result, the *_/var/log/messages_* file was reporting errors and
warnings related to the issue. The installer has been corrected to not watch
these resources and the errors/warnings are not generated.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1452206[*BZ#1452206*])

* Creating project using project template does not use the substituted project
name, but the namespace name. As a result, the user is not able to use
parametrized name as a project name as the generated suffix or prefix might be
dropped. The code was changed to allow the use of substituted project name when
creating the namespace.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1454535[*BZ#1454535*])

* Node status information was getting rate limited during heavy traffic causing
some nodes to fall into not ready status. The code was changed to use a separate
connection for node healthiness. As a result, node status is reported without
any problems.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1464653[*BZ#1464653*])

* Running multiple clusters in a single authorization zone in AWS requires
resources be tagged. If the clusters are not tagged, the clusters will not work
properly. The master controllers process will require a ClusterID on resources
in order to run. Existing resources will need to be tagged manually. Multiple
clusters in one az will work properly once tagged.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1468579[*BZ#1468579*])

* An upstream patch caused an error with the `oc apply` command. The patch deleted
an element from an array (eg. env) and then reordered or modified another array
(eg. volumeMounts). The `kubectl apply` fails with the _unable to find api field
in struct Container for the json field "$setElementOrder/env". The algorithm was
updated so that it continues operation under described condition. The `oc apply`
works without any problems.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1497325[*BZ#1497325*])

*Metrics*

* When either a certificate within the chain at `serviceaccount/ca.crt` or any of
the certificates within the provided truststore file contain white space after
the `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` declaration, the Java keytool rejects the certificate
with an error, causing Origin Metrics to fail to start. As a workaround, Origin
Metrics will now attempt to remove the spaces before feeding the certificate to
the Keytool. Admins should ensure their certificates don't contain such spaces.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1503450[*BZ#1503450*])

* When deleting a large number of pods, the *hawkular-metrics* pod log reports
_Pool is busy_ errors. The condition was fixed upstream in Cassandra and
clusters with a large number of pods should not report the  _Pool is busy_
error. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1451209[*BZ#1451209*])

* When opening the metrics page in a disconnected environment, Hawkular attempted
 to connect to external web sites, such asfonts.googleapis.com. Because the
 cluster cannot connect to Internet, the metrics page loaded slowly. Changes
 were made upstream so that Hawkular does not attempt to connect to external web
 sites when there is no access to the Internet. As a result, in a disconnected
 environment, the metrics page loads properly.
 (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1466403[*BZ#1466403*])

* In Cassandra, it is possible that new generation objects (with the `-Xmn` flag)
can exceed the maximum size of the Java memory heap (with the `-Xmx` flag). If
that happens, the JVM will log a warning at start up, but Cassandra still
starts. The code was changed to set the size of new generation objects at ¼ of
the maximum heap size.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1471239[*BZ#1471239*])

* Cassandra metrics would not start up if the commit log exceeded the limit
applied to the log. An out-of-memory (OOM) condition would cause metrics to
constantly start and stop. The commit log size is now based on total available
memory. Also, log compression is no longer used, which will reduce the demand on
resources. As a result, large logs should not affect metrics operation.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1473013[*BZ#1473013*])

*Networking*

* When changes are made to software defined network (SDN) plugin, the master
controller will fail to start when there are headless services in the cluster.
As a result, when initializing {product-title}, SDN fails to allow a nil service
IP and {product-title} was unable to start.  The code was changed to allow nil
as a valid value of `srv.Spec.ClusterIP`. {product-title} SDN properly starts
after changing network with headless service.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1451881[*BZ#1451881*])

* The nodes local IP address is not part of the Open vSwitch (OVS) rules. If you
deny 0.0.0.0/0  and allow a DNS name in the egress network policy, the node will
not be able to reach that allowed address because DNS name resolution is blocked
Adding the local node IP to the ovs allowed rule so that the name resolution
will not be blocked. Also adding a note to the docs for the case when dns
resolution does not happen on the node. {product-title} can successfully block
0.0.0.0/0 as a `cidrSelector` and allow specific DNS names through.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1458849[*BZ#1458849*])

* If the `service network restart` command is executed on a machine while the
{product-title} node process is running, a `stop()` function properly disables
IP forwarding.  However, the `start()` function was not re-enabling it. The code
was changed to persist IP forwarding on nodes during network restarts.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1477716[*BZ#1477716*])

* While upgrading nodes, if any invalid network CIDRs are detected, nodes might be
unable to upgrade and will fail. The code was changed to not fail with invalid
CIDRs. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1506017[*BZ#1506017*])

* The Kubernetes CNI (Container Network Interface) plug-in generates errors if
`hostNetwork=true` is configured for pods. This issue has been fixed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1507257[*BZ#1507257*])

* Because of upstream issues in Kubernetes, vSphere had networking problems when
used with {product-title}. The periodic resync of Kubernetes into
{product-title} included the required changes. vSphere now works correctly.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1433236[*BZ#1433236*])

* Because of changes with upstream Kubernetes, the `oc adm join-projects`, `oc adm
isolate-projects` and other commands that depend on the pod update operation
will not work. The code was changed to fetch some required elements from the
Container Runtime Interface (CRI) directly. As a result, the pod update
operation works correctly and the commands work as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1453190[*BZ#1453190*])

* Because of default authorization,  project administrators (standard user)  were
not able to manage network policies for their own projects. Changes to the code
now allow project admins to create, delete, list the network polices in their
own projects.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1461208[*BZ#1461208*])

* An invalid HostSubnet could not be fixed. As a result, if a node with an invalid
HostSubnet is restarted, the node assigned to the HostSubnet, would fail to
start. The code has been changed to allow an invalid HostSubnet to be changed,
using commands such as `oc edit hostsubnet`.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1466239[*BZ#1466239*])

* Adding an IPv6 address to a host subnet as an egress resulted in a panic error.
The code has been changed to better handle IPv6 addresses with a meaningful
error message.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1500664[*BZ#1500664*])

* Using ipfailover when a node fails ensures that a second node receives traffic.
Previously, traffic went back to the first node once it is back up, potentially
causing traffic imbalance. Now, using the `--preemption-strategy="nopreempt"`
option, allows the administrator to control the default strategy, meaning that
the strategy to switch to a higher priority node is suppressed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1465987[*BZ#1465987*])

* A log message similar to the following was repeatedly appearing:
+
----
LoadBalancerRR: Removing endpoints for ops-health-monitoring/pull-07062050z-ie:8080-tcp
----
+
This caused the logs to be filled with information not deemed important. The
message has been hidden from the logs.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1468420[*BZ#1468420*])

* Previously, the image for the default network diagnostics pod was mismatched,
causing the diagnostics to fail. The image checking has been fixed, and the
network diagnostics works without errors.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1481147[*BZ#1481147*])

* Previously, conntrack entries for UDP traffic were not erased when an endpoint
was added for a service that previously had no endpoints. This meant that the
system could end up incorrectly caching a rule that would cause traffic to that
service be dropped rather than being send to the new endpoint. The relevant
conntrack entries have been changed to be deleted at the right time, meaning
that the UDP services work correctly when endpoints are added and removed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1487438[*BZ#1487438*])

*Pod*

* Previously, network debug tests were showing errors regarding not being able to
read stats from a changing pod. This was because, even though the container
process had exited, but the cgroup wasn’t removed, leading to a Docker container
with no tasks. The log spam has been reduced.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1328913[*BZ#1328913*])

* Because of an outdated Go format, kubemarl-scale was consistently failing. The
version of Golang was updated, stopping the failures.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1454239[*BZ#1454239*])

* Previously, the HPA V1 was unable to get the metrics from the resource CPU. This
was due to the custom setup of the HPA controller changing. The settings have
been restored.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1458663[*BZ#1458663*])

* Previously, multi-node environments produced “Failed to watch” errors. This was
because the controller didn’t have permission to watch resources, which meant
its behaviour was to retry every second by default. The controller has been
given the permission to watch resources.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1465361[*BZ#1465361*])

* Previously, the OpenShift master failed to start when using Openstack
integration without Neutron LBaaS, which is not available in OpenShift. The
issue now gives a warning instead of a failure, which mean the master will start
successfully even if the LBaaS is not available.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1465722[*BZ#1465722*])

* Previously, project volumes were not included in security context constraints,
meaning that pods could not be used with projected volumes. The projected
volumes have been added to the correct SCCs, and the projected volumes can be
used as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1448816[*BZ#1448816*])

* Init containers with resource requests or limits were producing error messages.
This was due to a mismatch in the sum of a pod’s container resources, resulting
in the parent cgroup choosing the incorrect resource. The issue has been fixed
upstream and the correct resources are being chosen.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1459826[*BZ#1459826*])

* Previously, when a deployment configuration was created without any memory
information when quota restrictions were in place, no error message would
appear. The expected results were a “FailedCreate” event, much like with
replication controllers. The “FailedCreate” event now appears when the pod
immediately fails.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1465801[*BZ#1465801*])

* A design limitation in previous versions does not account for memory-backed
volumes against the pod's cumulative memory limit. So, it is possible for a user
to exhaust memory on the node by creating a large file in an memory-backed
volume, regardless of the memory limit. Now, pod-level cgroups have been added
to, among other things, enforce limits on memory-backed volumes, resulting in
memory-backed volume sizes now being bound by cumulative pod memory limits.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1422049[*BZ#1422049*])

* Previously, upgrading to 3.4 gave a “insufficient pods” error. This was due to a
change in configuration from a `max-pods` variable to the smaller of 250 or 10
pods per core. The upgrade broke installations with fewer pods. The change has
been made so that the `max-pods` variable has become the limiting variable.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1430484[*BZ#1430484*])

* Previously, error messages in the status field of failed builds said “error”
instead of an actual error message. This was because the status was showing the
message from the Docker daemon returning the failed pod message. The message now
returns a more helpful error message.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1449820[*BZ#1449820*])

* Previously, registry pods were occasionally reporting liveness and readiness
probe failures with the message `http2: no cached connection was available`.
This was due to an upstream issue where the liveness and readiness probes get in
the way of each other. The problem has been fixed upstream, and updated for
{product-title} version 3.7.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1454858[*BZ#1454858*])

* Large clusters with a large amount of HPAs or unhealthy pods sent a large number
of events if an object was unable to reach its desired state. This bug fix
updates the event client to protect against spamming master components. As a
result, this controls traffic to the masters and reduces writed to etcd.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1466933[*BZ#1466933*])

* For all resources other than pod or PVCs, the quota controller would make a LIST
call per namespace to determine current usage counts. This caused quota
recalculation to take an extended period of time. This bug fix reduces LIST
calls made by the resource quota controller by using shared informer caches. As
a result, LIST operations made to the master were reduced and information was
pulled from a shared cache in the controller.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1473370[*BZ#1473370*])

* Previously, users were not able to look up PVC information for the Drupal
database without receiving scheduler log spam. This bug fix prevents unnecessary
logging of a harmless error from a PVC-related scheduler predicate.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1475558[*BZ#1475558*])

* Previously, messages originating from the AWS SDK were causing partial log
entries due to new lines in the message itself. Error messages are now properly
quoted so all messages are
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1462445[*BZ#1462445*])

*Routing*

* Previously, the help information included a redundant example. This bug fix
removed the redundant example. As a result, the help information is now more
concise.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1440620[*BZ#1440620*])

* Previously, the code path automatically prepended the partition name to the
vserver name. If the vserver was in a path of length more than 1, then the path
was lost because only the partition name was prepended. This bug fix prepends
the entire path of vserver instead of just concatenating the partition name and
vserver name.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1465304[*BZ#1465304*])

* Previously, if you had a router of a previous version of {product-title} a 403
http status resulted when the router stats were accessed without credentials.
This web browser did not prompt the user for a password so the stats were
inaccessible. The code has been updated to return a 403 when no credentials are
passed and the browser now prompts the user for a password, so the router stats
are visible in a web browser.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1467257[*BZ#1467257*])

* Previously, the IP failover keepalived image did not support IPV6 addresses or
ranges, as well as IP address validation. Adding IPV6 addresses to the `oc adm
ipfailover` command resulted in a new vrrp section pertaining to the wrong
address. The code has been updated, and inputting invalid IPV4 and IPV6
addresses now return an error as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1459960[*BZ#1459960*])

* Previously, the x-forwarded header and its associated information, displayed the
IPV6 form in IPV4 form. The `ROUTER_IP_V4_V6_MODE` environment variable has been
created to control which form is displayed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1471255[*BZ#1471255*])

* Previously, the locking was overly broad, causing events to not be processed
while an HAProxy reload was happening. This meant that route changes would take
hours to process. The locking has been made more fine-grained, so that events
can be processed in parallel. And changes  are now processed within the time of
two reloads of the router.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1471899[*BZ#1471899*])

* An error in the router code caused by a missing locking around a router data
structure was causing errors causing the router pod to occasionally crash and
restart. The locking has been fixed, and the router now works as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1473031[*BZ#1473031*])

* When running the `oc adm router --expose-metrics` command, the router
 deployment failed because the generated deployment configuration object was not
 compatible. This was due to a background change upstream. A change has been
 made with the `oc adm router` command, and the command can now handle
 `--expose-metrics`.
 (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1488954[*BZ#1488954*])

* Previously, multiple service catalog objects named “default” were not a problem,
but a change made them all top level. This bug fixes the object names to be
unique. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1420543[*BZ#1420543*])

*Service Broker*

* Previously, a fresh installation using the `openshift-ansible` method and with a
`service-catalog` resulted in the service class being empty, resulting in the
stage registry giving a bad response. The administrator would need to see the
ASB logs and trigger a manual bootstrap. Now, if the bootstrap fails, the broker
fails, and the kubelet retries the process until it works correctly.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1468173[*BZ#1468173*])

* This bug fixes running the `service-catalog` binaries for the apiserver and
controller manager when used with the `--version` option, which previously
reported `UNKNOWN`, but now reports the correct value.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1476134[*BZ#1476134*],
link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1475251[*BZ#1475251*])

* Previously, when deleting a namespace, the Ansible Service Broker (ASB)
attempted to execute deprovision playbook actions using a namespace in a
"terminating" state. This led to the APB actions being rejected, because of the
namespace terminating. As a result, deprovision fails, and both the APB
deprovision sandbox and target namespace were not deleted. Now, instead of
executing APB actions on namespace deletion, the records of the services to be
deprovisioned are cleaned up, allowing kubernetes to delete the resources
normally, meaning the target namespace is properly deleted by Kubernetes.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1476173[*BZ#1476173*])

* The error message returned when a user does not have permission to modify a
TemplateInstance is updated.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1460145[*BZ#1460145*])

* Previously, only one annotation returned when both _expose_ and _base64-expose_
annotations were defined in template (per bind request). This issue is fixed in
the latest release.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1463570[*BZ#1463570*])

* Previously, Ansible Playbook Bundles (APB) that have been removed from their
 container catalog, appeared in Ansible Service Broker (ASB) as valid options
 even after *bootstrap* was performed. This issue is fixed now.
 (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1463798[*BZ#1463798*])

* Previously, there were inconsistency between the serviceclass and the
server-broker. After creating a broker, the controller-manager only fetched the
catalog once. This resulted in inability to updates the serviceclass unless the
broker was recreated. This is fixed now.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1469448[*BZ#1469448*])

* Previously, the Ansible service broker would fail on provisioning because of
incorrect permissions. This is now fixed and Ansible service broker now has the
required permissions for creating new namespaces and dynamic service account in
these new namespace to run APBs.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1469485[*BZ#1469485*])

* The `oc version` command did not get OpenShift version against the ansible
deployed service catalog environment. The version information is added the
command now reports correct information.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1471717[*BZ#1471717*])

* Previously, when the Ansible Service Broker started it could not communicate  to
the configured registry, and therefore got no information about APBs. This was
because of a missing setting in the ansible service broker configuration. The
`broker: bootstrap_on_startup: true` setting is now added in the configuration
which resolves this issue.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1471973[*BZ#1471973*])

* Previously, the ansible service broker container would fail if the dockerhub
credentials were not supplied because the encryption script required them. It is
now reconfigured to use RHCC adapter and the dockerhub credentials are optional.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1464222[*BZ#1464222*])

* Previously, bad data was being returned from the bootstrapped registry. This was
because the broker failed to bootstrap and it used to error out due to a null
pointer de-reference. The broker now has logic to avoid de-referencing null
pointers if the data is corrupted. This issue is now resolved and the broker
skips image with bad data and continues with next one.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1467905[*BZ#1467905*])

* The Service Broker Installer was setting incorrect configuration values for
`launchapbonbind`, this is fixed and configuration value is now set as
`launch_apb_on_bind`.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1467948[*BZ#1467948*])

* The role for Service Accounts used by the Ansible Service Broker is updated. The
Broker runs under `asb` service account set to `admin` through a
_ClusterRoleBinding_ and APBs run under a temporary service account granted
`edit` through a _RoleBinding_ in the target namespace.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1470824[*BZ#1470824*])

*Storage*

* Creating a new persistent volume claim (PVC) using OpenStack Cinder storageclass
resulted in the PVC being stuck in `Pending` state. This bug fix re-configured
the cloud provider openstack.conf to use OpenStack Keystone V3. As a result,
dynamic provisioning of new Cinder volumes works as documented.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1491331[*BZ#1491331*])

* Previously, the Gophercloud library used by OpenShift to communicate with the
OpenStack API did not accept HTTP status 300 in pagination. It was not possible
to dynamically provision OpenStack Cinder volumes. This bug fix upgrades the
Gophercloud library in the OpenShift vendor directory. As a result, dynamic
provisioning of new Cinder volumes works as documented.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1490768[*BZ#1490768*])

* Previously, the default bootstrap policy allowed basic users to “get” storage
classes, but not “list” storage classes. Basic users would receive an error
message after issuing the `oc get storagelcass storageclass_name` command. This
bug fix modified the bootstrap policy. As a result, basic users can now issue
the `oc get storagelcass storageclass_name` command to receive specific storage
classes.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1449608[*BZ#1449608*])

* Previously, the lack of cloud provider configuration in the admission plug-in
caused persistent volume (PV) creation to fail when attempting to create the PV
in a zone other than master. This bug fix enables static PV provisioning in
multizone environments. As a result, users can now statically provision PVs in
zones other than master.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1454601[*BZ#1454601*])

* Previously, when creating storage classes, users could not specify the `fstype`.
This bug fix allows specifying the desired `fstype` when dynamically
provisioning volumes with storage classes. As a result, storage classes now
support file system configuration when creating dynamically provisioned volumes.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1469001[*BZ#1469001*])

* Previously, it was not possible to dynamically provision ScaleIO volumes if the
ScaleIO volume plug-in was not enabled. This bug fix enables the ScaleIO volume
plug-in in OpenShift Container Platform 3.7. As a result, it is now possible to
dynamically provision ScaleIO volumes.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1482274[*BZ#1482274*])

* When trying to mount/unmount, the FlexVolume plug-in’s file system previously
assumed that SELinux was supported. This assumption instructed docker to relabel
the volume. If the FlexVolume plugin's file system did not support file system
relabeling, the container using the FlexVolume would fail to start. This bug fix
added the `selinuxRelabel` capability, which allows FlexVolume plug-ins to
report in their `init` call. As a result, FlexVolume plug-ins can now be
configured to opt out of SELinux relabeling.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1484899[*BZ#1484899*])

*Templates*

* Previously, the service catalog could not provide authentication when invoking
the template service broker, which meant the template service broker API had to
allow calls from unauthenticated clients. This bug fix allows the service
catalog to use proper authentication to invoke the template service broker when
issuing the `oc cluster up` command to run both. As a result, the template
service broker APIs will now be secured, and will only be invokable by the
service catalog (or another client with appropriate credentials).
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1470628[*BZ#1470628*])

*Upgrade*

* Previously, the master node upgrade took more disk space than was initially
estimated. This caused the etcd member to report a `no space left on device`
error message. This bug fix increased the estimation of disk space needed before
the master node upgrade can start. As a result, a master node is properly
upgraded with enough disk space left after the upgrade finishes.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1489182[*BZ#1489182*])

* Previously, the upgrade playbooks incorrectly overwrote nondefault
`admissionConfig` parameters while setting specific values required of the
upgrade process. This bug fix removed this task as it is no longer necessary
after upgrading from OpenShift Container Platform 3.4 to OpenShift Container
Platform 3.5.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1486054[*BZ#1486054*])

* Previously, the etcd v3 data migrated prior to the first etcd v2 snapshot being
written. Without a v2 snapshot, the v3 data was not propagated properly to the
remaining etcd members, which resulted in a loss of some v3 data. This bug fix
checks to see if there is at least one v2 snapshot before etcd data migration
proceeds. As a result, etcd v3 data is now properly distributed among all etcd
members.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1501752[*BZ#1501752*])

* When trying to upgrade OpenShift Container Platform with dedicated etcd from
v3.6 to v3.7, the upgrade failed at the [Stop
atomic-openshift-master-controllers] task due to the wrong hosts group. This bug
fix corrected the host group to specify the masters group for controller
restart. As a result, the upgrade now succeeds.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1504515[*BZ#1504515*])

* Previously, if Ansible tags were used to evaluate some of the tasks in a set of
playbooks, the conditional for including a task file was not properly evaluated.
This caused the upgrade to fail. This bug fix allows the conditional to evaluate
properly and skip running the task.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1464025[*BZ#1464025*])

* Ansible playbooks now exit immediately when health checks fail. Previously, in
some instances, a host failure would not result in the playbook exiting during
failed health checks. This bug fix sets the `any_errors_fatal` play option to
`true`, ensuring that the playbook exits as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1484324[*BZ#1484324*])

* Upgrades that made use of system reboots to restart services may have failed if
 hosts took longer than 5 minutes to restart. This bug fix increases the timeout
 to 10 minutes. As a result, the shutdown process is now faster.
 (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1455836[*BZ#1455836*])

[[ocp-37-known-issues]]
== Known Issues

* When users are redirected to an external domain after successfully logging in,
users should only be redirected to specific URLs. This is a known issue and will
be fixed in {product-title} 3.9.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1525538[*BZ1525538*])

* The installer can not deploy system container-based installations when the
specified registry requires authentication credentials in order to pull the
required system container images. The fix for this depends on an update to the
`atomic` command, which will be updated after {product-title} 3.7 GA.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1505744[*BZ#1505744*])

* A {product-title} 3.7 master will return an unstructured response instead of
structured JSON when an action is forbidden. This is a known issue and will be
fixed in {product-title} 3.8.

* The volume snapshot Technology Preview feature may not be available to
non-administrator users by default due to API RBAC settings. When the volume
snapshot controller and provisioner are installed and run, the cluster
administrator needs to configure the API access to the VolumeSnapshot objects by
creating roles and cluster roles, then assigning them to the desired users or
user groups.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1502945[*BZ#1502945*])

* {product-title} is unable to list known health checks.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1509157[*BZ#1509157*])

* The current format of audit logs is difficult to consume. Some keys are
duplicates and some are misleading in that they match wrong keys in the
linux-audit dictionary.

==== Upgrading

To upgrade an existing {product-title} 3.6 or 3.7 cluster to this latest
release, use the automated upgrade playbook. See
xref:../upgrading/automated_upgrades.adoc#running-the-upgrade-playbook-directly[Performing
Automated In-place Cluster Upgrades] for instructions.

[[ocp-3-7-rhba-2017-3464-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* The `_source` was not disabled for metrics records being stored in Elasticsearch.
Therefore, the records were taking up much more resources (CPU, RAM, and disk
space) than necessary. Completely disable the  `_source` for `project.ovirt-metrics*`
records. With this bug fix, metrics records are much smaller and require fewer
resources.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1494912[*BZ#1494912*])

* `docker_image_availability` casted `openshift_docker_additional_registries` to a
list using the `list()` function. If a string was returned (only a single registry
added) the result would be the string split up by component characters. Force a
string result from get_var to be placed inside a list. If the result is anything
but a string, the original `list()` function is called on the result. With this
bug fix, docker_image_availability passes when it should.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1497274[*BZ#1497274*])

* The Ansible role accepted the CPU request and limit without additional
evaluation. Creating the resource would fail if the request was greater than the
limit. Evaluate the facts, inventory, and defaults and lower the request to the
limit value if needed. With this bug fix, the resource is created without issue.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1506073[*BZ#1506073*])

* Logging deployments were not maintaining the association of deployment
configuration (DC) to persistent volume claim (PVC) for Elasticsearch, causing
deployment failures. This bug fix addresses the regression introduced with 3.7
regarding reuse of the PVC that was previously specified within a DC.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1511110[*BZ#1511110*])

* When upgrading to a new version of logging, if the deployment does not use a
separate OPS logging cluster and there is no `@OUTPUT` label in the
*_fluent.conf_*, fluentd does not know how to route the operations logs. The
operations logs are not logged. The user will see no new operations
([x-]`.operations.*`) logs after the upgrade. Change the fluentd configuration to
correctly handle the case both with and without the `@OUTPUT` label, and for the
OPS and non-OPS cases. With this bug fix, operations logs flow uninterrupted
after upgrade.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1511719[*BZ#1511719*])

* The OpenShift Docker builder invoked the Docker build API without the
`ForceRmTemp` flag. Containers from failed builds remained on the node where the
build ran. These containers are not recognized by the kubelet for garbage
collection and are, therefore, accumulated until the node runs out of space.
This bug fix modified the Docker build API call from the OpenShift Docker
builder to force the removal of temporary containers. Failed containers no
longer remain on the node where a Docker build ran.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1512679[*BZ#1512679*])

* On slow network connections, the *Next* button could sometimes take several
 secrets to enable when opening the create from builder image dialog on the
 OpenShift web console catalog landing page with the service catalog enabled.
 This problem has been fixed, and the *Next* button should now be enabled
 immediately when the dialog is displayed.
 (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1512858[*BZ#1512858*])

* This bug fix brings new features to the GlusterFS deployments, specifically the
ability to provision gluster-block and gluster-s3 volumes.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1512978[*BZ#1512978*])

* The `assign-macvlan` pod annotation can now take the name of a network interface
rather than just `true` or `false`. The egress-routers can now be run on a
non-default network interface.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1513767[*BZ#1513767*])

* The configuration management for build defaults attempts to remove environment
variables that were previously defined but have since been removed from the
configuration. In situations where no environment variables have been configured,
this was failing because the `env` key did not exist. The process has now been
updated to skip the cleanup when the `env` key does not exist.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1515457[*BZ#1515457*])

* An error in the gluster-block installation playbooks is now corrected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1516530[*BZ#1516530*])

* Previously, deploying gluster-block storage would fail due to a missing file. The
file name has been corrected, ensuring proper deployment.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1517225[*BZ#1517225*])

* Jenkins images that were not backwards compatible to older clusters were pushed
as `latest`. Clusters referencing Jenkins master and slave images via the
`latest` tag picked up images that might not be compatible with the cluster, due
to the version of the `oc` client binary embedded in the Jenkins images. This
results in `oc` client operations failing when run from within the Jenkins (and
Jenkins slave) containers, against the cluster. With this bug fix, the `latest`
tag now points to a compatible image that will work with older clusters. Older
clusters referencing the `latest` Jenkins images now work properly.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1518501[*BZ#1518501*])

* Changes in the destination for the RPM installation of the list of plug-ins
included in the `openshift-jenkins-rhel7` image changed between versions 3.6 and
3.7. After an upgrade of the `openshift-jenkins-rhel76` image from 3.6 to 3.7 when
persistent volumes are maintained, Jenkins would not start successfully, as it
could not read in the needed plug-in *_jpi/hpi_* files. With this bug fix,
updates are made to the 3.7 `openshift-jenkins-rhel7` image so that additional
links are established so that the real *_jpi/hpi_* files can be found. Jenkins
in an {product-title} pod with PVs will now appear successfully after a 3.6 to
3.7 upgrade.

=== RHBA-2018:0113 - {product-title} 3.7.23 Bug Fix and Enhancement Update

Issued: 2018-01-22

{product-title} release 3.7.23 is now available. The packages and bug fixes
included in the update are documented in the
link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018:0113[RHBA-2018:0113] advisory.
The container images included in the update are provided by the

Space precluded documenting all of the bug fixes and images for this release in
the advisory. See the following sections for notes on upgrading and details on
the bug fixes, enhancements, and images included in this release.

[[ocp-3-7-23-rhba-2018-0113-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* A regression bug was reported whereby source-to-image builds would fail if the
source repository filesystem contained a broken symlink (pointing to a
non-existent item). This was resolved with this bug fix.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1519822[*BZ#1519822*])

* Categories like *all* were moved to the server, but some of them were only moved
after the upstream cut for the rebase, causing an incomplete list of resources.
Therefore, some resources could not be found in `oc get all` and some other `oc
get` calls. With this bug fix, the remaining upstream commits were picked to
include all needed resources and `oc get all` and the other problematic calls
were fixed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1515878[*BZ#1515878*])

* Node selectors were incorrectly set on template service broker daemonset object.
Consequently, the looping failed the deployment of template service broker pods
and there was excessive CPU usage on master and nodes. The node selectors are
now set correctly on the template service broker daemonset object and the
template service broker pods now deploy correctly.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1524219[*BZ#1524219*])

* Fluentd fails to properly process messages when it is unable to determine the
namespace and pod UUIDs.The logging pipeline outputs a lot of messages and
sometimes blocks log flow to Elasticsearch. Check for the missing fields and
orphan the record if needed. With this bug fix, logs continue to flow and
orphaned records end up in an orphaned namespace.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1494612[*BZ#1494612*])

* Elasticsearch clusters that take a long time recovering data do not reach the
*YELLOW* state fast enough. The  {product-title} cluster restarts the pod
because the readiness probe fails, which starts the Elasticsearch node recovery
again. Check only for the Elasticsearch cluster to be listening on the desired
port. The {product-title} cluster does not terminate the Elasticsearch node
early, which allows it to complete its recovery. The cluster may be in the *RED*
state at this time, but is able to accept queries and writes.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1510697[*BZ#1510697*])

* When trying to alias an index that does not exist, the bulk alias operation
failed. Only alias *_.operations_* if there is at least one *_.operations_*
index. As a result, there will be an alias for all indices.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1519705[*BZ#1519705*])

* The *remote-syslog* plug-in in fluentd takes a configuration parameter `tag_key`
to use the field specified in `tag_key` from the record to set the syslog key.
When a field specified in `tag_key` does not exist, it caused a Ruby exception,
which was not caught. With this bug fix,  the field no longer exists and
`tag_key` is ignored and the default tag is used.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1519213[*BZ#1519213*])

* There was a logic error in the fluentd startup script. When an ops cluster was
first disabled then enabled, the proper ops configuration file was not enabled.
As a result, Sub-configuration files starting with `output-ops-extra-` did not
have a chance to be called from the ops configuration file. The logic error  s
now fixed When an ops cluster is first disabled then enabled, the proper ops
configuration file is enabled and its sub-configuration files are also enabled.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1519679[*BZ#1519679*])

* The annotation to identify the proper Kibana instance to use for ops namespaces
was being set regardless of if an ops logging cluster is used or not. Users were
directed to non-existent service from the web console when trying to view
operations logs. For existing deployments, manually run `oc annotate ns
$NAMESPACE  openshift.io/logging.ui.hostname-` for each affected namespace. New
deployments will only have this annotation set by the installer if
the `openshift_logging_use_ops` variable is set to `true`. With this bug fix,
users will be directed to the correct version of Kibana when viewing ops logs
from the web console.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1519808[*BZ#1519808*])

* Previously, when importing a template as YAML in the web console, then clicking
*Back* in the wizard, the *Next* button would stop working. The problem has been
fixed so that the *Next* button works correctly after clicking *Back* in the
*Import YAML* dialog.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1526215[*BZ#1526215*])

* The Kubernetes resource quota controller had a fatal a race condition.
Therefore, the master controller process occasionally crashes, writes a stack
dump, and restarts. With this bug fix,  the race condition is resolved and the
crash no longer occurs.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1519277[*BZ#1519277*])

* When a Network Egress DNS policy was used, a bug may have prevented further
 correct operation of the proxy, resulting in new pods not handling service
 requests. That bug is fixed and Egress DNS policies can now be used without
 triggering this bug.
 (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1502602[*BZ#1502602*])

* A bug in the node container garbage collection and network setup prevented pod
sandboxes from being properly garbage collected. Nodes could exhaust the
available pool of pod IP addresses, especially if they are restarted and/or
containers were removed while the node was not running. Nodes now properly
garbage collect and tear down pod sandboxes, ensuring that IP addresses are
released to the pool for subsequent re-use. Newly installed nodes should no
longer experience IP address exhaustion due to pod sandbox teardown errors.
Upgraded nodes should remove all files in
*_/var/lib/cni/networks/openshift-sdn/_* during the upgrade, or after upgrade
when no pods are running on the node.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1516782[*BZ#1516782*])

* This bug fix corrects an interaction between runc and systemd where the sandbox
creation fails when the pod specifies CPU limit in 1000s of millicores and the
last digit is not 0.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1509467[*BZ#1509467*])

* This bug fix corrects an issue where `oc logs` exits with error *unexpected
stream type*.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1521026[*BZ#1521026*])

* When running the etcd v2 to v3 migration playbooks as included in the
{product-title} 3.7 release, the playbooks incorrectly assumed that all services
were HA services (`atomic-openshift-master-api` and
`atomic-openshift-master-controllers` rather than `atomic-openshift-master`),
which is the norm on version 3.7. However, the migration playbooks would be
executed prior to upgrading to version 3.7, so this was incorrect. The migration
playbooks have been updated to start and stop the correct services ensuring
proper migration.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1523814[*BZ#1523814*])

[[ocp-3-7-23-rhba-2018-0113-enhancements]]
==== Enhancements

* Elasticsearch `deploymentconfigs` are now modified to disable {product-title}
rollback behavior. Upgrades of the logging stack that do not result in the
readiness probe succeeding are rolled back to the last previous successful
deployment.  This can result in the deployed instances being out-of-date with
their configuration and old images. This change will make it so the deployments
will not be rolled back and operators can manually intervene without the image
and configuration mismatches.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1519622[*BZ#1519622*])

* An *_.operations_* index-mapping in a non-ops Elasticsearch cluster is no longer
displayed because operations indices will never exist in a non-ops Elasticsearch
cluster.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1519706[*BZ#1519706*])

=== RHBA-2018:0636 - {product-title} 3.7.42-2 Bug Fix and Enhancement Update

Issued: 2018-04-05

{product-title} release 3.7.42-2 is now available. The packages and bug fixes
included in the update are documented in the
link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018:0636[RHBA-2018:0636] advisory.
The list of container images included in the update are documented in
link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018:0637[RHBA-2018:0637] advisory.

Space precluded documenting all of the bug fixes for this release in
the advisory. See the following sections for notes on upgrading and details on
the bug fixes and enhancements included in this release.

[[ocp-3-7-42-2-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* When a pod is admitted by "nonroot" SCC, the `securityContext.runAsUser`
parameter is not set, and the user is able to provide an arbitrary image. This
made it possible to escalate permissions within a container. This bug fixes the
check in the kubelet, and now such a container will fail during its creation and
will not run.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1518889[*BZ#1518889*])

* Image validation used to validate old image objects, and the image signature
import controller used to generate such an image. This could cause invalid
images to be pushed to etcd. This bug fix changes the validation to validate new
image objects and introduces logic to fix some invalid images. As a result, the
controller no longer generates invalid images and it is no longer possible to
upload an invalid image object.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1557607[*BZ#1557607*])

* With the image registry, concurrent writes to the cache could cause a panic to
occur. This bug fix protects writes to the cache with mutex. As a result, the
cache is safe to use concurrently.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1549917[*BZ#1549917*])

* Previously, when scaling up containerized masters, the registered
`install_result` was not available when the install task was skipped for
containerized hosts, causing scale up to fail. This bug fix defaults the value
so that scale up can succeed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1511357[*BZ#1511357*])

* The `openshift-ansible docker_image_availability` check did not utilize the
`osm_use_cockpit=false` variable. This check could fail because the
*registry-console* (Cockpit) image was not available, even if it would never be
used. The check now consults this variable. As a result, if
`osm_use_cockpit=false` is set, then the *openshift-ansible*
`docker_image_availability` check will not report a missing *registry-console*
image. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1511616[*BZ#1511616*])

* Amazon EC2 C5 instances use different identifiers for `bios_vendor`. Code which
uses this information for identifying the host as an AWS instance was not being
run. This bug fix adds logic to use the new `bios_vendor` identifier. As a
result, AWS C5 instances are properly identified by *openshift-ansible* code.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1538781[*BZ#1538781*])

* The *_haproxy.cfg_* template in the *load-balancer* role was not updated to
reflect changes in new versions of HAProxy, causing the service to fail to
start. This bug fix updates the configuration file template to work for newer
versions of HAProxy.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1538789[*BZ#1538789*])

* In order for the *_adhoc.yml_* playbook to list health checks, they are all
loaded, and one failed to load in that environment. Listing health checks failed
with an error. This bug fix adjusts the problematic health check, and as a
result the listing works as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1509157[*BZ#1509157*])

* Single host failures for installing packages were not resulting in a failed
playbook run. This caused the playbook to continue and fail at a later point.
This fix adds a play directive to cause the playbook to fail immediately if
there are any host failures. As a result, if package installation fails for any
host, the playbook will mpw fail immediately.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1512810[*BZ#1512810*])

* The Jenkins image stream tags have been updated to allow for {product-title}
version-specific image streams.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1525659[*BZ#1525659*])

* An error message on etcd group validation has been updated to reflect the
required configurations to better inform the user of the failure state.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1538795[*BZ#1538795*])

* A variable defined in an inventory file was being interpreted as a string, not a
bool. This caused tasks to not be conditionally run as expected. This bug fix
casts the string to a bool for a proper conditional check, and as a result tasks
run as expected based on the inventory variable setting.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1538816[*BZ#1538816*])

* The `OPTIONS` value in the *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-node_* file now
works properly when multiple options are specified with containerized
installations.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1539094[*BZ#1539094*])

* When the [x-]`openshift_management_flavor*` variable was set in *_vars/main.yml_*,
the variable was not dependent on the user inventory variable for overriding the
deployment type. This bug fix updates the [x-]`openshift_management_flavor*` logic
to be based on `openshift_management_app_template` from the inventory file. As a
result, the requested management template can be successfully deployed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1540246[*BZ#1540246*])

* Alternative names in certificates were not being properly parsed. Alternatives
with `email:` were being added as additional host names. This bug fix updates
the logic to only add alternative names which begin with `DNS:`. As a result,
`namedCertificates` are properly parsed and updated.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1538896[*BZ#1538896*])

* The *docker_image_availability* check did not take into account variables that
specify a proxy to be used for pulling container images. The check could
incorrectly report failure looking for images that are only available via proxy.
This bug fix ensures the check now uses a proxy for looking up images if
specified in the Ansible variables. The check should accurately report whether
the necessary images are available. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1539146[*BZ#1539146*])

* The *docker* daemon was incorrectly restarted when redeploying node
certificates. This is only necessary when deploying a new CA and can safely be
skipped, which ensures that running pods are not restarted when updating node
certificates.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1542162[*BZ#1542162*])

* A security fix to *openshift-elasticsearch-plugin* caused metrics requests to be
rejected because the *oauth-proxy* does not pass the bearer token. This bug fix
modifies the plug-in to accept a user name and password from the *oauth-proxy*
and deploy with a randomly-generated password. As a result, data and metrics are
correctly secured and able to be retrieved based on authorization.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1510320[*BZ#1510320*])

* As part of an enhancement, configuration triggers are no longer used for
Elasticsearch (ES), and it instead rolls out in a handler. The handler was
watching the old ES pod to see if the ES cluster was green or yellow.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1533313[*BZ#1533313*])

* Attempting to use an Ansible 2.4 feature in Ansible 2.3 caused the maximum
recursion depth to be exceeded in cmp errors. This bug fix makes sure to use the
right Ansible features with the correct version of Ansible. As a result, `mux`
can be installed correctly with Ansible.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1540893[*BZ#1540893*])

* A task assumed the `oc` binary was in the usable path of Ansible, causing the
task to fail when the binary was not found. This bug fix modifies the task to
allow the binary to be provided as an Ansible fact. As a result, the task
completes successfully.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1541403[*BZ#1541403*])

* Messages for which the unique namespace ID could not be determined could not be
properly indexed. Messages could be lost and the error message appears in the
logs. This bug fix modifies the cache algorithm to provide the necessary data or
default the value to `orphaned`. As a result, the error message is resolved and
messages are stored in an `orphaned` index when a unique namespace ID can not be
determined.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1493022[*BZ#1493022*])

* The multi-tenancy plug-in in Elasticsearch was inadvertently changed, while
fixing another bug, not to look up projects for the user upon every login. This
caused the list of projects to not be displayed properly. This bug fix changes
the multi-tenancy plug-in in Elasticsearch back to look up projects for the user
upon every login. As a result, the list of projects is displayed properly.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1511432[*BZ#1511432*])

* Fluentd was adding the level field with a value of `3` or `6`, overwriting any
existing level field. The level field set by the application was being removed,
and the `3` or `6` value was not useful. With this bug fix, if there is already
a `level` field in the record, then see if it is a "close" match to one of the
canonical `level` field values. For example, if `level` is `CRITICAL`, convert
to `crit`; if level is `WARN`, convert to `warning`. Otherwise, if it cannot be
used directly or normalized, convert it to its string representation (ruby
`to_s` method) and store the string value in the `level` field. As a result, if
the record already has a level field, the value is normalized or preserved,
otherwise, a value like `info` or `err` is used.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1515448[*BZ#1515448*])

* A script that parsed user-supplied configuration produced an incorrect regular
expression. This caused no impact on users; the non-escaped period in the
regular expression matched the period in the project name as "any character".
This bug fix properly escapes characters that should not be expanded as special
characters in regular expressions. For example, regular expressions produced
after applying this patch would look like [x-]`^\.operations\..*$` instead of
`.operations.`
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1524644[*BZ#1524644*])

* The load on the Elasticsearch cluster is great enough to cause a request from
Kibana to timeout before it is able to get a response. This causes no results to
be returned and Kibana to display an error. This bug fix modifies the Kibana
image to allow configuration of the request timeout. As a result, Kibana is able
to retrieve data from Elasticsearch.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1538171[*BZ#1538171*])

* When creating an Elasticsearch (ES) cluster of size 3+, the node quorum and
recovery settings prevent the first ES node from ever reaching a ready and green
state in time during a fresh install. This causes the playbook to time out
waiting for the first ES node to be ready. With this bug fix, when new ES nodes
are created, OpenShift no longer waits for them to be healthy since the recovery
settings and quorum would have changed and will need all nodes to be running at
the same time. As a result, the playbook no longer times out when creating large
clusters of ES nodes.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1544243[*BZ#1544243*])

* The Kibana container image was not built with the required header image. This
bug fix replaces the OpenShift Origin header image with the OpenShift Container
Platform header image. As a result, the Kibana page displays the desired header.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1547263[*BZ#1547263*])

* The link generation code assumes all project logs are written to indices that
have a common naming pattern. This can cause users to be linked to non-existent
indices. With this bug fix, project logs that will be archived to different
indices are annotated with the required information to properly build the link.
As a result, users are routed using a link that will query the data store
correctly and return data.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1547348[*BZ#1547348*])

* Previously, the ClusterResourceOverride admission controller configuration was
not passed through to the web console. This meant that the web console was
showing fields for resource requests and limits in its forms that were
calculated values and should have been hidden in the UI. The problem has been
fixed, and the calculated request and limit fields are correctly hidden in the
web console.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1501164[*BZ#1501164*])

* On slow network connections, the Next button could sometimes take several
secrets to enable when opening the create from builder image dialog on the
OpenShift web console catalog landing page with the service catalog enabled.
This problem has been fixed, and the Next button should now be enabled
immediately when the dialog is displayed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1512858[*BZ#1512858*])

* Previously, the sample Git reference and context dir for building images sample
repositories was not used when clicking the "Try Sample Repository" link in the
web console add to project dialog. The sample reference and context dir are now
properly set in the build config that is created when the sample is used.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1519096[*BZ#1519096*])

* Previously, provisioned services that reference service classes or service plans
that do not exist would not display correctly in the web console overview. This
problem has been fixed. The web console now shows provisioned services even when
its referenced service class doesn't exist.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1532182[*BZ#1532182*])

* Previously, image stream tag aliases would not show up in the add to project
dialog version dropdown when the alias was specified in "name:tag" format in the
`from.name` property. The `oc tag --alias` uses this format. The web console now
handles aliases in this format correctly, and they will show up as an alias in
the version dropdown with the tag they reference.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1518497[*BZ#1518497*])

* Previously, the web console would not correctly update a route host name in the
route editor for users with authority to update custom hosts. This problem has
been fixed, and the web console now correctly applies the changes when changing
a route's host name.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1540783[*BZ#1540783*])

* Use of javascript Array/String methods not supported by IE11 (Array.find,
Array.findIndex, String.startsWith, String.endsWith) caused an error that
prevents some A-MQ pages to show content when the user clicks on a tree node.
This bug fix replaces the unsupported methods with the Lodash library equivalent
methods. As a result, A-MQ pages show their content as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1543467[*BZ#1543467*])

* Previously, when the service catalog was installed and then uninstalled using
the Ansible playbooks, the web console still incorrectly showed the *Provisioned Services* menu item, which did not load any content when clicked. The bug is now
fixed and the web console no longer shows the *Provisioned Services* menu after
uninstalling the service catalog.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1549097[*BZ#1549097*])

* The default *ui-select* selection field had a lower z-index value than the
project bar. The *add to project* selection could be partially hidden at small
browser viewport size because it was beneath the project bar. With this bug fix,
the *ui-select* dropdown field a z-index was made 1 greater than the project
bar. The *select* field will now appear over the project bar if needed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1479114[*BZ#1479114*])

* An {product-title} node was not waiting long enough for the VNID while master
assigned VNID. It could take a while to propagate to the node, resulting in
failed pod creation. With this bug fix, the timeout increased  from 1 to 5
seconds for fetching VNID on the node and pod creation succeeds.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1540606[*BZ#1540606*])

* When using the "static per-project egress IPs" feature, egress IPs may stop
working in some circumstances if an egress IP is moved from one project to
another, or from one node to another. Additionally, if the same egress IP is
assigned to two different projects, or two different nodes, then it may not work
correctly even after the duplicate assignment is removed. This bug fix addresses
these issues and static per-project egress IPs now works more reliably.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1553297[*BZ#1553297*])

* Certain initialization code was only run when doing a full SDN setup, and not
when {product-title} was restarted and found the SDN was already up and running.
If the *atomic-openshift-node* service was restarted, that node would be unable
to create new per-project static egress IPs (`HostSubnet.EgressIPs`). The egress
IP initialization code is now run in all circumstances. Per-project static
egress IPs work correctly, even after a node restart.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1535658[*BZ#1535658*])

* In some circumstances, iptables rules could become reordered in a way that would
cause the "per-project static IP address" feature to stop working for some IP
addresses. (For most users, egress IP addresses that ended with an even number
would continue to work, but egress IP addresses ending with an odd number would
fail.) External traffic from pods in a project that was supposed to use a
per-project static IP address would end up using the normal node IP address
instead. The iptables rules have been changed so that they now have the expected
effect even when they get reordered. With this bug fix, the per-project static
egress IP feature now works reliably.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1540611[*BZ#1540611*])

* In some circumstances, nodes were apparently receiving a duplicate out-of-order
HostSubnet "deleted" event from the master. When processing the duplicate event,
the node could end up deleting OVS flows corresponding to an active node,
causing pods on the two nodes to be unable to communicate with each other. This
was most noticeable when it happened to a node hosting the registry. With this
bug fix, the HostSubnet event-processing code will now notice that the event is
a duplicate and ignore it. As a result, OVS flows are not deleted, and pods can
communicate.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1546170[*BZ#1546170*])

* Previously, a "transport endpoint is not connected" error occurred when deleting
projects with pods using CNS backed PVs. This bug fix corrects the issue.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1546156[*BZ#1546156*])

* When using the vSphere cloud provider, the `InternalIP` information was not
populated for nodes. This would cause issues with Heapster since it uses the
`InternalIP` for gathering metrics. With this bug fix, the `InternalIP`
information is now populated and the issues are resolved.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1527315[*BZ#1527315*])

* The installer has been modified to turn on API aggregation for upgrades to
{product-title} 3.7, which is a required dependency for service catalog to work
properly.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1523298[*BZ#1523298*])

* Previously, the Ansible installer was not updating the  API service definition
with newly generated certificate data. Also, the service catalog API  server was
not being restarted to pick up the new certificates. Using mismatched CAs causes
x509 errors in the API server logs and, with this bug fix, is now corrected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1523625[*BZ#1523625*])

* {product-title} 3.7 upgrades were incorrectly using an old default etcd port
value of `4001`. This bug fix modifies the value to the number, `2379`.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1535206[*BZ#1535206*])

* Unbinding a template service instance throws an error if the template service
instance was deleted. It becomes impossible to unbind a service instance if the
template service instance was manually deleted, including if the project
containing the TSI was deleted. The template service broker will return
*success/gone* in cases where the unbind refers to a non-existent template
service instance. With this bug fix, the unbind can proceed even if the TSI no
longer exists.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1543044[*BZ#1543044*])

* The broker overwrote the bind credentials on subsequent bind endpoint calls,
causing bind credentials to be saved incorrectly. With this bug fix, bind
credentials are now saved for every call.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1501512[*BZ#1501512*])

* The update strategy in the controller manager template was incorrectly set.
Previously, any parameters that were modified in the controller manager template
would fail to cause the pod to redeploy with the updated changes. With this bug
fix, the issue is corrected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1537227[*BZ#1537227*])

* {product-title} checked mounted NFS volumes with `squash` (running as root).
Permissions of {product-title} (running as root) were squashed to user `nobody`,
which did not have permissions to access mounted NFS volumes. As a result,
{product-title} checks failed and NFS volumes were not unmounted.
{product-title} does not access mounted NFS volumes at all and checks for mounts
by parsing the *_/proc_* filesystem. With this bug fix, NFS volumes with the
root `squash` option are unmounted.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1536019[*BZ#1536019*])

* Incorrect batch size calculations in Ansible 2.4.1 would cause playbooks to fail
when using `max_fail_percentage`. The batch calculations were updated in
Ansible 2.4.2 to correctly account for failures in each batch.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1538807[*BZ#1538807*])

* During the control plane upgrade, etcd is now upgraded to etcd 3.2.x.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1495486[*BZ#1495486*])

[[ocp-3-7-42-2-enhancements]]
==== Enhancements

* To avoid the unplanned restart of Elasticsearch pods, which could cause loss of
data, Elasticsearch deployment configurations are now created without
configuration change triggers. When a configuration change is made to an
Elasticsearch deployment configuration, it is no longer automatically rolled
out, and can instead be done manually at a scheduled time. See
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#manual-elasticsearch-rollouts[Manual Elasticsearch Rollouts] for steps on how to do so.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1498989[*BZ#1498989*])

* Regular expressions are now allowed in Curator settings. A special tag can be
used in Curator settings to specify custom regular expressions.

the advisory. See the following sections for notes on upgrading and details on
the bug fixes and enhancements included in this release.

[[ocp-3-7-46-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* Previously, the value of `openshift_master_extension_scripts` was not preserved
during installations when the service catalog was enabled. This bug fix ensures
that the scripts in `openshift_master_extension_scripts` are now correctly set
during installation.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1541129[*BZ#1541129*])

* When verifying various API endpoints, a timeout was not set. This meant that the
verification would wait 120 seconds for the connection to fail and then wait the
prescribed delay before retrying. This would have led to certain tasks waiting
up to two hours rather than moving forward with the installation. With this bug
fix, a connection timeout of two seconds has now been set.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1556679[*BZ#1556679*])

* The EFS Provisioner image tag was incorrectly set to match the tag of all other
OpenShift Container Platform images. This has been updated and now installations
will pull from the `latest` image tag, which should be compatible with all
versions of OpenShift Container Platform.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1566300[*BZ#1566300*])

* The number of fluentd outputs is computed in the startup script run.sh. When the
forward plug-in was configured, it was not correctly counted. This caused a
number of output to be missed when the forward plug-in was configured. The
number of output is used for calculating the file buffer size and the size grew
larger than expected. This bug fix updates the logic of the calculation to
include the forward plug-in case. As a result, the correct output number then
the correct file buffer size is now derived when the forward plug-in is
configured.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1569544[*BZ#1569544*])

* The default write operation for fluentd to Elasticsearch is index. Writes can
trigger unnecessary `delete` operations for Elasticsearch causing extra load
that affects performance. This bug fix utilizes the `create` operation which
will avoid 'delete' when duplicates are introduced.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1568415[*BZ#1568415*])

* Due to incorrect management of OVS flows, if two nodes rebooted and swapped IP
addresses when they came back up, then other nodes might become unable to send
traffic to pods on one or both of those nodes. With this bug fix, the code that
manages OVS flows is now more careful to make the correct changes in cases of
node IP reassignment. As a result, pod-to-pod traffic should continue to work
correctly even after nodes swap IP addresses.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1570396[*BZ#1570396*])

* Updating egress policy required blocking outgoing traffic, patching OVS flows,
and then re-enabling traffic. However, the OVS flow generation for DNS names was
slow, resulting in a few seconds egress traffic downtime, which may not be
acceptable. This bug fix changes update egress policy handling to pre-populate
all new OVS flows before blocking the outgoing traffic. As a result, the
downtime during egress policy updates is now reduced.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1571433[*BZ#1571433*])

* When using per-namespace static egress IPs, all external traffic is routed
through the egress IP. "External" means all traffic which is not directed to
another pod, and so includes traffic from the pod to the pod's node. When pods
are told to use the node's IP address for DNS, and the pod is using a static
egress IP, then DNS traffic will be routed to the egress node first, and then
back to the original node, which might be configured to not accept DNS requests
from other hosts, causing the pod to be unable to resolve DNS. With this bug
fix, pod-to-node DNS requests now bypass the egress IP and go directly to the
node, and as a result DNS now works as expected.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1570400[*BZ#1570400*])

* This update fixes an issue where a node can stop reporting status if the
connection to the Azure API is terminated uncleanly, resulting in a long timeout
before the connection is re-established, blocking the status update loop.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1573122[*BZ#1573122*])

* Resources consumed by pods whose node is unreachable or have past their
termination grace period are no longer counted against quota.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1455743[*BZ#1455743*])

[[ocp-3-7-46-enhancements]]
==== Enhancements

* You may now define a set of hooks to run arbitrary tasks during the node upgrade
process. To implement these hooks, set `openshift_node_upgrade_pre_hook`,
`openshift_node_upgrade_hook`, or `openshift_node_upgrade_post_hook` to the path
of the task file you wish to execute. The `openshift_node_upgrade_pre_hook` hook
is executed after draining the node and before it has been upgraded. The
`openshift_node_upgrade_hook` hook is executed after the node has been drained
and packages updated but before it is marked schedulable again. The
`openshift_node_upgrade_post_hook` hook is executed after the node has been
marked schedulable immediately before moving on to other nodes.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1572798[*BZ#1572798*])

* Previously, OpenShift Container Platform defaulted the indexing request timeout
for fluentd to 600 seconds, or about 10 minutes. In certain situations, this
timeout was not long enough. If we make this essentially infinite, we'll avoid
fluentd pods re-submitting requests unnecessarily. With this enhancement, the
fluentd timeout is now 2147483648 and will wait for a very long time before
resubmitting a request to Elasticsearch due to a timeout failure. As a result,
this avoids fluentd pods being resubmitted unnecessarily.

[[ocp-3-7-52-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* Jenkins `no_proxy` processing could not handle suffixes like `".svc"`. As a
result, communication between a Jenkins k8s agent pod and the Jenkins
master would attempt to go through a configured http_proxy and fail.
With this bug fix, the OpenShift Container Platform jenkins agent images
are updated to automatically include the jenkins master and jnlp hosts in
the `no_proxy` list. The Jenkins limitation for `no_proxy` processing is now
circumvented.

some situations.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1578422[*BZ#1578422*])

==== Bug Fixes

* When performing pullthrough, even when the internal registry is the source of the image, the registry will attempt to pull from itself if a manifest cannot be found. The pullthrough attempt fails both because the manifest does not exist and potentially because the registry is not secured. This bug fix adds a check to prevent attempting manifest pullthrough when the image source is the internal registry. As result, pullthrough will not be attempted and the failure will not occur. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1557399[*BZ#1557399*])

* In certain cases, an existing etcd installation may not have updated configuration variables, causing services to fail. This bug fix ensures the etcd.conf file is verified during upgrades to ensure all variables are set as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1563376[*BZ#1563376*])

* When OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 3.7 introduced a second container in the Elasticsearch pod, the related role did not account for the fact that upgrading to 3.7 would mean there was only one container. This caused the playbook run to fail because it does not have a second container. This bug fix expands the check to also see if there is more than one container in the pod to account for upgrades from pre-3.7 to 3.7. As a result, the playbook is able to run to completion when upgrading from 3.6 to 3.7. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1557044[*BZ#1557044*])

* Certain upgrade tasks used the default kubeconfig file, which may have been updated by the administrator in such a way that it prevented upgrade success. With this bug fix, the upgrade playbooks now use an administrator-specific kubeconfig file which is not prone to being altered. As a result, this now ensures proper upgrade process. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1576527[*BZ#1576527*])

* Certain incoming data to Elasticsearch has a field `record["event"]` that is a String value and not the Hash value expected by the `transform_eventrouter` code. This caused the code to throw an error and fluentd to emit an error like:
+
----
    error_class=NoMethodError error="undefined method `key?' for \"request\":String"
----
+
This bug fix changes the `transform_eventrouter` code to only process the `record["event"]` field if it is a Hash. As a result, records can flow through to Elasticsearch again. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1588827[*BZ#1588827*]))

* Curator gave up waiting for Elasticsearch to become ready after 60 seconds, causing Curator to exit with an error status. With this bug fix, Curator waits for Elasticsearch with no time limit; exponential wait is capped at 300 seconds. As a result, Curator is passivated if Elasticsearch is not reachable, instead of crashing. Elasticsearch status is polled every x seconds. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1557483[*BZ#1557483*])

* Previously, clicking "Back" from the Template Configuration step in the web console "Import YAML" wizard would prevent users from clicking "Next" again. The problem has been fixed, and the "Next" button works properly in this wizard now after clicking "Back". (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1530507[*BZ#1530507*])

* Network policy objects cannot be upgraded between OCP 3.7.z versions before 3.7.23. The documentation has been changed to explain how to work around the problem, and the error has been fixed in 3.7.23. As a result, you can now upgrade as expected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1570777[*BZ#1570777*])

* The APB tooling was not looking in the *openshift-ansible-service-broker* namespace for the broker route, and the `--broker` flag misbehaved with improper suffixes. This caused commands like `apb list` to not behave as expected. This bug fix backports some newer fixes to OCP 3.7 so that the tooling automatically tries to find the correct resources even if the user does not provide all of the information. As a result, the `apb list` command works, even without the `--broker` flag.
