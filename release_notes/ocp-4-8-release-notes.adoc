[id="ocp-4-8-about-this-release"]
== About this release

// TODO: Update k8s link once there is a version-specific URL for the Kubernetes release
{product-title} (link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2021:1234[RHBA-2021:1234]) is now available. This release uses link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/[Kubernetes 1.21] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

//Red Hat did not publicly release {product-title} 4.8.0 as the GA version and, instead, is releasing {product-title} 4.8.z as the GA version.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift. The {cloud-redhat-com} application for {product-title} allows you to deploy OpenShift clusters to either on-premise or cloud environments.

{product-title} {product-version} is supported on {op-system-base-full} 7.9 or later, as well as on {op-system-first} 4.8.

You must use {op-system} machines for the control plane, and you can use either {op-system} or {op-system-base-full} 7.9 or later for compute machines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because only {op-system-base} 7.9 or later is supported for compute machines, you must not upgrade the {op-system-base} compute machines to {op-system-base} 8.
====

//{product-title} 4.6 is an Extended Update Support (EUS) release. More information on Red Hat OpenShift EUS is available in link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#ocp4_phases[OpenShift Life Cycle] and link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift-eus[OpenShift EUS Overview].

With the release of {product-title} 4.8, version 4.5 is now end of life. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy].

[id="ocp-4-8-inclusive-language"]
== Making open source more inclusive

Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language[Red Hat CTO Chris Wrightâ€™s message].

[id="ocp-4-8-new-features-and-enhancements"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

[id="ocp-4-8-rhcos"]
=== {op-system-first}

[id="ocp-4-8-rhcos-rhel-8-4-packages"]
==== {op-system} now supports RHEL 8.4

{op-system} is now using {op-system-base-full} 8.4 packages. This enables you to have the latest fixes, features, and enhancements, as well as the latest hardware support and driver updates. {product-title} 4.7 is currently using {op-system-base} 8.3 packages and will upgrade to {op-system-base} 8.4 in a future update. {product-title} 4.6 is an Extended Update Support (EUS) release that will continue to use {op-system-base} 8.2 EUS packages for the entirety of its lifecycle.

[id="ocp-4-8-stream-metadata"]
==== Using stream metadata for improved boot image automation

Stream metadata provides a standardized JSON format for injecting metadata into the cluster during {product-title} installation. For improved automation, the new `openshift-install coreos print-stream-json` command provides a method for printing stream metadata in a scriptable, machine-readable format.

For user-provisioned installations, the `openshift-install` binary contains references to the version of {op-system} boot images that are tested for use with {product-title}, such as the AWS AMI. You can now parse the stream metadata from a Go program by using the official `stream-metadata-go` library at https://github.com/coreos/stream-metadata-go.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-user-infra.adoc#installation-aws-ami-stream-metadata_installing-aws-user-infra[Accessing {op-system} AMIs with stream metadata].

[id="ocp-4-8-rhcos-butane"]
==== Butane config transpiler simplifies creation of machine configs

{product-title} now includes the Butane config transpiler to assist with producing and validating machine configs. Documentation now recommends using Butane to create machine configs for LUKS disk encryption, boot disk mirroring, and custom kernel modules.

For more information, see xref:../installing/install_config/installing-customizing.adoc#installation-special-config-butane_installing-customizing[Creating machine configs with Butane].

[id="ocp-4-8-rhcos-chrony-default"]
==== Change to custom chrony.conf default on cloud platforms

If a cloud administrator has already set a custom `/etc/chrony.conf` configuration, {op-system} no longer sets the `PEERNTP=no` option by default on cloud platforms. Otherwise, the `PEERNTP=no` option is still set by default. See link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1924869[BZ#1924869] for more information.

[id="ocp-4-8-installation-and-upgrade"]
=== Installation and upgrade

[id="ocp-4-8-installation-azure-empty-rg"]
==== Installing a cluster to an existing, empty resource group on Azure

You can now define an already existing resource group to install your cluster to on Azure by defining the `platform.azure.resourceGroupName` field in the `install-config.yaml` file. This resource group must be empty and only used for a single cluster; the cluster components assume ownership of all resources in the resource group.

If you limit the service principal scope of the installation program to this resource group, you must ensure all other resources used by the installation program in your environment have the necessary permissions, such as the public DNS zone and virtual network. Destroying the cluster using the installation program deletes the user-defined resource group.

[id="ocp-4-8-installation-existing-iam-roles-aws"]
==== Using existing IAM roles for clusters on AWS

You can now define a pre-existing Amazon Web Services (AWS) IAM role for your machine instance profiles by setting the `compute.platform.aws.iamRole` and `controlPlane.platform.aws.iamRole` fields in the `install-config.yaml` file. This allows you to do the following for your IAM roles:

* Match naming schemes
* Include predefined permissions boundaries

[id="ocp-4-8-installation-pre-existing-hosted-zones-aws"]
==== Using pre-existing Route53 hosted private zones on AWS

You can now define an existing Route 53 private hosted zone for your cluster by setting the `platform.aws.hostedZone` field in the `install-config.yaml` file. You can only use a pre-existing hosted zone when also supplying your own VPC.

[id="ocp-4-8-installation-increase-gcp-subnets-within-machine-cidr"]
==== Increasing the size of GCP subnets within the machine CIDR

The {product-title} installation program for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) now creates subnets as large as possible within the machine CIDR. This allows the cluster to use a machine CIDR appropriately sized to accommodate the number of nodes in the cluster.

[id="ocp-4-8-improved-upgrade-duration"]
==== Improved upgrade duration

With this release, the upgrade duration for cluster Operators that deploy daemon sets to all nodes is significantly reduced. For example, the upgrade duration of a 250-node test cluster is reduced from 7.5 hours to 1.5 hours, resulting in upgrade duration scaling of less than one minute per additional node.

[NOTE]
====
This change does not affect machine config pool rollout duration.
====

[id="ocp-4-8-mco-upgrade-complete"]
==== MCO waits for all machine config pools to update before reporting the update is complete

When updating, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) now reports an `Upgradeable=False` status to the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) if any machine config pool has not completed updating. This status blocks future minor updates, but does not block future patch updates, or the current update. Previously, the MCO reported the `Upgradeable` status based only on the state of the master machine config pool, even if the worker pools were not done updating.

[id="ocp-4-8-installation-fujitsu-irmc"]
==== Using Fujitsu iRMC for installation on bare metal nodes

In {product-title} 4.8, you can use Fujitsu hardware and the Fujitsu iRMC base board management controller protocol when deploying installer-provisioned clusters on bare metal. Currently Fujitsu supports iRMC S5 firmware version `3.05P` and above for installer-provisioned installation on bare metal. Enhancements and bug fixes for {product-title} 4.8 include:

* Supporting soft power-off on iRMC hardware.

* Stopping the provisioning services once the installer deploys the control plane on the bare metal nodes. See link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1949859[BZ#1949859] for more information.

* Adding an Ironic health check to the bootstrap `keepalived` checks. See link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1949859[BZ#1949859] for more information.

* Verifying that the unicast peers list isn't empty on the control plane nodes. See link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1957708[BZ#1957708] for more information.

* Updating the Bare Metal Operator to align the iRMC PowerInterface. See link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1957869[BZ#1957869] for more information.

* Updating the `pyghmi` library version. See link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1920294[BZ#1920294] for more information.

* Updating the Bare Metal Operator to address missing IPMI credentials. See link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1965182[BZ#1965182] for more information.

* Removing iRMC from `enabled_bios_interfaces`. See link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1969212[BZ#1969212] for more information.

* Adding `ironicTlsMount` and `inspectorTlsMount` to the
the bare metal pod definition. See link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1968701[BZ#1968701] for more information.

* Disabling the RAID feature for iRMC server. See link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1969487[BZ#1969487] for more information.

* Disabling RAID for all drivers. See link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1969487[BZ#1969487] for more information.

[id="ocp-4-8-web-console"]
=== Web console
[id="ocp-4-8-custom-console-routes-use-custom-domains-cluster-api"]
==== Custom console routes now use the new CustomDomains cluster API

For `console` and `downloads` routes, custom routes functionality is now implemented to use the new `ingress` config route configuration API `spec.componentRoutes`. The Console Operator config already contained custom route customization, but for the `console` route only. The route configuration via `console-operator` config is being deprecated. Therefore, if the `console` custom route is set up in both the `ingress` config and `console-operator` config, then the new `ingress` config custom route configuration takes precedent.

For more information, see xref:../web_console/customizing-the-web-console.adoc#customizing-the-web-console-url_customizing-web-console[Customizing console routes].

[id="ocp-4-8-ibm-z"]
==== IBM Z and LinuxONE

With this release, IBM Z and LinuxONE are now compatible with {product-title} {product-version}. The installation can be performed with z/VM or {op-system-base} KVM. For installation instructions, see the following documentation:

[id="ocp-4-8-access-code-snippet-from-quick-start"]
==== Access a code snippet from a Quick Start

You can now execute a CLI snippet when it is included in a Quick Start from the web console. To use this feature, you must first install the Web Terminal Operator. The web terminal and code snippet actions that execute in the web terminal are not present if you do not install the Web Terminal Operator. Alternatively, you can copy a code snippet to the clipboard regardless of whether you have the Web Terminal Operator installed or not.

[id="ocp-4-8-improved-presentation-quick-start-prereqs"]
==== Improved presentation of Quick Start prerequisites

Previously, Quick Start prerequisites were displayed as combined text instead of a list on the Quick Start card. With scalability in mind, the prerequisites are now presented in a popover rather than on the card.

image::quick-start-prerequisites.png[Quick Start prerequisites displayed as popover,338,336]

[id="ocp-4-8-security"]
=== Security and compliance

[id="ocp-4-8-security-log-oauth-tokens"]
==== Audit logging for OAuth access token logout requests

The `Default` audit log policy now logs request bodies for OAuth access token creation (login) and deletion (logout) requests. Previously, deletion request bodies were not logged.

For more information about audit log policies, see xref:../security/audit-log-policy-config.adoc#audit-log-policy-config[Configuring the node audit log policy].

[id="ocp-4-8-security-wildcard-subjects-headless-services"]
==== Wildcard subject for service serving certificates for headless services

Generating a service serving certificate for headless services now includes a wildcard subject in the format of `*.<service.name>.<service.namespace>.svc`. This allows for TLS-protected connections to individual stateful set pods without having to manually generate certificates for these pods.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the generated certificates contain wildcard subjects for headless services, do not use the service CA if your client must differentiate between individual pods. In this case:

* Generate individual TLS certificates by using a different CA.
* Do not accept the service CA as a trusted CA for connections that are directed to individual pods and must not be impersonated by other pods. These connections must be configured to trust the CA that was used to generate the individual TLS certificates.
====

For more information, see xref:../security/certificates/service-serving-certificate.adoc#add-service-certificate_service-serving-certificate[Add a service certificate].

[id="ocp-4-8-security-oc-compliance-plug-in"]
==== The oc-compliance plug-in is now available

The xref:../security/compliance_operator/compliance-operator-understanding.adoc#understanding-compliance-operator[Compliance Operator] automates many of the checks and remediations for an {product-title} cluster. However, the full process of bringing a cluster into compliance often requires administrator interaction with the Compliance Operator API and other components. The `oc-compliance` plug-in is now available and makes the process easier.

For more information, see xref:../security/oc_compliance_plug_in/oc-compliance-plug-in-using.adoc#using-oc-compliance-plug-in[Using the `oc-compliance` plug-in]

[id="ocp-4-8-security-tls-security-profile-control-plane"]
==== TLS security profile for the Kubernetes control plane

The Kubernetes API server TLS security profile setting is now also honored by the Kubernetes scheduler and Kubernetes controller manager.

For more information, see xref:../security/tls-security-profiles.adoc#tls-security-profiles[Configuring TLS security profiles].

[id="ocp-4-8-security-tls-security-profile-kubelet"]
==== TLS security profile for the kubelet as a server

You can now set a TLS security profile for kubelet when it acts as an HTTP server for the Kubernetes API server.

For more information, see xref:../security/tls-security-profiles.adoc#tls-security-profiles[Configuring TLS security profiles].

[id="ocp-4-8-networking"]
=== Networking

[id="ocp-4-8-dual-stack-support-bare-metal-ovn-kubernetes-network-provider"]
==== Dual-stack support on bare metal infrastructure with the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network provider

For clusters installed on bare metal infrastructure, the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network provider supports both IPv4 and IPv6 address families.

For clusters upgrading from previous versions of {product-title}, you must convert your cluster to support dual-stack networking. For more information, see xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/converting-to-dual-stack.adoc#converting-to-dual-stack[Converting to IPv4/IPv6 dual stack networking].

[id="ocp-4-8-migrate-openshift-sdn-ovn-kubernetes-user-provisioned"]
==== Migrate from OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes on user-provisioned infrastructure

An OpenShift SDN cluster network provider migration to the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network provider is supported for user-provisioned clusters. For more information, see xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/migrate-from-openshift-sdn.adoc#nw-ovn-kubernetes-migration-about_migrate-from-openshift-sdn[Migrate from the OpenShift SDN cluster network provider].

[id="ocp-4-8-openshift-sdn-egress-ips-balance"]
==== OpenShift SDN cluster network provider egress IP feature balances across nodes

The egress IP feature of OpenShift SDN now balances network traffic roughly equally across nodes for a given namespace, if that namespace is assigned multiple egress IP addresses. Each IP address must reside on a different node.
For more information, refer to xref:../networking/openshift_sdn/assigning-egress-ips.adoc#assigning-egress-ips[Configuring egress IPs for a project] for OpenShift SDN.

[id="ocp-4-8-network-policy-host-network-ingress-controllers"]
==== Network policy supports selecting host network Ingress Controllers

When using the OpenShift SDN or OVN-Kubernetes cluster network providers, you can select traffic from Ingress Controllers in a network policy rule regardless of whether an Ingress Controller runs on the cluster network or the host network.
In a network policy rule, the `network.openshift.io/policy-group: ingress` namespace selector matches traffic from an Ingress Controller.

In earlier releases of {product-title} the following limitations existed:

- A cluster using the OpenShift SDN cluster network provider could select traffic from an Ingress Controller on the host network only by applying the `network.openshift.io/policy-group: ingress` label to the `default` namespace.
- A cluster using the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network provider could not select traffic from an Ingress Controller on the host network.

For more information, refer to xref:../networking/network_policy/about-network-policy.adoc#about-network-policy[About network policy].

[id="ocp-4-8-network-policy-host-network-policy-group"]
==== Network policy supports selecting host network traffic

When using either the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network provider or the OpenShift SDN cluster network provider, you can use the `policy-group.network.openshift.io/host-network: ""` namespace selector to select host network traffic in a network policy rule.

[id="ocp-4-8-network-policy-audit-logs"]
==== Network policy audit logs

If you use the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network provider, you can enable audit logging for network policies in a namespace. The logs are in a syslog compatible format and can be saved locally, sent over a UDP connection, or directed to a UNIX domain socket. You can specify whether to log allowed, dropped, or both allowed and dropped connections.
For more information, see xref:../networking/network_policy/logging-network-policy.adoc#logging-network-policy[Logging network policy events].

[id="ocp-4-8-macvlan-multi-network-policy"]
==== Network policy support for macvlan additional networks

You can create network policies that apply to macvlan additional networks by using the `MultiNetworkPolicy` API, which implements the `NetworkPolicy` API.
For more information, see xref:../networking/multiple_networks/configuring-multi-network-policy.adoc#configuring-multi-network-policy[Configuring multi-network policy].

[id="ocp-4-8-supported-hardware-sriov"]
==== Supported hardware for SR-IOV

{product-title} {product-version} adds support for additional Intel and Mellanox hardware.

* Intel X710 and XL710 controllers
* Four Intel E810 family controllers: E810-CQDA2, E810-2CQDA2, E810-XXVDA2, E810-XXVDA4
* Mellanox ConnectX-5 Ex

For more information, see the xref:../networking/hardware_networks/about-sriov.adoc#supported-devices_about-sriov[supported devices].

[id="ocp-4-8-enhancements-sriov-network-operator"]
==== Enhancements to the SR-IOV Network Operator

The Network Resources Injector that is deployed with the Operator is enhanced to expose information about huge pages requests and limits with the Downward API. When a pod specification includes a huge pages request or limit, the information is exposed in the `/etc/podnetinfo` path.

For more information, see xref:../networking/hardware_networks/about-sriov.adoc#nw-sriov-hugepages_about-sriov[Huge pages resource injection for Downward API].

[id="ocp-4-8-tracking-network-flows"]
==== Tracking network flows

{product-title} {product-version} adds support for sending the metadata about network flows on the pod network to a network flows collector. The following protocols are supported:

* NetFlow

* sFlow

* IPFIX

Packet data is not sent to the network flows collector. Packet-level metadata such as the protocol, source address, destination address, port numbers, number of bytes, and other packet-level information is sent to the network flows collector.

For more information, see xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/tracking-network-flows.adoc#tracking-network-flows[Tracking network flows].

[id="ocp-4-8-coredns-mdns"]
==== CoreDNS-mDNS no longer used to resolve node names to IP addresses

{product-title} 4.8 and later releases include functionality that uses cluster membership information to generate A/AAAA records. This resolves the node names to their IP addresses. Once the nodes are registered with the API, the cluster can disperse node information without using CoreDNS-mDNS. This eliminates the network traffic associated with multicast DNS.

[id="ocp-4-8-preparation-haproxy-2.2"]
==== Converting HTTP header names to support upgrading to {product-title} 4.8

{product-title} updated to HAProxy 2.2, which changes HTTP header names to lowercase by default, for example, changing `Host: xyz.com` to `host: xyz.com`. For legacy applications that are sensitive to the capitalization of HTTP header names, use the Ingress Controller `spec.httpHeaders.headerNameCaseAdjustments` API field to accommodate legacy applications until they can be fixed. Make sure to add the necessary configuration by using `spec.httpHeaders.headerNameCaseAdjustments` before upgrading {product-title} now that HAProxy 2.2 is available.

For more information, see xref:../networking/ingress-operator.adoc#nw-ingress-converting-http-header-case_configuring-ingress[Converting HTTP header case].


[id="ocp-4-8-ingress-configuring-global-access-gcp"]
==== Configuring global access for an Ingress Controller on GCP

{product-title} {product-version} adds support for the global access option for Ingress Controllers created on GCP with an internal load balancer. When the global access option is enabled, clients in any region within the same VPC network and compute region as the load balancer can reach the workloads running on your cluster.

For more information, see xref:../networking/ingress-operator.adoc#nw-ingress-controller-configuration-gcp-global-access_configuring-ingress[Configuring global access for an Ingress Controller on GCP].

[id="ocp-4-8-setting-ingress-configuring-thread-count"]
==== Setting Ingress Controller thread count

{product-title} 4.8 adds support for setting the thread count to increase the amount of incoming connections a cluster can handle.

For more information, see xref:../networking/ingress-operator.adoc#nw-ingress-setting-thread-count_configuring-ingress[Setting Ingress Controller thread count].

[id="ocp-4-8-ingress-configuring-proxy-protocol"]
==== Configuring the PROXY protocol for an Ingress Controller

{product-title} 4.8 adds support for configuring the PROXY protocol for the Ingress Controller on non-cloud platforms, specifically for `HostNetwork` or `NodePortService` endpoint publishing strategy types.

For more information, see xref:../networking/ingress-operator.adoc#nw-ingress-controller-configuration-proxy-protocol_configuring-ingress[Configuring PROXY protocol for an Ingress Controller].

[id="ocp-4-8-networking-ntp-on-control-plane"]
==== NTP servers on control plane nodes

In {product-title} {product-version}, installer-provisioned clusters can configure and deploy Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers on the control plane nodes and NTP clients on worker nodes. This enables workers to retrieve the date and time from the NTP servers on the control plane nodes, even when disconnected from a routable network. You can also configure and deploy NTP servers and NTP clients after deployment.

[id="ocp-4-8-enhancements-kuryr-kubernetes"]
==== Changes to default API load balancer management for Kuryr

In {product-title} 4.8 deployments on {rh-openstack-first} with Kuryr-Kubernetes, the API load balancer for the `default/kubernetes` service is no longer managed by the Cluster Network Operator (CNO), but instead by the kuryr-controller itself. This means that:

* When upgrading to {product-title} 4.8, the `default/kubernetes` service will have downtime.

==== Enabling a provisioning network after installation

The assisted installer and installer-provisioned installation for bare metal clusters provide the ability to deploy a cluster without a `provisioning` network. In {product-title} 4.8 and later, you can enable a `provisioning` network after installation by using the Cluster Baremetal Operator (CBO).

[id="ocp-4-8-configure-vips-to-run-on-control-plane"]
==== Configure network components to run on the control plane

In {product-title} 4.8, for installer-provisioned installations, you must configure the `apiVIP` and `ingressVIP` virtual IP addresses to run exclusively on the control plane nodes. By default, {product-title} allows any node in the machine configuration pool to host the `apiVIP` and `ingressVIP` virtual IP addresses. Since many environments deploy worker nodes in separate subnets from the control plane nodes, configuring the `apiVIP` and `ingressVIP` virtual IP addresses to run exclusively on the control plane nodes prevents issues from arising due to deploying worker nodes in separate subnets.

[id="ocp-4-8-networking-external-load-balancer"]
==== Configuring an external load balancer for apiVIP and ingressVIP traffic

In {product-title} 4.8, you can configure an external load balancer to handle `apiVIP` and `ingressVIP` traffic to the control plane of installer-provisioned clusters. External load balancing services and the control plane nodes must run on the same L2 network, and on the same VLAN when using VLANs to route traffic between the load balancing services and the control plane nodes.

[id="ocp-4-8-IPsec-support-dual-stack"]
==== OVN-Kubernetes IPsec support for dual-stack networking

{product-title} 4.8 adds OVN-Kubernetes IPsec support for clusters that are configured to use dual-stack networking.

[id="ocp-4-8-egress-router-ovn-kubernetes"]
==== Egress router CNI for OVN-Kubernetes

The egress router CNI plug-in is generally available. The Cluster Network Operator is enhanced to support an `EgressRouter` API object. The process for adding an egress router on a cluster that uses OVN-Kubernetes is simplified. When you create an egress router object, the Operator automatically adds a network attachment definition and a deployment. The pod for the deployment acts as the egress router.

[id="ocp-4-8-olm"]
=== Operator lifecycle

[id="ocp-4-8-admin-error-reporting"]
==== Enhanced error reporting for administrators

A cluster administrator using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to install an Operator can encounter error conditions that are related either to the current API or low-level APIs. Previously, there was little insight into why OLM could not fulfill a request to install or update an Operator. These errors could range from trivial issues like typos in object properties or missing RBAC, to more complex issues where items could not be loaded from the catalog due to metadata parsing.

Because administrators should not require understanding of the interaction process between the various low-level APIs or access to the OLM pod logs to successfully debug such issues, {product-title} 4.8 introduces the following enhancements in OLM to provide administrators with more comprehensible error reporting and messages:

[id="ocp-4-8-installplan-errors"]
Retrying install plans::
Install plans, defined by an `InstallPlan` object, can encounter transient errors, for example, due to API server availability or conflicts with other writers. Previously, these errors would result in the termination of partially-applied install plans that required manual cleanup. With this enhancement, the Catalog Operator now retries errors during install plan execution for up to one minute. The new `.status.message` field provides a human-readable indication when retries are occurring.

[id="ocp-4-8-operatorgroup-errors"]
Indicating invalid Operator groups::
Creating a subscription in a namespace with no Operator groups or multiple Operator groups would previously result in a stalled Operator installation with an install plan that stays in `phase=Installing` forever. With this enhancement, the install plan immediately transitions to `phase=Failed` so that the administrator can correct the invalid Operator group, and then delete and re-create the subscription again.

[id="ocp-4-8-candidate-operator-errors"]
Specific reporting when no candidate Operators found::
`ResolutionFailed` events, which are created when dependency resolution in a namespace fails, now provide more specific text when the namespace contains a subscription that references a package or channel that does not exist in the referenced catalog source. Previously, this message was generic:
+
[source,terminal]
----
no candidate operators found matching the spec of subscription '<name>'
----
+
With this enhancement, the messages are more specific:
+
.Operator does not exist
[source,terminal]
----
no operators found in package <name> in the catalog referenced by subscription <name>
----
+
.Catalog does not exist
[source,terminal]
----
no operators found from catalog <name> in namespace openshift-marketplace referenced by subscription <name>

[id="ocp-4-8-pkgman-to-bundle"]
==== Migration of Operator projects from package manifest format to bundle format

The bundle format is the preferred Operator packaging format for Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) starting in {product-title} 4.6. If you have an Operator project that was initially created in the package manifest format, which has been deprecated, you can now use the Operator SDK `pkgman-to-bundle` command to migrate the project to the bundle format.

==== Scaling machines running in vSphere to and from zero with the cluster autoscaler

When running machines in vSphere, you can now set the `minReplicas` value to `0` in the `MachineAutoscaler` resource definition. When this value is set to `0`, the cluster autoscaler scales the machine set to and from zero depending on if the machines are in use. For more information, see the xref:../machine_management/applying-autoscaling.html#machine-autoscaler-cr_applying-autoscaling[MachineAutoscaler resource definition].

[id="ocp-4-8-mco-no-reboot-cert"]
==== Automatic rotation of kubelet-ca.crt does not require node draining or reboot

The automatic rotation of the `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet-ca.crt` certificate authority (CA) no longer requires the Machine Config Operator (MCO) to drain nodes or reboot the cluster.

As part of this change, the following modifications do not require the MCO to drain nodes:

** changes to the SSH key in the `spec.config.ignition.passwd.users.sshAuthorizedKeys` parameter of a machine config
** changes to the global pull secret or pull secret in the `openshift-config` namespace

When the MCO detects any of these changes, it applies the changes and uncordons the node.

[id="ocp-4-8-nodes-descheduler-metrics"]
==== Prometheus metrics for the descheduler

You can now enable Prometheus metrics for the descheduler by adding the `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true` label to the `openshift-kube-descheduler-operator` namespace where you installed the descheduler.

The following descheduler metrics are available:

* `descheduler_build_info` - Provides build information about the descheduler.
* `descheduler_pods_evicted` - Provides the number of pods that have been evicted for each combination of strategy, namespace, and result. There must be at least one evicted pod for this metric to appear.

[id="ocp-4-8-nodes-huge-pages-downward-api"]
==== Support for huge pages with the Downward API

With this release, when you set requests and limits for huge pages in a pod specification, you can use the Downward API to view the allocation for the pod from within a container. This enhancements relies on the `DownwardAPIHugePages` feature gate. {product-title} {product-version} enables the feature gate.

For more information, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/what-huge-pages-do-and-how-they-are-consumed-by-apps.adoc#consuming-huge-pages-resource-using-the-downward-api_huge-pages[Consuming huge pages resources using the Downward API].

[id='ocp-4-8-nodes-nfd-operator-new-labels_{context}']
==== New labels for the Node Feature Discovery Operator

The Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Operator detects hardware features available on each node in an {product-title} cluster. Then, it modifies node objects with node labels. This enables the NFD Operator to advertise the features of specific nodes. {product-title} {product-version} supports three additional labels for the NFD Operator.

- `pstate intel-pstate`: When the Intel `pstate` driver is enabled and in use, the `pstate intel-pstate` label reflects the status of the Intel `pstate` driver. The status is either `active` or `passive`.

- `pstate scaling_governor`: When the Intel `pstate` driver status is `active`, the `pstate scaling_governor` label reflects the scaling governor algorithm. The algorithm is either `powersave` or `performance`.

- `cstate status`: If the `intel_idle` driver has C-states or idle states, the `cstate status` label is `true`. Otherwise, it is `false`.

[id="ocp-4-8-nodes-no-reboot-cert"]
==== Automatic rotation of kubelet-ca.crt does not require reboot

The automatic rotation of the `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet-ca.crt` certificate authority (CA) no longer requires the Machine Config Operator (MCO) to drain nodes or reboot the cluster.

[id="ocp-4-8-nodes-vpa-ga"]
==== Vertical pod autoscaling is generally available

The {product-title} vertical pod autoscaler (VPA) is now generally available. The VPA automatically reviews the historic and current CPU and memory resources for containers in pods and can update the resource limits and requests based on the usage values it learns.

You can also use the VPA with pods that require only one replica by modifying the `VerticalPodAutoscalerController` object as described below. Previously, the VPA worked only with pods that required two or more replicas.

For more information, see xref:../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-vertical-autoscaler.adoc#nodes-pods-vertical-autoscaler[Automatically adjust pod resource levels with the vertical pod autoscaler].

[id="ocp-4-8-nodes-vpa-replicas"]
==== Vertical pod autoscaling minimum can be configured

By default, workload objects must specify a minimum of two replicas in order for the VPA to automatically update pods. As a result, workload objects that specify fewer than two replicas are not acted upon by the VPA. You can change this cluster-wide minimum value by modifying the `VerticalPodAutoscalerController` object to add the `minReplicas` parameter.

For more information, see xref:../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-vertical-autoscaler.adoc#nodes-pods-vertical-autoscaler[Automatically adjust pod resource levels with the vertical pod autoscaler].

[id="ocp-4-8-nodes-resources-configuring-auto_{context}"]
==== Automatically allocate CPU and memory resources for nodes

{product-title} can automatically determine the optimal sizing value of the `system-reserved` setting when a node starts. Previously, the CPU and memory allocations in the `system-reserved` setting were fixed limits that you needed to manually determine and set.

When automatic resource allocation is enabled, a script on each node calculates the optimal values for the respective reserved resources based on the installed CPU and memory capacity on the node.

For more information, see xref:../nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-resources-configuring.adoc#nodes-nodes-resources-configuring-auto_nodes-nodes-resources-configuring[Automatically allocating resources for nodes].

Device network queues allow packets to be distributed among different physical queues, and each queue gets a separate thread for packet processing.

For Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) based workloads, it is important to reduce the NIC queues to only the number of reserved or housekeeping CPUs to ensure the desired low latency is achieved.

=== Deprecated features

[id="ocp-4-8-descheduler-apigroup-deprecated"]
==== Descheduler operator.openshift.io/v1beta1 API group is deprecated

The `operator.openshift.io/v1beta1` API group for the descheduler is deprecated and might be removed in a future release. Use the `operator.openshift.io/v1` API group instead.

[id="ocp-4-8-dhclient-deprecated"]
==== Use of dhclient in {op-system-first} is deprecated

Starting with {product-title} 4.6, {op-system-first} switched to using `NetworkManager` in the `initramfs` to configure networking during early boot. As part of this change, the use of the `dhclient` binary for DHCP was deprecated. Use the `NetworkManager` internal DHCP client for networking configuration instead. The `dhclient` binary will be removed from {op-system-first} in a future release. See link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1908462[BZ#1908462] for more information.

== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.8 and beyond!
* In {product-title} 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.
+
If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.1 to 4.8, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. It is recommended to revoke unauthenticated access unless there is a specific need for it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP `403` errors if you revoke unauthenticated access.
====
+
Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:
+
[source,bash]
----
## Snippet to remove unauthenticated group from all the cluster role bindings
$ for clusterrolebinding in cluster-status-binding discovery system:basic-user system:discovery system:openshift:discovery ;
do
### Find the index of unauthenticated group in list of subjects
index=$(oc get clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} -o json | jq 'select(.subjects!=null) | .subjects | map(.name=="system:unauthenticated") | index(true)');
### Remove the element at index from subjects array
oc patch clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} --type=json --patch "[{'op': 'remove','path': '/subjects/$index'}]";
done
----
+
This script removes unauthenticated subjects from the following cluster role bindings:
+
--
** `cluster-status-binding`
** `discovery`
** `system:basic-user`
** `system:discovery`
** `system:openshift:discovery`
--
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821771[*BZ#1821771*])

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.9 and beyond!
* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])

* When powering on a virtual machine on vSphere with user-provisioned infrastructure, the process of scaling up a node might not work as expected. A known issue in the hypervisor configuration causes machines to be created within the hypervisor but not powered on. If a node appears to be stuck in the `Provisioning` state after scaling up a machine set, you can investigate the status of the virtual machine in the vSphere instance itself. Use the VMware commands `govc tasks` and `govc events` to determine the status of the virtual machine. Check for a similar error message to the following:
+
[source,terminal]
----
[Invalid memory setting: memory reservation (sched.mem.min) should be equal to memsize(8192). ]
----
+
You can attempt to resolve the issue with the steps in this link:https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2002779[VMware KBase article]. For more information, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase solution link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5785341[[UPI vSphere\] Node scale-up doesn't work as expected]. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1918383[*BZ#1918383*])
* The installation of {op-system} on a {op-system-base} KVM installation on IBM Z fails when using an ECKD type DASD as a VirtIO block device. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1960485[*BZ#1960485*])

* An Open Virtual Network (OVN) bug causes persistent connectivity issues with Octavia load balancers. When Octavia load balancers are created, OVN might not plug them into some Neutron subnets. These load balancers might be unreachable for some of the Neutron subnets. This problem affects Neutron subnets, which are created for each OpenShift namespace, at random when Kuryr is configured. As a result, when this problem occurs the load balancer that implements OpenShift `Service` objects will be unreachable from OpenShift namespaces affected by the issue. Because of this bug, {product-title} 4.8 deployments that use Kuryr SDN are not recommended on {rh-openstack-first} 16.1 with OVN and OVN Octavia configured until the bug is fixed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1937392[*BZ#1937392*])

* The Console Operator does not properly update the `Ingress` resource with the `componentRoutes` conditions for either of the console's routes (`console` or `downloads`). (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1954148[*BZ#1954148*])

* If you are using {sandboxed-containers-first}, you cannot use the `hostPath` volume in a {product-title} cluster to mount a file or directory from the host nodeâ€™s file system into your pod.
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1904609[*BZ#1904609*])

* If you are running Fedora on {sandboxed-containers-first}, you need a workaround to install some packages. Some packages, like `iputils`, require file access permission changes that {product-title} does not grant to containers by default. To run containers that require such special permissions, it is necessary to add an annotation to the YAML file describing the workload, which tells `virtiofsd` to accept such file permissions for that workload. The required annotations are:
+
[source,yaml]
----
io.katacontainers.config.hypervisor.virtio_fs_extra_args: [ "-o", "modcaps=+sys_admin", "-o", "xattr" ]
----
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1915377[*BZ#1915377*])

* In the 4.8 release, adding a value to `kataConfgPoolSelector` by using the {product-title} web console causes `scheduling.nodeSelector` to be populated with an empty value. Pods that use `RuntimeClass` with the value of `kata` might be scheduled to nodes that do not have the Kata Containers runtime installed.
+
To work around this issue, specify theÂ `nodeSelector`Â value manually in theÂ `RuntimeClass` `kata` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit runtimeclass kata
----
+
The following is an example of a `RuntimeClass` with the correct `nodeSelector` statement.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
handler: kata
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2021-06-14T12:54:19Z"

    custom-kata-pool: "true"
----
+
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KATA-764[*KATA-764*])

* The {sandboxed-containers-operator} details page on Operator Hub contains a few missing fields. The missing fields do not prevent you from installing the {sandboxed-containers-operator} in 4.8.
+
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KATA-826[*KATA-826*])

* Creating multiple `KataConfig` custom resources results in a silent failure. The {product-title} web console does not provide a prompt to notify the user that creating more than one custom resource has failed.
+
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KATA-725[*KATA-725*])

* Sometimes the Operator Hub in the {product-title} web console does not display icons for an Operator.
+
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KATA-804[*KATA-804*])

* The OVN-Kubernetes network provider does not support the `externalTrafficPolicy` feature for `NodePort`- and `LoadBalancer`-type services.  The `service.spec.externalTrafficPolicy` field determines whether traffic for a service is routed to node-local or cluster-wide endpoints. Currently, such traffic is routed by default to cluster-wide endpoints, and there is no way to limit traffic to node-local endpoints. This will be resolved in a future release. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1903408[*BZ#1903408*])

* Currently, a Kubernetes port collision issue can cause a breakdown in pod-to-pod communication, even after pods are redeployed. For detailed information and a workaround, see the Red Hat Knowledge Base solution link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5940711[Port collisions between pod and cluster IPs on OpenShift 4 with OVN-Kubernetes]. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1939676[*BZ#1939676*], link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1939045[*BZ#1939045*])
