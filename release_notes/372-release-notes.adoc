[id="new-features-372"]
== New features

[id="removal-inactive-clusters"]
=== Automatic removal of nonactive clusters from RHACS

{product-title-short} provides the ability to configure your system to automatically remove nonactive clusters from {product-title-short} so that you can monitor active clusters only. Note that only clusters that were installed and performed a handshake with Central at least one time are monitored initially. If this feature is enabled, when Central has been unable to reach Sensor in a cluster for the period of time configured in the *Decommissioned cluster age* field, the cluster is considered nonactive in {product-title-short}. Central will then no longer monitor nonactive clusters. You can configure the *Decommissioned cluster age* field in the *Platform Configuration* -> *System Configuration* page. When configuring this feature, you can add a label for the cluster so that {product-title-short} continues to monitor the cluster even if it becomes nonactive. For more information, see xref:../configuration/configure-inactive-cluster-deletion.adoc#configure-active-cluster-deletion[Configuring automatic removal of nonactive clusters from {product-title-short}].

[id="unauthenticated-email-integration"]
=== Support for unauthenticated email integration

{product-title-short} now supports unauthenticated SMTP for email integrations. This is insecure and not recommended. However, you might need to use unauthenticated SMTP for some integrations; for example, if you use an internal server for notifications that does not require authentication. For more information, see xref:../integration/integrate-with-email.adoc#configure-acs-kube-security-platform[Configuring the email plug-in].

[id="quay-robot-accounts"]
=== Support for Quay robot accounts

{product-title-short} now supports use of robot accounts in quay.io integrations. You can create robot accounts in Quay that allow you to share credentials for use in multiple repositories. Robot accounts authenticate with the Quay Container Registry and replace OAuth tokens, which are deprecated by Quay. For more information, see xref:../integration/integrate-with-image-registries.adoc#manual-configuration-image-registry-qcr_integrate-with-image-registries[Manually configuring Quay Container Registry].

[id="view-dockerfile-line-cve"]
=== Ability to view Dockerfile lines in images that introduced components with Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)

In the *Images* view, under *Image Findings*, you can view individual lines in the Dockerfile that introduced the components that have been identified as containing CVEs. To view this information, locate the CVE from the list of CVEs provided in the *Image Findings* page. In the *Affected Components* column, click on the *<number> components* link. You can expand the display to show the line where the component was introduced that contains the CVE. For more information, see xref:../operating/examine-images-for-vulnerabilities.adoc#identify-dockerfile-line-component-cve_examine-images-for-vulnerabilities[Identifying Dockerfile lines in images that introduced components with CVEs].

[id="network-graph-improvements"]
=== Network graph improvements

{product-title-short} 3.72 includes the following improvements to the Network Graph:

* The updated legend in the Network Graph shows the symbols and explanatory text together. Before this improvement, the legend required hovering over the symbols representing namespaces, deployments, and connections.
* Sometimes, the graph view edges did not connect the edges of nodes and overlapped on namespaces. This issue is fixed.
* With this update, {product-title-short} shows the same formatting and interface when you view YAML files. Before this improvement, there were differences in the YAML file viewer instances.

[id="doc-updates-372"]
=== Documentation updates

The {product-title-short} documentation has been updated to include a xref:../operating/default-security-policies.adoc#default-security-policies[list of default security policies].

[id="notable-tech-changes-372"]
== Notable technical changes

[id="rhel9-scan"]
=== Scanning support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9

RHEL 9 is now generally available (GA). {product-title-short} 3.72 introduces support for analyzing images built with Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI) 9 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9 RPMs for vulnerabilities.

[id="fixable-cvss6-disabled"]
=== Policy for CVEs with fixable CVSS of 6 or greater disabled by default

Beginning with this release, the `Fixable CVSS >= 6 and Privileged` policy is no longer enabled by default for new {product-title-short} installations. The configuration of this policy is not changed when upgrading an existing system. A new policy `Privileged Containers with Important and Critical Fixable CVEs`, which gives an alert for containers running in privileged mode that have important or critical fixable vulnerabilities, has been added. The new policy is also in the `Deploy` lifecycle. Known vulnerabilities make it easier for adversaries to exploit your application, and highly-privileged containers pose greater risk. You can fix these high-severity vulnerabilities by updating to a newer version of the affected components or running your container with lower privileges.

[id="deprecation-notices-372"]

[id="deprecated-features-372"]
=== Deprecated features

This section provides additional information about some of the deprecated features listed in the previous table.

. `/v1/cves/suppress` and `/v1/cves/unsuppress` have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. After these are removed:
** Use `/v1/imagecves/suppress` and `/v1/imagecves/unsuppress` to snooze and unsnooze image vulnerabilities.
** Use `/v1/nodecves/suppress` and `/v1/nodecves/unsuppress` to snooze and unsnooze node and host vulnerabilities.
** Use `/v1/clustercves/suppress` and `/v1/clustercves/unsuppress` to snooze and unsnooze platform (Kubernetes, Istio, and {ocp}) vulnerabilities.
. Previously, groups were retrieved by using the field `props`: `props.authProviderId`, `props.key`, and `props.value`. This field will be replaced by the new `props.id` field. Use the `props.id` field to retrieve groups in the {product-title-short} API. Note the following:
** Retrieval by using the `props` fields will be removed in a future release.
** Until removal, retrieval by using the `props` field will work if the result is unambiguous (no more than one group is found with the `props` field).
. Permission `ClusterCVE` is deprecated and will be superseded by the existing permission `Cluster`.
. Permissions for permission sets will be grouped for simplification. The following list describes the new permissions and indicates the deprecated permissions that will be removed in a future release:
** The `Access` permission will replace the following permissions: `AuthProvider`, `Group`, `Licenses`, `Role`, and `User`.
** The `DeploymentExtension` permission will replace the following permissions: `Indicator`, `NetworkBaseline`, `ProcessWhitelist`, and `Risk`.
** The `Integration` permission will deprecate the following permissions: `APIToken`, `BackupPlugins`, `ImageIntegration`, `Notifier`, and `SignatureIntegration`.
** The `Image` permission will replace the permission `ImageComponent`.
. `Label` and `Annotation` search options in {product-title-short} are deprecated and will be removed in the {product-title-short} 3.73 release. They will be replaced by the search options listed in the following table.

[id="psp-changes"]
=== PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) objects and Kubernetes 1.25

The following changes were made in {product-title-short} to support the removal of PSP objects in Kubernetes 1.25:

* PSP objects are created by default in installations for backward compatibility with Kubernetes versions prior to 1.25. However, you can manually disable PSP creation by setting `system.enablePodSecurityPolicies: false` in the Helm chart.
* Beginning with {product-title-short} version 3.71, auto-sensing has been added to {product-title-short} Helm charts. If you install {product-title-short} using the Operator or Helm charts, and {product-title-short} detects a Kubernetes version of 1.25 or later, it will not install PSPs. If you are using the `roxctl` CLI to install {product-title-short}, you need to disable PSP usage by setting the `--enable-pod-security-policies` flag to `false` for the `roxctl central generate` and `roxctl sensor generate` commands.

Kubernetes users must disable the admission controller plugin for PSPs before upgrading to Kubernetes version 1.25.


[id="upcoming-api-changes"]
=== Notice of upcoming RHACS API changes

* CSV export: Beginning in the {product-title-short} 3.73 release, the CSV export `API /api/vm/export/csv` will require the `CVE Type` filter as part of the input query parameter. Requests that do not have the filter will return an error. Supported values for `CVE Type` are `IMAGE_CVE`, `K8S_CVE`, `ISTIO_CVE`, `NODE_CVE`, and `OPENSHIFT_CVE`.

* Suppress and unsuppress payloads:
** The field `ids` in the `/v1/cves/suppress` and `/v1/cves/unsuppress` API payloads will be renamed to `cves` in the {product-title-short} 3.73 release.
** The `cves.ids` field of the `storage.VulnerabilityRequest` object in the response of `VulnerabilityRequestService` endpoints will be renamed to `cves.cves` in the {product-title-short} 3.73 release.

[id="known-issues-372"]
== Known issues

{product-title-short} shows the wrong severity when two severities exist for a single vulnerability in a single distribution. This issue occurs because {product-title-short} scopes severities by namespace rather than component. There is no workaround. It is anticipated that an upcoming release will include a fix for this issue. (ROX-12527)

[id="bug-fixes-372"]
== Bug fixes

[id="resolved-in-version-3720"]
=== Resolved in version 3.72.0

Release date: 26 September 2022

* Before this update, the steps to configure {ocp} OAuth for more than one URI were missing. The documentation has been revised to include instructions for configuring OAuth in {ocp} to use more than one URI. For more information, see xref:../operating/manage-user-access/configure-ocp-oauth.adoc#create-additional-routes-ocp-oauth_configure-ocp-oauth[Creating additional routes for the OpenShift Container Platform OAuth server]. (ROX-11296)
* Before this update, the autogenerated image integration, such as a Docker registry integration, for a cluster is not deleted when the cluster is removed from Central. This issue is fixed. (ROX-9398)
* Before this update, the `Image OS` policy criteria did not support regular expressions, or `regex`. However, the documentation indicated that regular expressions were supported. This issue is fixed by adding support for regular expressions for the `Image OS` policy criteria. (ROX-12301)
* Before this update, the syslog integration did not respect a configured TCP proxy. This is now fixed.
* Before this update, the `scanner-db` pod failed to start when a resource quota was set for the `stackrox` namespace, because the `init-db` container in the pod did not have any resources assigned to it. The `init-db` container for `ScannerDB` now specifies resource requests and limits that match the `db` container. (ROX-12291)

[id="resolved-in-version-3721"]
=== Resolved in version 3.72.1

Release date: 20 October 2022

* Because of a bug in {product-title-short} 3.72.0, the Collector pods previously stopped responding and reach a segmentation fault after allocating a memory block for the protocol buffer heap under certain load conditions.
The patch release 3.72.1 fixes this issue.
* In {product-title-short} 3.72.0, scheduled vulnerability reports consistently reported zero vulnerabilities, even if there were images with CVEs within the clusters.
The patch release 3.72.1 fixes this error and the reports show the correct CVEs.
* In {product-title-short} 3.72.0, when you created a deployment bundle by using the `roxctl` CLI that explicitly disabled Pod Security Policies (PSP), the generated bundle still created manifests for the PSP.
As a result, installing the deployment bundle failed when deploying on Kubernetes versions 1.25 or later.
The patch release 3.72.1 correctly disables PSP when you specify `--enable-pod-security-policies=false` with the `roxctl` CLI.

[id="resolved-in-version-3722"]
=== Resolved in version 3.72.2

Release date: 1 December 2022

* Before this update, if Central downloaded a corrupted CVE data file, it failed and entered a `CrashLoopBackOff` state. The patch release 3.72.2 fixes this issue.

[id="resolved-in-version-3723"]
=== Resolved in version 3.72.3

Release date: 12 January 2023

* The release of RHACS 3.72.3 addresses the following security
vulnerabilities identified in the previous release:

- link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:7089[RHSA-2022:7089]
