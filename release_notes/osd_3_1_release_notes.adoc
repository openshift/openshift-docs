== Overview

OpenShift Dedicated by Red Hat is a new product offering based on OpenShift Enterprise, which provides a hosted OpenShift 3 environment to run the containers powering customer applications.

This product isolates your instance from other customers, providing security and management by the OpenShift operations team.

== Key Features

OpenShift Dedicated offers a dedicated, customized, and managed application platform in the public cloud, which is powered by OpenShift 3 and backed by Red Hat Operations and support.

The main features of OpenShift Dedicated 3.1 are:

* Self Service: Quickly and easily create applications on demand.

* Container-based: Incorporating Docker and Kubernetes.

* Infrastructure Management: The OpenShift Operations Team will take care of infrastructure maintenance, including updates, configuration, and security.

* Hosting Regions: OpenShift Dedicated allows for hosting in any region supported by AWS EC2, including Asia Pacific, EU, South America, US East, and US West.

== How Is OpenShift Dedicated Different than OpenShift Enterprise?

OpenShift Dedicated uses the same code base as OpenShift Enterprise 3. OpenShift Dedicated is hosted on the public cloud and managed by Red Hat. An OpenShift Enterprise 3 subscription entitles you to host and manage the software on your infrastructure of choice.
