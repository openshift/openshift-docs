== Overview

https://www.openshift.com/dedicated/[OpenShift Dedicated] is a new offering
based on OpenShift Enterprise that provides a hosted OpenShift 3 environment to
run the containers powering your applications.

With OpenShift Dedicated, your cluster is isolated from other customers,
providing security and management by the OpenShift Operations Team.

== Key Features

OpenShift Dedicated offers a dedicated, customized, and managed application
platform in the public cloud, which is powered by OpenShift 3 and backed by Red
Hat Operations and Support. Key features include:

Established Enterprise Technology::
Leverage the latest in container technology based on open source standards. This
includes Docker container packaging, Kubernetes container orchestration,
application lifecycle management, and an extensive set of developer tools.

Isolated Public Platform::
Your high availability (HA) platform cluster and application servers will only
contain your users, applications, and services, offering increased security and
the ability to connect to local services.

Flexible Application Environment::
Rapidly deploy and scale applications using a wide variety of supported
languages and services, or provide your own.

Expanded Hosting Regions::
OpenShift Dedicated allows for hosting in most regions supported by AWS EC2,
including Asia Pacific (Tokyo, Singapore, and Sydney), EU (Frankfurt and
Ireland), South America (Sao Paulo), US East (N. Virginia), and US West (N.
California and Oregon).

See https://www.openshift.com/dedicated[openshift.com/dedicated] for more
information.

== How Is OpenShift Dedicated Different than OpenShift Enterprise?

OpenShift Dedicated uses the same code base as OpenShift Enterprise 3. OpenShift
Dedicated is hosted on the public cloud and managed by Red Hat. An OpenShift
Enterprise 3 subscription entitles you to host and manage the software on your
infrastructure of choice.

For more detailed technical notes on the underlying code base, see the
https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/release_notes/index.html[OpenShift
Enterprise 3.1 Release Notes].
