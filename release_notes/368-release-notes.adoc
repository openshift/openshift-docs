{product-title} ({product-title-short}) 3.68 includes feature enhancements, bug fixes, scale improvements, and other changes.

*Release date:* January 31, 2022

[id="new-features"]
== New features

[id="vulnerability-triage-workflows"]
=== Vulnerability triage workflows
{product-title} 3.68 includes the ability to triage vulnerabilities in a variety of ways to support your vulnerability management process.
See xref:../operating/manage-vulnerabilities.adoc#vulnerability-management-proccess_acs-operating-manage-vulnerabilities[Managing vulnerabilities] for more information.

[id="report-scheduling"]
=== Report scheduling for vulnerabilities
{product-title} 3.68 includes the ability to schedule reports for vulnerabilities helping you to send scheduled communications to key stakeholders to assist in the vulnerability management process. See xref:../operating/manage-vulnerabilities.adoc#vulnerability-management-reporting_acs-operating-manage-vulnerabilities[Reporting vulnerabilities to teams] for more information.

[id="use-aws-ecr-assumeroles"]
=== Use AWS ECR AssumeRoles
AWS AssumeRoles allows you to define roles with specific permissions and then granting users access to those roles. {product-title} 3.68 includes the ability to use AWS ECR AssumeRoles to configure roles and grant various levels of access to users.
For more details, see xref:../integration/integrate-with-image-registries.adoc#use-assumerole-with-ecr[Using assumerole with Amazon ECR].

[id="output-format-enhancements"]
=== Enhancements for CI outputs
Red Hat has improved the usability of {product-title} CI integrations. CI outputs now show additional detailed information about the vulnerabilities and the security policies responsible for broken builds.

[id="known-issue"]
== Known issue
When the same software package is installed in multiple layers in a docker image {product-title-short} may incorrectly identify the state of that package.

[id="important-bug-fixes"]
== Important bug fixes

* *ROX-8709*: Previously, searching for CVE's with a specific severity did not returned any results. This issue has been fixed.
* *ROX-8983*: Previously, when configuring the *Manage Watches* feature, if you added more than 12 images to the watch list, the image list would not display properly. This issue has been fixed.
* *ROX-8276*: Previously, when the {product-title-short} Operator accessed the `central-htpasswd` secret, it would create a false positive policy violation for the *OpenShift: Advanced Cluster Security Central Admin Secret Accessed* default policy. This issue has been fixed.

[id="security-update"]
== Security update
In earlier versions of {product-title}, the `write` permission for the `APIToken` resource allowed users to create API tokens for any role, including the `admin` role. This issue has been fixed.

[id="important-system-changes"]
== Important system changes

* {product-title-short} 3.68 includes updates for the `Log4Shell` vulnerability detection policy. With this update this policy also detects CVE-2021-45046 and it includes the updated remediation based on the latest guidance by the Apache Logging security team.
* Before this release, CVEs could be snoozed using global write access on the `Images` resource. Beginning with {product-title-short} 3.68:
** To snooze CVEs, you must have `write` permission for the `VulnerabilityManagementRequests` resource.
** To approve requests, you must have `write` permission for the `VulnerabilityManagementApprovals` resource.
* When you upgrade to {product-title-short} 3.68, roles that include `write` access on the `Images` resource will have `write` permissions for both  `VulnerabilityManagementRequests` and `VulnerabilityManagementApprovals` resource.
Red Hat recommends updating the roles to only include the least amount of resources required for each role.
* If you have installed {product-title} using Helm, this update disabled the cluster configuration options in the {product-title-short} portal. You can continue to use Helm configuration files.
* {product-title-short} 3.68 sends notifications for every runtime policy violation rather than sending notifications only the first encountered violation. This is the default behavior. To change it, you must set the `NOTIFY_EVERY_RUNTIME_EVENT` to `false`.

* Red Hat has moved the following images to new repositories:

[%header,cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Image
|Old repository
|New repository

|main
m|registry.redhat.io/rh-acs/main
m|registry.redhat.io/advanced-cluster-security/rhacs-main-rhel8

|collector
|`registry.redhat.io/rh-acs/collector`, with the `-latest` tag.
m|registry.redhat.io/advanced-cluster-security/rhacs-collector-rhel8

|collector-slim
|registry.redhat.io/rh-acs/collector-slim, with the `-slim` tag.

|===

* Tags of the `scanner`, `scanner-db`, and `collector` images, including the `collector-slim` variant, are now identical to the `main` image tag.
In addition, all these tags now match the version of {product-title}.
For example, a scanner image for {product-title-short} 3.68.0 is now identified as `registry.redhat.io/advanced-cluster-security/rhacs-scanner-rhel8:3.68.0` and `stackrox.io/scanner:3.68.0`. Make sure you follow the same versioning scheme when you upgrade manually.
* Red Has changed the image names for `collector-slim`. `-slim` is no longer part of the image tag. Collector Slim image for the release 3.68.0 is identified as `registry.redhat.io/advanced-cluster-security/rhacs-collector-slim-rhel8:3.68.0` and `collector.stackrox.io/collector-slim:3.68.0`.
* Scanner DB image at `registry.redhat.io/advanced-cluster-security/rhacs-scanner-db-rhel8` is now based on `rhel8/postgresql-12`.
* The `roxctl` CLI includes a new `--image-defaults` option for the `roxctl helm output` and `roxctl central generate` commands. It allows selecting the default registry from which container images are taken for deploying central and scanner.
* Red Hat has deprecated the `--rhacs` option for the `roxctl helm output` command. Use `--rhacs-image-defaults` option instead.
* By default, the `roxctl helm output` command now uses the images from `registry.redhat.io` rather than `stackrox.io`.

[id="image-versions"]
== Image versions

[IMPORTANT]
====
Beginning with {product-title-short} 3.68, Red Hat has updated the image versioning convention for the `Scanner`, `Scanner DB`, and `Collector` images.
As a result, the version numbers for these images now match the version numbers for the `Main` image.
In addition, due to the change in image repository names in `registry.redhat.io`, if you mirror {product-title-short} image repositories, you must verify your mirroring is set up to mirror images from the new locations.
