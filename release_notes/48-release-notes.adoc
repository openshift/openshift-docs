[id="new-features-rn-48_{context}"]
== New features

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts:

//ROX-20769
[id="central-db-postgresql_15_{context}"]
=== Central DB uses PostgreSQL 15

The Central DB component now uses PostgreSQL 15, and {product-title-short} 4.8
supports this version for external databases. A new installation with an
internal database now uses this version by default. When upgrading an existing
cluster to {product-title-short} 4.8, Central DB will perform an upgrade of the
data it has collected.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When preparing the upgrade to {product-title-short} 4.8, follow these
suggestions:

* Back up the database before upgrading to {product-title-short} 4.8

* If you are not upgrading by using the Operator, check the disk space
  available for the database by viewing the
  `rox_central_postgres_available_size_bytes` metric. For the purposes of the
  upgrade, the value should be double the amount of the already-consumed disk
  space, as shown in the `rox_central_postgres_total_size_bytes` metric. If the
  value is not correct, extend the database PVC.

* Do not interrupt the upgrade procedure. If the upgrade is interrupted, a
  manual intervention might be required to proceed.

Depending on the amount of data, the upgrade can take extra time to finish.

1. API token authentication is deprecated. The corresponding cloud source integration now uses service accounts for authentication.

2. The Google Container Registry integration is deprecated in response to the deprecation of Container Registry. You can use the Artifact Registry as a registry replacement and Scanner V4 as a scanner replacement.
+
For more information, see link:https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/transition/transition-from-gcr[Transition from Container Registry] (Google Cloud documentation).

3. Kernel support packages and driver download functionality are deprecated.

4. The `rhacs-collector-slim*` image is deprecated and has been removed in {product-title-short} 4.7.0. `rhacs-collector*` image used to contain kernel modules and eBPF probes, but {product-title-short} no longer needs those items.
The `rhacs-collector*` and the `rhacs-collector-slim*` images are now functionally the same.

5. A feature flag controls this API object, and you can enable or disable this API object by using the `ROX_VULN_MGMT_LEGACY_SNOOZE` environment variable.

6. The format for specifying duration in JSON requests to `v1/nodecves/suppress`, `v1/clustercves/suppress`, and `v1/imagecves/suppress` has been changed to the ProtoJSON format.
Only a numeric value representing seconds with optional fractional seconds for nanosecond precision and followed by the `s` suffix is supported.
+
For example, `0.300s`, `-5400s`, or `9900s`. The previously valid time units of `ns`, `us`, `Âµs`, `ms`, `m`, and `h` are no longer supported.

7. The *Vulnerability Management* -> *Dashboard* view is deprecated and is planned to be removed in a future release. You can use the *User workload vulnerabilities*, *Exception management*, *Platform vulnerabilities*, and *Node CVEs* views as alternatives.
