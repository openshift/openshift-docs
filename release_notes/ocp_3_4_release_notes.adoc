[[ocp-34-notable-technical-changes]]
== Notable Technical Changes

{product-title} 3.4 introduces the following notable technical changes.

[[ocp-34-updated-infrastructure-components]]
*Updated Infrastructure Components*

- Kubernetes has been updated to v1.4.

- {product-title} 3.4 requires Docker 1.12.

- etcd has been updated to 3.1.0-rc.0.
+
While etcd has been updated from etcd 2 to 3, {product-title} 3.4 continues to
use the etcd v2 API for both new and upgraded clusters.

- The latest EFK stack now uses Elasticsearch 2.4 with a common data model. This
means Fluentd sends logs to Elasticsearch with a new indexing pattern for
projects. The pattern is:
+
----
project.{namespace_name}.{namespace_id}.YYYY.MM.DD
----
+
For example:
+
----
project.logging.5dad9bd0-a7a1-11e6-94a0-5254000db84b.2016.11.14
----
+
The pattern for the `operations` logs remains the same.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Downgrading from Elasticsearch 2.4 to Elasticsearch 1.x is not possible due to
migration to a new data structure.
