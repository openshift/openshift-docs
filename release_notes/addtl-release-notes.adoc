Purpose: A compilation of links to release notes for additional related components, products, or Operators not included in the core OCP release notes.

**This file on the `main` branch is a stub, included only to allow builds to work.**

Do not add or edit this file here on the `main` branch. Edit the `addtl-release-notes.adoc` file directly in the branch that a change is relevant for. Changes to this file should be added or edited in their own PR, per version branch as needed.

This is because there might be different version compatabilities with OCP, or some components/products/Operators might not be available all for a given OCP version.
