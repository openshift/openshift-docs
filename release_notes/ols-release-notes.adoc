When running on {ocp-product-title} in FIPS mode, it uses the {rhel} cryptographic libraries submitted (or planned to be submitted) to NIST for FIPS validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390X` architectures. For more information about the NIST validation program, see link:https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules[Cryptographic Module Validation Program].
