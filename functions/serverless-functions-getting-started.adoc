Function lifecycle management includes creating and deploying a function, after which it can be invoked. You can do all of these operations on {ServerlessProductName} using the `kn func` tool.

[id="prerequisites_serverless-functions-getting-started"]
== Prerequisites

To enable the use of {FunctionsProductName} on your cluster, you must complete the following steps:

* The {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving are installed on your cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
Functions are deployed as a Knative service. If you want to use event-driven architecture with your functions, you must also install Knative Eventing.
====

* You have the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html#cli-getting-started[`oc` CLI] installed.

* You have the xref:../install/installing-kn.adoc#installing-kn[Knative (`kn`) CLI] installed. Installing the Knative CLI enables the use of `kn func` commands which you can use to create and manage functions.

* You have installed Docker Container Engine or Podman version 3.4.7 or higher.

* You have access to an available image registry, such as the OpenShift Container Registry.

* If you are using link:https://quay.io/[Quay.io] as the image registry, you must ensure that either the repository is not private, or that you have followed the {ocp-product-title} documentation on link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/openshift_images/managing_images/using-image-pull-secrets.html#images-allow-pods-to-reference-images-from-secure-registries_using-image-pull-secrets[Allowing pods to reference images from other secured registries].

* If you are using the OpenShift Container Registry, a cluster administrator must link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/registry/securing-exposing-registry.html#securing-exposing-registry[expose the registry].
