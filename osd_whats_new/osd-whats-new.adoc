toc::[]

With its foundation in Kubernetes, {product-title} is a complete {OCP} cluster provided as a cloud service, configured for high availability, and dedicated to a single customer.

{product-title} is professionally managed by Red Hat and hosted on {GCP} or {AWS}. Each {product-title} cluster includes a fully managed link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-version}/html/architecture/control-plane[control plane] (Control and Infrastructure nodes), application nodes, installation and management by Red Hat Site Reliability Engineers (SRE), premium Red Hat Support, and cluster services such as logging, metrics, monitoring, notifications portal, and a cluster portal.

{product-title} clusters are available on the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift[Hybrid Cloud Console]. With the Red Hat {cluster-manager} application, you can deploy {product-title} clusters to either on-premises or cloud environments.

== New changes and updates

[id="osd-q1-2025_{context}"]
=== Q1 2025

* **New version of {product-title} available.** {product-title} on {gcp} and {product-title} on {aws} versions 4.18 are now available. For more information about upgrading to this latest version, see xref:../upgrading/osd-upgrades.adoc#osd-upgrades[Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated cluster upgrades].

* **Cluster node limit update.** {product-title} clusters versions 4.14.14 and greater can now scale to 249 worker nodes. This is an increase from the previous limit of 180 nodes. For more information, see xref:../osd_planning/osd-limits-scalability.adoc#osd-limits-scalability[limits and scalability].
// * **{product-title} SDN network plugin blocks future major upgrades**
* **Initiate live migration from OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes.**
As part of the {product-title} move to OVN-Kubernetes as the only supported network plugin starting with {product-title} version 4.17, users can now initiate live migration from the OpenShift SDN network plugin to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.
+
If your cluster uses the OpenShift SDN network plugin, you cannot upgrade to future major versions of {product-title} without migrating to OVN-Kubernetes.
+
For more information about migrating to OVN-Kubernetes, see xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/migrate-from-openshift-sdn-osd.adoc#migrate-from-openshift-sdn[Migrating from OpenShift SDN network plugin to OVN-Kubernetes network plugin].


* **Red{nbsp}Hat SRE log-based alerting endpoints have been updated.** {product-title} customers who are using a firewall to control egress traffic can now remove all references to `*.osdsecuritylogs.splunkcloud.com:9997` from your firewall allowlist. {product-title} clusters still require the `http-inputs-osdsecuritylogs.splunkcloud.com:443` log-based alerting endpoint to be accessible from the cluster.

=== Q4 2024

* **Workload Identity Federation (WIF) authentication type is now available.** {product-title} on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) customers can now use WIF as an authentication type when creating a cluster. WIF is a GCP Identity and Access Management (IAM) feature that provides third parties a secure method to access resources on a customer's cloud account.
WIF is Google Cloud's preferred method for credential authentication.
+
For more information, see
xref:../osd_gcp_clusters/creating-a-gcp-cluster-with-workload-identity-federation.adoc[Creating a cluster on GCP with Workload Identity Federation authentication].

* **Private Service Connect (PSC) networking feature is now available.** You can now create a private {product-title} cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Google Cloud's security-enhanced networking feature Private Service Connect (PSC).
+
PSC is a capability of Google Cloud networking that enables private communication between services across different GCP projects or organizations. Implementing PSC as part of your network connectivity allows you to deploy OpenShift Dedicated clusters in a private and secured environment within GCP without using any public-facing cloud resources.
+
For more information, see  xref:../osd_gcp_clusters/creating-a-gcp-psc-enabled-private-cluster.adoc#creating-a-gcp-psc-enabled-private-cluster[Private Service Connect overview].

* ** Support for GCP A3 instances with NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs.** {product-title} on {GCP} now supports A3 instance types with NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs. The GCP A3 instance type is available in all three zones of a GCP region, which is a prerequisite for multi-AZ deployment. For more information, see xref:../osd_architecture/osd_policy/osd-service-definition.adoc#gcp-compute-types_osd-service-definition[Google Cloud compute types].


[id="osd-q3-2024_{context}"]
=== Q3 2024

* ** Support for GCP A2 instance types with A100 80GB GPUs.** {product-title} on {GCP} now supports A2 instance types with A100 80GB GPUs. These instance types meet the specific requirements listed by IBM Watsonx.ai. For more information, see xref:../osd_architecture/osd_policy/osd-service-definition.adoc#gcp-compute-types_osd-service-definition[Google Cloud compute types].


* **Expanded support for GCP standard instance types.** {product-title} on {GCP} now supports standard instance types for control plane and infrastructure nodes.
For more information, see xref:../osd_planning/osd-limits-scalability.adoc#control-plane-and-infra-node-sizing-and-scaling-sd_osd-limits-scalability[Control plane and infrastructure node sizing and scaling].

* **{product-title} regions added.** {product-title} on {GCP} is now available in the following additional regions:
+
--
** Melbourne (`australia-southeast2`)
** Milan (`europe-west8`)
** Turin (`europe-west12`)
** Madrid (`europe-southwest1`)
** Santiago (`southamerica-west1`)
** Doha (`me-central1`)
** Dammam (`me-central2`)

[id="osd-q2-2024_{context}"]
=== Q2 2024

* **Cluster delete protection.** {product-title} on {GCP}  users can now enable the cluster delete protection option, which helps to prevent users from accidentally deleting a cluster.

For more information on region availabilities, see xref:../osd_architecture/osd_policy/osd-service-definition.adoc#regions-availability-zones_osd-service-definition[Regions and availability zones].

* **Policy constraint update.** {product-title} on {GCP} users are now allowed to deploy clusters with the `constraints/iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains` constraint in place. This feature allows users to restrict the set of identities that are allowed to be used in Identity and Access Management policies, further enhancing overall security for their resources.

[id="osd-q4-2023_{context}"]
=== Q4 2023

* **Policy constraint update.** {product-title} on {GCP} users can now enable UEFISecureBoot during cluster installation, as required by the GCP ShieldVM policy. This new feature adds further protection from boot or kernel-level malware or rootkits.

* **Cluster install update.** {product-title} clusters can now be installed on {GCP} shared VPCs.

== Known issues
* {OCP} 4.14 introduced an updated HAProxy image from 2.2 to 2.6. This update created a change in behavior enforcing strict RFC 7230 compliance, rejecting requests with multiple `Transfer-Encoding` headers. This may cause exposed pods in {product-title} 4.14 clusters sending multiple `Transfer-Encoding` headers to respond with a `502 Bad Gateway` or `400 Bad Request error`. To avoid this issue, ensure that your applications are not sending multiple `Transfer-Encoding` headers. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7055002[Red Hat Knowledgebase article]. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-43095[*OCPBUGS-43095*])
