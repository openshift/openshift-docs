# This configuration file dictates the organization of the topic groups and
# topics on the main page of the doc site for this branch. Each record
# consists of the following:
#
# ---                                 <= Record delimiter
# Name: Origin of the Species         <= Display name of topic group
# Dir:  origin_of_the_species         <= Directory name of topic group
# Topics:
#   - Name: The Majestic Marmoset     <= Topic name
#     File: the_majestic_marmoset     <= Topic file under group dir +/- .adoc
#   - Name: The Curious Crocodile     <= Topic 2 name
#     File: the_curious_crocodile     <= Topic 2 file
#
# The ordering of the records in this document determines the ordering of the
# topic groups and topics on the main page.
