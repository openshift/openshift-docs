There are two types of {logging} updates: minor release updates (5.y.z) and major release updates (5.y).

== Minor release updates

If you installed the {logging} Operators using the *Automatic* update approval option, your Operators receive minor version updates automatically. You do not need to complete any manual update steps.

If you installed the {logging} Operators using the *Manual* update approval option, you must manually approve minor version updates. For more information, see xref:../operators/admin/olm-upgrading-operators.adoc#olm-approving-pending-upgrade_olm-upgrading-operators[Manually approving a pending Operator update].

[id="cluster-logging-upgrading-major"]
== Major release updates

For major version updates you must complete some manual steps.

For major release version compatibility and support information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift_operators#platform-agnostic[OpenShift Operator Life Cycles].
