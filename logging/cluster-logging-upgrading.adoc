After updating the {product-title} cluster from 4.4 to 4.5, you can then update the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator and Cluster Logging Operator from 4.4 to 4.5.

Cluster logging 4.5 introduces a new Elasticsearch version, Elasticsearch 6.8.1, and an enhanced security plug-in, Open Distro for Elasticsearch. The new Elasticsearch version introduces a new Elasticsearch data model, where the Elasticsearch data is indexed only by type: infrastructure, application, and audit. Previously, data was indexed by type (infrastructure and application) and project. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because of the new data model, the update does not migrate existing custom Kibana index patterns and visualizations into the new version. You must re-create your Kibana index patterns and visualizations to match the new indices after updating.
====

Due to the nature of these changes, you are not required to update your cluster logging to 4.5. However, when you update to {product-title} 4.6, you must update cluster logging to 4.6 at that time.
