{product-title} versions 4.7 and 4.8 both support OpenShift Logging versions 5.0 and 5.1.

To upgrade from cluster logging in {product-title} version 4.6 and earlier to OpenShift Logging 5.x, you update the {product-title} cluster to version 4.7 or 4.8. Then, you update the following operators:

* From Elasticsearch Operator 4.x to OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator 5.x
* From Cluster Logging Operator 4.x to Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator 5.x

To upgrade from a previous version of OpenShift Logging to the current version, you update OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator and Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator to their current versions.
