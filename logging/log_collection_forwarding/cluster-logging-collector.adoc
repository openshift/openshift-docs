All supported modifications to the log collector can be performed though the `spec.collection` stanza in the `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR).

[id="cluster-logging-collector-fluentd-handling"]
== Fluentd log handling when the external log aggregator is unavailable

If your external logging aggregator becomes unavailable and cannot receive logs, Fluentd continues to collect logs and stores them in a buffer. When the log aggregator becomes available, log forwarding resumes, including the buffered logs. If the buffer fills completely, Fluentd stops collecting logs. {product-title} rotates the logs and deletes them. You cannot adjust the buffer size or add a persistent volume claim (PVC) to the Fluentd daemon set or pods.
