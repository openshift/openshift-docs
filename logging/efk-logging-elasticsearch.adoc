= Configuring Elasticsearch in {product-title}
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

{product-title} uses Elasticsearch (ES) to store and organize the log data.

You can add and remove nodes, configure storage for your Elasticsearch cluster, and 
define how shards are replicated across data nodes in the cluster, from full replication to no replication.

//Following paragraph also in modules/efk-logging-deploy-storage-considerations.adoc

Elasticsearch is a memory-intensive application. Each Elasticsearch node needs 16G of memory for both memory requests and CPU limits 
unless you specify otherwise the ClusterLogging custom resource. The initial set of {product-title} nodes might not be large enough 
to support the Elasticsearch cluster. You must add additional nodes to the  {product-title} cluster to run with the recommended
or higher memory. Each Elasticsearch node can operate with a lower memory setting though this is not recommended for production deployments.

[NOTE]
====
Procedures in this topic require your cluster to be in an unmanaged state. For more information, see xref:../logging/efk-logging-configuring.html#efk-logging-elasticsearch-management-state-changing-efk-logging-configuring[Changing the cluster logging management state].
