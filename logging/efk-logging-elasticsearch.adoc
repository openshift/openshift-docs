= Configuring Elasticsearch to store and organize log data
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

{product-title} uses Elasticsearch (ES) to store and organize log data.

You can configure your Elasticsearch deployment to:

* add and remove nodes, 
* configure storage for your Elasticsearch cluster,  
* define how shards are replicated across data nodes in the cluster, from full replication to no replication.

//Following paragraph also in modules/efk-logging-deploy-storage-considerations.adoc

Elasticsearch is a memory-intensive application. Each Elasticsearch node needs 16G of memory for both memory requests and CPU limits, 
unless you specify otherwise in the Cluster Logging Custom Resource. The initial set of {product-title} nodes might not be large enough 
to support the Elasticsearch cluster. You must add additional nodes to the  {product-title} cluster to run with the recommended
or higher memory. 

Each Elasticsearch node can operate with a lower memory setting, but this is not recommended for production deployments.

[NOTE]
====
You must set your cluster to the unmanaged state before performing these configurations, unless otherwise noted. For more information, see xref:../logging/efk-logging-management.adoc#efk-logging-management[Changing the cluster logging management state].
