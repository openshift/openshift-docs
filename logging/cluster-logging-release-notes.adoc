== Making open source more inclusive

Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language[Red Hat CTO Chris Wrightâ€™s message].

[id="cluster-logging-release-notes-5-2-0"]
== OpenShift Logging 5.2.0

This release includes link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-TBD[RHSA-TBD OpenShift Logging Bug Fix Release 5.2.0].

[id="openshift-logging-5-2-0-new-features-and-enhancements"]
=== New features and enhancements

* With this update, if you use the Fluentd forward protocol to forward log data over a TLS-encrypted connection, you can now use a password-encrypted private key file and specify the passphrase in the Cluster Log Forwarder configuration. For more information, see xref:../logging/cluster-logging-external.html#cluster-logging-collector-log-forward-fluentd_cluster-logging-external[Forwarding logs using the Fluentd forward protocol]. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1525[LOG-1525])

* This enhancement enables you to use a username and password to authenticate a log forwarding connection to an external Elasticsearch instance. For example, if you cannot use mutual TLS (mTLS) because a third-party operates the Elasticsearch instance, you can use HTTP or HTTPS and set a secret that contains the username and password. For more information see xref:../logging/cluster-logging-external.adoc#cluster-logging-collector-log-forward-es_cluster-logging-external[Forwarding logs to an external Elasticsearch instance]. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1022[LOG-1022])

=== Bug fixes

* TBD-description
(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-TBD[LOG-TBD])

* In previous releases, if you redeployed a full OpenShift Logging-managed Elasticsearch cluster, it might become stuck in an unhealthy state, with one non-data node running and all other data nodes shut down. This was caused by new certificates preventing the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator from scaling down the non-data nodes of the Elasticsearch cluster. With this update, The OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator can scale all the data and non-data nodes down and then back up again, so that the nodes can load the new certificates. The OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator can reach the new nodes after they load the new certificates.
