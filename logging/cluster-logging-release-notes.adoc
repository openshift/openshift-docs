== Supported versions

* OpenShift Logging versions 5.0, 5.1, and 5.2 run on {product-title} versions 4.7 and 4.8.

[id="openshift-logging-inclusive-language"]
== Making open source more inclusive

Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language[Red Hat CTO Chris Wrightâ€™s message].

[id="openshift-logging-5-2-0-new-features-and-enhancements"]
=== New features and enhancements

* With this update, you can forward log data to Amazon CloudWatch, which provides application and infrastructure monitoring. For more information, see xref:../logging/cluster-logging-external.html#cluster-logging-collector-log-forward-cloudwatch_cluster-logging-external[Forwarding logs to Amazon CloudWatch]. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1173[LOG-1173])

* With this update, you can forward log data to Grafana Loki, a horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant log aggregation system. For more information, see xref:../logging/cluster-logging-external.html#cluster-logging-collector-log-forward-loki_cluster-logging-external[Forwarding logs to Grafana Loki]. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-684[LOG-684])

* With this update, if you use the Fluentd forward protocol to forward log data over a TLS-encrypted connection, you can now use a password-encrypted private key file and specify the passphrase in the Cluster Log Forwarder configuration. For more information, see xref:../logging/cluster-logging-external.html#cluster-logging-collector-log-forward-fluentd_cluster-logging-external[Forwarding logs using the Fluentd forward protocol]. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1525[LOG-1525])

* This enhancement enables you to use a username and password to authenticate a log forwarding connection to an external Elasticsearch instance. For example, if you cannot use mutual TLS (mTLS) because a third-party operates the Elasticsearch instance, you can use HTTP or HTTPS and set a secret that contains the username and password. For more information see xref:../logging/cluster-logging-external.adoc#cluster-logging-collector-log-forward-es_cluster-logging-external[Forwarding logs to an external Elasticsearch instance]. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1022[LOG-1022])

* With this update, you can collect OVN network policy audit logs for forwarding to a logging server. For more information, see xref:../logging/cluster-logging-external.html#cluster-logging-collecting-ovn-audit-logs_cluster-logging-external[Collecting OVN network policy audit logs]. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1526[LOG-1526])

* By default, the data model introduced in {product-title} 4.5 gave logs from different namespaces a single index in common. This change made it harder to see which namespaces produced the most logs.
+
The current release, OpenShift Logging 5.2, adds namespace metrics to the *Logging* dashboard in the {product-title} console. With these metrics, you can see which namespaces produce logs and how many logs each namespace produces for a given timestamp.
+
To see these metrics, open the *Administrator* perspective in the {product-title} web console, and navigate to *Monitoring* -> *Dashboards* -> *Logging/Elasticsearch*. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1680[LOG-1680])

* The current release, OpenShift Logging 5.2, enables two new metrics: For a given timestamp or duration, you can see the total logs produced or logged by individual containers, and the total logs collected by the collector. These metrics are labeled by namespace, pod, and container name, so you can see how many logs each namespace and pod collects and produces. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1213[LOG-1213])

[id="openshift-logging-5-2-0-known-issues"]
=== Known issues

* If you forward logs to an external Elasticsearch server and then change a configured value in the pipeline secret, such as the username and password, the fluentd forwarder loads the new secret but uses the old value to connect to an external Elasticsearch server. This issue happens because the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator does not currently monitor secrets for content changes. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1652[LOG-1652])
+
As a workaround, if you change the secret, you can force the Fluentd pods to redeploy by entering:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete pod -l component=fluentd
