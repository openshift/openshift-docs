toc::[]

When opening a support case, it is helpful to provide debugging information about your cluster to Red Hat Support.

The xref:../../support/gathering-cluster-data.adoc#gathering-cluster-data[`must-gather` tool] enables you to collect diagnostic information for project-level resources, cluster-level resources, and each of the cluster logging components.

For prompt support, supply diagnostic information for both {product-title} and cluster logging.

[NOTE]
====
Do not use the `hack/logging-dump.sh` script. The script is no longer supported and does not collect data.
