You can view the logs for various resources, such as builds, deployments, and pods by using the OpenShift CLI (oc) and the web console. 

[NOTE]
====
Resource logs are a default feature that provides limited log viewing capability. To enhance your log retrieving and viewing experience, it is recommended that you install xref:../logging/cluster-logging.adoc#cluster-logging[OpenShift Logging]. OpenShift Logging aggregates all the logs from your {product-title} cluster, such as node system audit logs, application container logs, and infrastructure logs, into a dedicated log store.  You can then query, discover, and visualize your log data through the xref:../logging/cluster-logging-visualizer.adoc#cluster-logging-visualizer-using[Kibana interface]. Resource logs do not access the OpenShift Logging log store.
