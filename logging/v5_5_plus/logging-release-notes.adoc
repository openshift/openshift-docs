The {logging-title} is provided as an installable component, with a distinct release cycle from the core {product-title}. The link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#logging[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy] outlines release compatibility.

[NOTE]
====
The `stable` channel only provides updates to the most recent release of logging. To continue receiving updates for prior releases, you must change your subscription channel to `stable-X` where `X` is the version of logging you have installed.
