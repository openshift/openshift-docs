= Forwarding logs to third-party systems

toc::[]


You can configure cluster logging to send logs to destinations outside of your {product-title} cluster instead of the default Elasticsearch log store using a ConfigMap:

* *Sending logs using the Fluentd forward protocol.* You can create a ConfigMap to use the xref:#cluster-logging-collector-fluentd_cluster-logging-external-configmap[Fluentd *forward* protocol] to securely send logs to an external logging aggregator that accepts the Fluent *forward* protocol.
* *Sending logs using syslog.* You can create a ConfigMap to use the xref:#cluster-logging-collector-syslog_cluster-logging-external-configmap[syslog protocol] to send logs to an external syslog (RFC 3164) server.

[NOTE]
====
Manually configuring a ConfigMap to forward logs will be deprecated when the xref:../logging/cluster-logging-external.adoc#cluster-logging-external[Log Forwarding API] reaches General Availability (GA) status and will be removed in a future release.
