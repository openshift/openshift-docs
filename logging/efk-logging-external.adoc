toc::[]

You can send Elasticsearch logs to external devices, such as an externally-hosted Elasticsearch instance
or an external syslog server. You can also configure Fluentd to send logs to an external log aggregator. 

[NOTE]
====
You must set cluster logging to Unmanaged state before performing these configurations, unless otherwise noted. For more information, see xref:../logging/efk-logging-management.adoc#efk-logging-management[Changing the cluster logging management state].
