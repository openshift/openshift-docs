You can configure the CPU and memory limits for the log collector and xref:../../logging/config/cluster-logging-moving-nodes.adoc#cluster-logging-moving[move the log collector pods to specific nodes]. All supported modifications to the log collector can be performed though the `spec.collection.log.fluentd` stanza in the `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR).
