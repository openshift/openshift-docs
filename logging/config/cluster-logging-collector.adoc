{product-title} uses Fluentd to collect operations and application logs from your cluster which {product-title} enriches with Kubernetes Pod and Namespace metadata.

You can configure log rotation, log location, use an external log aggregator, and make other configurations for the log collector.

[NOTE]
====
You must set cluster logging to Unmanaged state before performing these configurations, unless otherwise noted.
For more information, see xref:../../logging/config/cluster-logging-management.adoc#cluster-logging-management[Changing the cluster logging management state].
