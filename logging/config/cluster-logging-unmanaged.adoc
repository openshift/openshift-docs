= Unsupported configurations
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]





The supported way of configuring {product-title} cluster logging is by configuring it using the options described in this documentumentation. *Do not use other configurations, as they are unsupported.* Configuration paradigms might change across {product-title} releases, and such cases can only be handled gracefully if all configuration possibilities are controlled. If you use configurations other than those described in this documentation, your changes will disappear because the cluster-monitoring-operator reconciles any differences. The operator reverses everything to the defined state by default and by design.

You must set the operator to the _unmanaged_ state in order to modify the components managed by the Cluster Logging Operator or the Elasticsearch Operator. An unmanaged cluster logging environment is not supported and does not receive updates until you return the Cluster Logging Operator to Managed state.

Explicitly unsupported cases include:

* *Configuring the collected log location*. You must set the cluster to `Unamanged` to change the location of the log collector output file, by default `/var/log/fluentd/fluentd.log`.

* *Throttling log collection*. You must set the cluster to `Unamanged` to throttle down the rate at which the logs are read in by the log collector

* *Configuring log collection JSON parsing*. You must set the cluster to `Unamanged` to format log messages in *JSON*. 

* *Configuring how the log collector normalizes logs*. You cannot modify default log normalization.

* *Configuring the logging collector using environment variables*. You must set the cluster to `Unamanged` to use environment variables to modify the log collector.

* *Configuring Curator in scripted deployments*. You must set the cluster to `Unamanged` to configure log curation in scripted deployments.

* *Using the Curator Action file*. You must set the cluster to `Unamanged` to use *Curator* ConfigMap to modify the Curator *action* file.

* *Deleting Curator Indices*. You must set the cluster to `Unamanged` to configure log curation to delete indices.
