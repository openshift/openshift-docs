= Using tolerations to control logging pod placement

toc::[]

You can use taints and tolerations to ensure that {logging} pods run on specific nodes and that no other workload can run on those nodes.

Taints and tolerations are simple `key:value` pair. A taint on a node instructs the node to repel all pods that do not tolerate the taint.

The `key` is any string, up to 253 characters and the `value` is any string up to 63 characters. The string must begin with a letter or number, and may contain letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, and underscores.
