= Using tolerations to control cluster logging pod placement
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

You can use taints and tolerations to ensure that cluster logging pods run 
on specific nodes and that no other workload can run on those nodes.

Taints and tolerations are simple `key:value` pair.  A taint on a node 
instructs the node to repel all pods that do not tolerate the taint.	

The `key` is any string, up to 253 characters and the `value` is any string up to 63 characters.
The string must begin with a letter or number, and may contain letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, and underscores.
