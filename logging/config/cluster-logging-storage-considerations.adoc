Elasticsearch is a memory-intensive application. The default {logging} installation deploys 16G of memory for both memory requests and memory limits.
The initial set of {product-title} nodes might not be large enough to support the Elasticsearch cluster. You must add additional nodes to the {product-title} cluster to run with the recommended or higher memory. Each Elasticsearch node can operate with a lower memory setting, though this is not recommended for production environments.
