= Forwarding cluster logs using Log Forwarding
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]


The cluster logging *Log Forwarding* feature enables administrators to configure custom pipelines to send your container and node logs to specific endpoints within or outside of your cluster. You can send logs by type to the internal {product-title} Elasticsearch instance and/or remote destinations not managed by {product-title} cluster logging, such as your existing logging service, an external Elasticsearch cluster, external log aggregation solutions, or a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system.

:FeatureName: Log Forwarding
include::modules/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

Log Forwarding provides an easier way to forward logs to specific endpoints inside or outside your {product-title} cluster than using the xref:../../logging/config/cluster-logging-external.adoc#cluster-logging-external[Fluentd plugins].

[NOTE]
====
The Log Forwarding feature is optional. If you do not want to forward logs and use only the internal {product-title} Elasticsearch instance, do not configure the Log Forwarding feature. 
====

You can send different types of logs to different systems allowing you to control who in your organization can access each type. Optional TLS support ensures that you can send logs using secure communication as required by your organization.

Alternatively, you can use Fluentd plugins to forward logs. For more information, see xref:../../logging/config/cluster-logging-external.adoc#cluster-logging-external[Sending logs to external devices using Fluentd plugins].
