toc::[]

{product-title} uses Elasticsearch 6 (ES) to store and organize the log data.

You can make modifications to your log store, including:

* storage for your Elasticsearch cluster
* shard replication across data nodes in the cluster, from full replication to no replication
* external access to Elasticsearch data

//Following paragraph also in modules/cluster-logging-deploy-storage-considerations.adoc

Elasticsearch is a memory-intensive application. Each Elasticsearch node needs 16G of memory for both memory requests and limits,
unless you specify otherwise in the `ClusterLogging` custom resource. The initial set of {product-title} nodes might not be large enough
to support the Elasticsearch cluster. You must add additional nodes to the {product-title} cluster to run with the recommended
or higher memory.

Each Elasticsearch node can operate with a lower memory setting, though this is not recommended for production environments.
