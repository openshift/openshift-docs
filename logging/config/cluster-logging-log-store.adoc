{product-title} uses Elasticsearch 6 (ES) to store and organize the log data.

Some of the modifications you can make to your log store include:

* storage for your Elasticsearch cluster;  
* how shards are replicated across data nodes in the cluster, from full replication to no replication;
* allowing external access to Elasticsearch data. 

[NOTE]
====
Scaling down Elasticsearch nodes is not supported. When scaling down, Elasticsearch pods can be accidentally deleted,  
possibly resulting in shards not being allocated and replica shards being lost.

Elasticsearch is a memory-intensive application. Each Elasticsearch node needs 16G of memory for both memory requests and limits, 
unless you specify otherwise in the Cluster Logging Custom Resource. The initial set of {product-title} nodes might not be large enough 
to support the Elasticsearch cluster. You must add additional nodes to the {product-title} cluster to run with the recommended
or higher memory. 

Each Elasticsearch node can operate with a lower memory setting though this is not recommended for production deployments.
