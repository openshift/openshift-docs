In {product-title} {product-version}, log curation is performed by Elasticsearch Curator, based on a xref:../../logging/config/cluster-logging-log-store.html#cluster-logging-elasticsearch-retention_cluster-logging-store[retention policy] that you define.

The Elasticsearch Curator tool removes Elasticsearch indices that use the data model prior to {product-title} 4.5. You can modify the Curator index retention policy for your old data.
