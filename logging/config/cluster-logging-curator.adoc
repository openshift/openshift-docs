toc::[]

You can configure log retention time. That is, you can specify how long the default Elasticsearch log store keeps indices by configuring a separate retention policy for each of the three log sources: infrastructure logs, application logs, and audit logs. For instructions, see xref:../../logging/config/cluster-logging-log-store.html#cluster-logging-elasticsearch-retention_cluster-logging-store[Configuring log retention time].

[NOTE]
====
Configuring log retention time is recommended method for curating log data: It works with both the current data model and the previous data model from {product-title} 4.4 and earlier.
====

Optionally, to remove Elasticsearch indices that use the data model from {product-title} 4.4 and earlier, you can also use the Elasticsearch Curator. The following sections explain how to use the Elasticsearch Curator.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Elasticsearch Curator is deprecated in {product-title} 4.7 (OpenShift Logging 5.0) and will be removed in OpenShift Logging 5.1.
