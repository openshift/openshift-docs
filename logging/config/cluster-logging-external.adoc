= Fowarding cluster logs using Fluentd plug-ins
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

{product-title} cluster logging allows you to send logs to destinations outside of your {product-title} cluster instead of the default Elasticsearch instance.

* *Sending logs using Fluentd*. You can use the Fluentd *out_forward* plug-in to securely send logs to another logging collector using the Fluent forward protocol. 

* *Sending logs using syslog*. You can use the Fluentd *syslog* plug-in to send logs to another logging collector using the syslog protocol (RFC 3164). Many logging collectors such as Fluentd, Rsyslog, and others support this protocol.

You can use the xref:../../logging/config/cluster-logging-log-forwarding.adoc#cluster-logging-log-forwarding[log forwarding feature], which can be easier to configure than the plug-ins. The log forwarding feature is currently in Technology Preview.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Changes that are introduced by the new log forwarding feature modified the support for the Fluentd *syslog* plug-in starting with the {product-title} 4.3 release. In {product-title} 4.3, you create a ConfigMap, as described below, to configure a Fluentd plug-in.
