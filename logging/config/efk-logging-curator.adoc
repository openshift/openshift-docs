toc::[]

The Elasticsearch Curator tool performs scheduled maintenance operations on a per-project basis. Curator performs actions daily based on its configuration. Only one Curator Pod is
recommended per Elasticsearch cluster.

The cluster logging installation creates a Curator configuration map, `curator` in the `openshift-logging` project, which incorporates the Curator configuration file, *_curator5.yaml_* and an {product-title} custom configuration file, *_config.yaml_*.

Optionally, you can use the actions file, *_actions.yaml_*, directly. Editing this file allows you to use any action that Curator has available to it to be run periodically. However, this is only recommended for advanced users as modifying the file can be destructive to the cluster and can cause removal of required indices/settings from Elasticsearch. Most users only need to modify the Curator configuration map and never edit the *action file*.
