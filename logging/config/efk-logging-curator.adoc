toc::[]

The Elasticsearch Curator tool performs scheduled maintenance operations on a per-project basis. Curator performs actions daily based on its configuration. The Cluster Logging Operator deploys one Curator pod and a Curator ConfigMap.

The Cluster Logging Operator installation creates a *Curator* ConfigMap in the `openshift-logging` project, which contains three sections: the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/5.2/actionfile.html[Curator *action* file], a `config.yaml` file, and a `curator5` file.  

* *curator5.yaml*. The Curator configuration file for general configuration, such as the Elasticsearch hostname, client connection details, and the path to certificates.
* *config.yaml*. A {product-title} configuration file for Curator that uses an easier format. Supports only the Curator *delete_indices* action
* *actions.yaml*. The Curator *action* file, empty by default. You can edit these parameters or provide your own *action* file. If you do not use these parameters, the `config.yaml` parameters are used. {product-title} converts the `config.yaml` parmeters into the *action* file format used by Curator.

The `curator5.yaml` and `actions` file are the {product-title} configuration files for curator 5.2. 

[NOTE]
====
The `actions.yaml` and `config.yaml` are mutually-exclusive configuration files.
