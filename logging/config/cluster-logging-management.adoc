= Changing cluster logging management state
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]


In order to modify certain components managed by the Cluster Logging Operator or the Elasticsearch Operator, you must set the operator to the _unmanaged_ state.

In unmanaged state, the operators do not respond to changes in the CRs. The administrator assumes full control of individual component configurations and upgrades when in unmanaged state.

In managed state, the Cluster Logging Operator (CLO) responds to changes in the Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR) and attempts to update the cluster to match the CR.

The {product-title} documentation indicates in a prerequisite step when you must set the cluster to Unmanaged.

[NOTE]
====
If you set the Elasticsearch Operator (EO) to unmanaged and leave the Cluster Logging Operator (CLO) as managed, the CLO will revert changes you make to the EO, as the EO is managed by the CLO.
