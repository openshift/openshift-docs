= Configuring Elasticsearch to store and organize log data
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

{product-title} uses Elasticsearch (ES) to store and organize the log data.

Some of the modifications you can make to your Elasticsearch deployment include:

* storage for your Elasticsearch cluster;  
* how shards are replicated across data nodes in the cluster, from full replication to no replication;
* allowing external access to Elasticsearch data. 

[NOTE]
====
Scaling down Elasticsearch nodes is not supported. When scaling down, Elasticsearch pods can be accidentally deleted,  
possibly resulting in shards not being allocated and replica shards being lost.
====

//Following paragraph also in modules/cluster-logging-deploy-storage-considerations.adoc

Elasticsearch is a memory-intensive application. Each Elasticsearch node needs 16G of memory for both memory requests and limits, 
unless you specify otherwise in the Cluster Logging Custom Resource. The initial set of {product-title} nodes might not be large enough 
to support the Elasticsearch cluster. You must add additional nodes to the {product-title} cluster to run with the recommended
or higher memory. 

Each Elasticsearch node can operate with a lower memory setting though this is not recommended for production deployments.

[NOTE]
====
If you set the Elasticsearch Operator (EO) to unmanaged and leave the Cluster Logging Operator (CLO) as managed, the CLO will revert changes you make to the EO, as the EO is managed by the CLO.
