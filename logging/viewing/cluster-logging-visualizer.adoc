= Viewing cluster logs using Kibana

toc::[]

{product-title} cluster logging includes a web console for visualizing collected log data. Currently, {product-title} deploys the Kibana console for visualization.

Using the log visualizer, you can:

* Search and browse your data using the *Discover* tab.
* Chart and map your data using the *Visualize* tab.
* Create and view custom dashboards using the *Dashboard* tab.

Use and configuration of the Kibana interface is beyond the scope of this documentation. For more information,
on using the interface, see the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/6.8/connect-to-elasticsearch.html[Kibana documentation]. 

[NOTE]
====
The audit logs are not stored in the internal {product-title} Elasticsearch instance by default. To view the audit logs in Kibana, you must use the xref:../../logging/config/cluster-logging-log-store.adoc#cluster-logging-elasticsearch-audit_cluster-logging-store[Log Forwarding API] to configure a pipeline that uses the `default` output for audit logs.
