The {logging-title} is an opinionated collector and normalizer of application, infrastructure, and audit logs. It is intended to be used for forwarding logs to various supported systems.

The {logging-title} is not:

* A high scale log collection system
* Security Information and Event Monitoring (SIEM) compliant
* Historical or long term log retention or storage
* A guaranteed log sink
* Secure storage - audit logs are not stored by default

== Collecting logging data for Red Hat Support

When opening a support case, it is helpful to provide debugging information about your cluster to Red{nbsp}Hat Support.

You can use the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
xref:../support/gathering-cluster-data.adoc#gathering-cluster-data[`must-gather` tool]
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/support/gathering-cluster-data.html#gathering-cluster-data[`must-gather` tool]
endif::[]
to collect diagnostic information for project-level resources, cluster-level resources, and each of the {logging} components.

For prompt support, supply diagnostic information for both {product-title} and the {logging-title}.

[NOTE]
====
Do not use the `hack/logging-dump.sh` script. The script is no longer supported and does not collect data.
