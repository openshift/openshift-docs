The {logging-title} is an opinionated collector and normalizer of application, infrastructure, and audit logs. It is intended to be used for forwarding logs to various supported systems.

The {logging-title} is not:

* A high scale log collection system
* Security Information and Event Monitoring (SIEM) compliant
* Historical or long term log retention or storage
* A guaranteed log sink
* Secure storage - audit logs are not stored by default
