= Collecting and storing Kubernetes events
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

The {product-title} Event Router is a Pod that watches Kubernetes events and logs them for collection by cluster logging. You must manually deploy the Event Router.

The Event Router collects events from all projects and writes them to `STDOUT`. Fluentd collects those events and forwards them into the {product-title} Elasticsearch instance. Elasticsearch indexes the events to the `infra` index. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Event Router adds additional load to Fluentd and can impact the number of other log messages that can be processed.
