// For example:
// * file name: assembly_my-assembly-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='assembly_my-assembly-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My assembly A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module.
// Avoid changing it after the module has been published
// to ensure existing links are not broken.
//
// In order for  the assembly to be reusable in other assemblies in a guide,
// include {context} in the ID: [id='a-collection-of-modules_{context}'].
//
// If the assembly covers a task, start the title with a verb in the gerund
// form, such as Creating or Configuring.
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID
// includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if
// it is reused multiple times in a guide.

By default, the *json-file* log driver is used by default for Docker in {product-title} as of {product-title} 3.9.
However, if you have upgraded from {product-title} 3.7, your cluster might be configured to use the *journald* log driver configuration. 

If you are using EFK logging, you should use the *json-file* log driver.

// The following include statements pull in the module files that comprise
