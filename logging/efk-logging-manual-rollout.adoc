= Manually rolling out Elasticsearch
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]



{product0title} is configured so that the Elasticsearch
Deployment Config object does not have a Config Change Trigger, meaning
any changes to the deployment configuration does not result in an automatic rollout. This prevents
unintended restarts happening in the Elasticsearch cluster, which could create excessive shard
rebalancing as cluster members restart.

This section presents two restart procedures: rolling-restart and full-restart. Where a rolling restart
applies appropriate changes to the Elasticsearch cluster without down time
(provided three masters are configured) and a full restart safely applies major
changes without risk to existing data.
