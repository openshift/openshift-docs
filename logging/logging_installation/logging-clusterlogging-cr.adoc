toc::[]

After you have installed the Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Logging Operator, you must create a `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR). The `ClusterLogging` CR schedules logging subsystem pods and other resources necessary to support the logging subsystem. You can also use the `ClusterLogging` CR to configure the log store, visualization, and collector for your logging deployment.

The `ClusterLogging` CR provides information to Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Logging Operator, which triggers the deployment of the collector and forwarder. The Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Logging Operator watches the `ClusterLogging` CR and adjusts the logging deployment accordingly.

<1> The name must be `instance`.
<2> The OpenShift Logging management state. In some cases, if you change the OpenShift Logging defaults, you must set this to `Unmanaged`.
However, an unmanaged deployment does not receive updates until OpenShift Logging is placed back into a managed state.
<3> Optional. Settings for configuring Elasticsearch. Using the CR, you can configure shard replication policy and persistent storage.

[NOTE]
====
If you do not want to use the default Elasticsearch log store, you can remove the internal Elasticsearch `logStore` and Kibana `visualization` components from the `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR). Removing these components is optional but saves resources. For more information, see xref:../../logging/config/cluster-logging-log-store.adoc#cluster-logging-removing-unused-components-if-no-elasticsearch_cluster-logging-log-store[Removing unused components if you do not use the default Elasticsearch log store].
====
<4> Specify the length of time that Elasticsearch should retain each log source. Enter an integer and a time designation: weeks(w), hours(h/H), minutes(m) and seconds(s). For example, `7d` for seven days. Logs older than the `maxAge` are deleted. You must specify a retention policy for each log source or the Elasticsearch indices will not be created for that source.
<5> Specify the number of Elasticsearch nodes. See the note that follows this list.
<6> Enter the name of an existing storage class for Elasticsearch storage. For best performance, specify a storage class that allocates block storage. If you do not specify a storage class, OpenShift Logging uses ephemeral storage.
<7> Specify the CPU and memory requests for Elasticsearch as needed. If you leave these values blank, the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator sets default values that should be sufficient for most deployments. The default values are `16Gi` for the memory request and `1` for the CPU request.
<8> Specify the CPU and memory requests for the Elasticsearch proxy as needed. If you leave these values blank, the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator sets default values that should be sufficient for most deployments. The default values are `256Mi` for the memory request and `100m` for the CPU request.
<9> Settings for configuring Kibana. Using the CR, you can scale Kibana for redundancy and configure the CPU and memory for your Kibana nodes.

The maximum number of Elasticsearch control plane nodes is three. If you specify a `nodeCount` greater than `3`, {product-title} creates three Elasticsearch nodes that are Master-eligible nodes, with the master, client, and data roles. The additional Elasticsearch nodes are created as Data-only nodes, using client and data roles. Control plane nodes perform cluster-wide actions such as creating or deleting an index, shard allocation, and tracking nodes. Data nodes hold the shards and perform data-related operations such as CRUD, search, and aggregations. Data-related operations are I/O-, memory-, and CPU-intensive. It is important to monitor these resources and to add more Data nodes if the current nodes are overloaded.

For example, if `nodeCount=4`, the following nodes are created:

The number of primary shards for the index templates is equal to the number of Elasticsearch data nodes.
