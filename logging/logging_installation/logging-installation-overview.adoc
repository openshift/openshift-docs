Administrators can deploy the {logging} by using Operators. Operators are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application. See xref:../../operators/understanding/olm-what-operators-are.adoc#olm-what-operators-are[What are Operators?] for more information.

Administrators can use the {product-title} web console or the {oc-first} to install the {logging} Operators. The Operators are responsible for deploying, upgrading, and maintaining the {logging}. After the Operators are installed, you can configure your {logging} deployment by using custom resources (CRs).

[IMPORTANT]
====
For new installations, Vector and LokiStack are recommended. Documentation for logging is in the process of being updated to reflect these underlying component changes.

xref:../../logging/logging_installation/logging-install-logging-operator.adoc#logging-install-logging-operator[Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Logging Operator]:: The Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Logging Operator deploys the core logging components, and provides the `ClusterLogging` and `ClusterLogForwarder` custom resource definitions (CRDs). This Operator is required if you want to use logging on {product-title}.

xref:../../logging/log_storage/logging-installing-loki-operator.adoc#logging-installing-loki-operator[Loki Operator]:: The Loki Operator provides the Loki log store and the `LokiStack` CRD. You can create a `LokiStack` CR to control the Loki cluster as log store and the web proxy with {product-title} authentication integration to enforce multi-tenancy. The Loki Operator is optional, and only needs to be installed if you want to use Loki for log storage.

xref:../../logging/log_storage/logging-install-es-operator.adoc#logging-install-es-operator[OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator]:: The OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator provide the Elasticsearch log store, and generates and manages the `ElasticSearch` and `Kibana` CRs. Manual changes cannot be made without being overwritten by the Operator. The `ElasticSearch` CR configures an Elasticsearch instance as the default log store. The `Kibana` CR configures Kibana instance to search, query and view logs. The OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator is optional, and only needs to be installed if you want to use Elasticsearch for log storage.
