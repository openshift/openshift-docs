You can install cluster logging by deploying
the Elasticsearch and Cluster Logging Operators. The Elasticsearch Operator
creates and manages the Elasticsearch cluster used by cluster logging. 
The Cluster Logging Operator creates and manages the components of the logging stack. 

The process for deploying cluster logging to {product-title} involves:

* Reviewing the xref:../logging/config/cluster-logging-storage-considerations#cluster-logging-storage[cluster logging storage considerations].

* Installing the Elasticsearch Operator and Cluster Logging Operator using the {product-title} xref:../logging/cluster-logging-deploying.adoc#cluster-logging-deploy-console_cluster-logging-deploying[web console] or xref:../logging/cluster-logging-deploying.adoc#cluster-logging-deploy-cli_cluster-logging-deploying[CLI].

// The following include statements pull in the module files that comprise
// the assembly. Include any combination of concept, procedure, or reference
// modules required to cover the user story. You can also include other
// assemblies.
