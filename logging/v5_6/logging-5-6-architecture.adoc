The {logging} contains 4 logical components:

* `Collector` - Reads container log data from each node.

* `Forwarder` -	Forwards log data to configured outputs.

* `Store` - Stores log data for analysis; the default output for the forwarder.

* `Visualization` - GUI to search, query, and view stored logs.

These components are managed by Operators, and Custom Resource (CR) YAML files.

Either collector uses the following sources:

* journald for all system logs
* `/var/log/pods/*.log` for all container logs

If you configure your log collector to collect audit logs, it gets them from `/var/log/audit/audit.log`. Audit logs from the Kubernetes API server are stored in the `/var/log/kube-apiserver/audit.log` file. Audit logs from the OpenShift API server are stored in the `/var/log/openshift-apiserver/audit.log` file. OVN logs are collected if available.

The logging collector is a daemon set that deploys pods to each {product-title} node. System and infrastructure logs are generated by journald log messages from the operating system, the container runtime, and {product-title}. Node logs are generated by the node filesystem. Container logs are generated by the CRI-O container engine. The collector collects the logs from these sources and forwards them internally or externally as configured in the `ClusterLogForwarder` custom resource.
