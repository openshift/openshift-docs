The {logging-title} aggregates the following types of logs:

* `application` - Container logs generated by user applications running in the cluster, in any namespace other than: `default`, `openshift*`, `kube*`.

* `infrastructure` - Logs generated by infrastructure components running in the cluster and {product-title} nodes, such as journal logs. Infrastructure components are pods that run in the `openshift*`, `kube*`, or `default` projects.

* `audit` - Logs generated by auditd, the node audit system, are stored in the `/var/log/audit/audit.log` file.

The {logging} contains 4 logical components:

Collector:: Reads container log data from each node.

Forwarder::	Forwards log data to configured outputs.

Store:: Stores log data for analysis; the default output for the forwarder.

Exploration:: GUI and command line UI tools to search, query, and view stored logs.

These components are managed by Operators, and Custom Resource (CR) YAML files.
