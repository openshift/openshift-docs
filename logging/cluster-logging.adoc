As a cluster administrator, you can deploy the {logging} to
aggregate all the logs from your {product-title} cluster, such as node system audit logs, application container logs, and infrastructure logs.
The {logging} aggregates these logs from throughout your cluster and stores them in a default log store. You can xref:../logging/cluster-logging-visualizer.adoc#cluster-logging-visualizer[use the Kibana web console to visualize log data].

The {logging} aggregates the following types of logs:

* `application` - Container logs generated by user applications running in the cluster, except infrastructure container applications.
* `infrastructure` - Logs generated by infrastructure components running in the cluster and {product-title} nodes, such as journal logs. Infrastructure components are pods that run in the `openshift*`, `kube*`, or `default` projects.
* `audit` - Logs generated by auditd, the node audit system, which are stored in the */var/log/audit/audit.log* file, and the audit logs from the Kubernetes apiserver and the OpenShift apiserver.

[NOTE]
====
Because the internal {product-title} Elasticsearch log store does not provide secure storage for audit logs, audit logs are not stored in the internal Elasticsearch instance by default. If you want to send the audit logs to the default internal Elasticsearch log store, for example to view the audit logs in Kibana, you must use the Log Forwarding API as described in xref:../logging/config/cluster-logging-log-store.adoc#cluster-logging-elasticsearch-audit_cluster-logging-store[Forward audit logs to the log store].
