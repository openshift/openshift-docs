ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
As an {product-title} administrator, you can deploy cluster logging to
aggregate logs for a range of {product-title} services.

Cluster logging runs on worker nodes. As an {product-title} administrator, you
can monitor resource consumption in the console and via Prometheus and Grafana.
Due to the high work load required for logging, more worker nodes may be
required for your environment.

Logs in {product-title} are retained for two days before rotation. Logging
storage is capped at 600GiB. This is independent of a cluster's allocated base
storage.
