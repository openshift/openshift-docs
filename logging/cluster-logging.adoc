= About Logging
:context: cluster-logging

toc::[]

As a cluster administrator, you can deploy {logging} on an {product-title} cluster, and use it to collect and aggregate node system audit logs, application container logs, and infrastructure logs. You can forward logs to your chosen log outputs, including on-cluster, Red{nbsp}Hat managed log storage.

[WARNING]
====
If you are using an internal Elasticsearch log store, audit logs are not sent to the log store by default. The Elasticsearch internal log store does not provide secure storage for audit logs. Configuring an internal Elasticsearch log store instance to receive audit logs may cause audit logs to be dropped and not collected.
====

You can visualize your log data in the {product-title} web console, or the Kibana web console, depending on your deployed log storage solution.

include::snippets/logging-kibana-dep-snip.adoc[]

{product-title} cluster administrators can deploy the {logging} by using Operators. For information, see xref:../logging/cluster-logging-deploying.adoc#cluster-logging-deploying[Installing the {logging-title}].

The Operators are responsible for deploying, upgrading, and maintaining the {logging}. After the Operators are installed, you can create a `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR) to schedule {logging} pods and other resources necessary to support the {logging}. You can also create a `ClusterLogForwarder` CR to specify which logs are collected, how they are transformed, and where they are forwarded to.
