= Forwarding logs to third party systems
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]


By default, {product-title} cluster logging sends logs to the default internal Elasticsearch log store, defined in the Cluster Logging Custom Resource. If you want to forward logs to other log aggregators, you can use the {product-title} Log Forwarding API to send container, infrastructure, and audit logs to specific endpoints within or outside your cluster. You can send different types of logs to different systems allowing you to control who in your organization can access each type. Optional TLS support ensures that you can send logs using secure communication as required by your organization.

When you forward logs externally, the Cluster Logging Operator creates or modifies a Fluentd ConfigMap to send logs using your desired protocols. You are responsible for configuring the protocol on the external log aggregator.

If you want to forward logs to only the internal {product-title} Elasticsearch instance, do not configure the Log Forwarding API.

[NOTE]
====
Because the internal {product-title} Elasticsearch log store does not provide secure storage for audit logs, audit logs are not stored in the internal Elasticsearch instance by default. If you want to send the audit logs to the internal log store, for example to view the audit logs in Kibana, you must use the Log Forwarding API as described in xref:../logging/config/cluster-logging-log-store.adoc#cluster-logging-elasticsearch-audit_cluster-logging-store[Forward audit logs to the log store].
====

Alternatively, you can create a ConfigMap to use the xref:../logging/cluster-logging-external.html#cluster-logging-collector-legacy-fluentd_cluster-logging-external[Fluentd *forward* protocol] or the xref:../logging/cluster-logging-external.html#cluster-logging-collector-legacy-syslog_cluster-logging-external[syslog protocol] to send logs to external systems. However, these methods for forwarding logs are deprecated in {product-title} and will be removed in a future release. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot use the ConfigMap methods and the Log Forwarding API in the same cluster.
