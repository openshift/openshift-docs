= Forwarding logs using the Log Forwarding API
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

You can configure cluster logging to send logs to destinations outside of your {product-title} cluster instead of the default Elasticsearch log store using the Log Forwarding API. By default, {product-title} cluster logging sends logs to the default internal Elasticsearch log store, defined in the Cluster Logging Custom Resource.

The Log Forwarding API enables you to configure custom pipelines to send container and node logs to specific endpoints within or outside of your cluster. You can send logs by type to the internal {product-title} Elasticsearch instance and to remote destinations not managed by {product-title} cluster logging, such as an existing logging service, an external Elasticsearch cluster, an external log aggregation solution, or a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. 

You can send different types of logs to different systems allowing you to control who in your organization can access each type. Optional TLS support ensures that you can send logs using secure communication as required by your organization. 

When you use the Log Forwarding API, the Cluster Logging Operator creates or modifies a Fluentd ConfigMap to send logs using the Fluentd *forward* protocol. You are responsible to configure the protocol on the external log aggregator. 

[NOTE]
====
Using the Log Forwarding API is optional. If you want to forward logs to only the internal {product-title} Elasticsearch instance, do not configure the Log Forwarding API.
