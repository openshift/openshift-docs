= Forwarding logs to third party systems
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]


By default, {product-title} cluster logging sends logs to the default internal Elasticsearch log store, defined in the Cluster Logging Custom Resource. You can congifure the {product-title} Log Forwarding API to send container and node logs to specific endpoints within or outside your cluster. You can send different types of logs to different systems allowing you to control who in your organization can access each type. Optional TLS support ensures that you can send logs using secure communication as required by your organization.

When you forward logs externally, the Cluster Logging Operator creates or modifies a Fluentd ConfigMap to send logs using your desired protocols. You are responsible to configure the protocol on the external log aggregator.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to forward logs to only the internal OpenShift Container Platform Elasticsearch instance, do not configure the Log Forwarding API.
====

Alternatively, you can xref:#cluster-logging-collector-legacy_cluster-logging-external[create a ConfigMap] to use the Fluentd *forward* protocol or the syslog protocol to send logs to an external systems. However, these methods for forwarding logs are deprecated in {product-title} and will be removed in a future release.
