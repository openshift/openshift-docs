= Forwarding logs to external third-party logging systems
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

By default, OpenShift Logging sends container and infrastructure logs to the default internal Elasticsearch log store defined in the `ClusterLogging` custom resource. However, it does not send audit logs to the internal store because it does not provide secure storage. If this default configuration meets your needs, you do not need to configure the Cluster Log Forwarder.

To send logs to other log aggregators, you use the {product-title} Cluster Log Forwarder. This API enables you to send container, infrastructure, and audit logs to specific endpoints within or outside your cluster. In addition, you can send different types of logs to various systems so that various individuals can access each type. You can also enable Transport Layer Security (TLS) support to send logs securely, as required by your organization.

[NOTE]
====
To send audit logs to the default internal Elasticsearch log store, use the Cluster Log Forwarder as described in xref:../logging/config/cluster-logging-log-store.adoc#cluster-logging-elasticsearch-audit_cluster-logging-store[Forward audit logs to the log store].
====

When you forward logs externally, the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator creates or modifies a Fluentd config map to send logs using your desired protocols. You are responsible for configuring the protocol on the external log aggregator.

Alternatively, you can create a config map to use the xref:../logging/cluster-logging-external.html#cluster-logging-collector-legacy-fluentd_cluster-logging-external[Fluentd *forward* protocol] or the xref:../logging/cluster-logging-external.html#cluster-logging-collector-legacy-syslog_cluster-logging-external[syslog protocol] to send logs to external systems. However, these methods for forwarding logs are deprecated in {product-title} and will be removed in a future release.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot use the config map methods and the Cluster Log Forwarder in the same cluster.
