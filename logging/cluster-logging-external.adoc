= Forwarding logs to third party systems
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

By default, {product-title} cluster logging sends logs to the default internal Elasticsearch log store, defined in the Cluster Logging Custom Resource.

You can configure cluster logging to send logs to destinations outside of your {product-title} cluster instead of the default Elasticsearch log store using the following methods:

* *Sending logs using the Fluentd forward protocol*. You can create a Configmap to use the xref:#cluster-logging-collector-fluentd_cluster-logging-external[Fluentd *forward* protocol] to securely send logs to an external logging aggregator that accepts the Fluent *forward* protocol.

* *Sending logs using syslog*. You can create a Configmap to use the xref:#cluster-logging-collector-syslog_cluster-logging-external[syslog protocol] to send logs to an external syslog (RFC 3164) server.

Alternatively, you can use the xref:#cluster-logging-collector-log-forward_cluster-logging-external[Log Forwarding API], currently in Technology Preview. The Log Forwarding API, which is easier to configure than the Fluentd protocol and syslog, exposes configuration for sending logs to the internal Elasticsearch log store and to external Fluentd log aggregation solutions. 

:FeatureName: The Log Forwarding API

The methods for forwarding logs using a ConfigMap are deprecated and will be replaced by the Log Forwarding API in a future release.
