= Forwarding logs to third party systems
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]


By default, {product-title} cluster logging sends logs to the default internal Elasticsearch log store, defined in the `ClusterLogging` custom resource. If you want to forward logs to other log aggregators, you can use the {product-title} Log Forwarding API to send container, infrastructure, and audit logs to specific endpoints within or outside your cluster. You can send different types of logs to different systems, allowing you to control who in your organization can access each type. Optional TLS support ensures that you can send logs using secure communication as required by your organization.

When you forward logs externally, the Cluster Logging Operator creates or modifies a Fluentd config map to send logs using your desired protocols. You are responsible for configuring the protocol on the external log aggregator.

If you want to forward logs to only the internal {product-title} Elasticsearch instance, do not configure the Log Forwarding API.

Alternatively, you can create a ConfigMap to use the xref:../logging/cluster-logging-external.html#cluster-logging-collector-legacy-fluentd_cluster-logging-external[Fluentd *forward* protocol] or the xref:../logging/cluster-logging-external.html#cluster-logging-collector-legacy-syslog_cluster-logging-external[syslog protocol] to send logs to external systems. However, these methods for forwarding logs are deprecated in {product-title} and will be removed in a future release. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot use the ConfigMap methods and the Log Forwarding API in the same cluster.
