[role="_abstract"]
Ensure reliable {ocp} monitoring by using only supported {cmo-first} configurations. Learn about the limitations and avoid losing unsupported changes due to automatic resets.

Not all configuration options for the monitoring stack are exposed. The only supported way to configure {ocp} monitoring is through the {cmo-full} by using the options in the xref:../config-map-reference/config-map-reference-for-the-cluster-monitoring-operator.adoc#cluster-monitoring-operator-configuration-reference[Config map reference for the {cmo-full}].

[WARNING]
====
Use of other configurations, which are not listed in the xref:../config-map-reference/config-map-reference-for-the-cluster-monitoring-operator.adoc#cluster-monitoring-operator-configuration-reference[Config map reference for the {cmo-full}], is not supported.
====

Configuration paradigms might change across Prometheus releases, and such cases can only be handled gracefully if all configuration possibilities are controlled. If you use configurations other than those described in the xref:../config-map-reference/config-map-reference-for-the-cluster-monitoring-operator.adoc#cluster-monitoring-operator-configuration-reference[Config map reference for the {cmo-full}], your changes will disappear because the {cmo-short} automatically reconciles any differences and resets any unsupported changes back to the originally defined state by default and by design.
