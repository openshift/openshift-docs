toc::[]

You can embed {product-title} into a {op-system-ostree-first} {op-system-version} image. Use the content within this section to build a {op-system} image containing {product-title}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Red Hat does not support an update path from Developer Preview and Technology Preview versions to later versions of {product-title}. A new installation is necessary.

== Preparing for image building

Familiarize yourself with the documentation about https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/composing_installing_and_managing_rhel_for_edge_images[Composing, installing, and managing RHEL for Edge images].

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} deployments have only been tested with {op-system-ostree-first} {op-system-version}. Other versions of {op-system} are not recommended.
====

To build an {op-system-ostree-first} {op-system-version} image for a given CPU architecture, you need a {op-system} {op-system-version} build host of the same CPU architecture that meets the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/composing_installing_and_managing_rhel_for_edge_images/setting-up-image-builder_composing-installing-managing-rhel-for-edge-images#edge-image-builder-system-requirements_setting-up-image-builder[Image Builder system requirements].

Follow the instructions in https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/composing_installing_and_managing_rhel_for_edge_images/setting-up-image-builder_composing-installing-managing-rhel-for-edge-images#edge-installing-image-builder_setting-up-image-builder[Installing Image Builder] to install Image Builder and the `composer-cli` tool.
