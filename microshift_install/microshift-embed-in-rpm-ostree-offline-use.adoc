toc::[]

Embedding {microshift-short} containers in an `rpm-ostree` commit means that you can run a cluster in air-gapped, disconnected, or offline environments. You can embed {product-title} containers in a {op-system-ostree-first} image so that container engines do not need to pull images over a network from a container registry. Workloads can start up immediately without network connectivity.
