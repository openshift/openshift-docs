This reference provides descriptions and example commands for OpenShift CLI (`oc`) commands. You must have `cluster-admin` or equivalent permissions to use these commands.

Run `oc adm -h` to list all administrator commands or run `oc <command> --help` to get additional details for a specific command.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Using `oc <command> --help` lists details for any `oc` command. Not all `oc` commands apply to using {product-title}.
