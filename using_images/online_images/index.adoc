The OpenShift Online Developer Preview offering scopes the inventory of images it provides out of the box
with a few contraints in mind.  These constrainst also apply to any images you choose to
inport into your Project.  The various constraints are enforced via the OpenShift Quota
system.  See the link:../../dev_guide/compute_resources.html[computing guide] for a description of how this system works.

Now, the specific constraints:

* A memory limit of 2GiB is in place.  The 2 GiB is spread out across the project's pods and containers.
* Up to 10 pods are allowed.
* Up to 20 Replication Controllers are allowed.
* Up to 10 Services are allowed.
* Up to 16 Secrets are allowed (though some amount of these secrets will be needed by the system's build and deployer service accounts)
* No templates that map a DockerFile VOLUME to an emptyDir Kubernetes Volume are allowed for now.  The current intent is to lift this restriction and the V3 OpenShift Online Developer Preview offering progresses out of the beta phase.
* In fact, any Dockerfile VOLUME must be mounted with a Persistent Volume Claim at this time with the V3 OpenShift Online Developer Preview offering.
* The Project associated with a user can allocate up to 2 Persistent Volume Claims.
* No images that run as ROOT are allowed.
* Only the Source-To-Image build strategy is allowed for any BuildConfigs imported into your Project.

If you want to know your Project's current resource usage, you can log into the console and view them from the settings tab of your Project view, or use the CLI command  `oc describe quota [your project's quota object's name]`.

As part of providing a set of templates out of the box, the Online Developer Preview offering has taken various, publicly accessible templates and added a memory limit template parameter with
a default setting for the deployments.  These default settings were based on tuning exercises of some common developer flows, with the 2 GiB memory limit in mind.

You can change the defaults as you see fit, based on the needs of the specific scenario you want to try.  You'll just have to keep in mind the 2 GiB overall memory limit when adjusting the settings
of your various deployments.

[NOTE]
Read about memory limits  link:../../dev_guide/compute_resources.html#memory-limits[here] and template parameters link:../../architecture/core_concepts/templates.html#parameters[here] if you require more details on those concepts.
