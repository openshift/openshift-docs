== Overview

The OpenShift Online 3 Developer Preview offering scopes the inventory of images
it provides out of the box with a few considerations in mind, which also apply
to any images you choose to import into your project. These conditions are
enforced via the OpenShift quota system; see
link:../dev_guide/compute_resources.html[Compute Resources] for information on
how this system works.

[[devpreview-current-considerations]]
== Current Considerations

* A memory limit of 2GiB is in place. The 2 GiB is spread out across the project's
pods and containers.
* Up to 10 pods are allowed.
* Up to 20 replication controllers are allowed.
* Up to 10 services are allowed.
* Up to 16 secrets are allowed (though some amount of these secrets will be needed
by the system's build and deployer service accounts).
* Any Dockerfile `VOLUME` instruction must be mounted with either a persistent
volume claim (PVC) or an EmptyDir at this time.
* The project associated with a user can allocate up to two PVCs.
* No images that run as *root* are allowed.
* Only the Source-to-Image (S2I) build strategy is allowed for any build
configurations imported into your project.

[[devpreview-checking-current-usage]]
== Checking Current Usage

To check your project's current resource usage, you can log into the web console
and view them from the *Settings* tab of your project's *Overview*, or use the
following CLI command:

----
$ oc describe quota <your_project_quota_object_name>
----

[[devpreview-default-memory-limits]]
== Default Memory Limits

As part of providing a set of templates out of the box, various publicly accessible templates
have been updated with a memory limit
template parameter with a default setting for the deployments. These default
settings were based on tuning exercises of some common developer flows, with the
2 GiB memory limit in mind.

You can change the defaults when instantiating any given template as you see fit, based on the needs of the specific
scenario you want to try. However, you must keep in mind the 2 GiB overall
memory limit when adjusting the settings of your various deployments.

See link:../dev_guide/compute_resources.html#memory-limits[Memory Limits] and
link:../architecture/core_concepts/templates.html#parameters[Templates:
Parameters] for more information on these concepts.
