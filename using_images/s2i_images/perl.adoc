== Overview
{product-title} provides
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#source-build[S2I]
enabled Perl images for building and running Perl applications.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
The https://github.com/openshift/sti-perl[Perl S2I builder image]
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The Perl S2I builder image
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
assembles your application source with any required dependencies to create a
new image containing your Perl application. This resulting image can be run
either by {product-title} or by Docker.

== Versions
Currently, {product-title} supports version
https://github.com/openshift/sti-perl/tree/master/5.16[5.16] of Perl.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry using:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/perl-516-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/perl-516-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-image-registry[image
registries], or push them into your
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#integrated-openshift-registry[{product-title}
Docker registry]. Additionally, you can create an
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[image
stream] that points to the image, either in your Docker registry or at the
external location. Your {product-title}t resources can then reference the
ImageStream. You can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example
image stream definitions] for all the provided {product-title} images.

== Configuration
The Perl image supports a number of environment variables which can be set to
control the configuration and behavior of the Perl runtime.

To set these environment variables as part of your image, you can place them into
xref:../../dev_guide/builds.adoc#environment-files[a *_.s2i/environment_* file]
inside your source code repository, or define them in
xref:../../dev_guide/builds.adoc#buildconfig-environment[the environment
section] of the build configuration's `*sourceStrategy*` definition.

You can also set environment variables to be used with an existing image when
xref:../../dev_guide/new_app.adoc#specifying-environment-variables[creating new
applications], or by
xref:../../dev_guide/environment_variables.adoc#set-environment-variables[updating
environment variables for existing objects] such as deployment configurations.

[NOTE]
====
Environment variables that control build behavior must be set as part of the s2i build
configuration or in the *_.s2i/environment_* file to make them available to the build
steps.

.Perl Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*ENABLE_CPAN_TEST*`
|When set to `true`, this variable installs all the cpan modules and runs their tests. By default,
the testing of the modules is turned off.

|`*CPAN_MIRROR*`
|This variable specifies a mirror URL which
cpanminus uses to install dependencies. By default, this URL is not specified.

|`*PERL_APACHE2_RELOAD*`
|Set this to `true` to enable automatic reloading of modified Perl modules. By
default, automatic reloading is turned off.

|`*HTTPD_START_SERVERS*`
|The https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mpm_common.html#startservers[StartServers]
directive sets the number of child server processes created on startup. Default is 8.

|`*HTTPD_MAX_REQUEST_WORKERS*`
|Number of simultaneous requests that will be handled by Apache. The default
is 256, but it will be automatically lowered if memory is limited.
|===

[[perl-accessing-logs]]

== Accessing Logs
Access logs are streamed to standard output and as such they can be viewed using
the
xref:../../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#troubleshooting-and-debugging-cli-operations[`oc
logs`] command. Error logs are stored in the *_/tmp/error_log_* file, which can
be viewed using the
xref:../../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#troubleshooting-and-debugging-cli-operations[`oc
rsh`] command to access the container.

[[perl-hot-deploy]]

== Hot Deploying
Hot deployment allows you to quickly make and deploy changes to your application
without having to generate a new S2I build. To enable hot deployment in this
image, you must set the `*PERL_APACHE2_RELOAD*` environment variable to `true`.
For example, see the xref:../../dev_guide/new_app.adoc#specifying-environment-variables[`oc new-app`]
command. You can use the xref:../../dev_guide/environment_variables.adoc#set-environment-variables[`oc env`]
command to update environment variables of existing objects.

[WARNING]
====
You should only use this option while developing or debugging; it is not
recommended to turn this on in your production environment.
====

To change your source code in a running pod, use the
xref:../../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#troubleshooting-and-debugging-cli-operations[`oc
rsh`] command to enter the container:

----
$ oc rsh <pod_id>
----

After you enter into the running container, your current directory is set to
*_/opt/app-root/src_*, where the source code is located.
