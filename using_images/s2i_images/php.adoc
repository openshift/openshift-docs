== Overview
{product-title} provides
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#source-build[S2I]
enabled PHP images for building and running PHP applications.
ifndef::openshift-enterprise[]
The https://github.com/openshift/sti-php[PHP S2I builder image]
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The PHP S2I builder image
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
assembles your application source with any required dependencies to create a
new image containing your PHP application. This resulting image can be run
either by {product-title} or by Docker.

[[php-versions]]
== Versions

Currently, {product-title} provides versions
link:https://github.com/openshift/sti-php/tree/master/5.5[5.5],
link:https://github.com/sclorg/s2i-php-container/tree/master/5.6[5.6], and
link:https://github.com/sclorg/s2i-php-container/tree/master/7.0[7.0] of PHP.

[[php-images]]
== Images

ifdef::openshift-online[]
RHEL 7 images are available through the Red Hat Registry:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/php-55-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/php-56-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/php-70-rhel7
----

You can use these images through the `php` image stream.
endif::openshift-online[]

ifndef::openshift-online[]
These images come in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Images*

The RHEL 7 images are available through the Red Hat Registry:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/php-55-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/php-56-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/php-70-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Images*

CentOS images for PHP 5.5 and 5.6 are available on Docker Hub:

----
$ docker pull openshift/php-55-centos7
$ docker pull openshift/php-56-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-image-registry[image
registries] or push them into your
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#integrated-openshift-registry[{product-title}
Docker registry]. Additionally, you can create an
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[image
stream] that points to the image, either in your Docker registry or at the
external location. Your {product-title} resources can then reference the image
stream.

You can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example
image stream definitions] for all the provided {product-title} images.

[[s2i-images-php-build-process]]
== Build Process
include::using_images/s2i_images/topics/build_process.adoc[]


[[php-configuration]]
== Configuration

The PHP image supports a number of environment variables which can be set to
control the configuration and behavior of the PHP runtime.

To set these environment variables as part of your image, you can place them into
xref:../../dev_guide/builds/build_strategies.adoc#environment-files[a *_.s2i/environment_* file]
inside your source code repository, or define them in
xref:../../dev_guide/builds/build_strategies.adoc#buildconfig-environment[the environment
section] of the build configuration's `*sourceStrategy*` definition.

You can also set environment variables to be used with an existing image when
xref:../../dev_guide/application_lifecycle/new_app.adoc#specifying-environment-variables[creating new
applications], or by
xref:../../dev_guide/environment_variables.adoc#set-environment-variables[updating
environment variables for existing objects] such as deployment configurations.

[NOTE]
====
Environment variables that control build behavior must be set as part of the s2i build
configuration or in the *_.s2i/environment_* file to make them available to the build
steps.
====

The following environment variables set their equivalent property value in the
*_php.ini_* file:

.PHP Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable Name |Description |Default

|`*ERROR_REPORTING*`
|Informs PHP of the errors, warnings, and notices for which you would like it to
take action.
|*E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE*

|`*DISPLAY_ERRORS*`
|Controls if and where PHP outputs errors, notices, and warnings.
|*ON*

|`*DISPLAY_STARTUP_ERRORS*`
|Causes any display errors that occur during PHP's startup sequence to be
handled separately from display errors.
|*OFF*

|`*TRACK_ERRORS*`
|Stores the last error/warning message in `*$php_errormsg*` (boolean).
|*OFF*

|`*HTML_ERRORS*`
|Links errors to documentation that is related to the error.
|*ON*

|`*INCLUDE_PATH*`
|Path for PHP source files.
|*_.:/opt/openshift/src:/opt/rh/php55/root/usr/share/pear_*

|`*SESSION_PATH*`
|Location for session data files.
|*_/tmp/sessions_*

|`*DOCUMENTROOT*`
|Path that defines the document root for your application (for example, *_/public_*).
|*_/_*
|===

The following environment variable sets its equivalent property value in the
*_opcache.ini_* file:

.Additional PHP settings
[cols="3a,6a,1a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable Name |Description |Default

|`*OPCACHE_MEMORY_CONSUMPTION*`
|The link:http://php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php[OPcache] shared memory
storage size.
|*16M*

|`*OPCACHE_REVALIDATE_FREQ*`
|How often to check script time stamps for updates, in seconds. *0* results in
link:http://php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php[OPcache] checking for updates on
every request.
|*2*
|===

You can also override the entire directory used to load the PHP configuration by setting:

.Additional PHP settings
[cols="3a,6a",options="header"]
|===

| Variable Name | Description

|`*PHPRC*`
|Sets the path to the *_php.ini_* file.

|`*PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR*`
|Path to scan for additional *_.ini_* configuration files
|===

You can use a custom composer repository mirror URL to download packages instead of the default 'packagist.org':

.Composer Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable Name |Description

|`*COMPOSER_MIRROR*`
|Set this variable to use a custom Composer repository mirror URL to download required packages during the build process.
Note: This only affects packages listed in *_composer.json_*.
|===

[[php-apache-configuration]]
=== Apache Configuration

If the `*DocumentRoot*` of the application is nested in the source directory
*_/opt/openshift/src_*, you can provide your own *_.htaccess_* file to override
the default Apache behavior and specify how application requests should be
handled. The *_.htaccess_* file must be located at the root of the application
source.

[[php-logging]]
== Accessing Logs

Access logs are streamed to standard out and as such they can be viewed using
the
xref:../../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#troubleshooting-and-debugging-cli-operations[`oc
logs`] command. Error logs are stored in the *_/tmp/error_log_* file, which can
be viewed using the
xref:../../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#troubleshooting-and-debugging-cli-operations[`oc
rsh`] command to access the container.

[[php-hot-deploy]]
== Hot Deploying

Hot deployment allows you to quickly make and deploy changes to your application
without having to generate a new S2I build. In order to immediately pick up
changes made in your application source code, you must run your built image with
the `*OPCACHE_REVALIDATE_FREQ=0*` environment variable.

For example, see the
xref:../../dev_guide/application_lifecycle/new_app.adoc#specifying-environment-variables[`oc new-app`]
command. You can use the
xref:../../dev_guide/environment_variables.adoc#set-environment-variables[`oc
env`] command to update environment variables of existing objects.

[WARNING]
====
You should only use this option while developing or debugging; it is not
recommended to turn this on in your production environment.
====

To change your source code in a running pod, use the
xref:../../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#troubleshooting-and-debugging-cli-operations[`oc
rsh`] command to enter the container:

----
$ oc rsh <pod_id>
----

After you enter into the running container, your current directory is set to
*_/opt/app-root/src_*, where the source code is located.

[[php-templates]]
== PHP Templates

{product-title} includes example templates to deploy a
link:https://github.com/openshift/cakephp-ex[sample CakePHP application] or a
link:https://github.com/luciddreamz/laravel-ex[sample Laravel application].
Each template builds and deploys a sample application on PHP 7.0 with a
MySQL database using a persistent volume for storage.

The sample CakePHP application can be built and deployed using the
`rhscl/php-70-rhel7` image with the following command:

----
$ oc new-app --template=cakephp-mysql-persistent
----

The sample Laravel application can be built and deployed using the
`rhscl/php-70-rhel7` image with the following command:

----
$ oc new-app --template=laravel-mysql-persistent
----
