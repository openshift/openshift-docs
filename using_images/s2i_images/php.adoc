== Overview
OpenShift provides
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#source-build[S2I]
enabled PHP images for building and running PHP applications.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
The https://github.com/openshift/sti-php[PHP S2I builder image]
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The PHP S2I builder image
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
assembles your application source with any required dependencies to create a
new image containing your PHP application. This resulting image can be run
either by OpenShift or by Docker.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift provides version
https://github.com/openshift/sti-php/tree/master/5.5[5.5] of PHP.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry via:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/php-55-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/php-55-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-image-registry[image
registries], or push them into your
xref:../../install_config/install/docker_registry.adoc#install-config-install-docker-registry[OpenShift Docker
registry]. Additionally, you can create an
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[image
stream] that points to the image, either in your Docker registry or at the
external location. Your OpenShift resources can then reference the ImageStream.
You can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example]
ImageStream definitions for all the provided OpenShift images.

== Configuration
The PHP image supports a number of environment variables which can be set to
control the configuration and behavior of the PHP runtime.

To set these environment variables, you can place them into `.sti/environment`
file inside your source code repository, or define them in the environment
section of the BuildConfig Source Strategy definition.

The following environment variables set their equivalent property value in the
php.ini file:

.PHP Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description |Default

|`*ERROR_REPORTING*`
|Informs PHP of the errors, warnings, and notices for which you would like it to take action.
|E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE

|`*DISPLAY_ERRORS*`
|Controls if and where PHP outputs errors, notices, and warnings.
|ON

|`*DISPLAY_STARTUP_ERRORS*`
|Causes any display errors that occur during PHP's startup sequence to be
handled separately from display errors.
|OFF

|`*TRACK_ERRORS*`
|Stores the last error/warning message in `*$php_errormsg*` (boolean).
|OFF

|`*HTML_ERRORS*`
|Links errors to documentation that is related to the error.
|ON

|`*INCLUDE_PATH*`
|Path for PHP source files.
|.:/opt/openshift/src:/opt/rh/php55/root/usr/share/pear

|`*SESSION_PATH*`
|Location for session data files.
|/tmp/sessions
|===

The following environment variable sets its equivalent property value in the opcache.ini file:

.Additional PHP settings
[cols="3a,6a,1a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description |Default

|`*OPCACHE_MEMORY_CONSUMPTION*`
|The OPcache shared memory storage size.
|16M
|===

You can also override the entire directory used to load the PHP configuration by setting:

.Additional PHP settings
[cols="3a,6a",options="header"]
|===

| Variable name | Description

|`*PHPRC*`
|Sets the path to the php.ini file.

|`*PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR*`
|Path to scan for additional ini configuration files
|===

=== Apache Configuration
If the `*DocumentRoot*` of the application is nested in the source directory
*_/opt/openshift/src_*, you can provide your own *_.htaccess_* file to override
the default Apache behavior and specify how application requests should be
handled. The *_.htaccess_* file must be located at the root of the application
source.

== Logs
This image logs primarily to standard out and as such the logs can be viewed via the xref:../../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#troubleshooting-and-debugging-cli-operations[oc logs] command.  Access logs are stored in *_/tmp/access_log_* which can be viewed using xref:../../dev_guide/executing_remote_commands.adoc#dev-guide-executing-remote-commands[oc exec] to access the container.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
== Hot Deploy
Hot deploy works in this image out of the box.

To change your source code in running container, use Docker's link:https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/exec/[exec] command:

	$ docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> /bin/bash

After you link:https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/exec/[docker exec] into the running container, your current directory is set to `/opt/app-root/src`, where the source code is located.
