== Overview

S2I builder images normally include
xref:../../creating_images/s2i.adoc#s2i-scripts[*_assemble_* and *_run_* scripts],
but the default behavior of those scripts may not be suitable for all users.
This topic covers a few approaches for customizing the behavior of an
S2I builder that includes default scripts.

== Invoking Scripts Embedded in an Image

Typically, builder images provide their own version of the S2I scripts that
cover the most common use-cases. If these scripts do not fulfill your needs, S2I
provides a way of overriding them by adding custom ones in the *_.s2i/bin_*
directory. However, by doing this you are
xref:../../creating_images/s2i.adoc#s2i-scripts[completely replacing the
standard scripts]. In some cases this is acceptable, but in other scenarios you
may prefer to execute a few commands before (or after) the scripts while
retaining the logic of the script provided in the image. In this case, it is
possible to create a wrapper script that executes custom logic and delegates
further work to the default script in the image.

To determine the location of the scripts inside of the builder image, look at
at the value of `*io.openshift.s2i.scripts-url*` label. Use `docker inspect`:

----
$ docker inspect --format='{{ index .Config.Labels "io.openshift.s2i.scripts-url" }}' openshift/wildfly-100-centos7
image:///usr/libexec/s2i
----

You inspected the *openshift/wildfly-100-centos7* builder image and
found out that the scripts are in the *_/usr/libexec/s2i_* directory.

With this knowledge, invoke any of these scripts from your own by wrapping its
invocation.

.*_.s2i/bin/assemble_* script
====
----
#!/bin/bash
echo "Before assembling"

/usr/libexec/s2i/assemble
rc=$?

if [ $rc -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "After successful assembling"
else
    echo "After failed assembling"
fi

exit $rc
----
====

The example shows a custom *_assemble_* script that prints the message,
executes standard *_assemble_* script from the image and prints another message
depending on the exit code of the *_assemble_* script.

Wrapping the *_run_* script is a bit tricky because we have to use `exec` for
invoking it (see chapter
xref:../../creating_images/guidelines.adoc#general-docker-guidelines[Use `exec` in
Wrapper Scripts]). As a consequence, it is impossible to have a post-run step
because the code after `exec /usr/libexec/s2i/run` never gets executed.

.*_.s2i/bin/run_* script
====
----
#!/bin/bash
echo "Before running application"
exec /usr/libexec/s2i/run
----
====
