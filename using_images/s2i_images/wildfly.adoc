== Overview
{product-title} provides
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#source-build[S2I]
enabled Wildfly images for building and running Java applications.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
The https://github.com/openshift-s2i/s2i-wildfly[Wildfly S2I builder image]
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The Wildfly S2I builder image
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
assembles your application source with any required dependencies to create a
new image containing your Java application. This resulting image can be run
either by {product-title} or by Docker.

== Versions
Currently, {product-title} supports version
https://github.com/openshift-s2i/s2i-wildfly/tree/master/12.0[12.0], 
https://github.com/openshift-s2i/s2i-wildfly/tree/master/11.0[11.0], 
https://github.com/openshift-s2i/s2i-wildfly/tree/master/10.1[10.1], and
https://github.com/openshift-s2i/s2i-wildfly/tree/master/10.0[10.0] of Wildfly.

== Images

These images are available on DockerHub. To download them:

----
$ docker pull openshift/wildfly-120-centos7
$ docker pull openshift/wildfly-110-centos7
$ docker pull openshift/wildfly-101-centos7
$ docker pull openshift/wildfly-100-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from DockerHub or push them into your
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#integrated-openshift-registry[{product-title}
Docker registry]. Additionally, you can create an
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[image
stream] that points to the image, either in your Docker registry or at the
external location. Your {product-title} resources can then reference the
ImageStream. You can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example
image stream definitions] for all the provided {product-title} images.

== Build Process
include::using_images/s2i_images/topics/build_process.adoc[]

== Configuration
The Wildfly image supports a number of environment variables which can be set to
control the configuration and behavior of the Wildfly application server.

To set these environment variables as part of your image, you can place them into
xref:../../dev_guide/builds/build_strategies.adoc#environment-files[a *_.s2i/environment_* file]
inside your source code repository, or define them in
xref:../../dev_guide/builds/build_strategies.adoc#buildconfig-environment[the environment
section] of the build configuration's `*sourceStrategy*` definition.

You can also set environment variables to be used with an existing image when
xref:../../dev_guide/application_lifecycle/new_app.adoc#specifying-environment-variables[creating new
applications], or by
xref:../../dev_guide/environment_variables.adoc#set-environment-variables[updating
environment variables for existing objects] such as deployment configurations.

[NOTE]
====
Environment variables that control build behavior must be set as part of the s2i build
configuration or in the *_.s2i/environment_* file to make them available to the build
steps.

.Wildfly Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*MAVEN_ARGS*`
|Overrides the default arguments passed to Maven during the build process.

|`*MAVEN_ARGS_APPEND*`
|This value will be appended to either the default Maven arguments, or the value of `MAVEN_ARGS` if
`MAVEN_ARGS` is set.

|`*MAVEN_OPTS*`
|Contains JVM parameters to Maven.  Will be appended to JVM arguments that are calculated by the image
itself (e.g. heap size), so values provided here will take precedence.

|`*JAVA_GC_OPTS*`
|When set to a non-null value, this value will be passed to the JVM instead of the default garbage collection tuning
values defined by the image.

|`*CONTAINER_CORE_LIMIT*`
|When set to a non-null value, the number of parallel garbage collection threads will be set to this value.

|`*USE_JAVA_DIAGNOSTICS*`
|When set to a non-null value, various JVM related diagnostics will be turned on such as verbose garbage
collection tracing.

|`*CONTAINER_CORE_LIMIT*`
|When set to a non-null value, the number of parallel garbage collection threads will be set to this value.

|`*AUTO_DEPLOY_EXPLODED*`
|When set to `true`, Wildfly will automatically deploy exploded war content.  When unset or set to `false`,
a `.dodeploy` file must be touched to trigger deployment of exploded war content.

|`*MYSQL_DATABASE*`
|If set, WildFly will attempt to define a MySQL datasource based on the assumption you have an OpenShift service named `mysql` defined.
It will attempt to reference the following environment variables which are automatically defined if the `mysql` service exists:
`MYSQL_SERVICE_PORT`, `MYSQL_SERVICE_HOST`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, and `MYSQL_USER`.

|`*POSTGRESQL_DATABASE*`
|If set, WildFly will attempt to define a PostgreSQL datasource based on the assumption you have an OpenShift service named `postgresql` defined.
It will attempt to reference the following environment variables which are automatically defined if the `postgresql` service exists:
`POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_PORT`, `POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_HOST`, `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD`, and `POSTGRESQL_USER`.
|===

== Accessing Logs
Access logs are streamed to standard output and as such they can be viewed using
the
xref:../../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#troubleshooting-and-debugging-cli-operations[`oc
logs`] command. Error logs are stored in the *_/tmp/error_log_* file, which can
be viewed using the
xref:../../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#troubleshooting-and-debugging-cli-operations[`oc
rsh`] command to access the container.

== Hot Deploying
Hot deployment allows you to quickly make and deploy changes to your application
without having to generate a new S2I build. Hot deployment for war files is already
enabled, but to enable hot deployment of exploded war content, you must set the
`*AUTO_DEPLOY_EXPLODED*` environment variable to `true`.  For example, see the
xref:../../dev_guide/application_lifecycle/new_app.adoc#specifying-environment-variables[`oc new-app`]
command. You can use the xref:../../dev_guide/environment_variables.adoc#set-environment-variables[`oc set env`]
command to update environment variables of existing objects.

Deployed content is stored under `*/wildfly/standalone/deployments*`.

[WARNING]
====
You should only use this option while developing or debugging; it is not
recommended to turn this on in your production environment.
