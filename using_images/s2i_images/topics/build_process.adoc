S2I produces ready-to-run images by injecting source code into a container and
letting the container prepare that source code for execution. It performs the
following steps:

. Starts a container from the builder image.
. Downloads the application source.
. Streams the scripts and application sources into the builder image container.
. Runs the _assemble_ script (from the builder image).
. Saves the final image.

See xref:../../creating_images/s2i.adoc#build-process[S2I Build Process] for a detailed overview of the build process.
