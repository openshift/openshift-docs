== Overview
OpenShift provides
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[S2I]
enabled Python images for building and running Python applications.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
The https://github.com/openshift/sti-python[Python S2I builder image]
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The Python S2I builder image
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
assembles your application source with any required dependencies to create a
new image containing your Python application. This resulting image can be run
either by OpenShift or by Docker.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift provides version https://github.com/openshift/sti-python/tree/master/3.3[3.3] of Python.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry using:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/python-33-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/python-33-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.html[image
registries], or push them into your
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.html#integrated-openshift-registry[OpenShift Docker
registry]. Additionally, you can create an
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#image-streams[image
stream] that points to the image, either in your Docker registry or at the
external location. Your OpenShift resources can then reference the ImageStream.
You can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example
image stream definitions] for all the provided OpenShift images.

== Configuration
The Python image supports a number of environment variables which can be set to
control the configuration and behavior of the Python runtime.

To set these environment variables, you can place them into
link:../../dev_guide/builds.html#environment-files[a *_.sti/environment_* file]
inside your source code repository, or define them in
link:../../dev_guide/builds.html#buildconfig-environment[the environment
section] of the build configuration's `*sourceStrategy*` definition.

.Python Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*APP_FILE*`
|This variable specifies the file name passed to the
python interpreter which is responsible for launching the application. This variable is set to *_app.py_* by default.

|`*APP_MODULE*`
|This variable specifies the WSGI callable. It follows the pattern
`$(MODULE_NAME):$(VARIABLE_NAME)`, where the module name is a full dotted path and
the variable name refers to a function inside the specified module. If you use
`setup.py` for installing the application, then the module name can be read from
that file and the variable defaults to `application`. There is an example
https://github.com/openshift/sti-python/tree/master/3.3/test/setup-test-app[setup-test-app]
available.

|`*APP_CONFIG*`
|This variable indicates the path to a valid Python file with a
http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/configure.html[gunicorn configuration].


|`*DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC*`
| Set it to a nonempty value to inhibit the execution of `manage.py collectstatic`
during the build. Only affects Django projects.

|`*DISABLE_MIGRATE*`
| Set it to a nonempty value to inhibit the execution of `manage.py migrate`
when the produced image is run. Only affects Django projects.

[[python-hot-deploy]]

== Hot Deploying
Hot deployment allows you to quickly make and deploy changes to your application
without having to generate a new S2I build. If you are using Django, hot
deployment works out of the box.

To enable hot deployment while using Gunicorn, ensure you have a Gunicorn
configuration file inside your repository with
https://gunicorn-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/settings.html#reload[the
`*reload*` option] set to *true*. Specify your configuration file using the
`*APP_CONFIG*` environment variable. For example, see the
link:../../dev_guide/new_app.html#specifying-environment-variables[`oc new-app`]
command. You can use the
link:../../dev_guide/environment_variables.html#set-environment-variables[`oc env`]
command to update environment variables of existing objects.

[WARNING]
====
You should only use this option while developing or debugging; it is not
recommended to turn this on in your production environment.
====

To change your source code in a running pod, use the
link:../../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html#troubleshooting-and-debugging-cli-operations[`oc rsh`]
command to enter the container:

----
$ oc rsh <pod_id>
----

After you enter into the running container, your current directory is set to
*_/opt/app-root/src_*, where the source code is located.
