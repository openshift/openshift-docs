== Overview
{product-title} provides
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#source-build[S2I]
enabled Python images for building and running Python applications.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
The https://github.com/openshift/sti-python[Python S2I builder image]
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The Python S2I builder image
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
assembles your application source with any required dependencies to create a
new image containing your Python application. This resulting image can be run
either by {product-title} or by Docker.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift provides versions https://github.com/openshift/sti-python/tree/master/3.3[3.3] and https://github.com/openshift/sti-python/tree/master/3.5[3.5] of Python.

== Images

These images come in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 images are available through Red Hat's subscription registry using:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/python-33-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/python-35-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

These images are available on DockerHub. To download them:

----
$ docker pull openshift/python-33-centos7
$ docker pull centos/python-35-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-image-registry[image
registries], or push them into your
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#integrated-openshift-registry[{product-title}
Docker registry]. Additionally, you can create an
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[image
stream] that points to the image, either in your Docker registry or at the
external location. Your {product-title} resources can then reference the
ImageStream. You can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example
image stream definitions] for all the provided {product-title} images.

== Configuration
The Python image supports a number of environment variables which can be set to
control the configuration and behavior of the Python runtime.

To set these environment variables as part of your image, you can place them into
xref:../../dev_guide/builds.adoc#environment-files[a *_.s2i/environment_* file]
inside your source code repository, or define them in
xref:../../dev_guide/builds.adoc#buildconfig-environment[the environment
section] of the build configuration's `*sourceStrategy*` definition.

You can also set environment variables to be used with an existing image when
xref:../../dev_guide/new_app.adoc#specifying-environment-variables[creating new
applications], or by
xref:../../dev_guide/environment_variables.adoc#set-environment-variables[updating
environment variables for existing objects] such as deployment configurations.

[NOTE]
====
Environment variables that control build behavior must be set as part of the s2i build
configuration or in the *_.s2i/environment_* file to make them available to the build
steps.

.Python Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*APP_FILE*`
|This variable specifies the file name passed to the
python interpreter which is responsible for launching the application. This variable is set to *_app.py_* by default.

|`*APP_MODULE*`
|This variable specifies the WSGI callable. It follows the pattern
`$(MODULE_NAME):$(VARIABLE_NAME)`, where the module name is a full dotted path and
the variable name refers to a function inside the specified module. If you use
`setup.py` for installing the application, then the module name can be read from
that file and the variable defaults to `application`. There is an example
https://github.com/openshift/sti-python/tree/master/3.3/test/setup-test-app[setup-test-app]
available.

|`*APP_CONFIG*`
|This variable indicates the path to a valid Python file with a
http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/configure.html[gunicorn configuration].


|`*DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC*`
| Set it to a nonempty value to inhibit the execution of `manage.py collectstatic`
during the build. Only affects Django projects.

|`*DISABLE_MIGRATE*`
| Set it to a nonempty value to inhibit the execution of `manage.py migrate`
when the produced image is run. Only affects Django projects.

|`*PIP_INDEX_URL*`
| Set this variable to use a custom index URL or mirror to download required packages
during build process. This only affects packages listed in requirements.txt.

| `*WEB_CONCURRENCY*`
| Set this to change the default setting for the number of
http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#workers[workers]. By default,
this is set to the number of available cores times 4.

[[python-hot-deploy]]

== Hot Deploying
Hot deployment allows you to quickly make and deploy changes to your application
without having to generate a new S2I build. If you are using Django, hot
deployment works out of the box.

To enable hot deployment while using Gunicorn, ensure you have a Gunicorn
configuration file inside your repository with
https://gunicorn-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/settings.html#reload[the
`*reload*` option] set to *true*. Specify your configuration file using the
`*APP_CONFIG*` environment variable. For example, see the
xref:../../dev_guide/new_app.adoc#specifying-environment-variables[`oc new-app`]
command. You can use the
xref:../../dev_guide/environment_variables.adoc#set-environment-variables[`oc env`]
command to update environment variables of existing objects.

[WARNING]
====
You should only use this option while developing or debugging; it is not
recommended to turn this on in your production environment.
====

To change your source code in a running pod, use the
xref:../../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#troubleshooting-and-debugging-cli-operations[`oc rsh`]
command to enter the container:

----
$ oc rsh <pod_id>
----

After you enter into the running container, your current directory is set to
*_/opt/app-root/src_*, where the source code is located.
