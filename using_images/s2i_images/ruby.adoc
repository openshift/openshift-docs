== Overview
{product-title} provides
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#source-build[S2I]
enabled Ruby images for building and running Ruby applications.
ifndef::openshift-enterprise[]
The https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby[Ruby S2I builder image]
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The Ruby S2I builder image
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
assembles your application source with any required dependencies to create a
new image containing your Ruby application. This resulting image can be run either by {product-title} or by Docker.

[[s2i-images-ruby-versions]]
== Versions
Currently, {product-title} provides versions
link:https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby/tree/master/2.0[2.0],
link:https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby/tree/master/2.2[2.2], and
link:https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby/tree/master/2.3[2.3] of Ruby.

[[s2i-images-ruby-images]]
== Images

ifdef::openshift-online[]
RHEL 7 images are available through the Red Hat registry:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ruby-20-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/ruby-22-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/ruby-23-rhel7
----

You can use these images through the `ruby` image stream.
endif::openshift-online[]

ifndef::openshift-online[]
These images come in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Images*

The RHEL 7 images are available through the Red Hat registry:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ruby-20-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/ruby-22-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/ruby-23-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Images*

These images are available on Docker Hub:

----
$ docker pull openshift/ruby-20-centos7
$ docker pull openshift/ruby-22-centos7
$ docker pull centos/ruby-23-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-image-registry[image
registries] or push them into your
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#integrated-openshift-registry[{product-title}
Docker registry]. Additionally, you can create an
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[image
stream] that points to the image, either in your Docker registry or at the
external location. Your {product-title} resources can then reference the
ImageStream. You can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example
image stream definitions] for all the provided {product-title} images.
endif::openshift-online[]

[[s2i-images-ruby-config]]
== Configuration
The Ruby image supports a number of environment variables which can be set to
control the configuration and behavior of the Ruby runtime.

To set these environment variables as part of your image, you can place them into
xref:../../dev_guide/builds.adoc#environment-files[a *_.s2i/environment_* file]
inside your source code repository, or define them in
xref:../../dev_guide/builds.adoc#buildconfig-environment[the environment
section] of the build configuration's `*sourceStrategy*` definition.

You can also set environment variables to be used with an existing image when
xref:../../dev_guide/new_app.adoc#specifying-environment-variables[creating new
applications], or by
xref:../../dev_guide/environment_variables.adoc#set-environment-variables[updating
environment variables for existing objects] such as deployment configurations.

[NOTE]
====
Environment variables that control build behavior must be set as part of the s2i build
configuration or in the *_.s2i/environment_* file to make them available to the build
steps.

.Ruby Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*RACK_ENV*`
|This variable specifies the environment within which the Ruby application is
deployed; for example, `production`, `development`, or `test`. Each level has
different behavior in terms of logging verbosity, error pages, and ruby gem
installation. The application assets are only compiled if `*RACK_ENV*` is set to
`production`; the default value is `production`.

|`*RAILS_ENV*`
|This variable specifies the environment within which the Ruby on Rails
application is deployed; for example, `production`, `development`, or `test`.
Each level has different behavior in terms of logging verbosity, error pages,
and ruby gem installation. The application assets are only compiled if
`*RAILS_ENV*` is set to `production`. This variable is set to `${RACK_ENV}` by default.

|`*DISABLE_ASSET_COMPILATION*`
|When set to `true`, this variable disables the process of asset compilation.
Asset compilation only happens when the application runs in a production
environment. Therefore, you can use this variable when assets have already been
compiled.

|`*PUMA_MIN_THREADS*`, `*PUMA_MAX_THREADS*`
|This variable indicates the minimum and maximum number of threads that will be
available in link:https://github.com/puma/puma[Puma]'s thread pool.

|`*PUMA_WORKERS*`
|This variable indicates the number of worker processes to be launched in Puma's
link:https://github.com/puma/puma#clustered-mode[clustered mode] (when Puma runs
more than two processes). If not explicitly set, the default behavior sets
`*PUMA_WORKERS*` to a value that is appropriate for the memory available to the
container and the number of cores on the host.

|`*RUBYGEM_MIRROR*`
|Set this variable to use a custom RubyGems mirror URL to download required gem
packages during the build process.
Note: This environment variable is only available for Ruby 2.2+ images.

[[ruby-hot-deploy]]

== Hot Deploying
Hot deployment allows you to quickly make and deploy changes to your application
without having to generate a new S2I build. The method for enabling hot
deployment in this image differs based on the application type.

*Ruby on Rails Applications*

For Ruby on Rails application, run the built Rails application with the
`*RAILS_ENV=development*` environment variable passed to the running pod. For an
existing deployment configuration, you can use
xref:../../dev_guide/environment_variables.adoc#set-environment-variables[the
`oc set env`] command:

----
$ oc set env dc/rails-app RAILS_ENV=development
----

*Other Types of Ruby Applications (Sinatra, Padrino, etc.)*

For other types of Ruby applications, your application must be built with a gem
that can reload the server every time a change to the source code is made inside
the running container. Those gems are:

* link:https://github.com/rtomayko/shotgun[Shotgun]
* link:https://github.com/alexch/rerun[Rerun]
* link:https://github.com/johnbintz/rack-livereload[Rack-livereload]

In order to be able to run your application in development mode, you must modify
the xref:../../creating_images/s2i.adoc#s2i-scripts[S2I *_run_* script] so that
the web server is launched by the chosen gem, which checks for changes in the
source code.

After you build your application image with your version of the
xref:../../creating_images/s2i.adoc#s2i-scripts[S2I *_run_* script], run the
image with the `*RACK_ENV=development*` environment variable. For example, see the
xref:../../dev_guide/new_app.adoc#specifying-environment-variables[`oc new-app`]
command. You can use the
xref:../../dev_guide/environment_variables.adoc#set-environment-variables[`oc set env`]
command to update environment variables of existing objects.

[WARNING]
====
You should only use this option while developing or debugging; it is not
recommended to turn this on in your production environment.
====

To change your source code in a running pod, use the
xref:../../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#troubleshooting-and-debugging-cli-operations[`oc rsh`]
command to enter the container:

----
$ oc rsh <pod_id>
----

After you enter into the running container, your current directory is set to
*_/opt/app-root/src_*, where the source code is located.

[[ruby-templates]]
== Ruby Templates

{product-title} includes an example template to deploy a
link:https://github.com/openshift/rails-ex[sample Rails application].
This template builds and deploys the sample application on Ruby 2.3 with a
PostgreSQL database using a persistent volume for storage.

The sample application can be built and deployed using the `rhscl/ruby-23-rhel7`
image with the following command:

----
$ oc new-app --template=rails-pgsql-persistent
----
