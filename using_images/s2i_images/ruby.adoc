== Overview
OpenShift provides
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[S2I]
enabled Ruby images for building and running Ruby applications.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
The https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby[Ruby S2I builder image]
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The Ruby S2I builder image
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
assembles your application source with any required dependencies to create a
new image containing your Ruby application. This resulting image can be run either by OpenShift or by Docker.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift provides version
https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby/tree/master/2.0[2.0] of Ruby.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry via:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ruby-20-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/ruby-20-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.html[image
registries], or push them into your
link:../../install_config/install/docker_registry.html[OpenShift Docker
registry]. Additionally, you can create an
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#image-streams[image
stream] that points to the image, either in your Docker registry or at the
external location. Your OpenShift resources can then reference the ImageStream.
You can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example]
ImageStream definitions for all the provided OpenShift images.

== Configuration
The Ruby image supports a number of environment variables which can be set to
control the configuration and behavior of the Ruby runtime.

To set these environment variables, you can place them into a
link:../../dev_guide/builds.html#environment-files[`.sti/environment`] file
inside your source code repository, or define them in the
link:../../dev_guide/builds.html#buildconfig-environment[environment section]
of the BuildConfig Source Strategy definition.

.Ruby Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*RACK_ENV*`
|This variable specifies the environment within which the Ruby application is
deployed; for example, `production`, `development`, or `test`. Each level has
different behavior in terms of logging verbosity, error pages, and ruby gem
installation. The application assets are only compiled if `*RACK_ENV*` is set to
`production`; the default value is `production`.

|`*RAILS_ENV*`
|This variable specifies the environment within which the Ruby on Rails
application is deployed; for example, `production`, `development`, or `test`.
Each level has different behavior in terms of logging verbosity, error pages,
and ruby gem installation. The application assets are only compiled if
`*RAILS_ENV*` is set to `production`. This variable is set to `${RACK_ENV}` by default.

|`*DISABLE_ASSET_COMPILATION*`
|The presence of this variable disables the process of asset compilation.
Asset compilation only happens when the application runs in a production
environment. Therefore, you can use this variable when assets have already been
compiled.

== Hot Deploy
In order to dynamically pick up changes made in your application source code, you need to make following steps:

*For Ruby on Rails applications*

Run the built Rails image with the `RAILS_ENV=development` environment variable passed to the link:http://docker.io[Docker] `-e` run flag:

	$ docker run -e RAILS_ENV=development -p 8080:8080 rails-app

*For other types of Ruby applications (Sinatra, Padrino, etc.)*

Your application needs to be built with one of gems that reloads the server every time changes in source code are done inside the running container. Those gems are:

* link:https://github.com/rtomayko/shotgun[Shotgun]
* link:https://github.com/alexch/rerun[Rerun]
* link:https://github.com/johnbintz/rack-livereload[Rack-livereload]

Please note that in order to be able to run your application in development mode, you need to modify the link:https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image#anatomy-of-a-builder-image[S2I run script], so the web server is launched by the chosen gem, which checks for changes in the source code.

After you built your application image with your version of link:#s2i-scripts[S2I run script], run the image with the RACK_ENV=development environment variable passed to the link:http://docker.io[Docker] -e run flag:

	$ docker run -e RACK_ENV=development -p 8080:8080 sinatra-app

To change your source code in running container, use Docker's link:https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/exec/[exec] command:

	$ docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> /bin/bash

After you link:https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/exec/[docker exec] into the running container, your current directory is set to `/opt/app-root/src`, where the source code is located.
