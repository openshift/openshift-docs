== Overview
OpenShift provides
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[S2I]
enabled Ruby images for building and running Ruby applications.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
The https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby[Ruby S2I builder image]
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The Ruby S2I builder image
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
assembles your application source with any required dependencies to create a
new image containing your Ruby application. This resulting image can be run either by OpenShift or by Docker.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift provides version
https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby/tree/master/2.0[2.0] of Ruby.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry using:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ruby-20-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/ruby-20-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.html[image
registries], or push them into your
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.html#integrated-openshift-registry[OpenShift Docker
registry]. Additionally, you can create an
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#image-streams[image
stream] that points to the image, either in your Docker registry or at the
external location. Your OpenShift resources can then reference the ImageStream.
You can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example
image stream definitions] for all the provided OpenShift images.

== Configuration
The Ruby image supports a number of environment variables which can be set to
control the configuration and behavior of the Ruby runtime.

To set these environment variables, you can place them into
link:../../dev_guide/builds.html#environment-files[a *_.sti/environment_* file]
inside your source code repository, or define them in
link:../../dev_guide/builds.html#buildconfig-environment[the environment
section] of the build configuration's `*sourceStrategy*` definition.

.Ruby Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*RACK_ENV*`
|This variable specifies the environment within which the Ruby application is
deployed; for example, `production`, `development`, or `test`. Each level has
different behavior in terms of logging verbosity, error pages, and ruby gem
installation. The application assets are only compiled if `*RACK_ENV*` is set to
`production`; the default value is `production`.

|`*RAILS_ENV*`
|This variable specifies the environment within which the Ruby on Rails
application is deployed; for example, `production`, `development`, or `test`.
Each level has different behavior in terms of logging verbosity, error pages,
and ruby gem installation. The application assets are only compiled if
`*RAILS_ENV*` is set to `production`. This variable is set to `${RACK_ENV}` by default.

|`*DISABLE_ASSET_COMPILATION*`
|This variable set to `true` disables the process of asset compilation.
Asset compilation only happens when the application runs in a production
environment. Therefore, you can use this variable when assets have already been
compiled.

[[ruby-hot-deploy]]

== Hot Deploying
Hot deployment allows you to quickly make and deploy changes to your application
without having to generate a new S2I build. The method for enabling hot
deployment in this image differs based on the application type.

*Ruby on Rails Applications*

For Ruby on Rails application, run the built Rails application with the
`*RAILS_ENV=development*` environment variable passed to the running pod. For an
existing deployment configuration, you can use
link:../../dev_guide/environment_variables.html#set-environment-variables[the
`oc env`] command:

----
$ oc env dc/rails-app RAILS_ENV=development
----

*Other Types of Ruby Applications (Sinatra, Padrino, etc.)*

For other types of Ruby applications, your application must be built with a gem
that can reload the server every time a change to the source code is made inside
the running container. Those gems are:

* link:https://github.com/rtomayko/shotgun[Shotgun]
* link:https://github.com/alexch/rerun[Rerun]
* link:https://github.com/johnbintz/rack-livereload[Rack-livereload]

In order to be able to run your application in development mode, you must modify
the link:../../creating_images/s2i.html#s2i-scripts[S2I *_run_* script] so that
the web server is launched by the chosen gem, which checks for changes in the
source code.

After you build your application image with your version of the
link:../../creating_images/s2i.html#s2i-scripts[S2I *_run_* script], run the
image with the `*RACK_ENV=development*` environment variable. For example, see the
link:../../dev_guide/new_app.html#specifying-environment-variables[`oc new-app`]
command. You can use the
link:../../dev_guide/environment_variables.html#set-environment-variables[`oc env`]
command to update environment variables of existing objects.

[WARNING]
====
You should only use this option while developing or debugging; it is not
recommended to turn this on in your production environment.
====

To change your source code in a running pod, use the
link:../../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html#troubleshooting-and-debugging-cli-operations[`oc rsh`]
command to enter the container:

----
$ oc rsh <pod_id>
----

After you enter into the running container, your current directory is set to
*_/opt/app-root/src_*, where the source code is located.
