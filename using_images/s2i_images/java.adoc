== Overview
OpenShift provides
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[S2I]
enabled Java images for building and running Java applications.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
The https://github.com/fabric8io/java-main/tree/master/[Java S2I builder image]
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The Java S2I builder image
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
assembles your application source with any required dependencies to create a new
image containing your Java application. This resulting image can be run either
by OpenShift or by Docker. This image is intended for use with
https://maven.apache.org[Maven]-based Java standalone projects (that are run via
main class).

== Versions
The current version supports JDK 1.7 and Maven 3.2.x projects.

== Images

To use this image, you can either access it directly from those
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.html[image
registries], or push it into your
link:../../install_config/install/docker_registry.html[OpenShift Docker registry].
Additionally, you can create an
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#image-streams[image
stream] that points to the image, either in your Docker registry or at the
external location. Your OpenShift resources can then reference the ImageStream.
You can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example]
ImageStream definitions for all the provided OpenShift images.

== Configuration

By default, the Java S2I builder image uses Maven to build the project with the
following goals and options:

----
$ mvn package dependency:copy-dependencies -Popenshift -DskipTests -e
----

Based on these defaults, the image compiles the project and copies all the
transitive dependencies into the output directory without running tests.
Additionally, if the project has a profile named `*openshift*`, then it is
activated for the build.

You can override these default goals and options by specifying the following environment variables:

.Java Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description |Example

|`*MAVEN_ARGS*`
|The arguments that are passed to the mvn command.
|To package and also run tests:
----
sti build -e "MAVEN_ARGS=clean test package" <git_repo_URL> fabric8/java-main <target_image_name>
----

|`*JAVA_MAIN*`
|Specifies the main class of the project. This can also be accomplished from within the *_.sti/environment_* file as a Maven property inside the project (*docker.env.Main*).

=== Working with Multi-module Projects

If a Java project consists of multiple Maven modules, it can be useful to
explicitly specify the output directory, or which modules to build.

To specify which modules to build in a multi-module project, along with all
their module dependencies:

----
sti build -e "MAVEN_ARGS=install -pl <my.groupId>:<my.artifactId> -am" <git_repo_URL> fabric8/java-main <target_image_name>
----

Specifying the directory where the Maven project outputs the artifacts helps the
S2I build to pick them up. If unspecified, the default is the
*_sources/target/_* directory.

To specify the output directory and which modules to build in a multi-module
project:

----
sti build -e "OUTPUT_DIR=<path/to/myartifact/target>,MAVEN_ARGS=install -pl <my.groupId>:<my.artifactId> -am" <git_repo_URL> fabric8/java-main <target_image_name>
----
