[[s2i-images-java-overview]]
== Overview

{product-title} provides
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#source-build[S2I builder images] for building Java applications. These builder images take your application source or binary artifacts, build the source using Maven, if the source was provided, and assemble the artifacts with any required dependencies to create a new, ready-to-run image containing your Java application. This resulting image can be run on {product-title} or run directly with Docker.

The builder images are intended for use with
link:https://maven.apache.org[Maven]-based Java standalone projects that are run
via main class.


[[s2i-images-java-versions]]
== Versions

The current version of the Java S2I builder images support OpenJDK 1.8 and 11,
Jolokia 1.6.2, and Maven 3.6.


[[s2i-images-java-images]]
== Images

The RHEL 7 and RHEL 8 images are available through the Red Hat Registry.

You can use these images through the following image streams:

* `redhat-openjdk18-openshift` (RHEL 7, JDK 8)
* `ubi8-openjdk-11` (RHEL UBI 8, JDK 11)
* `ubi8-openjdk-8` (RHEL UBI 8, JDK 8)
* `openjdk-11-rhel7` (RHEL 7, JDK 11)
* `java` (Catch-all image stream that incorporates all of the other image streams, and unless otherwise specified, via a tag, defaults to RHEL 8/JDK 11.)

ifndef::openshift-online[]
To use these images on {product-title}, you can either access them directly from
the Red Hat Registry or push them into your
xref:../../install_config/registry/index.adoc#install-config-registry-overview[{product-title} container image registry]. Additionally, you can create an
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[image stream] that points to the image, either in your container image registry or at the external location. Your {product-title} resources can then reference the
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-container-images/openjdk/release/templates/image-streams.json[image stream definition].

[[s2i-images-java-build-process]]
== Build Process
include::using_images/s2i_images/topics/build_process.adoc[]

[[s2i-images-java-configuration]]
== Configuration

By default, the Java S2I builder image uses Maven to build the project with the
following goals and options:

----
mvn -e -Popenshift -DskipTests -Dcom.redhat.xpaas.repo.redhatga -Dfabric8.skip=true --batch-mode -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -s /tmp/artifacts/configuration/settings.xml -Dmaven.repo.local=/tmp/artifacts/m2  package
----

Based on these defaults, the builder image compiles the project and copies all
the transitive dependencies into the output directory without running tests.
Additionally, if the project has a profile named `openshift`, it is
activated for the build.

You can override these default goals and options by specifying the following environment variables:

|===
|Variable name |Description

|`MAVEN_S2I_ARTIFACT_DIRS`
|Relative paths of source directories to scan for build output, which are copied to `DEPLOY_DIR`. Defaults to `target`.

|`JAVA_MAIN_CLASS`
|A main class to use as the argument for `java`. When this environment variable is given, all jar files in `JAVA_APP_DIR` are added to the classpath and `JAVA_LIB_DIR`.

|`MAVEN_ARGS`
|The arguments that are passed to the `mvn` command. Defining this variable replaces the defaults, which are `-e -Popenshift -DskipTests -Dcom.redhat.xpaas.repo.redhatga package`.

|`MAVEN_ARGS_APPEND`
|Additional Maven arguments.

|===

This is a selection of the environment variables available for configuring the behavior of the OpenJDK containers. For a comprehensive list, see <<s2i-images-java-environment-variables>>.

[[s2i-images-java-deploy-applications]]
== Building and Deploying Java Applications

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
The
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-container-images/openjdk/release/templates/image-streams.json[OpenJDK image stream] must first be installed. If you ran a standard installation, the image stream will be present.
====
endif::openshift-enterprise[]

The same S2I builder image can be used to build a Java application from source
or from binary artifacts.

[[s2i-images-java-deploy-applications-from-source]]
== Building and Deploying from Source

The Java S2I builder image can be used to build an application from source by running `oc new-app` against a source repository:

ifdef::openshift-online[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app redhat-openjdk18-openshift~https://github.com/jboss-openshift/openshift-quickstarts --context-dir=undertow-servlet
----
endif::openshift-online[]

ifndef::openshift-online[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app registry.redhat.io/redhat-openjdk-18/openjdk18-openshift~https://github.com/jboss-openshift/openshift-quickstarts --context-dir=undertow-servlet
----
endif::openshift-online[]

By default, tests are not run. To build an application and run tests as part of
the build, override the default `MAVEN_ARGS`, as shown in the following command:

ifdef::openshift-online[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app redhat-openjdk18-openshift~<git_repo_URL> --context-dir=<context_dir> --build-env='MAVEN_ARGS=-e -Popenshift -Dcom.redhat.xpaas.repo.redhatga package'
----
endif::openshift-online[]

ifndef::openshift-online[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app registry.redhat.io/redhat-openjdk-18/openjdk18-openshift~<git_repo_URL> --context-dir=<context_dir> --build-env='MAVEN_ARGS=-e -Popenshift -Dcom.redhat.xpaas.repo.redhatga package'
----
endif::openshift-online[]

If a Java project consists of multiple Maven modules, it can be useful to
explicitly specify the artifact output directory. Specifying the directory
where the Maven project outputs the artifacts enables the S2I build to pick
them up.

To specify the modules to build and the artifact output directory, use the
following command:

ifdef::openshift-online[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app redhat-openjdk18-openshift~<git_repo_URL> --context-dir=<context_dir> --build-env='MAVEN_S2I_ARTIFACT_DIRS=relative/path/to/artifacts/dir' --build-env='MAVEN_ARGS=install -pl <groupId>:<artifactId> -am'
----
endif::openshift-online[]

ifndef::openshift-online[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app registry.redhat.io/redhat-openjdk-18/openjdk18-openshift~<git_repo_URL> --context-dir=<context_dir> --build-env='MAVEN_S2I_ARTIFACT_DIRS=relative/path/to/artifacts/dir' --build-env='MAVEN_ARGS=install -pl <groupId>:<artifactId> -am'
----
endif::openshift-online[]

[[s2i-images-java-deploy-applications-from-binary]]
== Building and Deploying from Binary Artifacts

You can use the Java S2I builder image to build an application using binary
artifacts that you provide.

. Create a new binary build:
+
ifdef::openshift-online[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-build --name=<application_name> redhat-openjdk18-openshift --binary=true
----
endif::openshift-online[]

+
ifndef::openshift-online[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-build --name=<application_name> registry.redhat.io/redhat-openjdk-18/openjdk18-openshift --binary=true
----
endif::openshift-online[]

. Start a build and specify the path to the binary artifacts on your local machine:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc start-build <application_name> --from-dir=/path/to/artifacts --follow
----

. Create an application:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app <application_name>

|`4`

|`HTTPS_PROXY`
|The location of the https proxy. This takes precedence over `http_proxy` and `HTTP_PROXY`, and is used for both Maven builds and Java runtime.
|`myuser@127.0.0.1:8080`

|The directory where the application resides. All paths in your application are relative to this directory.
|`myapplication/``

|`JAVA_ARGS`
|Arguments passed to the `java` application.
|-

|`JAVA_CLASSPATH`
|The classpath to use. If not given, the startup script checks for a file `JAVA_APP_DIR/classpath` and uses its content literally as classpath. If this file does not exist, all jars in the app dir are added. (`classes:JAVA_APP_DIR/*`).
|-

|`JAVA_DEBUG`
|If set, remote debugging is switched on. Disabled by default.
|`true`

|`JAVA_DEBUG_PORT`
|Port used for remote debugging. Defaults to `5005`.

|Set this variable to get some diagnostics information to standard output when things are happening. Disabled by default.
|`true`

|`JAVA_INITIAL_MEM_RATIO`
|Used when no `-Xms` option is given in `JAVA_OPTS`. This is used to calculate a default initial heap memory based on the maximum heap memory. If used in a container without any memory constraints for the container, this option has no effect. If there is a memory constraint, `-Xms` is set to a ratio of the `-Xmx` memory as set here. The default is `25` which means 25% of the `-Xmx` is used as the initial heap size. You can skip this mechanism by setting this value to `0`, in which case no `-Xms` option is added.
|`25`

|`JAVA_LIB_DIR`
|Directory holding the Java jar files and an optional `classpath` file which holds the classpath as either a single line classpath (colon separated) or with jar files listed line-by-line. If not set, `JAVA_LIB_DIR` is the same as `JAVA_APP_DIR`.
|-

|`JAVA_MAIN_CLASS`
|A main class to use as the argument for `java`. When this environment variable is given, all jar files in `JAVA_APP_DIR` are added to the classpath and  `JAVA_LIB_DIR`.
|`com.example.MainClass`

|`JAVA_MAX_INITIAL_MEM`
|Used when no `-Xms` option is given in `JAVA_OPTS`. This is used to calculate the maximum value of the initial heap memory. If used in a container without any memory constraints for the container, this option has no effect. If there is a memory constraint, `-Xms` is limited to the value set here. The default is `4096` MB, which means the calculated value of `-Xms` is never greater than 4096 MB. The value of this variable is expressed in MB.
|`4096`

|`JAVA_MAX_MEM_RATIO`
|Used when no `-Xmx` option is given in `JAVA_OPTS`. This is used to calculate a default maximal heap memory based on a containers restriction. If used in a container without any memory constraints for the container, this option has no effect. If there is a memory constraint, `-Xmx` is set to a ratio of the container available memory as set here. The default is `50`, which means 50% of the available memory is used as an upper boundary. You can skip this mechanism by setting this value to `0`, in which case no `-Xmx` option is added.
|-

|`JAVA_OPTS`
|JVM options passed to the `java` command.
|`-verbose:class`

|`JAVA_OPTS_APPEND`
|User specified Java options to be appended to generated options in `JAVA_OPTS`.

|`MAVEN_ARGS`
|Arguments to use when calling Maven, replacing the default `package hawt-app:build -DskipTests -e`. Be sure to run the `hawt-app:build` goal when not already bound to the `package` execution phase, otherwise the startup scripts do not work.
|`-e -Popenshift -DskipTests -Dcom.redhat.xpaas.repo.redhatga package`

|`MAVEN_ARGS_APPEND`
|Additional Maven arguments.
|`-X -am -pl`

|`MAVEN_CLEAR_REPO`
|If set, the Maven repository is removed after the artifact is built. This is useful for keeping the created application image small, but prevents incremental builds. This variable is overridden by `S2I_ENABLE_INCREMENTAL_BUILDS`. Defaults to `false`.
|-

|`MAVEN_LOCAL_REPO`
|Directory to use as the local Maven repository.
|`/home/jboss/.m2/repository`

|`MAVEN_MIRRORS`
|If set, multi-mirror support is enabled, and other `MAVEN_MIRROR_*` variables are prefixed. For example, `DEV_ONE_MAVEN_MIRROR_URL` and `QE_TWO_MAVEN_MIRROR_URL`.
