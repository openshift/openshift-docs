[[benefits-of-using-dot-net-core]]
== Benefits of Using .NET Core

link:http://developers.redhat.com/dotnet/[.NET Core] is a general purpose
development platform featuring automatic memory management and modern
programming languages. It allows users to build high-quality applications
efficiently. .NET Core is available on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL 7) and
{product-title} via certified containers. .NET Core offers:

* The ability to follow a microservices-based approach, where some components are
built with .NET and others with Java, but all can run on a common, supported
platform in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and {product-title}.
* The capacity to more easily develop new .NET Core workloads on Windows;
customers are able to deploy and run on either Red Hat Enterprise Linux or
Windows Server.
* A heterogeneous data center, where the underlying infrastructure is capable of
running .NET applications without having to rely solely on Windows Server.
* Access to many of the popular development frameworks such as .NET, Java, Ruby,
and Python from within {product-title}.

[[dot-net-core-supported-versions]]
== Supported Versions

* .NET Core version 2.1
* .NET Core version 2.0
* .NET Core version 1.1
* .NET Core version 1.0
* Supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
and {product-title} versions 3.3 and later
endif::openshift-enterprise[]

For release details related to .NET Core version 2.1, see
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/net_core/2.1/html/release_notes_for_containers/[Release
Notes for Containers].

Versions 1.1 and 1.0 (`rh-dotnetcore11` and `rh-dotnetcore10`) ship with the
*_project.json_* build system (`1.0.0-preview2` SDK). See the Known Issues
chapter in the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/net-core/1.1/paged/release-notes/[version
1.1 Release Notes] for details on installing this SDK on a non-RHEL system.

[[dot-net-core-installing-images]]
== Images

The RHEL 7 images are available through the Red Hat Registry:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/dotnet/dotnet-21-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/dotnet/dotnet-20-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/dotnet/dotnetcore-11-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/dotnet/dotnetcore-10-rhel7
----

ifdef::openshift-online[]
You can use these images through the `dotnet` image stream.
endif::openshift-online[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Image stream definitions for the .NET Core on RHEL S2I image are
now added during {product-title} installations.
endif::openshift-enterprise[]

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
To use these images, you can either access them directly from the
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-image-registry[image
registry] or push them into your
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#integrated-openshift-registry[{product-title}
Docker registry]. Additionally, you can create an
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[image
stream] that points to the image, either in your Docker registry or at the
external location. Your {product-title} resources can then reference the
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/s2i-dotnetcore/blob/master/dotnet_imagestreams.json[image stream definition].

== Build Process
include::using_images/s2i_images/topics/build_process.adoc[]

[[dot-net-core-configuration]]
== Environment Variables

The .NET Core images support several environment variables, which you can
set to control the build behavior of your .NET Core application.

[NOTE]
====
You must set environment variables that control build behavior in the S2I build
configuration or in the *_.s2i/environment_* file to make them
available to the build steps.
====

.NET Core Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable Name |Description |Default

|`DOTNET_STARTUP_PROJECT`
|Selects projects to run. This must be a project file (for example, *_csproj_* or
*_fsproj_*) or a folder containing a single project file.
|`.`

|`DOTNET_SDK_VERSION`
|Selects the default SDK version when building. If there is a *_global.json_* file
in the source repository, that takes precedence. When set to `latest`, the
latest SDK in the image is used.
|Lowest SDK version available in the image.

|`DOTNET_ASSEMBLY_NAME`
|Selects the assembly to run. This must _not_ include the `.dll` extension. Set
this to the output assembly name specified in *_csproj_*
(`PropertyGroup`/`AssemblyName`).
|The name of the *_csproj_* file.

|`DOTNET_RESTORE_SOURCES`
|Specifies the space-separated list of *NuGet* package sources used during the
restore operation. This overrides all of the sources specified in the
*_NuGet.config_* file.
|

|`DOTNET_TOOLS`
|Specifies a list of .NET tools to install before building the application. To
install a specific version, add `@<version>` to the end of the package name.
|

|`DOTNET_NPM_TOOLS`
|Specifies a list of NPM packages to install before building the application.
|

|`DOTNET_TEST_PROJECTS`
|Specifies the list of test projects to test. This must be project files or
folders containing a single project file. `dotnet test` is invoked for each
item.
|

|`DOTNET_CONFIGURATION`
|Runs the application in `Debug` or `Release` mode. This value should be either
`Release` or `Debug`.
|`Release`

|`DOTNET_VERBOSITY`
|Specifies the verbosity of the dotnet build commands. When set, the
environment variables are printed at the start of the build. This variable can
be set to one of the msbuild verbosity values (`q[uiet]`, `m[inimal]`,
`n[ormal]`, `d[etailed]`, and `diag[nostic]`).
|

|`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`
|Configures the HTTP/HTTPS proxy used when building and running the application.
|

|`NPM_MIRROR`
|Uses a custom NPM registry mirror to download packages during the build process.
|

|`ASPNETCORE_URLS`
|This variable is set to `\http://*:8080` to configure ASP.NET Core to use the
 port exposed by the image. Changing this is _not_ recommended.
|`\http://*:8080`
