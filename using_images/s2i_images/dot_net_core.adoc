[[benefits-of-using-dot-net-core]]
== Benefits of Using .NET Core

link:http://developers.redhat.com/dotnet/[.NET Core] is a general purpose
development platform featuring automatic memory management and modern
programming languages. It allows users to build high-quality applications
efficiently. .NET Core is available on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL 7) and
{product-title} via certified containers. .NET Core offers:

* The ability to follow a microservices-based approach, where some components are
built with .NET and others with Java, but all can run on a common, supported
platform in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and {product-title}.
* The capacity to more easily develop new .NET Core workloads on Windows;
customers are able to deploy and run on either Red Hat Enterprise Linux or
Windows Server.
* A heterogeneous data center, where the underlying infrastructure is capable of
running .NET applications without having to rely solely on Windows Server.
* Access to many of the popular development frameworks such as .NET, Java, Ruby,
and Python from within {product-title}.

[[dot-net-core-supported-versions]]
== Supported Versions

* .NET Core version 2.0
* .NET Core version 1.1
* .NET Core version 1.0
* Supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
and {product-title} versions 3.3 and later
endif::openshift-enterprise[]

The .NET Core software collection for version 2.0 supports the
*_msbuild/csproj_* build system. Versions 1.1 and 1.0 (`rh-dotnetcore11` and
`rh-dotnetcore10`) ships with the *_project.json_* build system
(`1.0.0-preview2` SDK). See the Known Issues chapter in the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/net-core/1.1/paged/release-notes/[version
1.1 Release Notes] for details on installing this SDK on a non-RHEL system.


For release details related to .NET Core version 2.0, see
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/net_core/2.0/html/release_notes_for_rpms/known_issues/[Release
Notes for RPMs] and
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/net_core/2.0/html/release_notes_for_containers/[Release
Notes for Containers].

[[dot-net-core-installing-images]]
== Images

The RHEL 7 images are available through the Red Hat Registry:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/dotnet/dotnet-20-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/dotnet/dotnetcore-11-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/dotnet/dotnetcore-10-rhel7
----

ifdef::openshift-online[]
You can use these images through the `dotnet` image stream.
endif::openshift-online[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Image stream definitions for the .NET Core on RHEL S2I image are
now added during {product-title} installations.
endif::openshift-enterprise[]

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
To use these images, you can either access them directly from the
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-image-registry[image
registry] or push them into your
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#integrated-openshift-registry[{product-title}
Docker registry]. Additionally, you can create an
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[image
stream] that points to the image, either in your Docker registry or at the
external location. Your {product-title} resources can then reference the
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/s2i-dotnetcore/blob/master/dotnet_imagestreams.json[image stream definition].

== Build Process
include::using_images/s2i_images/topics/build_process.adoc[]

[[dot-net-core-configuration]]
== Configuration

The .NET Core images support several environment variables, which you can
set to control the build behavior of your .NET Core application.

[NOTE]
====
You must set environment variables that control build behavior in the S2I build
configuration or in the *_.s2i/environment_* file to make them
available to the build steps.
====

.NET Core Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable Name |Description |Default

|`DOTNET_STARTUP_PROJECT`
|Used to select the project to run. This must be the folder in the source repository containing *_project.json_*.
|*_._*

|`DOTNET_PUBLISH`
|Used to control whether the application should be built by executing `dotnet
build` or `dotnet publish`. To publish the application, set the value to `true`.
It is recommended to publish your application.
|For backwards compatibility, the
default is `false`.

In the next major release, this variable will be removed and the builder will
always publish the application.

|`DOTNET_ASSEMBLY_NAME`
|Used to select the assembly to run. This must _not_ include the `.dll`
extension. Set this to the output assembly name specified in *_project.json_*
(`name`, `buildOptions/outputName`). For *_project.json_*, the assembly name
defaults to the *_project.json_* parent folder. When *_project.json_* is at the
*_context-dir_*, the parent folder name will be *_src_*. So, by default, this
generates a `src.dll` assembly. Setting `DOTNET_ASSEMBLY_NAME` will cause:

  - The assembly to be `<DOTNET_ASSEMBLY_NAME>.dll`
  - The application sources to be in subfolder `DOTNET_ASSEMBLY_NAME` in the deployed container.

|The name of the `DOTNET_STARTUP_PROJECT` folder.

|`DOTNET_RESTORE_SOURCES`
|Used to specify the space-separated list of *NuGet* package sources used during
the restore operation. This overrides all of the sources specified in the
*_NuGet.config_* file.
|Unset

|`DOTNET_NPM_TOOLS`
|Used to specify a list of NPM packages to install before building the application.
|Unset

|`DOTNET_TEST_PROJECTS`
|Used to specify the space-separated list of test projects to run. This must be folders containing
 *_project.json_*. `dotnet test` is invoked for each folder.
|Unset

|`DOTNET_CONFIGURATION`
|Used to run the application in `Debug` or `Release` mode. This value should be
either `Release` or `Debug`.
|`Release`

|`ASPNETCORE_URLS`
|This variable is set to `\http://*:8080` to configure ASP.NET Core to use the
 port exposed by the image. It is _not_ recommended to change this.
|`\http://*:8080`
