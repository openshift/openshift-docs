[[benefits-of-using-dot-net-core]]
== Benefits of Using .NET Core

link:http://developers.redhat.com/dotnet/[.NET Core] is a general purpose
development platform featuring automatic memory management and modern
programming languages. It allows users to build high quality applications
efficiently. .NET Core is available on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL 7) and
{product-title} via certified containers. .NET Core offers:

* The ability to follow a microservices-based approach, where some components are
built with .NET and others with Java, but all can run on a common, supported
platform in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and {product-title}.
* The capacity to more easily develop new .NET Core workloads on Windows;
customers are able to deploy and run on either Red Hat Enterprise Linux or
Windows Server.
* A heterogeneous data center, where the underlying infrastructure is capable of
running .NET applications without having to rely solely on Windows Server.
* Access to many of the popular development frameworks such as .NET, Java, Ruby,
and Python from within {product-title}.

[[dot-net-core-supported-versions]]
== Supported Versions

* .NET Core version 1.0
* .NET Core version 1.1
** Supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7

and {product-title} versions 3.3 and later

[[dot-net-core-installing-images]]
== Images

Image stream definitions for the .NET Core on RHEL S2I image are now added
during {product-title} installations.
endif::openshift-enterprise[]

The RHEL 7 images are available through Red Hat's subscription registry using:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/dotnet/dotnetcore-10-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/dotnet/dotnetcore-11-rhel7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-image-registry[image
registries], or push them into your
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#integrated-openshift-registry[{product-title}
Docker registry]. Additionally, you can create an
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[image
stream] that points to the image, either in your Docker registry or at the
external location. Your {product-title} resources can then reference the
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/s2i-dotnetcore/blob/master/dotnet_imagestreams.json[image stream definition].

[[dot-net-core-configuration]]
== Configuration

The .NET Core image currently does not support any environment variables. No
configuration is necessary.

== Quickly Deploying Applications from .NET Core Source

[IMPORTANT]
====
The
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/s2i-dotnetcore/blob/master/dotnet_imagestreams.json[.NET
image stream] must first be installed. If you ran a standard installation, the
image stream will be present.
====

An image can be used to build an application by running `oc new-app` against a
sample repository:

----
$ oc new-app registry.access.redhat.com/dotnet/dotnetcore-10-rhel7~https://github.com/redhat-developer/s2i-dotnetcore-ex#dotnetcore-1.0 --context-dir=app
$ oc new-app registry.access.redhat.com/dotnet/dotnetcore-11-rhel7~https://github.com/redhat-developer/s2i-dotnetcore-ex#dotnetcore-1.1 --context-dir=app
----

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[NOTE]
====
The `oc new-app` command can detect .NET Core source starting in {product-title} 3.3.
