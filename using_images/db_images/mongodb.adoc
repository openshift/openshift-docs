== Overview
{product-title} provides a container image for running MongoDB.  This image can
provide database services based on username, password, and database name
settings provided via configuration.

== Versions
Currently, {product-title} provides versions
link:https://github.com/sclorg/mongodb-container/tree/master/2.6[2.6],
link:https://github.com/sclorg/mongodb-container/tree/master/3.2[3.2], and
link:https://github.com/sclorg/mongodb-container/tree/master/3.4[3.4] of MongoDB.

== Images

ifdef::openshift-online[]
RHEL 7 images are available through the Red Hat Registry:

----
$ docker pull registry.redhat.io/rhscl/mongodb-26-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.redhat.io/rhscl/mongodb-32-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.redhat.io/rhscl/mongodb-34-rhel7
----

You can use these images through the `mongodb` image stream.
endif::[]

ifndef::openshift-online[]
These images come in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Images*

The RHEL 7 images are available through the Red Hat Registry:

----
$ docker pull registry.redhat.io/rhscl/mongodb-26-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.redhat.io/rhscl/mongodb-32-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.redhat.io/rhscl/mongodb-34-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Images*

These images are available on Docker Hub:

----
$ docker pull centos/mongodb-26-centos7
$ docker pull centos/mongodb-32-centos7
$ docker pull centos/mongodb-34-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these
registries or push them into your {product-title} container image registry. Additionally,
you can create an ImageStream that points to the image,
either in your container image registry or at the external location. Your {product-title}
resources can then reference the ImageStream. You can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example]
ImageStream definitions for all the provided {product-title} images.
endif::[]

== Configuration and usage

=== Initializing the database

You can configure MongoDB with an ephemeral volume or a persistent volume.
The first time you use the volume, the database is created along with the
database administrator user. Afterwards, the MongoDB daemon starts up. If you
are re-attaching the volume to another container, then the database, database
user, and the administrator user are not created, and the MongoDB daemon starts.

The following command creates a new database
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#pods[pod] with
MongoDB running in a container with an ephemeral volume:

----
$ oc new-app \
    -e MONGODB_USER=<username> \
    -e MONGODB_PASSWORD=<password> \
    -e MONGODB_DATABASE=<database_name> \
    -e MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<admin_password> \
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
    registry.redhat.io/rhscl/mongodb-26-rhel7
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
    centos/mongodb-26-centos7
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-online[]
    mongodb:2.6
endif::[]
----

=== Running MongoDB commands in containers

{product-title} uses https://www.softwarecollections.org/[Software Collections] (SCLs)
to install and launch MongoDB. If you want to execute a MongoDB command inside of
a running container (for debugging), you must invoke it using bash.

To do so, first identify the name of the running MongoDB pod. For example, you can
view the list of pods in your current project:

----
$ oc get pods
----

Then, open a remote shell session to the desired pod:

----
$ oc rsh <pod>
----

When you enter the container, the required SCL is automatically enabled.

You can now run *mongo* commands from the bash shell to start a MongoDB
interactive session and perform normal MongoDB operations. For example, to
switch to the *sampledb* database and authenticate as the database user:

----
bash-4.2$ mongo -u $MONGODB_USER -p $MONGODB_PASSWORD $MONGODB_DATABASE
MongoDB shell version: 2.6.9
connecting to: sampledb
>
----

When you are finished, press *CTRL+D* to leave the MongoDB session.

[[mongodb-environment-variables]]
=== Environment Variables

The MongoDB user name, password, database name, and *admin* password must
be configured with the following environment variables:

.MongoDB Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable Name |Description

|`*MONGODB_USER*`
|User name for MongoDB account to be created.

|`*MONGODB_PASSWORD*`
|Password for the user account.

|`*MONGODB_DATABASE*`
|Database name.

|`*MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD*`
|Password for the *admin* user.
|===

[WARNING]
====
You must specify the user name, password, database name, and *admin* password.
If you do not specify all four, the pod will fail to start and {product-title}
will continuously try to restart it.
====

[NOTE]
====
The administrator user name is set to *admin* and you must specify its password
by setting the `*MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD*` environment variable. This process is
done upon database initialization.
====

MongoDB settings can be configured with the following environment variables:

.Additional MongoDB Settings
[cols="3a,6a,1a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable Name |Description |Default

|`*MONGODB_NOPREALLOC*`
|Disable data file preallocation.
|`*true*`

|`*MONGODB_SMALLFILES*`
|Set MongoDB to use a smaller default data file size.
|`*true*`

|`*MONGODB_QUIET*`
|Runs MongoDB in a quiet mode that attempts to limit the amount of output.
|`*true*`

|`*false*`
|===

[NOTE]
====
Text search is enabled by default in MongoDB versions 2.6 and higher, and
therefore has no configurable parameter.
====

=== Volume mount points

The MongoDB image can be run with mounted volumes to enable persistent storage
for the database:

* *_/var/lib/mongodb/data_* - This is the database directory where
MongoDB stores database files.

[[mongodb-changing-passwords]]

=== Changing passwords

Passwords are part of the image configuration, therefore the only supported
method to change passwords for the database user (`*MONGODB_USER*`) and *admin*
user is by changing the environment variables `*MONGODB_PASSWORD*` and
`*MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD*`, respectively.

You can view the current passwords by viewing the pod or deployment
configuration in the web console or by listing the environment variables with
the CLI:

----
$ oc set env pod <pod_name> --list
----

Changing database passwords directly in MongoDB causes a mismatch between the
values stored in the variables and the actual passwords. Whenever a database
container starts, it resets the passwords to the values stored in the
environment variables.

To change these passwords, update one or both of the desired environment
variables for the related deployment configuration(s) using the `oc set env`
command. If multiple deployment configurations utilize these environment
variables, for example in the case of an application created from a template,
you must update the variables on each deployment configuration so that the
passwords are in sync everywhere. This can be done all in the same command:

----
$ oc set env dc <dc_name> [<dc_name_2> ...] \
  MONGODB_PASSWORD=<new_password> \
  MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<new_admin_password>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Depending on your application, there may be other environment variables for
passwords in other parts of the application that should also be updated to
match. For example, there could be a more generic `*DATABASE_USER*` variable in
a front-end pod that should match the database user's password. Ensure that
passwords are in sync for all required environment variables per your
application, otherwise your pods may fail to redeploy when triggered.
====

Updating the environment variables triggers the redeployment of the database
server if you have a
xref:../../dev_guide/deployments/basic_deployment_operations.adoc#config-change-trigger[configuration change
trigger]. Otherwise, you must manually start a new deployment in order to apply
the password changes.

To verify that new passwords are in effect, first open a remote shell session to
the running MongoDB pod:

----
$ oc rsh <pod>
----

From the bash shell, verify the database user's new password:

----
bash-4.2$ mongo -u $MONGODB_USER -p <new_password> $MONGODB_DATABASE --eval "db.version()"
----

If the password was changed correctly, you should see output like this:

----
MongoDB shell version: 2.6.9
connecting to: sampledb
2.6.9
----

To verify the *admin* user's new password:

----
bash-4.2$ mongo -u admin -p <new_admin_password> admin --eval "db.version()"
----

If the password was changed correctly, you should see output like this:

----
MongoDB shell version: 2.6.9
connecting to: admin
2.6.9
----

== Creating a database service from a template

{product-title} provides a xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[template] to make
creating a new database service easy. The template provides parameter fields to
define all the mandatory environment variables (user, password, database name,
etc) with predefined defaults including auto-generation of password values. It
will also define both a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configuration] and a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[service].

The MongoDB templates should have been registered in the default *openshift*
project by your cluster administrator during the initial cluster setup.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
See xref:../../install_config/imagestreams_templates.adoc#install-config-imagestreams-templates[Loading the Default Image Streams and Templates]
for more details, if required.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-online[]
The following template is available:
endif::[]
ifndef::openshift-online[]
There are two templates available:

* `mongodb-ephemeral` is for development/testing purposes only because it uses
ephemeral storage for the database content. This means that if the database
pod is restarted for any reason, such as the pod being moved to another node
or the deployment configuration being updated and triggering a redeploy, all
data will be lost.
endif::[]
* `mongodb-persistent` uses a persistent volume store for the database data
which means the data will survive a pod restart.
ifndef::openshift-online[]
Using persistent volumes requires a persistent volume pool be defined in the
{product-title} deployment.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
Cluster administrator instructions for setting up the pool are located in
xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_nfs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-nfs[Persistent Storage Using NFS].
endif::[]

You can instantiate templates by following these
xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[instructions].

Once you have instantiated the service, you can copy the user name, password,
and database name environment variables into a deployment configuration for
another component that intends to access the database. That component can then
access the database via the service that was defined.

[[using-mongodb-replication]]
== MongoDB replication

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
Replication support provided by the MongoDB image is experimental and should not
be used in production.
====
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[NOTE]
====
Configuration for enabling clustering for database images is provided as an example and
not intended for production use.
====
endif::[]

Red Hat provides a proof-of-concept
xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[template] for MongoDB
replication (clustering) using StatefulSet. You can
obtain the
link:https://github.com/sclorg/mongodb-container/tree/master/examples/petset[example template from GitHub].

For example, to upload the example template into the current project's template
library:

----
$ oc create -f \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sclorg/mongodb-container/master/examples/petset/mongodb-petset-persistent.yaml
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The example template uses persistent storage. You must have persistent volumes
available in your cluster to use this template.
====

As {product-title} automatically restarts unhealthy pods (containers), it will
restart replica set members if one or more of these members crashes or fails.

While a replica set member is down or being restarted, it may be one of these
scenarios:

. PRIMARY member is down:
+
In this case, the other two members elect a new PRIMARY. Until then, reads are
not affected, but the writes fail. After a successful election, writes and reads
process normally.

. One of the SECONDARY member is down:
+
Reads and writes are unaffected. Depending on the `oplogSize` configuration and
the write rate, the third member might fail to join back the replica set,
requiring manual intervention to re-sync its copy of the database.

. Any two members are down:
+
When a three-member replica set member cannot reach any other member, it will
step down from the PRIMARY role if it had it. In this case, reads might be
served by a SECONDARY member, and writes fail. As soon as one more member is
back up, an election picks a new PRIMARY member and reads and writes process
normally.

. All members are down:
+
In this extreme case, both reads and writes fail. After two or more members are
back up, an election reestablishes the replica set to have a PRIMARY and a
SECONDARY member, after which reads and writes process normally.

This is the recommended replication strategy for MongoDB.

[NOTE]
====
For production environments, you must maintain as much separation between
members as possible. It is recommended to use one or more of the node selection
features to schedule StatefulSet pods onto different nodes, and to provide them
storage backed by independent volumes.
====

[[mongodb-replication-limitations]]
=== Limitations
* Only MongoDB 3.2 is supported.
* You have to manually update replica set configuration in case of scaling down.
* Changing a user and administrator password is a manual process. It requires:
** updating values of environment variables in the StatefulSet configuration,
** changing password in the database, and
** restarting all pods one after another.

[[mongodb-replication-using-example-template]]
=== Using the example template
Assuming you already have three pre-created persistent volumes or configured
persistent volume provisioning.

. Create a new poject where you want to create a MongoDB cluster:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc new-project mongodb-cluster-example
----

. Create a new application using the example template:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc new-app https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sclorg/mongodb-container/master/examples/petset/mongodb-petset-persistent.yaml
----
+
This command created a MongoDB cluster with three replica set members.

. Check the status of the new MongoDB pods:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc get pods
NAME        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mongodb-0   1/1       Running   0          50s
mongodb-1   1/1       Running   0          50s
mongodb-2   1/1       Running   0          49s
----

After creating a cluster from the example template, you have a replica set with
three members. Once the pods are running you can perform various actions on
these pods such as:

* Checking logs for one of the pods:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc logs mongodb-0
----

* Log in to the pod:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc rsh mongodb-0
sh-4.2$
----

* Log in to a MongoDB instance:
+
[source,bash]
----
sh-4.2$ mongo $MONGODB_DATABASE -u $MONGODB_USER -p$MONGODB_PASSWORD
MongoDB shell version: 3.2.6
connecting to: sampledb
rs0:PRIMARY>
----

[[mongodb-replication-scale-up]]
=== Scale up
MongoDB recommends an odd number of members in a replica set. If there
are sufficient available persistent volumes, or a dynamic storage provisioner is
present, scaling up is done by using the `oc scale` command:
[source,bash]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=5 statefulsets/mongodb

$ oc get pods
NAME        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mongodb-0   1/1       Running   0          9m
mongodb-1   1/1       Running   0          8m
mongodb-2   1/1       Running   0          8m
mongodb-3   1/1       Running   0          1m
mongodb-4   1/1       Running   0          57s
----

This creates new pods which connect to the replica set and updates its
configuration.

[NOTE]
====
Scaling up an existing database requires manual intervention if the database
size is greater than the `oplogSize` configuration. For such cases, a manual
initial sync of the new members is required. For more information, see
link:https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/troubleshoot-replica-sets/#replica-set-troubleshooting-check-oplog-size[Check the Size of the Oplog] and the
link:https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/replication/[MongoDB Replication]
documentation.
====

[[mongodb-replication-scale-down]]
=== Scale down
To scale down a replica set it is possible to go from five to three members, or
from three to only one member.

Although scaling up may be done without manual intervention when the
preconditions are met (storage availability, size of existing database and
`oplogSize`), scaling down always require manual intervention.

To scale down:

. Set the new number of replicas by using the `oc scale` command:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=3 statefulsets/mongodb
----
+
If the new number of replicas still constitutes a majority of the previous
number, the replica set may elect a new PRIMARY in case one of the pods that was
deleted had the PRIMARY member role. For example, when scaling down from five
members to three members.
+
Alternatively, scaling down to a lower number temporarily renders the replica
set to have only SECONDARY members and be in read-only mode. For example, when
scaling down from five members to only one member.

. Update the replica set configuration to remove members that no longer exist.
+
This may be improved in the future, a possible implementation being setting a `PreStop` pod hook that inspects the number of replicas (exposed via the downward API) and determines that the pod is being removed from the StatefulSet, and not being restarted for some other reason.

. Purge the volume used by the decommissioned pods.
