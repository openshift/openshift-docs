== Overview
{product-title} provides a container image for running MongoDB.  This image can
provide database services based on username, password, and database name
settings provided via configuration.

== Versions
Currently, {product-title} provides versions
https://github.com/openshift/mongodb/tree/master/2.4[2.4], https://github.com/openshift/mongodb/tree/master/2.6[2.6], and https://github.com/openshift/mongodb/tree/master/3.2[3.2] of MongoDB.

== Images

ifdef::openshift-online[]
RHEL 7 images are available through the Red Hat Registry:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/mongodb-24-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/mongodb-26-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/mongodb-32-rhel7
----

You can use these images through the `mongodb` image stream.
endif::[]

ifndef::openshift-online[]
These images come in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Images*

The RHEL 7 images are available through the Red Hat Registry:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/mongodb-24-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/mongodb-26-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/mongodb-32-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Images*

These images are available on Docker Hub:

----
$ docker pull openshift/mongodb-24-centos7
$ docker pull centos/mongodb-26-centos7
$ docker pull centos/mongodb-32-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these
registries or push them into your {product-title} Docker registry. Additionally,
you can create an ImageStream that points to the image,
either in your Docker registry or at the external location. Your {product-title}
resources can then reference the ImageStream. You can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example]
ImageStream definitions for all the provided {product-title} images.
endif::[]

== Configuration and Usage

=== Initializing the Database

You can configure MongoDB with an ephemeral volume or a persistent volume.
The first time you use the volume, the database is created along with the
database administrator user. Afterwards, the MongoDB daemon starts up. If you
are re-attaching the volume to another container, then the database, database
user, and the administrator user are not created, and the MongoDB daemon starts.

The following command creates a new database
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#pods[pod] with
MongoDB running in a container with an ephemeral volume:

----
$ oc new-app \
    -e MONGODB_USER=<username> \
    -e MONGODB_PASSWORD=<password> \
    -e MONGODB_DATABASE=<database_name> \
    -e MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<admin_password> \
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
    registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/mongodb-26-rhel7
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
    centos/mongodb-26-centos7
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-online[]
    mongodb:2.6
endif::[]
----

=== Running MongoDB Commands in Containers

{product-title} uses https://www.softwarecollections.org/[Software Collections] (SCLs)
to install and launch MongoDB. If you want to execute a MongoDB command inside of
a running container (for debugging), you must invoke it using bash.

To do so, first identify the name of the running MongoDB pod. For example, you can
view the list of pods in your current project:

----
$ oc get pods
----

Then, open a remote shell session to the desired pod:

----
$ oc rsh <pod>
----

When you enter the container, the required SCL is automatically enabled.

You can now run *mongo* commands from the bash shell to start a MongoDB
interactive session and perform normal MongoDB operations. For example, to
switch to the *sampledb* database and authenticate as the database user:

====
----
bash-4.2$ mongo -u $MONGODB_USER -p $MONGODB_PASSWORD $MONGODB_DATABASE
MongoDB shell version: 2.4.9
connecting to: sampledb
>
----
====

When you are finished, press *CTRL+D* to leave the MongoDB session.

=== Environment Variables

The MongoDB user name, password, database name, and *admin* password must
be configured with the following environment variables:

.MongoDB Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable Name |Description

|`*MONGODB_USER*`
|User name for MongoDB account to be created.

|`*MONGODB_PASSWORD*`
|Password for the user account.

|`*MONGODB_DATABASE*`
|Database name.

|`*MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD*`
|Password for the *admin* user.
|===

[WARNING]
====
You must specify the user name, password, database name, and *admin* password.
If you do not specify all four, the pod will fail to start and {product-title}
will continuously try to restart it.
====

[NOTE]
====
The administrator user name is set to *admin* and you must specify its password
by setting the `*MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD*` environment variable. This process is
done upon database initialization.
====

MongoDB settings can be configured with the following environment variables:

.Additional MongoDB Settings
[cols="3a,6a,1a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable Name |Description |Default

|`*MONGODB_NOPREALLOC*`
|Disable data file preallocation.
|`*true*`

|`*MONGODB_SMALLFILES*`
|Set MongoDB to use a smaller default data file size.
|`*true*`

|`*MONGODB_QUIET*`
|Runs MongoDB in a quiet mode that attempts to limit the amount of output.
|`*true*`

|`*MONGODB_TEXT_SEARCH_ENABLED*`
|(MongoDB version 2.4 only) Enables the https://docs.mongodb.org/v2.4/core/index-text/#text-search-text-command[text search] feature.

[NOTE]
====
Text search is enabled by default in MongoDB versions 2.6 and higher, and therefore has no configurable parameter.
====

|`*false*`
|===

=== Volume Mount Points

The MongoDB image can be run with mounted volumes to enable persistent storage
for the database:

* *_/var/lib/mongodb/data_* - This is the database directory where
MongoDB stores database files.

[[mongodb-changing-passwords]]

=== Changing Passwords

Passwords are part of the image configuration, therefore the only supported
method to change passwords for the database user (`*MONGODB_USER*`) and *admin*
user is by changing the environment variables `*MONGODB_PASSWORD*` and
`*MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD*`, respectively.

You can view the current passwords by viewing the pod or deployment
configuration in the web console or by listing the environment variables with
the CLI:

----
$ oc set env pod <pod_name> --list
----

Changing database passwords directly in MongoDB causes a mismatch between the
values stored in the variables and the actual passwords. Whenever a database
container starts, it resets the passwords to the values stored in the
environment variables.

To change these passwords, update one or both of the desired environment
variables for the related deployment configuration(s) using the `oc set env`
command. If multiple deployment configurations utilize these environment
variables, for example in the case of an application created from a template,
you must update the variables on each deployment configuration so that the
passwords are in sync everywhere. This can be done all in the same command:

----
$ oc set env dc <dc_name> [<dc_name_2> ...] \
  MONGODB_PASSWORD=<new_password> \
  MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<new_admin_password>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Depending on your application, there may be other environment variables for
passwords in other parts of the application that should also be updated to
match. For example, there could be a more generic `*DATABASE_USER*` variable in
a front-end pod that should match the database user's password. Ensure that
passwords are in sync for all required environment variables per your
application, otherwise your pods may fail to redeploy when triggered.
====

Updating the environment variables triggers the redeployment of the database
server if you have a
xref:../../dev_guide/deployments/basic_deployment_operations.adoc#config-change-trigger[configuration change
trigger]. Otherwise, you must manually start a new deployment in order to apply
the password changes.

To verify that new passwords are in effect, first open a remote shell session to
the running MongoDB pod:

----
$ oc rsh <pod>
----

From the bash shell, verify the database user's new password:

----
bash-4.2$ mongo -u $MONGODB_USER -p <new_password> $MONGODB_DATABASE --eval "db.version()"
----

If the password was changed correctly, you should see output like this:

====
----
MongoDB shell version: 2.6.9
connecting to: sampledb
2.6.9
----
====

To verify the *admin* user's new password:

----
bash-4.2$ mongo -u admin -p <new_admin_password> admin --eval "db.version()"
----

If the password was changed correctly, you should see output like this:

====
----
MongoDB shell version: 2.4.9
connecting to: admin
2.4.9
----
====

== Creating a Database Service from a Template

{product-title} provides a xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[template] to make
creating a new database service easy. The template provides parameter fields to
define all the mandatory environment variables (user, password, database name,
etc) with predefined defaults including auto-generation of password values. It
will also define both a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configuration] and a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[service].

The MongoDB templates should have been registered in the default *openshift*
project by your cluster administrator during the initial cluster setup.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
See xref:../../install_config/imagestreams_templates.adoc#install-config-imagestreams-templates[Loading the Default Image Streams and Templates]
for more details, if required.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-online[]
The following template is available:
endif::[]
ifndef::openshift-online[]
There are two templates available:

* `mongodb-ephemeral` is for development/testing purposes only because it uses
ephemeral storage for the database content. This means that if the database
pod is restarted for any reason, such as the pod being moved to another node
or the deployment configuration being updated and triggering a redeploy, all
data will be lost.
endif::[]
* `mongodb-persistent` uses a persistent volume store for the database data
which means the data will survive a pod restart.
ifndef::openshift-online[]
Using persistent volumes requires a persistent volume pool be defined in the
{product-title} deployment.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
Cluster administrator instructions for setting up the pool are located
xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_nfs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-nfs[here].
endif::[]

You can find instructions for instantiating templates by following these
xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[instructions].

Once you have instantiated the service, you can copy the user name, password,
and database name environment variables into a deployment configuration for
another component that intends to access the database. That component can then
access the database via the service that was defined.

[[using-mongodb-replication]]
== Using MongoDB Replication

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
Replication support provided by the MongoDB image is experimental and should not
be used in production.
====
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[NOTE]
====
Enabling clustering for database images is currently in Technology Preview and
not intended for production use.
====
endif::[]

Red Hat provides a proof-of-concept
xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[template] for MongoDB
replication (clustering); you can obtain the
https://github.com/openshift/mongodb/tree/master/2.4/examples/replica[example
template from GitHub].

For example, to upload the example template into the current project's template
library:

====
----
$ oc create -f \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/mongodb/master/2.4/examples/replica/mongodb-clustered.json
----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The example template does not use persistent storage. When
you lose all members of the replication set, your data will be lost.
====

The following sections detail the objects defined in the example template and
describe how they work together to start a cluster of MongoDB servers
implementing master-slave replication and automated failover. This is the
recommended replication strategy for MongoDB.

[[creating-the-deploymentconfig]]
=== Creating the Deployment Configuration

To set up MongoDB replication, a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configuration] is defined in the example template that defines a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#replication-controllers[replication
controller]. The replication controller manages the members of the MongoDB
cluster.

To tell a MongoDB server that the member will be part of the cluster, additional
environment variables are provided for the container defined in the replication
controller pod template:

[cols="3a,6a,1a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable Name |Description |Default

|`*MONGODB_REPLICA_NAME*`
|Specifies the name of the replication set.
|*rs0*

|`*MONGODB_KEYFILE_VALUE*`
|See: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/generate-key-file[Generate a Key
File]
|*generated*

----
====

After the deployment configuration is created and the pods with MongoDB cluster
members are started, they will not be initialized. Instead, they start as part
of the *rs0* replication set, as the value of `*MONGODB_REPLICA_NAME*` is set to
*rs0* by default.

[[creating-the-service-pod]]
=== Creating the Service Pod

To initialize members created by xref:creating-the-deploymentconfig[the
deployment configuration], the pods are started with the `initiate` argument,
which instructs the startup script to behave xref:mongo-creating-headless-service[slightly differently]
than a regular, stand-alone MongoDB database.

[[mongo-creating-headless-service]]
=== Creating a Headless Service

The `initiate` argument in the xref:example-deployment-config[container specification
above] instructs the container to first discover all running member pods within
the MongoDB cluster. To achieve this, a _headless service_ is defined named
*mongodb* in the example template.

To have a headless service, the `*portalIP*` parameter in the service definition
is set to *None*. Then you can use a DNS query to get a list of the pod IP
addresses that represents the current endpoints for this service.

[[creating-the-final-replication-set]]
=== Creating the Final Replication Set

When the script that runs as the container entrypoint has the IP addresses of
all running MongoDB members, it creates a MongoDB replication set configuration
where it lists all member IP addresses. It then initiates the replication set
using `rs.initiate(config)`. The script waits until MongoDB elects the *PRIMARY*
member of the cluster.

Once the *PRIMARY* member has been elected, the entrypoint script starts
creating MongoDB users and databases.

Clients can then start using the MongoDB instance by sending the queries to the
*mongodb* service. As this service is a headless service, they do not need to
provide the IP address. Clients can use *mongodb:27017* for connections. The
service then sends the query to one of the members in the replication set.

[[scaling-mongodb-replication-set]]
=== Scaling the MongoDB Replication Set

To xref:../../dev_guide/deployments/basic_deployment_operations.adoc#scaling[increase the number of members]
in the cluster:

----
$ oc scale rc mongodb-1 --replicas=<number>
----

This tells xref:creating-the-deploymentconfig[the replication controller] to
create a new MongoDB member pod. When a new member is created, the member
entrypoint first attempts to discover other running members in the cluster. It
then chooses one and adds itself to the list of members. Once the replication
configuration is updated, the other members replicate the data to a new pod and
start a new election.
