== Overview
OpenShift provides a Docker image for running PostgreSQL.  This image can
provide database services based on username, password, and database name
settings provided via configuration.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift supports version
https://github.com/openshift/postgresql/tree/master/9.2[9.2] and https://github.com/openshift/postgresql/tree/master/9.4[9.4] of PostgreSQL.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry via:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/postgresql-92-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/postgresql-92-centos7
----

or

----
$ docker pull centos/postgresql-94-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these
registries or push them into your OpenShift docker registry. Additionally,
you can create an ImageStream that points to the image,
either in your docker registry or at the external location. Your OpenShift
resources can then reference the ImageStream. You can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example]
ImageStream definitions for all the provided OpenShift images.

== Configuration and Usage

=== Initializing the Database

The first time you use the shared volume, the database is created along with the
database administrator user and the PostgreSQL postgres user (if you specify the
`*POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD*` environment variable). Afterwards, the PostgreSQL
daemon starts up. If you are re-attaching the volume to another container, then
the database, the database user, and the administrator user are not created, and
the PostgreSQL daemon starts.

The following command creates a new database
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#pods[pod] with
PostgreSQL running in a container:

----
$ oc new-app -e \
    POSTGRESQL_USER=<username>,POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=<password>,POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=<database_name> \
    centos/postgresql-94-centos7
----

=== Running PostgreSQL Commands in Containers

OpenShift uses https://www.softwarecollections.org/[Software Collections] to
install and launch PostgreSQL. If you want to execute a PostgreSQL command
inside of a running container (for debugging), you must invoke it using bash to
make sure the PostgreSQL collection is enabled. For example:

----
$ oc exec -it -p <pod> -c <container> /bin/bash -c psql
----

To enter a container from the host:

----
$ oc exec -it -p <pod> -c <container> /bin/bash
----

When you enter the container, the required software collection is
automatically enabled.

=== Environment Variables

The PostgreSQL user name, password, and database name must be configured with
the following environment variables:

.PostgreSQL Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable Name |Description

|`*POSTGRESQL_USER*`
|User name for the PostgreSQL account to be created. This user has full rights
to the database.

|`*POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD*`
|Password for the user account.

|`*POSTGRESQL_DATABASE*`
|Database name.

|`*POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD*`
|Optional password for the *postgres* administrator user. If this is not set,
then remote login to the *postgres* account is not possible. Local connections
from within the container are always permitted without a password.
|===

[WARNING]
====
You must specify the user name, password, and database name. If you do not
specify all three, the pod will fail to start and OpenShift will continuously
try to restart it.
====

PostgreSQL settings can be configured with the following environment variables:

.Additional PostgreSQL settings
[cols="3a,6a,1a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable Name |Description |Default

|`*POSTGRESQL_MAX_CONNECTIONS*`
|The maximum number of client connections allowed. This also sets the maximum
number of prepared transactions.
|100

|`*POSTGRESQL_SHARED_BUFFERS*`
|Configures how much memory is dedicated to PostgreSQL for caching data.
|32M
|===

=== Volume Mount Points

The PostgreSQL image can be run with mounted volumes to enable persistent
storage for the database:

* *_/var/lib/pgsql/data_* - This is the database cluster directory where
PostgreSQL stores database files.

[[postgresql-changing-passwords]]

=== Changing Passwords

Passwords are part of the image configuration, therefore the only supported
method to change passwords for the database user (`*POSTGRESQL_USER*`) and
*postgres* administrator user is by changing the environment variables
`*POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD*` and `*POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD*`, respectively.

Changing database passwords through SQL statements or any way other than through
the environment variables aforementioned will cause a mismatch between the
values stored in the variables and the actual passwords. Whenever a database
container starts, it resets the passwords to the values stored in the
environment variables.

You can change these passwords with:

----
$ oc env dc postgresql \
  POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=<new_password> \
  POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<new_admin_password>
----

This triggers the redeployment of the database server if you have a
link:../../dev_guide/deployments.html#config-change-trigger[configuration change
trigger]. Otherwise, you must manually start a new deployment in order to apply
the password changes.

Note that you can change one password but not the other by simply omitting one
of the arguments to `oc env` above.

You can verify that the new password is in effect with:

====
----
$ oc get pods
...
$ oc exec <db_podname> -- bash -c 'PGPASSWORD=NewPassword psql -h postgresql $POSTGRESQL_DATABASE $POSTGRESQL_USER -c "SELECT * FROM (SELECT current_database()) cdb CROSS JOIN (SELECT current_user) cu"'
----
====

Replace `<db_podname>` with the name of the running PostgreSQL pod. If the
password was changed correctly, you should see a table like this:

====
----
 current_database | current_user
------------------+--------------
 sampledb         | user
(1 row)
----
====

== Creating a Database Service from a Template

OpenShift provides a link:../../dev_guide/templates.html[template] to make
creating a new database service easy. The template provides parameter fields to
define all the mandatory environment variables (user, password, database name,
etc) with predefined defaults including auto-generation of password values. It
will also define both a
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configuration] and a
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services[service].

The PostgreSQL templates should have been registered in the default *openshift*
project by your cluster administrator during the
link:../../install_config/install/first_steps.html[First Steps] setup process.
There are two templates available:

* `PostgreSQL-ephemeral` is for development or testing purposes only because it
uses ephemeral storage for the database content. This means that if the
database pod is restarted for any reason, such as the pod being moved to
another node or the deployment configuration being updated and triggering a
redeploy, all data will be lost.
* `PostgreSQL-persistent` uses a persistent volume store for the database data
which means the data will survive a pod restart. Using persistent volumes
requires a persistent volume pool be defined in the OpenShift deployment.
Cluster administrator instructions for setting up the pool are located
link:../../admin_guide/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_nfs.html[here].

You can find instructions for instantiating templates by following these
link:../../dev_guide/templates.html#creating-resources-from-a-template[instructions].

Once you have instantiated the service, you can copy the user name, password,
and database name environment variables into a deployment configuration for
another component that intends to access the database. That component can then
access the database via the service that was defined.
