== Overview
OpenShift provides a Docker image for running PostgreSQL.  This image can
provide database services based on username, password, and database name
settings provided via configuration.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift supports version
https://github.com/openshift/postgresql/tree/master/9.2[9.2] and https://github.com/openshift/postgresql/tree/master/9.4[9.4] of PostgreSQL.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry via:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/postgresql-92-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/postgresql-92-centos7
----

or

----
$ docker pull centos/postgresql-94-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these
registries or push them into your OpenShift Docker registry. Additionally,
you can create an ImageStream that points to the image,
either in your Docker registry or at the external location. Your OpenShift
resources can then reference the ImageStream. You can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example]
ImageStream definitions for all the provided OpenShift images.

== Configuration and Usage

=== Initializing the Database

The first time you use the shared volume, the database is created along with the
database administrator user and the PostgreSQL postgres user (if you specify the
`*POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD*` environment variable). Afterwards, the PostgreSQL
daemon starts up. If you are re-attaching the volume to another container, then
the database, the database user, and the administrator user are not created, and
the PostgreSQL daemon starts.

The following command creates a new database
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#pods[pod] with
PostgreSQL running in a container:

----
$ oc new-app -e \
    POSTGRESQL_USER=<username>,POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=<password>,POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=<database_name> \
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
    registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/postgresql-94-rhel7
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
    centos/postgresql-94-centos7
endif::[]
----

=== Running PostgreSQL Commands in Containers

OpenShift uses https://www.softwarecollections.org/[Software Collections] (SCLs) to
install and launch PostgreSQL. If you want to execute a PostgreSQL command
inside of a running container (for debugging), you must invoke it using bash.

To do so, first identify the name of the running PostgreSQL pod. For example,
you can view the list of pods in your current project:

----
$ oc get pods
----

Then, open a remote shell session to the desired pod:

----
$ oc rsh <pod>
----

When you enter the container, the required SCL is automatically enabled.

You can now run the *psql* command from the bash shell to start a PostgreSQL
interactive session and perform normal PostgreSQL operations. For example, to
authenticate as the database user:

====
----
bash-4.2$ PGPASSWORD=$POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD psql -h postgresql $POSTGRESQL_DATABASE $POSTGRESQL_USER
psql (9.2.8)
Type "help" for help.

default=>
----
====

When you are finished, enter *\q* to leave the PostgreSQL session.

=== Environment Variables

The PostgreSQL user name, password, and database name must be configured with
the following environment variables:

.PostgreSQL Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable Name |Description

|`*POSTGRESQL_USER*`
|User name for the PostgreSQL account to be created. This user has full rights
to the database.

|`*POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD*`
|Password for the user account.

|`*POSTGRESQL_DATABASE*`
|Database name.

|`*POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD*`
|Optional password for the *postgres* administrator user. If this is not set,
then remote login to the *postgres* account is not possible. Local connections
from within the container are always permitted without a password.
|===

[WARNING]
====
You must specify the user name, password, and database name. If you do not
specify all three, the pod will fail to start and OpenShift will continuously
try to restart it.
====

PostgreSQL settings can be configured with the following environment variables:

.Additional PostgreSQL settings
[cols="3a,6a,1a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable Name |Description |Default

|`*POSTGRESQL_MAX_CONNECTIONS*`
|The maximum number of client connections allowed. This also sets the maximum
number of prepared transactions.
|100

|`*POSTGRESQL_SHARED_BUFFERS*`
|Configures how much memory is dedicated to PostgreSQL for caching data.
|32M
|===

=== Volume Mount Points

The PostgreSQL image can be run with mounted volumes to enable persistent
storage for the database:

* *_/var/lib/pgsql/data_* - This is the database cluster directory where
PostgreSQL stores database files.

[[postgresql-changing-passwords]]

=== Changing Passwords

Passwords are part of the image configuration, therefore the only supported
method to change passwords for the database user (`*POSTGRESQL_USER*`) and
*postgres* administrator user is by changing the environment variables
`*POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD*` and `*POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD*`, respectively.

You can view the current passwords by viewing the pod or deployment
configuration in the web console or by listing the environment variables with
the CLI:

----
$ oc env pod <pod_name> --list
----

Changing database passwords through SQL statements or any way other than through
the environment variables aforementioned will cause a mismatch between the
values stored in the variables and the actual passwords. Whenever a database
container starts, it resets the passwords to the values stored in the
environment variables.

To change these passwords, update one or both of the desired environment
variables for the related deployment configuration(s) using the `oc env`
command. If multiple deployment configurations utilize these environment
variables, for example in the case of an application created from a template,
you must update the variables on each deployment configuration so that the
passwords are in sync everywhere. This can be done all in the same command:

----
$ oc env dc <dc_name> [<dc_name_2> ...] \
  POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=<new_password> \
  POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<new_admin_password>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Depending on your application, there may be other environment variables for
passwords in other parts of the application that should also be updated to
match. For example, there could be a more generic `*DATABASE_USER*` variable in
a front-end pod that should match the database user's password. Ensure that
passwords are in sync for all required environment variables per your
application, otherwise your pods may fail to redeploy when triggered.
====

Updating the environment variables triggers the redeployment of the database
server if you have a
link:../../dev_guide/deployments.html#config-change-trigger[configuration change
trigger]. Otherwise, you must manually start a new deployment in order to apply
the password changes.

To verify that new passwords are in effect, first open a remote shell session to
the running PostgreSQL pod:

----
$ oc rsh <pod>
----

From the bash shell, verify the database user's new password:

----
bash-4.2$ PGPASSWORD=<new_password> psql -h postgresql $POSTGRESQL_DATABASE $POSTGRESQL_USER -c "SELECT * FROM (SELECT current_database()) cdb CROSS JOIN (SELECT current_user) cu"
----

If the password was changed correctly, you should see a table like this:

====
----
 current_database | current_user
------------------+--------------
 default          | django
(1 row)
----
====

From the bash shell, verify the *postgres* administrator user's new password:

----
bash-4.2$ PGPASSWORD=<new_admin_password> psql -h postgresql $POSTGRESQL_DATABASE postgres -c "SELECT * FROM (SELECT current_database()) cdb CROSS JOIN (SELECT current_user) cu"
----

If the password was changed correctly, you should see a table like this:

====
----
 current_database | current_user
------------------+--------------
 default          | postgres
(1 row)
----
====

== Creating a Database Service from a Template

OpenShift provides a link:../../dev_guide/templates.html[template] to make
creating a new database service easy. The template provides parameter fields to
define all the mandatory environment variables (user, password, database name,
etc) with predefined defaults including auto-generation of password values. It
will also define both a
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configuration] and a
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services[service].

The PostgreSQL templates should have been registered in the default *openshift*
project by your cluster administrator during the initial cluster setup.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
See link:../../install_config/install/first_steps.html[First Steps] for more
details, if required.
endif::[]

There are two templates available:

* `PostgreSQL-ephemeral` is for development or testing purposes only because it
uses ephemeral storage for the database content. This means that if the
database pod is restarted for any reason, such as the pod being moved to
another node or the deployment configuration being updated and triggering a
redeploy, all data will be lost.
* `PostgreSQL-persistent` uses a persistent volume store for the database data
which means the data will survive a pod restart. Using persistent volumes
requires a persistent volume pool be defined in the OpenShift deployment.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
Cluster administrator instructions for setting up the pool are located
link:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_nfs.html[here].
endif::[]

You can find instructions for instantiating templates by following these
link:../../dev_guide/templates.html#creating-resources-from-a-template[instructions].

Once you have instantiated the service, you can copy the user name, password,
and database name environment variables into a deployment configuration for
another component that intends to access the database. That component can then
access the database via the service that was defined.
