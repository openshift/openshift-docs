== Overview
OpenShift provides
link:../../architecture/core_objects/builds.html#source-build[S2I] enabled
PHP images for building and running PHP applications.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
The https://github.com/openshift/sti-php[PHP S2I builder image]
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The PHP S2I builder image
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
assembles your application source with any required dependencies to create a
new image containing your PHP application. This resulting image can be run
either by OpenShift or by Docker.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift provides version
https://github.com/openshift/sti-php/tree/master/5.5[5.5] of PHP.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry via:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/php-55-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/php-55-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.html[image registries],
or push them into your
link:../../admin_guide/docker_registry.html[OpenShift docker registry].
Additionally, you can create an
link:../../architecture/core_objects/openshift_model.html#imagestream[ImageStream]
that points to the image, either in your docker registry or at the external
location. Your OpenShift resources can then reference the ImageStream. You
can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example]
ImageStream definitions for all the provided OpenShift images.

== Configuration
The PHP image supports a number of environment variables which can be set to
control the configuration and behavior of the PHP runtime.

To set these environment variables, you can place them into `.sti/environment`
file inside your source code repository, or define them in the environment
section of the BuildConfig Source Strategy definition.

The following environment variables set their equivalent property value in the
php.ini file:

.PHP Environment Variables

|E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE

|`*DISPLAY_ERRORS*`

|`*DISPLAY_STARTUP_ERRORS*`

If the `*DocumentRoot*` of the application is nested in the source directory
*_/opt/openshift/src_*, you can provide your own *_.htaccess_* file to override
the default Apache behavior and specify how application requests should be
handled. The *_.htaccess_* file must be located at the root of the application
source.
