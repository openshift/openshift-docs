== Overview
Our OpenShift https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby/tree/master/2.0[Ruby] image repository contains the sources and Dockerfiles for building various versions of Ruby platform images. The resulting images can be run either by Docker or using https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[STI].

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift only supports version https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby/tree/master/2.0[2.0] of Ruby.

== Base Images

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

[NOTE]
====
RHEL 7 image is not available as trusted build in https://index.docker.io[Docker Index]. In order to perform build or test action on a RHEL 7 based Ruby image, you need to run the build on properly subscribed RHEL 7 machine.
====

== Installation
To build a Ruby image, choose between a RHEL 7 or CentOS 7 base image:

=== RHEL 7 base image

----
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby.git
$ cd sti-ruby
$ make build TARGET=rhel7 VERSION=2.0
----

=== CentOS 7 Base Image

----
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby.git
$ cd sti-ruby
$ make build VERSION=2.0
----

[NOTE]
====
If you omit the `VERSION` parameter, the build/test action is performed on all supported versions of Ruby. Since version `2.0` is the only version supported, you can omit this parameter.
====

== Usage
To build a simple https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby/tree/master/2.0/test/puma-test-app[ruby-sample-app] Ruby application, use a standalone https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[STI] and run the resulting image using http://docker.io[Docker]

=== RHEL 7 Base Image

----
$ sti build https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby.git --contextDir=/2.0/test/puma-test-app/ openshift/ruby-20-rhel7 ruby-sample-app
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 ruby-sample-app
----

=== CentOS 7 Base Image

----
$ sti build https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby.git --contextDir=/2.0/test/puma-test-app/ openshift/ruby-20-centos7 ruby-sample-app
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 ruby-sample-app
----

To access and test if the application is running:

----
$ curl 127.0.0.1:8080
----

== Test
The OpenShift https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby/tree/master/2.0[STI-Ruby] repository also provides the STI test framework, which tests the functionality of a simple Ruby application built on top of STI-Ruby image.

=== RHEL7 Base Image

----
$ cd sti-ruby
$ make test TARGET=rhel7 VERSION=2.0
----

=== CentOS 7 Base Image

----
$ cd sti-ruby
$ make test VERSION=2.0
----

[NOTE]
====
If you omit the `VERSION` parameter, the build/test action is performed on all supported versions of Ruby. Since version `2.0` is the only version supported, you can omit this parameter.

== Image Name Structure

Use the following image name structure:

****
`openshift/[replaceable]#<platform_name>#-[replaceable]#<platform_version>#-[replaceable]#<base_builder_image>#`
****

Where:

. [replaceable]#<platform_name># - Refers to the STI platform; for example, `ruby`
. [replaceable]#<platform_version># - The version of the referenced platform, without dots; for example, `20` for Ruby 2.0
. [replaceable]#<Base_builder_image># - The base OS, such as `rhel7` or `centos7`

.Example image names:
====

----
openshift/ruby-20-centos7

openshift/ruby-20-rhel7
----
====

== Environment Variables

To set these environment variables, you can place them into `.sti/environment`
file inside your source code repository.

* [envvar]#RACK_ENV# - This variable specifies the environment within which the Ruby application is deployed; for example, `production`, `development`, or `test`. Each level has different behavior in terms of logging verbosity, error pages, and ruby gem installation. The application assets are only compiled if [envvar]#RACK_ENV# is set to `production`.

* [envvar]#RAILS_ENV# - This variable specifies the environment within which the Ruby on Rails application is deployed; for example, `production`, `development`, or `test`. Each level has different behavior in terms of logging verbosity, error pages, and ruby gem installation. The application assets are only compiled if [envvar]#RAILS_ENV# is set to `production`.

* [envvar]#DISABLE_ASSET_COMPILATION# - This variable indicates that the process of asset compilation can be skipped. Asset compilation only happens when the application runs in a production environment. Therefore, you can use this variable when assets have already been compiled.
