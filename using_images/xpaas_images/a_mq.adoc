== Overview

Red Hat JBoss A-MQ (JBoss A-MQ) is available as a containerized xPaaS image that
is designed for use with OpenShift. It allows developers to quickly deploy an
A-MQ message broker in a hybrid cloud environment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
There are significant differences in supported configurations and functionality
in the JBoss A-MQ image compared to the regular release of JBoss A-MQ.
====

This topic details the differences between the JBoss A-MQ xPaaS image and the
regular release of JBoss A-MQ, and provides instructions specific to running and
configuring the JBoss A-MQ xPaaS image. Documentation for other JBoss A-MQ
functionality not specific to the JBoss A-MQ xPaaS image can be found in the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_A-MQ/[JBoss A-MQ
documentation on the Red Hat Customer Portal].

== Differences Between the JBoss A-MQ xPaaS Image and the Regular Release of JBoss A-MQ

There are several major functionality differences in the OpenShift JBoss A-MQ
xPaaS image:

* The Karaf shell is not available.
* The Fuse Management Console (Hawtio) is not available.
* Configuration of the broker can be performed:
** using parameters specified in the A-MQ application template, as described in
xref:configuring-params[Application Template Parameters].
** using the STI (Source-to-image) tool, as described in
xref:configuring-sti[Configuration Using STI].


== Installing the JBoss A-MQ xPaaS Image Streams and Application Templates

To use the Red Hat xPaaS middleware images in your OpenShift project, you must
first
link:../../admin_guide/install/first_steps.html#creating-image-streams-for-xpaas-middleware-images[install
the image streams] and
link:../../admin_guide/install/first_steps.html#creating-quickstart-templates[Source-to-Image
(S2I) application templates].

== Configuring the JBoss A-MQ Image

[[configuring-params]]
=== Application Template Parameters

Basic configuration of the JBoss A-MQ xPaaS image is performed by specifying
values of application template parameters. The following parameters can be
configured:

`*AMQ_RELEASE*`::
  The JBoss A-MQ release version. This determines which JBoss A-MQ image will be
  used as a basis for the application. At the moment, only version _6.2_ is
  available.
`*APPLICATION_NAME*`::
  The name of the application used internally in OpenShift. It is used in names
  of services, pods, and other objects within the application.
`*MQ_USERNAME*`::
  The user name used for authentication to the broker. In a standard
  non-containerized JBoss A-MQ, you would specify the user name in the
  *_AMQ_HOME/opt/user.properties_* file. If no value is specified, a random user
  name is generated.
`*MQ_PASSWORD*`::
  The password used for authentication to the broker. In a standard
  non-containerized JBoss A-MQ, you would specify the password in the
  *_AMQ_HOME/opt/user.properties_* file. If no value is specified, a random
  password is generated.
`*MQ_PROTOCOL*`::
  Comma-separated list of the messaging protocols used by the broker. Available
  options are _amqp_, _mqtt_, _openwire_, and _stomp_. If left empty, all
  available protocols will be available. Please note that for integration of the
  image with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, the _openwire_
  protocol must be specified, while other protocols can be optionally specified
  as well.
`*MQ_QUEUES*`::
  Comma-separated list of queues available by default on the broker on its
  startup.
`*MQ_TOPICS*`::
  Comma-separated list of topics available by default on the broker on its
  startup.

[[configuring-sti]]
=== Configuration Using STI

Configuration of the JBoss A-MQ image can also be modified using the
Source-to-image feature, described in full detail at
link:../../creating_images/s2i.html[S2I Requirements].

Custom A-MQ broker configuration can be specified by creating an
*_openshift-activemq.xml_* file inside the *_git_* directory of your
application's Git project root. On each commit, the file will be copied to the
*_conf_* directory in the A-MQ root and its contents used to configure the
broker.

== Security

Only SSL connections can connect from outside of the OpenShift instance,
regardless of the protocol specified in the `*MQ_PROTOCOL*` property of the A-MQ
application templates. The non-SSL version of the protocols can only be used
inside the OpenShift instance.

For security reasons, using the default KeyStore and TrustStore generated by the
system is discouraged. It is recommended to generate your own KeyStore and
TrustStore and supply them to the image using the OpenShift secrets mechanism or
STI.

== Scalability

It is possible to run multiple JBoss A-MQ containers on a single OpenShift
instance at the same time. However, real-time scalability is not supported as
messages stored on a discarded broker would be lost when downscaling.

== Logging

In addition to viewing the OpenShift logs, you can troubleshoot a running JBoss
A-MQ image by viewing the JBoss A-MQ logs that are outputted to the container's
console:

----
$ oc logs -f <pod_name> <container_name>
----

[NOTE]
====
By default, the OpenShift JBoss A-MQ xPaaS image does not have a file log
handler configured. Logs are only sent to the console.
