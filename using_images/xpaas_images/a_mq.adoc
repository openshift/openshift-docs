== Overview

Red Hat JBoss A-MQ (JBoss A-MQ) is available as a containerized xPaaS image that
is designed for use with OpenShift. It allows developers to quickly deploy an
A-MQ message broker in a hybrid cloud environment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
There are significant differences in supported configurations and functionality
in the JBoss A-MQ image compared to the regular release of JBoss A-MQ.
====

This topic details the differences between the JBoss A-MQ xPaaS image and the
regular release of JBoss A-MQ, and provides instructions specific to running and
configuring the JBoss A-MQ xPaaS image. Documentation for other JBoss A-MQ
functionality not specific to the JBoss A-MQ xPaaS image can be found in the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_A-MQ/[JBoss A-MQ
documentation on the Red Hat Customer Portal].

== Differences Between the JBoss A-MQ xPaaS Image and the Regular Release of JBoss A-MQ

There are several major functionality differences in the OpenShift JBoss A-MQ
xPaaS image:

* The Karaf shell is not available.
* The Fuse Management Console (Hawtio) is not available.
* Configuration of the broker can be performed:
** using parameters specified in the A-MQ application template, as described in
xref:configuring-params[Application Template Parameters].
** using the S2I (Source-to-image) tool, as described in
xref:configuring-sti[Configuration Using S2I].

== Using the JBoss A-MQ xPaaS Image Streams and Application Templates
The Red Hat xPaaS middleware images were
xref:../../install_config/imagestreams_templates.adoc#install-config-imagestreams-templates[automatically created during the installation]
of OpenShift along with the other default image streams and templates.

== Configuring the JBoss A-MQ Image

[[configuring-params]]
=== Application Template Parameters

Basic configuration of the JBoss A-MQ xPaaS image is performed by specifying
values of application template parameters. The following parameters can be
configured:

`*AMQ_RELEASE*`::
  The JBoss A-MQ release version. This determines which JBoss A-MQ image will be
  used as a basis for the application. At the moment, only version _6.2_ is
  available.
`*APPLICATION_NAME*`::
  The name of the application used internally in OpenShift. It is used in names
  of services, pods, and other objects within the application.
`*MQ_USERNAME*`::
  The user name used for authentication to the broker. In a standard
  non-containerized JBoss A-MQ, you would specify the user name in the
  *_AMQ_HOME/opt/user.properties_* file. If no value is specified, a random user
  name is generated.
`*MQ_PASSWORD*`::
  The password used for authentication to the broker. In a standard
  non-containerized JBoss A-MQ, you would specify the password in the
  *_AMQ_HOME/opt/user.properties_* file. If no value is specified, a random
  password is generated.
`*AMQ_ADMIN_USERNAME*`::
  The user name used as an admin authentication to the broker. If no value is specified, a random user name is generated.
`*AMQ_ADMIN_PASSWORD*`::
  The password used for authentication to the broker. If no value is specified, a random password is generated.
`*MQ_PROTOCOL*`::
  Comma-separated list of the messaging protocols used by the broker. Available
  options are _amqp_, _mqtt_, _openwire_, and _stomp_. If left empty, all
  available protocols will be available. Note that for integration of the
  image with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, the _openwire_
  protocol must be specified, while other protocols can be optionally specified
  as well.
`*MQ_QUEUES*`::
  Comma-separated list of queues available by default on the broker on its
  startup.
`*MQ_TOPICS*`::
  Comma-separated list of topics available by default on the broker on its
  startup.
`*AMQ_SECRET*`::
  The name of a secret containing SSL related files. If no value is specified, a random password is generated.
`*AMQ_TRUSTSTORE*`::
  The SSL trust store filename. If no value is specified, a random password is generated.
`*AMQ_KEYSTORE*`::
The SSL key store filename. If no value is specified, a random password is generated.

[[configuring-sti]]
=== Configuration Using S2I

Configuration of the JBoss A-MQ image can also be modified using the
Source-to-image feature, described in full detail at
xref:../../creating_images/s2i.adoc#creating-images-s2i[S2I Requirements].

Custom A-MQ broker configuration can be specified by creating an
*_openshift-activemq.xml_* file inside the *_git_* directory of your
application's Git project root. On each commit, the file will be copied to the
*_conf_* directory in the A-MQ root and its contents used to configure the
broker.

== Configuring the JBoss A-MQ Persistent Image

[[configuring-params-persistence]]
=== Application Template Parameters

Basic configuration of the JBoss A-MQ Persistent xPaaS image is performed by specifying
values of application template parameters. The following parameters can be
configured:

`*AMQ_RELEASE*`::
  The JBoss A-MQ release version. This determines which JBoss A-MQ image will be
  used as a basis for the application. At the moment, only version _6.2_ is
  available.
`*APPLICATION_NAME*`::
  The name of the application used internally in OpenShift. It is used in names
  of services, pods, and other objects within the application.
`*MQ_PROTOCOL*`::
  Comma-separated list of the messaging protocols used by the broker. Available
  options are _amqp_, _mqtt_, _openwire_, and _stomp_. If left empty, all
  available protocols will be available. Note that for integration of the
  image with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, the _openwire_
  protocol must be specified, while other protocols can be optionally specified
  as well.
`*MQ_QUEUES*`::
  Comma-separated list of queues available by default on the broker on its
  startup.
`*MQ_TOPICS*`::
  Comma-separated list of topics available by default on the broker on its
  startup.
`*VOLUME_CAPACITY*`::
  The size of the persistent storage for database volumes.
`*MQ_USERNAME*`::
  The user name used for authentication to the broker. In a standard
  non-containerized JBoss A-MQ, you would specify the user name in the
  *_AMQ_HOME/opt/user.properties_* file. If no value is specified, a random user
  name is generated.
`*MQ_PASSWORD*`::
  The password used for authentication to the broker. In a standard
  non-containerized JBoss A-MQ, you would specify the password in the
  *_AMQ_HOME/opt/user.properties_* file. If no value is specified, a random
  password is generated.
`*AMQ_ADMIN_USERNAME*`::
  The user name used as an admin authentication to the broker. If no value is specified, a random user name is generated.
`*AMQ_ADMIN_PASSWORD*`::
  The password used for authentication to the broker. If no value is specified, a random password is generated.
`*AMQ_SECRET*`::
  The name of a secret containing SSL related files. If no value is specified, a random password is generated.
`*AMQ_TRUSTSTORE*`::
  The SSL trust store filename. If no value is specified, a random password is generated.
`*AMQ_KEYSTORE*`::
  The SSL key store filename. If no value is specified, a random password is generated.

For more information, see
xref:../../dev_guide/persistent_volumes.adoc#dev-guide-persistent-volumes[Using Persistent Volumes].

== Security

Only SSL connections can connect from outside of the OpenShift instance,
regardless of the protocol specified in the `*MQ_PROTOCOL*` property of the A-MQ
application templates. The non-SSL version of the protocols can only be used
inside the OpenShift instance.

For security reasons, using the default KeyStore and TrustStore generated by the
system is discouraged. It is recommended to generate your own KeyStore and
TrustStore and supply them to the image using the OpenShift secrets mechanism or
S2I.

== High-Availability and Scalability

The JBoss xPaaS A-MQ image is supported in two modes:

1. A single A-MQ pod mapped to a Persistent Volume for message persistence. This mode provides message High Availability and guaranteed messaging but does not provide scalability.

2. Multiple A-MQ pods using local message persistence (i.e. no mapped Persistent Volume). This mode provides scalability but does not provide message High Availability or guaranteed messaging.

== Logging

In addition to viewing the OpenShift logs, you can troubleshoot a running JBoss
A-MQ image by viewing the JBoss A-MQ logs that are outputted to the container's
console:

----
$ oc logs -f <pod_name> <container_name>
----

[NOTE]
====
By default, the OpenShift JBoss A-MQ xPaaS image does not have a file log
handler configured. Logs are only sent to the console.
