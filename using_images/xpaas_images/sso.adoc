[IMPORTANT]
====
This image is currently in https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technical Preview] and not intended for production use.
====

== Overview

Red Hat Single Sign-On (SSO) is an integrated sign-on solution available as a containerized xPaaS image designed for use with OpenShift. This image provides an authentication server for users to centrally log in, log out, register, and manage user accounts for web applications, mobile applications, and RESTful web services.

Red Hat offers five SSO application templates:

* *_sso70-basic_*: SSO backed by a H2 database on the same pod
* *_sso70-mysql_*: SSO backed by a MySQL database on a separate pod
* *_sso70-mysql-persistent_*: SSO backed by a persistent PostgreSQL database on a separate pod
* *_sso70-postgresql_*: SSO backed by a MySQL database on a separate pod
* *_sso70-postgresql-persistent_*: SSO backed by a persistent PostgreSQL database on a separate pod

An SSO-enabled Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP) Image is also offered, which enables users to deploy a JBoss EAP instance that can be used with SSO for authentication:

* *_eap64-sso-s2i_*: SSO-enabled JBoss EAP

== Differences Between the SSO xPaaS Application and Keycloak
The SSO xPaaS application is based on Keycloak, a JBoss community project. There are some differences in functionality between the Red Hat Single Sign-On xPaaS Application and Keycloak:

* This image is currently available as a Technical Preview for use only with SSO-enabled Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP) applications.
* The SSO xPaaS Technical Preview Application includes all of the functionality of Keycloak 1.8.1. In addition, the SSO-enabled JBoss EAP image automatically handles OpenID Connect or SAML client registration and configuration for *_.war_* deployments that contain *<auth-method>KEYCLOAK</auth-method>* or *<auth-method>KEYCLOAK-SAML</auth-method>* in their respective *web.xml* files.

== Versioning for xPaaS Images
See the xPaaS part of the https://access.redhat.com/articles/2176281[OpenShift and Atomic Platform Tested Integrations page] for details about OpenShift image version compatibility.

== Prerequisites for Deploying the SSO xPaaS Image
The following is a list of prerequisites for using the SSO xPaaS image:

. *Acquire Red Hat Subscriptions*: Ensure that you have the relevant OpenShift subscriptions as well as a subscription for xPaaS Middleware.
. *Install OpenShift*: Before using the OpenShift xPaaS images, you must have an
OpenShift environment installed and configured. See the
xref:../../install/index.adoc#install-planning[Installing Clusters] guide for
steps on using Ansible to install in production environments.
. Ensure the *DNS* has been configured. This is required for communication between JBoss EAP and SSO, and for the requisite redirection. See xref:../../install/prerequisites.adoc#prereq-dns[DNS] for more information.
. *Install and Deploy Docker Registry*: Install the Docker Registry and then ensure that the Docker Registry is deployed to locally manage images:
+
----
$ oc adm registry --config=/etc/origin/master/admin.kubeconfig
----
+
For more information, see xref:../../install_config/registry/index.adoc#install-config-registry-overview[Deploying a Docker Registry]
. *Deploy a Router*. For more information, see xref:../../install_config/router/index.adoc#install-config-router-overview[Deploying a Router].
. Ensure that you can run the `oc create` command with xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[cluster-admin] privileges.

== Using the SSO Image Streams and Application Templates
The Red Hat xPaaS middleware images were
xref:../../install_config/imagestreams_templates.adoc#install-config-imagestreams-templates[automatically created during the installation]
of OpenShift along with the other default image streams and templates.

== Preparing and Deploying the SSO xPaaS Application Templates
=== Using the OpenShift CLI

. Prepare the JBoss EAP and SSO application service accounts and their associated secrets.
+
----
$ oc create -n <project-name> -f <application-templates_file_path>/secrets/eap-app-secret.json
----
+
----
$ oc create -n <project-name> -f <application-templates_file_path>/secrets/sso-app-secret.json
----
. Deploy one of the SSO application templates. This example deploys the *_sso70-postgresql_* template, which deploys an SSO pod backed by a PostgreSQL database on a separate pod.
+
----
$ oc process -f <application-templates_file_path>/sso/sso70-postgresql.json | oc create -n <project-name> -f -
----
+
Or, if the template has been imported into common namespace:
+
----
$ oc new-app --template=sso70-postgresql -n <project-name>
----

=== Using the OpenShift Web Console
Log in to the OpenShift web console:

. Click *Add to project* to list all of the default image streams and templates.
. Use the *Filter by keyword* search bar to limit the list to those that match _sso_. You may need to click *See all* to show the desired application template.
. Click an application template to list all of the deployment parameters. These parameters can be configured manually, or can be left as default.
. Click *Create* to deploy the application template.

=== Deployment Process
Once deployed, two pods will be created: one for the SSO web servers and one for the database. After the SSO web server pod has started, the web servers can be accessed at their custom configured hostnames, or at the default hostnames:

* _http://sso-<project-name>.<hostname>/auth_: for the web server, and
* _https://secure-sso-<project-name>.<hostname>/auth_: for the encrypted web server.

The default login username/password credentials are _admin_/_admin_.

== Quickstart Example: Using the SSO xPaaS Image with the SSO-enabled JBoss EAP xPaaS Image
This example uses the OpenShift web console to deploy SSO xPaaS backed by a PostgreSQL database. Once deployed, an SSO realm, role, and user will be created to be used when configuring the SSO-enabled JBoss EAP xPaaS Image deployment. Once successfully deployed, the SSO user can then be used to authenticate and access JBoss EAP.

=== Deploy the SSO Application Template

. Log in to the OpenShift web console and select the <project-name> project space.
. Click *Add to project* to list all of the default image streams and templates.
. Use the *Filter by keyword* search bar to limit the list to those that match _sso_. You may need to click *See all* to show the desired application template.
. Click the *_sso70-postgresql_* application template to list all of the deployment parameters. These parameters will be left as default for this example.
. Click *Create* to deploy the application template and start pod deployment. This may take a couple of minutes.

=== Create SSO Credentials
Log in to the encrypted SSO web server at _https://secure-sso-<project-name>.<hostname>/auth_ using the default _admin_/_admin_ user name and password.

* *Create a Realm*

. Create a new realm by hovering your cursor over the realm namespace (default is *Master*) at the top of the sidebar and click the *Add Realm* button.
. Enter a realm name and click *Create*.

* *Copy the Public Key*
In the newly created realm, click the *Keys* tab and copy the public key that has been generated. This will be needed to deploy the SSO-enabled JBoss EAP image.

* *Create a Role*
Create a role in SSO with a name that corresponds to the JEE role defined in the *web.xml* of the example application. This role will be assigned to an SSO _application user_ to authenticate access to user applications.

. Click *Roles* in the *Configure* sidebar to list the roles for this realm. As this is a new realm, there should only be the default _offline_access_ role. Click *Add Role*.
. Enter the role name and optional description and click *Save*.

* *Create Users and Assign Roles*
Create two users. The _realm management user_ will be assigned the *realm-management* roles to handle automatic SSO client registration in the SSO server. The _application user_ will be assigned the JEE role, created in the previous step, to authenticate access to user applications.

Create the _realm management user_:

. Click *Users* in the *Manage* sidebar to view the user information for the realm. Click *Add User*.
. Enter a valid *Username* and any additional optional information for the _realm management user_ and click *Save*.
. Edit the user configuration. Click the *Credentials* tab in the user space and enter a password for the user. After the password has been confirmed you can click the *Reset Password* button to set the user password. A pop-up window will prompt for additional confirmation.
. Click *Role Mappings* to list the realm and client role configuration. In the *Client Roles* drop-down menu, select *realm-management* and add all of the available roles to the user. This provides the user SSO server rights that can be used by the JBoSS EAP image to create clients.

Create the _application user_:

. Click *Users* in the *Manage* sidebar to view the user information for the realm. Click *Add User*.
. Enter a valid *Username* and any additional optional information for the _application user_ and click *Save*.
. Edit the user configuration. Click the *Credentials* tab in the user space and enter a password for the user. After the password has been confirmed you can click the *Reset Password* button to set the user password. A pop-up window will prompt for additional confirmation.
. Click *Role Mappings* to list the realm and client role configuration. In *Available Roles*, add the JEE role created earlier.

=== Deploy the SSO-enabled JBoss EAP Image

. Return to the OpenShift web console and click *Add to project* to list all of the default image streams and templates.
. Use the *Filter by keyword* search bar to limit the list to those that match _sso_. You may need to click *See all* to show the desired application template.
. Click the *_eap64-sso-s2i_* image to list all of the deployment parameters. Edit the configuration of the following SSO parameters:
+
* *SSO_URI*: The SSO web server authentication address: _https://secure-sso-<project-name>.<hostname>/auth_
* *SSO_REALM*: The SSO realm created for this procedure.
* *SSO_USERNAME*: The name of the _realm management user_.
* *SSO_PASSWORD*:  The password of the user.
* *SSO_PUBLIC_KEY*: The public key generated by the realm. It is located in the *Keys* tab of the *Realm Settings* in the SSO console.
* *SSO_BEARER_ONLY*: If set to *true*, the OpenID Connect client will be registered as bearer-only.
* *SSO_ENABLE_CORS*: If set to *true*, the Keycloak adapter enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
. Click *Create* to deploy the JBoss EAP image.

It may take several minutes for the JBoss EAP image to deploy. When it does, it can be accessed at:

* _$$http://<application-name>-<project-name>.<hostname>/<app-context>$$_: for the web server, and
* _$$https://secure-<application-name>-<project-name>.<hostname>/<app-context>$$_: for the encrypted web server, where <app-context> is one of app-jee, app-profile-jee, app-profile-jee-saml, or service depending on the example application.

==== Alternate Deployments
You can also create the client registration in the *Clients* frame of the *Configure* sidebar. Once a client has been registered, click the *Installation* tab and download the configuration *_.xml_*:

* For OpenID Connect application sources, save the *Keycloak OIDC JBoss Subsystem XML* to *_<file_path>/configuration/secure-deployments_*.
* For SAML application sources, save the *Keyclock SAML Wildfly/JBoss Subsystem* to *_<file_path>/configuration/secure-saml-deployments_*.

You can also edit the *_standalone-openshift.xml_* of the JBoss EAP image, which will deploy the manual configuration instead of the default. For more information, see xref:../../using_images/xpaas_images/eap.adoc#using-a-modified-jboss-eap-xpaas-image[Using a Modified JBoss EAP xPaaS Image].

=== Log in to the JBoss EAP Server Using SSO

. Access the JBoss EAP application server and click *Login*. You will be redirected to the SSO login.
. Log in using the SSO user created in the example. You will be authenticated against the SSO server and returned to the JBoss EAP application server.

== Known Issues

* There is a known issue with the EAP6 Adapter _HttpServletRequest.logout()_ in which the adapter does not log out from the application, which can create a login loop. The workaround is to call _HttpSession.invalidate();_ after _request.logout()_ to clear the Keycloak token from the session. For more information, see https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-2665[KEYCLOAK-2665].
* The SSO logs throw a duplication error if the SSO pod is restarted while backed by a database pod. This error can be safely ignored.
* Setting _adminUrl_ to a "https://..." address in an OpenID Connect client will cause *javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException* exceptions on the SSO server if the default secrets (*sso-app-secret* and *eap-app-secret*) are used. The application server must use either CA-signed certificates or configure the SSO trust store to trust the self-signed certificates.
* If the client route uses a different domain suffix to the SSO service, the client registration script will erroneously configure the client on the SSO side, causing bad redirection.
* The SSO-enabled JBoss EAP image does not properly set the *adminUrl* property during automatic client registration. As a workaround, log in to the SSO console after the application has started and manually modify the client registration *adminUrl* property to *$$http://<application-name>-<project-name>.<hostname>/<app-context>$$*.
