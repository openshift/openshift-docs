== Overview
Red Hat JBoss Fuse Integration Services is a containerized xPaaS image that is designed for use with OpenShift. It allows developers to quickly deploy applications in a hybrid cloud environment. In Fuse Integration Services application runtime is dynamic. 

[IMPORTANT]
There are significant differences in supported configurations and functionality in the Fuse Integration Services compared to the standalone JBoss Fuse product. 

=== Differences Between the Fuse Integration Services and the JBoss Fuse Standalone release
There are several major functionality differences:

* The Karaf shell is not available.
* Administration views are available through OpenShift Console with Hawtio plugin. 
* All applications are packaged as Docker images for OpenShift.
* Kubernetes REST API is used to orchestrate the containers.

 

== Using Fuse Integration Services 
You can start using Fuse Integration Services by creating application and deploying it to OpenShift. There are two main ways to create an application in Fuse Integration Services:

* Using Maven Archetypes 
* Using Application Templates 

=== Using Maven Archetypes
Creates a new project based off a Maven application template created through Archetype catalog. This catalog provides examples
of Java and Karaf projects and supports s2i and local image build workflows. 

==== Maven Archetypes Catalog:
The Maven Archetype catalog has is pre-built with following examples: 

|=== 

| cdi-camel-http-archetype | Creates a new Camel route using CDI in a standalone Java Container calling the remote camel-servlet quickstart

| cdi-cxf-archetype | Creates a new CXF JAX-RS using CDI running in a standalone Java Container

| cdi-camel-archetype | Creates a new Camel route using CDI in a standalone Java Container

| cdi-camel-jetty-archetype | Creates a new Camel route using CDI in a standalone Java Container using Jetty as HTTP server

| java-simple-mainclass-archetype | Creates a new Simple standalone Java Container (main class) 

| java-camel-spring-archetype | Creates a new Camel route using Spring XML in a standalone Java container

| karaf-cxf-rest-archetype | Creates a new RESTful WebService Example using JAX-RS

| karaf-camel-rest-sql-archetype | Creates a new Camel Example using Rest DSL with SQL Database

| karaf-camel-log-archetype | Creates a new Camel Log Example

|=== 

You can select the the example that can best serve your purpose to create an application. 

==== Simple Workflow to create an application from Maven Archetype Catalog: 

. Use Maven archetype catalog to create a sample project with the required resources. For example, following command will create a sample project: 
+
----
$ mvn archetype:generate -Darchetype-catalog=http://origin-repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/ea/io/fabric8/archetypes/archetypes-catalog/2.2.0.redhat-054/archetypes-catalog-2.2.0.redhat-054-archetype-catalog.xml 
----

. This will create a maven project with necessary dependencies. Maven properties and plugins that are used to create Docker images are added to the pom.xml. 

+

* Maven docker variables
+
|=== 

| dockerHost (docker.host) | Use this variable to specify the URL that your Docker Daemon is listening to. If this option is not set, DOCKER_HOST environment variable will be evaluated. If this is also not set, the plugin will use unix:///var/run/docker.sock as a default. 

| apiVersion (docker.apiVersion) | Use this variable if you are using older version of docker not compatible with the current version.

| image (docker.image) | Use this variable to restrict the operation of maven plugin goals. The value can be a single image name (either its alias or full name) or it can be a comma separated list with multiple image names. 

| registry (docker.registry) | Use this variable to specify globally a registry to use for pulling and pushing images.

| sourceDirectory (docker.source.dir) | Use this variable to specify the default directory that contains the assembly descriptors used by the plugin. The default value is src/main/docker. This option is only relevant for the docker:build goal.

| outputDirectory (docker.target.dir) | Use this variable to specify the default output directory to be used by the plugin. The default value is target/docker and is only used for the goal docker:build. 

|=== 

. Build and push the project to OpenShift. There are maven goals that you can used for building and pushing docker images. 

+
|=== 

| docker:build | Builds the docker image for your maven project. 

| docker:push | Pushes the locally built docker image to the global or a local docker registry. 

| fabric8:json | Generates kubernetes json file for your maven project. 

| fabric8:apply | Applies the kubernetes json file to the current Kubernetes environment and namespace. 

|=== 
+

There are few pre-configured maven profiles that you can use to build the project. These are:

+
|=== 

| mvn -Pf8-build | Comprises of docker:build and fabric8:json. This will build dockerfile and json image for a project.

| mvn -Pf8-local-deploy | Comprises of docker:build, fabric8:json, and fabric8:apply. This will create docker and json images and then apply them to OpenShift. 

| mvn -Pf8-deploy: | Comprises of docker:build, fabric8:json, docker:push, and fabric8:apply. This will create docker and json images, push them to docker registry and apply to OpenShift. 

|=== 
+
In this example, we will build it locally by running the command: 
+
----
$ mvn -Pf8-local-deploy 
----
. Open OpenShift Admin console. A pod is created for the newly created application. You can view the status of this pod, deployments and services that the application is creating. 

=== Using Application Templates 
Application are created through OpenShift Admin Console and CLI using application templates. Application source is pulled from remote Git repository and built using source-to-image (s2i) method. You can configure the application with customized application parameters.
