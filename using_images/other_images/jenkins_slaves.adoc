[[overview]]
== Overview
{product-title} provides three images suitable for use as Jenkins agents: the
*_Base_*, *_Maven_*, and *_Node.js_* images.

[NOTE]
====
The jenkins-slave-maven-* and jenkins-slave-nodejs-* images are being
marked as deprecated during the v3.10 release cycle. The images still
exist in the interim so users can migrate their applications to the newer
jenkins-agent-maven-* and jenkins-agent-nodejs-* images.
====

The first is a link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/slave-base[base image] for Jenkins agents:

 - It pulls in both the required tools (headless Java, the Jenkins JNLP client)
   and the useful ones (including git, tar, zip, and nss among others).
 - It establishes the JNLP agent as the entrypoint.
 - It includes the `oc` client tooling for invoking command line operations from
   within Jenkins jobs.
 - It provides Dockerfiles for both CentOS and RHEL images.

Four additional images that extend the base image are also provided:

* link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/slave-maven[original Maven image deprecated as part of v3.10]
* link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/slave-nodejs[original Node.js image deprecated as part of v3.10]
* link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/agent-maven-3.5[new Maven v3.5 image introduced in v3.10]
* link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/agent-nodejs-8[new Node.js v8 image introduced in v3.10]

The Maven and Node.js Jenkins agent images provide Dockerfiles for both CentOS
and RHEL that you can reference when building new agent images. Also note the
`contrib` and `contrib/bin` subdirectories. They allow for the insertion of
configuration files and executable scripts for your image.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use and extend an appropriate agent image version for the version
of {product-title} that you are using. If the `oc` client version embedded in
the agent image is not compatible with the {product-title} version, unexpected
behavior may result.

[[configuration-and-customization]]
== Configuration and Customization

[[environment-variables]]
=== Environment Variables

Each Jenkins agent container can be configured with the following environment
variables:

* `OPENSHIFT_JENKINS_JVM_ARCH`
+
Set to `x86_64` or `i386` to override the JVM used to host the Jenkins agent.
For memory efficiency, by default the Jenkins agent images dynamically
use a 32-bit JVM if running in a container with a memory limit under 2GiB.

* `JAVA_MAX_HEAP_PARAM` +
`CONTAINER_HEAP_PERCENT` (default: `0.5`, i.e. 50%) +
`JNLP_MAX_HEAP_UPPER_BOUND_MB` +
+
These values control the maximum heap size of the Jenkins agent JVM. If
`JAVA_MAX_HEAP_PARAM` is set (example setting: `-Xmx512m`), its value takes
precedence. Otherwise, the maximum heap size is dynamically calculated as
`CONTAINER_HEAP_PERCENT`% (example setting: `0.5`, i.e. 50%) of the container
memory limit, optionally capped at `JNLP_MAX_HEAP_UPPER_BOUND_MB` MiB (example
setting: `512`).
+
By default, the maximum heap size of the Jenkins agent JVM is set to 50%
of the container memory limit with no cap.

* `JAVA_INITIAL_HEAP_PARAM` +
`CONTAINER_INITIAL_PERCENT`
+
These values control the initial heap size of the Jenkins agent JVM. If
`JAVA_INITIAL_HEAP_PARAM` is set (example setting: `-Xms32m`), its value takes
precedence. Otherwise, the initial heap size may be dynamically calculated as
`CONTAINER_INITIAL_PERCENT`% (example setting: `0.1`, i.e. 10%) of the
dynamically calculated maximum heap size.
+
By default, the initial heap sizing is left to the JVM.

* `CONTAINER_CORE_LIMIT`
+
If set, specifies an integer number of cores used for sizing numbers of internal
JVM threads. Example setting: `2`.

* `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` (default: `-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap -Dsun.zip.disableMemoryMapping=true`)
+
Specifies options to be heeded by all JVMs running in this container. It is not
recommended to override this.

* `JAVA_GC_OPTS` (default: `-XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=5 -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=10 -XX:GCTimeRatio=4 -XX:AdaptiveSizePolicyWeight=90`)
+
Specifies Jenkins agent JVM garbage collection parameters. It is not
recommended to override this.

* `JNLP_JAVA_OVERRIDES`
+
Specifies additional options for the Jenkins agent JVM. These options are
appended to all other options, including the Java options above, and may be used
to override any of them if necessary. Separate each additional option with a
space; if any option contains space characters, escape them with a backslash.
Example settings: `-Dfoo -Dbar`; `-Dfoo=first\ value -Dbar=second\ value`.

[[usage]]
== Usage

[[memory-slaves-requirements]]
=== Memory Requirements

A JVM is used in all Jenkins agents to host the Jenkins JNLP agent, as well as
to run any Java applications (e.g. `javac`, Maven or Gradle). See
xref:../../dev_guide/application_memory_sizing.adoc#sizing-openjdk[Sizing
OpenJDK on {product-title}] for background information on tuning the JVM used by Jenkins
agents.

For memory efficiency, by default the Jenkins image dynamically uses a 32-bit
JVM if running in a container with a memory limit under 2GiB. This behavior can
be overridden by the `OPENSHIFT_JENKINS_JVM_ARCH` environment variable. The
JVM choice applies by default both for the Jenkins JNLP agent as well as for any
other Java processes within the agent container.

By default the Jenkins JNLP agent JVM uses 50% of the container memory limit for
its heap. This value can be modified by the `CONTAINER_HEAP_PERCENT`
environment variable. It can also be capped at an upper limit or overridden
entirely. See xref:#environment-variables[Environment Variables] for
more details.

Consider that by default any/all other processes executed in the Jenkins
agent container, e.g. shell scripts or `oc` commands run from pipelines, may not
be able to use more than the remaining 50% memory limit without provoking an OOM
kill.

By default, each further JVM process run in a Jenkins agent container uses
up to 25% of the container memory limit for their heap. It may be necessary to
tune this for many build workloads. See
xref:../../dev_guide/application_memory_sizing.adoc#sizing-openjdk[Sizing
OpenJDK on {product-title}] for more information.

See xref:jenkins.adoc#memory-requirements[the Jenkins documentation] for
information on specifying the memory request and limit of a Jenkins agent
container.

[[gradle-builds]]
==== Gradle builds

Hosting Gradle builds in the a Jenkins agent on OpenShift presents additional
complications, not least because in addition to the Jenkins JNLP agent and
Gradle JVMs, Gradle spawns a third JVM to run tests, if these are specified.

See
xref:../../dev_guide/application_memory_sizing.adoc#sizing-openjdk[Sizing
OpenJDK on {product-title}] for background information on tuning JVMs on OpenShift.

The following settings are suggested as a starting point for running Gradle
builds in a memory constrained Jenkins agent on OpenShift. Settings may be
relaxed subsequently as required.

* Ensure the long-lived gradle daemon is disabled by adding
`org.gradle.daemon=false` to the gradle.properties file.
* Disable parallel build execution by ensuring `org.gradle.parallel=true` is not
set in the gradle.properties file and that `--parallel` is not set as a command
line argument.
* Set `java { options.fork = false }` in the build.gradle file to prevent
Java compilations running out-of-process.
* Disable multiple additional test processes by ensuring
`test { maxParallelForks = 1 }` is set in the build.gradle file.
* Override the gradle JVM memory parameters according to
xref:../../dev_guide/application_memory_sizing.adoc#sizing-openjdk[Sizing
OpenJDK on {product-title}] by the GRADLE_OPTS, JAVA_OPTS or JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS environment
variables.
* Set the maximum heap size and JVM arguments for any Gradle test JVM by
the maxHeapSize and jvmArgs settings in build.gradle, or though the
`-Dorg.gradle.jvmargs` command line argument.
