If you want to use container images not found in the
link:https://access.redhat.com/containers/[Red Hat Container Catalog], you can
use other arbitrary container images in your {product-title} instance, for
example those found on the https://registry.hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub].

For {product-title}-specific guidelines on running containers using an
arbitrarily assigned user ID, see
xref:../../creating_images/guidelines.adoc#use-uid[Support Arbitrary User IDs]
in the Creating Images guide.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} runs containers using an arbitrarily assigned user ID. This
behavior provides additional security against processes escaping the container
due to a container engine vulnerability and thereby achieving escalated
permissions on the host node. Due to this restriction, images that run as root
will not deploy as expected on {product-title}.
