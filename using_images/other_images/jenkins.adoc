== Overview
OpenShift provides a Docker image for running Jenkins.  This image provides a Jenkins server instance which can be used to set up a basic flow for continuous testing, integration, and delivery.

This image also includes a sample Jenkins job which triggers a new build of a `*BuildConfig*` defined in OpenShift, tests the output of that build, and then on successful build, retags the output to indicate the build is ready for production.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift provides version
https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/1[1.609] of Jenkins.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-1-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/jenkins-1-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these registries or push them into your OpenShift Docker registry.
Additionally, you can create an ImageStream that points to the image, either in your Docker registry or at the external location.
Your OpenShift resources can then reference the ImageStream.
You can find https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example] ImageStream definitions for all the provided OpenShift images.

== Configuration and Usage

=== Initializing Jenkins

The first time you start Jenkins, the configuration is created along with the administrator user and password.
The default login is `*admin/password*`.
The default password can be configured by setting the `*JENKINS_PASSWORD*` environment variable.

The following command creates a new Jenkins link:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#pods[pod] with Jenkins running in a container:

----
$ oc new-app -e \
    JENKINS_PASSWORD=<password> \
    openshift/jenkins-1-centos7
----

=== Environment Variables

The Jenkins password can be configured with the following environment variable:

.Jenkins Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*JENKINS_PASSWORD*`
|Password for the `*admin*` user.

|===


=== Volume Mount Points
The Jenkins image can be run with mounted volumes to enable persistent storage for the configuration:

* *_/var/lib/jenkins_* - This is the data directory where Jenkins stores configuration files including job definitions.

== Creating a Jenkins Service from a Template

link:../../dev_guide/templates.html[Templates] provide parameter fields to define all the environment variables (password) with predefined defaults.
OpenShift provides templates to make creating a new Jenkins service easy.
The Jenkins templates should have been registered in the default `openshift` project by your cluster administrator during the link:../../install_config/install/first_steps.html[First Steps] setup process.
The two available templates both define a link:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment configuration] and a link:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services[service], but differ in their storage strategy, which affects whether or not the Jenkins content persists across a pod restart.

[NOTE]
====
A pod may be restarted when it is moved to another node, or when an update of the deployment configuration triggers a redeployment.
====

* `jenkins-ephemeral` uses ephemeral storage.
On pod restart, all data is lost.
This template is useful for development or testing only.

* `jenkins-persistent` uses a persistent volume store.
Data survives a pod restart.
To use a persistent volume store, the cluster administrator must define a link:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_nfs.html[persistent volume pool] in the OpenShift deployment.

Once selected, you must link:../../dev_guide/templates.html#creating-resources-from-a-template[instantiate] the template to be able to use Jenkins.

== OpenShift Pipeline Plugin

The Jenkins image's list of pre-installed plugins includes a plugin which assists in the creating of CI/CD workflows that run against
an OpenShift server.  A series of build steps, post-build actions, as well as SCM-style polling are provided which equate to administrative
and operational actions on the OpenShift server and the API artifacts hosted there.

The https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/1/contrib/openshift/configuration/jobs/OpenShift%20Sample[sample Jenkins job] that is pre-configured in the Jenkins image utilizes the OpenShift pipeline plugin and serves as an example of
how to leverage the plugin for creating CI/CD flows for OpenShift in Jenkins.

See the https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-plugin/[the plugin's README] for a detailed description of what is available.
