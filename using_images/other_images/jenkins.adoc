== Overview
OpenShift provides a Docker image for running Jenkins.  This image provides a Jenkins server instance which can be used to set up a basic flow for continuous testing, integration, and delivery.

This image also includes a sample Jenkins job which triggers a new build of a `*BuildConfig*` defined in OpenShift, tests the output of that build, and then on successful build, retags the output to indicate the build is ready for production.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift provides version
https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/1[1.609] of Jenkins.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-1-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/jenkins-1-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these registries or push them into your OpenShift Docker registry.
Additionally, you can create an ImageStream that points to the image, either in your Docker registry or at the external location.
Your OpenShift resources can then reference the ImageStream.
You can find https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example] ImageStream definitions for all the provided OpenShift images.

== Configuration and Usage

=== Initializing Jenkins

The first time you start Jenkins, the configuration is created along with the administrator user and password.
The default login is `*admin/password*`.
The default password can be configured by setting the `*JENKINS_PASSWORD*` environment variable.

The following command creates a new Jenkins link:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#pods[pod] with Jenkins running in a container:

----
$ oc new-app -e \
    JENKINS_PASSWORD=<password> \
    openshift/jenkins-1-centos7
----

=== Environment Variables

The Jenkins password can be configured with the following environment variable:

.Jenkins Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*JENKINS_PASSWORD*`
|Password for the `*admin*` user.

|===


=== Volume Mount Points
The Jenkins image can be run with mounted volumes to enable persistent storage for the configuration:

* *_/var/lib/jenkins_* - This is the data directory where Jenkins stores configuration files including job definitions.

== Creating a Jenkins Service from a Template

link:../../dev_guide/templates.html[Templates] provide parameter fields to
define all the environment variables (password) with predefined defaults.
OpenShift provides templates to make creating a new Jenkins service easy. The
Jenkins templates should have been registered in the default *openshift* project
by your cluster administrator during the initial cluster setup.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
See link:../../install_config/install/first_steps.html[First Steps] for more
details, if required.
endif::[]

The two available templates both define a
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configuration] and a
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services[service],
but differ in their storage strategy, which affects whether or not the Jenkins
content persists across a pod restart.

[NOTE]
====
A pod may be restarted when it is moved to another node, or when an update of the deployment configuration triggers a redeployment.
====

* `jenkins-ephemeral` uses ephemeral storage. On pod restart, all data is lost.
This template is useful for development or testing only.

* `jenkins-persistent` uses a persistent volume store. Data survives a pod
restart. To use a persistent volume store, the cluster administrator must
define a persistent volume pool in the OpenShift deployment.

Once selected, you must link:../../dev_guide/templates.html#creating-resources-from-a-template[instantiate] the template to be able to use Jenkins.

[[jenkins-as-s2i-builder]]
== Using Jenkins as a Source-To-Image builder

To customize the official OpenShift Jenkins image, you have two options:

* Use Docker layering.
* Use the image as a Source-To-Image builder, described here.

You can use link:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[S2I]
to copy your custom Jenkins Jobs definitions, additional
plug-ins or replace the provided *_config.xml_* file with your own, custom, configuration.

In order to include your modifications in the Jenkins image, you need to have a Git
repository with the following directory structure:

*_plugins_*::
This directory contains those binary Jenkins plug-ins you want to copy into Jenkins.

*_plugins.txt_*::
This file lists the plug-ins you want to install (see the section above).

*_configuration/jobs_*::
This directory contains the Jenkins job definitions.

*_configuration/config.xml_*::
This file contains your custom Jenkins configuration.

The contents of the *_configuration/_* directory will be copied
into the *_/var/lib/jenkins/_* directory, so you can also include
additional files, such as *_credentials.xml_*, there.

The following is an example build configuration that customizes the Jenkins
image in OpenShift:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
  name: custom-jenkins-build
spec:
  source:                       <1>
    git:
      uri: https://github.com/custom/repository
    type: Git
  strategy:                     <2>
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: jenkins:latest
        namespace: openshift
    type: Source
  output:                       <3>
    to:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: custom-jenkins:latest
----

<1> The `source` field defines the source Git repository
with the layout described above.
<2> The `strategy` field defines the original Jenkins image to use
as a source image for the build.
<3> The `output` field defines the resulting, customized Jenkins image
you can use in deployment configuration instead of the official Jenkins image.

[[using-the-jenkins-kubernetes-plug-in-to-run-jobs]]
== Using the Jenkins Kubernetes Plug-in to Run Jobs

The official OpenShift Jenkins image includes the pre-installed
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin[Kubernetes
plug-in] that allows Jenkins slaves to be dynamically provisioned on multiple
Docker hosts using Kubernetes and OpenShift.

The Jenkins image entrypoint also provides auto-discovery and auto-configuration
of the Kubernetes plug-ins by scanning the project Jenkins is deployed in for
existing image streams with the label *role* set to *jenkins-slave*.

When an image stream with this label is found, the entrypoint generates the
corresponding Kubernetes plug-in configuration so you can assign your Jenkins
jobs to run in a pod running the Docker image provided by the image stream.

To use a Docker image as an Jenkins slave, the image must run the slave agent as
an entrypoint. For more details about this, refer to the official
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds#Distributedbuilds-Launchslaveagentheadlessly[Jenkins
documentation].

Alternatively, you can use
https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins-master/jenkins-slave-template.json[a
provided OpenShift template] to convert an existing image stream to a Jenkins
slave.

== Tutorial

For more details on the sample job included in this image, see this link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/README.md[tutorial].

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
== OpenShift Pipeline Plug-in

The Jenkins image's list of pre-installed plug-ins includes a plug-in which assists in the creating of CI/CD workflows that run against
an OpenShift server.  A series of build steps, post-build actions, as well as SCM-style polling are provided which equate to administrative
and operational actions on the OpenShift server and the API artifacts hosted there.

In addition to being accessible from the classic "freestyle" form of Jenkins job, the build steps as of version 1.0.14 of the OpenShift Pipeline Plug-in
are also avaible to Jenkins Pipeline jobs via the DSL extension points provided by the Jenkins Pipeline Plug-in.

The https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/1/contrib/openshift/configuration/jobs/OpenShift%20Sample[sample Jenkins job] that is pre-configured in the Jenkins image utilizes the OpenShift pipeline plug-in and serves as an example of
how to leverage the plug-in for creating CI/CD flows for OpenShift in Jenkins.

See the https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-plugin/[the plug-in's README] for a detailed description of what is available.
