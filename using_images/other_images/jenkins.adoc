== Overview
{product-title} provides a container image for running Jenkins. This image provides a Jenkins server instance, which can be used to set up a basic flow for continuous testing, integration, and delivery.

This image also includes a sample Jenkins job, which triggers a new build of a `*BuildConfig*` defined in {product-title}, tests the output of that build, and then on successful build, retags the output to indicate the build is ready for production.

[[jenkins-version]]
== Versions

{product-title} follows the https://jenkins.io/changelog-stable/[LTS] releases of Jenkins.

[[jenkins-images]]
== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-1-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/jenkins-1-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these registries or push them into your {product-title} Docker registry.
Additionally, you can create an ImageStream that points to the image, either in your Docker registry or at the external location.
Your {product-title} resources can then reference the ImageStream.
You can find https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example] ImageStream definitions for all the provided {product-title} images.

[[jenkins-configuration-and-usage]]
== Configuration and Usage

[[jenkins-initializing-jenkins]]
=== Initializing Jenkins

You can manage Jenkins authentication in two ways:

* {product-title} OAuth authentication provided by the OpenShift Login plug-in.

* Standard authentication provided by Jenkins

[[jenkins-openshift-oauth-authentication]]
==== {product-title} OAuth authentication

xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.adoc#oauth[OAuth
authentication] is activated by configuring the `*Configure Global Security*`
panel in the Jenkins UI, or by setting the `*OPENSHIFT_ENABLE_OAUTH*`
environment variable on the Jenkins `*Deployment Config*` to anything other than
`false`. This activates the OpenShift Login plug-in, which retrieves the
configuration information from pod data or by interacting with the
{product-title} API server.

Valid user and password combinations are controlled by your identity provider.
For example, if `Allow All` is the default identity provider, you can provide
any non-empty string for both the user name and password. If you have
administrator privileges in the project Jenkins is running in, you will have
administrative privileges within Jenkins.

Valid users are automatically added to the Jenkins authorization matrix at log
in, dictated by the permissions within the Jenkins authorization matrix
associated with the user. Users authenticated against {product-title} OAuth are
added to the Jenkins authorization matrix on their first successful log in.

The `admin` role maps to the set of permissions traditionally associated with
the `admin` user in the {product-title} Jenkins image:

* hudson.model.Computer.Configure
* hudson.model.Computer.Delete
* hudson.model.Hudson.Administer
* hudson.model.Hudson.Read
* hudson.model.Item.Build
* hudson.model.Item.Configure
* hudson.model.Item.Create
* hudson.model.Item.Delete
* hudson.model.Item.Read
* hudson.model.Item.Workspace
* hudson.model.Run.Delete
* hudson.model.Run.Update
* hudson.model.View.Configure
* hudson.model.View.Create
* hudson.model.View.Delete
* hudson.scm.SCM.Tag

Users with the `edit` or `view` roles for the {product-title} project have progressively reduced permissions within Jenkins.

For the `view` role:

* hudson.model.Hudson.Read
* hudson.model.Item.Read

For the `edit` role, in addition to the permissions available to `*view*`:

* hudson.model.Item.Build
* hudson.model.Item.Configure
* hudson.model.Item.Create
* hudson.model.Item.Delete
* hudson.model.Item.Workspace
* hudson.scm.SCM.Tag


[NOTE]
====
The `admin` user that is pre-populated in the {product-title} Jenkins image with
administrative privileges will not be given those privileges when
{product-title} OAuth is used, unless the {product-title} cluster administrator
explicitly defines that user in the {product-title} identity provider and
assigns the `admin` role to the user.
====

Jenkins' users permissions can be changed after the users are initially
established. The OpenShift Login plug-in polls the {product-title} API server
for permissions and updates the permissions stored in Jenkins for each user with
the permissions retrieved from {product-title}. If the Jenkins UI is used to
update permissions for a Jenkins user, the permission changes are overwritten
the next time the plug-in polls {product-title}.

You can control how often the polling occurs with the
`OPENSHIFT_PERMISSIONS_POLL_INTERVAL` environment variable. The default polling
interval is five minutes.

.Creating a new Jenkins pod

. Ensure you have installed
xref:../../install_config/imagestreams_templates.adoc[the default imagestreams
and templates].

. Then create a new Jenkins application using:
.. Persistent volumes:
----
$ oc new-app jenkins-persistent
----

.. Or an EmptyDir type volume (where configuration does not persist across pod restarts):
----
$ oc new-app jenkins-ephemeral
----

[NOTE]
====
If you instantiate the template against releases prior to v3.4 of
{product-title}, standard Jenkins authentication is used, and the default
'admin' account will exist with password 'password'. See
xref:../../using_images/other_images/jenkins.adoc#jenkins-jenkins-standard-authentication[Jenkins
Standard Authentication] for details about changing this password.
====

[[jenkins-jenkins-standard-authentication]]
==== Jenkins Standard Authentication

Jenkins authentication is used by default if the image is run outside of
{product-title}.

The first time Jenkins starts, the configuration is created along with the
administrator user and password. The default user credentials are `*admin*` and
`*password*`. Configure the default password by setting the `*JENKINS_PASSWORD*`
environment variable when using (and only when using) standard Jenkins
authentication.

To create a new Jenkins application using standard Jenkins authentication:

----
$ oc new-app -e \
    JENKINS_PASSWORD=<password> \
    openshift/jenkins-1-centos7
----

[[jenkins-environment-variables]]
=== Environment Variables

The Jenkins server can be configured with the following environment variables:

.Jenkins Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*JENKINS_PASSWORD*`
|The password for the `*admin*` user when using standard Jenkins authentication.  Not applicable when using {product-title} OAuth authentication.

|`*OPENSHIFT_ENABLE_OAUTH*`
|Determines whether the OpenShift Login plug-in manages authentication when logging into Jenkins. Enabled when set to any non-empty value other than "false".

|`*OPENSHIFT_PERMISSIONS_POLL_INTERVAL*`
|Specifies in seconds how often the OpenShift Login plug-in polls {product-title} for the permissions associated with each user defined in Jenkins.

|===

[[jenkins-cross-project-access]]
=== Cross Project Access

If you are going to run Jenkins somewhere other than as a deployment within your same project, you will need to provide an access token to Jenkins to access your project.

. Identify the secret for the service account that has appropriate permissions
to access the project Jenkins needs to access:
+
----
$ oc describe serviceaccount default
Name:       default
Labels:     <none>
Secrets:    {  default-token-uyswp    }
            {  default-dockercfg-xcr3d    }
Tokens:     default-token-izv1u
            default-token-uyswp
----
+
In this case the secret is named `default-token-uyswp`

. Retrieve the token from the secret:
+
----
$ oc describe secret <secret name from above> # e.g. default-token-izv1u
Name:       default-token-izv1u
Labels:     <none>
Annotations:    kubernetes.io/service-account.name=default,kubernetes.io/service-account.uid=32f5b661-2a8f-11e5-9528-3c970e3bf0b7
Type:   kubernetes.io/service-account-token
Data
====
ca.crt: 1066 bytes
token:  eyJhbGc..<content cut>....wRA
----

The token field contains the token value Jenkins needs to access the project.

[[jenkins-volume-mount-points]]
=== Volume Mount Points
The Jenkins image can be run with mounted volumes to enable persistent storage for the configuration:

* *_/var/lib/jenkins_* - This is the data directory where Jenkins stores configuration files including job definitions.

[[jenkins-creating-jenkins-service-from-template]]
== Creating a Jenkins Service from a Template

xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[Templates] provide parameter fields to
define all the environment variables (password) with predefined defaults.
{product-title} provides templates to make creating a new Jenkins service easy. The
Jenkins templates should have been registered in the default *openshift* project
by your cluster administrator during the initial cluster setup.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
See xref:../../install_config/imagestreams_templates.adoc#install-config-imagestreams-templates[Loading the Default Image Streams and Templates]
for more details, if required.
endif::[]

The two available templates both define a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configuration] and a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[service],
but differ in their storage strategy, which affects whether or not the Jenkins
content persists across a pod restart.

[NOTE]
====
A pod may be restarted when it is moved to another node, or when an update of the deployment configuration triggers a redeployment.
====

* `jenkins-ephemeral` uses ephemeral storage. On pod restart, all data is lost.
This template is useful for development or testing only.

* `jenkins-persistent` uses a persistent volume store. Data survives a pod
restart. To use a persistent volume store, the cluster administrator must
define a persistent volume pool in the {product-title} deployment.

Once selected, you must xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[instantiate] the template to be able to use Jenkins.

[[jenkins-as-s2i-builder]]
== Using Jenkins as a Source-To-Image builder

To customize the official {product-title} Jenkins image, you have two options:

* Use Docker layering.
* Use the image as a Source-To-Image builder, described here.

You can use xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#source-build[S2I]
to copy your custom Jenkins Jobs definitions, additional
plug-ins or replace the provided *_config.xml_* file with your own, custom, configuration.

In order to include your modifications in the Jenkins image, you need to have a Git
repository with the following directory structure:

*_plugins_*::
This directory contains those binary Jenkins plug-ins you want to copy into Jenkins.

*_plugins.txt_*::
This file lists the plug-ins you want to install:

----
pluginId:pluginVersion
----

*_configuration/jobs_*::
This directory contains the Jenkins job definitions.

*_configuration/config.xml_*::
This file contains your custom Jenkins configuration.

The contents of the *_configuration/_* directory will be copied
into the *_/var/lib/jenkins/_* directory, so you can also include
additional files, such as *_credentials.xml_*, there.

The following is an example build configuration that customizes the Jenkins
image in {product-title}:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
  name: custom-jenkins-build
spec:
  source:                       <1>
    git:
      uri: https://github.com/custom/repository
    type: Git
  strategy:                     <2>
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: jenkins:latest
        namespace: openshift
    type: Source
  output:                       <3>
    to:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: custom-jenkins:latest
----

<1> The `source` field defines the source Git repository
with the layout described above.
<2> The `strategy` field defines the original Jenkins image to use
as a source image for the build.
<3> The `output` field defines the resulting, customized Jenkins image
you can use in deployment configuration instead of the official Jenkins image.

[[using-the-jenkins-kubernetes-plug-in-to-run-jobs]]
== Using the Jenkins Kubernetes Plug-in to Run Jobs

The official {product-title} Jenkins image includes the pre-installed
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin[Kubernetes
plug-in] that allows Jenkins slaves to be dynamically provisioned on multiple
container hosts using Kubernetes and {product-title}.

The Jenkins image entrypoint also provides auto-discovery and auto-configuration
of the Kubernetes plug-ins by scanning the project Jenkins is deployed in for
existing image streams with the label *role* set to *jenkins-slave*.

When an image stream with this label is found, the entrypoint generates the
corresponding Kubernetes plug-in configuration so you can assign your Jenkins
jobs to run in a pod running the container image provided by the image stream.

To use a container image as an Jenkins slave, the image must run the slave agent as
an entrypoint. For more details about this, refer to the official
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds#Distributedbuilds-Launchslaveagentheadlessly[Jenkins
documentation].

== Tutorial

For more details on the sample job included in this image, see this link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/README.md[tutorial].

== {product-title} Pipeline Plug-in

The Jenkins image's list of pre-installed plug-ins includes a plug-in which
assists in the creating of CI/CD workflows that run against an {product-title}
server.  A series of build steps, post-build actions, as well as SCM-style
polling are provided which equate to administrative and operational actions on
the {product-title} server and the API artifacts hosted there.

In addition to being accessible from the classic "freestyle" form of Jenkins
job, the build steps as of version 1.0.14 of the {product-title} Pipeline
Plug-in are also avaible to Jenkins Pipeline jobs via the DSL extension points
provided by the Jenkins Pipeline Plug-in.

The
https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/1/contrib/openshift/configuration/jobs/OpenShift%20Sample[sample
Jenkins job] that is pre-configured in the Jenkins image utilizes the
{product-title} pipeline plug-in and serves as an example of how to leverage the
plug-in for creating CI/CD flows for {product-title} in Jenkins.

See the https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-plugin/[the plug-in's README] for a detailed description of what is available.
