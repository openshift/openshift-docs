[[overview]]
== Overview
{product-title} provides a container image for running Jenkins. This image
provides a Jenkins server instance, which can be used to set up a basic flow for
continuous testing, integration, and delivery.

This image also includes a sample Jenkins job, which triggers a new build of a
`*BuildConfig*` defined in {product-title}, tests the output of that build, and
then on successful build, retags the output to indicate the build is ready for
production.

[[jenkins-version]]
== Versions

{product-title} follows the link:https://jenkins.io/changelog-stable/[LTS] releases of Jenkins.
Currently, {product-title} provides versions 1.x and 2.x.

[[jenkins-images]]
== Images

ifdef::openshift-online[]
RHEL 7 images are available through the Red Hat Registry:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-1-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-2-rhel7
----

You can use these images through the `jenkins` image stream.
endif::[]

ifndef::openshift-online[]
These images come in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Images*

The RHEL 7 images are available through the Red Hat Registry:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-1-rhel7
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-2-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Images*

This image is available on Docker Hub:

----
$ docker pull openshift/jenkins-1-centos7
$ docker pull openshift/jenkins-2-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these registries
or push them into your {product-title} Docker registry. Additionally, you can
create an ImageStream that points to the image, either in your Docker registry
or at the external location. Your {product-title} resources can then reference
the ImageStream. You can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example]
ImageStream definitions for all the provided {product-title} images.
endif::[]

[[jenkins-configuration-and-usage]]
== Configuration and Usage

[[jenkins-initializing-jenkins]]
=== Initializing Jenkins

You can manage Jenkins authentication in two ways:

* {product-title} OAuth authentication provided by the OpenShift Login plug-in.

* Standard authentication provided by Jenkins

[[jenkins-openshift-oauth-authentication]]
==== {product-title} OAuth authentication

xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.adoc#oauth[OAuth
authentication] is activated by configuring the `*Configure Global Security*`
panel in the Jenkins UI, or by setting the `*OPENSHIFT_ENABLE_OAUTH*`
environment variable on the Jenkins `*Deployment Config*` to anything other than
`false`. This activates the OpenShift Login plug-in, which retrieves the
configuration information from pod data or by interacting with the
{product-title} API server.

Valid credentials are controlled by the {product-title} identity provider.
ifndef::openshift-online[]
For example, if `Allow All` is the default identity provider, you can provide
any non-empty string for both the user name and password.
endif::openshift-online[]

Jenkins supports both
https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-openshift-login-plugin/blob/master/README.md#browser-access[browser]
and
https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-openshift-login-plugin/blob/master/README.md#non-browser-access[non-browser]
access.

Valid users are automatically added to the Jenkins authorization matrix at log
in, where {product-title} `*Roles*` dictate the specific Jenkins permissions the
user will have.

Users with the `admin` role will have the traditional Jenkins administrative
user permissions. Users with the `edit` or `view` role will have progressively
less permissions. See the
https://github.com/openshift/jenkins#jenkins-admin-user[Jenkins image source
repository README] for the specifics on the OpenShift roles to Jenkins
permissions mappings.


[NOTE]
====
The `admin` user that is pre-populated in the {product-title} Jenkins image with
administrative privileges will not be given those privileges when
{product-title} OAuth is
ifdef::openshift-online[]
used.
endif::[]
ifndef::openshift-online[]
used, unless the {product-title} cluster administrator
explicitly defines that user in the {product-title} identity provider and
assigns the `admin` role to the user.
endif::[]
====

Jenkins' users permissions can be changed after the users are initially
established. The OpenShift Login plug-in polls the {product-title} API server
for permissions and updates the permissions stored in Jenkins for each user with
the permissions retrieved from {product-title}. If the Jenkins UI is used to
update permissions for a Jenkins user, the permission changes are overwritten
the next time the plug-in polls {product-title}.

You can control how often the polling occurs with the
`OPENSHIFT_PERMISSIONS_POLL_INTERVAL` environment variable. The default polling
interval is five minutes.

The easiest way to create a new Jenkins service using OAuth authentication is to
xref:jenkins-creating-jenkins-service-from-template[use a template] as described
below.

[[jenkins-jenkins-standard-authentication]]
==== Jenkins Standard Authentication

Jenkins authentication is used by default if the image is run directly, without
using a template.

The first time Jenkins starts, the configuration is created along with the
administrator user and password. The default user credentials are `*admin*` and
`*password*`. Configure the default password by setting the `*JENKINS_PASSWORD*`
environment variable when using (and only when using) standard Jenkins
authentication.

To create a new Jenkins application using standard Jenkins authentication:

----
$ oc new-app -e \
    JENKINS_PASSWORD=<password> \
    openshift/jenkins-1-centos7
----

[[jenkins-environment-variables]]
=== Environment Variables

The Jenkins server can be configured with the following environment variables:

.Jenkins Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*JENKINS_PASSWORD*`
|The password for the `*admin*` user when using standard Jenkins authentication.
Not applicable when using {product-title} OAuth authentication.

|`*OPENSHIFT_ENABLE_OAUTH*`
|Determines whether the OpenShift Login plug-in manages authentication when
logging into Jenkins. Enabled when set to any non-empty value other than
"false".

|`*OPENSHIFT_PERMISSIONS_POLL_INTERVAL*`
|Specifies in seconds how often the OpenShift Login plug-in polls {product-title}
for the permissions associated with each user defined in Jenkins.

|`*OVERRIDE_PV_CONFIG_WITH_IMAGE_CONFIG*`
|When running this image with an {product-title} persistent volume for the Jenkins
config directory, the transfer of configuration from the image to the persistent
volume is only done the first startup of the image as the persistent volume is
assigned by the persistent volume claim creation. If you create a custom image
that extends this image and updates configuration in the custom image after
the initial startup, by default it will not be copied over, unless you set this
environment variable to some non-empty value.

|`*OVERRIDE_PV_PLUGINS_WITH_IMAGE_PLUGINS*`
|When running this image with an {product-title} persistent volume for the Jenkins
config directory, the transfer of plugins from the image to the persistent
volume is only done the first startup of the image as the persistent volume is
assigned by the persistent volume claim creation. If you create a custom image
that extends this image and updates plugins in the custom image after
the initial startup, by default they will not be copied over, unless you set this
environment variable to some non-empty value.
|===

[[jenkins-cross-project-access]]
=== Cross Project Access

If you are going to run Jenkins somewhere other than as a deployment within your
same project, you will need to provide an access token to Jenkins to access your
project.

. Identify the secret for the service account that has appropriate permissions
to access the project Jenkins needs to access:
+
----
$ oc describe serviceaccount default
Name:       default
Labels:     <none>
Secrets:    {  default-token-uyswp    }
            {  default-dockercfg-xcr3d    }
Tokens:     default-token-izv1u
            default-token-uyswp
----
+
In this case the secret is named `default-token-uyswp`

. Retrieve the token from the secret:
+
----
$ oc describe secret <secret name from above> # e.g. default-token-izv1u
Name:       default-token-izv1u
Labels:     <none>
Annotations:    kubernetes.io/service-account.name=default,kubernetes.io/service-account.uid=32f5b661-2a8f-11e5-9528-3c970e3bf0b7
Type:   kubernetes.io/service-account-token
Data
====
ca.crt: 1066 bytes
token:  eyJhbGc..<content cut>....wRA
----

The token field contains the token value Jenkins needs to access the project.

[[jenkins-volume-mount-points]]
=== Volume Mount Points

The Jenkins image can be run with mounted volumes to enable persistent storage
for the configuration:

* *_/var/lib/jenkins_* - This is the data directory where Jenkins stores configuration files including job definitions.

[[jenkins-creating-jenkins-service-from-template]]
== Creating a Jenkins Service from a Template

xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[Templates] provide parameter fields to
define all the environment variables (password) with predefined defaults.
{product-title} provides templates to make creating a new Jenkins service easy. The
Jenkins templates should have been registered in the default *openshift* project
by your cluster administrator during the initial cluster setup.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
See xref:../../install_config/imagestreams_templates.adoc#install-config-imagestreams-templates[Loading the Default Image Streams and Templates]
for more details, if required.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-online[]
A template is provided that defines
endif::[]
ifndef::openshift-online[]
The two available templates both define
endif::[]
a xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configuration] and a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[service].
ifndef::openshift-online[]
The templates differ in their storage strategy, which affects whether or not
the Jenkins content persists across a pod restart.
endif::[]

[NOTE]
====
A pod may be restarted when it is moved to another node, or when an update of
the deployment configuration triggers a redeployment.
====

ifndef::openshift-online[]
* `jenkins-ephemeral` uses ephemeral storage. On pod restart, all data is lost.
This template is useful for development or testing only.
endif::[]

* `jenkins-persistent` uses a persistent volume store. Data survives a pod
restart.
ifndef::openshift-online[]
To use a persistent volume store, the cluster administrator must
define a persistent volume pool in the {product-title} deployment.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-online[]
You
endif::[]
ifndef::openshift-online[]
Once you have selected which template you want, you
endif::[]
must xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[instantiate] the
template to be able to use Jenkins:

.Creating a New Jenkins Service

ifdef::openshift-online[]
. Create a new Jenkins application using a persistent volume:
----

----

[NOTE]
====
If you instantiate the template against releases prior to v3.4 of
{product-title}, standard Jenkins authentication is used, and the default
`admin` account will exist with password `password`. See
xref:../../using_images/other_images/jenkins.adoc#jenkins-jenkins-standard-authentication[Jenkins
Standard Authentication] for details about changing this password.

endif::[]

[[jenkins-as-s2i-builder]]
== Using Jenkins as a Source-To-Image builder

To customize the official {product-title} Jenkins image, you have two options:

* Use Docker layering.
* Use the image as a Source-To-Image builder, described here.

You can use xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/build.adoc#source-build[S2I]
to copy your custom Jenkins Jobs definitions, additional
plug-ins or replace the provided *_config.xml_* file with your own, custom, configuration.

In order to include your modifications in the Jenkins image, you need to have a Git
repository with the following directory structure:

*_plugins_*::
This directory contains those binary Jenkins plug-ins you want to copy into Jenkins.

*_plugins.txt_*::
This file lists the plug-ins you want to install:

----
pluginId:pluginVersion
----

*_configuration/jobs_*::
This directory contains the Jenkins job definitions.

*_configuration/config.xml_*::
This file contains your custom Jenkins configuration.

The contents of the *_configuration/_* directory will be copied
into the *_/var/lib/jenkins/_* directory, so you can also include
additional files, such as *_credentials.xml_*, there.

The following is an example build configuration that customizes the Jenkins
image in {product-title}:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
  name: custom-jenkins-build
spec:
  source:                       <1>
    git:
      uri: https://github.com/custom/repository
    type: Git
  strategy:                     <2>
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: jenkins:latest
        namespace: openshift
    type: Source
  output:                       <3>
    to:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: custom-jenkins:latest
----

<1> The `source` field defines the source Git repository
with the layout described above.
<2> The `strategy` field defines the original Jenkins image to use
as a source image for the build.
<3> The `output` field defines the resulting, customized Jenkins image
you can use in deployment configuration instead of the official Jenkins image.

[[using-the-jenkins-kubernetes-plug-in-to-run-jobs]]
== Using the Jenkins Kubernetes Plug-in to Run Jobs

The official {product-title} Jenkins image includes the pre-installed
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin[Kubernetes
plug-in] that allows Jenkins slaves to be dynamically provisioned on multiple
container hosts using Kubernetes and {product-title}.

To use the Kubernetes plug-in, {product-title} provides three images
suitable for use as Jenkins slaves: the *_Base_*, *_Maven_*, and *_Node.js_* images.

The first is a link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/slave-base[base image] for Jenkins slaves:

 - It pulls in both the required tools (headless Java, the Jenkins JNLP client) and the useful ones
(including git, tar, zip, and nss among others).
 - It establishes the JNLP slave agent as the entrypoint.
 - It includes the oc client tooling for invoking command line operations from within Jenkins jobs, and
 - It provides Dockerfiles for both CentOS and RHEL images.

Two additional images that extend the base image are also provided:

* link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/slave-maven[Maven]
* link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/slave-nodejs[Node.js]

Both the Maven and Node.js slave images are configured as Kubernetes Pod
Template images within the {product-title} Jenkins image's configuration for the
Kubernetes plug-in. That configuration includes labels for each of the images
that can be applied to any of your Jenkins jobs under their "Restrict where this
project can be run" setting. If the label is applied, execution of the given job
will be done under an {product-title} pod running the respective slave image.

The Maven and Node.js Jenkins slave images provide Dockerfiles for both CentOS
and RHEL that you can reference when building new slave images. Also note the
`contrib` and `contrib/bin` subdirectories. They allow for the insertion of
configuration files and executable scripts for your image.

The Jenkins image also provides auto-discovery and auto-configuration of slave
images for the Kubernetes plug-in. With the
link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-sync-plugin[OpenShift Sync plug-in],
the Jenkins image on Jenkins start-up searches within the project that it is
running, or the projects specifically listed in the plug-in's configuration for
the following:

- Image streams that have the label `role` set to `jenkins-slave`.
- Image stream tags that have the annotation `role` set to `jenkins-slave`.
- ConfigMaps that have the label `role` set to `jenkins-slave`.

When it finds an image stream with the appropriate label, or image stream tag
with the appropriate  annotation, it generates the corresponding Kubernetes
plug-in configuration so you can assign your Jenkins jobs to run in a pod
running the container image provided by the image stream.

The name and image references of the image stream or image stream tag are mapped
to the name and image fields in the Kubernetes plug-in pod template. You can
control the label field of the Kubernetes plug-in pod template by setting an
annotation on the image stream or image stream tag object with the key
`slave-label`. Otherwise, the name is used as the label.

When it finds a ConfigMap with the appropriate label, it assumes that any
values in the key-value data payload of the ConfigMap contains XML consistent
with the config format for Jenkins and the Kubernetes plug-in pod templates. A
key differentiator to note when using ConfigMaps, instead of image streams or
image stream tags, is that you can control all the various fields of the
Kubernetes plug-in pod template.

The following is an example ConfigMap:

After startup, the

monitors the API server of {product-title} for updates to `ImageStreams`,
`ImageStreamTags`, and `ConfigMaps` and adjusts the configuration of the
Kubernetes plug-in based on the presence or absence of the noted labels and
annotations.

To use a container image as a Jenkins slave, the image must run the slave agent as
an entrypoint. For more details about this, refer to the official
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds#Distributedbuilds-Launchslaveagentheadlessly[Jenkins
documentation].

[[tutorial]]
== Tutorial

For more details on the sample job included in this image, see this link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/README.md[tutorial].

[[pipeline-plug-in]]
== {product-title} Pipeline Plug-in

The Jenkins image's list of pre-installed plug-ins includes the OpenShift
Pipeline plug-in, which assists in the creation of CI/CD workflows in Jenkins
that run against an {product-title} server. A series of build steps, post-build
actions, and SCM-style polling are provided, which equate to administrative and
operational actions on the {product-title} server and the API artifacts hosted
there.

In addition to being accessible from the classic "freestyle" form of Jenkins
job, the build steps as of version 1.0.14 of the {product-title} Pipeline
Plug-in are also available to Jenkins Pipeline jobs via the DSL extension points
provided by the Jenkins Pipeline Plug-in. The link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/jenkins/pipeline[OpenShift Jenkins Pipeline build strategy sample]
illustrates how to use the OpenShift Pipeline plugin DSL versions of its steps.

The
https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/1/contrib/openshift/configuration/jobs/OpenShift%20Sample[sample
Jenkins job] that is pre-configured in the Jenkins image utilizes the
{product-title} pipeline plug-in and serves as an example of how to leverage the
plug-in for creating CI/CD flows for {product-title} in Jenkins.

See the link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-plugin/[the plug-in's README] for a
detailed description of what is available.

[[client-plugin-in]]
== {product-title} Client Plug-in

The experiences gained working with users of the OpenShift Pipeline plug-in,
coupled with the rapid evolution of both Jenkins and OpenShift, have provided
valuable insight into how to integrate {product-title} from Jenkins jobs.

As such, the new experimental
link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-client-plugin[OpenShift Client Plug-in
for Jenkins] is now offered as a technical preview and is included in the
OpenShift Jenkins images on CentOS
(*docker.io/openshift/jenkins-1-centos7:latest* and
*docker.io/openshift/jenkins-2-centos7:latest*). The plug-in is also available
from the Jenkins Update Center. The OpenShift Client plug-in will eventually
replace the OpenShift Pipeline plug-in as the tool for OpenShift integration
from Jenkins jobs. The OpenShift Client Plug-in provides:

- A Fluent-style syntax for use in Jenkins Pipelines.
- Use of and exposure to any option available with `oc`.
- Integration with Jenkins credentials and clusters.
- Continued support for classic Jenkins Freestyle jobs.

[[sync-plug-in]]
== {product-title} Sync Plug-in

To facilitate {product-title}
xref:../../dev_guide/builds/build_strategies.adoc#pipeline-strategy-options[Pipeline
build strategy] for integration between Jenkins and {product-title}, the
link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-sync-plugin[OpenShift Sync plug-in]
monitors the API server of {product-title} for updates to `BuildConfigs` and
`Builds` that employ the Pipeline strategy and either creates Jenkins Pipeline
projects (when a `BuildConfig` is created) or starts jobs in the resulting
projects (when a `Build` is started).

[[kubernetes-plug-in]]
== Kubernetes Plug-in

The Kubernetes plug-in is used to run Jenkins slaves as pods on your cluster.
The auto-configuration of the Kubernetes plug-in is described
in xref:../../using_images/other_images/jenkins.adoc#using-the-jenkins-kubernetes-plug-in-to-run-jobs[Using the Jenkins Kubernetes Plug-in to Run Jobs].

[[memory-requirements]]
== Memory Requirements

The default memory allocation for the Jenkins container is 512Mi, regardless of
whether you are using the Jenkins Ephemeral or Jenkins Persistent template.
While Jenkins can easily operate within this limit, you will need to be
mindful of any `sh` invocations that you might be making from your pipelines,
such as shell scripts, invoking the `oc` command through the OpenShift DSL,
or monitoring PIDs, as these can quickly use your memory allocation.

You can increase the amount of memory available to Jenkins by overriding
the *MEMORY_LIMIT* paramenter when instantiating the Jenkins Ephemeral or
Jenkins Persistent template.
