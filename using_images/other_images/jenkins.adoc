== Overview
{product-title} provides a container image for running Jenkins. This image
provides a Jenkins server instance, which can be used to set up a basic flow for
continuous testing, integration, and delivery.

This image also includes a sample Jenkins job, which triggers a new build of a
`*BuildConfig*` defined in {product-title}, tests the output of that build, and
then on successful build, retags the output to indicate the build is ready for
production. For more details, see the
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/README.md[README].

{product-title} follows the link:https://jenkins.io/changelog-stable/[LTS]
release of Jenkins. {product-title} provides an image containing Jenkins 2.x.
A separate image with Jenkins 1.x was previously made available but is now no
longer maintained.

[[jenkins-images]]
== Images

ifdef::openshift-online[]
The RHEL 7 image is available through the Red Hat Registry:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-2-rhel7
----

You can use this image through the `jenkins` image stream.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-online[]
The {product-title} Jenkins image comes in two flavors:

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through the Red Hat Registry:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-2-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on Docker Hub:

----
$ docker pull openshift/jenkins-2-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these registries
or push them into your {product-title} Docker registry. Additionally, you can
create an ImageStream that points to the image, either in your Docker registry
or at the external location. Your {product-title} resources can then reference
the ImageStream. You can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example]
ImageStream definitions for all the provided {product-title} images.
endif::[]

[[jenkins-configuration-and-usage]]
== Configuration and Customization

[[jenkins-authentication]]
=== Authentication

You can manage Jenkins authentication in two ways:

* {product-title} OAuth authentication provided by the OpenShift Login plug-in.

* Standard authentication provided by Jenkins

[[jenkins-openshift-oauth-authentication]]
==== {product-title} OAuth authentication

xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.adoc#oauth[OAuth
authentication] is activated by configuring the `*Configure Global Security*`
panel in the Jenkins UI, or by setting the `*OPENSHIFT_ENABLE_OAUTH*`
environment variable on the Jenkins `*Deployment Config*` to anything other than
`false`. This activates the OpenShift Login plug-in, which retrieves the
configuration information from pod data or by interacting with the
{product-title} API server.

Valid credentials are controlled by the {product-title} identity provider.
ifdef::openshift-online[]
For example, if `Allow All` is the default identity provider, you can provide
any non-empty string for both the user name and password.
endif::openshift-online[]

Jenkins supports both
https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-openshift-login-plugin/blob/master/README.md#browser-access[browser]
and
https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-openshift-login-plugin/blob/master/README.md#non-browser-access[non-browser]
access.

Valid users are automatically added to the Jenkins authorization matrix at log
in, where {product-title} `*Roles*` dictate the specific Jenkins permissions the
users have.

Users with the `admin` role have the traditional Jenkins administrative
user permissions. Users with the `edit` or `view` role have progressively
fewer permissions. See the
https://github.com/openshift/jenkins#jenkins-admin-user[Jenkins image source
repository README] for the specifics on the OpenShift roles to Jenkins
permissions mappings.


[NOTE]
====
The `admin` user that is pre-populated in the {product-title} Jenkins image with
administrative privileges is not given those privileges when
{product-title} OAuth is
ifdef::openshift-online[]
used.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-online[]
used, unless the {product-title} cluster administrator
explicitly defines that user in the {product-title} identity provider and
assigns the `admin` role to the user.
endif::[]
====

Jenkins' users permissions can be changed after the users are initially
established. The OpenShift Login plug-in polls the {product-title} API server
for permissions and updates the permissions stored in Jenkins for each user with
the permissions retrieved from {product-title}. If the Jenkins UI is used to
update permissions for a Jenkins user, the permission changes are overwritten
the next time the plug-in polls {product-title}.

You can control how often the polling occurs with the
`OPENSHIFT_PERMISSIONS_POLL_INTERVAL` environment variable. The default polling
interval is five minutes.

The easiest way to create a new Jenkins service using OAuth authentication is to
xref:jenkins-creating-jenkins-service-from-template[use a template] as described
below.

[[jenkins-jenkins-standard-authentication]]
==== Jenkins Standard Authentication

Jenkins authentication is used by default if the image is run directly, without
using a template.

The first time Jenkins starts, the configuration is created along with the
administrator user and password. The default user credentials are `*admin*` and
`*password*`. Configure the default password by setting the `*JENKINS_PASSWORD*`
environment variable when using (and only when using) standard Jenkins
authentication.

To create a new Jenkins application using standard Jenkins authentication:

----
$ oc new-app -e \
    JENKINS_PASSWORD=<password> \
    openshift/jenkins-2-centos7
----

[[jenkins-environment-variables]]
=== Environment Variables

The Jenkins server can be configured with the following environment variables:

* `OPENSHIFT_ENABLE_OAUTH` (default: `false`)
+
Determines whether the OpenShift Login plug-in manages authentication when
logging into Jenkins. To enable, set to `true`.

* `JENKINS_PASSWORD` (default: `password`)
+
The password for the `admin` user when using standard Jenkins authentication.
Not applicable when `OPENSHIFT_ENABLE_OAUTH` is set to `true`.

* `OPENSHIFT_JENKINS_JVM_ARCH`
+
Set to `x86_64` or `i386` to override the JVM used to host Jenkins. For memory
efficiency, by default the Jenkins image dynamically uses a 32-bit JVM if
running in a container with a memory limit under 2GiB.

* `JAVA_MAX_HEAP_PARAM` +
`CONTAINER_HEAP_PERCENT` (default: `0.5`, or 50%) +
`JENKINS_MAX_HEAP_UPPER_BOUND_MB` +
+
These values control the maximum heap size of the Jenkins JVM. If
`JAVA_MAX_HEAP_PARAM` is set (example setting: `-Xmx512m`), its value takes
precedence. Otherwise, the maximum heap size is dynamically calculated as
`CONTAINER_HEAP_PERCENT`% (example setting: `0.5`, or 50%) of the container
memory limit, optionally capped at `JENKINS_MAX_HEAP_UPPER_BOUND_MB` MiB
(example setting: `512`).
+
By default, the maximum heap size of the Jenkins JVM is set to 50% of the
container memory limit with no cap.

* `JAVA_INITIAL_HEAP_PARAM` +
`CONTAINER_INITIAL_PERCENT`
+
These values control the initial heap size of the Jenkins JVM. If
`JAVA_INITIAL_HEAP_PARAM` is set (example setting: `-Xms32m`), its value takes
precedence. Otherwise, the initial heap size may be dynamically calculated as
`CONTAINER_INITIAL_PERCENT`% (example setting: `0.1`, or 10%) of the
dynamically calculated maximum heap size.
+
By default, the initial heap sizing is left to the JVM.

* `CONTAINER_CORE_LIMIT`
+
If set, specifies an integer number of cores used for sizing numbers of internal
JVM threads. Example setting: `2`.

* `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` (default: `-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap -Dsun.zip.disableMemoryMapping=true`)
+
Specifies options to be heeded by all JVMs running in this container. It is not
recommended to override this.

* `JAVA_GC_OPTS` (default: `-XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=5 -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=10 -XX:GCTimeRatio=4 -XX:AdaptiveSizePolicyWeight=90`)
+
Specifies Jenkins JVM garbage collection parameters. It is not recommended to
override this.

* `JENKINS_JAVA_OVERRIDES`
+
Specifies additional options for the Jenkins JVM. These options are appended to
all other options, including the Java options above, and may be used to override
any of them if necessary. Separate each additional option with a space; if any
option contains space characters, escape them with a backslash. Example
settings: `-Dfoo -Dbar`; `-Dfoo=first\ value -Dbar=second\ value`.

* `JENKINS_OPTS`
+
Specifies arguments to Jenkins.

* `INSTALL_PLUGINS`
+
Specifies additional Jenkins plug-ins to install when the container is first run
or when `OVERRIDE_PV_PLUGINS_WITH_IMAGE_PLUGINS` is set to `true` (see below).
Plug-ins are specified as a comma-delimited list of name:version pairs. Example
setting: `git:3.7.0,subversion:2.10.2`.

* `OPENSHIFT_PERMISSIONS_POLL_INTERVAL` (default: `300000` - 5 minutes)
+
Specifies in milliseconds how often the OpenShift Login plug-in polls
{product-title} for the permissions associated with each user defined in Jenkins.

* `OVERRIDE_PV_CONFIG_WITH_IMAGE_CONFIG` (default: `false`)
+
When running this image with an {product-title} persistent volume for the Jenkins
config directory, the transfer of configuration from the image to the persistent
volume is only done the first startup of the image as the persistent volume is
assigned by the persistent volume claim creation. If you create a custom image
that extends this image and updates configuration in the custom image after
the initial startup, by default it is not copied over, unless you set this
environment variable to `true`.

* `OVERRIDE_PV_PLUGINS_WITH_IMAGE_PLUGINS` (default: `false`)
+
When running this image with an {product-title} persistent volume for the Jenkins
config directory, the transfer of plugins from the image to the persistent
volume is only done the first startup of the image as the persistent volume is
assigned by the persistent volume claim creation. If you create a custom image
that extends this image and updates plugins in the custom image after
the initial startup, by default they are not copied over, unless you set this
environment variable to `true`.

[[jenkins-cross-project-access]]
=== Cross Project Access

If you are going to run Jenkins somewhere other than as a deployment within your
same project, you need to provide an access token to Jenkins to access your
project.

. Identify the secret for the service account that has appropriate permissions
to access the project Jenkins needs to access:
+
----
$ oc describe serviceaccount jenkins
Name:       default
Labels:     <none>
Secrets:    {  jenkins-token-uyswp    }
            {  jenkins-dockercfg-xcr3d    }
Tokens:     jenkins-token-izv1u
            jenkins-token-uyswp
----
+
In this case the secret is named `jenkins-token-uyswp`

. Retrieve the token from the secret:
+
----
$ oc describe secret <secret name from above> # for example, jenkins-token-uyswp
Name:       jenkins-token-uyswp
Labels:     <none>
Annotations:    kubernetes.io/service-account.name=jenkins,kubernetes.io/service-account.uid=32f5b661-2a8f-11e5-9528-3c970e3bf0b7
Type:   kubernetes.io/service-account-token
Data
====
ca.crt: 1066 bytes
token:  eyJhbGc..<content cut>....wRA
----

The token field contains the token value Jenkins needs to access the project.

[[jenkins-volume-mount-points]]
=== Volume Mount Points

The Jenkins image can be run with mounted volumes to enable persistent storage
for the configuration:

* *_/var/lib/jenkins_* - This is the data directory where Jenkins stores configuration files including job definitions.

[[jenkins-as-s2i-builder]]
=== Customizing the Jenkins Image through Source-To-Image

To customize the official {product-title} Jenkins image, you have two options:

* Use Docker layering.
* Use the image as a Source-To-Image builder, described here.

You can use xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#source-build[S2I]
to copy your custom Jenkins Jobs definitions, additional
plug-ins or replace the provided *_config.xml_* file with your own, custom, configuration.

In order to include your modifications in the Jenkins image, you need to have a Git
repository with the following directory structure:

*_plugins_*::
This directory contains those binary Jenkins plug-ins you want to copy into Jenkins.

*_plugins.txt_*::
This file lists the plug-ins you want to install:

----
pluginId:pluginVersion
----

*_configuration/jobs_*::
This directory contains the Jenkins job definitions.

*_configuration/config.xml_*::
This file contains your custom Jenkins configuration.

The contents of the *_configuration/_* directory is copied
into the *_/var/lib/jenkins/_* directory, so you can also include
additional files, such as *_credentials.xml_*, there.

The following is an example build configuration that customizes the Jenkins
image in {product-title}:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
  name: custom-jenkins-build
spec:
  source:                       <1>
    git:
      uri: https://github.com/custom/repository
    type: Git
  strategy:                     <2>
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: jenkins:latest
        namespace: openshift
    type: Source
  output:                       <3>
    to:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: custom-jenkins:latest
----

<1> The `source` field defines the source Git repository
with the layout described above.
<2> The `strategy` field defines the original Jenkins image to use
as a source image for the build.
<3> The `output` field defines the resulting, customized Jenkins image
you can use in deployment configuration instead of the official Jenkins image.

[[configuring-the-jenkins-kubernetes-plug-in]]
=== Configuring the Jenkins Kubernetes Plug-in

The {product-title} Jenkins image includes the pre-installed
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin[Kubernetes
plug-in] that allows Jenkins agents to be dynamically provisioned on multiple
container hosts using Kubernetes and {product-title}.

To use the Kubernetes plug-in, {product-title} provides five images suitable
for use as Jenkins agents: the *_Base_*, *_Maven_*, and *_Node.js_* images. See
xref:jenkins_slaves.adoc#overview[Jenkins Agents] for more information.

[NOTE]
====
The jenkins-slave-maven-* and jenkins-slave-nodejs-* images are being
marked as deprecated during the v3.10 release cycle. The images still
exist in the interim so users can migrate their applications to the newer
jenkins-agent-maven-* and jenkins-agent-nodejs-* images.
====

Both the Maven and Node.js agent images are automatically configured as
Kubernetes Pod Template images within the {product-title} Jenkins image's
configuration for the Kubernetes plug-in. That configuration includes labels for
each of the images that can be applied to any of your Jenkins jobs under their
"Restrict where this project can be run" setting. If the label is applied,
execution of the given job is done under an {product-title} pod running the
respective agent image.

The Jenkins image also provides auto-discovery and auto-configuration of
additional agent images for the Kubernetes plug-in. With the
link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-sync-plugin[OpenShift Sync plug-in],
the Jenkins image on Jenkins start-up searches within the project that it is
running, or the projects specifically listed in the plug-in's configuration for
the following:

- Image streams that have the label `role` set to `jenkins-slave`.
- Image stream tags that have the annotation `role` set to `jenkins-slave`.
- ConfigMaps that have the label `role` set to `jenkins-slave`.

When it finds an image stream with the appropriate label, or image stream tag
with the appropriate annotation, it generates the corresponding Kubernetes
plug-in configuration so you can assign your Jenkins jobs to run in a pod
running the container image provided by the image stream.

The name and image references of the image stream or image stream tag are mapped
to the name and image fields in the Kubernetes plug-in pod template. You can
control the label field of the Kubernetes plug-in pod template by setting an
annotation on the image stream or image stream tag object with the key
`slave-label`. Otherwise, the name is used as the label.

When it finds a ConfigMap with the appropriate label, it assumes that any
values in the key-value data payload of the ConfigMap contains XML consistent
with the config format for Jenkins and the Kubernetes plug-in pod templates. A
key differentiator to note when using ConfigMaps, instead of image streams or
image stream tags, is that you can control all the various fields of the
Kubernetes plug-in pod template.

The following is an example ConfigMap:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: jenkins-agent
  labels:
    role: jenkins-slave

      <annotations/>
      <imagePullSecrets/>
      <nodeProperties/>
    </org.csanchez.jenkins.plugins.kubernetes.PodTemplate>
----

After startup, the
link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-sync-plugin[OpenShift Sync plug-in]
monitors the API server of {product-title} for updates to `ImageStreams`,
`ImageStreamTags`, and `ConfigMaps` and adjusts the configuration of the
Kubernetes plug-in.

In particular, the following rules apply:

- Removal of the label or annotation from the `ConfigMap`, `ImageStream`, or
`ImageStreamTag` result in the deletion of any existing `PodTemplate` from
the configuration of the Kubernetes plug-in.
- Similarly, if those objects are removed, the corresponding configuration
is removed from the Kubernetes plug-in.
- Conversely, either the creation of appropriately labeled or annotated `ConfigMap`,
`ImageStream`, or `ImageStreamTag` objects, or the adding of labels after their
initial creation, leads to the creation of a `PodTemplate` in the Kubernetes-plugin
configuration.
- In the case of the `PodTemplate` via `ConfigMap` form, changes to the `ConfigMap`
data for the `PodTemplate` is applied to the `PodTemplate` settings in the
Kubernetes plug-in configuration, and overrides any changes made to the
`PodTemplate` through the Jenkins UI in the interim between changes to the `ConfigMap`.

To use a container image as a Jenkins agent, the image must run the slave agent as
an entrypoint. For more details about this, refer to the official
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds#Distributedbuilds-Launchslaveagentheadlessly[Jenkins
documentation].

== Usage

[[jenkins-creating-jenkins-service-from-template]]
=== Creating a Jenkins Service from a Template

xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[Templates] provide parameter fields to
define all the environment variables (password) with predefined defaults.
{product-title} provides templates to make creating a new Jenkins service easy. The
Jenkins templates should have been registered in the default *openshift* project
by your cluster administrator during the initial cluster setup.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
See xref:../../install_config/imagestreams_templates.adoc#install-config-imagestreams-templates[Loading the Default Image Streams and Templates]

configuration] and a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[service].
ifdef::openshift-online[]
The templates differ in their storage strategy, which affects whether or not
the Jenkins content persists across a pod restart.
endif::[]

[NOTE]
====
A pod may be restarted when it is moved to another node, or when an update of
the deployment configuration triggers a redeployment.
====

ifdef::openshift-online[]
* `jenkins-ephemeral` uses ephemeral storage. On pod restart, all data is lost.
This template is useful for development or testing only.
endif::[]

* `jenkins-persistent` uses a persistent volume store. Data survives a pod
restart.
ifdef::openshift-online[]
To use a persistent volume store, the cluster administrator must
define a persistent volume pool in the {product-title} deployment.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-online[]
You

ifdef::openshift-online[]
Once you have selected which template you want, you

[[using-the-jenkins-kubernetes-plug-in]]
=== Using the Jenkins Kubernetes Plug-in

In the below sample, the openshift-jee-sample BuildConfig causes a Jenkins maven
agent Pod to be dynamically provisioned. The Pod clones some Java source,
builds a WAR file, then causes a second BuildConfig
(openshift-jee-sample-docker) to run to layer the newly created WAR file into a
Docker image.

A fuller sample which achieves a similar goal is available
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/pipeline/maven-pipeline.yaml[here].

specify it by name. All Jenkins agent images shipped with {product-title} use
the Container name "jnlp".
<5> The Container image must be re-specified. This is a known issue.
<6> A memory request of 512Mi is specified.
<7> A memory limit of 512Mi is specified.
<8> An environment variable CONTAINER_HEAP_PERCENT, with value "0.25", is
specified.
<9> The node stanza references the name of the Pod template newly defined above.

[[memory-requirements]]
=== Memory Requirements

When deployed by the provided Jenkins Ephemeral or Jenkins Persistent
templates, the default memory limit is 512MiB.

See xref:../../dev_guide/application_memory_sizing.adoc#sizing-openjdk[Sizing
OpenJDK on {product-title}] for background information on tuning the JVM used by
Jenkins.

For memory efficiency, by default the Jenkins image dynamically uses a 32-bit
JVM if running in a container with a memory limit under 2GiB. This behavior can
be overridden by the `OPENSHIFT_JENKINS_JVM_ARCH` environment variable.

By default the Jenkins JVM uses 50% of the container memory limit for its heap.
This value can be modified by the `CONTAINER_HEAP_PERCENT` environment
variable. It can also be capped at an upper limit or overridden entirely. See
xref:#jenkins-environment-variables[Environment Variables] for more details.

Consider that by default all other processes executed in the Jenkins
container, such as shell scripts or `oc` commands run locally from pipelines, are
not likely to be able to use more than the remaining 256MiB memory combined
without provoking an OOM kill. It is therefore highly recommended that
pipelines run external commands in a agent container wherever possible.

It is recommended to specify memory request and limit values on agent containers
created by the Jenkins Kubernetes Plug-in. As admin, defaults can be set on a
per-agent image basis through the Jenkins configuration. The memory request
and limit can also be overridden on a per-container basis as documented
xref:#using-the-jenkins-kubernetes-plug-in[above].

You can increase the amount of memory available to Jenkins by overriding
the *MEMORY_LIMIT* paramenter when instantiating the Jenkins Ephemeral or
Jenkins Persistent template.

[[plug-ins]]
== Jenkins Plug-ins

The following plug-ins are provided to integrate Jenkins with {product-title}.
They are available by default in the Jenkins image.

[[client-plug-in]]
=== {product-title} Client Plug-in

The {product-title} Client Plug-in aims to provide a readable, concise,
comprehensive, and fluent Jenkins Pipeline syntax for rich interactions with
{product-title}. The plug-in leverages the `oc` binary, which must be available
on the nodes executing the script.

This plug-in is fully supported and is included in the Jenkins image.
It provides:

- A Fluent-style syntax for use in Jenkins Pipelines.
- Use of and exposure to any option available with `oc`.
- Integration with Jenkins credentials and clusters.
- Continued support for classic Jenkins Freestyle jobs.

See the xref:../../dev_guide/dev_tutorials/openshift_pipeline.adoc#[OpenShift
Pipeline Builds tutorial] and
link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-client-plugin[the plug-in's README]
for more information.

[[pipeline-plug-in]]
=== {product-title} Pipeline Plug-in

The {product-title} Pipeline Plug-in is a prior integration between Jenkins and
{product-title} which provides less functionality than the {product-title}
Client Plug-in. It remains available and supported.

See link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-plugin[the plug-in's README] for
more information.

[[sync-plug-in]]
=== {product-title} Sync Plug-in

To facilitate {product-title}
xref:../../dev_guide/builds/build_strategies.adoc#pipeline-strategy-options[Pipeline
build strategy] for integration between Jenkins and {product-title}, the
link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-sync-plugin[OpenShift Sync Plug-in]
monitors the API server of {product-title} for updates to `BuildConfigs` and
`Builds` that employ the Pipeline strategy and either creates Jenkins Pipeline
projects (when a `BuildConfig` is created) or starts jobs in the resulting
projects (when a `Build` is started).

As noted in xref:configuring-the-jenkins-kubernetes-plug-in[Configuring the
Jenkins Kubernetes Plug-in], this plug-in can create `PodTemplate`
configurations for the Kubernetes plug-in based on specifically cited
`ImageStream`, `ImageStreamTag`, or `ConfigMap` objects defined in
{product-title}.

This plug-in can now take `Secret` objects with a label key of
`credential.sync.jenkins.openshift.io` and label value of `true` and construct
Jenkins credentials which are placed in the default global domain within
the Jenkins credentials hierarchy. The ID of the credential is composed
of the namespace the `Secret` is defined in, a hyphen (`-`), followed by the
name of the `Secret`.

Similar to the handling of `ConfigMaps` for `PodTemplates`, the `Secret` object
defined in {product-title} is considered the master configuration. Any subsequent
updates to the object in {product-title} are applied to the Jenkins credential
(overwriting any changes to the credential made in the interim).

Removal of the `credential.sync.jenkins.openshift.io` property, setting of that
property to something other than `true`, or deletion of the `Secret` in
{product-title} results in deletion of the associated credential in Jenkins.

The type of secret is mapped to the jenkins credential type as follows:

- With Opaque type `Secret` objects the plug-in looks for `username` and
`password` in the `data` section and constructs a Jenkins
UsernamePasswordCredentials credential. Remember, in {product-title} the
`password` field can be either an actual password or the user's unique token.
If those are not present, it looks for the `ssh-privatekey` field and create
a Jenkins BasicSSHUserPrivateKey credential.
- With `kubernetes.io/basic-auth` type `Secret`objects the plug-in creates a
Jenkins UsernamePasswordCredentials credential.
- With `kubernetes.io/ssh-auth` type `Secret` objects the plug-in creates a
Jenkins BasicSSHUserPrivateKey credential.

[[kubernetes-plug-in]]
=== Kubernetes Plug-in

The Kubernetes plug-in is used to run Jenkins agents as pods on your cluster.
The auto-configuration of the Kubernetes plug-in is described
in xref:../../using_images/other_images/jenkins.adoc#using-the-jenkins-kubernetes-plug-in[Using the Jenkins Kubernetes Plug-in].
