== Overview
{product-title} provides a container image for running Jenkins.  This image provides a Jenkins server instance which can be used to set up a basic flow for continuous testing, integration, and delivery.

This image also includes a sample Jenkins job which triggers a new build of a `*BuildConfig*` defined in {product-title}, tests the output of that build, and then on successful build, retags the output to indicate the build is ready for production.

[[versions]]
== Versions

{product-title} follows the https://jenkins.io/changelog-stable/[LTS] releases of Jenkins.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-1-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/jenkins-1-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these registries or push them into your {product-title} Docker registry.
Additionally, you can create an ImageStream that points to the image, either in your Docker registry or at the external location.
Your {product-title} resources can then reference the ImageStream.
You can find https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example] ImageStream definitions for all the provided {product-title} images.

== Configuration and Usage

=== Initializing Jenkins

There are two methods for managing authentication with the {product-title} Jenkins images when they are initially started.

* {product-title} OAuth authentication provided by the OpenShift Login plugin.

* Standard authentication provided by Jenkins

==== {product-title} OAuth authentication

{product-title} OAuth authentication will be used when it is explicitly configured in the `*Configure Global Security*` panel in the Jenkins UI, or it will be used automatically when the OpenShift Login plugin
determines that it is running in a pod and the `*OPENSHIFT_ENABLE_OAUTH*` environment variable on the Jenkins `*Deployment Config*` is set to anything other than `false`.  The plugin will retrieve the
configuration information needed either from data seeded into the pod, or by interacting with the {product-title} API server via REST invocations.  There are configuration fields available for the plugin, but
they should only be required for development testing or atypical configurations accessing a different {product-title} installation for OAuth than the installation hosting Jenkins.

The login process is comprised of a series of HTTP redirects.  Rather than the traditional Jenkins login page, you will first be directed to an {product-title} login page, similar to what you see when you log into the web console.  If login
is successful, you will be redirected to the page within the Jenkins UI you are trying to access.

Valid user / password combinations are controlled by the identity provider in use with {product-title}.  So, for example,  if the default identity provider `Allow All` is used, you can provide any non-empty string for both the user name
and password.  If you supply the user name used to create the `*Project*` Jenkins is running in, you will have administrative privileges within Jenkins.

If one of the other identity providers is running, valid user/password combinations stored with your identity provider must be used to login.

Valid users are automatically added to the Jenkins authorization matrix as part of login.

The {product-title} `*Role*` of the user then dictates which permissions within the Jenkins authorization matrix are associated with the user.  The `admin` `*Role*` maps to the set of
permissions traditionally associated with the `admin` user in the {product-title} Jenkins image:

* hudson.model.Computer.Configure
* hudson.model.Computer.Delete
* hudson.model.Hudson.Administer
* hudson.model.Hudson.Read
* hudson.model.Item.Build
* hudson.model.Item.Configure
* hudson.model.Item.Create
* hudson.model.Item.Delete
* hudson.model.Item.Read
* hudson.model.Item.Workspace
* hudson.model.Run.Delete
* hudson.model.Run.Update
* hudson.model.View.Configure
* hudson.model.View.Create
* hudson.model.View.Delete
* hudson.scm.SCM.Tag

Users with the `edit` or `view``*Roles*` for the {product-title} project have progressively reduced permissions within Jenkins.

For the `view` `*Role*`:

* hudson.model.Hudson.Read
* hudson.model.Item.Read

For the `edit` `*Role*`, in addition to the permissions available to `*view*`:

* hudson.model.Item.Build
* hudson.model.Item.Configure
* hudson.model.Item.Create
* hudson.model.Item.Delete
* hudson.model.Item.Workspace
* hudson.scm.SCM.Tag

Users authenticated against {product-title} OAuth will be added to the Jenkins authorization matrix upon their first successful login.

[NOTE]
====
The user name used to create the project Jenkins is running in will have the `admin` `*Role*` assigned to it.  So consider that the default
administrative user for Jenkins when using {product-title} OAuth to manage authentication.

The `admin` user that is pre-populated in the {product-title} Jenkins image with administrative privileges will not be honored with those
privileges when {product-title} OAuth is used unless the {product-title} cluster administrator explicitly defines that user in the {product-title}
identity provider and assigns the `admin` `*Role*` to the `admin` user.
====

Permissions for users in Jenkins can be changed in {product-title} after those users are initially established in Jenkins.  The OpenShift Login plugin polls the {product-title} API server for permissions and will update the permissions stored in
Jenkins for each Jenkins user with the permissions retrieved from {product-title}.  If the Jenkins UI is used to update permissions for a Jenkins user, the permission changes will be overwritten the next time the plugin polls {product-title}.

You can control how often the polling occurs with the `OPENSHIFT_PERMISSIONS_POLL_INTERVAL` environment variable.  The default polling interval when no environment variable is set is 5 minutes.

The following commands creates a new Jenkins xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#pods[pod] using {product-title} OAuth authentication,
assuming you have installed xref:../../install_config/imagestreams_templates.adoc[the default imagestreams and templates].

Run this command to use persistent volumes:
----
$ oc new-app jenkins-persistent
----

Run this command to use an EmptyDir type volume (configuration will not persist across pod restarts):
----
$ oc new-app jenkins-ephemeral
----

[NOTE]
====
If you instantiate the template against releases prior to v3.4 of {product-title}, standard Jenkins authentication will be used.  The default 'admin' account will exist with password 'password'.
See Jenkins standard authentication for details about changing this password.
====

==== Jenkins standard authentication

Jenkins authentication will be used by default with the {product-title} Jenkins images if the image is run outside of {product-title}.

The first time you start Jenkins, the configuration is created along with the administrator user and password.
The default user login is `*admin/password*`.
The default password can be configured by setting the `*JENKINS_PASSWORD*` environment variable when using (and only when using) standard Jenkins authentication.

The following command creates a new Jenkins xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#pods[pod] using standard Jenkins authentication:

----
$ oc new-app -e \
    JENKINS_PASSWORD=<password> \
    openshift/jenkins-1-centos7
----

=== Environment Variables

The Jenkins server can be configured with the following environment variables:

.Jenkins Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*JENKINS_PASSWORD*`
|Password for the `*admin*` user when using standard Jenkins authentication.  Not applicable when using {product-title} OAuth authentication.

|`*OPENSHIFT_ENABLE_OAUTH*`
|Determines whether the OpenShift Login plugin manages authentication when logging into Jenkins.  Enabled when set to any non-empty value other than "false".

|`*OPENSHIFT_PERMISSIONS_POLL_INTERVAL*`
|Specifies in seconds how often the OpenShift Login plugin polls {product-title} for the permissions associated with each user defined in Jenkins.

|===

=== Cross Project Access

If you are going to run Jenkins somewhere other than as a deployment within your same project you will need to provide an access token to Jenkins to access your project.

    1. Identify the service account token secret associated with a service account that has appropriate permissions to access the project Jenkins will need to access::

            $ oc describe serviceaccount default

        Example output:

            Name:       default
            Labels:     <none>
            Secrets:    {  default-token-uyswp    }
                        {  default-dockercfg-xcr3d    }
            Tokens:     default-token-izv1u
                        default-token-uyswp

        In this case the secret name is `default-token-uyswp`

    2. Retrieve the token from the secret:

            $ oc describe secret <secret name from above> # e.g. default-token-izv1u

        Example output:

            Name:       default-token-izv1u
            Labels:     <none>
            Annotations:    kubernetes.io/service-account.name=default,kubernetes.io/service-account.uid=32f5b661-2a8f-11e5-9528-3c970e3bf0b7
            Type:   kubernetes.io/service-account-token
            Data
            ====
            ca.crt: 1066 bytes
            token:  eyJhbGc..<content cut>....wRA

The token field contains the token value Jenkins will need to access the project.

=== Volume Mount Points
The Jenkins image can be run with mounted volumes to enable persistent storage for the configuration:

* *_/var/lib/jenkins_* - This is the data directory where Jenkins stores configuration files including job definitions.

== Creating a Jenkins Service from a Template

xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[Templates] provide parameter fields to
define all the environment variables (password) with predefined defaults.
{product-title} provides templates to make creating a new Jenkins service easy. The
Jenkins templates should have been registered in the default *openshift* project
by your cluster administrator during the initial cluster setup.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
See xref:../../install_config/imagestreams_templates.adoc#install-config-imagestreams-templates[Loading the Default Image Streams and Templates]
for more details, if required.
endif::[]

The two available templates both define a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configuration] and a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[service],
but differ in their storage strategy, which affects whether or not the Jenkins
content persists across a pod restart.

[NOTE]
====
A pod may be restarted when it is moved to another node, or when an update of the deployment configuration triggers a redeployment.
====

* `jenkins-ephemeral` uses ephemeral storage. On pod restart, all data is lost.
This template is useful for development or testing only.

* `jenkins-persistent` uses a persistent volume store. Data survives a pod
restart. To use a persistent volume store, the cluster administrator must
define a persistent volume pool in the {product-title} deployment.

Once selected, you must xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[instantiate] the template to be able to use Jenkins.

[[jenkins-as-s2i-builder]]
== Using Jenkins as a Source-To-Image builder

To customize the official {product-title} Jenkins image, you have two options:

* Use Docker layering.
* Use the image as a Source-To-Image builder, described here.

You can use xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#source-build[S2I]
to copy your custom Jenkins Jobs definitions, additional
plug-ins or replace the provided *_config.xml_* file with your own, custom, configuration.

In order to include your modifications in the Jenkins image, you need to have a Git
repository with the following directory structure:

*_plugins_*::
This directory contains those binary Jenkins plug-ins you want to copy into Jenkins.

*_plugins.txt_*::
This file lists the plug-ins you want to install:

----
pluginId:pluginVersion
----

*_configuration/jobs_*::
This directory contains the Jenkins job definitions.

*_configuration/config.xml_*::
This file contains your custom Jenkins configuration.

The contents of the *_configuration/_* directory will be copied
into the *_/var/lib/jenkins/_* directory, so you can also include
additional files, such as *_credentials.xml_*, there.

The following is an example build configuration that customizes the Jenkins
image in {product-title}:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
  name: custom-jenkins-build
spec:
  source:                       <1>
    git:
      uri: https://github.com/custom/repository
    type: Git
  strategy:                     <2>
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: jenkins:latest
        namespace: openshift
    type: Source
  output:                       <3>
    to:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: custom-jenkins:latest
----

<1> The `source` field defines the source Git repository
with the layout described above.
<2> The `strategy` field defines the original Jenkins image to use
as a source image for the build.
<3> The `output` field defines the resulting, customized Jenkins image
you can use in deployment configuration instead of the official Jenkins image.

[[using-the-jenkins-kubernetes-plug-in-to-run-jobs]]
== Using the Jenkins Kubernetes Plug-in to Run Jobs

The official {product-title} Jenkins image includes the pre-installed
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin[Kubernetes
plug-in] that allows Jenkins slaves to be dynamically provisioned on multiple
container hosts using Kubernetes and {product-title}.

To use the Kubernetes plug-in, {product-title} provides three images
suitable for use as Jenkins slaves: the *_Base_*, *_Maven_*, and *_NodeJS_* images.

The first is a https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/slave-base[base image] for Jenkins slaves:

 - It pulls in both the required tools (headless Java, the Jenkins JNLP client) and the useful ones
(including git, tar, zip, nss among others).
 - It establishes the JNLP slave agent as the entrypoint.
 - It includes the oc client tooling for invoking command line operations from within Jenkins jobs, and
 - It provides Dockerfiles for both Centos and RHEL images.

Two additional images, that extends the base image are also provided, namely:

* https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/slave-maven[Maven], and
* https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/slave-nodejs[NodeJS]

Both the Maven and NodeJS slave images are configured as Kubernetes Pod Tempate images within the {product-title} Jenkins image's
configuration for the Kubernetes plugin.  That configuration includes labels for each of the images that can
be applied to any of your Jenkins jobs under their "Restrict where this project can be run" setting. If the label is applied,
execution of the given job will be done under an {product-title} Pod running the respective slave image.

The Maven and NodeJS Jenkins slave images provide Dockerfiles for both Centos and RHEL that you can reference when building new slave images.
Also note the `contrib` and `contrib/bin` subdirectories.  They allow for the insertion of configuration files and executable
scripts for your image.

The Jenkins image also provides auto-discovery and auto-configuration
of slave images for the
Kubernetes plug-in. The Jenkins image searches for these in the existing image streams within the project that it is running in. The search specifically looks for image streams that have the label `role` set to `jenkins-slave`.

When it finds an image stream with this label, it generates the corresponding Kubernetes plug-in
configuration so you can assign your Jenkins
jobs to run in a pod running the container image provided by the image stream.

[NOTE]
====
This scanning is only performed once, when the Jenkins master is starting.
Please restart the Jenkins master if you label additional image streams(to pickup the added labels).
====

To use a container image as an Jenkins slave, the image must run the slave agent as
an entrypoint. For more details about this, refer to the official
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds#Distributedbuilds-Launchslaveagentheadlessly[Jenkins
documentation].


== Tutorial

For more details on the sample job included in this image, see this link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/README.md[tutorial].

== {product-title} Pipeline Plug-in

The Jenkins image's list of pre-installed plug-ins includes a plug-in which
assists in the creating of CI/CD workflows that run against an {product-title}
server.  A series of build steps, post-build actions, as well as SCM-style
polling are provided which equate to administrative and operational actions on
the {product-title} server and the API artifacts hosted there.

In addition to being accessible from the classic "freestyle" form of Jenkins
job, the build steps as of version 1.0.14 of the {product-title} Pipeline
Plug-in are also avaible to Jenkins Pipeline jobs via the DSL extension points
provided by the Jenkins Pipeline Plug-in. The https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/pipeline/samplepipeline.json[OpenShift Jenkins Pipeline build strategy sample]
illustrates how to use the OpenShift Pipeline plugin DSL versions of its steps.

The
https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/1/contrib/openshift/configuration/jobs/OpenShift%20Sample[sample
Jenkins job] that is pre-configured in the Jenkins image utilizes the
{product-title} pipeline plug-in and serves as an example of how to leverage the
plug-in for creating CI/CD flows for {product-title} in Jenkins.

See the https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-plugin/[the plug-in's README] for a detailed description of what is available.
