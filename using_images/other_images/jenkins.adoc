== Overview
OpenShift provides a Docker image for running Jenkins.  This image provides
a Jenkins server instance which can be used to setup continuous testing/integration/delivery
flows.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift provides version
https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/1[1.609] of Jenkins.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry via:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-1-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/jenkins-1-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these
registries or push them into your OpenShift docker registry. Additionally,
you can create an ImageStream that points to the image,
either in your docker registry or at the external location. Your OpenShift
resources can then reference the ImageStream. You can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example]
ImageStream definitions for all the provided OpenShift images.

== Configuration and Usage

=== Initializing Jenkins

The first time you start Jenkins, the configuration is created along with
the adminstrator user and password.  The default login is `*admin/password*`.
The default password can be configured by setting the `*JENKINS_PASSWORD*` environment
variable.

The following command creates a new Jenkins
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#pods[pod] with
Jenkins running in a container:

----
$ oc new-app -e \
    JENKINS_PASSWORD=<password> \
    openshift/jenkins-1-centos7
----

=== Environment Variables

The Jenkins password can be configured with the following environment variable:

.Jenkins Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*JENKINS_PASSWORD*`
|Password for the `*admin*` user.

|===


=== Volume Mount Points
The Jenkins image can be run with mounted volumes to enable persistent storage for
the configuration:

* *_/var/lib/jenkins_* - This is the data directory where Jenkins stores
configuration files including job definitions.

== Creating a Jenkins Service from a Template

OpenShift provides a link:../../dev_guide/templates.html[template] to make
creating a new Jenkins service easy. The template provides parameter fields to
define all the environment variables (password) with predefined defaults. It
will also define both a
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configuration] and a
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services[service].

The Jenkins templates should have been registered in the default *openshift*
project by your cluster administrator during the
link:../../install_config/install/first_steps.html[First Steps] setup process.
There are two templates available:

* `jenkins-ephemeral` is for development or testing purposes only because it uses
ephemeral storage for the Jenkins content. This means that if the Jenkins
pod is restarted for any reason, such as the pod being moved to another node
or the deployment configuration being updated and triggering a redeploy, all
data will be lost.
* `jenkins-persistent` uses a persistent volume store for the Jenkins content which
means the data will survive a pod restart. Using persistent volumes requires a
persistent volume pool be defined in the OpenShift deployment. Cluster
administrator instructions for setting up the pool are located
link:../../admin_guide/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_nfs.html[here].

You can find instructions for instantiating templates by following these
link:../../dev_guide/templates.html#creating-resources-from-a-template[instructions].

== Using Jenkins
The OpenShift Jenkins image provides a pre-defined job which implements a very basic build/test/promote flow.

The job will trigger a new build of a `*BuildConfig*` defined in OpenShift, test the output of that build,
and then retag the output to indicate it is ready for production.  For more details on this sample job, see
this link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/README.md[tutorial].
