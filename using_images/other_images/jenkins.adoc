== Overview
{product-title} provides a Docker image for running Jenkins.  This image provides a Jenkins server instance which can be used to set up a basic flow for continuous testing, integration, and delivery.

This image also includes a sample Jenkins job which triggers a new build of a `*BuildConfig*` defined in {product-title}, tests the output of that build, and then on successful build, retags the output to indicate the build is ready for production.

== Versions

{product-title} follows the https://jenkins.io/changelog-stable/[LTS] releases of Jenkins.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-1-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/jenkins-1-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these registries or push them into your {product-title} Docker registry.
Additionally, you can create an ImageStream that points to the image, either in your Docker registry or at the external location.
Your {product-title} resources can then reference the ImageStream.
You can find https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example] ImageStream definitions for all the provided {product-title} images.

== Configuration and Usage

=== Initializing Jenkins

The first time you start Jenkins, the configuration is created along with the administrator user and password.
The default login is `*admin/password*`.
The default password can be configured by setting the `*JENKINS_PASSWORD*` environment variable.

The following command creates a new Jenkins xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#pods[pod] with Jenkins running in a container:

----
$ oc new-app -e \
    JENKINS_PASSWORD=<password> \
    openshift/jenkins-1-centos7
----

=== Environment Variables

The Jenkins password can be configured with the following environment variable:

.Jenkins Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*JENKINS_PASSWORD*`
|Password for the `*admin*` user.

|===


=== Volume Mount Points
The Jenkins image can be run with mounted volumes to enable persistent storage for the configuration:

* *_/var/lib/jenkins_* - This is the data directory where Jenkins stores configuration files including job definitions.

== Creating a Jenkins Service from a Template

xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[Templates] provide parameter fields to
define all the environment variables (password) with predefined defaults.
{product-title} provides templates to make creating a new Jenkins service easy. The
Jenkins templates should have been registered in the default *openshift* project
by your cluster administrator during the initial cluster setup.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
See xref:../../install_config/imagestreams_templates.adoc#install-config-imagestreams-templates[Loading the Default Image Streams and Templates]
for more details, if required.
endif::[]

The two available templates both define a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configuration] and a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[service],
but differ in their storage strategy, which affects whether or not the Jenkins
content persists across a pod restart.

[NOTE]
====
A pod may be restarted when it is moved to another node, or when an update of the deployment configuration triggers a redeployment.
====

* `jenkins-ephemeral` uses ephemeral storage. On pod restart, all data is lost.
This template is useful for development or testing only.

* `jenkins-persistent` uses a persistent volume store. Data survives a pod
restart. To use a persistent volume store, the cluster administrator must
define a persistent volume pool in the {product-title} deployment.

Once selected, you must xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[instantiate] the template to be able to use Jenkins.

[[jenkins-as-s2i-builder]]
== Using Jenkins as a Source-To-Image builder

To customize the official {product-title} Jenkins image, you have two options:

* Use Docker layering.
* Use the image as a Source-To-Image builder, described here.

You can use xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#source-build[S2I]
to copy your custom Jenkins Jobs definitions, additional
plug-ins or replace the provided *_config.xml_* file with your own, custom, configuration.

In order to include your modifications in the Jenkins image, you need to have a Git
repository with the following directory structure:

*_plugins_*::
This directory contains those binary Jenkins plug-ins you want to copy into Jenkins.

*_plugins.txt_*::
This file lists the plug-ins you want to install (see the section above).

*_configuration/jobs_*::
This directory contains the Jenkins job definitions.

*_configuration/config.xml_*::
This file contains your custom Jenkins configuration.

The contents of the *_configuration/_* directory will be copied
into the *_/var/lib/jenkins/_* directory, so you can also include
additional files, such as *_credentials.xml_*, there.

The following is an example build configuration that customizes the Jenkins
image in {product-title}:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
  name: custom-jenkins-build
spec:
  source:                       <1>
    git:
      uri: https://github.com/custom/repository
    type: Git
  strategy:                     <2>
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: jenkins:latest
        namespace: openshift
    type: Source
  output:                       <3>
    to:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: custom-jenkins:latest
----

<1> The `source` field defines the source Git repository
with the layout described above.
<2> The `strategy` field defines the original Jenkins image to use
as a source image for the build.
<3> The `output` field defines the resulting, customized Jenkins image
you can use in deployment configuration instead of the official Jenkins image.

== Using the Jenkins Kubernetes Plug-in to Run Jobs

The official {product-title} Jenkins image includes the pre-installed
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin[Kubernetes
plug-in] that allows Jenkins slaves to be dynamically provisioned on multiple
Docker hosts using Kubernetes and {product-title}.

The Jenkins image entrypoint also provides auto-discovery and auto-configuration
of the Kubernetes plug-ins by scanning the project Jenkins is deployed in for
existing image streams with the label *role* set to *jenkins-slave*.

When an image stream with this label is found, the entrypoint generates the
corresponding Kubernetes plug-in configuration so you can assign your Jenkins
jobs to run in a pod running the Docker image provided by the image stream.

To use a Docker image as an Jenkins slave, the image must run the slave agent as
an entrypoint. For more details about this, refer to the official
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds#Distributedbuilds-Launchslaveagentheadlessly[Jenkins
documentation].

Alternatively, you can use
https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins-master/jenkins-slave-template.json[a
provided {product-title} template] to convert an existing image stream to a Jenkins
slave.

== Tutorial

For more details on the sample job included in this image, see this link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/README.md[tutorial].

== {product-title} Pipeline Plug-in

The Jenkins image's list of pre-installed plug-ins includes a plug-in which
assists in the creating of CI/CD workflows that run against an {product-title}
server.  A series of build steps, post-build actions, as well as SCM-style
polling are provided which equate to administrative and operational actions on
the {product-title} server and the API artifacts hosted there.

In addition to being accessible from the classic "freestyle" form of Jenkins
job, the build steps as of version 1.0.14 of the {product-title} Pipeline
Plug-in are also avaible to Jenkins Pipeline jobs via the DSL extension points
provided by the Jenkins Pipeline Plug-in.

The
https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/1/contrib/openshift/configuration/jobs/OpenShift%20Sample[sample
Jenkins job] that is pre-configured in the Jenkins image utilizes the
{product-title} pipeline plug-in and serves as an example of how to leverage the
plug-in for creating CI/CD flows for {product-title} in Jenkins.

See the https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-plugin/[the plug-in's README] for a detailed description of what is available.
