== Overview
OpenShift provides a Docker image for running Jenkins.  This image provides a Jenkins server instance which can be used to set up a basic flow for continuous testing, integration, and delivery.

This image also includes a sample Jenkins job which triggers a new build of a `*BuildConfig*` defined in OpenShift, tests the output of that build, and then on successful build, retags the output to indicate the build is ready for production.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift provides version
https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/1[1.609] of Jenkins.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-1-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/jenkins-1-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these registries or push them into your OpenShift Docker registry.
Additionally, you can create an ImageStream that points to the image, either in your Docker registry or at the external location.
Your OpenShift resources can then reference the ImageStream.
You can find https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example] ImageStream definitions for all the provided OpenShift images.

== Configuration and Usage

=== Initializing Jenkins

The first time you start Jenkins, the configuration is created along with the administrator user and password.
The default login is `*admin/password*`.
The default password can be configured by setting the `*JENKINS_PASSWORD*` environment variable.

The following command creates a new Jenkins link:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#pods[pod] with Jenkins running in a container:

----
$ oc new-app -e \
    JENKINS_PASSWORD=<password> \
    openshift/jenkins-1-centos7
----

=== Environment Variables

The Jenkins password can be configured with the following environment variable:

.Jenkins Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*JENKINS_PASSWORD*`
|Password for the `*admin*` user.

|===


=== Volume Mount Points
The Jenkins image can be run with mounted volumes to enable persistent storage for the configuration:

* *_/var/lib/jenkins_* - This is the data directory where Jenkins stores configuration files including job definitions.

== Creating a Jenkins Service from a Template

link:../../dev_guide/templates.html[Templates] provide parameter fields to
define all the environment variables (password) with predefined defaults.
OpenShift provides templates to make creating a new Jenkins service easy. The
Jenkins templates should have been registered in the default *openshift* project
by your cluster administrator during the initial cluster setup.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
See link:../../install_config/install/first_steps.html[First Steps] for more
details, if required.
endif::[]

The two available templates both define a
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configuration] and a
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services[service],
but differ in their storage strategy, which affects whether or not the Jenkins
content persists across a pod restart.

[NOTE]
====
A pod may be restarted when it is moved to another node, or when an update of the deployment configuration triggers a redeployment.
====

* `jenkins-ephemeral` uses ephemeral storage. On pod restart, all data is lost.
This template is useful for development or testing only.

* `jenkins-persistent` uses a persistent volume store. Data survives a pod
restart. To use a persistent volume store, the cluster administrator must
define a persistent volume pool in the OpenShift deployment.

Once selected, you must link:../../dev_guide/templates.html#creating-resources-from-a-template[instantiate] the template to be able to use Jenkins.

== Customizing Jenkins image

=== Using Jenkins image as Source-To-Image builder

The Source-To-Image strategy allows you to do additional modifications to the Jenkins
image. For example, you can use
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[Source-To-Image]
to copy your Jenkins jobs definitions, additional plugins or tweak the default
configuration if you want.

To do that, you can define a build configuration that uses the Jenkins image as
a builder image:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: "BuildConfig"
apiVersion: "v1"
metadata:
  name: "custom-jenkins-build" <1>
spec:
  triggers: <2>
    -
      type: "ImageChange"
  source: <3>
    type: "Git"
    git:
      uri: "git://github.com/<org>/<repository-name>.git"
  strategy: <4>
    type: "Source"
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: "ImageStreamTag"
        name: "jenkins:latest"
  output: <5>
    to:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "custom-jenkins:latest"
----

<1> This specification will create a new `*BuildConfig*` named *custom-jenkins-build*.
<2> The ImageChange trigger will rebuild the custom Jenkins image when the official Jenkins image is updated.
<3> The source repository that contains custom Jenkins configuration, plugins, jobs, etc.
<4> The "Source" strategy uses the official Jenkins image as the builder.

The source repository must have the following layout:

* `./plugins` - directory that contains binary Jenkins plugins you want to install.
* `./plugins.txt` - file that lists additional plugins you want to install in the `plugin:version` format.
* `./configuration/jobs` - directory that contains user-defined Jenkins job definitions.
* `./configuration/config.xml` - file that contains your custom Jenkins configuration.

Note that the content of the `./configuration` directory will be copied into the
`/var/lib/jenkins` directory, so you can include any additional configuration
file there.

=== Using Jenkins Kubernetes plugin to run jobs

The official OpenShift Jenkins includes the pre-installed
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin[Kubernetes
Plugin] that allows Jenkins slaves to be dynamically provisioned on multiple
Docker hosts using Kubernetes and OpenShift.

The Jenkins image entrypoint also provides auto-discovery and auto-configuration
of the Kubernetes plugins by scanning the project Jenkins is deployed in for
existing image streams with the label `role` set to `jenkins-slave`.

When an image stream with this label is found, the entrypoint will generate the
corresponding Kubernetes plugin configuration so you can simply assign your
Jenkins jobs to run in a Pod running the Docker image provided by the image
stream.

To use a Docker image as an Jenkins slave, the image has to run the slave agent
as an entrypoint. For more details about this, refer to the official
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds#Distributedbuilds-Launchslaveagentheadlessly[Jenkins
documentation]. 

Alternatively, you can use
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins-master/jenkins-slave-template.json[this]
provided OpenShift template, to convert an existing image stream to a Jenkins
slave.

== OpenShift Pipeline Plugin

The Jenkins image's list of pre-installed plugins includes a plugin which assists in the creating of CI/CD workflows that run against
an OpenShift server.  A series of build steps, post-build actions, as well as SCM-style polling are provided which equate to administrative
and operational actions on the OpenShift server and the API artifacts hosted there.

The https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/1/contrib/openshift/configuration/jobs/OpenShift%20Sample[sample Jenkins job] that is pre-configured in the Jenkins image utilizes the OpenShift pipeline plugin and serves as an example of
how to leverage the plugin for creating CI/CD flows for OpenShift in Jenkins.

See the https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-plugin/[the plugin's README] for a detailed description of what is available.
