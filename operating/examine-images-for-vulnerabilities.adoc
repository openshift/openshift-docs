[role="_abstract"]
With {product-title}, you can analyze images for vulnerabilities using the {product-title-short} Scanner V4, or you can xref:../integration/integrate-with-image-vulnerability-scanners.adoc#integrate-with-image-vulnerability-scanners[configure an integration] to use another supported scanner.

{product-title-short} scanners analyze each image layer to find packages and match them against known vulnerabilities by comparing them with a vulnerability database populated from different sources. These sources include Red{nbsp}Hat Vulnerability Exchange (VEX), the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), the Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV) database, and operating system vulnerability feeds.

[NOTE]
====
{product-title-short} uses the OSV database available at link:https://osv.dev/[OSV.dev] under link:https://github.com/google/osv.dev/blob/master/LICENSE[Apache License 2.0].
====

{product-title-short} contains two scanners: Scanner V4 and the StackRox Scanner.

Scanner V4, built on Claircore, is the default scanner as of release 4.8. The StackRox Scanner, which originates from a fork of the Clair v2 open source scanner, is deprecated.

[NOTE]
====
When this documentation uses the term "{product-title-short} scanner" or "Scanner", it refers to Scanner V4.
====

When the {product-title-short} scanner finds any vulnerabilities, it performs the following actions:

* Shows them in the xref:../operating/manage-vulnerabilities/common-vuln-management-tasks.adoc#common-vuln-management-tasks[*Vulnerability Management*] view for detailed analysis
* Ranks vulnerabilities according to risk and highlights them in the {product-title-short} portal for risk assessment
* Checks them against enabled xref:../operating/manage_security_policies/about-security-policies.adoc#about-security-policies[security policies]

The {product-title-short} scanner inspects the images and identifies the installed components based on the files in the images.
It might fail to identify installed components or vulnerabilities if the final images are modified to remove the following files:

//About Scanner V4

[id="enabling_scanner_v4_{context}"]
== Enabling Scanner V4

Scanner V4 is enabled by default when {product-title-short} is newly installed. However, if you have not previously enabled Scanner V4 and are upgrading from version 4.7 or earlier, you must enable it explicitly during the upgrade to use it. For more information, see the following sections.

[id="enabling-scanner-v4-after-installation-operator_{context}"]
=== Enabling Scanner V4 after installing by using the Operator

To use Scanner V4, you can enable it after installation on the cluster where Central is installed and on secured clusters.

[id="enabling-scanner-v4-after-installation-helm_{context}"]
=== Enabling Scanner V4 after installing by using Helm

To use Scanner V4, you can enable it after installation on the cluster where Central is installed and on secured clusters.

[id="installing-and-configuring-scanning-on-secured-clusters_{context}"]
=== Installing and configuring Scanner-slim on secured clusters

[id="using-the-operator_{context}"]
==== Using the Operator

{product-title-short} Operator installs a Scanner-slim version on each secured cluster to scan images in the {ocp} integrated registry and optionally other registries.

For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_ocp/install-secured-cluster-ocp.adoc#installing-sc-operator[Installing {product-title-short} on secured clusters by using the Operator].


[id="using-helm_{context}"]
==== Using Helm

Secured Cluster Services Helm chart (`secured-cluster-services`) installs a Scanner-slim version on each secured cluster.
In Kubernetes, the secured cluster services include Scanner-slim.
On {ocp}, however, {product-title-short} installs a Scanner-slim version on each secured cluster to scan images in the {ocp} integrated registry and optionally other registries.

* For {ocp} installations, see xref:../installing/installing_ocp/install-secured-cluster-ocp.adoc#installing-secured-cluster-services-quickly_install-secured-cluster-ocp[Installing the secured-cluster-services Helm chart without customization].

* For non-{ocp} installations, such as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (Google GKE), and Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (Microsoft AKS), see xref:../installing/installing_other/install-secured-cluster-other.adoc#installing-secured-cluster-services-quickly_install-secured-cluster-other[Installing the secured-cluster-services Helm chart without customization].

[id="verifying-after-installation_{context}"]
==== Verifying after installation

.Procedure

* Verify that the status of the secured cluster indicates that Scanner is present and healthy:
.. In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Platform Configuration -> Clusters*.
.. In the *Clusters* view, select a cluster to view its details.
.. In the *Health Status* card, ensure that *Scanner* is present and is marked as *Healthy.*

[id="using-image-scanning_{context}"]
==== Using image scanning

You can scan images stored in a cluster specific {ocp} integrated image registry by using `roxctl` CLI, Jenkins, and API. You can specify the appropriate cluster in the delegated scanning configuration or use the cluster parameter available in `roxctl` CLI, Jenkins, and API.

For more information about how to scan images by using the `roxctl` CLI, see xref:../cli/image-scanning-by-using-the-roxctl-cli.adoc#image-scanning-by-using-the-roxctl-cli[Image scanning by using the roxctl CLI].

[id="setting-up-scanning_{context}"]
== Setting up scanning

You can configure settings for scanning, such as automatic scanning of active and inactive images.

== About vulnerabilities

//Removed a lot of "additional resources" and added link below to the vulnerability management chapter, common vulnerability management tasks

{product-title-short} fetches vulnerability definitions and updates from multiple vulnerability feeds. These feeds are both general in nature, such as NVD, or distribution-specific, such as Alpine, Debian, and Ubuntu. For more information on viewing and addressing vulnerabilities that are found, see xref:../operating/manage-vulnerabilities/vulnerability-management.adoc#vulnerability-management[Vulnerability management].
