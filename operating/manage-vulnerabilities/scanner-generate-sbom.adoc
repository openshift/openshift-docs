You can use {product-title-short} to generate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from scanned container images.

:FeatureName: Generation of SBOMs from the scanned container images
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

Scanner V4 must be enabled to generate SBOMs. For information about enabling Scanner V4, see the following resources:

* For {ocp}:
** xref:../../installing/installing_ocp/install-central-ocp.adoc#install-central-operator_install-central-ocp[Installing Central using the Operator method]
** xref:../../installing/installing_ocp/install-central-ocp.adoc#central-services-public-configuration-file-scannerv4_install-central-ocp[Scanner V4] (Helm installation)
* For Kubernetes:
** xref:../../installing/installing_other/install-central-other.adoc#central-services-public-configuration-file-scannerv4_install-central-other[Scanner V4] (Helm installation)

SBOMs give you a detailed overview of software components, dependencies, and libraries within your application. {product-title-short} uses the results of scans performed by Scanner V4 to generate an SBOM. You can generate an SBOM by using the {product-title-short} portal, the `roxctl` CLI, or the {product-title-short} API.

[NOTE]
====
Scanner V4 cannot generate SBOMs from results of delegated scans. In delegated scanning, you are using your secured cluster to index images and sending data to Central for vulnerability matching. SBOM generation is only available when using Scanner V4 configured in Central.
