[role="_abstract"]

Historically, {product-title-short} has provided a view of vulnerabilities discovered in your system in the vulnerability management dashboard. With the dashboard, you can view vulnerabilities by image, node, or platform. You can also view vulnerabilities by clusters, namespaces, deployments, node components, and image components. The dashboard is deprecated in {product-title-short} 4.5 and will be removed in a future release.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To perform actions on vulnerabilities, such as view additional information about a vulnerability, defer a vulnerability, or mark a vulnerability as a false positive, go to *Vulnerability Management* -> *Results* and click the *User Workloads* tab. To review requests for deferring and marking CVEs as false positives, click *Vulnerability Management* -> *Exception Management*.
