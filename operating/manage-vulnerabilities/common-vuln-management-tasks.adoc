Common vulnerability management tasks involve identifying and prioritizing vulnerabilities, remedying them, and monitoring for new threats.

== Viewing vulnerabilities

Historically, {product-title-short} provided a view of vulnerabilities discovered in your system in the vulnerability management dashboard. The dashboard is deprecated in {product-title-short} 4.5 and will be removed in a future release. For more information about the dashboard, see xref:../../operating/manage-vulnerabilities/vulnerability-management-dashboard.adoc#vulnerability-management-dashboard[Using the vulnerability management dashboard].

The *Vulnerability Management* -> *Workload CVEs* page provides information about vulnerabilities in applications running on clusters in your system. You can view vulnerability information across images and deployments. The *Workload CVEs* page provides advanced filtering capabilities, including the ability to view images and deployments with vulnerabilities and filter by image, deployment, namespace, cluster, CVE, component, and component source.

== Excluding CVEs

You can exclude or ignore CVEs in {product-title-short} by snoozing node and platform CVEs and deferring or marking node, platform, and image CVEs as false positives. You might want to exclude CVEs if you know that the CVE is a false positive or you have already taken steps to mitigate the CVE. Snoozed CVEs do not appear in vulnerability reports or trigger policy violations.

You can snooze a CVE to globally ignore it for a specified period of time. Snoozing a CVE does not require approval.

[NOTE]
====
Snoozing node and platform CVEs requires enabling the ROX_VULN_MGMT_LEGACY_SNOOZE environment variable.
====

Deferring or marking a CVE as a false positive is done through the exception management workflow. This workflow provides the ability to view pending, approved, and denied deferral and false positive requests. You can scope the CVE exception to a single image, all tags for a single image, or globally across all images.

When approving or denying a request, you must add a comment. A CVE remains in the observed status until the exception request is approved. A pending request for deferral that is denied by another user is still visible in reports, policy violations, and other places in the system, but is indicated by a *Pending exception* label next to the CVE when visiting *Vulnerability Management* -> *Workload CVEs*.

An approved exception for a deferral or false positive has the following effects:

* Removes the CVE from the *Observed* tab in *Vulnerability Management* -> *Workflow CVEs* to either the *Deferred* or *False positive* tab
* Prevents the CVE from triggering policy violations that are related to the CVE
* Prevents the CVE from showing up in automatically generated vulnerability reports
