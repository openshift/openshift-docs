For {ocp}, Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) is the only supported operating system for control plane. Whereas, for node hosts, {ocp} supports both RHCOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).
With {rh-rhacscs-first}, you can scan RHCOS nodes for vulnerabilities and detect potential security threats.

{product-title-short} scans RHCOS RPMs installed on the node host, as part of the RHCOS installation, for any known vulnerabilities.

First, {product-title-short} analyzes and detects RHCOS components, and then it matches vulnerabilities for identified components using Red Hat RHEL and OpenShift 4.X Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) v2 security data streams.

[NOTE]
====
* Red Hat supports scanning for RHCOS nodes only if you are using it with {ocp}.
* You must use {ocp} 4.10 or later for scanning RHCOS node hosts.
