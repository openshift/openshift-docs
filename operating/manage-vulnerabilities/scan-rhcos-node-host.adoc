[role="_abstract"]
For {ocp}, {op-system-first} is the only supported operating system for control plane. For node hosts, {ocp} supports both {op-system} and {op-system-base-full}.
With {rh-rhacs-first}, you can scan {op-system} nodes for vulnerabilities and detect potential security threats.

{product-title-short} scans {op-system} RPMs installed on the node host, as part of the {op-system} installation, for any known vulnerabilities.

First, {product-title-short} analyzes and detects {op-system} components. Then it matches vulnerabilities for identified components by using {op-system-base} and the following data streams:

* OpenShift 4.X Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) v2 security data streams is used if StackRox Scanner is used for node scanning.
* Red{nbsp}Hat Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) is used if Scanner V4 is used for node scanning.

[NOTE]
====
* If you installed {product-title-short} by using the `roxctl` CLI, you must manually enable the {op-system} node scanning features. When you use Helm or Operator installation methods on {ocp}, this feature is enabled by default.
