Learn how to use the *Configuration Management* view and understand the correlation between various entities in your cluster to manage your cluster configuration efficiently.

Every {ocp} cluster includes many different entities distributed throughout the cluster, which makes it more challenging to understand and act on the available information.

{product-title} (RHACS) provides efficient configuration management that combines all these distributed entities on a single page.
It brings together information about all your clusters, namespaces, nodes, deployments, images, secrets, users, groups, service accounts, and roles in a single *Configuration Management* view, helping you visualize different entities and the connections between them.
