[role="_abstract"]
Collector runtime configuration enables you to modify some collector behaviors without restarting Collector. Collector runtime configuration is set using a `ConfigMap` object called `collector-config`. When you create or update the `ConfigMap` object, Collector refreshes the runtime configuration. When you delete the `ConfigMap` object, the settings revert to the default runtime configuration values.

Currently, only two settings are controlled by using Collector runtime configuration:

* `networking.externalIps.enabled` controls if the visualizing external entities feature is enabled or disabled. The default is `DISABLED`. In release 4.6, this setting was `networking.externalIps.enable` and was a boolean. For more information, see xref:../operating/visualizing-external-entities.adoc#visualizing-external-entities[Visualizing external entities].

* `networking.maxConnectionsPerMinute` is the maximum number of open networking connections reported by Collector per container per minute. The default value is 2048.

The following example enables the visualizing external entities feature and sets `maxConnectionsPerMinute` to 2048.
