You can use {product-title} ({product-title-short}) to ensure the integrity of the container images in your clusters by verifying image signatures against pre-configured keys.

You can create policies to block unsigned images and images that do not have a verified signature.
You can also enforce the policy by using the {product-title-short} admission controller to stop unauthorized deployment creation.

[NOTE]
====
* {product-title-short} supports Cosign signature verification by using Cosign public keys, Cosign certificates, or both.
+
For more information about Cosign, see link:https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/signing/overview/[Overview] (Sigstore documentation).
* For Cosign signature verification, {product-title-short} supports communication with the transparency log. 
+
For more information, see link:https://docs.sigstore.dev/logging/overview/[Rekor] (Sigstore documentation).
* For Cosign signature verification, you can use keyless verification with {product-title-short}. If you want to host the key infrastructure yourself, you can do this by using {rh-rhtas-first}.
* You must configure signature integration with at least 1 Cosign verification method for signature verification.
* For all deployed and watched images:
** {product-title-short} fetches and verifies the signatures every 4 hours.
** {product-title-short} verifies the signatures whenever you change or update your signature integration verification data.

== Enforcing signature verification
To prevent the users from using unsigned images, you can enforce signature verification by using the {product-title-short} admission controller.
You must first enable the *Contact Image Scanners* feature in your cluster configuration settings.
Then, while creating a security policy to enforce signature verification, you can use the *Inform and enforce* option.

For more information, see xref:../operating/use-admission-controller-enforcement.adoc#enable-admission-controller-enforcement_use-admission-controller-enforcement[Enabling admission controller enforcement].
