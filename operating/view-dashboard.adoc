[role="_abstract"]
The {rh-rhacscs-first} Dashboard provides quick access to the data you need. It contains additional navigation shortcuts and actionable widgets that are easy to filter and customize so that you can focus on the data that matters most to you. You can view information about levels of risk in your environment, compliance status, policy violations, and common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) in images.

[NOTE]
====
When you open the {product-title-short} portal for the first time, the Dashboard might be empty. After you deploy Sensor in at least one cluster, the Dashboard reflects the status of your environment.
====

The following sections describe the Dashboard components.

[id="status-bar-links"]
== Status bar

The *Status Bar* provides at-a-glance numerical counters for key resources. The counters reflect what is visible with your current access scope that is defined by the roles associated with your user profile. These counters are clickable, providing fast access to desired list view pages as follows:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Counter | Destination

| Clusters
| Platform Configuration -> Clusters

| Nodes
| Configuration Management -> Application & Infrastructure → Nodes

| Violations
| Violations main menu

| Deployments
| Configuration Management -> Application & Infrastructure → Deployments

| Images
| Vulnerability Management -> Dashboard -> Images

| Secrets
| Configuration Management -> Application & Infrastructure -> Secrets
|===

[id="dashboard-filter"]
== Dashboard filter

The Dashboard includes a top-level filter that applies simultaneously to all widgets. You can select one or more clusters, and one or more namespaces within selected clusters. When no clusters or namespaces are selected, the view automatically switches to *All*. Any change to the filter is immediately reflected by all widgets, limiting the data they present to the selected scope. The Dashboard filter does not affect the *Status Bar*.

[id="widget-options"]
== Widget options

Some widgets are customizable to help you focus on specific data. Widgets offer different controls that you can use to change how the data is sorted, filter the data, and customize the output of the widget.

Widgets offer two ways to customize different aspects:

* An *Options* menu, when present, provides specific options applicable to that widget.
* A *dynamic axis legend*, when present, provides a method to filter data by hiding one or more of the axis categories. For example, in the *Policy violations by category* widget, you can click on a severity to include or exclude violations of a selected severity from the data.

[NOTE]
====
Individual widget customization settings are short-lived and are reset to the system default upon leaving the Dashboard.
====

[id="new-widgets"]
== Actionable widgets

The following sections describe the actionable widgets available in the Dashboard.

[id="policy-violations-severity"]
=== Policy violations by severity

This widget shows the distribution of violations across severity levels for the Dashboard-filtered scope. Clicking a *severity level* in the chart takes you to the *Violations* page, filtered for that severity and scope. It also lists the three most recent violations of a *Critical* level policy within the scope you defined in the Dashboard filter. Clicking a specific violation takes you directly to the *Violations* detail page for that violation.

[id="images-most-risk"]
=== Images at most risk

This widget lists the top six vulnerable images within the Dashboard-filtered scope, sorted by their computed risk priority, along with the number of critical and important CVEs they contain. Click on an image name to go directly to the *Image Findings* page under *Vulnerability Management*. Use the *Options* menu to focus on fixable CVEs, or further focus on active images.

[NOTE]
====
When clusters or namespaces have been selected in the Dashboard filter, the data displayed is already filtered to active images, or images that are used by deployments within the filtered scope.
====

[id="deployments-most-risk"]
=== Deployments at most risk

This widget provides information about the top deployments at risk in your environment. It displays additional information such as the resource location (cluster and namespace) and the risk priority score. Additionally, you can click on a deployment to view risk information about the deployment; for example, its policy violations and vulnerabilities.

[id="aging-images"]
=== Aging images

Older images present a higher security risk because they can contain vulnerabilities that have already been addressed. If older images are active, they can expose deployments to exploits. You can use this widget to quickly assess your security posture and identify offending images. You can use the default ranges or customize the age intervals with your own values. You can view both inactive and active images or use the Dashboard filter to focus on a particular area for active images. You can then click on an age group in this widget to view only those images in the *Vulnerability Management* -> *Images* page.

[id="policy-violations-category"]
=== Policy violations by category

This widget can help you gain insights about the challenges your organization is facing in complying with security policies, by analyzing which types of policies are violated more than others. The widget shows the five policy categories of highest interest. Explore the *Options* menu for different ways to slice the data. You can filter the data to focus exclusively on deploy or runtime violations.

You can also change the sorting mode. By default, the data is sorted by the number of violations within the highest severity first. Therefore, all categories with critical policies will appear before categories without critical policies. The other sorting mode considers the total number of violations regardless of severity. Because some categories contain no critical policies (for example, “Docker CIS”), the two sorting modes can provide significantly different views, offering additional insight.

Click on a severity level at the bottom of the graph to include or exclude that level from the data. Selecting different severity levels can result in a different top five selection or ranking order. Data is filtered to the scope selected by the Dashboard filter.

[id="compliance-standard"]
=== Compliance by standard

You can use the *Compliance by standard* widget with the Dashboard filter to focus on areas that matter to you the most. The widget lists the top or bottom six compliance benchmarks, depending on sort order. Select *Options* to sort by the coverage percentage. Click on one of the benchmark labels or graphs to go directly to the *Compliance Controls* page, filtered by the Dashboard scope and the selected benchmark.

[NOTE]
====
The *Compliance* widget shows details only after you run a xref:../operating/manage-compliance.adoc#run-compliance-scan_manage-compliance[compliance scan].
