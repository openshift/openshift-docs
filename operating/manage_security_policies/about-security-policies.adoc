{product-title} ({product-title-short}) helps you secure your container infrastructure by using a robust policy engine and an admission controller. With {product-title-short}, you can establish appropriate security guardrails, inform about policy violations, and selectively enforce policies to prevent insecure situations. 

Specifically, {product-title-short} can help you fail the CI pipeline in the build stage, reject deployments from being deployed in the deployment stage, and shut down running deployments that violate runtime policies. {product-title-short} also provides policy management and violation management tools described in the following sections.
