{product-title-short} works with link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/[Kubernetes admission controllers] and link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.19/architecture/admission-plug-ins.html[{ocp} admission plugins] to allow you to enforce security policies before Kubernetes or {ocp} creates workloads, for example, deployments, daemon sets or jobs.
