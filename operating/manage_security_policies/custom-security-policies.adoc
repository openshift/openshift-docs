In addition to using the default policies, you can also create custom policies in {product-title}.

You can create custom policies by using the following methods:

* In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Platform configuration* -> *Policy management* and click *Create policy*.
* In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Risk* and use the filter to select the criteria that you want the policy to use. Click *Create policy*.
* Create and manage policies as code by saving policies as Kubernetes custom resources (CRs) and by applying them to clusters using a continuous delivery tool such as Argo CD.
