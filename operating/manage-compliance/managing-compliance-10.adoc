By using {product-title} you can assess, check, and report on the compliance status of your containerized infrastructure.
You can run out-of-the-box compliance scans based on industry standards including:

* *CIS Benchmarks* (Center for Internet Security) for *Docker* and *Kubernetes*
* *HIPAA* (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
* *NIST Special Publication 800-190* and *800-53* (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
* *PCI DSS* (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
* *OpenSCAP* (Open Security Content Automation Protocol): Available in {product-title-short} for {ocp} clusters when the Compliance Operator is installed and configured to provide results to {product-title-short} 

By scanning your environment based on these standards you can:

* Evaluate your infrastructure for regulatory compliance.
* Harden your Docker Engine and Kubernetes orchestrator.
* Understand and manage the overall security posture of your environment.
* Get a detailed view of compliance status for clusters, namespaces, and nodes.

//TODO: See xref:#benchmark-versions/[Benchmark version] for detailed information about the benchmark versions that {product-title} supports.

== Viewing compliance scan results

After you run a compliance scan, the compliance dashboard displays the results as the compliance status for your environment.
You can view compliance violations directly from the dashboard, filter the details view, and drill down compliance standards to understand if your environment is compliant against specific benchmarks.
This section explains how to view and filter compliance scan results.

You can use shortcuts to check the compliance status of clusters, namespaces, and nodes.
Look for these shortcuts on the top of your compliance dashboard.
By clicking these shortcuts you can view the compliance snapshot and generate reports on the overall compliance of your clusters, namespaces, or nodes.
