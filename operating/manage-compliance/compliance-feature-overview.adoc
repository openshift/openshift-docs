The compliance feature ensures that your Kubernetes clusters adhere to industry standards and regulatory requirements. It provides automated compliance checks that enable you to continuously monitor your clusters against predefined benchmarks such as CIS, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and so on. 

The feature includes detailed reports and remediation guidance to help administrators quickly identify and resolve compliance issues. You can view the compliance results associated with your cluster by using the compliance feature in the {rh-rhacs-first} portal.

The compliance feature summarizes information into the following sections:

Dashboard:: Formerly known as _Compliance 1.0_, summarizes the compliance information collected from all your clusters. It covers workload and infrastructure compliance.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
By running a compliance scan in {product-title-short}, you can monitor the entire Kubernetes infrastructure and workloads and ensure that they meet the required standards. You can use the compliance dashboard for filtering and detailed reporting.

For more information, see xref:../../operating/manage-compliance/monitoring-workload-and-cluster-compliance.adoc#monitoring-workload-and-cluster-compliance[Monitoring workload and cluster compliance].
====

OpenShift Schedules and OpenShift Coverage:: Formerly known as _Compliance 2.0_, summarizes the compliance information in a single  interface after the scheduled scans by using the Compliance Operator.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
* If you have {osp} clusters with the Compliance Operator installed, you can create and manage compliance scan schedules directly in {product-title-short} on the schedules page. The coverage page shows you the scan results associated with a benchmark and profile in a single interface.

* You can now use the new OpenShift Infrastructure Compliance feature to assess compliance across your entire OpenShift cluster fleet and ensure consistent adherence to the security policies of your organization. {product-title-short} now generates reports even if some clusters in a scheduled scan fail, so that you can maintain visibility into the compliance status of successfully scanned clusters without data gaps.
