By performing compliance scans, you can check the compliance status of your entire infrastructure in {product-title-short}. You can view the results in the compliance dashboard, where you can filter data and monitor compliance status across clusters, namespaces and nodes.

By generating detailed compliance reports and focusing on specific standards, controls and industry benchmarks, you can track and share the compliance status of your environment, and ensure that your infrastructure meets the required compliance standards.
