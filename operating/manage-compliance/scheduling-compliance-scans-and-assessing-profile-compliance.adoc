:FeatureName: Scheduling compliance scans and assessing profile compliance
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

You can create and manage compliance scan schedules on the schedules page that meet your operational needs. You can only have one schedule that scans the same profile on the same cluster.

By viewing and filtering the scan results on the coverage page, you can monitor the compliance status across all clusters.
