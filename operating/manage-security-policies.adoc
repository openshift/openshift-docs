{product-title} allows you to use out-of-the-box security policies and define custom multi-factor policies for your container environment.
Configuring these policies enables you to automatically prevent high-risk service deployments in your environment and respond to runtime security incidents.

== Creating and managing policy categories

You can create and manage policy categories by using the following methods:

* Create a policy category in the *Policy details* section when you create a policy. The category names are stored as strings that are attached to the policy and cannot be copied or deleted.
* Create, copy, or delete a policy category by navigating to *Platform Configuration* -> *Policy Management* and clicking the *Policy categories* tab. The policy categories are stored in the database and can be managed. This option is available only in {product-title-managed} or in {product-title-short} if you have the PostgreSQL database (Technology Preview) enabled.

[id="create-custom-policies"]
== Creating custom policies

In addition to using the default policies, you can also create custom policies in {product-title}.

To build a new policy, you can clone an existing policy or create a new one from scratch.

* You can also create policies based on the filter criteria in the *Risk* view in the {product-title-short} portal.
* You can also use `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` logical operators for policy criteria to create advanced policies.

[id="share-security-policies"]
== Sharing security policies

Beginning from {product-title} version 3.0.44,  you can share your security policies between different Central instances, by exporting and importing policies.
It helps you enforce the same standards for all your clusters.
To share policies, you export them as JSON files, and then import them back into another Central instance.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, you cannot export multiple security policies at once by using the RHACS portal.
However, you can use the API for exporting multiple security policies.
On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Help* -> *API reference* to see the API reference.
