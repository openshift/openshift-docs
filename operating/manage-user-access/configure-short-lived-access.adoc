{rh-rhacs-first} provides the ability to configure short-lived access to the user interface and API calls.

You can configure this by exchanging OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity tokens for a {product-title-short}-issued token.

We recommend this especially for Continuous Integration (CI) usage, where short-lived access is preferable over long-lived API tokens.

The following steps outline the high-level workflow on how to configure short-lived access to the user interface and API calls:

. Configuring {product-title-short} to trust OIDC identity token issuers for exchanging short-lived {product-title-short}-issued tokens.
. Exchanging an OIDC identity token for a short-lived {product-title-short}-issued token by calling the API.
