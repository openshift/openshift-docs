If you use an enterprise certificate authority (CA) for authentication, you can configure {product-title} (RHACS) to authenticate users by using their personal certificates.

After you configure PKI authentication, users and API clients can log in using their personal certificates.
Users without certificates can still use other authentication options, including API tokens, the local administrator password, or other authentication providers.
PKI authentication is available on the same port number as the Web UI, gRPC, and REST APIs.

When you configure PKI authentication, by default, {product-title} uses the same port for PKI, web UI, gRPC, other single sign-on (SSO) providers, and REST APIs. You can also configure a separate port for PKI authentication by using a YAML configuration file to configure and expose endpoints.
