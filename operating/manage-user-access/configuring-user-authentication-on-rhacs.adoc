Verify that {rh-rhacs-first} is connected to at least one Identity Provider (IDP) for user authentication.

Navigate to `Operating -> Managing user access`, and select the appropriate module to set up your own IDP immediately after provisioning.
After the IDP authenticates you, {product-title-short} maps your account to roles that determine your permissions and access scope.

You can set up your own IDP right after provisioning using one of the guides under `Operating -> Managing user access`.

To authorize users, {product-title-short} relies on mapping rules that examine the values of specific claims like `groups`, `email`, `userid` and `name` from either the user ID token or the `UserInfo` endpoint response in OpenID Connect (OIDC).

If these details are absent, the mapping cannot succeed and the user does not get access to the required resources.
Therefore, you need to ensure that the claims required to authorize users from your IDP, for example, `groups`, are included in the authentication response of your IDP to enable successful mapping.

Add specific claims, for example, `groups` claim to tokens using Single Sign-On (SSO) configuration, and assign users, groups, or both to the enterprise application.
