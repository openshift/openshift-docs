{ocp} includes a built-in OAuth server that you can use as an authentication provider for {product-title} ({product-title-short}).

[CAUTION]
====
The {ocp} OAuth server integration only works when you install {product-title} by using the `roxctl` CLI on {ocp}. It does not work when you install {product-title-short} by using Helm or the {product-title-short} Operator.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
* To disable the {ocp} OAuth server integration, set the `ROX_ENABLE_OPENSHIFT_AUTH` environment variable to `false` in Central:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n stackrox set env deploy/central ROX_ENABLE_OPENSHIFT_AUTH=false
----
+
When you disable the {ocp} OAuth server integration, all the previously configured {ocp} OAuth providers stop working and they are not listed as a login option. The UI still shows the option to configure {ocp} OAuth server, but the integration will not work.
* Integration with {ocp} OAuth server is only available for {ocp} 4.1 and newer.
* If you use a custom TLS certificate for {ocp} OAuth server, you must add the certificate as a trusted root CA or as a Kubernetes secret `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-ca.crt`. Otherwise, Central will not establish a TLS connection with the {ocp} OAuth server.
