Optional: If you installed the Compliance Operator _after_ installing {product-title-short}, restart Sensor in the secured cluster by performing one of the following options:

* Run the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc -n stackrox delete pod -lapp=sensor
----
* In the {ocp} web console, perform the following steps:
.. Change the active project to `stackrox`.
.. Navigate to *Workloads* -> *Pods*.
.. Locate the pod with the name starting with `sensor-`, and then click *Actions* -> *Delete Pod.* 

.Verification
After performing these steps, run a compliance scan in {product-title-short} and ensure that `ocp4-cis` and `ocp4-cis-node` results are displayed. See "Running a compliance scan" in the "Additional resources" section for more information.
