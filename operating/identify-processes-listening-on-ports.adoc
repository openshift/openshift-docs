[role="_abstract"]
Understanding which processes are listening on what ports can help identify potentially malicious activities or misconfigurations.
You can use this information to ensure the security and stability of the cluster.
This information can also help handle compliance and regulatory requirements because it provides a clear picture of the cluster's running processes and open ports.

To efficiently assess the security posture of your cluster, you use {product-title} ({product-title-short}) to report on open ports and processes using those ports.

[NOTE]
====
Processes listening on ports feature is not enabled by default when you install {product-title-short}, you must enable it first.
