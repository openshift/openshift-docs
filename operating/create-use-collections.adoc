toc::[]

[role="_abstract"]

You can use collections in {product-title-short} to define and name a group of resources by using matching patterns. You can then configure system processes to use these collections.

Currently, collections are available only under the following conditions:

* Collections are available only for deployments.
* You can only use collections with vulnerability reporting. See "Vulnerability reporting" in the Additional resources section for more information.
* Deployment collections are only available to {product-title-short} customers if they are using the PostgreSQL database.
+
[NOTE]
====
By default, {product-title-managed-short} uses the PostgreSQL database, and it is also used by default when installing {product-title-short} release 4.0 and later. {product-title-short} customers using an earlier release than 3.74 can migrate to the PostgreSQL database with help from Red Hat.

== Prerequisites

A user account must have the following permissions to use the Collections feature:

* `WorkflowAdministration`: You must have *Read* access to view collections and *Write* access to add, change, or delete collections.
* `Deployment`: You need *Read Access* or *Read and Write Access* to understand how configured rules will match with deployments.

These permissions are included in the `Admin` system role. For more information about roles and permissions, see "Managing RBAC in {product-title-short}" in "Additional resources".

[id="API_support_collections"]
== Managing collections by using the API

You can configure collections by using the `CollectionService` API object. For example, you can use `CollectionService_DryRunCollection` to return a list of results equivalent to the live preview panel in the {product-title-short} portal. For more information, navigate to *Help* -> *API reference* in the {product-title-short} portal.
