Using {rh-rhacs-first} you can view policy violations, navigate to the actual cause of the violation, and take corrective actions.

{product-title-short}'s built-in policies identify a variety of security findings, including vulnerabilities (CVEs), violations of DevOps best practices, high-risk build and deployment practices, and suspicious runtime behaviors.
Whether you use the default out-of-box security policies or use your own custom policies, {product-title-short} reports a violation when an enabled policy fails.
