Learn the specifics of {product-title} architecture including design intent, how it differs from {OCP}, and API compatibility.

[id="microshift-architectural-design_{context}"]
== Architectural design
{product-title} is a single-node container orchestration runtime designed to extend the benefits of using containers for running applications to low-resource edge environments. {product-title} contains only the APIs and features essential to operating in edge and small form factor computing environments. The following operational differences from {OCP} can help you understand where {product-title} can be deployed:

[id="microshift-differences-ocp_{context}"]
== Key differences from {OCP}
* Application-level events and metrics are observation-only
* Devices with {product-title} installed are self-managing
* Compatible with RPM-OStree-based systems
* Uses only the APIs needed for essential functions, such as security and runtime controls
* Enables a subset of commands from the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) tool

// * You can use in locations where full control is needed
// * Works offline and in low-connectivity environments
// * You do not need to perform external orchestration
// * Installs on top of {op-system-first}, an operating system especially for edge computing
// * Use several single-node deployments to ... (use case example)
// Bullets need more specific detail

== {product-title} OpenShift APIs

In addition to the standard Kubernetes APIs, {product-title} includes a subset of the APIs supported by {OCP}.
