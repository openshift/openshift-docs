After installing {product-title-managed-short}, you can perform some steps to verify that the installation was successful.

To verify installation, access your ACS Console from the {cloud-console}. The Dashboard displays the number of clusters that {product-title-managed-short} is monitoring, along with information about nodes, deployments, images, and violations.

If no data appears in the ACS Console:

* Ensure that at least one secured cluster is connected to your {product-title-managed-short} instance. For more information, see xref:../installing_cloud_ocp/install-secured-cluster-cloud-ocp.adoc#installing-sc-operator-cloud-ocp[Installing secured cluster resources from RHACS Cloud Service].
* Examine your Sensor pod logs to ensure that the connection to your {product-title-managed-short} instance is successful.
* In the {osp} cluster, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Clusters* to verify that the components are healthy and view additional operational information.
* Examine the values in the `SecuredCluster` API in the Operator on your local cluster to ensure that the *Central API Endpoint* has been entered correctly. This value should be the same value as shown in the *ACS instance* details in the {cloud-console}.
