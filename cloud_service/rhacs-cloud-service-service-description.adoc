[id="architecture_{context}"]
== Architecture

{product-title-managed-short} is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) over two regions, eu-west-1 and us-east-1, and uses the network access points provided by the cloud provider.
Each tenant from {product-title-managed-short} uses highly-available egress proxies and is spread over 3 availability zones. For more information about {product-title-managed-short} system architecture and components, see xref:../cloud_service/acscs-architecture.adoc#acscs-architecture-overview_acscs-architecture[{rh-rhacscs-first} architecture].

[id="security-and-compliance_{context}"]
== Security and compliance

All {product-title-managed-short} data in the Central instance is encrypted in transit and at rest.
The data is stored in secure storage with full replication and high availability together with regularly-scheduled backups.
{product-title-managed-short} is available through cloud data centers that ensure optimal performance and the ability to meet data residency requirements.

[id="sdlc-security_{context}"]
=== Systems development lifecycle security

Red{nbsp}Hat follows secure development lifecycle practices. Red{nbsp}Hat Product Security practices are aligned with the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and ISO12207:2017 wherever it is feasible. Red{nbsp}Hat covers OWASP project recommendations along with other secure software development practices to increase the general security posture of our products. OWASP project analysis is included in Red{nbsp}Hat's automated scanning, security testing, and threat models, as the OWASP project is built based on selected CWE weaknesses. Red{nbsp}Hat monitors weaknesses in our products to address issues before they are exploited and become vulnerabilities.

For more information, see the following resources:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/security_testing_sdl_practice[Red{nbsp}Hat Software Development Life Cycle practices]
* link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/security-design-security-principles-and-threat-modeling[Security by design: Security principles and threat modeling]

Applications are scanned regularly and the container scan results of the product are available publicly. For example, on the Red{nbsp}Hat Ecosystem Catalog site, you can select a component image such as `rhacs-main` and click the *Security* tab to see the health index and the status of security updates.

As part of Red{nbsp}Hat's policy, a support policy and maintenance plan is issued for any third-party components we depend on that go to end-of-life.

[id="access-control_{context}"]
== Access control

User accounts are managed with role-based access control (RBAC). See xref:../operating/manage-user-access/manage-role-based-access-control-3630.adoc#manage-role-based-access-control[Managing RBAC in Red{nbsp}Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes] for more information. Red{nbsp}Hat site reliability engineers (SREs) have access to Central instances. Access is controlled with OpenShift RBAC. Credentials are instantly revoked upon termination.

[id="authentication-provider_{context}"]
=== Authentication provider

When you create a Central instance using link:https://console.redhat.com/[Red{nbsp}Hat Hybrid Cloud Console], authentication for the cluster administrator is configured as part of the process.
Customers must manage all access to the Central instance as part of their integrated solution.
For more information about the available authentication methods, see xref:../operating/manage-user-access/understanding-authentication-providers.adoc#understanding-authentication-providers[Understanding authentication providers].

The default identity provider in {product-title-managed-short} is Red{nbsp}Hat Single Sign-On (SSO). Authorization rules are set up to provide administrator access to the user who created the {product-title-managed-short} and to users who are marked as organization administrators in Red{nbsp}Hat SSO. The `admin` login is disabled for {product-title-managed-short} by default and can only be enabled temporarily by SREs. For more information about authentication using Red{nbsp}Hat SSO, see xref:../cloud_service/getting-started-rhacs-cloud-ocp.adoc#default-access-acs-console[Default access to the ACS Console].

[id="passwords_{context}"]
=== Password management

Red{nbsp}Hat's password policy requires the use of a complex password.
Passwords must contain at least 14 characters and at least three of the following character classes:

* Base 10 digits (0 to 9)
* Upper case characters (A to Z)
* Lower case characters (a to z)
* Punctuation, spaces, and other characters

Most systems require two-factor authentication.

Red{nbsp}Hat follows best password practices according to link:https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html[NIST guidelines].

[id="remote-access_{context}"]
=== Remote access

Access for remote support and troubleshooting is strictly controlled through implementation of the following guidelines:

* Strong two-factor authentication for VPN access
* A segregated network with management and administrative networks requiring additional authentication through a bastion host
* All access and management is performed over encrypted sessions

Our customer support team offers Bomgar as a remote access solution for troubleshooting. Bomgar sessions are optional, must be initiated by the customer, and can be monitored and controlled.

To prevent information leakage, logs are shipped to SRE through our security information and event management (SIEM) application, Splunk.

[id="access-restriction_{context}"]
=== Central access restriction by IP addresses and CIDR ranges

Restricting access to Central ensures that only traffic from trusted IP addresses can reach the security policy enforcement point, thereby strengthening the overall security posture.

To request restricted access to Central, go to the link:https://access.redhat.com/support[Red Hat Customer Portal] page.
From the Customer Portal, submit a support case requesting the restriction of access to Central.
Be sure to provide the list of trusted IP addresses and CIDR ranges.
The maximum number of IP addresses and CIDR ranges is 55.
