To ensure optimal functionality, use the same {product-title-short} version for your secured clusters that {product-title-managed-short} is running. If you are using automatic upgrades, update all your secured clusters by using automatic upgrades. If you are not using automatic upgrades, complete the instructions in this section on all secured clusters.
