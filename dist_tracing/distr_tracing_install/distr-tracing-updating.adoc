The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) controls the installation, upgrade, and role-based access control (RBAC) of Operators in a cluster. The OLM runs by default in {product-title}.
The OLM queries for available Operators as well as upgrades for installed Operators.
For more information about how {product-title} handles upgrades, refer to the xref:../../operators/understanding/olm/olm-understanding-olm.adoc#olm-understanding-olm[Operator Lifecycle Manager] documentation.

The update approach used by the {DTProductName} Operators upgrades the managed {DTShortName} instances to the version associated with the Operator. Whenever a new version of the {JaegerName} Operator is installed, all the {JaegerShortName} application instances managed by the Operator will be upgraded to the Operator's version. For example, if version 1.10 is installed (both Operator and backend components) and the Operator is upgraded to version 1.11, then as soon as the Operator upgrade has completed, the Operator will scan for running {JaegerShortName} instances and upgrade them to 1.11 as well.

For specific instructions for how to update the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator, refer to xref:../../logging/cluster-logging-upgrading.adoc#cluster-logging-upgrading_cluster-logging-upgrading[Updating OpenShift Logging].
