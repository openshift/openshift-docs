{CNVProductNameStart} provides layer-2 networking capabilities that allow you to connect
virtual machines to multiple networks. You can import virtual machines with
existing workloads that depend on access to multiple interfaces. You can also
configure a PXE network so that you can boot machines over the network.

To get started, a network administrator configures a bridge NetworkAttachmentDefinition
for a namespace in the web console or CLI. Users can then create a vNIC to attach Pods and virtual machines in that namespace to the bridge network.

[NOTE]
====
When defining the vNIC in the next section, ensure that the *NETWORK* value is
the bridge network name from the NetworkAttachmentDefinition you created
in the previous section.

Install the optional xref:../../../cnv/cnv-virtual-machines/cnv-vm-networking/cnv-installing-qemu-guest-agent.adoc#cnv-installing-qemu-guest-agent[QEMU guest agent] on the virtual machine so that the host can display relevant information about the additional networks.
