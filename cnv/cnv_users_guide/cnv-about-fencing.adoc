= About Fencing

Fencing is the process of isolating a failed node to protect a cluster and its resources.
A node is considered _fenced_ when it can no longer access shared resources.
Without fencing, a failed node can result in data corruption.

In the case of an unhealthy node, Pods and virtual machines that depend on
persistent storage cannot be replaced on another node until it can be confirmed
that the original Pod or virtual machine is no longer accessing the storage.
Fencing the node ensures that the workloads are no longer running on the
unhealthy node, protecting the persistent storage. Once fencing is complete,
workloads resume on other nodes.
