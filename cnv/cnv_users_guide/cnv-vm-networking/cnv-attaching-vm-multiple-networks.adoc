{CNVProductNameStart} provides Layer-2 networking capabilities that allow you to connect
virtual machines to multiple networks. You can import virtual machines with
existing workloads that depend on access to multiple interfaces. You can also
configure a PXE network so that you can boot machines over the network.

To get started, a network administrator configures a NetworkAttachmentDefinition
of type `cnv-bridge`. Then, users can attach Pods, virtual machine instances,
and virtual machines to the
bridge network. From the {CNVProductName} web console, you can create a vNIC
that refers to the bridge network.

[NOTE]
====
When defining the vNIC in the next section, ensure that the *NETWORK* value is
the bridge network name from the NetworkAttachmentDefinition you created
in the previous section.

Install the optional xref:../../cnv/cnv_users_guide/cnv-installing-qemu-guest-agent.adoc#cnv-installing-qemu-guest-agent[QEMU guest agent] on the virtual machine so that the host can display relevant information about the additional networks.
