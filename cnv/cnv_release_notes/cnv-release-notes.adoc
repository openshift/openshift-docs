== About {CNVProductName}

include::modules/cnv-what-you-can-do-with-cnv.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

=== {CNVProductNameStart} support

:FeatureName: {CNVProductName}
include::modules/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

== New and changed features

=== Supported binding methods
* Open vSwitch (OVS) is no longer recommended and should not be used
in {CNVProductName} 2.0.
* For the default Pod network, `masquerade` is the only recommended binding
method. It is not supported for non-default networks.
* For secondary networks, use the `bridge` binding method.

=== Web console improvements
* The {product-title} dashboard captures high-level information about clusters.
From the OpenShift web console, access the dashboard by clicking *Home > Dashboards > Overview*. Note that virtual machines are no longer listed in the web console project overview. Virtual machines are now listed within the *Cluster Inventory* card of the dashboard.
* You can now view all services associated with a virtual machine in the
*Virtual Machine Details* screen.


== Resolved issues

* Deleting a PVC after a CDI import fails no longer results in the importer Pod
getting stuck in a `CrashLoopBackOff` state. The PVC is now deleted normally.

== Known issues

* Some KubeVirt resources are improperly retained when removing {CNVProductName}.
As a workaround, you must manually remove them by running the command
`oc delete apiservices v1alpha3.subresources.kubevirt.io -n openshift-cnv`.
These resources will be removed automatically after
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1712429[*BZ#1712429*]) is
resolved.

* When using an older version of `virtctl` with {CNVProductName} 2.0, `virtctl`
cannot connect to the requested virtual machine. On the client, update the
`virtctl` RPM package to the latest version to resolve this issue.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1706108[*BZ#1706108*])

* Interfaces connected to the default Pod network lose connectivity after
live migration. As a workaround, use an additional `multus`-backed network.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1693532[*BZ#1693532*])

* {CNVProductNameStart} cannot reliably identify node drains that are triggered by
running either `oc adm drain` or `kubectl drain`. Do not run these commands on
the nodes of any clusters where {CNVProductName} is deployed. The nodes might not
drain if there are virtual machines running on top of them.
The current solution is to put nodes into maintenance.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1707427[*BZ#1707427*])

* If you create a virtual machine with the Pod network connected in `bridge`
mode and use a `cloud-init` disk, the virtual machine will lose its network
connectivity after being restarted. As a workaround, remove the `HWADDR` line
in the file `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0`.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1708680[*BZ#1708680*])

* Masquerade does not currently work with CNV. Due to an upstream issue,
you cannot connect a virtual machine to the default Pod network while in Masquerade mode.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1725848[*BZ#1725848*])

* Creating a NIC with Masquerade in the wizard does not allow you to specify the `port` option.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1725848[*BZ#1725848*])

* If a virtual machine uses guaranteed CPUs, it will not be scheduled, because
the label `cpumanager=true` is not automatically set on nodes. As a
workaround, remove the `CPUManager` entry from the `kubevirt-config` ConfigMap.
Then, manually label the nodes with `cpumanager=true` before running virtual
machines with guaranteed CPUs on your cluster.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1718944[*BZ#1718944*])

* If you use the web console to create a virtual machine template that has the same name as an existing
virtual machine, the operation fails and the message `Name is already used by another virtual machine` is displayed.
As a workaround, create the template from the command line.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1717930[*BZ#1717930*])

* ReadWriteMany (RWX) is the only supported storage access mode for live migration,
importing VMware virtual machines, and creating virtual machines by using the
wizard.
