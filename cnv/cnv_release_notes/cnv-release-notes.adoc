// For 2.3: Add new Known Issues above this line (so that we don't mix the new with the old/possibly no longer irrelevant ones)
// Don't remove: this BZ is probably true for all 2.x releases
* The `masquerade` binding method for virtual machines cannot be used in clusters with RHEL 7 compute nodes.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1741626[*BZ#1741626*])

// The following 7 bugs are from the 2.2 release notes but from their bugs they still seem to be relevant for 2.3:
* After migration, a virtual machine is assigned a new IP address. However, the
commands `oc get vmi` and `oc describe vmi` still generate output containing the
obsolete IP address. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1686208[*BZ#1686208*])
+
** As a workaround, view the correct IP address by running the following command:
+
----
$ oc get pod -o wide
----

* Users without administrator privileges cannot add a network interface
to a project in an L2 network using the virtual machine wizard.
This issue is caused by missing permissions that allow users to load
network attachment definitions.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1743985[*BZ#1743985*])
+
** As a workaround, provide the user with permissions to load the network attachment
definitions.
+
. Define `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` objects to the YAML configuration
file, using the following examples:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
 name: cni-resources
rules:
- apiGroups: ["k8s.cni.cncf.io"]
 resources: ["*"]
 verbs: ["*"]
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: <role-binding-name>
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cni-resources
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: <user to grant the role to>
  namespace: <namespace of the user>
----
+
. As a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command to create the `ClusterRole`
and `ClusterRoleBinding` objects you defined:
+
----
$ oc create -f <filename>.yaml
----

* Live migration fails when nodes have different CPU models. Even in cases where
nodes have the same physical CPU model, differences introduced by microcode
updates have the same effect. This is because the default settings trigger
host CPU passthrough behavior, which is incompatible with live migration.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1760028[*BZ#1760028*])
+
** As a workaround, set the default CPU model in the `kubevirt-config` ConfigMap,
as shown in the following example:
+
[NOTE]
====
You must make this change before starting the virtual machines that support
live migration.
====
+
. Open the `kubevirt-config` ConfigMap for editing by running the following command:
+
----
$ oc edit configmap kubevirt-config -n openshift-cnv
----
+
. Edit the ConfigMap:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-config
data:
  default-cpu-model: "<cpu-model>" <1>
----
<1> Replace `<cpu-model>` with the actual CPU model value. You can determine this
value by running `oc describe node <node>` for all nodes and looking at the
`cpu-model-<name>` labels. Select the CPU model that is present on all of your
nodes.

* When attempting to create and launch a virtual machine using a Haswell CPU,
the launch of the virtual machine can fail due to incorrectly labeled nodes.
This is a change in behavior from previous versions of container-native
virtualization, where virtual machines could be successfully launched on Haswell hosts.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1781497[*BZ#1781497*])
+
As a workaround, select a different CPU model, if possible.

* The {CNVProductName} upgrade process occasionally fails due to an interruption
from the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). This issue is caused by the limitations
associated with using a declarative API to track the state of {CNVProductName}
Operators. Enabling automatic updates during
xref:../cnv_install/installing-container-native-virtualization.adoc#cnv-subscribing-to-the-catalog_installing-container-native-virtualization[installation]
decreases the risk of encountering this issue.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1759612[*BZ#1759612*])

* {CNVProductNameStart} cannot reliably identify node drains that are triggered by
running either `oc adm drain` or `kubectl drain`. Do not run these commands on
the nodes of any clusters where {CNVProductName} is deployed. The nodes might not
drain if there are virtual machines running on top of them.
The current solution is to put nodes into maintenance.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1707427[*BZ#1707427*])

// Temporary comment: BZ1819700 PR (#20823) likely to conflict here because of updated version change. 
* If you navigate to the *Subscription* tab on the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*
page and click the current upgrade channel to edit it, there might be no visible results.
If this occurs, there are no visible errors.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1796410[*BZ#1796410*])
+
** As a workaround, trigger the upgrade process to {CNVProductName} {CNVVersion}
from the CLI by running the following `oc` patch command:
+
----
$ export TARGET_NAMESPACE=openshift-cnv CNV_CHANNEL=2.3 && oc patch -n "${TARGET_NAMESPACE}" $(oc get subscription -n ${TARGET_NAMESPACE} --no-headers -o name) --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/channel", "value":"'${CNV_CHANNEL}'"}, {"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/installPlanApproval", "value":"Automatic"}]'
----
+
This command points your subscription to upgrade channel `2.3` and enables automatic updates.
