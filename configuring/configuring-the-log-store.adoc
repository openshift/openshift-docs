=== Deploying a Loki log store on a cluster that uses short-term credentials

For some storage providers, you can use the Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`) during installation to implement short-term credentials. These credentials are created and managed outside the {ocp-product-title} cluster. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/authentication_and_authorization/managing-cloud-provider-credentials#cco-short-term-creds[Manual mode with short-term credentials for components].

[NOTE]
====
Short-term credential authentication must be configured during a new installation of {loki-op}, on a cluster that uses this credentials strategy. You cannot configure an existing cluster that uses a different credentials strategy to use this feature.
