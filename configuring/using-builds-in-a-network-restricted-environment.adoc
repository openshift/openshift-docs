The {pipelines-operator} provides support for injecting the proxy environment variables in the network-restricted environments. The Operator installs a proxy webhook that sets the proxy environment variables in the containers of the pod created by tekton-controllers based on the `cluster` proxy object.

You can also configure the cluster-wide proxy. To configure cluster-wide proxy, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.17/html/configuring_network_settings/enable-cluster-wide-proxy#prerequisites_cluster-wide-proxy[Configuring cluster-wide proxy]
