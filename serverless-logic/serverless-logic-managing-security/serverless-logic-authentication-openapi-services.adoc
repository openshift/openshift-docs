To secure an OpenAPI service operation, define a `Security Scheme` by using the OpenAPI specification. These schemes are in the `securitySchemes` section of the OpenAPI specification file. You must configure the operation by adding a `Security Requirement` that refers to that `Security Scheme`. When a workflow invokes such operation, that information is used to determine the required authentication configuration.

This section outlines the supported authentication types and demonstrates how to configure them to access secured OpenAPI service operations within your workflows.
