{ServerlessLogicProductName} uses Maven Central by default to resolve Maven artifacts during workflow builds. The provided builder and development images include all required Java libraries to run workflows, but in certain scenarios, such as when you add a custom Quarkus extension, you must download the additional dependencies from Maven Central.

In environments with restricted or firewalled network access, direct access to Maven Central might not be available. In such cases, you can configure the workflow containers to use a custom Maven mirror, such as an internal company registry or repository manager.

You can configure a custom Maven mirror at different levels as follows:

* Per workflow build by updating the `SonataFlowBuild` custom resource.
* At the platform level by updating the `SonataFlowPlatform` custom resource. 
* For development mode deployments by editing the `SonataFlow` custom resource.
* When building custom images externally with the builder image
