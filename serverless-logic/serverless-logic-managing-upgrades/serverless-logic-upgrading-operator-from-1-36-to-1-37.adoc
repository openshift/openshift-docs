== Preparing for the upgrade

Before starting the upgrade process, you need to prepare your {ServerlessLogicProductName} environment to upgrade from version 1.36.0 to 1.37.0. 

The preparation process is as follows:

* Deleting and redeploying workflows based on their profiles.
* Backing up all necessary databases and resources.
* Ensuring you have a record of all custom configurations.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} installed on your cluster.
* You have access to a {ServerlessLogicProductName} project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {ocp-product-title}.
* You have backups for all workflow, Data Index, and Job Service databases where persistence is enabled.
* You have access to all namespaces where SonataFlow, Data Index, and Job Service are deployed.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
