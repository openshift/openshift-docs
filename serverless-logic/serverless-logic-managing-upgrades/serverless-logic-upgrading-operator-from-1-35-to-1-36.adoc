== Preparing for the upgrade

Before starting the upgrade process, you need to prepare your {ServerlessLogicProductName} environment to upgrade from version 1.35.0 to 1.36.0. 

The preparation process is as follows:

* Deleting or scaling workflows based on their profiles.
* Backing up all necessary databases and resources.
* Ensuring you have a record of all custom configurations.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} installed on your cluster.
* You have access to a {ServerlessLogicProductName} project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {ocp-product-title}.
* You have access to the *OpenShift Management Console* for Operator upgrades.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
