== Deploying workflows in Preview mode

You can deploy your local workflow on {ocp-product-title} in Preview mode. This allows you to experiment and modify your workflow directly on the cluster, seeing changes almost immediately. Preview mode is used for final testing and validation before deploying to production. It also ensures that workflows will run smoothly in a production-like setting.

.Prerequisites

* You have an {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} installed on your cluster.
* You have access to an {ServerlessLogicProductName} project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {ocp-product-title}.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI `(oc)`.

To deploy a workflow in Preview mode, {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} uses the build system on {ocp-product-title}, which automatically creates the image for deploying your workflow.

The following sections explain how to build and deploy your workflow on a cluster using the {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} with a `SonataFlow` custom resource.
