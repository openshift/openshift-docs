Docker::
Docker is an open-source technology that creates and deploys containers. That is pretty much all you need to know.

Wait. What's a container, you ask? Don't worry. We'll xref:../openshift-tutorial/terms.adoc#openshift-tutorial-terms-container[get to that soon]. 

But, if you are curious about Docker, you can start with link:https://www.redhat.com/en/containers/what-is-docker[What is Docker?].

Kubernetes:: 
A level above the Docker infrastructure is Kubernetes.

_If_ you read the {product-title} xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-kubernetes-infrastructure[{product-title} documentation], you will learn that _Kubernetes manages containerized applications across a set of containers or hosts and provides mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and application-scaling. The Docker service packages, instantiates, and runs containerized applications_.

But, all you really need to know is that Kubernetes is what {product-title} uses to manage the Docker containers. Kubernets provides the management, orchestration, scheduling, and operation of containers. You do not need to know how to use the Kubernetes console or CLI, becuase the {product-title} console and CLI interact with Kubernetes for you. 

Again, for the curious, take a look at: link:https://www.redhat.com/en/containers/what-is-kubernetes[What is Kubernetes?].
  
{product-title}::
We kind of hoped you would what {product-title} is all about.

But, since you asked, {product-title} provides an environment for you and your organization to develop, deploy and run applications in a cloud environment.

If you are an app developer, you know how it works. You code in your chosen language (perl, python, ruby, whatever) here; build over there (in Jenkins, for one);  push the code off to some repository like Git; do testing with Cucumber or Jasmin; deploy to staging deploy to production.

You administrators want to make this easy and quick. Super-quick work environments; autoscaling; multiple environments, languages, databases; FQDNs and routing; private and public deployments; monitoring and logging all in one place. How much easier is that?

To help you get it done, {product-title} has the following features:

* Console. The {product-title} web console is a user interface accessible from a web browser for developers and admins to create applications and manage projects. 
* CLI. Or, if you prefer, you can use the command line to work with your applications and projects. Or, use both the GUI and the CLI alternatively. The two interfaces stay in sync. 
* Container Registry. provides an integrated container registry called OpenShift Container Registry (OCR) that adds the ability to automatically provision new image repositories on demand. This provides users with a built-in location for their application builds to push the resulting images.
* Logging. Logs for the various services in a project can be aggregated using an EFK stack (that's ElasticSearch to store logs; Fluentd to gather the logs up for ElasticSearch; and the Kibana web UI to view them).

Now that you know the technology behind {project-title}, get introduced to some specific terminology that you will use everyday.
