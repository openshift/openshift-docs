== Launch the Console

By deafult, the URL to launch the {product-title} web console is the host name of the master system and the web console port number. We will show you how to find this information later.

For example, for a master host with a host name of `master.openshift.com` and the default port of `8443`, the web console would be found at `https://master.openshift.com:8443/console`.
 
Enter the appropriate URL in your browser and the console displays, simimar to this:

image::login.png[login screen, align="center"]

If you have followed the steps in xref:../../openshift-tutorial/tutorial-walkthrough.adoc#openshift-tutorial-config[A Few Necessary Configurations], log in with the user you created.  

image::newlogin.png[new login, align="center"]

[TIP]
====
If you skipped the configuration tasks, you likely missed where we told you the default authenticaion does not allow any user to log in and you must create a user!
====

You see that you have no projects in a new {product-title} instance. So, the first thing you will need to do in a new 
{product-title} instance is to create one. There is a convenient button on the screen so you can do just that. 

If you prefer using the command-line, click the question mark icon and select *Command Line Tools* from the list. We will go through
all of the same tasks xref:openshift-tutorial-walk-cli[using the CLI] a bit later. Or, go there now, if you prefer using commands over
the UI. It doesn't matter which tool you use (or use both!). 

[[openshift-tutorial-walk-ui-create]]
=== Create a project

If this is a new installation of {product-title}, the console will let you do litle other than create a project. Click the *New Project* button to get
started.

image::new-project.png[new project, align="center"]

Here, just give the project a name, such as _my-new-project_. As the console will certainly tell you if you do it wrong:

----
Project names may only contain lower-case letters, numbers, and dashes. They may not start or end with a dash. 
----

The *Display Name* can be pretty much anything. But, it is probably easier to keep the Display Name similar to the project name, such as _My New Project_.
The *Description* is optional and quite self-explanatory.

Click *Create* and image:boom-small.png[boom, title="Boom", 25,25] you have a project. 

The project opens with a page that you use to create apps. You can select a language, like Perl or Python, or a technolohy like CICD or single-sign on. We can look at this later.

Click the {product-title} at the top of the page to get to the main page, where you see the available projects. Here you see the project we created, with thde *My New Project* display name, the project name, and description we assigned when creating the project.

image::console-main.png[main console, align="center"]

Click anywhere on the prject to launch the project page.

=== Review the Panels

If you have an {product-title} instance of your own open, feel free to click around on the tabs down the left side. There is not much to see, as there
is nothing in the project, yet. But, you can see what you will see once you create some.

The *Applications* tab will show your:

* Deploymernts. A xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments#architecture-core-concepts-deployments[deployment] is a {product-title} object that consists of a deployment configuration, replication controller, and pod. 
* Pods. We described xref:../../openshift-tutorial/tutorial-terms.adoc#openshift-tutorial-pods[pods] earlier as a collection of one or more containers.
* Services. We also talked about xref:../../openshift-tutorial/tutorial-terms.adoc#openshift-terms-service[services], defining them as specific sets of pods.
* Routes. A xref:../../openshift-tutorial/tutorial-terms.adoc#openshift-terms-route[route], we said, makes services accessible.  

The *Builds* tab will show your:

* Builds. We defined xref:../../openshift-tutorial/tutorial-terms.adoc#openshift-tutorial-terms-builds[builds] as the process for turning source code into a runnable image.
* Pipelines. A xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#pipeline-build[pipeline] is a build strategy that uses Jenkins. 
* Images. xref:../../openshift-tutorial/tutorial-terms.adoc#openshift-tutorial-terms-images[Images] are templates for creating containers.

The *Resouces* tab contains:

* Quotas. A reporting of xref:../../dev_guide/compute_resources.adoc#overview[project quota], which are limits on the objects or amount of compute resources. 
* Membership. A list of xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[users and user roles] for the project.
* ConfigMaps. A list of xref:../../dev_guide/configmaps.adocl#overview[ConfigMap objects], which allow you to inject data into containers.
* Secrets. A list of xref:../../dev_guide/secrets.adoc#dev-guide-secrets-using-secrets[Secret objects] for sensitive information such as passwords.
* Other Reources. Several lists of different types of objects. 

The *Storage* tab will show your persistent storage voulmes. 

The *Monitoring* tab is where you go to monitor your resources. 


[[openshift-tutorial-walk-cli]]
== Using the CLI

{product-title} also offers the ability to use command-line commands.

=== 

You probably already know how to do this. But, in casde you don't:

. Launch a console session from any system that has the {product-title} CLI client tools installed and can access the master.

. From that console Use SSH to log into the master system:
+
----
$ oc login <master-ip>:443
----
+
image::login-master.png[new login, align="center"]

And, you are in. As a test, you can use `oc version` to make sure you are connected. 

----
$ oc version
oc v3.3.1.4
kubernetes v1.3.0+52492b4
features: Basic-Auth GSSAPI Kerberos SPNEGO

Server https://open.paas.redhat.com:443
openshift v3.5.5.31
kubernetes v1.5.2+43a9be4
----

[[openshift-tutorial-walk-cli-login]]
=== Logging In

If you have followed the steps in xref:../../openshift-tutorial/tutorial-walkthrough.adoc#openshift-tutorial-config[A Few Necessary Configurations], log in with the user you created. 

----
oc login admin pass
----

[TIP]
====
If you skipped the configuration tasks, you likely missed where we told you the default authenticaion does not allow any user to log in and you must create a user!
====

[[openshift-tutorial-walk-ui-create]]
=== Create a project

The `oc prjects` command will give you a list of avaqilable projects. 

If this is a new installation of {product-title}, there are no projects by defualt. Well, for admins, there is a default project called `default`, but you won't be working in there. 

----
$ oc projects
You are not a member of any projects. You can request a project to be created with the 'new-project' command.
----

So, let's create one. Use the `oc new-project` command to create the project and place you into it. Like the web console, you will assign a project name, a display name, and an optional description. 

----
$ oc new-project my-cli-project --display-name="My CLI Project" --description="I made this with CLI"
Already on project "my-cli-project" on server "https://open.paas.redhat.com:443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app centos/ruby-22-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git

to build a new example application in Ruby.
----

Now, when you run `oc projects`, you will see your project.

----
oc projects
You have one project on this server: "My CLI Project (my-cli-project)".
----

=== Listing Resources

Now, if you look back up at the xref:openshift-tutorial-walk-ui[Reviewing the Panels] section for the web console, you can get the same or similar information 
on most of the resources listed and a lot more: 

----
Valid resource types include:
   * buildconfigs (aka 'bc')
   * builds
   * componentstatuses (aka 'cs')
   * configmaps
   * daemonsets (aka 'ds')
   * deploymentconfigs (aka 'dc')
   * deployments
   * events (aka 'ev')
   * endpoints (aka 'ep')
   * horizontalpodautoscalers (aka 'hpa')
   * imagestreamimages (aka 'isimage')
   * imagestreams (aka 'is')
   * imagestreamtags (aka 'istag')
   * ingress (aka 'ing')
   * groups
   * jobs
   * limitranges (aka 'limits')
   * nodes (aka 'no')
   * namespaces (aka 'ns')
   * pods (aka 'po')
   * persistentvolumes (aka 'pv')
   * persistentvolumeclaims (aka 'pvc')
   * policies
   * projects
   * quota
   * resourcequotas (aka 'quota')
   * replicasets (aka 'rs')
   * replicationcontrollers (aka 'rc')
   * rolebindings
   * routes
   * secrets
   * serviceaccounts (aka 'sa')
   * services (aka 'svc')
   * users
----

[NOTE]
====
You can use the shortcuts shown about as *aka* values.
====

You can try a few now, if you want. But, because this is a brand new installation of {project-title}, you 
won't find much in there. We can change that in the next lesson where we will build an app of our own.

----
$ oc get deployments
$ oc get pods <1>
$ oc get events
$ oc get svc
$ oc get real <2>
the server doesn't have a resource type "real"
----

<1> The blank response line indicates there is no resource object.
<2> Just a test to make sure things are working.
