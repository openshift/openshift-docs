[NOTE]
====
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rosa/latest/userguide/security-iam-awsmanpol.html[AWS managed policies] are created and administered by AWS. The permissions defined within the AWS managed policies cannot be changed. They are used as part of the AWS STS security process that you can use to assign permissions to users, groups, and roles.

If the permissions defined in an AWS managed policy are updated by AWS, the update will apply to all users, groups, and roles related to the policy.
