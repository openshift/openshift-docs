toc::[]

Configure an `oidc` identity provider to integrate with an OpenID Connect
identity provider using an
link:http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth[Authorization Code Flow].

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
You can link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#openshift[configure a Keycloak] server as an OpenID
Connect identity provider for {product-title}.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale[]
You can
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/[configure Red Hat Single Sign-On]
as an OpenID Connect identity provider for {product-title}.
endif::[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Authentication Operator in {product-title} requires that the configured
OpenID Connect identity provider implements the
link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html[OpenID Connect Discovery]
specification.
====

[NOTE]
====
`ID Token` and `UserInfo` decryptions are not supported.
====

By default, the `openid` scope is requested. If required, extra scopes can be
specified in the `extraScopes` field.

Claims are read from the JWT `id_token` returned from the OpenID identity
provider and, if specified, from the JSON returned by the `UserInfo` URL.

At least one claim must be configured to use as the user's identity. The
standard identity claim is `sub`.

You can also indicate which claims to use as the user's preferred user name,
display name, and email address. If multiple claims are specified, the first one
with a non-empty value is used. The standard claims are:

[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===

|Claim
|Description

|`sub`
|Short for "subject identifier." The remote identity for the user at the
issuer.

|`preferred_username`

link:http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims[OpenID claims documentation]
for more information.

Using an OpenID Connect identity provider requires users to get a token using
`<master>/oauth/token/request` to use with command-line tools.
