Manual mode is supported for Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

In manual mode, a user manages cloud credentials instead of the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO). To use this mode, you must examine the `CredentialsRequest` CRs in the release image for the version of {product-title} that you are running or installing, create corresponding credentials in the underlying cloud provider, and create Kubernetes Secrets in the correct namespaces to satisfy all `CredentialsRequest` CRs for the cluster's cloud provider.

Using manual mode allows each cluster component to have only the permissions it requires, without storing an administrator-level credential in the cluster. This mode also does not require connectivity to the AWS public IAM endpoint. However, you must manually reconcile permissions with new release images for every upgrade.

For information about configuring your cloud provider to use manual mode, see the manual credentials management options for your cloud provider:

== Manual mode with cloud credentials created and managed outside of the cluster

An AWS or GCP cluster that uses manual mode might be configured to create and manage cloud credentials from outside of the cluster using the AWS Security Token Service (STS) or GCP Workload Identity. With this configuration, the CCO uses temporary credentials for different components.

For more information, see xref:../../authentication/managing_cloud_provider_credentials/cco-mode-sts.adoc#cco-mode-sts[Using manual mode with Amazon Web Services Security Token Service] or xref:../../authentication/managing_cloud_provider_credentials/cco-mode-gcp-workload-identity.adoc#cco-mode-gcp-workload-identity[Using manual mode with GCP Workload Identity].
