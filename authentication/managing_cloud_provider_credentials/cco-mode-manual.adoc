Manual mode is supported for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

In manual mode, a user manages cloud credentials instead of the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO). To use this mode, you must examine the `CredentialsRequest` CRs in the release image for the version of {product-title} that you are running or installing, create corresponding credentials in the underlying cloud provider, and create Kubernetes Secrets in the correct namespaces to satisfy all `CredentialsRequest` CRs for the cluster's cloud provider.

Using manual mode allows each cluster component to have only the permissions it requires, without storing an administrator-level credential in the cluster. This mode also does not require connectivity to the AWS public IAM endpoint. However, you must manually reconcile permissions with new release images for every upgrade.

For information about configuring your cloud provider to use manual mode, see _Manually creating IAM_ for xref:../../installing/installing_aws/manually-creating-iam.adoc#manually-creating-iam-aws[AWS], xref:../../installing/installing_azure/manually-creating-iam-azure.adoc#manually-creating-iam-azure[Azure], or xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/manually-creating-iam-gcp.adoc#manually-creating-iam-gcp[GCP].

== Manual mode with AWS STS

You can configure an AWS cluster in manual mode to use xref:../../authentication/managing_cloud_provider_credentials/cco-mode-sts.adoc#cco-mode-sts[Amazon Web Services Security Token Service (AWS STS)]. With this configuration, the CCO uses temporary credentials for different components.
