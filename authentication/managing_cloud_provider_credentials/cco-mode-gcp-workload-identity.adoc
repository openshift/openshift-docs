toc::[]

Manual mode with GCP Workload Identity is supported for Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

[NOTE]
====
This credentials strategy is supported for only new {product-title} clusters and must be configured during installation. You cannot reconfigure an existing cluster that uses a different credentials strategy to use this feature.
====

In manual mode with GCP Workload Identity, the individual {product-title} cluster components can impersonate IAM service accounts using short-term, limited-privilege credentials.

Requests for new and refreshed credentials are automated by using an appropriately configured OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider, combined with IAM service accounts. {product-title} signs service account tokens that are trusted by GCP, and can be projected into a pod and used for authentication. Tokens are refreshed after one hour by default.

Using manual mode with GCP Workload Identity changes the content of the GCP credentials that are provided to individual {product-title} components.

== Installing an {product-title} cluster configured for manual mode with GCP Workload Identity

To install a cluster that is configured to use the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) in manual mode with GCP Workload Identity:

. xref:../../authentication/managing_cloud_provider_credentials/cco-mode-gcp-workload-identity.adoc#cco-ccoctl-configuring_cco-mode-gcp-workload-identity[Configure the Cloud Credential Operator utility].
. xref:../../authentication/managing_cloud_provider_credentials/cco-mode-gcp-workload-identity.adoc#cco-ccoctl-creating-at-once_cco-mode-gcp-workload-identity[Create the required GCP resources].
. xref:../../authentication/managing_cloud_provider_credentials/cco-mode-gcp-workload-identity.adoc#sts-mode-installing-manual-run-installer_cco-mode-gcp-workload-identity[Run the {product-title} installer].
. xref:../../authentication/managing_cloud_provider_credentials/cco-mode-gcp-workload-identity.adoc#sts-mode-installing-verifying_cco-mode-gcp-workload-identity[Verify that the cluster is using short-lived credentials].

[NOTE]
====
Because the cluster is operating in manual mode when using GCP Workload Identity, it is not able to create new credentials for components with the permissions that they require. When upgrading to a different minor version of {product-title}, there are often new GCP permission requirements. Before upgrading a cluster that is using GCP Workload Identity, the cluster administrator must manually ensure that the GCP permissions are sufficient for existing components and available to any new components.
