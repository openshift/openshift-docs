Manual mode with STS is available as a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview] for Amazon Web Services (AWS).

:FeatureName: Support for AWS Secure Token Service (STS)
include::modules/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+0]

In manual mode with STS, the individual {product-title} cluster components use AWS Secure Token Service (STS) to assign components IAM roles that provide short-term, limited-privilege security credentials. These credentials are associated with IAM roles that are specific to each component that makes AWS API calls.

Requests for new and refreshed credentials are automated by using an appropriately configured AWS IAM OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider, combined with AWS IAM roles. {product-title} signs service account tokens that are trusted by AWS IAM, and can be projected into a pod and used for authentication. Tokens are refreshed after one hour.

Using manual mode with STS changes the content of the AWS credentials that are provided to individual {product-title} components.
