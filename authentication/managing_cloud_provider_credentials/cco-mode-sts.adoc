toc::[]

Manual mode with STS is supported for Amazon Web Services (AWS).

[NOTE]
====
This credentials strategy is supported for only new {product-title} clusters and must be configured during installation. You cannot reconfigure an existing cluster that uses a different credentials strategy to use this feature.

[id="sts-mode-about"]
== About manual mode with AWS Secure Token Service

In manual mode with STS, the individual {product-title} cluster components use AWS Secure Token Service (STS) to assign components IAM roles that provide short-term, limited-privilege security credentials. These credentials are associated with IAM roles that are specific to each component that makes AWS API calls.

Requests for new and refreshed credentials are automated by using an appropriately configured AWS IAM OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider, combined with AWS IAM roles. {product-title} signs service account tokens that are trusted by AWS IAM, and can be projected into a pod and used for authentication. Tokens are refreshed after one hour.

Using manual mode with STS changes the content of the AWS credentials that are provided to individual {product-title} components.

== Installing an {product-title} cluster configured for manual mode with STS

To install a cluster that is configured to use the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) in manual mode with STS:

[NOTE]
====
Because the cluster is operating in manual mode when using STS, it is not able to create new credentials for components with the permissions that they require. When upgrading to a different minor version of {product-title}, there are often new AWS permission requirements. Before upgrading a cluster that is using STS, the cluster administrator must manually ensure that the AWS permissions are sufficient for existing components and available to any new components.
