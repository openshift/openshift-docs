Mint mode is supported for Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Mint mode is the default mode on the platforms for which it is supported. In this mode, the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) uses the provided administrator-level cloud credential to create new credentials for components in the cluster with only the specific permissions that are required.

If the credential is not removed after installation, it is stored and used by the CCO to process `CredentialsRequest` CRs for components in the cluster and create new credentials for each with only the specific permissions that are required. The continuous reconciliation of cloud credentials in mint mode allows actions that require additional credentials or permissions, such as upgrading, to proceed.

Mint mode stores the administrator-level credential in the cluster `kube-system` namespace. If this approach does not meet the security requirements of your organization, see _Alternatives to storing administrator-level secrets in the kube-system project_ for xref:../../installing/installing_aws/manually-creating-iam.adoc#alternatives-to-storing-admin-secrets-in-kube-system_manually-creating-iam-aws[AWS] or xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/manually-creating-iam-gcp.adoc#alternatives-to-storing-admin-secrets-in-kube-system_manually-creating-iam-gcp[GCP].

[id="mint-mode-permissions"]
== Mint mode permissions requirements
When using the CCO in mint mode, ensure that the credential you provide meets the requirements of the cloud on which you are running or installing {product-title}. If the provided credentials are not sufficient for mint mode, the CCO cannot create an IAM user.

[id="mint-mode-permissions-aws"]
=== Amazon Web Services (AWS) permissions
The credential you provide for mint mode in AWS must have the following permissions:

* `iam:CreateAccessKey`
* `iam:CreateUser`
* `iam:DeleteAccessKey`
* `iam:DeleteUser`
* `iam:DeleteUserPolicy`
* `iam:GetUser`
* `iam:GetUserPolicy`
* `iam:ListAccessKeys`
* `iam:PutUserPolicy`
* `iam:TagUser`
* `iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy`

[id="mint-mode-permissions-gcp"]
=== Google Cloud Platform (GCP) permissions
The credential you provide for mint mode in GCP must have the following permissions:

* `resourcemanager.projects.get`
* `serviceusage.services.list`
* `iam.serviceAccountKeys.create`
* `iam.serviceAccountKeys.delete`
* `iam.serviceAccounts.create`
* `iam.serviceAccounts.delete`
* `iam.serviceAccounts.get`
* `iam.roles.get`
* `resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy`
* `resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy`
