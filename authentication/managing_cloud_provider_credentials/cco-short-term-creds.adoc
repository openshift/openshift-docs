toc::[]

During installation, you can configure the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) to operate in manual mode and use the CCO utility (`ccoctl`) to implement short-term security credentials for individual components that are created and managed outside the {product-title} cluster.

[NOTE]
====
This credentials strategy is supported for Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) only. The strategy must be configured during installation of a new {product-title} cluster. You cannot configure an existing cluster that uses a different credentials strategy to use this feature.
====

//todo: Should provide some more info about the benefits of this here as well. Note: Azure is not yet limited-priv, but still gets the benefit of not storing root creds on the cluster and some sort of time-based rotation

Cloud providers use different terms for their implementation of this authentication method.

== Component secret formats
The content of the component `Secret` object for a cluster that uses short-term credentials managed outside the cluster differs from the secret format used for long-term credentials.
