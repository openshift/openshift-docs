= Manual mode with short-term credentials for components

:context: cco-short-term-creds

toc::[]

During installation, you can configure the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) to operate in manual mode and use the CCO utility (`ccoctl`) to implement short-term security credentials for individual components that are created and managed outside the {product-title} cluster.

[NOTE]
====
This credentials strategy is supported for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and global Microsoft Azure only. The strategy must be configured during installation of a new {product-title} cluster. You cannot configure an existing cluster that uses a different credentials strategy to use this feature.
====

//todo: Should provide some more info about the benefits of this here as well. Note: Azure is not yet limited-priv, but still gets the benefit of not storing root creds on the cluster and some sort of time-based rotation

Cloud providers use different terms for their implementation of this authentication method.

== AWS Security Token Service

In manual mode with STS, the individual {product-title} cluster components use the AWS Security Token Service (STS) to assign components IAM roles that provide short-term, limited-privilege security credentials. These credentials are associated with IAM roles that are specific to each component that makes AWS API calls.

== GCP Workload Identity

In manual mode with GCP Workload Identity, the individual {product-title} cluster components use the GCP workload identity provider to allow components to impersonate GCP service accounts using short-term, limited-privilege credentials.
