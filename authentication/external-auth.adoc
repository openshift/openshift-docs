toc::[]

While the built-in OpenShift OAuth server supports integration with a variety of identity providers, including external OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers, it is limited to the capabilities of the OAuth server itself. You can configure {product-title} to use an external OIDC identity provider directly to issue tokens for authentication, which replaces the built-in OpenShift OAuth server.
