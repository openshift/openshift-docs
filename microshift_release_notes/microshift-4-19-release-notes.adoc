{product-title-first} provides developers and IT organizations with small-form-factor and edge computing delivered as an application that customers can deploy on top of their managed {op-system-base-full} devices at the edge. Built on {OCP} and Kubernetes, {microshift-short} provides an efficient way to operate single-node clusters in low-resource edge environments.

{microshift-short} is designed to make control plane restarts economical and be lifecycle-managed as a single unit by the operating system. Updates, roll-backs, and configuration changes consist of simply staging another version in parallel and then - without relying on a network - flipping to and from that version and restarting.

[id="microshift-4-19-about-this-release_{context}"]

[id="microshift-4-19-ingress-controller-two-config_{context}"]
==== Control ingress for your use case with additional parameters
With this release, the `ingress.certificate.Secret`,`ingress.clientTLS`, `ingress.routeAdmissionPolicy`, and `ingress.tlsSecurityProfile` parameters are added to the YAML configuration file for {microshift-short}. These parameters specify security settings for the ingress controller. For more information, see xref:../microshift_configuring/microshift-ingress-controller.adoc#microshift-ingress-controller[Using ingress control for a {microshift-short} cluster].

[id="microshift-4-19-tls-config_{context}"]
==== {microshift-short} control plane enhanced with TLS
With this release, configurable transport layer security (TLS) protocols on internal control plane components are enabled to help prevent known insecure protocols, ciphers, or algorithms from accessing the applications you run on {microshift-short}. You use either the TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 with {microshift-short}. For more information, see xref:../microshift_configuring/microshift_auth_security/microshift-tls-config.adoc#microshift-tls-config[Configuring TLS security profiles].
