toc::[]

{product-title-first} provides developers and IT organizations with small-form-factor and edge computing delivered as an application that customers can deploy on top of their managed {op-system-base-full} devices at the edge. Built on {OCP} and Kubernetes, {microshift-short} provides an efficient way to operate single-node clusters in low-resource edge environments.

{microshift-short} is designed to make control plane restarts economical and be lifecycle-managed as a single unit by the operating system. Updates, roll-backs, and configuration changes consist of simply staging another version in parallel and then - without relying on a network - flipping to and from that version and restarting.

[id="microshift-4-19-about-this-release_{context}"]
== About this release
Version {product-version} of {microshift-short} includes new features and enhancements. Update to the latest version of {microshift-short} to receive all of the latest features, bug fixes, and security updates. {microshift-short} is derived from {OCP} {ocp-version} and uses the CRI-O container runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {microshift-short} are included in this topic.

You can deploy {microshift-short} clusters to on-premise, cloud, disconnected, and offline environments.

{microshift-short} {product-version} is supported on {op-system-base-full} 9.6.

[id="microshift-4-19-rhel-image-mode_{context}"]
==== {op-system-base} image mode (General Availablity)
Installing {microshift-short} by using a bootc container image is now generally available. Previously available as a Technology Preview feature, {op-system-image} is a deployment method that uses a container-native approach to build, deploy, and manage the operating system as a `rhel-bootc` container image. See xref:../microshift_install_bootc/microshift-about-rhel-image-mode.adoc#microshift-about-rhel-image-mode[Understanding image mode for RHEL with {microshift-short}] for more information.

//4.19 is not an EUS release
[id="microshift-4-19-updating_{context}"]
=== Updating
Updates for both single-version minor releases and patch releases are supported. See xref:../microshift_updating/microshift-update-options.adoc#microshift-update-options[Update options with {product-title} and {op-system-bundle}] for details.

//TODO add new features and enhancements as needed, follow doc TOC titles as L3s, then add L4 headings for each feature
