toc::[]

{product-title-first} provides developers and IT organizations with small-form-factor and edge computing delivered as an application that customers can deploy on top of their managed {op-system-base-full} devices at the edge. Built on {OCP} and Kubernetes, {microshift-short} provides an efficient way to operate single-node clusters in low-resource edge environments.

{microshift-short} is designed to make control plane restarts economical and be lifecycle-managed as a single unit by the operating system. Updates, roll-backs, and configuration changes consist of simply staging another version in parallel and then - without relying on a network - flipping to and from that version and restarting.

[id="microshift-4-19-about-this-release_{context}"]

=== Updating
Updates for both single-version minor releases and patch releases are supported. See xref:../microshift_updating/microshift-update-options.adoc#microshift-update-options[Update options with {product-title} and {op-system-bundle}] for details.

//TODO add new features and enhancements as needed, follow doc TOC titles as L3s, then add L4 headings for each feature

[id="microshift-4-19-configuring_{context}"]
=== Configuring

[id="microshift-4-19-ingress-controller-two-config_{context}"]
==== Control ingress for your use case with additional parameters

With this release, the `ingress.certificate.Secret`,`ingress.clientTLS`, `ingress.routeAdmissionPolicy`, and `ingress.tlsSecurityProfile` parameters are added to the YAML configuration file for {microshift-short}. These parameters specify security settings for the ingress controller. For more information, see xref:../microshift_configuring/microshift-ingress-controller.adoc#microshift-ingress-controller[Using ingress control for a {microshift-short} cluster].

[id="microshift-4-19-tls-config_{context}"]
==== {microshift-short} control plane enhanced with TLS

With this release, configurable transport layer security (TLS) protocols on internal control plane components are enabled to help prevent known insecure protocols, ciphers, or algorithms from accessing the applications you run on {microshift-short}. You use either the TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 with {microshift-short}. For more information, see xref:../microshift_configuring/microshift_auth_security/microshift-tls-config.adoc#microshift-tls-config[Configuring TLS security profiles].

[id="microshift-4-19-running-apps_{context}"]

* `lvmsDriverShouldExist`
* `csiComponentShouldBeDeploy`

//NOTE: Do NOT repeat bug fixes already noted in previous version z-streams
[id="microshift-4-19-bug-fixes_{context}"]
== Bug fixes

* Before this update, using `microshift-gitops` in a disconnected environment failed because its manifests had the `imagePullPolicy` set to `Always`. In these cases, GitOps tried to pull images over a non-existent network and failed with an `ImagePullBackoff` error. With this update, the `imagePullPolicy` is set to `IfNotPresent`, which means that GitOps uses a local image and can start normally. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-37938[OCPBUGS-37938])

* Previously, specific cipher suites required by {microshift-short} etcd when using TLS 1.2 were not included in the {microshift-short} startup configuration file. As a result, {microshift-short} failed to start when using TLS 1.2. With this release, the required cipher suites are in the configuration file by default and {microshift-short} can start normally when using TLS 1.2. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-48735[OCPBUGS-48735])

* Previously, a `.nodename` file that holds the last hostname was created by MicroShift on startup non-atomically. When MicroShift's startup was interrupted, the `.nodename` file was left behind empty. This `.nodename` file was used on the next MicroShift startup, causing the node name to stored as an empty string. This caused the API Server to reject the kubelet's calls and the start up failed. With this release, the `.nodename` file is created atomically with each MicroShift start up, preventing the error. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-48163[OCPBUGS-48163])

* By default, the {microshift-short} Logical Volume Manager Storage (LVMS) image copied the manifest list for four platforms because of automatic digest preservation. This action caused unnecessary usage of disk and network space. With this release, the manifest list is replaced with images specific to each architecture. Now, the {microshift-short} LVMS images only contain supported platform images, saving on disk space and network bandwidth. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-51329[OCPBUGS-51329])

* Previously, the `kustomizer` sub-service was blocking `microshift.service` readiness by adding a manifest that required a webhook for a Custom Resource (CR) before {microshift-short} had started. This resulted `kustomizer` failing, causing {microshift-short} to fail. With this release, {microshift-short} is no longer dependent on the `kustomizer` sub-service, and can start even if a manifest is malformed by `kustomizer`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-51365[OCPBUGS-51365])

* In previous versions of {microshift-short} and {op-system-base}, the {microshift-short} container-image-embedding procedure used the default container storage directory, which prevented proper image updates. With this release, the recommended image-embedding procedure was changed to use a dedicated directory for each image and a systemd service copying those embedded images into the default container storage. As a result, updates for {op-system-image} are applied as expected with {microshift-short} and embedded containers. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-52420[OCPBUGS-52420])

[id="microshift-4-19-known-issues_{context}"]
== Known issues

* The maximum transmission unit (MTU) value in {microshift-short} OVN-K overlay networking must be 100 bytes smaller than the MTU value of the base network. {microshift-short} automatically configures the value using the MTU value of the default gateway of the host. If the auto-configuration does not work correctly, the MTU value must be configured manually. For more information, see xref:../microshift_networking/microshift-cni.adoc#microshift-network-topology_microshift-about-ovn-k-plugin[Network topology].
