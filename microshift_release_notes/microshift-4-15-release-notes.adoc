toc::[]

{product-title-first} provides developers and IT organizations with small-form-factor and edge computing delivered as an application that customers can deploy on top of their managed {op-system-base-full} devices at the edge. Built on {OCP} and Kubernetes, {microshift-short} provides an efficient way to operate single-node clusters in low-resource edge environments.

{microshift-short} is designed to make control plane restarts economical and be lifecycle-managed as a single unit by the operating system. Updates, roll-backs, and configuration changes consist of simply staging another version in parallel and then - without relying on a network - flipping to and from that version and restarting.

[id="microshift-4-15-about-this-release"]
== About this release
Version 4.15 of {product-title} includes new features and enhancements. {microshift-short} was introduced as Generally Available with {microshift-short} 4.14. Update to the latest version of {microshift-short} to receive all of the latest features, bug fixes, and security updates. This release uses link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.28.md[Kubernetes 1.28] with the CRI-O container runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {microshift-short} are included in this topic.

You can deploy {microshift-short} clusters to either on-premise, cloud, or disconnected environments.

{microshift-short} {product-version} is supported on {op-system-ostree-first} and {op-system-base-full} 9.2 and 9.3.

For lifecycle information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/product-life-cycles?product=Red%20Hat%20build%20of%20Microshift,Red%20Hat%20Device%20Edge[{product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

[id="microshift-4-15-new-features-and-enhancements"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

//L3 major categories with features in each as L4s, for example:
[id="microshift-4-15-rhel"]
=== {op-system-base-full}
* {microshift-short} now runs on {op-system-base-full} versions 9.2 and 9.3. Compatibility with {op-system} 9.3 is an enhancement for {microshift-short} version 4.15.

// Some details of the next note are adapted from https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/08/31/cgroupv2-ga-1-25/
* {microshift-short} uses crun and Control Group v2 (cgroup v2). If workloads rely on the cgroup file system layout, they might need to be updated to be compatible with cgroup v2.

** If you run third-party monitoring and security agents that depend on the cgroup file system, update the agents to versions that support cgroup v2.
** If you run cAdvisor as a standalone DaemonSet for monitoring pods and containers, update it to v0.43.0 or later.
** If you deploy Java applications with JDK, ensure you are using JDK 11.0.16 and later or JDK 15 and later, which fully support cgroup v2.

[id="microshift-4-15-updating"]
=== Updating
Updates for both minor releases and patch releases are supported.

[id="microshift-4-15-updates-supported"]
==== The following updates are supported
The following list provides update details:

* {microshift-short} offers in-place updates on {op-system-ostree} systems with automatic system rollback capabilities and automatic back up and restore functions.
* Updates of the RPMs on a non-OSTree system such as {op-system} are also supported.
* Updates from the 4.14 version are supported.

[id="microshift-4-15-version-logs-at-start"]
==== Version logged at start up
Previously, {microshift-short} did not log its version at start up. The absence of version information made debugging certain scenarios difficult because the update path was unknown. Now, the {microshift-short} version is logged at start up and available with commands such as `journalctl -u microshift | grep "Version"`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-19540[*OCPBUGS-19540*])

[id="microshift-4-15-installation"]
=== Installation

[id="microshift-4-15-blueprint-included"]
==== Sample blueprints now included
The `microshift-release-info` RPM now contains sample blueprints that can be used for image building. The blueprints include both {microshift-short} RPM packages and container image references. See xref:../microshift_install/microshift-embed-in-rpm-ostree.adoc#adding-microshift-service-to-blueprint_microshift-embed-in-rpm-ostree[Adding the {microshift-short} service to a blueprint] for more information.

[id="microshift-4-15-support"]
=== Support

[id="microshift-4-15-etcd"]
==== Getting the etcd version
Previously, you could not query for the etcd version included with {microshift-short}.

[id="microshift-4-15-bug-fixes"]
== Bug fixes

[discrete]
[id="microshift-4-15-installation-bug-fixes"]
=== Installation
* Previously, the `microshift-release-info` RPM depended on the `microshift` RPM. With this release, you can download and install the `microshift-release-info` RPM independently for use in image building. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-22854[*OCPBUGS-22854*])

* Previously, the Greenboot health check script printed outputs for some checks that were not picked up by `journald`, resulting in missing log entries when running the `journalctl -u greenboot-healthcheck` command. With this release, the production of logs by the Greenboot healthcheck has been fixed so that all outputs are linked to the `systemd` unit, making them easily available to read. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-20037[*OCPBUGS-20037*])

* Previously, the {microshift-short} clean-up script failed if CRI-O services were not present or not running. This prevented {microshift-short} and its dependencies from fully uninstalling. It also prevented the clean-up script from running on a system with a new installation of the `microshift` RPM that had not started. With this release, the {microshift-short} clean-up script skips the CRI-O steps if the service is not running, reports that status, and continues with clean-up activities. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-22936[*OCPBUGS-22936*])

* Previously, the Greenboot health check reported a `RED` status when the Logical Volume Manager Storage (LVMS) component was disabled because no volume groups (VGs) were present. Because volume groups are not required for {microshift-short}, the health check should report `GREEN` without VGs. Now, when LVMS is disabled, the Greenboot health check skips the check for the `openshift-storage` namespace and reports `GREEN` status. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-25689[*OCPBUGS-25689*])

[discrete]
[id="microshift-4-15-networking-bug-fixes"]
=== Networking
* Whenever `advertiseAddress` is configured with an IP address, any network interfaces must also be configured. Previously, manually setting the `advertiseAddress` in the {microshift-short} `config.yaml` to the IP address value that is expected to be set by default, but not manually setting the same IP address for the `br-ex` network bridge on the host, caused the `ovnkube-master` container in the `ovnkube-master` pod to crash. With this release, the {microshift-short} service verifies whether `advertiseAddress` is set in the `config.yaml` and whether any interface has the same IP address set. If the two settings are not the same, {microshift-short} prints an error, for example, `Advertise address: %s not present in any interface, advertiseAddress` and fails. This helps ensure the proper configuration before the system starts. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-27398[*OCPBUGS-27398*])

[discrete]
[id="microshift-4-15-support-bug-fixes"]
=== Support
* Previously, `sos` reports created journal logs in separate files, making it difficult to correlate {microshift-short} and the Greenboot health check. Now the {microshift-short} `sos` tool includes a full system journal with an aggregated view in the same log. With this update, you can see one log with a detailed report that shows all of the enabled plugins and data from the different components and applications.

[discrete]
[id="microshift-4-15-2-bug-fixes"]
==== Bug fixes

FIPS mode::
* Previously, {microshift-short} used a version of the logical volume manager storage (LVMS) Container Storage Interface (CSI) provider that was not designed for FIPS compliance. This caused {microshift-short} to fail a FIPS validation test. With this release, the LVMS version 4.15.0 is used as the default CSI storage provider and validation passes.

* When a {op-system-base-full} version that uses FIPS libraries is installed and started with FIPS enabled, {microshift-short} containers are automatically enabled to run in FIPS mode. See xref:../microshift_install/microshift-fips.adoc#microshift-fips[Running {microshift-short} containers in FIPS mode].

* Update to the 4.15.2 release to apply this fix for FIPS mode.

[discrete]
[id="microshift-4-15-2-enhancements"]
==== Enhancements

Adds OLM image references in dedicated file::
* Previously, image references for embedding MicroShift OLM in a RHEL for Edge image were part of the `microshift-olm` RPM package. The application package had to be downloaded and run to retrieve the information. With this release, image references are now in the dedicated `microshift-olm-release-info` RPM package for easier use. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29246[OCPBUGS-29246])
