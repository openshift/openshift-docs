{product-title} provides developers and IT organizations with small-form-factor and edge computing, delivered as an application that customers can deploy on top of their managed {op-system-base-full} devices at the edge. Built on {OCP} and Kubernetes, {microshift-short} provides an efficient way to operate single-node clusters in low-resource edge environments.

{microshift-short} is designed to make control plane restarts economical and be lifecycle-managed as a single unit by the operating system. Updates, roll-backs, and configuration changes consist of simply staging another version in parallel and then - without relying on a network - flipping to and from that version and restarting.

== About this release
// TODO: Update with the relevant information closer to release.
Version 4.15 of {microshift-short} includes new features and enhancements. {microshift-short} was introduced as Generally Available with {microshift-short} 4.14. You should plan to update to the latest version of {microshift-short} to receive all of the latest features, bug fixes, and security updates. This release uses link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.27.md[Kubernetes 1.27] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} {microshift-short} are included in this topic.

You can deploy {microshift-short} clusters to either on-premise, cloud, or disconnected environments.

// Double check OP system versions
{microshift-short} {product-version} is supported on {op-system-ostree-first} and {op-system-base-full} 9.2 and 9.3.

//TODO: update link after GA; KCS article will not be live until then
//For lifecycle information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

//L3 major categories with features in each as L4s, for example:
[id="microshift-4-15-rhel"]
=== {op-system-base-full} {op-system-version}
* {microshift-short} runs on {op-system-base-full} versions 9.2 and 9.3.

// Some details of the next note are adapted from https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/08/31/cgroupv2-ga-1-25/
* {microshift-short} uses crun and Control Group v2 (cgroup v2). {OCP} {ocp-version} defaults to Control Group v1. The divergence of control group versions is not anticipated to have a noticeable behavior difference on most workloads. If workloads rely on the cgroup file system layout, they may need to be updated to be compatible with cgroup v2.

** If you run third-party monitoring and security agents that depend on the cgroup file system, update the agents to versions that support cgroup v2.
** If you run cAdvisor as a standalone DaemonSet for monitoring pods and containers, update it to v0.43.0 or later.
** If you deploy Java applications with the JDK, ensure you are using JDK 11.0.16 and later or JDK 15 and later, which fully support cgroup v2.

//[id="microshift-4-15-known-issues"]
//== Known issues

//* OVN-Kubernetes sets up an iptable chain in the network address translation (NAT) table to handle incoming traffic to the NodePort service. When the NodePort service is not reachable or the connection is refused, check the iptable rules on the host to make sure the relevant rules are properly inserted.
//+
//. View the iptable rules for the NodePort service by running the following command:
//+
//[source, terminal]
//----
//$ sudo iptables-save | grep NODEPORT
//----
//+
//.Example output
//[source, terminal]
//----
//-A OUTPUT -j OVN-KUBE-NODEPORT
//-A OVN-KUBE-NODEPORT -p tcp -m addrtype --dst-type LOCAL -m tcp --dport 30326 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.43.95.170:80
//----
//OVN-Kubernetes configures the `OVN-KUBE-NODEPORT` iptable chain in the NAT table to match the packet with the destination port and Destination Network Address Translates (DNATs) the packet to the `clusterIP` service. The packet is then routed to the OVN network through the gateway bridge `br-ex` using routing rules on the host.
//+
//. View the hosts routing table by running the following command:
//+
//[source, terminal]
//----
//$ ip route
//----
//+
//.Example output
//[source, terminal]
//----
//10.43.0.0/16 via 192.168.122.1 dev br-ex mtu 1400
//----
//This routing rule matches the Kubernetes service IP address range and forwards the packet to the gateway bridge `br-ex`. You must enable `ip_forward` on the host. After the packet is forwarded to the OVS bridge `br-ex`, it is handled by OpenFlow rules in OVS. OpenFlow then steers the packet to the OVN network and eventually to the pod.
