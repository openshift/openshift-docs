{product-title-first} provides developers and IT organizations with small-form-factor and edge computing delivered as an application that customers can deploy on top of their managed {op-system-base-full} devices at the edge. Built on {OCP} and Kubernetes, {microshift-short} provides an efficient way to operate a single node in low-resource edge environments.

{microshift-short} is designed to make control plane restarts economical and be lifecycle-managed as a single unit by the operating system. Updates, roll-backs, and configuration changes consist of simply staging another version in parallel and then - without relying on a network - flipping to and from that version and restarting.

[id="microshift-4-20-new-features-and-enhancements_{context}"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

//4.20 is an EUS release, so two minor version updates are supported
[id="microshift-4-20-updating_{context}"]
=== Updating

Updating two minor EUS versions in a single step is supported in {product-version}. Updates for both single-version minor releases and patch releases are also supported. See xref:../microshift_updating/microshift-update-options.adoc#microshift-update-options[Update options with {product-title} and {op-system-bundle}] for details.

//TODO add new features and enhancements as needed, follow doc TOC titles as L3s, then add L4 headings for each feature
[id="microshift-4-20-configuring_{context}"]
=== Configuring {microshift-short}

[id="microshift-4-20-ingress-controller-three-config_{context}"]
==== Inspect ingress for your use case with additional logging parameters

With this release, you can configure custom error code pages and logging parameters in the router, and you can capture HTTP headers and cookies in the ingress controller access logs.

[id="microshift-4-20-install-cert-manager_{context}"]
==== The cert manager Operator is now available with {microshift-short}

With this release, {microshift-short} users can securely manage certificates for their components by using the cert-manager Operator. This enhancement automates the issuance and renewal of SSL/TLS certificates, enhancing data protection and ensuring regulatory compliance. It enables standardized certificate management, enhances node security, and results in more secure and standardized communication within and between user services. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/security_and_compliance/cert-manager-operator-for-red-hat-openshift[cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift].

[id="microshift-4-20-tech-preview_{context}"]
== Technology Preview features

Some features in this release are currently in Technology Preview. These experimental features are not intended for production use. Note the following scope of support on the Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal for these features:

link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview Features Support Scope]

[id="microshift-4-20-Generic-Device-Plugin_{context}"]
=== Generic Device Plugin feature

The Generic Device Plugin (GDP) is a Kubernetes device plugin that enables applications running in pods to access host devices such as serial ports, cameras, and sound cards securely. This Technology Preview capability is especially important for edge and IoT environments where direct hardware interaction is a common requirement. The GDP integrates with the kubelet to advertise available devices to the node and facilitate their allocation to pods without requiring elevated privileges within the container itself.

[id="microshift-4-20-ai_{context}"]
=== Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift AI with {microshift-short}

With this release, you can access the most recent updates and improvements to supported Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) model-serving releases. The latest RHOAI release improves compatibility with the new Hugging Face Model Detector and Variable Length Language Model (VLLM) runtimes.

//NOTE: Do NOT repeat bug fixes already noted in previous version z-streams
[id="microshift-4-20-bug-fixes_{context}"]
== Bug fixes

* Before this update, embedding container images into a bootc build could fail because HTTP proxy environment variables were defined in the bootc image. Proxy errors occurred during container image embedding and prevented successful builds. With this release, the bootc image no longer sets HTTP proxy environment variables, thereby eliminating the issue. As a result, you can now embed container images without encountering proxy errors. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-61433[OCPBUGS-61433])

* Before this update, a bare-metal node reboot caused the deployment progress deadline to be surpassed. This resulted in the greenboot health check failing with a false-positive error. With this release, the `ProgressDeadlineExceeded` condition for deployments is removed to allow time for reboots that exceed the default time limit. Now, the full timeout duration is provided for the deployment to become ready, reducing false-positive greenboot health check errors. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-59175[OCPBUGS-59175])

* Before this update, duplicated dependencies and firewall configurations were included in blueprints. This update streamlines blueprint installation by eliminating unnecessary packages and firewall configurations, enhancing efficiency. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-55818[OCPBUGS-55818])

* Before this update, the ROUTER_ENABLE_EXTERNAL_CERTIFICATE environment variable was not set by default, despite the Route `ExternalCertificate` feature being supported in {microshift-short}. Because of this, you could not configure routes with third-party certificate management solutions by using the `.spec.tls.externalCertificate` field of the route API. With this release, the environment variable value is set to `True` and the Route `ExternalCertificate` feature is enabled. You can reference externally managed TLS certificates through secrets, eliminating the need for manual certificate management. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-58357[OCPBUGS-58357])
** For more information, see also https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/ingress_and_load_balancing/configuring-routes#nw-ingress-route-secret-load-external-cert_secured-routes[Creating a route with externally managed certificates].

* Before this update, the lack of an {OCP} pull-secret caused excessive telemetry collection failure logs. As a consequence, telemetry errors flooded the journald logs With this release, the telemetry pull secret error rate is reduced. As a result, telemetry collection messages no longer flood the logs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-57777[OCPBUGS-57777])

* In this release, the backend implementation of the observability YAML file is streamlined to prevent accidental overwriting of custom observability configuration when you update {microshift-short}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-56157[OCPBUGS-56157])

[id="microshift-4-20-known-issues_{context}"]
== Known issues

* The maximum transmission unit (MTU) value in {microshift-short} OVN-K overlay networking must be 100 bytes smaller than the MTU value of the base network. {microshift-short} automatically configures the value using the MTU value of the default gateway of the host. If the auto-configuration does not work correctly, you must configure the the MTU value manually. For more information, see xref:../microshift_networking/microshift-cni.adoc#microshift-network-topology_microshift-about-ovn-k-plugin[Network topology].
