toc::[]

{product-title} provides developers and IT organizations with small-form-factor and edge computing delivered as an application that customers can deploy on top of their managed {op-system-base-full} devices at the edge. Built on {OCP} and Kubernetes, {microshift-short} provides an efficient way to operate single-node clusters in low-resource edge environments.

{microshift-short} is designed to make control plane restarts economical and be lifecycle-managed as a single unit by the operating system. Updates, roll-backs, and configuration changes consist of simply staging another version in parallel and then - without relying on a network - flipping to and from that version and restarting.

[id="microshift-4-16-about-this-release_{context}"]
== About this release
Version 4.16 of {product-title} includes new features and enhancements. {microshift-short} was introduced as Generally Available with {microshift-short} 4.14. Update to the latest version of {microshift-short} to receive all of the latest features, bug fixes, and security updates. {microshift-short} is derived from {OCP} {OCP-version} and uses the CRI-O container runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {microshift-short} are included in this topic.

You can deploy {microshift-short} clusters to on-premise, cloud, disconnected, and offline environments.

{microshift-short} {product-version} is supported on {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-ostree-first} 9.4.

For lifecycle information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/product-life-cycles?product=Red%20Hat%20build%20of%20Microshift,Red%20Hat%20Device%20Edge[{product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

[id="microshift-4-16-new-features-and-enhancements_{context}"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

//L3 major categories with features in each as L4s
[id="microshift-4-16-rhel_{context}"]
=== {op-system-base-full}
* {microshift-short} {product-version} runs on {op-system-base-full} 9.4.

[id="microshift-4-16-updating_{context}"]
=== Updating
Updating two minor versions in a single step is now supported. Updates for both single-version minor releases and patch releases are still supported.

[id="microshift-4-16-updates-supported_{context}"]
==== Update two minor versions in a single step
See the following list for details:

* You can update from one long-life-cycle version of {microshift-short} directly to another, without applying the intermediate version. For example, you can update directly to 4.16 from 4.14. Updating 4.14 to 4.15 before updating to 4.16 is no longer required.
* Now, you can focus on developing applications for your devices in remote locations and with limited bandwidth, rather than planning for updates.
* {microshift-short} offers in-place updates on {op-system-ostree} systems with automatic system rollback capabilities and automatic back up and restore functions.
* Updates of the RPMs on a non-OSTree system such as {op-system} are also supported.
* See xref:../microshift_updating/microshift-update-options.adoc#microshift-update-options[Update options with {product-title} and {op-system-bundle}] for details.

[id="microshift-4-16-configuring_{context}"]
=== Configuring

[id="microshift-4-16-custom-cert-auths_{context}"]
==== Customizable certificate authorities for the API server are supported
With this release, you can configure a custom server certificate that has been issued by an external certificate authority (CA). The default API server certificate is issued by an internal {microshift-short} cluster CA. You can now replace this certificate with one that is issued by a CA that clients trust. See xref:../microshift_configuring/microshift-custom-ca.adoc#microshift-custom-ca[Configuring custom certificate authorities].

[id="microshift-4-16-audit-logging-config_{context}"]
==== Configurable policies for log file rotation and retention
You can now configure audit logging policies to manage the retention policies for log files, ensuring that edge devices with limited storage capacities are not hampered by accumulated logging data. To configure audit log policies, use settings such as a maximum file size limit and maximum retained files to set a limit on log storage size. You can also choose an audit policy profile to specify the data collected. See xref:../microshift_configuring/microshift-audit-logs-config.adoc#microshift-audit-logs-config[Configuring audit logs].

[id="microshift-4-16-certificates-cleaning_{context}"]
==== Support for cleaning up certificates
With this release, you can clean up custom certificates. For more information, see xref:../microshift_configuring/microshift-custom-ca.adoc#microshift-custom-ca-certificates-cleaning_microshift-custom-ca[Cleaning up and recreating the custom certificates].

[id="microshift-4-16-networking_{context}"]
=== Networking

[id="microshift-4-16-multus_{context}"]
==== Multiple networks capability now available
With this release, using multiple networks is supported with the {microshift-short} Multus plugin. If you have advanced networking requirements, you can attach additional networks to a pod for high-performance network configurations. After installing the {microshift-short} Multus RPM package, you can use the Bridge, MACVLAN, or IPVLAN plugins to create additional networks. See xref:../microshift_networking/microshift_multiple_networks/microshift-cni-multus.adoc#microshift-multus-intro_microshift-cni-multus[Additional networks in {microshift-short}].

[id="microshift-4-16-configure-ingress-router_{context}"]
==== Custom configurations for the ingress router are supported
You can now configure ingress routes to create access to multiple services inside your {microshift-short} cluster. You can use a variety of combinations to customize the endpoint configuration for your use case. See xref:../microshift_networking/microshift-nw-router.adoc#microshift-nw-router-con_microshift-nw-router[About configuring the router].

[id="microshift-4-16-configure-route-admission-policy_{context}"]
==== Configuring the route admission policy now available
You can now configure the route admission policy to allow routes to claim different paths of the same hostname across namespaces. See xref:../microshift_networking/microshift-nw-router.adoc#microshift-configuring-route-admission_microshift-nw-router[Configuring the route admission policy].

[id="microshift-4-16-running-apps_{context}"]
=== Running applications

[id="microshift-4-16-gitops_{context}"]
==== GitOps with Argo CD now available
With this release, you can use the GitOps with Argo CD agent derived from GitOps 1.12 with {microshift-short}. Using GitOps means you can update a single Git repository and automate the deployment of new applications or updates to existing ones. You can also use your Git repository as an audit trail of changes so that you can create processes such as review and approval for merging pull requests that implement configuration changes.
See xref:../microshift_running_apps/microshift-gitops.adoc#microshift-gitops[Automating application management with the GitOps controller].

[id="microshift-4-16-support_{context}"]
=== Support

[id="microshift-4-16-support-updates_{context}"]
==== Getting a cluster ID
With this release, you can get the ID of a {microshift-short} cluster. When opening a support case, you can provide the cluster ID to Red{nbsp}Hat Support to help in identifying issues with your cluster. See xref:../microshift_support/microshift-getting-cluster-id.adoc#microshift-getting-cluster-id[Getting your cluster ID].

[id="microshift-4-16-security_{context}"]
=== Security and compliance

[id="microshift-4-16-ssl-medium-cipher-suites_{context}"]
==== SSL Medium Strength Cipher Suites now supported
During an SSL handshake between a client and a server, the cipher to use is negotiated between them. With this release, SSL Medium Strength Cipher Suites are now supported for the kube-controller-manager daemon, kube-scheduler control-plane process, and kubelet "node agent." This enhancement to the internal communication between kubernetes components improves control plane communications security. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-29037[OCPBUGS-29037])

[id="microshift-4-16-doc-enhancements_{context}"]
=== Documentation enhancements

[id="microshift-4-16-bug-fixes_{context}"]
== Bug fixes

[discrete]
[id="microshift-4-16-networking-bug-fixes"]
=== Networking

Previously, the {microshift-short} load balancer controller tried to update the IP addresses of every `LoadBalancer` service in the cluster. Some of these services, such as those with a defined `loadBalancerClass`, have their own update procedures for external IPs. This conflicted with the {microshift-short} controller. Now, services that have a `loadBalancerClass` are filtered and IP addresses owned by other load balancer services are ignored by {microshift-short}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-30833[OCPBUGS-30833])

[discrete]
[id="microshift-4-16-support-bug-fixes"]
=== Support

Previously, when `microshift-etcd` unexpectedly exited, {microshift-short} tried to restart so that `microshift-etcd` could restart, but there was a lingering unit fragment. Every attempt to restart `microshift-etcd` failed, making the system unusable. The `--collect` flag was added to the `systemd-run` invocation used to start `microshift-etcd`. The additional flag results in systemd cleaning up the unit fragment even if the unit failed. The system now recovers and restarts. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-33588[OCPBUGS-33588])

[id="microshift-4-16-known-issues_{context}"]
== Known issues

[id="microshift-4-16-pods-writing-files-excess-memory-limits-crash_{context}"]
=== Pods crash when writing files that exceed memory limits
Because of an issue with {op-system-base}, when a pod tries to write files that are larger than configured memory limits to a persistent volume claim, the pod might crash with an out-of-memory error. The pod status shows `OOMKilled` when this occurs. Use the following workarounds to avoid this issue: link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7076169[Pods writing files larger than memory limit to PVCs tend to OOM frequently running on MicroShift](Red Hat Knowledgebase).
