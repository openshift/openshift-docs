{product-title-first} provides developers and IT organizations with small-form-factor and edge computing delivered as an application that customers can deploy on top of their managed {op-system-base-full} devices at the edge. Built on {OCP} and Kubernetes, {microshift-short} provides an efficient way to operate single-node clusters in low-resource edge environments.

{microshift-short} is designed to make control plane restarts economical and be lifecycle-managed as a single unit by the operating system. Updates, roll-backs, and configuration changes consist of simply staging another version in parallel and then - without relying on a network - flipping to and from that version and restarting.

[id="microshift-4-18-about-this-release_{context}"]
== About this release

link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview Features Support Scope]

[id="microshift-4-18-rhel-image-mode_{context}"]
=== {op-system-base-full} image mode Technology Preview feature
* You can install {microshift-short} using a `bootc` container image. Image mode for {op-system-base} is a Technology Preview deployment method that uses a container-native approach to build, deploy and manage the operating system as a bootc container image.
+
See xref:../microshift_install_bootc/microshift-install-bootc-image.adoc#microshift-install-publish-bootc-image[Using image mode for RHEL with {microshift-short}] for more information.

[id="microshift-4-18-rhel-image-mode-image_{context}"]
==== Image mode for RHEL image added for use with {microshift-short}
* New for 20 March 2025: A `microshift-bootc` image is now available at the Red{nbsp}Hat Ecosystem catalog. For more information, see xref:../microshift_install_bootc/microshift-install-bootc-image.adoc#microshift-install-publish-bootc-image[Installing and publishing a bootc image to a registry].

[id="microshift-4-18-deprecated-and-removed-features_{context}"]
== Deprecated and removed features
With this release, the CSI snapshot webhook feature available in previous releases is removed. The webhook is replaced by CEL validation rules for snapshot objects.

//NOTE: Do NOT repeat bug fixes already noted in previous version z-streams
[id="microshift-4-18-bug-fixes_{context}"]
== Bug fixes

[discrete]
[id="microshift-4-18-installation-bug-fixes"]
=== Installation
Previously, the greenboot health check marked some healthy Image mode for {op-system-base} systems as unhealthy due to a 300-second timeout, which was insufficient for systems with slow networks. Beginning in {product-title} 4.18, the default greenboot wait timeout has been extended to 600 seconds to provide more time to download images and ensure accurate system checks. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-47463[OCPBUGS-47463])

[id="microshift-4-18-1-known-issue_{context}"]
==== Known issue

* A failed greenboot health check flag does not clear when an RPM-install-based {microshift-short} service is updated without rebooting the system. As a consequence, greenboot health checks for optional components continue to fail because the `systemctl restart greenboot-healthcheck.service` command fails while the flag is present. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-51198[OCPBUGS-51198])

[id="microshift-4-18-2-bugs_{context}"]
==== Bug fix

* Previously, a failed greenboot health check flag did not clear when an RPM-install-based {microshift-short} service was updated without rebooting the system. As a consequence, greenboot health checks for optional components continue to fail because the `systemctl restart greenboot-healthcheck.service` command fails while the flag is present. With this release, the primary {microshift-short} greenboot health check clears the condition that causes optional component health checks to continue to fail.

[id="microshift-4-18-11-bugs_{context}"]
==== Bug fixes

* Previously, {microshift-short} could fail to start on a host without the hostname RPM package installed. With this release, the hostname RPM package is pulled as a dependency during installation. This change means that the hostname RPM package is now required when building the {microshift-short} system, preventing this type of startup failure.  (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-54448[OCPBUGS-54448])

* In some cases, {microshift-short} did not start when using the default configuration file shipped in the {microshift-short} RPM because certain required values were missing. These values are now added to the default `config.yaml` file to avoid this problem and {microshift-short} starts as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-53026[OCPBUGS-53026])

* Previously, when embedding container images during a bootc build procedure, extended attributes were discarded, preventing the router pod from connecting to default `haproxy` ports. With this release, extended attributes are kept for container layers that are embedded into container images. As a result, the bootc container router pod starts normally. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-42010[OCPBUGS-42010])
