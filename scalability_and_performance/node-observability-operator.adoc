toc::[]

The Node Observability Operator collects and stores CRI-O and Kubelet profiling or metrics from scripts of compute nodes.

With the Node Observability Operator, you can query the profiling data, enabling analysis of performance trends in CRI-O and Kubelet. It supports debugging performance-related issues and executing embedded scripts for network metrics by using the `run` field in the custom resource definition. To enable CRI-O and Kubelet profiling or scripting, you can configure the `type` field in the custom resource definition.

== Node Observability Operator scripting

Scripting allows you to run pre-configured bash scripts, using the current Node Observability Operator and Node Observability Agent.

These scripts monitor key metrics like CPU load, memory pressure, and worker node issues. They also collect sar reports and custom performance metrics.
