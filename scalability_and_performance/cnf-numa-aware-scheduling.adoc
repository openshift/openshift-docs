toc::[]

Learn about NUMA-aware scheduling and how you can use it to deploy high performance workloads in an {product-title} cluster.

:FeatureName: NUMA-aware scheduling

The NUMA Resources Operator allows you to schedule high-performance workloads in the same NUMA zone. It deploys a node resources exporting agent that reports on available cluster node NUMA resources, and a secondary scheduler that manages the workloads.
