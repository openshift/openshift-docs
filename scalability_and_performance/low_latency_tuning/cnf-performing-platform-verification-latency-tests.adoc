You can use the Cloud-native Network Functions (CNF) tests image to run latency tests on a CNF-enabled {product-title} cluster, where all the components required for running CNF workloads are installed. Run the latency tests to validate node tuning for your workload.

The `cnf-tests` container image is available at `registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel8:v{product-version}`.

[id="cnf-latency-tests-prerequisites_{context}"]
== Prerequisites for running latency tests

Your cluster must meet the following requirements before you can run the latency tests:

. You have configured a performance profile with the Node Tuning Operator.

. You have applied all the required CNF configurations in the cluster.

. You have a pre-existing `MachineConfigPool` CR applied in the cluster. The default worker pool is `worker-cnf`.
