CPU Manager manages groups of CPUs and constrains workloads to specific CPUs.

CPU Manager is useful for workloads that have some of these attributes:

* Require as much CPU time as possible.
* Are sensitive to processor cache misses.
* Are low-latency network applications.
* Coordinate with other processes and benefit from sharing a single processor
cache.
