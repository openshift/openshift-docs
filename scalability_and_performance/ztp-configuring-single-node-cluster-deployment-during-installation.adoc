toc::[]


The procedures in this topic tell you how to manually deploy clusters on a small number of single nodes as a distributed unit (DU) during installation.

The procedures do not describe how to install single node OpenShift (SNO). This can be accomplished through many mechanisms. Rather, they are intended to capture the elements that should be configured as part of the installation process:

* Networking is needed to enable connectivity to the SNO DU when the installation is complete.

* Workload partitioning, which can only be configured during installation.

* Additional items that help minimize the potential reboots post installation.
