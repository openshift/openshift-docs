toc::[]


The procedures in this topic tell you how to manually deploy clusters on a small number of single nodes as a distributed unit (DU) during installation.

The procedures do not describe how to install {sno}. This can be accomplished through many mechanisms. Rather, they are intended to capture the elements that should be configured as part of the installation process:

* Networking is needed to enable connectivity to the {sno} DU when the installation is complete.

* Workload partitioning, which can only be configured during installation.

* Additional items that help minimize the potential reboots post installation.
