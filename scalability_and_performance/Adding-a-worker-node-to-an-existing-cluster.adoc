1. Retrieve the username and password of the bare metal node’s baseboard management controller. Then, create base64 strings from the username and password. In the following example, the username is root and the password is secretpassword.

echo -ne "root" | base64
echo -ne "secretpassword" | base64

2. Create yaml file with below informaion: 

'''
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: openshift-worker-<num>-bmc-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: <base64-of-uid>
  password: <base64-of-pwd>
---
apiVersion: metal3.io/v1alpha1
kind: BareMetalHost
metadata:
  name: openshift-worker-<num>
spec:
  online: true
  bootMACAddress: <NIC1-mac-address>
  bmc:
    address: ipmi://<bmc-ip>
    credentialsName: openshift-worker-<num>-bmc-secret
'''

3. Replace <num> for the worker number of bare metal node in two name fields and credentialsName field. Replace <base64-of-uid> with the base64 string of the username. Replace <base64-of-pwd> with the base64 string of the password. Replace <NIC1-mac-address> with the MAC address of the bare metal node’s first NIC. Replace <bmc-ip> with the IP address of the bare metal node’s baseboard management controller.
