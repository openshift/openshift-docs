Tune hosted control planes for low latency by applying a performance profile. With the performance profile, you can restrict CPUs for infrastructure and application containers and configure huge pages, Hyper-Threading, and CPU partitions for latency-sensitive processes.

== Creating a performance profile for hosted control planes

You can create a cluster performance profile by using the Performance Profile Creator (PPC) tool. The PPC is a function of the Node Tuning Operator. 

The PPC combines information about your cluster with user-supplied configurations to generate a performance profile that is appropriate to your hardware, topology, and use-case.

The following is a high-level workflow for creating and applying a performance profile in your cluster:

. Gather information about your cluster using the `must-gather` command.

. Use the PPC tool to create a performance profile.

. Apply the performance profile to your cluster.
