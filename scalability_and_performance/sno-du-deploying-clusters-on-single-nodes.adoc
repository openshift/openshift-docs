toc::[]

This procedure tells you how to manually deploy clusters on a small number of single nodes as a
distributed unit (DU) during installation.

This procedure does not describe how to install single node OpenShift (SNO). This can be accomplished
through many mechanisms. Rather, it is intended to capture the elements which should be configured
as part of the installation process:

* Networking is needed to enable connectivity to the SNO DU when the installation is complete.

* Workload partitioning, which can only be configured during installation.

* Additional items that help minimize the potential reboots post installation.
