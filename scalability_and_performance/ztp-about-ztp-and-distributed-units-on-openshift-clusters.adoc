= About ZTP and distributed units on OpenShift clusters

You can install a distributed unit (DU) on a single node cluster at scale with
{rh-rhacm-first using the assisted installer (AI) and
the policy generator with core-reduction technology enabled. The DU installation is done
using zero touch provisioning (ZTP) in a disconnected environment.

{rh-rhacm} manages clusters in a hub and spoke architecture, where a single hub cluster
manages many spoke clusters. {rh-rhacm} applies radio access network (RAN) policies from predefined
custom resources (CRs). Hub clusters running ACM provision and deploy the spoke clusters using
ZTP and AI. DU installation follows the AI installation of OpenShift Container Platform on a single node.

The AI service handles provisioning of {product-name} on single nodes running on bare metal.
{rh-rhacm} ships with and deploys the assisted installer when the MultiClusterHub custom resource is
installed.

With ZTP and AI, you can provision {product-name} single node clusters to run your DUs at scale.
A high level overview of ZTP for distributed units in a disconnected environment is as follows:

* A hub cluster running ACM manages a disconnected internal registry that mirrors the
{product-name} release images. The internal registry is used to provision
the spoke clusters.

* You manage the bare metal host machines for your DUs in an inventory file that uses YAML for formatting.
You store the inventory file in a Git repository.

* You install the DU bare metal host machines on site, and make the hosts ready for provisioning.
To be ready for provisioning, the following is required for each bare metal host:

** Network connectivity - including DNS for your network. Hosts should be reachable through the hub and
managed spoke clusters. Ensure there is layer 3 connectivity between the hub and the host where
you want to install your hub cluster.

** Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) details for each host - ZTP uses BMC details to connect the
URL and credentials for accessing the BMC. ZTP manages the spoke cluster definition CRs, with the
exception of the BMCSecret CR, which you create manually. These define the relevant elements for
the managed clusters.

* When a change is detected in the host inventory repository, a host management event is triggered to
provision the new or updated host.

* The host is provisioned. When the host is provisioned and successfully rebooted, the host agent
reports `Ready` status to the hub cluster.
