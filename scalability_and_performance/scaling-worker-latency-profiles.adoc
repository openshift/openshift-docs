These worker latency profiles are three sets of parameters that are pre-defined with carefully tuned values that control the reaction of the cluster to latency issues  without your needing to determine the best values manually.  

You can configure worker latency profiles when installing a cluster or at any time you notice increased latency in your cluster network.
