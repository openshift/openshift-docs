toc::[]

{rds-caps} clusters are configured as standard three control plane clusters with worker nodes configured with the stock non real-time (RT) kernel.

To support workloads with varying networking and performance requirements, worker nodes are segmented using `MachineConfigPool` CRs. For example, this is done to separate non-user data plane nodes from high-throughput nodes. To support the required telco operational features, the clusters have a standard set of Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) Day 2 Operators installed.

The networking prerequisites for {rds} functions are diverse and encompass an array of networking attributes and performance benchmarks.
IPv6 is mandatory, with dual-stack configurations being prevalent. Certain functions demand maximum throughput and transaction rates, necessitating user plane networking support such as DPDK. Other functions adhere to conventional cloud-native patterns and can use solutions such as OVN-K, kernel networking, and load balancing.
