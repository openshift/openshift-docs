toc::[]

Use zero touch provisioning (ZTP) to provision distributed units at new edge sites in a disconnected environment. The workflow starts when the site is connected to the network and ends with the CNF workload deployed and running on the site nodes.

== Preparing the mirror host

Before you perform the mirror registry procedure, you must prepare the mirror host to retrieve the {product-title} release images.

include::modules/installation-about-mirror-registry.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must have access to the internet to obtain the necessary container images.
In this procedure, you place the mirror registry on a mirror host
that has access to both your network and the Internet. If you do not have access
to a mirror host, use the disconnected procedure to copy images to a device you
can move across network boundaries with.
