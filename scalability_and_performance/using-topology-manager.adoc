Topology Manager collects hints from the CPU Manager, Device Manager, and other Hint Providers to align pod resources, such as CPU, SR-IOV VFs,
and other device resources, for all Quality of Service (QoS) classes on the same non-uniform memory access (NUMA) node.

Topology Manager uses topology information from collected hints to decide if
a pod can be accepted or rejected on a node, based on the configured Topology
Manager policy and Pod resources requested.

Topology Manager is useful for workloads that use hardware accelerators
to support latency-critical execution and high throughput parallel computation.

[NOTE]
====
To use Topology Manager you must use the CPU Manager with the `static` policy. For more information on CPU Manager, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/using-cpu-manager.adoc#using-cpu-manager[Using CPU Manager].
