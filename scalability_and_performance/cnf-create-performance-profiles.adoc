toc::[]

Learn about the Performance Profile Creator (PPC) and how you can use it to create a performance profile.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, disabling CPU load balancing is not supported by cgroup v2. As a result, you might not get the desired behavior from performance profiles if you have cgroup v2 enabled. Enabling cgroup v2 is not recommended if you are using performace profiles.
