You can use the Topology Aware Lifecycle Operator (TALO) to manage the software lifecycle of multiple single node OpenShift (SNO) clusters. TALO uses {rh-rhacm-first} policies to perform changes on the target clusters.

:FeatureName: Topology Aware Lifecycle Operator

[id="cnf-topology-aware-lifecycle-operator-preparations"]
== Requirements for using TALO

To use TALO, you need to set up your environment and your clusters accordingly.

* TALO requires a disconnected environment. For more information, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/ztp-deploying-disconnected.adoc#ztp-acm-preparing-to-install-disconnected-acm_ztp-deploying-disconnected[Preparing the disconnected environment].

* ZTP depends on TALO to configure the cluster. For more information, see xref: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a8FbkK13g-5o5sTJXNSF-oWAR34YRuKoa5rHnYGJRzM/edit#heading=h.tuuop2mc4rq3

== Additional resources

The Topology Aware Lifecycle Operator is supported in a restricted network environment. For more information, see xref:../operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.adoc#olm-restricted-networks[Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks].

The Topology Aware Lifecycle Operator can use `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs for creating policies. For more information, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/ztp-deploying-disconnected.adoc#ztp-the-policygentemplate_ztp-deploying-disconnected[The PolicyGenTemplate].
