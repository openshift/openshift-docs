== Moving resources to infrastructure machine sets

Some of the infrastructure resources are deployed in your cluster by default. You can move them to the infrastructure machine sets that you created.

For information on creating infrastructure nodes, see xref:../post_installation_configuration/cluster-tasks.html#post-install-creating-infrastructure-machinesets-production[Creating infrastructure machine sets for production environments].

include::modules/infrastructure-moving-monitoring.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

If your cluster uses components that monitors user-defined projects, to move these components to an infra node, see xref:../monitoring/configuring-the-monitoring-stack.adoc#moving-monitoring-components-to-different-nodes_configuring-the-monitoring-stack[Moving monitoring components to different nodes].
