=== Selecting a larger Amazon Web Services instance type for control plane machines

If the control plane machines in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) cluster require more resources, you can select a larger AWS instance type for the control plane machines to use.

[NOTE]
====
The procedure for clusters that use a control plane machine set is different than the procedure for clusters that do not use a control plane machine set. 

If you are uncertain about the state of the `ControlPlaneMachineSet` CR in your cluster, you can xref:../machine_management/control_plane_machine_management/cpmso-getting-started.adoc#cpmso-checking-status_cpmso-getting-started[verify the CR status].
