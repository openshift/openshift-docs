Telco edge computing presents extraordinary challenges with managing hundreds to tens of thousands of clusters in hundreds of thousands of locations. These challenges require fully-automated management solutions with, as closely as possible, zero human interaction.

Zero touch provisioning addresses the problem of provisioning new telco sites from the moment there is network connectivity to the site and until the CNF workload is deployed and running on the site nodes.

ZTP eliminates the need for service providers to manually configure bare metal equipment at remote sites. Manual intervention is eliminated.  Declarative frameworks of desired end states are pushed out into the environment. Template or overlay configurations install {product-title} features that are required for CNF workloads and an end-to-end functional test suite to verify CNF related features. All Kustomize configs are entirely declarative in nature.

Customers start by creating and refining ISO images of the node configuration they want. A unique image for each node is created based on the configuration provided. The images are then used to repeatedly provision vast numbers of nodes efficiently and quickly, allowing the customer to keep up with the needs from the field for far edge nodes.

Service providers are deploying a more distributed mobile network architecture allowed by the modular functional framework defined for 5G and moving from appliance-based radio access networks (RAN) to open cloud RAN architecture to gain flexibility and agility in delivering services to their customers.
