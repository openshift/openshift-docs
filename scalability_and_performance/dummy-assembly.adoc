= Creating a performance profile
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc


You can use the PPC to create a performance profile.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, disabling CPU load balancing is not supported by cgroup v2. As a result,
you might not get the desired behavior from performance profiles if you have cgroup v2 enabled. Enabling cgroup v2 is not recommended if you are using performace profiles.
