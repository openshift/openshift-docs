toc::[]

In environments with limited bandwidth where you use the {ztp-first} solution to deploy a large number of clusters, you want to avoid downloading all the images that are required for bootstrapping and installing {product-title}.
The limited bandwidth at remote {sno} sites can cause long deployment times.
The {factory-prestaging-tool} allows you to pre-stage servers before shipping them to the remote site for ZTP provisioning.

The {factory-prestaging-tool} does the following:

* Downloads the RHCOS rootfs image that is required by the minimal ISO to boot.
* Creates a partition from the installation disk labelled as `data`.
* Formats the disk in xfs.
* Creates a GUID Partition Table (GPT) data partition at the end of the disk, where the size of the partition is configurable by the tool.
* Copies the container images required to install {product-title}.
* Copies the container images required by ZTP to install {product-title}.
* Optional: Copies Day-2 Operators to the partition.
