toc::[]

By default, Argo Rollouts supports the cluster-scoped mode of installation for Argo Rollouts custom resources (CRs). This mode of installation uses the `CLUSTER_SCOPED_ARGO_ROLLOUTS_NAMESPACES` environment variable to specify a list of namespaces that can be used to manage the rollout resources.

To manage Argo Rollouts resources, after you install the {gitops-title} Operator on the cluster, you can create and configure a `RolloutManager` custom resource (CR) instance in the namespace of your choice. You can then update the existing `Subscription` object for the {gitops-title} Operator and add user-defined namespaces to the `CLUSTER_SCOPED_ARGO_ROLLOUTS_NAMESPACES` environment variable in the `spec` section of the Argo CD instance.
