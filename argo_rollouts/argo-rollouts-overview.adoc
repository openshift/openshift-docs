In the {gitops-shortname} context, progressive delivery is a process of releasing application updates in a controlled and gradual manner. Progressive delivery reduces the risk of a release by exposing the new version of an application update only to a subset of users initially. The process involves continuously observing and analyzing this new application version to verify whether its behavior matches the requirements and expectations set. The verifications continue as the process gradually exposes the application update to a broader and wider audience.

{OCP} provides some progressive delivery capability by using routes to split traffic between different services, but this typically requires manual intervention and management. 

With Argo Rollouts, as a cluster administrator, you can automate the progressive deployment delivery and manage the progressive deployment of applications hosted on Kubernetes and OpenShift Container Platform clusters. Argo Rollouts is a controller with custom resource definitions (CRDs) that provides advanced deployment capabilities such as blue-green, canary, canary analysis, and experimentation.
