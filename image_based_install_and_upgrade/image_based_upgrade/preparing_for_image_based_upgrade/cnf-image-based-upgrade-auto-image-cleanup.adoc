= Configuring the automatic image cleanup of the container storage disk
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: auto-cleanup

toc::[]

Configure when the {lcao} cleans up unpinned images in the `Prep` stage by setting a minimum threshold for available storage space through annotations.
The default container storage disk usage threshold is 50%.

The {lcao} does not delete images that are pinned in CRI-O or are currently used.
The Operator selects the images for deletion by starting with dangling images and then sorting the images from oldest to newest that is determined by the image `Created` timestamp.
