A gateway is a standalone Envoy proxy deployment and an associated Kubernetes service operating at the edge of a service mesh. You can configure a gateway to give fine-grained control over the traffic that enters or leaves the mesh. In {SMProductName}, you can install gateways by using gateway injection or via the Gateway API.

{SMProductName} supports different gateway configurations based on the deployment mode. You can deploy gateways by using gateway injection and configure them with {istio} Gateway and `VirtualService` resources in sidecar mode or with {k8s} Gateway API resources in both sidecar and ambient modes.
