toc::[] 

Using {istio} APIs, you can configure gateway proxies that were installed using gateway injection to accept traffic originating from outside the mesh, and route that traffic to the services within the mesh.

You can expose gateway proxies to traffic outside a cluster by using either a `LoadBalancer` type `Service` or {ocp-short-name} `Routes`.
