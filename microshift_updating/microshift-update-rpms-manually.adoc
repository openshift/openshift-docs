toc::[]

Updating {product-title-first} for non-OSTree systems such as {op-system-base-full} requires downloading then updating the RPMs. For patch releases, such as 4.14.1 to 4.14.2, download and update the RPMs. For minor-version release updates, add the step of enabling the update repository using your subscription manager.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} updates are supported from one minor version to the next in sequence. For example, you must update 4.14 to 4.15.
====

For either upgrading with patch updates or a minor-version update, you can back up application data as needed and move the data copy to a secure location.
