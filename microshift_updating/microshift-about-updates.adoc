== Understanding {microshift-short} updates
{product-title} updates are supported on both `rpm-ostree` edge-deployed hosts and non-OSTree hosts. You can complete updates using the following methods:

* Embed the latest version of {microshift-short} in a new `rpm-ostree` system image such as {op-system-ostree-first}. See xref:../microshift_updating/microshift-update-rpms-ostree.adoc#microshift-update-rpms-ostree[Applying updates on an OSTree system]
* Manually update the RPMs on a non-OSTree system such as {op-system-base-full}. See xref:../microshift_updating/microshift-update-rpms-manually.adoc#microshift-update-rpms-manually[Applying updates manually with RPMs]

[NOTE]
====
Only `rpm-ostree` updates include automatic rollbacks.

=== RPM OSTree updates
Using the {op-system-ostree} `rpm-ostree` update path allows for automated backup and system rollback in case any part of the update fails. You must build a new `rpm-ostree` image and embed the new {microshift-short} version in that image. The `rpm-ostree` image can be the same version or an updated version, but the versions of {op-system-ostree} and {microshift-short} must be compatible.

Check following compatibility table for details:

=== Manual RPM updates
You can use the manual RPM update path to replace your existing version of {microshift-short}. The versions of {op-system} and {microshift-short} must be compatible. Ensuring system health and completing additional system backups are manual processes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that your version of {op-system-base} is compatible with the version of {microshift-short} you are updating to, especially if you are updating {microshift-short} across two minor versions.
