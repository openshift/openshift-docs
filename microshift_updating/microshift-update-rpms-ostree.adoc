toc::[]

Updating {product-title} on an `rpm-ostree` system such as {op-system-ostree-first} requires building a new operating system image containing the new version of {product-title}. After you have the `rpm-ostree` image with {product-title} embedded, direct your system to boot into that operating system image.

The procedures are the same for patches and minor-version updates. For example, use the same steps to upgrade from 4.14.0 to 4.14.1 or from 4.14 to 4.15.
