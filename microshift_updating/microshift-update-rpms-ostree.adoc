toc::[]

Updating {microshift-short} on an `rpm-ostree` system such as {op-system-ostree-first} requires building a new {op-system-ostree} image containing the new version of {microshift-short} and any associated optional RPMs. After you have the `rpm-ostree` image with {microshift-short} embedded, direct your system to boot into that operating system image.

The procedures are the same for minor-version and patch updates. For example, use the same steps to upgrade from 4.14 to 4.16 or from 4.16.0 to 4.16.1.
