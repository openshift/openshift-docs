toc::[]

Storage version migration is used to update existing objects in the {microshift-short} node from their current version to the latest version. The Kube Storage Version Migrator embedded controller is used in {microshift-short} to migrate resources without having to re-create those resources. Either you or a controller can create a `StorageVersionMigration` custom resource (CR) that requests a migration through the Migrator Controller.
