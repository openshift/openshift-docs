toc::[]

Updates are supported on {product-title} beginning with the General Availability version 4.14.

[id="red-hat-device-edge-updates_{context}"]
== {op-system-bundle} updates
You can update {op-system-ostree-first} images or {op-system-base-full} with or without updating the {product-title} version if the version combination is supported. See the following table for details:

include::snippets/microshift-rhde-compatibility-table-snip.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

[id="microshift-update-options-standalone-updates_{context}"]
== Standalone {microshift-short} updates
Consider the following when planning to update {microshift-short}:

* You can potentially update {microshift-short} without reinstalling your applications and Operators.
* {op-system-base} or {op-system-ostree} updates are only required to update {microshift-short} if the existing operating system is not compatible with the new version of {microshift-short} that you want to use.
* {microshift-short} operates as an in-place update and does not require removal of the previous version. Data backups beyond those required for the usual functioning of your applications are also not required.

[NOTE]
====
Only `rpm-ostree` updates include automatic rollbacks.
====

[id="microshift-update-options-rpm-ostree-updates_{context}"]
=== RPM-OSTree updates
Using the {op-system-ostree} `rpm-ostree` update path allows for automated backup and system rollback in case any part of the update fails.

* You can update {microshift-short} on an `rpm-ostree` system such as {op-system-ostree} by building a new system image containing the new version of {microshift-short}.
* The `rpm-ostree` image can be the same version or an updated version, but the versions of {op-system-ostree} and {microshift-short} must be compatible.

The following features are available in the {op-system-ostree} update path:

* The system automatically rolls back to a previous healthy system state if the update fails.
* Applications do not need to be reinstalled.
* Operators do not need to be reinstalled.
* You can update an application without updating {microshift-short} using this update type.
* The image you build can contain other updates as needed.

To begin a {microshift-short} update by embedding in a {op-system-ostree} image, use the procedures in the following documentation:

* xref:../microshift_updating/microshift-update-rpms-ostree.adoc#microshift-update-rpms-ostree[Applying updates on an OSTree system]

To understand more about Greenboot, see the following documentation:

[id="microshift-update-options-manual-rpm-updates_{context}"]
=== Manual RPM updates
You can update {microshift-short} manually on a non-OSTree system such as {op-system-base-full} by updating the RPMs.

* To complete this update type, use the subscription manager to enable the repository that contains the new RPMs.
* Use manual processes to ensure system health and complete additional system backups.
* To begin a manual RPM update, use the procedures in the following documentation:

* xref:../microshift_updating/microshift-update-rpms-manually.adoc#microshift-update-rpms-manually[About updating MicroShift RPMs manually]

[WARNING]
====
Keeping versions in a supported configuration of {op-system-bundle} can require updating {microshift-short} and {op-system-base} at the same time. Ensure that your version of {op-system-base} is compatible with the version of {microshift-short} you are updating to, especially if you are updating {microshift-short} across two minor versions. Otherwise, you can create an unsupported configuration, break your cluster, or both.
====

[id="microshift-update-options-standalone-rhel-updates_{context}"]
== Standalone {op-system-ostree} updates
You can update {op-system-ostree} or {op-system-base} without updating {microshift-short}, on the condition that the two versions are compatible. Check compatibilities before beginning an update. Use the {op-system-ostree} documentation specific to your update path.

[id="microshift-update-options-simultaneous-microshift-rhel-updates_{context}"]
== Simultaneous {microshift-short} and operating system updates
You can update {op-system-ostree} or {op-system-base} and update {microshift-short} at the same time, on the condition that the versions are compatible. Use the following workflow:

. Check for compatibility before beginning an update.
. Use the {op-system-ostree} and {op-system-base} documentation specific to your update path to plan and update the operating system.
. Enable the correct {microshift-short} repository to ensure alignment between your {op-system-base} and {microshift-short} versions.
. Use the {microshift-short} update type specific to your update path.
