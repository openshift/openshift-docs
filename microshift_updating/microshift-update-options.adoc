toc::[]

You can update {op-system-ostree-first} or {op-system-base-full} with or without updating {product-title-first} as long as the two versions are compatible. See the following table for details:

include::snippets/microshift-rhde-compatibility-table-snip.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

*{product-title} update paths*

* Generally Available Version 4.14.0 to 4.14.z on {op-system-ostree} 9.2
* Generally Available Version 4.14.0 to 4.14.z on {op-system} 9.2

[IMPORTANT]
====
Updates of {product-title} from one minor version to the next must be in sequence. For example, you cannot update from 4.14 to 4.16. You must update 4.14 to 4.15.

== Standalone {product-title} updates

You can update {product-title} without reinstalling the applications you created. {op-system} or {op-system-ostree} updates are also not required to update {product-title}, as long as the existing operating system is compatible with the new version of {product-title} that you want to use.

{product-title} operates as an in-place update and does not require removal of the previous version. Data backups beyond those required for the usual functioning of your applications are also not required.

[id="microshift-update-options-rpm-ostree-updates_{context}"]
=== RPM-OSTree updates
You can update {product-title} on an `rpm-ostree` system such as {op-system-ostree} by building a new image containing the new version of {product-title}. Ensure that the version of the operating system you want to use is compatible with the new version of {product-title} that you update to.

The following features are available in the {op-system-ostree} update path:

* The system automatically rolls back to a previous healthy system state if the update fails.
* Applications do not need to be reinstalled.
* You can update an application without updating {product-title} using this update type.
* The image you build can contain other updates as needed.

To begin a {product-title} update by embedding in a {op-system-ostree} image, use the procedures in the following documentation:

* xref:../microshift_updating/microshift-update-rpms-ostree.adoc#microshift-update-rpms-ostree[Applying updates on an OSTree system]

To understand more about Greenboot, see the following documentation:

[id="microshift-update-options-manual-rpm-updates_{context}"]
=== Manual RPM updates
You can update {product-title} manually on a non-OSTree system such as {op-system-base-full} by downloading and updating the RPMs. To complete this update type, use the subscription manager to access the repository containing the new RPMs. To begin a manual RPM update, use the procedures in the following documentation:

* xref:../microshift_updating/microshift-update-rpms-manually.adoc#microshift-update-rpms-manually[About updating MicroShift RPMs manually]

[id="microshift-update-options-standalone-rhel-updates_{context}"]
== Standalone {op-system-ostree} updates
You can update {op-system-ostree} or {op-system} without updating {product-title}, on the condition that the two versions are compatible. Check compatibilities before beginning an update. Use the {op-system-ostree} documentation specific to your update path.

[id="microshift-update-options-simultaneous-microshift-rhel-updates_{context}"]
== Simultaneous {product-title} and operating system updates
You can update {op-system-ostree} or {op-system} and update {product-title} at the same time, on the condition that the versions are compatible. Check for compatibility before beginning an update. First use the {op-system-ostree} documentation specific to your update path to plan and update the operating system. Then use the {product-title} update type specific to your update path.
