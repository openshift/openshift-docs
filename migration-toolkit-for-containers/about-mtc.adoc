The {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) enables you to migrate stateful application workloads between {product-title} clusters at the granularity of a namespace

{mtc-short} provides a web console and an API, based on Kubernetes custom resources, to help you control the migration and minimize application downtime.

The {mtc-short} console is installed on the target cluster by default. You can configure the {mtc-full} Operator to install the console on a link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/5064151[remote cluster].

{mtc-short} supports the file system and snapshot data copy methods for migrating data from the source cluster to the target cluster. You can select a method that is suited for your environment and is supported by your storage provider.
