:FeatureName: Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Cluster Federation (KubeFed)
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

{KubeFedProductName} is based on the open source Kubernetes Cluster Federation (KubeFed) project.
It enables coordinated and centrally managed configuration for multiple clusters in a federated {product-title} deployment through a single API interface.

Federating application resources using {KubeFedProductShortName} allows applications deployed on a cluster in a federated deployment to be continuously reconciled with the desired state.

{KubeFedProductName} provides components which are designed as simple building blocks and can be used to address more advanced use cases, such as disaster recovery and applications across multi-geo deployments.
