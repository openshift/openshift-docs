Before KubeFed can manage resources in a {product-title} cluster, you must use the KubeFed `kubefedctl` tool to register clusters for resource federation.

include::modules/kubefed-deregistering-clusters.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Verifying that clusters have been deregistered from resource federation

See the documentation on xref:kubefed-resource-federation.adoc#kubefed-check-cluster-status_kubefed-resource-federation[Checking the status of federated clusters].

Once you have deregistered a cluster it should not be present in the output list when checking the status of federated clusters.
