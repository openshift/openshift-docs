== Overview
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#custom-build[Custom
build] is designed to fill the gap that was created when everybody jumped into
creating Docker images. Still there is a requirement to produce individual
artifacts (packages, jars, wars, installable zips, base images etc.) This is
where Custom build is the perfect match to fill in that gap. Additionally Custom
build allows implementing any extended build process for example, CI/CD flow
that runs unit or integration tests. The limit here is just the imagination of
the custom builder image author.

To fully utilize the power of Custom build one needs to be understand how to
create a builder image that will be capable of building desired objects.

== Custom Builder Image
The builder image upon invocation receives following environment variables with
the information needed to proceed with the build:

.Custom Builder Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*BUILD*`
|This variable specifies the entire serialized link:../rest_api/openshift_v1.html#v1-build[Build] object.

|`*SOURCE_REPOSITORY*`
|This variable specifies the URL to a repository with sources to build.

|`*DOCKER_SOCKET*`
|This variable specifies the path to the Docker socket, if exposing the Docker socket was enabled on BuildConfig.
|===

== Custom Builder Workflow
Although the custom builder image author has a great flexibility in defining the build
process on its own, still they should follow a few required steps necessary to seamlessly
run a build inside of OpenShift. The required steps for a custom builder image are following:

. Read the link:../rest_api/openshift_v1.html#v1-build[Build] definition, which
contains all the necessary information about input parameters for the build.
. Run the build process.
. If your build produces image, push it to the link:../rest_api/openshift_v1.html#v1-build[Build]'s
output location if the output location is defined. Other output locations can be passed with environment
variable for now.
