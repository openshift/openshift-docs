== Overview
By allowing you to define a specific builder image responsible for the entire
build process, {product-title}'s
xref:../dev_guide/builds/build_strategies.adoc#custom-strategy-options[Custom build strategy] was
designed to fill a gap created with the increased popularity of creating container
images. When there is a requirement for a build to still produce individual
artifacts (packages, JARs, WARs, installable ZIPs, and base images, for
example), a _Custom builder image_ utilizing the Custom build strategy is the
perfect match to fill that gap.

A Custom builder image is a plain container image embedded with build process
logic, for example for building RPMs or base container images. The
`openshift/origin-custom-docker-builder` image is available on the
https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/openshift/origin-custom-docker-builder[Docker
Hub] as an example implementation of a Custom builder image.

Additionally, the Custom builder allows implementing any extended build process,
for example a CI/CD flow that runs unit or integration tests. The only limit is
the imagination of the builder image author.

To fully utilize the power of the Custom build strategy, you must understand how
to create a Custom builder image that will be capable of building desired
objects.

[[custom-builder-image]]
== Custom Builder Image

Upon invocation, a custom builder image will receive the following environment
variables with the information needed to proceed with the build:

.Custom Builder Environment Variables
[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===

|Variable Name |Description

|`*BUILD*`
|The entire serialized JSON of the `*Build*`
xref:../rest_api/openshift_v1.adoc#rest-api-openshift-v1[object definition]. If you need to
use a specific API version for serialization, you can set the
`*buildAPIVersion*` parameter in the
xref:../dev_guide/builds/build_strategies.adoc#custom-strategy-options[custom strategy
specification] of the build configuration.

|`*SOURCE_REPOSITORY*`
|The URL of a Git repository with source to be built.

|`*SOURCE_URI*`
|Uses the same value as `*SOURCE_REPOSITORY*`. Either can be used.

|`*SOURCE_CONTEXT_DIR*`
|Specifies the subdirectory of the Git repository to be used when building. Only
present if defined.

|`*SOURCE_REF*`
|The Git reference to be built.

|`*ORIGIN_VERSION*`
|The version of the OpenShift master that created this build object.

|`*OUTPUT_REGISTRY*`
|The Docker registry to push the image to.

|`*OUTPUT_IMAGE*`
|The Docker tag name for the image being built.

|`*PUSH_DOCKERCFG_PATH*`
|The path to the Docker credentials for running a `docker push` operation.

|`*DOCKER_SOCKET*`
|Specifies the path to the Docker socket, if exposing the Docker socket was
enabled in the build configuration (if `*exposeDockerSocket*` was set to
*true*.)

|===

It is recommended that you write your Custom builder image to only read the
information provided by the `*BUILD*` environment variable, which conforms to an
OpenShift API version. You can then parse the required information from the
build definition JSON instead of relying on the other individual environment
variables provided to the builder image. However, the individual environment
variables are provided for convenience if you do not want to parse the build
definition.

[[custom-builder-workflow]]
== Custom Builder Workflow

Although Custom builder image authors have great flexibility in defining the
build process, your builder image must still adhere to the following required
steps necessary for seamlessly running a build inside of OpenShift:

. Read the `*Build*` xref:../rest_api/openshift_v1.adoc#v1-build[object
definition], which contains all the necessary information about input parameters
for the build.
. Run the build process.
. If your build produces an image, push it to the build's
xref:../rest_api/openshift_v1.adoc#rest-api-openshift-v1[output location] if it is
defined. Other output locations can be passed with environment variables.
