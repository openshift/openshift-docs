== Overview
Defining image metadata helps {product-title} better consume your container images,
allowing {product-title} to create a better experience for developers using your
image. For example, you can add metadata to provide helpful descriptions of your
image, or offer suggestions on other images that may also be needed.

This topic only defines the metadata needed by the current set of use cases.
Additional metadata or use cases may be added in the future.

== Defining Image Metadata
You can use the `LABEL` instruction in a *_Dockerfile_* to define image
metadata. Labels are similar to environment variables in that they are key value
pairs attached to an image or a container. Labels are different from environment
variable in that they are not visible to the running application and they can
also be used for fast look-up of images and containers.

link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#label[Docker
documentation] for more information on the `LABEL` instruction.

The label names should typically be namespaced. The namespace should be set
accordingly to reflect the project that is going to pick up the labels and use
them. For {product-title} the namespace should be set to *_io.openshift_* and
for Kubernetes the namespace is *_io.k8s_*.

See the https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/labels-custom-metadata[Docker custom
metadata] documentation for details about the format.

|Variable |Description

|`*io.openshift.tags*`
|This label contains a list of tags represented as list of comma-separated
string values. The tags are the way to categorize the container images into broad
areas of functionality. Tags help UI and generation tools to suggest relevant
container images during the application creation process.

====

----
LABEL io.openshift.tags   mongodb,mongodb24,nosql
----
====

|`*io.openshift.wants*`
|Specifies a list of tags that the generation tools and the UI might use to
provide relevant suggestions if you don't have the container images with given tags
already. For example, if the container image wants `mysql` and `redis` and you
don't have the container image with `redis` tag, then UI might suggest you to add
this image into your deployment.

====

----
LABEL io.openshift.wants   mongodb,redis
----
====

|`*io.k8s.description*`
|This label can be used to give the container image consumers more detailed
information about the service or functionality this image provides. The UI can
then use this description together with the container image name to provide more
human friendly information to end users.

====

----
LABEL io.k8s.description The MySQL 5.5 Server with master-slave replication support
----
====

|`*io.openshift.non-scalable*`
|An image might use this variable to suggest that it does not support scaling.
The UI will then communicate this to consumers of that image. Being not-scalable
basically means that the value of `replicas` should initially not be set higher
than 1.

====

----
LABEL io.openshift.non-scalable     true
----
====

|`*io.openshift.min-memory*` and `*io.openshift.min-cpu*`
|This label suggests how much resources the container image might need in order to
work properly. The UI might warn the user that deploying this container image may
exceed their user quota. The values must be compatible with
Kubernetes quantity.

====

----
LABEL io.openshift.min-memory 8Gi
LABEL io.openshift.min-cpu     4
