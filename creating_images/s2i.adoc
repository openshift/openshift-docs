== Overview
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#source-build[Source-to-Image
(S2I)] is a framework that makes it easy to write images that take application
source code as an input and produce a new image that runs the assembled
application as output.

The main advantage of using S2I for building reproducible container images is the
ease of use for developers. As a builder image author, you must understand two
basic concepts in order for your images to provide the best possible S2I performance:
xref:build-process[the build process] and xref:s2i-scripts[S2I scripts].

[[build-process]]

== Build Process
The build process consists of the following three fundamental elements, which
are combined into a final container image:

- sources
- S2I scripts
- builder image

During the build process, S2I must place sources and scripts inside the builder
image. To do so, S2I creates a *_tar_* file that contains the sources and
scripts, then streams that file into the builder image. Before executing the
*_assemble_* script, S2I untars that file and places its contents into the
location specified by the `*io.openshift.s2i.destination*`
label from the builder image, with the default location being the
*_/tmp_* directory.

For this process to happen, your image must supply the *tar* archiving
utility (the `tar` command available in `*$PATH*`) and the command line
interpreter (the `/bin/sh` command); this allows your image to use the fastest
possible build path. If the `tar` or `/bin/sh` command is not available, the
`s2i build` process is forced to automatically perform an additional container build
to put both the sources and the scripts inside the image, and only then run the
usual build.

See the following diagram for the basic S2I build workflow:

.Build Workflow
image::s2i-flow.png[S2I workflow]

* Run build's responsibility is to untar the sources, scripts and artifacts
  (if such exist) and invoke the `assemble` script.  If this is the second run
  (after catching `tar` or `/bin/sh` not found error) it is responsible only
  for invoking `assemble` script, since both scripts and sources are already there.


[[s2i-scripts]]

== S2I Scripts
You can write S2I scripts in any programming language, as long as the scripts are
executable inside the builder image. S2I supports multiple options providing
`assemble`/`run`/`save-artifacts` scripts. All of these locations are checked on
each build in the following order:


1. A script xref:../dev_guide/builds/build_strategies.adoc#override-builder-image-scripts[specified in the BuildConfig]
2. A script found in the application source `.s2i/bin` directory
3. A script found at the default image URL (`io.openshift.s2i.scripts-url` label)

Both the `io.openshift.s2i.scripts-url` label specified in the image and the
script specified in a BuildConfig can take one of the following forms:

- `image:///path_to_scripts_dir` - absolute path inside the image to a directory where the S2I scripts are located
- `$$file:///path_to_scripts_dir$$` - relative or absolute path to a directory on the host where the S2I scripts are located
- `http(s)://path_to_scripts_dir` - URL to a directory where the S2I scripts are located

|===

|Script |Description

|*_assemble_*
(required)
|The *_assemble_* script builds the application artifacts from a source
and places them into appropriate directories inside the image. The workflow for
this script is:

. Restore build artifacts. If you want to support incremental builds, make sure to define *_save-artifacts_* as well (optional).
. Place the application source in the desired location.
. Build the application artifacts.
. Install the artifacts into locations appropriate for them to run.

|*_run_*
(required)
|The *_run_* script executes your application.

|*_save-artifacts_*
(optional)
|The *_save-artifacts_* script gathers all dependencies that can speed up the
build processes that follow. For example:

- For Ruby, *gems* installed by Bundler.
- For Java, *.m2* contents.

These dependencies are gathered into a tar file and streamed to the standard
output.

|*_usage_*
(optional)
|The *_usage_* script allows you to inform the user how to properly use your
image.

|*_test/run_*
(optional)
|The *_test/run_* script allows you to create a simple process to check if the
image is working correctly. The proposed flow of that process is:

. Build the image.
. Run the image to verify the *_usage_* script.
. Run `s2i build` to verify the *_assemble_* script.
. Run `s2i build` again to verify the *_save-artifacts_* and *_assemble_* scripts save and restore artifacts functionality. (optional)
. Run the image to verify the test application is working.

See the xref:s2i_testing.adoc#creating-images-s2i-testing[Testing S2I Images] topic for more information.

NOTE: The suggested location to put the test application built by your
*_test/run_* script is the *_test/test-app_* directory in your image repository.
See the https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/blob/master/docs/cli.md#sti-create[S2I documentation]
for more information.

*Example S2I Scripts*

NOTE: The following examples are written in Bash and it is assumed all tar
contents are unpacked into the *_/tmp/s2i_* directory.

.*_assemble_* script:
====

----
#!/bin/bash

# restore build artifacts
if [ "$(ls /tmp/s2i/artifacts/ 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
    mv /tmp/s2i/artifacts/* $HOME/.
fi

# move the application source
mv /tmp/s2i/src $HOME/src

# build application artifacts
pushd ${HOME}
make all

# install the artifacts
make install
popd
----
====

.*_run_* script:
====

----
#!/bin/bash

# run the application
/opt/application/run.sh
----
====

.*_save-artifacts_* script:
====

----
#!/bin/bash

pushd ${HOME}
if [ -d deps ]; then
    # all deps contents to tar stream
    tar cf - deps
fi
popd

----
====

.*_usage_* script:
====

----
#!/bin/bash

# inform the user how to use the image
cat <<EOF
This is a S2I sample builder image, to use it, install
https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image

[[using-images-with-onbuild-instructions]]

== Using Images with ONBUILD Instructions
The `ONBUILD` instructions can be found in many official Docker images. For
example:

- Ruby
- Node.js
- Python

See the link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#onbuild[Docker
documentation] for more information on `ONBUILD`.

Upon startup, S2I detects whether the builder image contains `sh` and `tar` binaries
which are necessary for the S2I process to inject build inputs.  If the builder image
does not contain these prerequisites, it will attempt to instead perform a container build
to layer the inputs.  If the builder image includes `ONBUILD` instructions, S2I
will instead fail the build because the `ONBUILD` instructions would be executed
during the layering process, and that equates to performing a generic container
build which is less secure than an S2I build and requires explicit permissions.

Therefore you should ensure that your S2I builder image either does not contain
`ONBUILD` instructions, or ensure that it has the necessary `sh` and `tar` binary
prerequisites.
