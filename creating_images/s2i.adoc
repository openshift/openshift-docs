== Overview
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[Source-to-Image
(S2I)] is a framework that makes it easy to write images that take application
source code as an input and produce a new image that runs the assembled
application as output.

The main advantage of using S2I for building reproducible Docker images is the
ease of use for developers. As a builder image author, you must understand two
basic concepts in order for your images to provide the best possible S2I performance:
link:#build-process[the build process] and link:#s2i-scripts[S2I scripts].

[[build-process]]

== Build Process
The build process consists of the following three fundamental elements, which
are combined into a final Docker image:

- sources
- S2I scripts
- builder image

During the build process, S2I must place sources and scripts inside the builder
image. To do so, S2I creates a *_tar_* file that contains the sources and
scripts, then streams that file into the builder image. Before executing the
*_assemble_* script, S2I untars that file and places its contents into the
location specified with the `--destination` flag or the `*io.openshift.s2i.destination*`
label from the builder image, with the default location being the
*_/tmp_* directory.

For this process to happen, your image must supply the *tar* archiving
utility (the `tar` command available in `*$PATH*`) and the command line
interpreter (the `/bin/sh` command); this allows your image to use the fastest
possible build path. If the `tar` or `/bin/sh` command is not available, the
`s2i build` process is forced to automatically perform an additional Docker build
to put both the sources and the scripts inside the image, and only then run the
usual `s2i build` procedure.

See the following diagram for the basic S2I build workflow:

.Build Workflow
image::s2i-flow.png[S2I workflow]

* Run build's responsibility is to untar the sources, scripts and artifacts (if such exist) and invoke the `assemble` script. If this is the second run (after catching `tar`/`/bin/sh` not found error) it is responsible only for invoking `assemble` script, since both scripts and sources are already there.


[[s2i-scripts]]

== S2I Scripts
You can write S2I scripts in any programming language, as long as the scripts are
executable inside the builder image. S2I supports multiple options providing
`assemble`/`run`/`save-artifacts` scripts. All of these locations are checked on
each build in the following order:

1. A script found at the `--scripts-url` URL
2. A script found in the application source `.sti/bin` directory
3. A script found at the default image URL (`io.openshift.s2i.scripts-url` label)

Both the `io.openshift.s2i.scripts-url` label specified in the image and the `--scripts-url` flag
can take one of the following form:

- `image://path_to_scripts_dir` - absolute path inside the image to a directory where the S2I scripts are located
- `$$file://path_to_scripts_dir$$` - relative or absolute path to a directory on the host where the S2I scripts are located
- `http(s)://path_to_scripts_dir` - URL to a directory where the S2I scripts are located

NOTE: In case where the scripts are already placed inside the image (using `--scripts-url`
or `io.openshift.s2i.scripts-url` with value `image:///path/in/image`) then setting `--destination`
or `io.openshift.s2i.destination` label applies only to sources and artifacts.

.S2I Scripts
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Script |Description

|*_assemble_*
(required)
|The *_assemble_* script builds the application artifacts from a source
and places them into appropriate directories inside the image. The workflow for
this script is:

. Restore build artifacts. If you want to support incremental builds, make sure to define *_save-artifacts_* as well (optional).
. Place the application source in the desired location.
. Build the application artifacts.
. Install the artifacts into locations appropriate for them to run.

|*_run_*
(required)
|The *_run_* script executes your application.

|*_save-artifacts_*
(optional)
|The *_save-artifacts_* script gathers all dependencies that can speed up the
build processes that follow. For example:

- For Ruby, *gems* installed by Bundler.
- For Java, *.m2* contents.

These dependencies are gathered into a tar file and streamed to the standard
output.

|*_usage_*
(optional)
|The *_usage_* script allows you to inform the user how to properly use your
image.

|*_test/run_*
(optional)
|The *_test/run_* script allows you to create a simple process to check if the
image is working correctly. The proposed flow of that process is:

. Build the image.
. Run the image to verify the *_usage_* script.
. Run `s2i build` to verify the *_assemble_* script.
. Run `s2i build` again to verify the *_save-artifacts_* and *_assemble_* scripts save and restore artifacts functionality. (optional)
. Run the image to verify the test application is working.

See the link:s2i_testing.html[Testing S2I Images] topic for more information.

NOTE: The suggested location to put the test application built by your
*_test/run_* script is the *_test/test-app_* directory in your image repository.
See the https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/blob/master/docs/cli.md#sti-create[S2I documentation]
for more information.

*Example S2I Scripts*

NOTE: The following examples are written in Bash and it is assumed all tar
contents are unpacked into the *_/tmp/s2i_* directory.

.*_assemble_* script:
====

----
#!/bin/bash

# restore build artifacts
if [ "$(ls /tmp/s2i/artifacts/ 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
    mv /tmp/s2i/artifacts/* $HOME/.
fi

# move the application source
mv /tmp/s2i/src $HOME/src

# build application artifacts
pushd ${HOME}
make all

# install the artifacts
make install
popd
----
====

.*_run_* script:
====

----
#!/bin/bash

# run the application
/opt/application/run.sh
----
====

.*_save-artifacts_* script:
====

----
#!/bin/bash

pushd ${HOME}
if [ -d deps ]; then
    # all deps contents to tar stream
    tar cf - deps
fi
popd

----
====

.*_usage_* script:
====

----
#!/bin/bash

# inform the user how to use the image
cat <<EOF
This is a S2I sample builder image, to use it, install
https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image

[[using-images-with-onbuild-instructions]]

== Using Images with `ONBUILD` Instructions
The `ONBUILD` instructions can be found in many official Docker images. For
example:

- https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/library/ruby[Ruby]
- https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/library/node[Node.js]
- https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/library/python[Python]

See the https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/#onbuild[Docker documentation]
for more information on `ONBUILD`.

Upon start S2I detects whether the builder image uses `ONBUILD` instructions.
If there are none, the regular S2I link:#build-process[build] is performed,
otherwise a different strategy is chosen. During such a S2I build,
all `ONBUILD` instructions are executed in the order they were defined in the
builder image's Dockerfile. The S2I scripts are not required for this strategy,
but they can be used as a supplement to existing `ONBUILD` instructions.

Many official Docker images that use `ONBUILD` do not declare the image `CMD` or
`ENTRYPOINT`, and for that, S2I must know how to run your application. There are
two methods for defining the `ENTRYPOINT`:

- Include the *_run_* script in your application root folder. S2I recognizes it
and sets it as the application image `ENTRYPOINT`.

- Use the link:#s2i-scripts[S2I scripts]. If you provide them, the *_run_* script
is set as an image `ENTRYPOINT`. If the S2I scripts location also includes the
*_assemble_* script, that script is executed as the last instruction of the underlying
Docker build.
