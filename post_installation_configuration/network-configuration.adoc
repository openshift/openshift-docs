== Configuring ingress cluster traffic

// This section is sourced from networking/configuring_ingress_cluster_traffic/overview-traffic.adoc

{product-title} provides the following methods for communicating from outside the cluster with services running in the cluster:

* If you have HTTP/HTTPS, use an Ingress Controller.
* If you have a TLS-encrypted protocol other than HTTPS, such as TLS with the SNI header, use an Ingress Controller.
* Otherwise, use a load balancer, an external IP, or a node port.

[id="post-install-configuring-node-port-service-range"]
== Configuring the node port service range

As a cluster administrator, you can expand the available node port range. If your cluster uses of a large number of node ports, you might need to increase the number of available ports.

The default port range is `30000-32767`. You can never reduce the port range, even if you first expand it beyond the default range.

[id="post-install-configuring-node-port-service-range-prerequisites"]
=== Prerequisites

- Your cluster infrastructure must allow access to the ports that you specify within the expanded range. For example, if you expand the node port range to `30000-32900`, the inclusive port range of `32768-32900` must be allowed by your firewall or packet filtering configuration.

automatically include `NetworkPolicy` objects when you create a new project.
