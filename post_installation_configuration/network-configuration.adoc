== Configuring ingress cluster traffic

// This section is sourced from networking/configuring_ingress_cluster_traffic/overview-traffic.adoc

{product-title} provides the following methods for communicating from
outside the cluster with services running in the cluster:

* If you have HTTP/HTTPS, use an Ingress Controller.
* If you have a TLS-encrypted protocol other than HTTPS, such as TLS with the SNI
header, use an Ingress Controller.
* Otherwise, use a Load Balancer, an External IP, or a `NodePort`.
