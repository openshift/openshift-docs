In {product-title}, an alert is fired when the conditions defined in an alerting rule are true. An alert provides a notification that a set of circumstances are apparent within a cluster. Firing alerts can be viewed in the Alerting UI in the {product-title} web console by default. After an installation, you can configure {product-title} to send alert notifications to external systems.
