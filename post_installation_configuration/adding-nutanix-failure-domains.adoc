toc::[]

By default, the installation program installs control plane and compute machines into a single Nutanix Prism Element (cluster). After an {product-title} cluster is deployed, you can improve its fault tolerance by adding additional Prism Element instances to the deployment using failure domains.

A failure domain represents a single Prism Element instance to which:

* New control plane and compute machines can be deployed.
* Existing control plane and compute machines can be distributed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you deployed the {product-title} cluster using the {ai-full}, be sure that the postinstallation steps have been completed. Completing the {product-title} integration with Nutanix is required to add failure domains. For more information, see the {ai-full} documentation for link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform/2024/html/installing_openshift_container_platform_with_the_assisted_installer/assembly_installing-on-nutanix#nutanix-post-installation-configuration_assembly_installing-on-nutanix[Nutanix postinstallation configuration].
