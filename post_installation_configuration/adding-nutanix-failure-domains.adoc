toc::[]

By default, the installation program installs control plane and compute machines into a single Nutanix Prism Element (cluster). After an {product-title} cluster is deployed, you can improve its fault tolerance by adding additional Prism Element instances to the deployment using failure domains.

A failure domain represents a single Prism Element instance to which:

* New control plane and compute machines can be deployed.
* Existing control plane and compute machines can be distributed.
