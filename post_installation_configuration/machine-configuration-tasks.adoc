There are times when you need to make changes to the operating systems running on {product-title} nodes. This can include changing settings for network time service, adding kernel arguments, or configuring journaling in a specific way.

Aside from a few specialized features, most changes to operating systems on {product-title} nodes can be done by creating what are referred to as `MachineConfig` objects that are managed by the Machine Config Operator.

Tasks in this section describe how to use features of the Machine Config Operator to configure operating system features on {product-title} nodes.

== Using MachineConfig objects to configure nodes

You can use the tasks in this section to create `MachineConfig` objects that modify files, systemd unit files, and other operating system features running on {product-title} nodes. For more ideas on working with machine configs, see content related to link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3868301[updating] SSH authorized keys, link:https://access.redhat.com/verify-images-ocp4[verifying image signatures], link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4727321[enabling SCTP], and link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5170251[configuring iSCSI initiatornames] for {product-title}.

{product-title} supports link:https://coreos.github.io/ignition/configuration-v3_2/[Ignition specification version 3.2]. All new machine configs you create going forward should be based on Ignition specification version 3.2. If you are upgrading your {product-title} cluster, any existing Ignition specification version 2.x machine configs will be translated automatically to specification version 3.2.

There might be situations where the configuration on a node does not fully match what the currently-applied machine config specifies. This state is called _configuration drift_. The Machine Config Daemon (MCD) regularly checks the nodes for configuration drift. If the MCD detects configuration drift, the MCO marks the node `degraded` until an administrator corrects the node configuration. A degraded node is online and operational, but, it cannot be updated. For more information on configuration drift, see xref:../post_installation_configuration/machine-configuration-tasks.adoc#machine-config-drift-detection_post-install-machine-configuration-tasks[Understanding configuration drift detection].

[TIP]
====
Use the following "Configuring chrony time service" procedure as a model for how to go about adding other configuration files to {product-title} nodes.

== Configuring MCO-related custom resources

Besides managing `MachineConfig` objects, the MCO manages two custom resources (CRs): `KubeletConfig` and `ContainerRuntimeConfig`. Those CRs let you change node-level settings impacting how the Kubelet and CRI-O container runtime services behave.
