There are times when you need to make changes to the operating systems running on {product-title} nodes. This can include changing settings for network time service, adding kernel arguments, or configuring journaling in a specific way.

Aside from a few specialized features, most changes to operating systems on {product-title} nodes can be done by creating what are referred to as `MachineConfig` objects that are managed by the Machine Config Operator.

Tasks in this section describe how to use features of the Machine Config Operator to configure operating system features on {product-title} nodes.

== Using machine config objects to configure nodes

The following sections show you how to create and use `MachineConfig` objects to modify files, `systemd` unit files, and other operating system features running on {product-title} nodes. For other examples, see the following Red Hat Knowledgebase articles:

{product-title} version 4.7 supports link:https://coreos.github.io/ignition/configuration-v3_2/[Ignition specification version 3.2]. When you create a new machine config, use specification version 3.2. If you upgraded your {product-title} cluster from an earlier version, existing Ignition specification version 2.x machine configs were translated automatically to specification version 3.2.

Use the "Configuring crony time service" section as a model for how to go about adding other configuration files to {product-title} nodes.

[id="configuring-machines-with-custom-resources"]
== Configuring MCO-related custom resources

Besides managing `MachineConfig` objects, the MCO manages two custom resources (CRs): `KubeletConfig` and `ContainerRuntimeConfig`. Those CRs let you change node-level settings impacting how the Kubelet and CRI-O container runtime services behave.
