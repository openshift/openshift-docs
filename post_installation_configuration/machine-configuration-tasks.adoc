There are times when you need to make changes to the
operating systems running on {product-title} nodes. This can include
changing settings for network time service, adding kernel arguments,
or configuring journaling in a specific way.

Aside from a few specialized features, most changes to
operating systems on {product-title} nodes can be done by creating
what are referred to as MachineConfig objects that are managed by the
Machine Config Operator.

Tasks in this section describe how to use features of
the Machine Config Operator to configure operating system
features on {product-title} nodes.

== Using MachineConfigs to configure nodes
Tasks in this section let you create MachineConfig objects to modify files, systemd unit files, and other operating system features running on {product-title} nodes. For more ideas on working with MachineConfigs, see

MachineConfigs 

{product-title} version 4.6 supports
link:https://github.com/coreos/ignition/blob/master/docs/configuration-v3_1.md[Ignition specification version 3.1]. 
All new MachineConfigs you create going forward should be based on
Ignition specification version 3.1.  If you are upgrading your {product-title} cluster,
any existing Ignition specification version 2.x MachineConfigs will be translated automatically to
specification version 3.1.

Use the "Configuring crony time service" section as a model for how to go about adding
other configuration files to {product-title} nodes.

[id="configuring-machines-with-custom-resources"]
== Configuring MCO-related custom resources
Besides managing MachineConfigs, the MCO manages two custom resources (CRs): KubeletConfig and ContainerRuntimeConfig.
Those CRs let you change node-level settings impacting how
the Kubelet and CRI-O container runtime services behave.
