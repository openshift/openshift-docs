== Postinstallation configuration tasks

You can perform the postinstallation configuration tasks to configure your environment to meet your needs.

The following lists details these configurations:

* xref:../machine_configuration/index.adoc#machine-config-overview[Configure operating system features]: The Machine Config Operator (MCO) manages `MachineConfig` objects. By using the MCO, you can configure nodes and custom resources.

* xref:../post_installation_configuration/post-install-bare-metal-configuration.adoc#post-install-bare-metal-configuration[Configure bare metal nodes]: You can use the Bare Metal Operator (BMO) to manage bare metal hosts. The BMO can complete the following operations:

** Inspects hardware details of the host and report them to the bare metal host.
** Inspect firmware and configure BIOS settings.
** Provision hosts with a desired image.
** Clean disk contents for the host before or after provisioning the host.

* xref:../post_installation_configuration/cluster-tasks.adoc#post-install-cluster-tasks[Configure cluster features]. You can modify the following features of an {product-title} cluster:

** Image registry
** Networking configuration
** Image build behavior
** Identity provider
** The etcd configuration
** Machine set creation to handle the workloads
** Cloud provider credential management

* xref:../post_installation_configuration/configuring-private-cluster.adoc#configuring-private-cluster[Configuring a private cluster]: By default, the installation program provisions {product-title} by using a publicly accessible DNS and endpoints. To make your cluster accessible only from within an internal network, configure the following components to make them private:

** DNS
** Ingress Controller
** API server

* xref:../post_installation_configuration/node-tasks.adoc#post-install-node-tasks[Perform node operations]: By default, {product-title} uses {op-system-first} compute machines. You can perform the following node operations:

** Add and remove compute machines.
** Add and remove taints and tolerations.
** Configure the maximum number of pods per node.
** Enable Device Manager.

* xref:../post_installation_configuration/preparing-for-users.adoc#post-install-preparing-for-users[Configure users]: Users can authenticate themselves to the API by using OAuth access tokens. You can configure OAuth to perform the following tasks:

** Specify an identity provider.
** Use role-based access control to define and grant permissions to users.
** Install an Operator from OperatorHub.

* xref:../post_installation_configuration/configuring-alert-notifications.adoc#configuring-alert-notifications[Configuring alert notifications]: By default, firing alerts are displayed on the Alerting UI of the web console. You can also configure {product-title} to send alert notifications to external systems.
