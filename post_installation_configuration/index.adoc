== Post-installation configuration tasks

You can perform the post-installation configuration tasks to configure your environment to meet your need.

The following lists details these configurations:

* xref:../post_installation_configuration/machine-configuration-tasks.adoc#post-install-machine-configuration-tasks[Configure operating system features]: The Machine Config Operator (MCO) manages `MachineConfig` objects. By using the MCO, you can configure nodes and custom resources.

* xref:../post_installation_configuration/bare-metal-configuration.adoc#post-install-bare-metal-configuration[Configure bare metal nodes]: You can use the Bare Metal Operator (BMO) to manage bare metal hosts. The BMO can complete the following operations:

** Inspects hardware details of the host and report them to the bare metal host.
** Inspect firmware and configure BIOS settings.
** Provision hosts with a desired image.
** Clean disk contents for the host before or after provisioning the host.

* xref:../post_installation_configuration/cluster-tasks.adoc#post-install-cluster-tasks[Configure cluster features]. You can modify the following features of an {product-title} cluster:

** Image registry
** Networking configuration
** Image build behavior
** Identity provider
** The etcd configuration
** Machine set creation to handle the workloads
** Cloud provider credential management

* xref:../post_installation_configuration/configuring-private-cluster.adoc#configuring-private-cluster[Configuring a private cluster]: By default, the installation program provisions {product-title} by using a publicly accessible DNS and endpoints. To make your cluster accessible only from within an internal network, configure the following components to make them private:

** DNS
** Ingress Controller
** API server

* xref:../post_installation_configuration/node-tasks.adoc#post-install-node-tasks[Perform node operations]: By default, {product-title} uses {op-system-first} compute machines. You can perform the following node operations:

** Add and remove compute machines.
** Add and remove taints and tolerations.
** Configure the maximum number of pods per node.
** Enable Device Manager.

* xref:../post_installation_configuration/network-configuration.adoc#post-install-network-configuration[Configure network]: After installing {product-title}, you can configure the following components:

** Ingress cluster traffic
** Node port service range
** Network policy
** Enabling the cluster-wide proxy

* xref:../post_installation_configuration/storage-configuration.adoc#post-install-storage-configuration[Configure storage]:
By default, containers operate by using the ephemeral storage or transient local storage. The ephemeral storage has a lifetime limitation. To store the data for a long time, you must configure persistent storage. You can configure storage by using one of the following methods:

** *Dynamic provisioning*: You can dynamically provision storage on demand by defining and creating storage classes that control different levels of storage, including storage access.

** *Static provisioning*: You can use Kubernetes persistent volumes to make existing storage available to a cluster. Static provisioning can support various device configurations and mount options.

* xref:../post_installation_configuration/preparing-for-users.adoc#post-install-preparing-for-users[Configure users]: OAuth access tokens allow users to authenticate themselves to the API. You can configure OAuth to perform the following tasks:

* Specify an identity provider
* Use role-based access control to define and supply permissions to users
* Install an Operator from OperatorHub

* xref:../post_installation_configuration/configuring-alert-notifications.adoc#configuring-alert-notifications[Configuring alert notifications]: By default, firing alerts are displayed on the Alerting UI of the web console. You can also configure {product-title} to send alert notifications to external systems.
