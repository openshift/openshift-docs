toc::[]

To create an AWS cluster with multi-architecture compute machines, you must first create a single-architecture AWS installer-provisioned cluster with the multi-architecture installer binary. For more information on AWS installations, refer to xref:../../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-customizations.adoc[Installing a cluster on AWS with customizations]. You can then add a ARM64 compute machine set to your AWS cluster.
