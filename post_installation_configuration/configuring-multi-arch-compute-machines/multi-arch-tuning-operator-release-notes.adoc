The Multiarch Tuning Operator optimizes workload management within multi-architecture clusters and in single-architecture clusters transitioning to multi-architecture environments.

These release notes track the development of the Multiarch Tuning Operator.

[id="multi-arch-tuning-operator-release-notes-1-1-0_{context}"]
== Release notes for the Multiarch Tuning Operator 1.1.0

Issued: 18 March 2024

[id="multi-arch-tuning-operator-1-1-0-new-features-and-enhancements_{context}"]
=== New features and enhancements

* The Multiarch Tuning Operator is now supported on managed offerings, including ROSA with Hosted Control Planes (HCP) and other HCP environments.

* With this release, you can configure architecture-aware workload scheduling by using the new `plugins` field in the `ClusterPodPlacementConfig` object. You can use the `plugins.nodeAffinityScoring` field to set architecture preferences for pod placement. If you enable the `nodeAffinityScoring` plugin, the scheduler first filters out nodes that do not meet the pod requirements. Then, the scheduler prioritizes the remaining nodes based on the architecture scores defined in the `nodeAffinityScoring.platforms` field.

==== Bug fixes

* With this release, the Multiarch Tuning Operator does not update the `nodeAffinity` field for pods that are managed by a daemon set. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-45885[*OCPBUGS-45885*])

== Release notes for the Multiarch Tuning Operator 1.0.0

Issued: 31 October 2024

[id="multi-arch-tuning-operator-1-0-0-new-features-and-enhancements_{context}"]
=== New features and enhancements

* With this release, the Multiarch Tuning Operator supports custom network scenarios and cluster-wide custom registries configurations.
* With this release, you can identify pods based on their architecture compatibility by using the pod labels that the Multiarch Tuning Operator adds to newly created pods.
* With this release, you can monitor the behavior of the Multiarch Tuning Operator by using the metrics and alerts that are registered in the Cluster Monitoring Operator.
