= Creating a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines on {ibm-power-title}

toc::[]

To create a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines on {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), you must have an existing single-architecture (`x86_64`) cluster. You can then add `ppc64le` compute machines to your {product-title} cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you can add `ppc64le` nodes to your cluster, you must upgrade your cluster to one that uses the multi-architecture payload. For more information on migrating to the multi-architecture payload, see xref:../../updating/updating_a_cluster/migrating-to-multi-payload.adoc#migrating-to-multi-payload[Migrating to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines].
====

The following procedures explain how to create a {op-system} compute machine using an ISO image or network PXE booting. This will allow you to add `ppc64le` nodes to your cluster and deploy a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines.

[NOTE]
====
To create an {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`) cluster with multi-architecture compute machines on `x86_64`, follow the instructions for
xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_power/preparing-to-install-on-ibm-power.adoc#preparing-to-install-on-ibm-power[Installing a cluster on {ibm-power-name}]. You can then add `x86_64` compute machines as described in xref:./creating-multi-arch-compute-nodes-bare-metal.adoc#creating-multi-arch-compute-nodes-bare-metal[Creating a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines on bare metal, {ibm-power-title}, or {ibm-z-title}].
