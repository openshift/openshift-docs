= Creating a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines on {gcp-short}

toc::[]

To create a {gcp-first} cluster with multi-architecture compute machines, you must first create a single-architecture {gcp-short} installer-provisioned cluster with the multi-architecture installer binary. For more information on AWS installations, see xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-customizations.adoc[Installing a cluster on {gcp-short} with customizations]. 

You can also migrate your current cluster with single-architecture compute machines to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines. For more information, see xref:../../updating/updating_a_cluster/migrating-to-multi-payload.adoc#migrating-to-multi-payload[Migrating to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines].

After creating a multi-architecture cluster, you can add nodes with different architectures to the cluster.

Secure booting is currently not supported on 64-bit ARM machines for {gcp-short}
