toc::[]

To create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cluster with multi-architecture compute machines, you must first create a single-architecture GCP installer-provisioned cluster with the multi-architecture installer binary. For more information on AWS installations, refer to xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-customizations.adoc[Installing a cluster on GCP with customizations]. You can then add ARM64 compute machines sets to your GCP cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Secure booting is currently not supported on ARM64 machines for GCP
