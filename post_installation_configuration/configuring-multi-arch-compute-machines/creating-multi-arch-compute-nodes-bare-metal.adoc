= Creating a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines on bare metal, {ibm-power-title}, or {ibm-z-title}

toc::[]

To create a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines on bare metal (`x86_64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), or {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) you must have an existing single-architecture cluster on one of these platforms. Follow the installations procedures for your platform:

* xref:../../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.adoc#installing-bare-metal[Installing a user provisioned cluster on bare metal]. You can then add 64-bit ARM compute machines to your {product-title} cluster on bare metal.
* xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_power/preparing-to-install-on-ibm-power.adoc#preparing-to-install-on-ibm-power[Installing a cluster on {ibm-power-name}]. You can then add `x86_64` compute machines to your {product-title} cluster on {ibm-power-name}.
* xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_z/preparing-to-install-on-ibm-z.adoc#preparing-to-install-on-ibm-z[Installing a cluster on {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name}]. You can then add `x86_64` compute machines to your {product-title} cluster on {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name}.

Before you can add additional compute nodes to your cluster, you must upgrade your cluster to one that uses the multi-architecture payload. For more information on migrating to the multi-architecture payload, see xref:../../updating/updating_a_cluster/migrating-to-multi-payload.adoc#migrating-to-multi-payload[Migrating to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines].

The following procedures explain how to create a {op-system} compute machine using an ISO image or network PXE booting. This will allow you to add additional nodes to your cluster and deploy a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines.
