To create a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines on bare metal, you must have an existing single-architecture bare metal cluster. For more information on bare metal installations, see xref:../../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.adoc#installing-bare-metal[Installing a user provisioned cluster on bare metal]. You can then add 64-bit ARM compute machines to your {product-title} cluster on bare metal.

Before you can add 64-bit ARM nodes to your bare metal cluster, you must upgrade your cluster to one that uses the multi-architecture payload. For more information on migrating to the multi-architecture payload, see xref:../../updating/updating_a_cluster/migrating-to-multi-payload.adoc#migrating-to-multi-payload[Migrating to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines].

The following procedures explain how to create a {op-system} compute machine using an ISO image or network PXE booting. This will allow you to add ARM64 nodes to your bare metal cluster and deploy a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines.
