= Managing workloads on multi-architecture clusters by using the Multiarch Tuning Operator
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

The Multiarch Tuning Operator optimizes workload management within multi-architecture clusters and in single-architecture clusters transitioning to multi-architecture environments.

Architecture-aware workload scheduling allows the scheduler to place pods onto nodes that match the architecture of the pod images. 

By default, the scheduler does not consider the architecture of a pod's container images when determining the placement of new pods onto nodes.

To enable architecture-aware workload scheduling, you must create the `ClusterPodPlacementConfig` object. When you create the `ClusterPodPlacementConfig` object, the Multiarch Tuning Operator deploys the necessary operands to support architecture-aware workload scheduling.

When a pod is created, the operands perform the following actions: 

. Add the `multiarch.openshift.io/scheduling-gate` scheduling gate that prevents the scheduling of the pod.
. Compute a scheduling predicate that includes the supported architecture values for the `kubernetes.io/arch` label. 
. Integrate the scheduling predicate as a `nodeAffinity` requirement in the pod specification.
. Remove the scheduling gate from the pod.
 
[IMPORTANT]
====
Note the following operand behaviors:

* If the `nodeSelector` field is already configured with the `kubernetes.io/arch` label for a workload, the operand does not update the `nodeAffinity` field for that workload.

* If the `nodeSelector` field is not configured with the `kubernetes.io/arch` label for a workload, the operand updates the `nodeAffinity` field for that workload. However, in that `nodeAffinity` field, the operand updates only the node selector terms that are not configured with the `kubernetes.io/arch` label.

* If the `nodeName` field is already set, the Multiarch Tuning Operator does not process the pod.
