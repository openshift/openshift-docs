====
The Multiarch Tuning Operator is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red{nbsp}Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red{nbsp}Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red{nbsp}Hat Technology Preview features, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Support Scope].

The Multiarch Tuning Operator enhances the operational experience within multi-architecture clusters, and single-architecture clusters that are migrating to a multi-architecture compute configuration.

This Operator implements the `clusterpodplacementconfigs` custom resource (CR) to support architecture-aware workload scheduling.

To enable architecture-aware workload scheduling, you must create the `ClusterPodPlacementConfig` object. When you create the `ClusterPodPlacementConfig` object, this Operator deploys an operand.

When a pod is created, the operand performs the following actions: 

. Add the `multiarch.openshift.io/scheduling-gate` scheduling gate that prevents the scheduling of the pod.
. Compute a scheduling predicate that includes the supported architecture values for the `kubernetes.io/arch` label. 
. Integrate the scheduling predicate as a `nodeAffinity` requirement in the pod specification.
. Remove the scheduling gate from the pod.

When the operand removes the scheduling gate, the pod enters the scheduling cycle. The workload is then scheduled on nodes based on the supported architectures.

====
The Technology Preview version of the Multiarch Tuning Operator does not support clusters with restricted network scenarios.
