= Managing workloads on multi-architecture clusters by using the Multiarch Tuning Operator
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

The Multiarch Tuning Operator optimizes workload management within multi-architecture clusters and in single-architecture clusters transitioning to multi-architecture environments.

Architecture-aware workload scheduling allows the scheduler to place pods onto nodes that match the architecture of the pod images. 

By default, the scheduler does not consider the architecture of a pod's container images when determining the placement of new pods onto nodes.

To enable architecture-aware workload scheduling, you must create the `ClusterPodPlacementConfig` object. When you create the `ClusterPodPlacementConfig` object, the Multiarch Tuning Operator deploys the necessary operands to support architecture-aware workload scheduling. You can also use the `nodeAffinityScoring` plugin in the `ClusterPodPlacementConfig` object to set cluster-wide scores for node architectures. If you enable the `nodeAffinityScoring` plugin, the scheduler first filters nodes with compatible architectures and then places the pod on the node with the highest score.

When a pod is created, the operands perform the following actions: 

. Add the `multiarch.openshift.io/scheduling-gate` scheduling gate that prevents the scheduling of the pod.
. Compute a scheduling predicate that includes the supported architecture values for the `kubernetes.io/arch` label. 
. Integrate the scheduling predicate as a `nodeAffinity` requirement in the pod specification.
. Remove the scheduling gate from the pod.
 
[IMPORTANT]
====
Note the following operand behaviors:

* If the `nodeSelector` field is already configured with the `kubernetes.io/arch` label for a workload, the operand does not update the `nodeAffinity` field for that workload.

* If the `nodeSelector` field is not configured with the `kubernetes.io/arch` label for a workload, the operand updates the `nodeAffinity` field for that workload. However, in that `nodeAffinity` field, the operand updates only the node selector terms that are not configured with the `kubernetes.io/arch` label.

* If the `nodeName` field is already set, the Multiarch Tuning Operator does not process the pod.

* If the pod is owned by a DaemonSet, the operand does not update the the `nodeAffinity` field.

* If both `nodeSelector` or `nodeAffinity` and `preferredAffinity` fields are set for the `kubernetes.io/arch` label, the operand does not update the `nodeAffinity` field.

* If only `nodeSelector` or `nodeAffinity` field is set for the `kubernetes.io/arch` label and the `nodeAffinityScoring` plugin is disabled, the operand does not update the `nodeAffinity` field.

* If the `nodeAffinity.preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` field already contains terms that score nodes based on the `kubernetes.io/arch` label, the operand ignores the configuration in the `nodeAffinityScoring` plugin.
