[IMPORTANT]
====
The Multiarch Tuning Operator is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red{nbsp}Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red{nbsp}Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red{nbsp}Hat Technology Preview features, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Support Scope].

The Multiarch Tuning Operator enhances the operational experience within multi-architecture clusters, and single-architecture clusters that are migrating to a multi-architecture compute configuration. 

This Operator implements the `ClusterPodPlacementConfig` object to support architecture-aware workload scheduling.

When you create the `ClusterPodPlacementConfig` object, the Multiarch Tuning Operator deploys an operand. This operand automates the configuration of scheduling predicates for the workloads based on their supported architectures. It uses the `kubernetes.io/arch` label set by the kubelet in the node objects.

When a pod is created, the operand configures the `nodeAffinity` field in the pod specification by computing the subset of architectures that the pod can support.

Before a pod enters the scheduling cycle, the operand adds the `multiarch.openshift.io/scheduling-gate` scheduling gate that prevents the scheduling of the pod until the operand completes the following actions:

. Compute a predicate for the `kubernetes.io/arch` label. 
. Integrate the predicate as a `nodeAffinity` requirement in the pod specification.
. Remove the scheduling gate.

These operand actions restrict the scheduling of workloads to those nodes that have the supported architectures.

The Technology Preview version of the Multiarch Tuning Operator does not support clusters with restricted network scenarios.
