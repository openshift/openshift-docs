toc::[]

To create a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines on {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name} (`s390x`) with z/VM, you must have an existing single-architecture `x86_64` cluster. You can then add `s390x` compute machines to your {product-title} cluster.

Before you can add `s390x` nodes to your cluster, you must upgrade your cluster to one that uses the multi-architecture payload. For more information on migrating to the multi-architecture payload, see xref:../../updating/updating_a_cluster/migrating-to-multi-payload.adoc#migrating-to-multi-payload[Migrating to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines].

The following procedures explain how to create a {op-system} compute machine using a z/VM instance. This will allow you to add `s390x` nodes to your cluster and deploy a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines.
