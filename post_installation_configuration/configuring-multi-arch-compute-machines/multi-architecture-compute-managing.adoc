= Managing a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

Managing a cluster that has nodes with multiple architectures requires you to consider node architecture as you monitor the cluster and manage your workloads. This requires you to take additional considerations into account when you

configure cluster resource requirements and behavior, or
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa,openshift-rosa-hcp[]
schedule workloads in a multi-architecture cluster.
