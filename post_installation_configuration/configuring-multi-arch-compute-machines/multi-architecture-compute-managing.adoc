== Scheduling workloads on clusters with multi-architecture compute machines

Deploying a workload on a cluster with compute nodes of different architectures requires attention and monitoring of your cluster. There might be further actions you need to take in order to successfully place pods in the nodes of your cluster.

You can use the Multiarch Tuning Operator to enable architecture-aware scheduling of workloads on clusters with multi-architecture compute machines. The Multiarch Tuning Operator implements additional scheduler predicates in the pods specifications based on the architectures that the pods can support at creation time. For more information, see xref:../../post_installation_configuration/configuring-multi-arch-compute-machines/multiarch-tuning-operator.adoc#multiarch-tuning-operator[Managing workloads on multi-architecture clusters by using the Multiarch Tuning Operator].
