== Scheduling workloads on clusters with multi-architecture compute machines

Deploying a workload on a cluster with compute nodes of different architectures requires attention and monitoring of your cluster. There might be further actions you need to take in order to successfully place pods in the nodes of your cluster.

For more detailed information on node affinity, scheduling, taints and tolerlations, see the following documentatinon:
