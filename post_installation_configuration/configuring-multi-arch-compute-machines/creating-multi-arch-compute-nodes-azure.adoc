toc::[]

To deploy an Azure cluster with multi-architecture compute machines, you must first create a single-architecture Azure installer-provisioned cluster that uses the multi-architecture installer binary. For more information on Azure installations, see xref:../../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-customizations.adoc#installing-azure-customizations[Installing a cluster on Azure with customizations]. 

You can also migrate your current cluster with single-architecture compute machines to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines. For more information, see xref:../../updating/updating_a_cluster/migrating-to-multi-payload.adoc#migrating-to-multi-payload[Migrating to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines].

After creating a multi-architecture cluster, you can add nodes with different architectures to the cluster.
