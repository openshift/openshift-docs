For supported configurations, you can change how {product-title} authenticates with your cloud provider.

To determine which cloud credentials strategy your cluster uses, see xref:../authentication/managing_cloud_provider_credentials/about-cloud-credential-operator.adoc#cco-determine-mode_about-cloud-credential-operator[Determining the Cloud Credential Operator mode].

[id="post-install-rotate-remove-cloud-creds_{context}"]
== Rotating or removing cloud provider credentials

After installing {product-title}, some organizations require the rotation or removal of the cloud provider credentials that were used during the initial installation.

To allow the cluster to use the new credentials, you must update the secrets that the xref:../operators/operator-reference.adoc#cloud-credential-operator_cluster-operators-ref[Cloud Credential Operator (CCO)] uses to manage cloud provider credentials.

=== Rotating cloud provider credentials with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

// Right now only IBM can do this, but it makes sense to set this up so that other clouds can be added.
The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) utility `ccoctl` supports updating secrets for clusters installed on {ibm-cloud-name}.

== Enabling token-based authentication
//Today, just Entra. But this should be a section that anticipates the addition of AWS STS and GCP WID.

After installing an {azure-first} {product-title} cluster, you can enable {entra-first} to use short-term credentials.
