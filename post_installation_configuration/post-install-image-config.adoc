= Configuring image streams and image registries
:context: post-install-image-config

toc::[]

You can update the global pull secret for your cluster by either replacing the current pull secret or appending a new pull secret. The procedure is required when users use a separate registry to store images than the registry used during installation. For more information, see xref:../openshift_images/managing_images/using-image-pull-secrets.adoc#using-image-pull-secrets[Using image pull secrets].

For information about images and configuring image streams or image registries, see the following documentation:
