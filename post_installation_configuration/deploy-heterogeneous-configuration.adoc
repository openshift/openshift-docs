= Configuring a heterogeneous cluster
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

A heterogeneous cluster is a cluster that supports worker machines with different architectures. You can deploy a heterogeneous cluster by creating an Azure installer-provisioned cluster using the heterogeneous installer binary. For Azure installation, see xref:../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-customizations.adoc[Installing on Azure with customizations].

[WARNING]
====
The heterogeneous clusters Technology Preview feature has limited usability with installing, upgrading, and running payloads. 
====

The following procedures explain how to generate an `arm64` boot image and create an Azure machine set with the `arm64` boot image. This will add `arm64` worker nodes to your heterogeneous cluster and deploy the desired amount of ARM64 virtual machines (VM). This section also shows how to upgrade your existing cluster to a heterogeneous cluster. Heterogeneous clusters are only available on Azure installer-provisioned infrastructures with `x86_64` control planes.
