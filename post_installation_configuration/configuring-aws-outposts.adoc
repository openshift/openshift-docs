After xref:../installing/installing_aws/ipi/installing-aws-vpc.adoc#installing-aws-vpc[installing a cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) into an existing Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)], you can create a compute machine set that deploys compute machines in AWS Outposts.
AWS Outposts is an AWS edge compute service that enables using many features of a cloud-based AWS deployment with the reduced latency of an on-premise environment.
For more information, see the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/[AWS Outposts documentation].

== Obtaining information about your environment

To extend an AWS VPC cluster to your Outpost, you must provide information about your {product-title} cluster and your Outpost environment.
You use this information to complete network configuration tasks and configure a compute machine set that creates compute machines in your Outpost.
You can use command-line tools to gather the required details.

[id="aws-outposts-network-config_{context}"]
== Configuring your network for your Outpost

To extend your VPC cluster into an Outpost, you must complete the following network configuration tasks:

* Change the Cluster Network MTU.
* Create a subnet in your Outpost.

== Scheduling workloads on edge and cloud-based AWS compute resources

When you extend an AWS VPC cluster into an Outpost, the Outpost uses edge compute nodes and the VPC uses cloud-based compute nodes.
The following load balancer considerations apply to an AWS VPC cluster extended into an Outpost:

* Outposts cannot run AWS Network Load Balancers or AWS Classic Load Balancers, but a Classic Load Balancer for a VPC cluster extended into an Outpost can attach to the Outpost edge compute nodes.
For more information, see xref:../post_installation_configuration/configuring-aws-outposts.adoc#aws-outposts-load-balancer-clb_configuring-aws-outposts[Using AWS Classic Load Balancers in an AWS VPC cluster extended into an Outpost].

* To run a load balancer on an Outpost instance, you must use an AWS Application Load Balancer.
You can use the AWS Load Balancer Operator to deploy an instance of the AWS Load Balancer Controller.
The controller provisions AWS Application Load Balancers for Kubernetes Ingress resources.
