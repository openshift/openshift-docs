toc::[]

An {product-title} cluster with multi-architecture compute machines is a cluster that supports compute machines with different architectures. You can deploy a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines by creating an Azure installer-provisioned cluster using the multi-architecture installer binary. For Azure installation, see xref:../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-customizations.adoc[Installing a cluster on Azure with customizations].

[WARNING]
====
The multi-architecture compute machines Technology Preview feature has limited usability with installing, upgrading, and running payloads. 
====

The following procedures explain how to generate an `arm64` boot image and create an Azure compute machine set with the `arm64` boot image. This adds `arm64` compute nodes to your cluster and deploys the desired amount of `arm64` virtual machines (VM). This section also shows how to upgrade your existing cluster to a cluster that supports multi-architecture compute machines. Clusters with multi-architecture compute machines are only available on Azure installer-provisioned infrastructures with `x86_64` control plane machines.
