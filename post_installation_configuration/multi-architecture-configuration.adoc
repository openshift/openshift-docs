= Configuring multi-architecture compute machines on an {product-title} cluster 
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

An {product-title} cluster with multi-architecture compute machines is a cluster that supports compute machines with different architectures. Clusters with multi-architecture compute machines are available only on AWS or Azure installer-provisioned infrastructures and bare metal user-provisioned infrastructures with `x86_64` control plane machines.

[NOTE]
====
When there are nodes with multiple architectures in your cluster, the architecture of your image must be consistent with the architecture of the node. You need to ensure that the pod is assigned to the node with the appropriate architecture and that it matches the image architecture. For more information on assigning pods to nodes, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/[Assigning pods to nodes].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Cluster Samples Operator is not supported on clusters with multi-architecture compute machines. Your cluster can be created without this capability. For more information, see xref:../post_installation_configuration/enabling-cluster-capabilities.adoc#enabling-cluster-capabilities[Enabling cluster capabilities]

== Creating a cluster with multi-architecture compute machine on Azure 

To deploy an Azure cluster with multi-architecture compute machines, you must first create a single-architecture Azure installer-provisioned cluster that uses the multi-architecture installer binary. For more information on Azure installations, see xref:../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-customizations.adoc[Installing a cluster on Azure with customizations]. You can then add an `arm64` compute machine set to your cluster to create a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines. 

The following procedures explain how to generate an `arm64` boot image and create an Azure compute machine set that uses the `arm64` boot image. This adds `arm64` compute nodes to your cluster and deploys the amount of `arm64` virtual machines (VM) that you need.

== Creating a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines on AWS

To create an AWS cluster with multi-architecture compute machines, you must first create a single-architecture AWS installer-provisioned cluster with the multi-architecture installer binary. For more information on AWS installations, refer to xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-customizations.adoc[Installing a cluster on AWS with customizations]. You can then add a ARM64 compute machine set to your AWS cluster.
