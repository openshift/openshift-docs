After installing {product-title}, you can further expand and customize your
cluster to your requirements.

[id="post-install-adjust-worker-nodes"]
== Adjust worker nodes
If you incorrectly sized the worker nodes during deployment, adjust them by
creating one or more new MachineSets, scale them up, then scale the original
MachineSet down before removing them.

== Creating infrastructure MachineSets

You can create a MachineSet to host only infrastructure components.
You apply specific Kubernetes labels to these Machines and then
update the infrastructure components to run on only those Machines. These
infrastructure nodes are not counted toward the total number of subscriptions
that are required to run the environment.

[id="post-install-creating-infrastructure-machinesets-production"]
=== Creating infrastructure MachineSets for production environments

In a production deployment, deploy at least three MachineSets to hold
infrastructure components. Both the logging aggregation solution and
the service mesh deploy Elasticsearch, and Elasticsearch requires three
instances that are installed on different nodes. For high availability, install
deploy these nodes to different availability zones. Since you need different
MachineSets for each availability zone, create at least three MachineSets.

[id="post-install-rotate-cloud-creds"]
== Rotating cloud provider credentials
Some organizations require the rotation of the cloud provider credentials that were used to install {product-title} after installation. The xref:../operators/operator-reference.adoc#cloud-credential-operator_red-hat-operators[Cloud Credential Operator (CCO)] manages cloud provider credentials and can be configured to operate in several different modes. The process for rotating cloud credentials depends on the mode that the CCO is configured to use.

[id="cred-rotation-cco-mode-mint"]
=== Rotating credentials with the Cloud Credential Operator in mint mode
When the CCO is configured to operate in _mint mode_, it uses the provided admin-level cloud credential to create new credentials for each component with only the specific permissions that are required.

To rotate credentials in mint mode, you must manually remove the component credentials that were created by the removed credential.

. Update the admin credentials root secret for your cloud provider.

. Delete each component secret that is referenced by the individual `CredentialsRequest` objects.

The CCO uses the new admin-level cloud credential to create new credentials for each component.

[id="cred-rotation-cco-mode-passthrough"]
=== Rotating credentials with the Cloud Credential Operator in passthrough mode
When the CCO is configured to operate in _passthrough mode_, it passes the provided cloud credential to the components that request cloud credentials. The credential must have permissions to perform the installation and complete the operations that are required by components in the cluster, but does not need to be able to create new credentials.

After rotating the passthrough mode cloud credential, it can take up to 11 hours to propagate the new credential to all of the components that need it. During this time, the cluster might not be fully operational. To reduce the time to propagate the new credential, delete the CCO pod. Deleting the CCO pod causes the CCO to immediately propagate the new credential, which can take up to an hour to complete.
