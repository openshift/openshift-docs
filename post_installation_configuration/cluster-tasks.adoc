After installing {product-title}, you can further expand and customize your cluster to your requirements.

[id="available_cluster_customizations"]
== Available cluster customizations

You complete most of the cluster configuration and customization after you deploy your {product-title} cluster. A number of _configuration resources_ are available.

[NOTE]
====
If you install your cluster on IBM Z, not all features and functions are available.
====

You modify the configuration resources to configure the major features of the
cluster, such as the image registry, networking configuration, image build
behavior, and the identity provider.

For current documentation of the settings that you control by using these resources, use
the `oc explain` command, for example `oc explain builds --api-version=config.openshift.io/v1`

[id="configuration-resources_{context}"]
=== Cluster configuration resources

All cluster configuration resources are globally scoped (not namespaced) and named `cluster`.
////
Config changes should not require coordinated changes between config resources, if you find
yourself struggling to update these docs to explain coordinated changes, please reach out
to @api-approvers (github) or #forum-api-review (slack).

[id="post-install-adjust-worker-nodes"]
== Adjust worker nodes
If you incorrectly sized the worker nodes during deployment, adjust them by creating one or more new machine sets, scale them up, then scale the original machine set down before removing them.

[id="post-install-creating-infrastructure-machinesets-production"]
== Creating infrastructure machine sets for production environments

You can create a machine set to create machines that host only infrastructure components, such as the default router, the integrated container image registry, and components for cluster metrics and monitoring. These infrastructure machines are not counted toward the total number of subscriptions that are required to run the environment.

In a production deployment, it is recommended that you deploy at least three machine sets to hold infrastructure components.  Both OpenShift Logging and {ProductName} deploy Elasticsearch, which requires three instances to be installed on different nodes. Each of these nodes can be deployed to different availability zones for high availability. A configuration like this requires three different machine sets, one for each availability zone.

For information on infrastructure nodes and which components can run on infrastructure nodes, see xref:../machine_management/creating-infrastructure-machinesets.adoc#creating-infrastructure-machinesets[Creating infrastructure machine sets].

For sample machine sets that you can use with these procedures, see xref:../machine_management/creating-infrastructure-machinesets.adoc#creating-infrastructure-machinesets-clouds[Creating machine sets for different clouds].

[id="assigning-machine-set-resources-to-infra-nodes"]
== Assigning machine set resources to infrastructure nodes

After creating an infrastructure machine set, the `worker` and `infra` roles are applied to new infra nodes. Nodes with the `infra` role are not counted toward the total number of subscriptions that are required to run the environment, even when the `worker` role is also applied.

However, when an infra node is assigned the worker role, there is a chance that user workloads can get assigned inadvertently to the infra node. To avoid this, you can apply a taint to the infra node and tolerations for the pods that you want to control.
