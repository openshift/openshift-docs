After installing {product-title}, you can further expand and customize your cluster to your requirements.

[id="post-install-adjust-worker-nodes"]
== Adjust worker nodes
If you incorrectly sized the worker nodes during deployment, adjust them by creating one or more new machine sets, scale them up, then scale the original machine set down before removing them.

[id="post-install-creating-infrastructure-machinesets"]
== Creating infrastructure machine sets

You can create a `MachineSet` object to host only infrastructure components. You apply specific Kubernetes labels to these machines and then update the infrastructure components to run on only those machines. These infrastructure nodes are not counted toward the total number of subscriptions that are required to run the environment.

[id="moving-resources-to-infrastructure-machinesets"]
== Moving resources to infrastructure machine sets

Some of the infrastructure resources are deployed in your cluster by default. You can move them to the infrastructure machine sets that you created.

[id="post-install-creating-infrastructure-machinesets-production"]
=== Creating infrastructure machine sets for production environments

In a production deployment, deploy at least three machine sets to hold infrastructure components. Both the logging aggregation solution and the service mesh deploy Elasticsearch, and Elasticsearch requires three instances that are installed on different nodes. For high availability, install deploy these nodes to different availability zones. Since you need different machine sets for each availability zone, create at least three machine sets.

=== Creating machine sets for different clouds

Use the sample machine set for your cloud.

Machine sets running on AWS support non-guaranteed xref:../machine_management/creating_machinesets/creating-machineset-aws.adoc#creating-machineset-aws[Spot Instances]. You can save on costs by using Spot Instances at a lower price compared to On-Demand Instances on AWS. xref:../machine_management/creating_machinesets/creating-machineset-aws.adoc#creating-machineset-aws[Configure Spot Instances] by adding `spotMarketOptions` to the machine set YAML file.
