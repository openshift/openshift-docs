After installing {product-title}, you can further expand and customize your cluster to your requirements.

[id="available_cluster_customizations"]
== Available cluster customizations

You complete most of the cluster configuration and customization after you deploy your {product-title} cluster. A number of _configuration resources_ are available.

[NOTE]
====
If you install your cluster on {ibm-z-name}, not all features and functions are available.
====

You modify the configuration resources to configure the major features of the
cluster, such as the image registry, networking configuration, image build
behavior, and the identity provider.

For current documentation of the settings that you control by using these resources, use
the `oc explain` command, for example `oc explain builds --api-version=config.openshift.io/v1`

[id="configuration-resources_{context}"]
=== Cluster configuration resources

All cluster configuration resources are globally scoped (not namespaced) and named `cluster`.
////
Config changes should not require coordinated changes between config resources, if you find
yourself struggling to update these docs to explain coordinated changes, please reach out
to @api-approvers (github) or #forum-api-review (slack).

[id="adding-worker-nodes_{context}"]
== Adding worker nodes

After you deploy your {product-title} cluster, you can add worker nodes to scale cluster resources. There are different ways you can add worker nodes depending on the installation method and the environment of your cluster.

=== Adding worker nodes to installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters

For installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters, you can manually or automatically scale the `MachineSet` object to match the number of available bare-metal hosts.

To add a bare-metal host, you must configure all network prerequisites, configure an associated `baremetalhost` object, then provision the worker node to the cluster. You can add a bare-metal host manually or by using the web console.

* xref:../scalability_and_performance/managing-bare-metal-hosts.adoc#adding-bare-metal-host-to-cluster-using-web-console_managing-bare-metal-hosts[Adding worker nodes using the web console]

* xref:../scalability_and_performance/managing-bare-metal-hosts.adoc#adding-bare-metal-host-to-cluster-using-yaml_managing-bare-metal-hosts[Adding worker nodes using YAML in the web console]

* xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-expanding-the-cluster.adoc#preparing-the-bare-metal-node_ipi-install-expanding[Manually adding a worker node to an installer-provisioned infrastructure cluster]

=== Adding worker nodes to user-provisioned infrastructure clusters

For user-provisioned infrastructure clusters, you can add worker nodes by using a {op-system-base} or {op-system} ISO image and connecting it to your cluster using cluster Ignition config files. For RHEL worker nodes, the following example uses Ansible playbooks to add worker nodes to the cluster. For RHCOS worker nodes, the following example uses an ISO image and network booting to add worker nodes to the cluster.

* xref:../post_installation_configuration/node-tasks.adoc#post-install-config-adding-rhel-compute[Adding RHEL worker nodes to a user-provisioned infrastructure cluster]

=== Adding worker nodes to clusters managed by the Assisted Installer

For clusters managed by the Assisted Installer, you can add worker nodes by using the {cluster-manager-first} console, the Assisted Installer REST API or you can manually add worker nodes using an ISO image and cluster Ignition config files.

* xref:../nodes/nodes/nodes-sno-worker-nodes.adoc#sno-adding-worker-nodes-to-sno-clusters_add-workers[Adding worker nodes using the OpenShift Cluster Manager]

* xref:../nodes/nodes/nodes-sno-worker-nodes.adoc#sno-adding-worker-nodes-to-single-node-clusters-manually_add-workers[Manually adding worker nodes to a SNO cluster]

=== Adding worker nodes to clusters managed by the multicluster engine for Kubernetes

For clusters managed by the multicluster engine for Kubernetes, you can add worker nodes by using the dedicated multicluster engine console.

[id="post-install-adjust-worker-nodes"]
== Adjust worker nodes
If you incorrectly sized the worker nodes during deployment, adjust them by creating one or more new compute machine sets, scale them up, then scale the original compute machine set down before removing them.

== Managing control plane machines

xref:../machine_management/control_plane_machine_management/cpmso-about.adoc#cpmso-about[Control plane machine sets] provide management capabilities for control plane machines that are similar to what compute machine sets provide for compute machines. The availability and initial status of control plane machine sets on your cluster depend on your cloud provider and the version of {product-title} that you installed. For more information, see xref:../machine_management/control_plane_machine_management/cpmso-getting-started.adoc#cpmso-getting-started[Getting started with control plane machine sets].

[id="post-install-creating-infrastructure-machinesets-production"]
== Creating infrastructure machine sets for production environments

You can create a compute machine set to create machines that host only infrastructure components, such as the default router, the integrated container image registry, and components for cluster metrics and monitoring. These infrastructure machines are not counted toward the total number of subscriptions that are required to run the environment.

In a production deployment, it is recommended that you deploy at least three compute machine sets to hold infrastructure components. Both OpenShift Logging and {SMProductName} deploy Elasticsearch, which requires three instances to be installed on different nodes. Each of these nodes can be deployed to different availability zones for high availability. A configuration like this requires three different compute machine sets, one for each availability zone. In global Azure regions that do not have multiple availability zones, you can use availability sets to ensure high availability.

For information on infrastructure nodes and which components can run on infrastructure nodes, see xref:../machine_management/creating-infrastructure-machinesets.adoc#creating-infrastructure-machinesets[Creating infrastructure machine sets].

To create an infrastructure node, you can xref:../post_installation_configuration/cluster-tasks.adoc#machineset-creating_post-install-cluster-tasks[use a machine set], xref:../post_installation_configuration/cluster-tasks.adoc#creating-an-infra-node_post-install-cluster-tasks[assign a label to the nodes], or xref:../post_installation_configuration/cluster-tasks.adoc#creating-infra-machines_post-install-cluster-tasks[use a machine config pool].

For sample machine sets that you can use with these procedures, see xref:../machine_management/creating-infrastructure-machinesets.adoc#creating-infrastructure-machinesets-clouds[Creating machine sets for different clouds].

Applying a specific node selector to all infrastructure components causes {product-title} to xref:../post_installation_configuration/cluster-tasks.adoc#moving-resources-to-infrastructure-machinesets[schedule those workloads on nodes with that label].

[id="assigning-machine-set-resources-to-infra-nodes"]
== Assigning machine set resources to infrastructure nodes

After creating an infrastructure machine set, the `worker` and `infra` roles are applied to new infra nodes. Nodes with the `infra` role are not counted toward the total number of subscriptions that are required to run the environment, even when the `worker` role is also applied.

However, when an infra node is assigned the worker role, there is a chance that user workloads can get assigned inadvertently to the infra node. To avoid this, you can apply a taint to the infra node and tolerations for the pods that you want to control.
