After installing {product-title}, you can further expand and customize your
cluster to your requirements.

== Adjust worker nodes
If you incorrectly sized the worker nodes during deployment, adjust them by
creating one or more new MachineSets, scale them up, then scale the original
MachineSet down before removing them.

== Creating infrastructure MachineSets

You can create a MachineSet to host only infrastructure components.
You apply specific Kubernetes labels to these Machines and then
update the infrastructure components to run on only those Machines. These
infrastructure nodes are not counted toward the total number of subscriptions
that are required to run the environment.

[id="post-install-creating-infrastructure-machinesets-production"]
=== Creating infrastructure MachineSets for production environments

In a production deployment, deploy at least three MachineSets to hold
infrastructure components. Both the logging aggregation solution and
the service mesh deploy Elasticsearch, and Elasticsearch requires three
instances that are installed on different nodes. For high availability, install
deploy these nodes to different availability zones. Since you need different
MachineSets for each availability zone, create at least three MachineSets.
