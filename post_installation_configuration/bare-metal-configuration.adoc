When deploying {product-title} on bare metal hosts, there are times when you need to make changes to the host either before or after provisioning. This can include inspecting the host's hardware, firmware, and BIOS details. It can also include formatting disks or changing modifiable BIOS settings. There are two resources that you can use with the Bare Metal Operator (BMO):

* `BareMetalHost`
* `HostFirmwareSettings`

There is also a read-only `FirmwareSchema` resource, which you can use to validate that you are sending correct values to a host when making changes to host firmware settings.
