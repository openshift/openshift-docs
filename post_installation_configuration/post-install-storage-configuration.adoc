== Dynamic provisioning

Dynamic Provisioning allows you to create storage volumes on-demand, eliminating the need for cluster administrators to pre-provision storage. See xref:../storage/dynamic-provisioning.adoc#dynamic-provisioning[Dynamic provisioning].

{rh-storage-first} is a provider of agnostic persistent storage for {product-title} supporting file, block, and object storage, either in-house or in hybrid clouds. As a Red Hat storage solution, {rh-storage-first} is completely integrated with {product-title} for deployment, management, and monitoring. For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation[{rh-storage-first} documentation].

[IMPORTANT]
====
{rh-storage} on top of Red Hat Hyperconverged Infrastructure (RHHI) for Virtualization, which uses hyperconverged nodes that host virtual machines installed with {product-title}, is not a supported configuration. For more information about supported platforms, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4731161[Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation Supportability and Interoperability Guide].
