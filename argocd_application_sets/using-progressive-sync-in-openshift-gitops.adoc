[IMPORTANT]
====
This is an experimental, alpha-quality feature. It allows you to control the order in which the `ApplicationSet` controller creates or updates the Applications owned by an `ApplicationSet` resource. The feature might be removed in future releases or changed in a non-backwards-compatible way. For more information, see the upstream documentation for link:https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj/blob/main/community/feature-status.md#alpha[Feature Status in Argo Projects (Github docs)].
====

Progressive Sync is an advanced feature that improves application rollout strategies by managing synchronization stages across multiple clusters. {gitops-shortname}, based on Argo CD, introduces a *Progressive Sync* status panel in the *Application details* view. This enhancement allows administrators to visually monitor rollout waves, synchronization status, and application health during deployments managed by an `ApplicationSet` controller with a `RollingSync` strategy.

You can now use the {gitops-title} console to display real-time Progressive sync status, improve operational awareness, and simplify troubleshooting during staged rollouts.

[id="prerequisites_{context}"]
== Prerequisites

* You have logged in to the {OCP} cluster as an administrator.
* You have installed the {gitops-shortname} Operator on your {OCP} cluster.
* You can access the default Argo CD instance in the `openshift-gitops` namespace.
* You have created an Argo CD ApplicationSet in your defined namespace, for example, `openshift-gitops`.
* You have created a few Argo CD applications using an Argo CD ApplicationSet, which is defined in your namespace, for example, `openshift-gitops`.
