Disconnected Installation Guide For OpenShift 3
-----------------------------------------------

Assumptions
~~~~~~~~~~~

This document assumes that you understand the overall architecture of OpenShift
3 and that you have already planned out what the topology of your environment
will look like. If you do not have a thorough understanding of the architecture
of OpenShift 3, the service layer, projects, and how topologies are configured
via the scheduler, there are steps in this document that may not make sense.
This document also assumes that you have some understanding of Docker,
registries, and Docker’s command line tools.

Required Software and Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is frequently the case that portions of a datacenter environment may not
have any access to the internet, even via proxy servers. Installing OpenShift
in these environments is considered a “disconnected installation”.

An OpenShift Enterprise disconnected installation differs from a regular
installation two primary ways:

1. *Access to OpenShift Software Channels/Repos*: The OpenShift software channels
   will not be available via Red Hat’s content distribution network. Usually
   customers in such situations have a Satellite server that provides access to
   Red Hat content via the intranet/LAN. But, in some cases, there may not be a
   Satellite.
2. *Access to OpenShift Dockerized Components*: OpenShift uses several Dockerized
   components. Normally these images are pulled directly from Red Hat’s Docker
   registry. In a disconnected environment, this is not possible.

This document details providing access to the OpenShift software when Satellite
is not available in the environment. For environments with Satellite, it is
assumed that someone can synchronize the OpenShift software into the Satellite
for use with the OpenShift servers. Once the OpenShift software is made
available to the relevant servers, the installation process is the same as a
standard “connected” installation.

This document additionally details manually downloading the Docker images and
how to transport them onto the relevant servers. Satellite 6.1 introduces the
ability to act as a Docker registry, and it can be used to host the OpenShift
dockerized components. Doing so is outside of scope for this document.

Once installed, in order to use OpenShift, you will need source code in a
source control repository (current Git). We assume that an internal git
repository is available that can host source code and this repository is
accessible from the OpenShift nodes. Installing the source control repository
is out of scope of this document.

Also when you try to build applications in OpenShift, your build may have some
external dependencies such as a Maven Repository or Gem files (for Ruby). By
default, the docker images provided by RedHat try to reach out to external
repositories on internet. You can configure to use your own internal
repositories. For the purposes of this document, we assume that such internal
repositories already exist and are accessible from the OpenShift nodes.
Installing such repositories is outside the scope of this document.

Software and Docker Image Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to pull down the required software repositories and Docker images, you
will need a RHEL7 server with access to the internet and at least 100GB of
additional free space. All steps in this section should be performed on the
internet-connected server. It is assumed that all steps will be performed as
the root system user.

Syncing Repositories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, register the server with Red Hat’s customer portal. You will need to use
the login and password associated with the account that has access to the
OpenShift subscriptions.

[code]
# subscription-manager register

Next, you will need to attach to a subscription that provides OpenShift
channels. You can find the list of available subscriptions using: 

[code]
# subscription-manager list --available

Find the pool ID for the subscription that provides OpenShift, and then:

[code]
# subscription-manager attach --pool=${pool_id}
# subscription-manager repos --disable="*"
# subscription-manager repos \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.1-rpms"

Lastly, yum-utils provides “reposync” which lets you mirror yum repositories,
and createrepo can create a “usable” yum repository from a directory.

[code]
# yum -y install yum-utils createrepo docker git

You will need up to 110GB of free space in order to sync the software.
Depending on how restrictive your organization’s policies are, you could
re-connect this server to the disconnected LAN and use it as the repository
server. You could use USB-connected storage and transport the software to
another server that will act as the repository server. There are even more
options, but this document only covers these first two.

Make a path to where you want to sync the software (either locally or on your
USB or other device):

[code]
# mkdir -p /path/to/repos

Now sync the packages and create the repo for each of them. Note you will need
to modify the command for the appropriate path you created above.

[code]
# for repo in \
rhel-7-server-rpms rhel-7-server-extras-rpms \
rhel-7-server-ose-3.1-rpms
do
  reposync --gpgcheck -lmn --repoid=${repo} --download_path=/path/to/repos
  createrepo -v /path/to/repos/${repo}
done

Syncing Images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start the Docker daemon:

[code]
# systemctl start docker

The next commands will pull all of the required OpenShift dockerized components:

[code]
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-haproxy-router:v3.1.0.4
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-deployer:v3.1.0.4
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-sti-builder:v3.1.0.4
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-docker-builder:v3.1.0.4
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-pod:v3.1.0.4
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-docker-registry:v3.1.0.4

The next commands will pull all of the required OpenShift dockerized components
for the additional centralized log aggregation and metrics aggregation
components:

[code]
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-deployment
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-elasticsearch
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-kibana
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-fluentd
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-auth-proxy
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/metrics-deployer
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/metrics-hawkular-metrics
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/metrics-cassandra
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/metrics-heapster

The next commands will pull Red Hat’s certified Source-to-Image (S2I) builder
images. Source-to-Image (S2I) is the process that OpenShift uses to take
application code and build it into a Docker image to run on the platform. More
information about S2I can be found in the documentation, here:

https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build

If there are any languages, runtimes or databases that you do not wish to use,
you can skip them.

[code]
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-amq-6/amq-openshift
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-eap-6/eap-openshift 
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-webserver-3/tomcat7-openshift
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-webserver-3/tomcat8-openshift
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/mongodb-26-rhel7
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/mysql-56-rhel7
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/perl-520-rhel7
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/php-56-rhel7
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/postgresql-94-rhel7
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/python-27-rhel7
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/python-34-rhel7
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/ruby-22-rhel7
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/nodejs-010-rhel7 

Prepare Images for Export
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Docker images may be exported from a system by first saving them to a tarball
and then transporting them. Change to root’s home directory:

[code]
# mkdir /path/to/repos/images
# cd /path/to/repos/images

Export the OpenShift Dockerized components as follows:

[code]
# docker save -o ose3-images.tar \
registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-haproxy-router \
registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-deployer \
registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-sti-builder \
registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-docker-builder \
registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-pod \
registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-docker-registry 

If you synchronized the metrics and log aggregation images, export them as follows:

[code]
# docker save -o ose3-logging-metrics-images.tar \
registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-deployment \
registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-elasticsearch \
registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-kibana \
registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-fluentd \
registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-auth-proxy \
registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/metrics-deployer \
registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/metrics-hawkular-metrics \
registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/metrics-cassandra \
registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/metrics-heapster

Export the S2I builder images as follows, making sure to remove any items that
you did not sync in the previous section:

[code]
# docker save -o ose3-builder-images.tar \
registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-amq-6/amq-openshift \
registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-eap-6/eap-openshift \
registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-webserver-3/tomcat7-openshift \
registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-webserver-3/tomcat8-openshift \
registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/mongodb-26-rhel7 \
registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/mysql-56-rhel7 \
registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/perl-520-rhel7 \
registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/php-56-rhel7 \
registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/postgresql-94-rhel7 \
registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/python-27-rhel7 \
registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/python-34-rhel7 \
registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/ruby-22-rhel7 \
registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/nodejs-010-rhel7  

Repository Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During the installation (and for later updates, should you so choose) you will
need a webserver to host the repositories. RHEL7 can provide the Apache
webserver, and its installation and configuration are documented in the
following steps.

*Option 1*: Re-configure as a Web server

If you can re-connect the server where you synchronized the software and images
to your LAN, then you can simply install Apache on it. Otherwise, you will need
to provision a new server (see Option 2).

Installation of Apache is simple:

[code]
# yum -y install httpd

Skip to “Placing the Software”.

*Option 2*: Building a Repository Server

If you need to build a separate server to act as the repository server, install
a new RHEL7 system with at least 110GB of space. On this repo server during the
installation make sure you select “Basic Web Server”.

**image of software selection**

Placing the Software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If necessary, attach the external storage, and then copy/move the repository
files into Apache’s root folder. Note that the below copy step should be
substituted with move (mv) if you are repurposing the server you used to sync.

[code]
# cp -a /path/to/repos/* /var/www/html/
# chmod -R +r /var/www/html/repos
# restorecon -vR /var/www/html

Make sure to add the firewall rules:

[code]
# firewall-cmd --add-service=http
# firewall-cmd --reload

Now start and enable Apache:

[code]
# systemctl enable httpd
# systemctl start httpd

OpenShift Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build Your Hosts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At this point you can perform the initial build of the hosts that will be part
of the OpenShift environment. It is recommended to use the latest version of
Red Hat Enterprise Linux and to perform a minimal installation. You will also
want to pay attention to the other OpenShift-specific prerequisites, documented
here:

https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/install_config/install/prerequisites.html 

(Overview, System, and Environment Requirements)

Once the hosts are initially built, the repositories can be set up.

Connecting The Repos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On all of the relevant systems that will need OpenShift software components,
create the following repository definitions, replacing <ip of the server> with
the IP or hostname of the Apache server hosting the software repositories (use
the editor of your choice):

[code]
# vi /etc/yum.repos.d/ose.repo

Place the following text in the file:

[code]
[rhel-7-server-rpms]
name=rhel-7-server-rpms
baseurl=http://<ip of the server>/repos/rhel-7-server-rpms
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
[rhel-7-server-extras-rpms]
name=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
baseurl=http://<ip of the server>/repos/rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
[rhel-7-server-ose-3.1-rpms]
name=rhel-7-server-ose-3.1-rpms
baseurl=http://<ip of the server>/repos/rhel-7-server-ose-3.1-rpms
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

Host Preparation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At this point, the systems are ready to continue to be prepared following the
OpenShift documentation. See the following section:

https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/install_config/install/prerequisites.html#host-preparation 

Skip the section titled “Registering the Hosts” and start with “Managing Packages”.

OpenShift Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Import OpenShift Dockerized Components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can simply scp the images from the sync server to the individual OpenShift
hosts:

[code]
# scp /var/www/html/images/ose3-images.tar root@openshift.host.name:
# ssh root@openshift.host.name "docker load -i ose3-images.tar"

If you prefer, you could use wget on each OpenShift host to fetch the tar file
and then perform the Docker import command locally. Perform the same steps for
the metrics and logging images, if you synchronized them.

On one of the hosts that will act as an OpenShift Master, copy and import the builder images:

[code]
# scp /var/www/html/images/ose3-builder-images.tar root@openshift.masterhost.name:
# ssh root@openshift.masterhost.name "docker load -i ose3-builder-images.tar"

Run OpenShift Installer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may now follow the rest of the OpenShift installation instructions in the
documentation. See the following section:

https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/install_config/install/advanced_install.html 

Create the Internal Docker Registry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You now need to create the internal Docker registry. See the following section
of the documentation:

https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/install_config/install/docker_registry.html 

Post-Installation Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In one of the previous steps, the S2I images were imported into the Docker
daemon running on one of the OpenShift Master hosts. In a typical connected
installation these images would be pulled from Red Hat’s registry on demand.
Since the internet is not available to do this, the images must be made
available in some other Docker registry.

OpenShift provides an internal registry for storing the images that are built
as a result of the S2I process, but it can also be used to hold the S2I builder
images. The following steps assume you did not customize the service IP subnet
(172.30.0.0/16) or the Docker registry port (5000).

Re-tag S2I Builder Images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, on the Master host where you imported the S2I builder images, obtain the
service address of your docker registry that we installed on the master
earlier:

[code]
# export REGISTRY=$(oc get service docker-registry -t '{{.spec.clusterIP}}{{"\n"}}')

Next, tag all of the builder images before pushing them into the OpenShift Docker registry:

[code]
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-amq-6/amq-openshift $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/amq-openshift
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-eap-6/eap-openshift $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/eap-openshift 
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-webserver-3/tomcat7-openshift $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/tomcat7-openshift
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-webserver-3/tomcat8-openshift $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/tomcat8-openshift
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/mongodb-26-rhel7 $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/mongodb-26-rhel7
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/mysql-56-rhel7 $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/mysql-56-rhel7
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/perl-520-rhel7 $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/perl-520-rhel7
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/php-56-rhel7 $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/php-56-rhel7
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/postgresql-94-rhel7 $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/postgresql-94-rhel7
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/python-27-rhel7 $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/python-27-rhel7
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/python-34-rhel7 $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/python-34-rhel7 
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/ruby-22-rhel7 $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/ruby-22-rhel7
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/nodejs-010-rhel7 $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/nodejs-010-rhel7 

Create an Administrative User
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to be able to push the Docker images into OpenShift’s Docker registry,
you will need a user with sufficient privileges. Because the default OpenShift
system administrator does not have a standard authorization token, it cannot to
use to login to the Docker registry.

Create a new user account in whatever authentication system you are using with
OpenShift. For example, if you are using local htpasswd-based authentication:

[code]
# htpasswd -b /etc/openshift/openshift-passwd adminuser <yourpasswd>

OpenShift does not create an “account” for the user just because the external
authentication system has an account. A user must log-in to OpenShift before an
account is actually created in the internal database. You must log-in to
OpenShift for this account to be created. This assumes you are using the
self-signed certificates generated by OpenShift during the installation:

[code]
# oc login --certificate-authority=/etc/origin/master/ca.crt -u adminuser https://openshift.master.host:8443

Get the user’s authentication token:

[code]
# MYTOKEN=$(oc whoami -t)
# echo $MYTOKEN
iwo7hc4XilD2KOLL4V1O55ExH2VlPmLD-W2-JOd6Fko

Modify the Security Policies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since you have now switched the user associated with the host’s root system
account, you must re-log-in as the OpenShift system administrator in order to
make policy changes:

[code]
# oc login -u system:admin

Remember, the “login” command merely changes the account credentials that the
CLI is using to communicate with OpenShift’s API.

In order to push images into the OpenShift Docker registry, an account must
have the image-builder security role. Add this to your admin user:

[code]
# oadm policy add-role-to-user system:image-builder adminuser

Next, add the admin (administrative) role to the user in the special
“openshift” project. This will allow the admin user to be able to edit the
“openshift” project - in this case, to push the Docker images.

[code]
# oadm policy add-role-to-user admin adminuser -n openshift

Edit the Image Stream Definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The “openshift” project is where all of the imagestreams for builder images are
created by the installer. They are loaded by the installer from the
/usr/share/openshift/examples folder. Since we need to change all of the
definitions, we will first delete what has been loaded into OpenShift’s
database and then re-create them.

First, delete the existing imagestreams:

[code]
# oc delete is -n openshift --all

Make a backup of the files in /usr/share/openshift/examples/ if you desire.
Next, edit the file image-streams-rhel7.json in
/usr/share/openshift/examples/image-streams folder. You will find an
imagestream section for each of the builder images. Edit the “spec” stanza to
point to your internal docker registry. For example

[code]
"spec": {
  "dockerImageRepository": "registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/mongodb-26-rhel7",

would change to

[code]
"spec": {
  "dockerImageRepository": "172.30.69.44:5000/openshift/mongodb-26-rhel7",

Note that the repository name (rhscl) was changed to openshift. You will need
to make that change regardless of whether the repository is rhscl, openshift3,
or something else. Every definition should have the following format:

[code]
REGISTRY_IP:5000/openshift/IMAGENAME

Repeat this for every imagestream in the file. Make sure you use the correct IP
address that you determined earlier. When you are finished, save and exit.
Repeat the same process for the JBoss imagestreams in
/usr/share/openshift/examples/xpaas-streams/jboss-image-streams.json

Now, load the updated imagestream definitions:

[code]
# oc create -f /usr/share/openshift/examples/image-streams/image-streams-rhel7.json -n openshift
# oc create -f /usr/share/openshift/examples/xpaas-streams/jboss-image-streams.json -n openshift

Load the Docker Images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At this point the system has been prepared for loading the Docker images.
First, log in to the Docker registry using the token and registry service IP
obtained earlier:

[code]
# docker login -u adminuser -e mailto:adminuser@abc.com \
   -p $MYTOKEN $REGISTRY:5000

Next, push the Docker images:

[code]
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/amq-openshift
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/eap-openshift 
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/tomcat7-openshift
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/tomcat8-openshift
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/mongodb-26-rhel7
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/mysql-56-rhel7
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/perl-520-rhel7
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/php-56-rhel7
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/postgresql-94-rhel7
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/python-27-rhel7
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/python-34-rhel7
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/ruby-22-rhel7
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/nodejs-010-rhel7 

Verify the that all the imagestreams now have the tags populated and you will be good to go.

[code]
# oc get imagestreams -n openshift

As an example, one of the output should have tags as shown below

[code]
NAME                                 DOCKER REPO                                                      TAGS                                     UPDATED
jboss-amq-6                          registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-amq-6/amq-openshift             6.2-140,6.2-84,latest + 2 more...        10 days ago

The tags (6.2-140,6.2-84,latest + 2 more...) should not be empty.

Finishing Touches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this point the OpenShift environment is almost ready for use. It is likely
that you will want to install and configure a router, documented here:

https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/install_config/install/deploy_router.html
