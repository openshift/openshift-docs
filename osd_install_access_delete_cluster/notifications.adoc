Cluster service logs can be viewed through {cluster-manager-first} and {cluster-manager} CLI. The cluster history details cluster events such as adding groups, adding users, adding identity providers, load balancer quota updates, and scheduled maintenance upgrades.

In addition to the cluster history on {cluster-manager}, users subscribed to cluster notifications also receive emails for cluster upgrade maintenance, known cluster incidents, or customer action required cluster events.
