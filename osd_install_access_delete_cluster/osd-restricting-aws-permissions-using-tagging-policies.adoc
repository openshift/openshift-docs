A default `red-hat-managed=true` policy tag is applied to {product-title} IAM resources when they are created in AWS accounts. You can create tagging policies for this default tag to permit clusters and the Red Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team to manage only the resources required for your clusters.
