toc::[]

== Create a GitHub account
Before you can contribute to OpenShift documentation, you must
https://www.github.com/join[sign up for a GitHub account].

== Set up authentication
When you have your account set up, follow the instructions to
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/[generate and set up SSH
keys on GitHub] for proper authentication between your workstation and GitHub.

Confirm authentication is working correctly with the following command:

----
$ ssh -T git@github.com
----

== Fork and clone the OpenShift documentation repository
You must fork and set up the OpenShift documentation repository on your
workstation so that you can create PRs and contribute. These steps must only
be performed during initial setup.

. Fork the https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs repository into your
GitHub account from the GitHub UI. You can do this by clicking on *Fork* in the
upper right-hand corner.

. In the terminal on your workstation, change into the directory where you want
to clone the forked repository.

. Clone the forked repository onto your workstation with the following
command, replacing _<user_name>_ with your actual GitHub username.
+
----
$ git clone git@github.com:<user_name>/openshift-docs.git
----

. Change into the directory for the local repository you just cloned.
+
----
$ cd openshift-docs
----

. Add an upstream pointer back to the OpenShift's remote repository, in this
case _openshift-docs_.
+
----
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:openshift/openshift-docs.git
----

This ensures that you are tracking the remote repository to keep your local
repository in sync with it.

== About AsciiBinder and Container Image
When you have the documentation repository cloned and set up, you are ready to
install the software and tools you will use to create the content. All OpenShift
documentation is created in AsciiDoc, and is processed with https://github.com/redhataccess/ascii_binder[AsciiBinder],
which is an http://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor]-based docs management system.

Because the installation is different depending on the operating system, or
even between GNU/Linux distributions, we recommend new users to use a container image.
With a container we can use the same image on different systems with no changes
required and without change the internal system libraries.

=== What you require
The following are minimum requirements:

* A sh shell environment (Linux and macOS already have a sh shell,
on Windows you can use http://cygwin.com/[Cygwin] or https://gitforwindows.org/[Git BASH]
* A container engine like https://podman.io/[Podman] or https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Docker]
* http://www.git-scm.com/[Git]
* A web browser (Firefox, Chrome, or Safari)
* An editor that can strip trailing whitespace, such as
link:https://atom.io/[Atom].

=== Build the container image
With https://podman.io/[Podman] or https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Docker] installed,
from within the `openshift-docs` directory, you can execute the following command to build
the image, just replace the `podman` with the `docker` depending on what container engine
you have installed:

[source,terminal]
----
$ cd openshift-docs
$ podman build --tag ocp-docs .
----

== Building the collection
With the image of the previous steps built, you are ready to build the collection.

1. From the `openshift-docs` directory, run an initial build using a container based
on that image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman run -ti --rm -v $PWD:/opt/openshift-docs:z ocp-docs asciibinder build
----

2. Open the generated HTML file in your web browser. This will be located in the
`openshift-docs/_preview/<distro>/<branch>` directory, with the same path and
filename as the original `.adoc` file you edited, only it will be with the
`.html` extension.

=== Clean up
The `.gitignore` file is set up to prevent anything under the `_preview` and
`_package` directories from being committed. However, you can reset the
environment manually by running:
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman run -ti --rm -v $PWD:/opt/openshift-docs:z ocp-docs asciibinder clean
----

== Without a container image
The following instructions describe how to install all the required tools to do
live content editing on a Fedora Linux system without using a container image.

These are the commands that install the packages and the gems needed to build
and edit the documents:

[source,terminal]
----
$ dnf install -y rubygems ruby-devel make gcc-c++
$ gem install asciidoctor-diagram ascii_binder
----

[NOTE]
====
. On certain systems, the package manager installs an older version of RubyGems that can cause issues.
As an alternative, you can install RubyGems by using RVM. The following example is referenced 
from the link:https://rvm.io/rvm/install[RVM site]:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
----

. If you already have AsciiBinder installed, you might be due for an update.
These directions assume that you are using AsciiBinder 0.2.0 or newer. To check
and update if necessary, simply run `gem update ascii_binder`.
Note that you might require root permissions.

== Next steps
With the repository and tools set up on your workstation, you can now either
edit existing content or create assemblies and modules.

* link:doc_guidelines.adoc[Review the documentation guidelines] to understand
some basic guidelines to keep things consistent across our content.
* link:create_or_edit_content.adoc[Create a local working branch] on your
workstation to edit existing content or create content.
