toc::[]

== Create a GitHub account
Before you can contribute to OpenShift documentation, you must
https://www.github.com/join[sign up for a GitHub account].

== Set up authentication
When you have your account set up, follow the instructions to
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/[generate and set up SSH
keys on GitHub] for proper authentication between your workstation and GitHub.

Confirm authentication is working correctly with the following command:

----
$ ssh -T git@github.com
----

== Fork and clone the OpenShift documentation repository
You must fork and set up the OpenShift documentation repository on your
workstation so that you can create PRs and contribute. These steps only need to
be performed during initial setup.

1. Fork the https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs repository into your
GitHub account from the GitHub UI. You can do this by clicking on *Fork* in the
upper right-hand corner.

2. On your workstation, clone the forked repository on your workstation with the
following command. Be sure to change into the directory where you want to clone,
and replace _<user_name>_ with your actual GitHub username.
+
----
$ git clone git@github.com:user_name/openshift-docs.git
----

3. From your local repository you just cloned, add an upstream pointer back to
the OpenShift's remote repository, in this case _openshift-docs_.
+
----
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:openshift/openshift-docs.git
----

This ensures that you are tracking the remote repository to keep your local
repository in sync with it.

== Install AsciiBinder and dependencies
When you have the documentation repository cloned and set up, you are ready to
install the software and tools you will use to create the content. All OpenShift
documentation is created in AsciiDoc, and is processed with http://asciibinder.org[AsciiBinder],
which is an http://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor]-based docs management system.

You can work on a topic file in an editing environment that automatically
processes and updates the rendered HTML.

=== What you need
The following are minimum requirements to set up a live editing environment:

* A bash shell environment (Linux and OS X include a bash shell environment out
of the box, but if you are on Windows you can use http://cygwin.com/[Cygwin])
* https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/[Ruby]
* http://www.git-scm.com/[Git]
* A web browser (Firefox, Chrome, or Safari) with the
http://livereload.com/[LiveReload] extension installed

=== Install the required software dependencies on a Linux system
The following instructions describe how to install all the required tools to do
live content editing on a Fedora Linux system.

1. Install the _RubyGems_ package with `yum install rubygems`
2. Install _Ruby_ development packages with `yum install ruby-devel`
3. Install _gcc_ with `yum install gcc-c++`
4. Install _redhat-rpm-config_ with `yum install redhat-rpm-config`
5. Install the _ascii_binder_ gem with `gem install ascii_binder`

NOTE: If you already have AsciiBinder installed, you may be due for an update. These directions assume that you are using AsciiBinder 0.0.8 or newer. To check and update if necessary, simply run `gem update ascii_binder`. Note that you may need root permissions.

=== Initial setup
After you have confirmed that you meet the minimum system requirements, or if
you are on a Linux system you have installed the
link:#install-the-required-software-dependencies-on-a-linux-system[required
software dependencies], you can perform the initial setup.

[NOTE]
.ditaa Support
====
https://github.com/stathissideris/ditaa[ditaa] requires $JAVA_HOME be set, which requires a JDK
installed (try e.g. `yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel` and `export
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0`).
====

=== How to use LiveReload
With the initial setup complete, you are ready to use LiveReload to edit your
content.

1. From the `openshift-docs` directory, run an initial build:
+
----
$ cd openshift-docs
$ asciibinder build
----
2. Open the generated HTML file in your web browser. This will be located in the
`openshift-docs/_preview/<distro>/<branch>` directory, with the same path and
filename as the original `.adoc` file you edited, only it will be with the
`.html` extension.
3. Run the `watch` utility:
+
----
$ asciibinder watch
----
+
[TIP]
This utility will run in the terminal where you started it, so you should leave
it running and open new terminal windows for other tasks.

4. In your browser, enable the LiveReload plugin in the same tab where the
preview file is open; the icon should change color once activated. The following
message will also display in your terminal window:
+
----
[1] guard(main)> 17:29:22 - INFO - Browser connected.
----

With this setup, a rebuild is automatically generated each time you make a change
to the source `.adoc` file, and is immediately viewable in the corresponding
`.html` file.

=== Clean up
The `.gitignore` file is set up to prevent anything under the `_preview` and
`_package` directories from being committed. However, you can reset the
environment manually by running:

----
$ asciibinder clean
----

== Next steps
With the repository and tools set up on your workstation, you can now either
edit existing content or create new topics.

* link:doc_guidelines.adoc[Review the documentation guidelines] to understand
some basic guidelines to keep things consistent across our content.
* link:create_or_edit_content.adoc[Create a local working branch] on your
workstation to edit existing topics or create new topics.
