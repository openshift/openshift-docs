toc::[]

== Create a GitHub account
Before you can contribute to OpenShift documentation, you must
https://www.github.com/join[sign up for a GitHub account].

== Set up authentication
When you have your account set up, follow the instructions to
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/[generate and set up SSH
keys on GitHub] for proper authentication between your workstation and GitHub.

Confirm authentication is working correctly with the following command:

----
$ ssh -T git@github.com
----

== Fork and clone the OpenShift documentation repository
You must fork and set up the OpenShift documentation repository on your
workstation so that you can create PRs and contribute. These steps must only
be performed during initial setup.

. Fork the https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs repository into your
GitHub account from the GitHub UI. You can do this by clicking on *Fork* in the
upper right-hand corner.

. In the terminal on your workstation, change into the directory where you want
to clone the forked repository.

.  Clone the forked repository onto your workstation with the following
command, replacing _<user_name>_ with your actual GitHub username.
+
----
$ git clone git@github.com:<user_name>/openshift-docs.git
----

. Change into the directory for the local repository you just cloned.
+
----
$ cd openshift-docs
----

. Add an upstream pointer back to the OpenShift's remote repository, in this
case _openshift-docs_.
+
----
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:openshift/openshift-docs.git
----

This ensures that you are tracking the remote repository to keep your local
repository in sync with it.

== Install Podman or Docker and run AsciiBinder as a container image

When you have the documentation repository cloned and set up, you are ready to
install the software and tools you will use to create the content. All OpenShift
documentation is created in AsciiDoc, and is processed with https://github.com/redhataccess/ascii_binder[AsciiBinder],
which is an http://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor]-based docs management system.

The recommended way to run AsciiBinder is on a container image using Podman or Docker.

. Install the _docker_ or _link:https://podman.io/docs/installation[Podman]_ package.
. Change to the `openshift-docs` directory and build every distribution by entering the `run` command for the tool that you are using. The following example uses Docker and is identical for Podman on Linux. This example might require some setup on a Mac.
+
----
$ cd openshift-docs
$ docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`:/docs:Z quay.io/openshift-cs/asciibinder asciibinder build
----
. Open the generated HTML file in your web browser. This will be located in the
`openshift-docs/_preview/<distro>/<branch>` directory, with the same path and
filename as the original `.adoc` file you edited, but with an
`.html` extension.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Previously, installing AsciiBinder directly on your system was recommended. However, on recent Linux distribution releases, AsciiBinder does not work because of Ruby version incompatibility.

Use AsciiBinder by running the container image.

== Next steps
With the repository and tools set up on your workstation, you can now either
edit existing content or create assemblies and modules.

some basic guidelines to keep things consistent across our content.
* link:create_or_edit_content.adoc[Create a local working branch] on your
workstation to edit existing content or create content.
