:description: Create working branch to contribute new content or updates

toc::[]

== Before you begin
Before you proceed, we recommend that you have completed the following:

* Read and reviewed the link:contributing.adoc[Contribute to OpenShift
documentation] topic to understand some basics
* link:tools_and_setup.adoc[Installed and set up the tools and software]
required to contribute
* Read and reviewed the link:doc_guidelines.adoc[Documentation guidelines] topic
to understand the basic guidelines for consistency

== Ensure your local repository is in sync with the remote
Before you create a local working branch, it is good practice to ensure that
your local `master` branch is in sync with the remote and that you have all the
latest changes. You must also ensure that your forked repository is also in sync
with the remote repository.

1. From your local repository, make sure you have the `master` branch checked
out:
+
----
$ git checkout master
----

2. Fetch the current state of the OpenShift documentation repository:
+
----
$ git fetch upstream
----

3. Incorporate the commits from the remote repository, in this case
`openshift/openshift-docs`, into your local repository:
+
----
$ git rebase upstream/master
----

4. Push the latest updates to your forked repository so that it is also in sync
with the remote:
+
----
$ git push origin master
----

== Add new topics or update existing content on local branch
With your local and forked repositories in sync with the remote, you can now
create a local working branch where you will make all your updates, or create
any new content.

*Step 1:* Create local branch

The following command creates a new local branch from the branch that you are currently on, and checks it out
automatically. Be sure to replace `<working_branch>` with a suitable name.
Also, be sure that the changes made on this branch are closely related and
do indeed reflect that name.
In particular, it is a good idea to use separate PRs
for bugfix changes (for an old or current release)
vs enhancement changes (for an upcoming new release).

----
$ git checkout -b <working_branch>
----

[NOTE]
====
This command creates a new specified branch and also checks it out, so you will
automatically switch to the new branch.
====

*Step 2:* Create new content or update existing content as required

With the local branch created and checked out, you can now edit any content, or
start adding new content.

If you are creating a new topic, it is best to use the topic templates so that
all of the required metadata is included:

* For an Overview topic, use the
https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/blob/master/contributing_to_docs/templates/overview_topic_template.adoc[Overview
topic template].
* For all other topics, use the
https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/blob/master/contributing_to_docs/templates/topic_template.adoc[normal
topic template].

Otherwise, ensure that any new topic contains the required metadata as described
in the link:doc_guidelines.adoc[documentation guidelines] topic, including
naming and title conventions.

*Step 3:* Add all of your changes to a pending commit

When you are finished making all of your changes, and have tested the updated or
new content, the following command adds those changes to a pending commit:

----
$ git add .
----

*Step 4:* Commit your changes

After adding your changes to a pending commit, the following command commits
those changes locally:

----
$ git commit -am "Detailed comments about what changes were made; for example, fixed typo"
----

*Step 5:* Rebase updates from `master` into your working branch

If you fetched the latest changes from `master` before you created your local
branch, this step may not be necessary. However, it is good practice to fetch
the latest changes from `master` and rebase those onto your working branch.

Remember, that you should rebase against the branch that you created this working branch from. In most cases, it will be the master branch.

----
$ git rebase upstream/master
----

[NOTE]
====
If you find any conflicts you must fix those, and repeat steps 3 and 4.
====

*Step 6:* Push all changes to your GitHub account

After you have rebased, fixed any conflicts, and committed your changes, you can
push them to your GitHub account. This command adds your local working branch to
your GitHub repository:

----
$ git push origin <working_branch>
----

== Submit PR to merge your work
When you have pushed your changes to your GitHub account, you can submit a PR to
have your work from your GitHub fork to the `master` branch of the OpenShift
documentation repository. The documentation team will review the work, advise of
any further changes that may or may not be required, and finally merge your
work.

1. Go to your forked GitHub repository on the GitHub website, and you should see
your local branch that includes all of your work.
2. Click on *Pull Request* to submit the PR against the `master` branch of the
`openshift-docs` repository.
3. Attach labels to your *Pull Request* to indicate to the DOCS team which branches your PR might apply to. Some requests may only apply to the origin distro (origin-only), and some may only apply to a specific version of the enterprise (branch/enterprise-3.4, branch/enterprise-3.5, branch/enterprise-3.6) or dedicated (branch/dedicated) or online (branch/online) docs. If a request applies to multiple versions of a distro, then specify the minimum version (branch/enterprise-3.5 and above, for example). The docs team maintains these branches for all active and future distros and your PR will be applied to one or more these.

*If you don't have permissions to apply labels, please make sure to leave that information as a comment.*

== Confirm your changes have been merged
When your PR has been merged into the `master` branch, you should confirm and
then sync your local and GitHub repositories with the `master` branch.

1. On your workstation, switch to the `master` branch:
+
----
$ git checkout master
----

2. Pull the latest changes from `master`:
+
----
$ git fetch upstream
----

3. Incorporate the commits from the remote repository, in this case
`openshift/openshift-docs`, into your local repository:
+
----
$ git rebase upstream/master
----

4. After confirming in your rebased local repository that your changes have been
merged, push the latest changes, including your work, to your GitHub account:
+
----
$ git push origin master
----

== Add changes to an existing PR, if required
In some cases you might have to make changes to a PR that you have already
submitted. A PR can contain multiple commits, and we strive to preserve the
review history and all discussions that occur around those commits. The
following instructions describe how to make changes to an existing PR you have
already submitted.

1. Commit whatever updates you have made to the working branch by creating a new
commit:
+
----
$ git commit -am "Detailed message as noted earlier"
----

2. To keep the Git history clean, you may be asked to rebase your PR and squash
multiple commits into one commit. Before you push your changes in the next step,
follow the instructions here to rebase:
https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/How-to-Rebase-a-Pull-Request

3. After you have rebased, push the latest updates to the local working branch
to your GitHub account.
+
----
$ git push origin <working_branch> --force
----

The `--force` flag ignores whatever is on the remote server and replaces
everything with the local copy. You should now see the new commits in the
existing PR. Sometimes a refresh of your browser may be required.

== Delete the local working branch
When you have confirmed that all of your changes have been accepted and merged,
and you have pulled the latest changes on `master` and pushed them to your
GitHub account, you can delete the local working branch. Ensure you are in your
local repository before proceeding.

1. Delete the local working branch from your workstation.
+
----
$ git branch -D <working_branch>
----

2. Delete the working branch from your GitHub account:
+
----
$ git push origin :<working_branch>
----
