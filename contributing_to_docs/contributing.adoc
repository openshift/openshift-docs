== Different ways to contribute

There are a few different ways you can contribute to OpenShift documentation:

// * Submit comments at the bottom of each topic (still awaiting implementation)
* Email the OpenShift Docs team at openshift-docs@redhat.com.
* Create a link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/issues/new[GitHub], link:https://issues.redhat.com/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa[Jira], or link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=OpenShift%20Container%20Platform[Bugzilla] documentation ticket.
* Submit a pull request (PR). You can create a local clone of your own fork of the link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs[openshift-docs repository], make your changes, and submit a PR. This option is best if you have substantial changes. If you open a PR, be sure that all of its contents are related and apply to the same versions.

*What happens when you submit a PR?*

The following diagram outlines the OpenShift documentation contribution process:

image::osdocs-contribution-workflow.png[OpenShift documentation contribution workflow]

When you submit a PR, the https://github.com/orgs/openshift/teams/team-documentation[OpenShift Docs team] reviews the PR and arranges further reviews by Quality Engineering (QE), subject matter experts (SMEs), and others, as required. If the PR requires changes, updates, or corrections, the reviewers add comments in the PR. We might request that you make the changes, or let you know that we incorporated your content in a different PR. Occasionally, we might add commits to the original PR directly. When the PR has been reviewed, all updates are complete, and all commits are squashed, the documentation team merges the PR and applies it to the valid versions.

For a more detailed description of the contribution workflow, see link:create_or_edit_content.adoc#understanding-the-contribution-workflow[Understanding the contribution workflow].

== Repository organization
Each top directory in the OpenShift documentation repository can include a
collection of top level assemblies and subdirectories that contain more
assemblies. The exceptions to this rule are directories whose names
start with an underscore (like `_builder_lib` and `_javascripts`), which contain
the assets used to generate the finished documentation.

Each top level `<topic>` directory contains AsciiDoc assembly files, any `<subtopic>`
subdirectories, and symlinks to the `images` and `modules` directories that
contain all the images and modules for the collection.

== Version management
Most of the content applies to all five OpenShift products: OKD, OpenShift
Online, OpenShift Dedicated, ROSA and OpenShift Container Platform. While a large
amount of content is reused for all product collections, some information
applies to only specific collections. Content inclusion and exclusion is managed
on the assembly level by specifying distributions in the
`&#95;topic&#95;map.yml` files in the `&#95;topic&#95;maps` folder or by using `ifdef/endif` statements in individual
files.

////
While it is _possible_
to accomplish this solely with Git branches to maintain slightly different
versions of a given topic, doing so would make the task of maintaining internal
consistency extremely difficult for content contributors.

Git branching is still extremely valuable, and serves the important role of
tracking the release versions of documentation for the various OpenShift
products.
////

=== Conditional text between products
OpenShift documentation uses AsciiDoc's `ifdef/endif` macro to conditionalize
and reuse content across the different OpenShift products, down to the
single-line level.

The supported distribution attributes used with the OpenShift build mechanism
are:

* _openshift-origin_
* _openshift-online_
* _openshift-enterprise_
* _openshift-dedicated_
* _openshift-aro_
* _openshift-webscale_
* _openshift-rosa_

These attributes can be used by themselves or in conjunction to conditionalize
text within an assembly or module.

Here is an example of this concept in use:

----
This first line is unconditionalized, and will appear for all versions.

\ifdef::openshift-online[]
This line will only appear for OpenShift Online.
\endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise
This line will only appear for OpenShift Container Platform.
\endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise
This line will appear for OKD and OpenShift Container Platform, but not for OpenShift Online or OpenShift Dedicated.
\endif::[]
----

Note that the following limitation exists when conditionalizing text:

* While the `ifdef/endif` blocks have no size limit, do not use them to
to conditionalize an entire file. If an entire file is specific to a
only some OpenShift distributions, specify them in the `&#95;topic&#95;map.yml`
file.

== Release branches

With the combination of conditionalizing content within files with
`ifdef/endif` and conditionalizing whole files in the `&#95;topic&#95;map.yml`
file, the `main` branch of
this repository always contains a complete set of documentation for all
OpenShift products. However, when and as new versions of an OpenShift product
are released, the `main` branch is merged down to new or existing release
branches. Here is the general naming scheme used in the branches:

* `main` - This is our *working* branch.
* `enterprise-N.N` - OpenShift Container Platform support releases. The docs
for OpenShift Online and OpenShift Dedicated are based on the appropriate
`enterprise-N.N` branch.

On a 12-hourly basis, the documentation web sites are rebuilt for each of these
branches. This way the published content for each released version of an
OpenShift product will remain the same while development continues on the
`main` branch. Additionally, any corrections or additions that are
"cherry-picked" into the release branches will show up in the published
documentation after 12 hours.

[NOTE]
====
All OpenShift content development for the 4.x stream occurs on the `main`, or
 *working* branch.
Therefore, when submitting your work the PR must be created against the `main`
branch. After it is reviewed, a writer will apply the content to the relevant
release branches. If you know which branches a change applies to, be sure to
specify it in your PR.

When adding or updating content for version 3.11, you should create a feature
branch against enterprise-3.11 to submit your changes.
====

== Adding files to the collection
After you create assembly files, you must add them to the `&#95;topic&#95;map.yml` so
that the build system can render them. The documentation build system reads
the `&#95;distro&#95;map.yml` from the main branch to determine
which branches to build and then the `&#95;topic&#95;map.yml` file
for each of the branches
to construct the content from the source files and publish to the relevant
product site at https://docs.openshift.com. The build system _only_ reads this
file to determine which topic files to include. Therefore, all new assemblies that
are created must be included in the `&#95;topic&#95;map.yml` file in
order to be processed by the build system.

For all supported versions, the topic map files are available in the `&#95;topic&#95;maps` folder. Older versions support `&#95;topic&#95;map.yml` file in the root folder.

OpenShift Dedicated and OpenShift ROSA have their own topic maps: `&#95;topic&#95;map&#95;osd.yml` and `&#95;topic&#95;map&#95;rosa.yml`. Edits to these files should be coordinated with Service Delivery documentation team members as that team is primarily responsible for maintaining this content.

[NOTE]
====
Module files are included in the appropriate assembly files. Modules are not added directly to the `&#95;topic&#95;map.yml` file.
====

=== Topic map file format
For supported branches the `&#95;topic&#95;map.yml` is based in the `&#95;topic&#95;maps` folder in the root directory and are organized (primarily) by distributions.

The `&#95;topic&#95;map.yml` file uses the following format:

----
--- //<1>
Name: Origin of the Species <2>
Dir:  origin_of_the_species <3>
Distros: all <4>
Topics:
  - Name: The Majestic Marmoset <5>
    File: the_majestic_marmoset <6>
    Distros: all
  - Name: The Curious Crocodile
    File: the_curious_crocodile
    Distros: openshift-online,openshift-enterprise <4>
  - Name: The Numerous Nematodes
    Dir: the_numerous_nematodes <7>
    Topics:
      - Name: The Wily Worm <8>
        File: the_wily_worm
      - Name: The Acrobatic Ascarid  <= Sub-topic 2 name
        File: the_acrobatic_ascarid  <= Sub-topic 2 file under <group dir>/<subtopic dir>
----
<1> Record separator at the top of each topic group.
<2> Display name of topic group.
<3> Directory name of topic group.
<4> Which OpenShift versions this topic group is part of.
* The *Distros* setting is optional for topic groups and topic items. By
default, if the *Distros* setting is not used, it is processed as if it was set
to *Distros: all* for that particular topic or topic group. This means that
topic or topic group will appear in all product documentation versions.
* The *all* value for *Distros* is a synonym for
_openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise,openshift-online,openshift-dedicated,openshift-aro,openshift-webscale_.
* The *all* value overrides other values, so _openshift-online,all_ is processed
as *all*.
* Do not use _openshift-dedicated_ or _openshift-rosa_ in the main `&#95;topic&#95;map.yml` file. Use the distribution specific topic map file.
<5> Assembly name.
<6> Assembly file under the topic group dir without `.adoc`.
<7> This topic is actually a subtopic group. Instead of a `File` path it has a
`Dir` path and `Topics`, just like a top-level topic group.
<8> Assemblies belonging to a subtopic group are listed just like regular assemblies
with a `Name` and `File`.
