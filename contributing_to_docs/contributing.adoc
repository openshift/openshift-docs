[NOTE]
====
Are you contributing content for 4.x? If yes, please read how to https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/blob/master/contributing_to_docs/contributing_user_stories.adoc[contribute user stories].

== Different ways to contribute
There are a few different ways you can contribute to OpenShift documentation:

* Email the OpenShift documentation team openshift-docs@redhat.com
* https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/issues/new[Create an issue in
GitHub]
* If you would like to do the work yourself, or if it is a substantial change,
then you should clone the repository, make your changes, and submit a PR.
Each PR should have closely-related changes.
In particular, it is a good idea to use separate PRs
for bugfix changes (for an old or current release)
vs enhancement changes (for an upcoming new release). If you are submitting content for
OCP 4.x, please read how to https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/blob/master/contributing_to_docs/contributing_user_stories.adoc[contribute user stories].

*What happens when you submit a PR?*

If you make a substantial change and submit a PR in GitHub, your PR will be
reviewed by our
documentation team. Tag the team using @openshift/team-documentation as a comment to get their attention.
If there are any further changes, updates, or corrections required, we will
inform you in the PR. When the PR has been reviewed and all changes have been
accepted by our documentation team, your PR will be merged.

== Repository organization
Each top directory in the OpenShift documentation repository can include a
collection of top-level topics, and/or subdirectories that further contain a
second level of topics. The exceptions to this rule are directories whose names
start with an underscore (like `_builder_lib` and `_javascripts`), which contain
the assets used to generate the finished documentation.

Each top-level `<topic>` directory contains the topics as AsciiDoc files, any
`<subtopic>` subdirectories, and an `images` directory where all images for that
topic are stored.

/subtopic_dir1
/subtopic_dirN

/topic_dir/images/imgN.png
...

== Version management
Most of the content applies to all four OpenShift products: OKD, Online, Dedicated and
Enterprise (some versions of Enterprise), so approximately 80% of the content is reused. In many cases, this
means that individual topics may need to include or exclude individual
paragraphs with respect to a specific OpenShift product. While it is _possible_
to accomplish this solely with Git branches to maintain slightly different
versions of a given topic, doing so would make the task of maintaining internal
consistency extremely difficult for content contributors.

Git branching is still extremely valuable and serves the important role of
tracking the release versions of documentation for the various OpenShift
products.

=== Conditional text between products
OpenShift documentation uses AsciiDoc's `ifdef/endif` macro to conditionalize
and reuse content across the different OpenShift products, down to the
single-line level.

The supported distribution attributes used with the OpenShift build mechanism
are:

* _openshift-origin_
* _openshift-online_
* _openshift-enterprise_
* _openshift-dedicated_

These attributes can be used by themselves, or in conjunction to conditionalize
text within a topic document.

Here is an example of this concept in use:

----
This first line is unconditionalized, and will appear for all versions.

\ifdef::openshift-online[]
This line will only appear for OpenShift Online.
endif::[]

\ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
This line will only appear for OpenShift Enterprise.
endif::[]

\ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
This line will appear for OKD and Enterprise, but not for OpenShift Online or OpenShift Dedicated.
endif::[]
----

Note that the following limitations exist when conditionalizing text:

1. The `ifdef/endif` blocks have no size limit, however, they should not be used
to conditionalize an entire topic. If an entire topic file is specific to a
given OpenShift distribution, see the xref:how-it-all-comes-together[How it all
comes together] section for information on how to conditionalize whole topics
with the metadata `yaml` file.

2. Avoid using `ifndef/endif`. As of writing, it's use is broken and buggy.

== Release branches
With the combination of conditionalizing content within topics with
`ifdef/endif` and conditionalizing whole topics with the
xref:how-it-all-comes-together[metadata `yaml` file], the `master` branch of
this repository always contains a complete set of documentation for all five
OpenShift products. However, when and as new versions of an OpenShift product
are released, the `master` branch is merged down to new or existing release
branches. Here is the general naming scheme used in the branches:

* `master` - OKD latest code; essentially, this is our *working*
branch
* `enterprise-N.N` - OpenShift Enterprise support releases
* The `dedicated` and `online` branches are built using the enterprise version that they correspond to.

On a 6 hourly basis, the documentation websites are rebuilt for each of these
branches. This way the published content for each released version of an
OpenShift product will remain the same while development continues on the
`master` branch. Additionally, any corrections or additions that are
"cherry-picked" into the release branches will show up in the published
documentation after 6 hours.

[NOTE]
====
All OpenShift content development occurs on the `master`, or *working* branch.
Therefore, when submitting your work the PR must be created against the `master`
branch. Once it is reviewed that content will then migrate to the corresponding
release branches.

[[how-it-all-comes-together]]
== How it all comes together
The documentation build system reads the `&#95;distro&#95;map.yml` to figure out which branches to build and then the `&#95;topic&#95;map.yml` metadata file for each of the branches
to construct the content from the source files and publish to the relevant
product site at https://docs.openshift.com. The build system _only_ reads this
file to determine which topic files to include. Therefore, all new topics that
are created must be included in the `&#95;topic&#95;map.yml` metadata file in
order to be processed by the build system.

=== Metadata file format
The format of this file is as indicated:

----
--- //<1>
Name: Origin of the Species <2>
Dir:  origin_of_the_species <3>
Distros: all <4>
Topics:
  - Name: The Majestic Marmoset <5>
    File: the_majestic_marmoset <6>
    Distros: all
  - Name: The Curious Crocodile
    File: the_curious_crocodile
    Distros: openshift-online,openshift-enterprise <7>
  - Name: The Numerous Nematodes
    Dir: the_numerous_nematodes <8>
    Topics:
      - Name: The Wily Worm <9>
        File: the_wily_worm
      - Name: The Acrobatic Ascarid  <= Sub-topic 2 name
        File: the_acrobatic_ascarid  <= Sub-topic 2 file under <group dir>/<subtopic dir>
----
<1> Record separator at the top of each topic group
<2> Display name of topic group
<3> Directory name of topic group
<4> Which OpenShift versions this topic group is part of
<5> Topic name
<6> Topic file under the topic group dir without `.adoc`
<7> Which OpenShift versions this topic is part of
<8> This topic is actually a subtopic group. Instead of a `File` path it has a
`Dir` path and `Topics`, just like a top-level topic group.
<9> Topics belonging to a subtopic group are listed just like regular topics
with a `Name` and `File`.

****
Notes on *Distros* metadata attribute

* The *Distros* setting is optional for topic groups and topic items. By
default, if the *Distros* setting is not used, it is processed as if it was set
to *Distros: all* for that particular topic or topic group. This means that the
topic or topic group will appear in all five product documentation.
* The *all* value for *Distros* is a synonym for
_openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise,openshift-online,openshift-dedicated,openshift-aro_.
* The *all* value overrides other values, so _openshift-online,all_ is processed
as *all*.
