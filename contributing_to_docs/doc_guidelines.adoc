toc::[]

== Directory and file naming conventions

All topic directory groups and topic filenames must be lowercase, and must not include whitespace, in order for the build system work correctly. Refer to the following example:

....
/
/topic_dir
/topic_dir/topic_1.adoc
/topic_dir/topic_2.adoc
/topic_dir/topic_3.adoc
....

== Topic Files

Every topic file should contain the following metadata at the top, with no line spacing in between, except where noted:

----
= Document/Topic Title                                          <1>
{product-author}                                                <2>
{product-version}                                               <3>
:data-uri:                                                      <4>
:icons:                                                         <5>
:toc: macro                                                     <6>
:toc-title:                                                     <7>
:description: <Brief description of content for search>         <8>
-----------intentional blank line--------------
toc::[]                                                         <9>
----

<1> Human readable title of document/topic title line (notice the '=' top-level header)
<2> AsciiDoctor attribute for product author and gets dynamically replaced
<3> AsciiDoctor attribute for product version and gets dynamically replaced
<4> AsciiDoctor attribute to embed all images directly in the HTML
<5> AsciiDoctor attribute for icons used in admonitions and such (TIP, NOTE, WARNING, etc.)
<6> Adds a table of contents (TOC) with manual placement.
<7> Overrides the default title of TOC and removes the title.
<8> Brief description or synopsis of the document/topic to help with Google search.
<9> Placement of the TOC.

After the heading block and a single whitespace line, you can include any content for the topic.

[NOTE]
====
The topic title, which is the first line of the document, is the only level 1 ( = ) title. Section headers within the topic must be level 2 ( == ) or lower.
====

If using section anchors, they must be all lowercase letters, with no line spaces between the anchor and the section title:

----
[[section_anchor_name]]
=== Section Title
----

== Links, hyperlinks, and cross references

Whenever possible the link to another topic should be part of the actual sentence. Avoid creating links as a separate sentence that begins with "See [this topic] for more information on x". 

.Examples of recommended method of linking to other topics
----
Rollbacks revert part of an application back to a previous deployment. Rollbacks can be performed using the REST API or
the link:cli.html#deployment-rollbacks[OpenShift CLI].

Before you can create a domain, you must first link:applications.html#create_app[create an application].
----

This example renders like so:
====
Rollbacks revert part of an application back to a previous deployment. Rollbacks can be performed using the REST API or the link:cli.html#deployment-rollbacks[OpenShift CLI].

Before you can create a domain, you must first link:applications.html#create_app[create an application].
====

For comparison and clarification, the following example shows the previous method of linking to other topics.

.Example of old method of linking to other topics (not recommended)
----
Rollbacks revert an application back to a previous deployment and can be performed using the REST API or
the OpenShift CLI. See the link:cli.html#deployment-rollbacks[CLI documentation] for more information.

Before you can create a domain, you must first create an application. See link:applications.html#create_app[Create an Application]
for information on how to create an application.
----

This example renders like so:
====
Rollbacks revert an application back to a previous deployment and can be performed using the REST API or the OpenShift CLI. See the link:cli.html#deployment-rollbacks[CLI documentation] for more information.

Before you can create a domain, you must first create an application. See link:applications.html#create_app[Create an Application] for information on how to create an application.
====

The difference here is that in the first example the link to [create an application] is part of the actual sentence. In the second example, both links are sentences that begin with "See....", which is not recommended.

If you want to link to a different website, use:

----
http://othersite.com/otherpath[friendly descriptor]
----

TIP: If you want to build a link from a URL _without_ changing the text from the actual URL, just print the URL without adding a `[friendly text]` block at the end; it will automatically be rendered as a link.

If you want to link to another topic in the same topic group directory:

----
link:<filename>[friendly title]
----

Do not use the `.adoc` file extension. The document processor will correctly link this to the resulting HTML file.

There probably are two scenarios for linking to other content:

1. Link to another topic file that exists in a separate topic group, or directory.
2. Link to another topic file that exists in the same topic group, or directory.

The following examples use the example directory structure shown here:
....
/
/foo
/foo/bar.adoc
/baz
/baz/zig.adoc
/baz/zag.adoc
....

If you are working on `bar.adoc` and you want to link to `zig.adoc`, do it this way:

----
link:../baz/zig.html[see the ZIG manual for more]
----

[NOTE]
====
You must use the .html extension in order for the link to work correctly.
====

If you are working on `zig.adoc` and want to link to `zag.adoc`, do it this way:

----
link:zag.html[comment]
----

This type of linking should be sufficient in most cases. However, you can also link to a subtopic within a topic file:

----
link:../baz/zig/#subtopic
----

If you want to link to an image:

1. Put it in `<topic_dir>/images`
2. In the topic document, use this format to link to an image:

----
image:<name_of_image>[image]
----

You only need to specify `<name_of_image>`. The build mechanism automatically specifies the file path.

== Conditional text between products
OpenShift documentation uses the AsciiDoc `ifdef/endif` macro to conditionalize document segments for specific OpenShift distributions down to the single-line level.

The supported distribution attributes used with the OpenShift build mechanism are:

* _openshift-origin_
* _openshift-online_
* _openshift-enterprise_

These attributes can be used by themselves, or in conjunction to conditionalize text within a topic document.

Here is an example of this concept in use:

....
This first line is unconditionalized, and will appear for all versions.

ifdef::openshift-online[]
This line will only appear for OpenShift Online.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
This line will only appear for OpenShift Enterprise.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
This line will appear for OpenShift Origin and Enterprise, but not for OpenShift Online.
endif::[]
....


Note that the following limitations exist when conditionalizing text:

1. The `ifdef/endif` blocks have no size limit, however they should not be used to conditionalize an entire topic. If an entire topic file is specific to a given OpenShift distribution, refer to the Document Set Metadata section for information on how to conditionalize at the whole-topic level.

2. The `ifdef/endif` blocks cannot be nested. In other words, one conditional block cannot contain other conditional blocks.

== Formatting

For all of the system blocks including table delimiters, use four characters. For example:

....
|=== for tables
---- for code blocks
....

=== Code blocks

For all code blocks, you must include an empty line above a code block.

Acceptable:

....
Lorem ipsum

----
$ lorem.sh
----
....

Not acceptable:

....
Lorem ipsum
----
$ lorem.sh
----
....

Without the line spaces the content is likely to be not parsed correctly.

Also, if you want to render some code inline, use backticks:

....
"The file can be found at `/dev/null` on your host."
....

Which renders as:

"The file can be found at `/dev/null` on your host."

=== Lists
Lists are created as shown in this example:

....
. Item 1 (2 spaces between the period and the first character)

. Item 2

. Item 3
....

This will render as such:

. Item 1

. Item 2

. Item 3

If you need to add any text, admonitions, or code blocks you need to add the continuous +, as shown in the example:

....
. Item 1
+
----
some code block
----

. Item 2

. Item 3
....

This renders as shown:

. Item 1
+
----
some code block
----

. Item 2

. Item 3

=== Command syntax and examples
The main distinction between showing command syntax and example is that a command syntax should just show customers how to use the command, with replaceable parameters of that command. Whereas an example should show the command with actual values and the output of that command.

==== Command syntax
To markup command syntax, use the sidebar block with the [replaceable] markup and the required command parameters, as shown in the following example.

....
The following command returns a list of objects for the specified object type:

****
`osc get [replaceable]#<object_type> <object_id>#`
****
....

This would render as follows:

The following command returns a list of objects for the specified object type:

****
`osc get [replaceable]#<object_type> <object_id>#`
****

==== Examples
As mentioned an example of a command should use actual values and also show an output of the command, as shown in the following example. In some a heading may not be required.


....
In the following example the `osc get` operation returns a complete list of services that are currently defined.

.Example Title
