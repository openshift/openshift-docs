== Topic metadata
Every topic file should contain the following metadata at the top, with no line spacing in between, except where noted:

----
= Document/Topic Title                                          <1>
:data-uri:                                                      <2>
:icons:                                                         <3>

----

<1> Human readable title of document/topic title line (notice the '=' top-level header)
<2> AsciiDoctor attribute to embed all images directly in the HTML
<3> AsciiDoctor attribute for icons used in admonitions and such (TIP, NOTE, WARNING, etc.)
<4> Adds a table of contents (TOC) with manual placement.
<5> Overrides the default title of TOC and removes the title.
<6> Placement of the TOC.

After the heading block and a single whitespace line, you can include any content for the topic.

[NOTE]
====
The topic title, which is the first line of the document, is the only level 1 ( = ) title. Section headers within the topic must be level 2 ( == ) or lower.
====

If using section anchors, they must be all lowercase letters, with no line spaces between the anchor and the section title:

----
[[section-anchor-name]]
=== Section Title
----

== Titles, headings, and filenames
There are some general guidelines and conventions we follow for titles,
headings, and topic filenames. These are described in the following table.

[cols="4,5,8",options="header"]
|===

| |Example |Description

.^|Topic filenames
.^|manage_authorization_policies.adoc
|Try to shorten the topic filename as much as possible WITHOUT abbreviating
important terms that may cause confusion. In this example, this topic filename
would be appropriate for a topic titled Managing Authorization Policies.
.^|Topic / section titles
.^a|Managing Authorization Policies
a|- Use title case in all topic titles and section headings. See
http://titlecase.com/ for more information.
- Try to be as descriptive as possible with the topic title or section headings
without making them unnecessarily too long.
- The content in this repo is used to build docs that publish to multiple
locations (e.g., docs.openshift.com, docs.openshift.org, and the Red Hat
Customer Portal). While heading IDs will be created automatically from any
section titles (e.g., "Managing Authorization Policies" would generate an ID of
`managing-authorization-policies`, which would act as an anchor reference), we
should not rely on this automatic generation because the IDs need to be unique
across all topics in the repo. This is mainly to avoid build failures for the
Customer Portal docs, due to ID collision. Therefore, always add an ID manually,
and check the repo to make sure that it is unique and not already in use. Manual
IDs use the following syntax:
+
----
[[managing-authorization-policies]]
== Managing Authorization Policies
----
|===

== Product name & version attributes

When possible, generalize references to the product name and/or version using
the `{product-title}` and/or `{product-version}` attributes. These attributes
are pulled from distro mapping definitions in the
https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/blob/master/_distro_map.yml[distro_map.yml]
file.

The `{product-title}` comes from the first `name:` field in a distro mapping,
while the associated `{product-version}` comes from the `name:` fields on any
`branches:` defined.

How these attributes render is dependent on which distro and branch build you
are viewing. The following table shows the current slate of distros and the
possible values for `{product-title}` and `{product-version}`.

[options="header"]
|===
|Distro |`{product-title}` |`{product-version}`

|`openshift-origin`
|OpenShift Origin
|Latest

|`openshift-enterprise`
|OpenShift Enterprise
|3.1, 3.0

|`openshift-dedicated`
|OpenShift Dedicated
|3.1, 3.0

|`openshift-online`
|OpenShift Online
|Latest
|===

For example:

----
You can deploy applications on {product-title}.
----

This is a safe statement that could appear in probably any of the builds, so an
https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/blob/master/contributing_to_docs/contributing.html#conditional-text-between-products[ifdef/endif
statement] is not necessary. For example, if you were viewing a build for the
`openshift-enterprise` distro (for any of the distro-defined branches), this
would render as:

"You can deploy applications on OpenShift Enterprise."

And for the `openshift-origin` distro:

"You can deploy applications on OpenShift Origin."

Considering that we use distinct branches to keep content for product versions
separated, global use of `{product-version}` across all branches is probably
less useful, but it is available if you come across a need for it. Just consider
how it will render across any branches that the content appears in.

== Links, hyperlinks, and cross references
Links can be used to cross-reference internal topics, or send customers to external information resources for further reading.

=== Internal Cross-References
Whenever possible the link to another topic should be part of the actual sentence. Avoid creating links as a separate sentence that begins with "See [this topic] for more information on x".

[NOTE]
====
Use the relative file path (from the file you are editing, to the file you are linking to), even if you are linking to the same directory that you are writing in. This makes search and replace operations to fix broken links much easier.

For example, if you are writing in *_architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc_* and you want to link to *_architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc_* then you would need to include the path back to the first level of the topic directory:

----
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc
----
====

.Markup example of cross-referencing to internal topics
----
Rollbacks revert part of an application back to a previous deployment. Rollbacks can be performed using the REST API or
the xref:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.adoc#installing-the-cli[OpenShift CLI].

Before you can create a domain, you must first xref:../dev_guide/new_app.adoc[create an application].
----

.Rendered output of cross-referencing to internal topics:
====
Rollbacks revert part of an application back to a previous deployment. Rollbacks can be performed using the REST API or the xref:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#installing-the-cli[OpenShift CLI].

Before you can create a domain, you must first xref:../dev_guide/new_app.adoc[create an application].
====

For comparison and clarification, the following example shows the previous method of linking to other topics.
Do not use the old method of linking to internal topics, as shown in the following examples.

.Example of old method of linking to other topics (not recommended)
----
Rollbacks revert an application back to a previous deployment and can be performed using the REST API or
the OpenShift CLI. See the xref:cli.adoc#deployment-rollbacks[CLI documentation] for more information.

Before you can create a domain, you must first create an application. See xref:applications.adoc#create_app[Create an Application]
for information on how to create an application.
----

This example renders like so:
====
Rollbacks revert an application back to a previous deployment and can be performed using the REST API or the OpenShift CLI. See the xref:cli.html#deployment-rollbacks[CLI documentation] for more information.

Before you can create a domain, you must first create an application. See xref:applications.adoc#create_app[Create an Application] for information on how to create an application.
====

The difference here is that in the first example the link to [create an application] is part of the actual sentence. In the second example, both links are sentences that begin with "See....", which is not recommended.

=== Links to External Websites

If you want to link to a different website, use:

----
http://othersite.com/otherpath[friendly descriptor]
----

TIP: If you want to build a link from a URL _without_ changing the text from the actual URL, just print the URL without adding a `[friendly text]` block at the end; it will automatically be rendered as a link.

=== Links to Internal Topics
There probably are two scenarios for linking to other content:

1. Link to another topic file that exists in the same topic group, or directory.
2. Link to another topic file that exists in a separate topic group, or directory.

The following examples use the example directory structure shown here:
....
/
/foo
/foo/bar.adoc
/baz
/baz/zig.adoc
/baz/zag.adoc
....

*Link to topic in same topic group directory*

----
xref:<filename>[friendly title]
----

Use the `.adoc` file extension and the internal cross reference macro *xref*. The document processor will correctly link this to the resulting HTML file.

For example, using the above syntax, if you are working on `zig.adoc` and want to link to `zag.adoc`, do it this way:

----
xref:zag.adoc[comment]
----

*Link to topic in different topic group directory*

----
xref:../dir/<filename>.adoc[friendly title]
----

For example, if you are working on `bar.adoc` and you want to link to `zig.adoc`, do it this way:

----
xref:../baz/zig.adoc[see the ZIG manual for more]
----

[NOTE]
====
You must use the .adoc extension in order for the link to work correctly. Append *#* to the link reference even if there is no anchor specified.
====

*Link to a subtopic within a topic file*

To link to a subtopic within a topic file, use the following syntax:

----
xref:../baz/zig/#subtopic
----

== Sharing content between files

If you want to share content from one topic so that it appears in another topic,
you can use the `include` directive. See the Asciidoctor documentation for
details:

http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#include-partial

If you find that you need to include content from one topic multiple times into
another topic, see the following usage:

http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#include-multiple

== Images
If you want to link to an image:

1. Put it in `<topic_dir>/images`
2. In the topic document, use this format to link to an image:

----
image::<name_of_image>[image]
----

You only need to specify `<name_of_image>`. The build mechanism automatically specifies the file path.

=== AsciiDoctor diagram extension
AsciiDoctor provides a set of http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-diagram/[extensions to embed diagrams] written using http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/[PlantUML], http://www.graphviz.org/[Graphviz], http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/[ditaa], or https://github.com/christiangoltz/shaape[Shaape] syntax inside your AsciiDoc documents. The diagram extension generates an SVG, PNG, or TXT file from the source text. The image file that's generated then gets inserted into the rendered document.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The AsciiDoctor diagram extension serves a starting point for creating images in OpenShift documentation. In most cases these images will be professionally enhanced to meet our internal standards and guidelines.
====

See the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-diagram/[AsciiDoctor diagram extension] documentation for instructions on how to install and use it.


We will mostly use the `ditaa` block in OpenShift documentation. The `png` file from the `ditaa` block is generated in the same directory as the source file with a checksum as the filename. However, you can specify the path of the generated `png` file with the second attribute in the `ditaa` block.

For example, in our case we would want our images in the *topic_dir/_images_* folder of the main topic directory:

----
....
[ditaa, "images/name_of_image"]
....
----

== Formatting

For all of the system blocks including table delimiters, use four characters. For example:

....
|=== for tables
---- for code blocks
....

=== Code blocks
Code blocks are used to show examples of command screen outputs, or configuration files. When using command blocks always use the actual values for any items that a user would normally replace. Code blocks should represent exactly what a customer would see on their screen. If you need to expand or provide information on what some of the contents of a screen output or configuration file represent, then use callouts to provide that information.

Follow these general guidelines when using code blocks:

* Do NOT show replaceables within code blocks.

* Do NOT use any markup in code blocks; code blocks generally do not accept any markup

* Try to use callouts to provide information on what the output represents when required

For all code blocks, you must include an empty line above a code block.

Acceptable:

....
Lorem ipsum

----
$ lorem.sh
----
....

Not acceptable:

....
Lorem ipsum
----
$ lorem.sh
----
....

Without the line spaces the content is likely to be not parsed correctly.

=== Inline Code or Commands
Do NOT show full commands or command syntax inline within a sentence. The next section covers how to show commands and command syntax.

Only use case for inline commands would be general commands and operations, without replaceables and command options. In this case an inline command is marked up using the back ticks:

....
Use the `GET` operation to do x.
....

This renders as:

Use the `GET` operation to do x.

=== Command syntax and examples
The main distinction between showing command syntax and example is that a command syntax should just show customers how to use the command without real values. An example on the other hand should show the command with actual values with an example output of that command, where applicable.

==== Command syntax
To markup command syntax, use the code block and wrap the replaceables in <> with the required command parameters, as shown in the following example. Do NOT use commands or command syntax inline with sentences.

....
The following command returns a list of objects for the specified object type:

----
oc get <object_type> <object_id>
----
....

This would render as follows:

The following command returns a list of objects for the specified object type:

----
oc get <object_type> <object_id>
----

==== Examples
As mentioned an example of a command should use actual values and also show an output of the command, as shown in the following example. In some a heading may not be required.


....
In the following example the `oc get` operation returns a complete list of services that are currently defined.

.Example Title
====

----
$ oc get se

....

This would render as shown:

In the following example the `oc get` operation returns a complete list of services that are currently defined.

.Example Title

----
====

=== Lists
Lists are created as shown in this example:

....
. Item 1 (2 spaces between the period and the first character)

. Item 2

. Item 3
....

This will render as such:

. Item 1

. Item 2

. Item 3

If you need to add any text, admonitions, or code blocks you need to add the continuous +, as shown in the example:

....
. Item 1
+
----
some code block
----

. Item 2

. Item 3
....

This renders as shown:

. Item 1
+
----
some code block
----

. Item 2

. Item 3
