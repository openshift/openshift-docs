toc::[]

== General file guidelines

* Set your editor to strip trailing whitespace.

== Assembly file metadata
Every assembly file should contain the following metadata at the top, with no line
spacing in between, except where noted:

----
[id="<unique-heading-for-assembly>"]                            <1>
= Assembly title                                                <2>
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]                       <3>
:context: <unique-context-for-assembly>                         <4>
----

<1> A unique (within OpenShift docs) anchor id for this assembly. Example: cli-developer-commands
<2> Human readable title (notice the '=' top-level header)
<3> Includes all attributes common to OpenShift docs
<4> Context used for identifying headers in modules that is the same as the anchor id. Example: cli-developer-commands.

After the heading block and a single whitespace line, you can include any content for this assembly.

[NOTE]
====
The assembly title, which is the first line of the document, is the only level 1 ( = ) title.
Section headers within the assembly must be level 2 ( == ) or lower. When you include modules, you must add
leveloffsets in the include statements. You can manually add more level 2 or lower section headers in the assembly.
====

== Module file metadata
Every module should be placed in the modules folder and should contain the following metadata at the top:

----
// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * list of assemblies where this module is included              <1>

[id="<module-anchor>_{context}"]                                   <2>
= Module title                                                     <3>
----

<1> List of assemblies in which this module is included.
<2> A module anchor with {context} that must match the module's file name.
<3> Human readable title. To ensure consistency in the results of the
leveloffset values in include statements, you must use a level one heading
( = ) for the module title.

Example:

----
// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * cli_reference/openshift_cli/developer-cli-commands.adoc

[id="cli-basic-commands_{context}"]
= Basic CLI commands
----

*All headings after the initial title must have a section anchor, with no line spaces between the
anchor and the section title and the anchor id should be similar to the section title*:

----
[id="<section-anchor>_{context}"]
=== Section title
----

== Assembly/module file names

Try to shorten the file name as much as possible _without_ abbreviating
important terms that may cause confusion. For example, the
`managing-authorization-policies.adoc` file name would be appropriate for an
assembly titled "Managing Authorization Policies".

== Directory names

If you create a directory with a multiple-word name, separate each word with an
underscore, for example `backup_and_restore`. Do not create a top-level directory
in the repository without checking with the docs team. In the main OpenShift
docs, you can create one level of subdirectories. In the docs for features that
are designed to be used with OpenShift, such as Service Mesh and OpenShift virtualization,
you can create two levels of subdirectories.

== Assembly/Module titles and section headings

Use sentence case in all titles and section headings. See http://www.titlecase.com/ or
https://convertcase.net/ for a conversion tool.

Try to be as descriptive as possible with the title or section headings
without making them unnecessarily too long. For assemblies and task modules,
use a gerund form in headings, such as:

* Creating
* Managing
* Using

Do not use "Overview" as a heading.

=== Discrete headings

If you have a section heading that you do not want to appear in the TOC
(like if you think that some section is not worth showing up or if there are already
too many nested levels), you can use a discrete (or floating) heading:

http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#discrete-or-floating-section-titles

A discrete heading also will not get a section number in the Customer Portal
build of the doc. Previously, we would use plain bold mark-up around a heading
like this, but discrete headings also allow you to ignore section nesting rules
(like jumping from a `==` section level to a `====` level if you wanted for some
style reason).

To use a discrete heading, just add `[discrete]` to the line before your unique
ID. For example:

----
[discrete]
[id="managing-authorization-policies_{context}"]
== Managing authorization policies
----

== Writing assemblies
An _assembly_ is a collection of modules that describes how to accomplish a user story.

For more information about forming assemblies, see the
link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#forming-assemblies[Red Hat modular docs reference guide] and the link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs/master/modular-docs-manual/files/TEMPLATE_ASSEMBLY_a-collection-of-modules.adoc[assembly template].

[NOTE]
====
For `Prerequisites`, `Next steps`, and `Additional resources` headings, use `==` formatting in assembly files. Do not use `.Prerequisites`, `.Next steps`, or `.Additional information`, as this syntax should only be used within module files to suppress TOC formatting.
====

== Writing concepts
A _concept_ contains information to support the tasks that users want to do and
must not include task information like commands or numbered steps. In most
cases, create your concepts as individual modules and include them in
appropriate assemblies.

Avoid using gerunds in concept titles. "About <concept>"
is a common concept module title.

For more information about creating concept modules, see the
link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#creating-concept-modules[Red Hat modular docs reference guide] and the link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs/master/modular-docs-manual/files/TEMPLATE_CONCEPT_concept-explanation.adoc[concept template].

== Writing procedures
A _procedure_ contains the steps that users follow to complete a process or task. Procedures contain ordered steps and explicit commands. In most cases, create your procedures as individual modules and include them in appropriate assemblies.

Use a gerund in the procedure title, such as "Creating".

For more information about writing procedures, see the
link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#creating-procedure-modules[Red Hat modular docs reference guide] and the link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs/master/modular-docs-manual/files/TEMPLATE_PROCEDURE_doing-one-procedure.adoc[procedure template].

[NOTE]
====
When needed, use `.Prerequisites`, `.Next steps`, or `.Additional information` syntax to suppress TOC formatting within a module. Do not use `==` headings or xrefs in modules.
====

== Product name & version

When possible, generalize references to the product name and/or version using
the `{product-title}` and/or `{product-version}` attributes. These attributes
are pulled from distro mapping definitions in the
https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/blob/master/_distro_map.yml[distro_map.yml]
file.

The `{product-title}` comes from the first `name:` field in a distro mapping,
while the associated `{product-version}` comes from the `name:` fields on any
`branches:` defined.

How these attributes render is dependent on which distro and branch build you
are viewing. The following table shows the current distros and the
possible values for `{product-title}` and `{product-version}`.

[options="header"]
|===
|Distro |`{product-title}` |`{product-version}`

|`openshift-origin`
|OKD
|1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, Latest

|`openshift-enterprise`
|OpenShift Container Platform
|3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6

|`openshift-dedicated`
|OpenShift Dedicated
|Latest

|`openshift-online`
|OpenShift Online
|Latest
|===

For example:

----
You can deploy applications on {product-title}.
----

This is a safe statement that could appear in probably any of the builds, so an
https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/blob/master/contributing_to_docs/contributing.adoc#conditional-text-between-products[ifdef/endif
statement] is not necessary. For example, if you were viewing a build for the
`openshift-enterprise` distro (for any of the distro-defined branches), this
would render as:

> You can deploy applications on OpenShift Container Platform.

And for the `openshift-origin` distro:

> You can deploy applications on OKD.

Considering that we use distinct branches to keep content for product versions
separated, global use of `{product-version}` across all branches is probably
less useful, but it is available if you come across a requirement for it. Just consider
how it will render across any branches that the content appears in.

If it makes more sense in context to refer to the major version of the product
instead of a specific minor version (for example, if comparing how something in
OpenShift Container Platform 4 differs from OpenShift Container Platform 3),
just use the major version number. Do not prepend with a `v`, as in `v3` or `v4`.

Do not use markup in headings.

*Do not use internal company server names in command or example output*. See
suggested host name examples
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install/example_inventories.html#multi-masters-single-etcd-using-native-ha[here].


== Links, hyperlinks, and cross references
Links can be used to cross-reference internal assemblies or send readers to external information resources for further reading.

In OpenShift docs:

* All links to internal content is created using `xref` and **must have an anchor ID**.
* Only use `xref` in assemblies, not modules.
* All links to external websites are created using `link`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not split link paths across lines when wrapping text. This will cause issues with the doc builds.
====

=== Example URLs
To provide an example URL path that you do not want to render as a hyperlink, use this format:

....
`\https://www.example.com`
....

=== Internal cross-references
Whenever possible the link to another assembly should be part of the actual sentence.
Avoid creating links as a separate sentence that begins with "See [this assembly] for more information on x".

[NOTE]
====
Use the relative file path (from the file you are editing, to the file you are linking to),
even if you are linking to the same directory that you are writing in. This makes search and replace
operations to fix broken links much easier.

For example, if you are writing in *_architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc_* and you want to
link to *_architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc_* then you must include the path back to the first
level of the assembly directory:

----
xref:../../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-routes
----
====

.Markup example of cross-referencing
----
Rollbacks revert part of an application back to a previous deployment. Rollbacks can be performed using the REST API or
the xref:../cli_reference/openshift_cli/get_started_cli.adoc#installing-the-cli[OpenShift CLI].

Before you can create a domain, you must first xref:../dev_guide/application_lifecycle/new_app.adoc#dev-guide-new-app[create an application].
----

.Rendered output of cross-referencing
> Rollbacks revert part of an application back to a previous deployment. Rollbacks can be performed using the REST API or the xref:../cli_reference/openshift_cli/get_started_cli.adoc#installing-the-cli[OpenShift CLI].
>
> Before you can create a domain, you must first xref:../dev_guide/application_lifecycle/new_app.adoc#dev-guide-new-app[create an application].

=== Links to external websites

If you want to link to a different website, use:

----
link:http://othersite.com/otherpath[friendly reference text]
----

IMPORTANT: You must use `link:` before the start of the URL.

IMPORTANT: You cannot link to a repository that is hosted on www.github.com.

TIP: If you want to build a link from a URL _without_ changing the text from the actual URL, just print the URL without adding a `[friendly text]` block at the end; it will automatically be rendered as a link.

=== Links to internal content
There are two scenarios for linking to other assemblies:

1. Link to another file that exists in the same directory.
2. Link to another file that exists in a separate directory.

The following examples use the example directory structure shown here:
....
/
/foo
/foo/bar.adoc
/baz
/baz/zig.adoc
/baz/zag.adoc
....

*Link to assembly in same directory*

----
xref:<filename>#anchor-id[friendly title]
----

You must use the `.adoc` file extension. The document processor will correctly link this to the resulting HTML file.

For example, using the above syntax, if you are working on `zig.adoc` and want to link to `zag.adoc`, do it this way:

----
xref:../zag.adoc#baz-zag[comment]
----

where `baz-zag` is the anchor ID at the top of the file `zag.adoc`.

*Link to assembly in different directory*

----
xref:../dir/<filename>.adoc#anchor-id[friendly title]
----

For example, if you are working on `bar.adoc` and you want to link to `zig.adoc`, do it this way:

----
xref:../baz/zig.adoc#baz-zig[see the ZIG manual for more]
----

[NOTE]
====
You must use the .adoc extension in order for the link to work correctly and you must specify an anchor ID.
====

== Embedding an external file

You can embed content hosted outside the link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs[openshift-docs]
GitHub repository by using the `include` directive to target the URI of a raw
file. This is helpful for cases where content frequently changes; you embed the raw
file and the content auto-updates based on the changes made to the content on its
host site.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You are restricted to only embed files from GitHub repositories managed by the
`openshift` GitHub user. You must also prefix your external file URI with `https`.
URIs beginning with `http` are forbidden for security reasons and will fail the
documentation build.
====

For example, if you want to embed the link:https://github.com/openshift/installer/blob/release-4.6/upi/azure/01_vnet.json[01_vnet.json] template, include the URI of its raw file version like this:

```
.`01_vnet.json` ARM template
[source,json]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.6/upi/azure/01_vnet.json[]
----
```

[NOTE]
====
Embedding external files is restricted for files that change frequently, like templates. You must ensure that embedded files are QE verified before they are updated on their host site.
====

[NOTE]
====
You must get approval from the Engineering, QE, and Docs teams before embedding an external file.
====

== Indicating Technology Preview features

To indicate that a feature is in Technology Preview, include the
`modules/technology-preview.adoc` file in the feature's assembly to keep the
supportability wording consistent across Technology Preview features and provide a value for the :FeatureName: variable before you include this module.

See
link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/pull/13878/files#diff-615ba1bf3b09d11a9c2604b775aa32f2[an
example] of how this is applied.


== Images

=== Block images

To include a block image (an image on its own line):

1. Put the image file in the symlinked `images` folder.
2. In the `.adoc` content, use this format to link to the image:
+
----
image::<image_filename>[<alt_text>]
----
+
Note the double `::` instead of a single `:`, as seen in inline image usage.
You only have to specify `<image_filename>` itself and not the full file path;
the build mechanism automatically expands this appropriately.

=== Inline images (icons)

Inline images can be used to indicate graphic items in the web console, such as
buttons or menu icons.

====  Inserting reusable images inline

To simplify reuse, the following common SVGs (the OpenShift web console uses the
Font Awesome icon set) have already been added to the `images` folder with a
user-defined entity added to the `common-attributes.adoc` module:

|===
|Icon |Entity |Alt text |File name

|Kebab
|`:kebab:`
|Options menu
|`ellipsis-v.svg`

|===

When using inline, include the image after the UI element name. For example:

----
Click the *Options* menu {kebab}.
----

==== Inserting images inline without reuse

If you are inserting an image that is not part of the `common-attributes.adoc`
module, then include the image using this formatting:

----
image:<image_filename>[title="<alt_text>"]
----

Note the single `:` instead of a double `::`, as seen in block image usage.

For example:

----
image:manage-columns.png[title="Manage Columns icon"]
----

== Formatting

For all of the system blocks including table delimiters, use four characters. For example:

....
|=== for tables
---- for code blocks
....

=== Code blocks, command syntax, and example output

Code blocks are generally used to show examples of command syntax, example
screen output, and configuration files.

The main distinction between showing command syntax and a command example is
that a command syntax shows readers how to use the command without real values.
An example command, however, shows the command with actual values with an
example output of that command, where applicable.

For example:

....
In the following example, the `oc get` operation returns a complete list of services that are currently defined:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get se
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                LABELS                                    SELECTOR            IP                  PORT
kubernetes          component=apiserver,provider=kubernetes   <none>              172.30.17.96        443
kubernetes-ro       component=apiserver,provider=kubernetes   <none>              172.30.17.77        80
docker-registry     <none>                                    name=registrypod    172.30.17.158       5001
----
....

This renders as:

> In the following example, the `oc get` operation returns a complete list of services that are currently defined:
>
> ----
> $ oc get se
> ----
>
> .Example output
> ----
> NAME                LABELS                                    SELECTOR            IP                  PORT
> kubernetes          component=apiserver,provider=kubernetes   <none>              172.30.17.96        443
> kubernetes-ro       component=apiserver,provider=kubernetes   <none>              172.30.17.77        80
> docker-registry     <none>                                    name=registrypod    172.30.17.158       5001
> ----

The following guidelines go into more detail about specific requirements and
recommendations when using code blocks:

* Do NOT use any markup in code blocks; code blocks generally do not accept any markup.

* For all code blocks, you must include an empty line above a code block (unless
that line is introducing block metadata, such as `[source,terminal]` for syntax
highlighting).
+
Acceptable:
+
....
Lorem ipsum

----
$ lorem.sh
----
....
+
Not acceptable:
+
....
Lorem ipsum
----
$ lorem.sh
----
....
+
Without the line spaces, the content is likely to be not parsed correctly.

* Use `[source,terminal]` for `oc` commands or any terminal commands to enable
syntax highlighting. Any `[source]` metadata must go on the line directly before
the code block. For example:
+
....
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----
....
+
If you are also showing a code block for the output of the command, use
`[source,terminal]` for that code block as well.

* Use source tags for the programming language used in the code block to enable
syntax highlighting. For example:

** `[source,yaml]`
** `[source,go]`
** `[source,javascript]`

* Do not use more than one command per code block. For example, the following must
be split up into three separate code blocks:
+
....
Run the following commands to create templates you can modify:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm create-login-template > login.html
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm create-provider-selection-template > providers.html
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm create-error-template > errors.html
----
....

* Separate a command and its related example output into individual code blocks.
This allows the command to be easily copied using the button on
+++docs.openshift.com+++.
+
In addition, prepend the code block for the output with the title `.Example output`
to make it consistently clear across the docs when this is being represented. A
lead-in sentence explaining the example output is optional. For example:
+
....
Use the `oc new-project` command to create a new project:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project my-project
----

The output verifies that a new project was created:

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Now using project "my-project" on server "https://openshift.example.com:6443".
----
....

* To mark up command syntax, use the code block and wrap any replaceable values in
angle brackets (`<>`) with the required command parameter, using underscores
(`_`) between words as necessary for legibility. For example:
+
....
The following command returns a list of objects for the specified object type:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get <object_type> <object_id>
----
....
+
This renders as:
+
--
> The following command returns a list of objects for the specified object type:
>
> ----
> $ oc get <object_type> <object_id>
> ----
--
+
NOTE: Avoid using full command syntax inline with sentences.

* If you must provide additional information on what a line of a code block
represents, use callouts (`<1>`, `<2>`, etc.) to provide that information.
+
Use this format when embedding callouts into the code block:
+
[subs=-callouts]
....
----
code example 1 <1>
code example 2 <2>
----
<1> A note about the first example value.
<2> A note about the second example value.
....

* For long lines of code that you want to break up among multiple lines, use a
backslash to show the line break. For example:
+
----
$ oc get endpoints --all-namespaces --template \
    '{{ range .items }}{{ .metadata.namespace }}:{{ .metadata.name }} \
    {{ range .subsets }}{{ range .addresses }}{{ .ip }} \
    {{ end }}{{ end }}{{ "\n" }}{{ end }}' | awk '/ 172\.30\./ { print $1 }'
----

* If the user must run a command as root, use a number sign (`#`) at the start of the command instead of a dollar sign (`$`). For example:
+
----
# subscription-manager list
----

* For snippets or sections of a larger file, use an ellipsis (`...`) to show that
the file continues before and/or after the quoted block:
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    test: liveness
...
----
+
or
+
----
...
spec:
  containers:
  - args:
    image: k8s.gcr.io/liveness
...
----
+
Do not use `[...]`, `<snip>`, or any other variant.

=== Inline code or commands
Do NOT show full commands or command syntax inline within a sentence. The next section covers how to show commands and command syntax.

Only use case for inline commands would be general commands and operations, without replaceables and command options. In this case an inline command is marked up using the back ticks:

....
Use the `GET` operation to do x.
....

This renders as:

> Use the `GET` operation to do x.

=== Lists
Lists are created as shown in this example:

....
. Item 1 (2 spaces between the period and the first character)

. Item 2

. Item 3
....

This renders as:

> . Item 1
> . Item 2
> . Item 3

If you must add any text, admonitions, or code blocks you have to add the continuous +, as shown in the example:

....
. Item 1
+
----
some code block
----

. Item 2

. Item 3
....

This renders as:

> . Item 1
> +
> ----
> some code block
> ----
> . Item 2
> . Item 3

=== Footnotes

Avoid footnotes when possible.

If you reference a footnote from only a single location, use the following syntax:

.Footnote
....
footnote:[This is the footnote text.]
....

If you reference a footnote from multiple locations, set an attribute with the footnote text. As a consequence, this will duplicate the footnote text at bottom of the page.

.Footnote with text set by an attribute
....
:note-text: This is a footnote.

This text has a footnote qualifier attached footnote:[{note-text}].

But this other text uses the same qualifier elsewhere footnote:[{note-text}].
....

Avoid using `footnoteref`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `footnoteref` directive is deprecated in asciidoctor and causes a build warning when `ascii_binder` is run.
====

.Footnote with reference
....
footnoteref:[ref-string, This is the footnote text.]
....

==== Alternative footnote styling in tables

For footnotes in tables, use the following syntax to mimic Asciidoctor's
styling:

....
[cols="3",options="header"]
|===
|Header 1
|Header 2
|Header 3

|Item A ^[1]^
|Item B
|Item C ^[2]^

|Item D
|Item E ^[3]^
|Item F ^[3]^
|===
[.small]
--
1. A description.
2. Another description.
3. Two items relate to this description.
--
....

The notes are kept immediately after the table, instead of moved to the bottom
of the rendered assembly. This manual method also allows you to reuse the same
footnote number for multiple references as needed.

Note the following:

* Add a space before the superscripted numbers with square brackets.
* To match the table cell's font size, start the ordered list with a `[.small]`
style and wrap it in a `--` block.

=== Quick reference

.User accounts and info
[option="header"]
|===
|Markup in command syntax |Description |Substitute value in Example block

|`<username>`
|Name of user account
|user@example.com

|`<password>`
|User password
|password
|===

.Projects and applications
[option="header"]
|===
|Markup in command syntax |Description |Substitute value in Example block

|`<project>`
|Name of project
|myproject

|`<app>`
|Name of an application
|myapp
|===

== Admonitions
Admonitions such as notes and warnings are formatted as shown:

....
[ADMONITION]
====
Text for admonition
====
....

[id="api-object-formatting"]
== API object formatting

Use initial capitalization and upper camel case
(link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case#Variations_and_synonyms[PascalCase])
for Kubernetes/OpenShift API objects and do not mark them up unless referring to
a specific field or variable name from a spec or manifest.

This matches general Kubernetes usage and makes it obvious that a specific
concept is being referred to. For example:

- Pod
- Deployment
- Operator
- DaemonSet (not "daemon set", "daemonset", "daemonSet", or "Daemonset")

[id="operator-name-capitalization"]
==== Operator name capitalization

An Operator's full name must be a proper noun, with each word initially
capitalized. If it includes a product name, defer the product's capitalization
style guidelines. For example:

- Cluster Logging Operator
- Prometheus Operator
- etcd Operator
- Node Tuning Operator
- Cluster Version Operator

|Footnotes

|A footnote is created with the footnote macro. If you plan to reference a footnote more than once, use the ID footnoteref macro. The Customer Portal does not support spaces in the footnoteref. For example, "dynamic PV" should be "dynamicPV".

|See link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#user-footnotes[Footnotes] for the footnote and footnoteref syntax.
