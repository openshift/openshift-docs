:description: These are basic guidelines for creating technical documentation for OpenShift.

toc::[]

== Directory and file naming conventions

All topic directory groups and topic filenames must be lowercase, and must not include whitespace, in order for the build system work correctly. Refer to the following example:

....
/
/topic_dir
/topic_dir/topic_1.adoc
/topic_dir/topic_2.adoc
/topic_dir/topic_3.adoc
....

== Topic Files

Every topic file should contain the following metadata at the top, with no line spacing in between, except where noted:

----
= Document/Topic Title                                          <1>
{product-author}                                                <2>
{product-version}                                               <3>
:data-uri:                                                      <4>
:icons:                                                         <5>
:toc: macro                                                     <6>
:toc-title:                                                     <7>
:description: <Brief description of content for search>         <8>
-----------intentional blank line--------------
toc::[]                                                         <9>
----

<1> Human readable title of document/topic title line (notice the '=' top-level header)
<2> AsciiDoctor attribute for product author and gets dynamically replaced
<3> AsciiDoctor attribute for product version and gets dynamically replaced
<4> AsciiDoctor attribute to embed all images directly in the HTML
<5> AsciiDoctor attribute for icons used in admonitions and such (TIP, NOTE, WARNING, etc.)
<6> Adds a table of contents (TOC) with manual placement.
<7> Overrides the default title of TOC and removes the title.
<8> Brief description or synopsis of the document/topic to help with Google search.
<9> Placement of the TOC.

After the heading block and a single whitespace line, you can include any content for the topic.

[NOTE]
====
The topic title, which is the first line of the document, is the only level 1 ( = ) title. Section headers within the topic must be level 2 ( == ) or lower.
====

If using section anchors, they must be all lowercase letters, with no line spaces between the anchor and the section title:

----
[[section_anchor_name]]
=== Section Title
----

== Links, hyperlinks, and cross references
Links can be used to cross-reference internal topics, or send customers to external information resources for further reading. 

=== Internal Cross-References
Whenever possible the link to another topic should be part of the actual sentence. Avoid creating links as a separate sentence that begins with "See [this topic] for more information on x".

.Markup example of cross-referencing to internal topics
----
Rollbacks revert part of an application back to a previous deployment. Rollbacks can be performed using the REST API or
the link:cli.html#deployment-rollbacks[OpenShift CLI].

Before you can create a domain, you must first link:applications.html#create_app[create an application].
----

.Rendered output of cross-referencing to internal topics:
====
Rollbacks revert part of an application back to a previous deployment. Rollbacks can be performed using the REST API or the link:cli.html#deployment-rollbacks[OpenShift CLI].

Before you can create a domain, you must first link:applications.html#create_app[create an application].
====

For comparison and clarification, the following example shows the previous method of linking to other topics.
Do not use the old method of linking to internal topics, as shown in the following examples.

.Example of old method of linking to other topics (not recommended)
----
Rollbacks revert an application back to a previous deployment and can be performed using the REST API or
the OpenShift CLI. See the link:cli.html#deployment-rollbacks[CLI documentation] for more information.

Before you can create a domain, you must first create an application. See link:applications.html#create_app[Create an Application]
for information on how to create an application.
----

This example renders like so:
====
Rollbacks revert an application back to a previous deployment and can be performed using the REST API or the OpenShift CLI. See the link:cli.html#deployment-rollbacks[CLI documentation] for more information.

Before you can create a domain, you must first create an application. See link:applications.html#create_app[Create an Application] for information on how to create an application.
====

The difference here is that in the first example the link to [create an application] is part of the actual sentence. In the second example, both links are sentences that begin with "See....", which is not recommended.

=== Links to External Websites

If you want to link to a different website, use:

----
http://othersite.com/otherpath[friendly descriptor]
----

TIP: If you want to build a link from a URL _without_ changing the text from the actual URL, just print the URL without adding a `[friendly text]` block at the end; it will automatically be rendered as a link.

=== Links to Internal Topics
There probably are two scenarios for linking to other content:

1. Link to another topic file that exists in the same topic group, or directory.
2. Link to another topic file that exists in a separate topic group, or directory.

The following examples use the example directory structure shown here:
....
/
/foo
/foo/bar.adoc
/baz
/baz/zig.adoc
/baz/zag.adoc
....

*Link to topic in same topic group directory*

----
link:<filename>[friendly title]
----

Do not use the `.adoc` file extension. The document processor will correctly link this to the resulting HTML file.

For example, using the above syntax, if you are working on `zig.adoc` and want to link to `zag.adoc`, do it this way:

----
link:zag.html[comment]
----

*Link to topic in different topic group directory*

----
link:../dir/<filename>.html[friendly title]
----

For example, if you are working on `bar.adoc` and you want to link to `zig.adoc`, do it this way:

----
link:../baz/zig.html[see the ZIG manual for more]
----

[NOTE]
====
You must use the .html extension in order for the link to work correctly.
====

*Link to a subtopic within a topic file*

To link to a subtopic within a topic file, use the following syntax: 

----
link:../baz/zig/#subtopic
----

*Link to an image*


If you want to link to an image:

1. Put it in `<topic_dir>/images`
2. In the topic document, use this format to link to an image:

----
image:<name_of_image>[image]
----

You only need to specify `<name_of_image>`. The build mechanism automatically specifies the file path.

== Conditional text between products
OpenShift documentation uses the AsciiDoc `ifdef/endif` macro to conditionalize document segments for specific OpenShift distributions down to the single-line level.

The supported distribution attributes used with the OpenShift build mechanism are:

* _openshift-origin_
* _openshift-online_
* _openshift-enterprise_

These attributes can be used by themselves, or in conjunction to conditionalize text within a topic document.

Here is an example of this concept in use:

....
This first line is unconditionalized, and will appear for all versions.

ifdef::openshift-online[]
This line will only appear for OpenShift Online.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
This line will only appear for OpenShift Enterprise.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
This line will appear for OpenShift Origin and Enterprise, but not for OpenShift Online.
endif::[]
....


Note that the following limitations exist when conditionalizing text:

1. The `ifdef/endif` blocks have no size limit, however they should not be used to conditionalize an entire topic. If an entire topic file is specific to a given OpenShift distribution, refer to the Document Set Metadata section for information on how to conditionalize at the whole-topic level.

2. The `ifdef/endif` blocks cannot be nested. In other words, one conditional block cannot contain other conditional blocks.

== Formatting

For all of the system blocks including table delimiters, use four characters. For example:

....
|=== for tables
---- for code blocks
....

=== Code blocks
Code blocks are used to show examples of command screen outputs, or configuration files. When using command blocks always use the actual values for any items that a user would normally replace. Code blocks should represent exactly what a customer would see on their screen. If you need to expand or provide information on what some of the contents of a screen output or configuration file represent, then use callouts to provide that information.

Follow these general guidelines when using code blocks:

* Do NOT show replaceables within code blocks.

* Do NOT use any markup in code blocks; code blocks generally do not accept any markup

* Try to use callouts to provide information on what the output represents when required

For all code blocks, you must include an empty line above a code block.

Acceptable:

....
Lorem ipsum

----
$ lorem.sh
----
....

Not acceptable:

....
Lorem ipsum
----
$ lorem.sh
----
....

Without the line spaces the content is likely to be not parsed correctly.

=== Inline Code or Commands
Do NOT show full commands or command syntax inline within a sentence. See <<Command syntax and examples>> for information on how to show commands and command syntax.

Only use case for inline commands would be general commands and operations, without replaceables and command options. In this case an inline command is marked up using the back ticks:

....
Use the `GET` operation to do x.
....

This renders as:

Use the `GET` operation to do x.

=== Command syntax and examples
The main distinction between showing command syntax and example is that a command syntax should just show customers how to use the command without real values. An example on the other hand should show the command with actual values with an actual output of that command, where applicable.

==== Command syntax
To markup command syntax, use the sidebar block with the <replaceable> markup and the required command parameters, as shown in the following example. Do NOT use commands or command syntax inline with sentences.

....
The following command returns a list of objects for the specified object type:

****
`osc get _<object_type>_ _<object_id>_`
****
....

This would render as follows:

The following command returns a list of objects for the specified object type:

****
`osc get _<object_type>_ _<object_id>_`
****

==== Examples
As mentioned an example of a command should use actual values and also show an output of the command, as shown in the following example. In some a heading may not be required.


....
In the following example the `osc get` operation returns a complete list of services that are currently defined.

.Example Title
====

----
$ osc get se
NAME                LABELS                                    SELECTOR            IP                  PORT
kubernetes          component=apiserver,provider=kubernetes   <none>              172.30.17.96        443
kubernetes-ro       component=apiserver,provider=kubernetes   <none>              172.30.17.77        80
docker-registry     <none>                                    name=registrypod    172.30.17.158       5001
----

....

This would render as shown:

In the following example the `osc get` operation returns a complete list of services that are currently defined.

----
====

=== Lists
Lists are created as shown in this example:

....
. Item 1 (2 spaces between the period and the first character)

. Item 2

. Item 3
....

This will render as such:

. Item 1

. Item 2

. Item 3

If you need to add any text, admonitions, or code blocks you need to add the continuous +, as shown in the example:

....
. Item 1
+
----
some code block
----

. Item 2

. Item 3
....

This renders as shown:

. Item 1
+
----
some code block
----

. Item 2

. Item 3
