This topic describes basic guidelines and how to refer to the various components of OpenShift in our documentation. The goal is to standardize terminology across OpenShift content and be consistent in the usage of our terminology when referring to OpenShift components or architecture.

[NOTE]

If you want to add terms or other content to this document, or if anything needs to be fixed, please send an email to openshift-docs@redhat.com, or submit a PR on GitHub.

== Usage of OpenShift Terms

=== action

Usage: action

Authorization determines whether an _identity_ is allowed to perform any action. It consists of _project_, _verb_, and _resource_.

Action consists of the following:

* *Project* being accessed
* *Verb* is a get, list, create, or update operation
* *Resource* is the API endpoint being accessed. This is distinct from the resource being touched, such as pods, deployment configs, builds, etc..

''''
=== application

Usage: _application(s)_ as appropriate; italicized

Although the term _application_ is no longer an official noun in OpenShift, customers still create and host applications on OpenShift, and using the term within certain contexts is acceptable. For example, it may be a combination of one image, a git repo, or a replication controller, and this _application_ component can be PHP, MySQL, Ruby, JBoss, or something else.

Another example is that _projects_ can run _applications_ but the components that make up that _application_ are defined by the user.

Do *NOT* use the term _application_ in a topic or section heading.

*Examples of correct usage*
====
_OpenShift runs your applications_.

_The new-app command creates a new application from the components you specify._

_My application has two Ruby web services connected to a database backend and a RabbitMQ message queue, as well as a python worker framework._

_You can check the health of your application by adding probes to the various parts._

_Hosting a WordPress application on OpenShift._

=== authorization

Usage: authorization

An authorization determines whether an _identity_ is allowed to perform any action. It consists of _project_, _verb_, and _resource_.

''''

=== build 

Usage: build(s) as appropriate

''''

=== container

Usage: container(s) as appropriate

''''

=== container group

Usage: container group

''''

=== deployment

Usage: deployment

A deployment is a statement of intent by a user to roll out a new version of a config.  A replication controller can be used for that and other purposes. All deployments are replication controllers, but all replication controllers are not deployments.

''''
=== Dockerfile
Usage: Dockerfile; wrapped with [filename] markup. See link:doc_guidelines.html[Documentation Guidelines] for markup information.

Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands you would normally execute manually in order to build a Docker image.

Source: https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/

.Examples of correct usage
====
Open the [filename]#Dockerfile# and make the following changes.

Create a [filename]#Dockerfile# at the root of your repository.

''''
=== identity

Usage: image(s)

Both the username and list of groups the user belongs to.

''''
=== image

Usage: image(s)

''''

=== Kubelet

Usage: Kubelet(s)

Kubelets act as agents to control Kubernetes nodes.  They handle starting/stopping containers on a node, based on the desired state defined by the master.

''''

=== Kubernetes master

Usage: Kubernetes master

This component is responsible for managing the state of the system, ensuring that all containers expected to be running are actually running, and that other requests like builds and deployments are serviced.

''''

=== minion

Usage: minion(s) as appropriate

''''

=== namespace

Usage: namespace

''''

=== OpenShift CLI

Usage: OpenShift CLI

This is the command line interface of OpenShift v3, previously referred to as the client tools in OpenShift v2.

''''

=== OpenShift master

Usage: OpenShift master

OpenShift provides a REST endpoint for interacting with the system.  New deployments/configurations are created with the REST API and the state of the system can be interrogated through this endpoint as well.

''''

=== pod

Usage: pod(s) as appropriate

Kubernetes object that groups related Docker containers that need to share network, filesystem or memory together for placement on a node.  Multiple instances of a Pod can run to provide scaling and redundancy.

''''

=== project

Usage: project

''''

=== replication controller

Usage: replication controller

Kubernetes object that ensures N (as specified by the user) instances of a given Pod are running at all times.

''''
=== Source-to-Image (STI)

Usage: Source-to-Image for the first time reference; STI thereafter
