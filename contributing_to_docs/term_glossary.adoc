== Usage of OpenShift terms

This topic provides guidelines for referring to the various components of
OpenShift 4 and objects of a running OpenShift system in our documentation. The
goal is to standardize terminology across OpenShift content and be consistent in
the usage of our terminology when referring to OpenShift components or
architecture.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to add terms or other content to this document, or if anything must
be fixed, send an email to openshift-docs@redhat.com or submit a PR
on GitHub.
====

== A

''''
=== action

Usage: action

An action consists of _project_, _verb_, and _resource_:

* *Project* is the project containing the resource that is to be acted upon.
* *Verb* is a get, list, create, or update operation.
* *Resource* is the API endpoint being accessed. This is distinct from the
referenced resource itself, which can be a Pod, DeploymentConfig, Build, etc.

''''
=== apiserver

Usage: apiserver(s) or API server(s) as appropriate

A REST API endpoint for interacting with the system. New deployments and
configurations can be created with this endpoint, and the state of the system
can be interrogated through this endpoint as well.

''''
=== app

Usage: app(s)

Acceptable when referring to a mobile or web xref:application[application].

''''
[id="application"]
=== application

Usage: application(s)

Although the term application is no longer an official noun in OpenShift,
customers still create and host applications on OpenShift, and using the term
within certain contexts is acceptable. For example, the term application might
refer to some combination of an image, a Git repository, or a replication
controller, and this application might be running PHP, MySQL, Ruby, JBoss, or
something else.

*Examples of correct usage*
====
_OpenShift runs your applications_.

_The `new-app` command creates a new application from the components you specify._

_My application has two Ruby web Services connected to a database back end and a RabbitMQ message queue, as well as a python worker framework._

_You can check the health of your application by adding probes to the various parts._

_You can host a WordPress application on OpenShift._
====

''''
=== authorization

Usage: authorization

An authorization determines whether an _identity_ is allowed to perform any
action. It consists of _identity_ and _action_.

== B

''''
=== Build

Usage: Build(s) as appropriate

See link:doc_guidelines.adoc#api-object-formatting[API Object Formatting].

== C

''''
=== cluster

Usage: cluster

The collection of controllers, Pods, and Services and related DNS and networking
routing configuration that are defined on the system.

''''
=== ConfigMap

Usage: ConfigMap(s)

ConfigMaps hold configuration data for Pods to consume.

Do not use: configuration map(s)

''''
=== container

Usage: container(s)

''''
=== containerize

Usage: containerize(d)

Use "containerized" as an adjective when referring to applications made up of
multiple services that are distributed in containers. "Containerized" can be
used interchangeably with "container-based."

''''
=== container group

Usage: container group

== D

''''
=== Deployment

Usage: Deployment(s)

Kubernetes-native objects that provide declarative updates for Pods and
ReplicaSets.

Do not confuse with DeploymentConfigs, which predate Deployments.

To avoid further confusion, do not refer to an overall OpenShift installation /
instance / cluster as an "OpenShift deployment".

See link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/[Deployments - Kubernetes].
See link:doc_guidelines.adoc#api-object-formatting[API Object Formatting].

=== DeploymentConfig

Usage: DeploymentConfig(s)

OpenShift-specific objects that define the template for a Pod and manage
deploying new images or configuration changes. Uses ReplicationControllers.

Do not confuse with the Kubernetes native object Deployment, which were
introduced later and use ReplicaSets.

Do not use: deployment configuration(s)

''''
=== Dockerfile

Usage: Dockerfile; wrapped with [filename] markup. See
link:doc_guidelines.adoc[Documentation Guidelines] for markup information.

Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a
Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands you
would normally execute manually in order to build a Docker image.

Source: https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/

.Examples of correct usage
====
Open the [filename]#Dockerfile# and make the following changes.

Create a [filename]#Dockerfile# at the root of your repository.
====

== I

''''
=== identity

Usage: identity or identities as appropriate

Both the username and list of groups the user belongs to.

''''
=== image

Usage: image(s)

''''
=== Ignition config

Usage: Ignition config file or Ignition config files

The file that Ignition uses to configure Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS during
operating system initialization. The installation program generates different
Ignition config files to initialize bootstrap, master, and worker nodes.

=== Ingress

Usage: Ingress

API object that allows developers to expose Services through an HTTP(S) aware
load balancing and proxy layer via a public DNS entry. The Ingress resource may
further specify TLS options and a certificate, or specify a public CNAME that
the OpenShift Ingress Controller should also accept for HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
An administrator typically configures their Ingress Controller to be visible
outside the cluster firewall, and may also add additional security, caching, or
traffic controls on the Service content.

=== Ingress Controller

Usage: Ingress Controller(s)

A resource that forwards traffic to endpoints of Services. The Ingress Controller
replaces router from {product-title} 3 and earlier.

== K

''''
=== kubelet

Usage: kubelet(s) as appropriate

The agent that controls a Kubernetes node.  Each node runs a kubelet, which
handles starting and stopping containers on a node, based on the desired state
defined by the master.

''''
=== Kubernetes master

Usage: Kubernetes master(s) as appropriate

The Kubernetes-native equivalent to the link:#project[OpenShift master].
An OpenShift system runs OpenShift masters, not Kubernetes masters, and
an OpenShift master provides a superset of the functionality of a Kubernetes
master, so it is generally preferred to use the term OpenShift master.

== M

''''
=== minion

Usage: Deprecated. Use link:#node[node] instead.

== N

''''
=== node

Usage: node(s) as appropriate

A
http://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#node[node]
provides the runtime environments for containers.

''''
=== namespace

Usage: namespace

Typically synonymous with link:#project[project] in OpenShift parlance, which is
preferred.

== O

''''
=== OpenShift

Usage: OpenShift Container Platform, OpenShift Online, OpenShift Dedicated,
OpenShift Container Engine

The OpenShift product name should be paired with its product distribution /
variant name whenever possible. Previously, the upstream distribution was called
OpenShift Origin, however it is now called OKD; use of the OpenShift Origin name
is deprecated.

Avoid using the name "OpenShift" on its own when referring to something that
applies to all distributions, as OKD does not have OpenShift in its name.
However, the following components currently use "OpenShift" in the name and are
allowed for use across all distribution documentation:

- OpenShift Pipeline
- OpenShift SDN
- OpenShift Ansible Broker (deprecated in 4.2 / removed in 4.4)

''''
=== OpenShift CLI

Usage: OpenShift CLI (`oc`)

The `oc` tool is the command line interface of OpenShift 3 and 4.

When referencing as a prerequisite for a procedure module, use the following
construction: Install the OpenShift Command-line Interface (CLI), commonly known
as `oc`.

When referencing in overview text, use: OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

''''
=== OpenShift master

Usage: OpenShift master(s) as appropriate

Provides a REST endpoint for interacting with the system and manages the state
of the system, ensuring that all containers expected to be running are actually
running and that other requests such as builds and deployments are serviced.
New deployments and configurations are created with the REST API, and the state
of the system can be interrogated through this endpoint as well.  An OpenShift
master comprises the apiserver, scheduler, and SkyDNS.

''''
=== Operator

Usage: Operator(s)

An Operator is a method of packaging, deploying and managing a Kubernetes
application. A Kubernetes application is an application that is both deployed on
a Kubernetes cluster (including OpenShift clusters) and managed using the
Kubernetes APIs and `kubectl` or `oc` tooling.

While "containerized" is allowed, do not use "Operatorize" to refer to building an
Operator that packages an application.

.Examples of correct usage
====
Install the etcd Operator.

Build an Operator using the Operator SDK.
====

See link:doc_guidelines.adoc#api-object-formatting[API Object Formatting] for
more on Operator naming.

''''
=== Options menu

Usage: Options menu; use sparingly; not to be confused with Actions menu, which
signifies a specific menu seen in the web console.

This describes a menu type commonly called a "kebab", "hamburger", or "overflow"
menu that does not have hover text or a given name or label in the web console.

''''

== P

''''
=== Pod

Usage: Pod(s) as appropriate

Kubernetes object that groups related Docker containers that have to share
network, filesystem, or memory together for placement on a node. Multiple
instances of a Pod can run to provide scaling and redundancy.

See link:doc_guidelines.adoc#api-object-formatting[API Object Formatting].

''''
=== project

Usage: project(s)

A project allows a community of users to organize and manage their content in
isolation from other communities. It is an extension of the namespace object
from Kubernetes.

Even though projects are an OpenShift API object, it is not capitalized, much
like namespace is not capitalized.

== R

''''
=== ReplicaSet

Usage: ReplicaSet(s)

Similar to a ReplicationController, a ReplicaSet is a native Kubernetes API
object that ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given
time. Used by Deployments.

Do not use: replica set(s)

See link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/[ReplicaSet - Kubernetes].

''''
=== ReplicationController

Usage: ReplicationController(s)

Kubernetes object that ensures N (as specified by the user) instances of a given
Pod are running at all times. Used by DeploymentConfigs.

Do not use: replication controller(s)

''''
=== Route

Usage: Route(s)

OpenShift-specific API object that allows developers to expose Services through
an HTTP(S) aware load balancing and proxy layer via a public DNS entry. The
route may further specify TLS options and a certificate, or specify a public
CNAME that the OpenShift Ingress Controller should also accept for HTTP and
HTTPS traffic. An administrator typically configures their Ingress Controller to
be visible outside the cluster firewall, and may also add additional security,
caching, or traffic controls on the Service content.

== S

''''
=== scheduler

Usage: scheduler(s) as appropriate

Component of the Kubernetes master or OpenShift master that manages the state of
the system, places Pods on nodes, and ensures that all containers that are
expected to be running are actually running.

''''
=== secret

Usage: secret(s)

Kubernetes API object that holds secret data of a certain type.

See link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/[Secrets - Kubernetes].

''''
=== Service

Usage: Service(s)

Kubernetes native API object that serves as an internal load balancer. It
identifies a set of replicated Pods in order to proxy the connections it
receives to them. Backing Pods can be added to or removed from a Service
arbitrarily while the Service remains consistently available, enabling anything
that depends on the Service to refer to it at a consistent address.

A Service is a named abstraction of software service (for example, `mysql`)
consisting of local port (for example `3306`) that the proxy listens on, and the
selector that determines which Pods will answer requests sent through the proxy.

Capitalize when referring to the Kubernetes object specifically.

Do not confuse with link:https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/[Open Service Broker API related objects].
See
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/architecture/service_catalog/index.html#service-catalog-concepts-terminology[Service Catalog Concepts and Terminology].

''''
=== service account

Usage: service account(s)

A service account binds together:

* a name, understood by users, and perhaps by peripheral systems, for an identity
* a principal that can be authenticated and authorized
* a set of secrets

''''
=== SkyDNS

Usage: SkyDNS

Component of the Kubernetes master or OpenShift master that provides
cluster-wide DNS resolution of internal host names for Services and Pods.

''''
=== Source-to-Image (S2I)

Usage: Source-to-Image for the first time reference; S2I thereafter.

Deprecated abbreviation (do not use): STI

''''
=== spec

Usage: spec(s)

In addition to "spec file" being allowed related to RPM spec files, general
usage of "spec" is allowed when describing Kubernetes or OpenShift object specs
/ manifests / definitions.

*Examples of correct usage*
====
Update the Pod spec to reflect the changes.
====

''''
=== StorageClass

Usage: StorageClass(es)

Kubernetes API object that describes the parameters for a class of storage for
which PersistentVolumes can be dynamically provisioned. StorageClasses are
non-namespaced; the name of the StorageClass according to etcd is in
ObjectMeta.Name.

See link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/[Storage Classes - Kubernetes].
