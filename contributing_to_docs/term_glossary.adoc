== Usage of OpenShift terms

This topic provides guidelines for referring to the various components of
OpenShift 4 and objects of a running OpenShift system in our documentation. The
goal is to standardize terminology across OpenShift content and be consistent in
the usage of our terminology when referring to OpenShift components or
architecture.

For terms that are also API objects, there is different guidance for general usage of the term versus referencing the actual API object. This glossary mainly defines the general usage guideline (lowercase, separating words), but be sure to use the object formatting (PascalCase, in monospace) when referring to the actual object. See link:doc_guidelines.adoc#api-object-formatting[API object formatting] for more information.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to add terms or other content to this document, or if anything must
be fixed, send an email to openshift-docs@redhat.com or submit a PR
on GitHub.
====

== A

''''
=== action

Usage: action

An action consists of _project_, _verb_, and _resource_:

* *Project* is the project containing the resource that is to be acted upon.
* *Verb* is a get, list, create, or update operation.
* *Resource* is the API endpoint being accessed. This is distinct from the
referenced resource itself, which can be a pod, deployment, build, etc.

''''
=== API server

Usage: API server(s)

A REST API endpoint for interacting with the system. New deployments and
configurations can be created with this endpoint, and the state of the system
can be interrogated through this endpoint as well.

''''
=== API service

Usage: API service(s)

When referencing the actual object, write as `APIService`. See link:doc_guidelines.adoc#api-object-formatting[API object formatting] for more details.

''''
=== app

Usage: app(s)

Acceptable when referring to a mobile or web xref:application[application].

''''
[id="application"]
=== application

Usage: application(s)

Although the term application is no longer an official noun in OpenShift,
customers still create and host applications on OpenShift, and using the term
within certain contexts is acceptable. For example, the term application might
refer to some combination of an image, a Git repository, or a replication
controller, and this application might be running PHP, MySQL, Ruby, JBoss, or
something else.

.Examples of correct usage
====
OpenShift runs your applications.

The `new-app` command creates a new application from the components you specify.

My application has two Ruby web services connected to a database back end and a RabbitMQ message queue, as well as a python worker framework.

You can check the health of your application by adding probes to the various parts.

You can host a WordPress application on OpenShift.

An authorization determines whether an _identity_ is allowed to perform any
action. It consists of _identity_ and _action_.

== B

''''
=== boot image

Usage: boot image(s)

* A boot image is a disk image that contains a bootable operating system (OS) and all the configuration settings for the OS, such as drivers.

''''
=== build

Usage: build(s), or when speaking generally about `Build` objects.

* A build is the process of transforming input parameters into a resulting object.
* A `Build` object encapsulates the inputs needed to produce a new deployable image, as well as the status of the execution and a reference to the pod that executed the build.

When referencing the actual object, write as "``Build`` object" as appropriate. See link:doc_guidelines.adoc#api-object-formatting[API object formatting] for more details.

''''
=== build configuration

Usage: build configuration(s) when speaking generally about `BuildConfig` objects.

A `BuildConfig` object is the definition of the entire build process. A build configuration describes a single build definition and a set of triggers for when a new build is created.

When referencing the actual object, write as "``BuildConfig`` object" as appropriate. See link:doc_guidelines.adoc#api-object-formatting[API object formatting] for more details.

''''
=== cluster

Usage: cluster

The collection of controllers, pods, and services and related DNS and networking
routing configuration that are defined on the system.

''''
=== cluster service version

Usage: cluster service version

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), part of the Operator Framework, uses a cluster service version (CSV) to define the metadata that accompanies an Operator container image and assist in running the Operator in a cluster. This metadata is defined in a `ClusterServiceVersion` API object used to populate user interfaces with information such as its logo, description, and version. It is also a source of technical information that is required to run the Operator, like the RBAC rules it requires and which custom resources (CRs) it manages or depends on.

This is commonly abbreviated as a CSV.

''''
=== config map

Usage: config map(s)

Config maps hold configuration data for pods to consume.

When referencing the actual object, write as `ConfigMap`. See link:doc_guidelines.adoc#api-object-formatting[API object formatting] for more details.

multiple services that are distributed in containers. "Containerized" can be
used interchangeably with "container-based."

''''
=== container group

Usage: container group

''''
=== control plane

Usage: control plane

The control plane, which is composed of control plane machines, manages the {product-title} cluster. The control plane machines manage workloads on the compute machines, which are also known as worker machines.

Note that the OpenShift "control plane" was previously known as "master" and could still be in the code.

''''
=== custom resource

Usage: custom resource (CR)

A resource implemented through the Kubernetes `CustomResourceDefinition` API. A custom resource is distinct from the built-in Kubernetes resources, such as the pod and service resources. Every CR is part of an API group.

* A `Deployment` is a Kubernetes-native object that provides declarative updates for pods and
replica sets.
* A `DeploymentConfig` is an OpenShift-specific object that defines the template for a pod and manages
deploying new images or configuration changes. Uses replication controllers. Predates Kubernetes `Deployment` objects.

When referencing the actual object, write as `Deployment` or `DeploymentConfig` as appropriate. See link:doc_guidelines.adoc#api-object-formatting[API object formatting] for more details.

To avoid further confusion, do not refer to an overall OpenShift installation /
instance / cluster as an "OpenShift deployment".

Do not use: deployment configuration(s), deployment config(s)

''''
=== disconnected

Usage: disconnected environment, disconnected installation

Use "disconnected" when discussing installing a cluster in an environment that does not have an active connection to the internet. Use "disconnected" regardless of whether the restriction is physical or logical.

"Disconnected" is the preferred term over "restricted", "air-gapped", or "offline".

''''
=== Dockerfile

Usage: Dockerfile; wrapped with [filename] markup. See
link:doc_guidelines.adoc[Documentation Guidelines] for markup information.

Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a
Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands you
would normally execute manually to build a docker image.

Source: https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/

.Examples of correct usage
====
Open the [filename]#Dockerfile# and make the following changes.

Create a [filename]#Dockerfile# at the root of your repository.
====

== E

''''
=== event

Usage: event(s)

An event is a data record expressing an occurrence and its context, based on the CNCF CloudEvents specification.
Events contain two types of information: the event data representing the occurrence, and the context metadata providing contextual information about the occurrence.
Events are routed from an event producer, or source, to connected event consumers.

Routing can be performed based on information contained in the event, but an event will not identify a specific routing destination.
Events can be delivered through various industry standard protocols such as HTTP, AMQP, MQTT, or SMTP, or through messaging and broker systems, such as Kafka, NATS, AWS Kinesis, or Azure Event Grid.

When referencing the actual object, write as `Event`. See link:doc_guidelines.adoc#api-object-formatting[API object formatting] for more details.

// NOTE: This is inconsistently used, e.g. https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/rest_api/metadata_apis/event-core-v1.html
See: link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.18/#event-v1-core[Event v1 core API], link:https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/primer.md#cloudevents-concepts[CloudEvents concepts], and link:https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/spec.md#event[CloudEvents specification].

=== group/version/kind (GVK)

Usage: group/version/kind (GVK) for the first time reference; GVK thereafter.

A unique identifier for a Kubernetes API, specifying its _group_ (a collection of related APIs), _version_ (defines the release and level of stability), and _kind_ (an individual API type or name).

While "GroupVersionKind" does appear in the API guide, typically there should not be a reason to mark up in reference to a specific object. Favor simply "GVK", or "GVKs" for pluralization, after the first time reference as much as possible. Avoid pluralizing the long form (e.g., group/version/kinds or groups/versions/kinds).

''''

=== Ingress

Usage: Ingress

API object that allows developers to expose services through an HTTP(S) aware
load balancing and proxy layer via a public DNS entry. The Ingress resource may
further specify TLS options and a certificate, or specify a public CNAME that
the OpenShift Ingress Controller should also accept for HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
An administrator typically configures their Ingress Controller to be visible
outside the cluster firewall, and might also add additional security, caching, or
traffic controls on the service content.

''''

''''
=== OpenShift

Usage: OpenShift Container Platform, OpenShift Online, OpenShift Dedicated,
OpenShift Container Engine

The OpenShift product name should be paired with its product distribution /
variant name whenever possible. Previously, the upstream distribution was called
OpenShift Origin, however it is now called OKD; use of the OpenShift Origin name
is deprecated.

Avoid using the name "OpenShift" on its own when referring to something that
applies to all distributions, as OKD does not have OpenShift in its name.
However, the following components currently use "OpenShift" in the name and are
allowed for use across all distribution documentation:

- OpenShift Pipeline
- OpenShift SDN
- OpenShift Ansible Broker (deprecated in 4.2 / removed in 4.4)

Usage: Operator(s)

An Operator is a method of packaging, deploying and managing a Kubernetes
application. A Kubernetes application is an application that is both deployed on
a Kubernetes cluster (including OpenShift clusters) and managed using the
Kubernetes APIs and `kubectl` or `oc` tooling.

The term "Operator" is always captalized.

While "containerized" is allowed, do not use "Operatorize" to refer to building an
Operator that packages an application.

.Examples of correct usage

This is commonly abbreviated as SCC.

''''
=== service

Usage: service(s)

Kubernetes native API object that serves as an internal load balancer. It
identifies a set of replicated pods to proxy the connections it
receives to them. Backing pods can be added to or removed from a service
arbitrarily while the service remains consistently available, enabling anything
that depends on the service to refer to it at a consistent address.

A service is a named abstraction of software service (for example, `mysql`)
consisting of local port (for example `3306`) that the proxy listens on, and the
selector that determines which pods will answer requests sent through the proxy.
