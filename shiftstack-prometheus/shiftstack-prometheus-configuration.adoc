You can correlate observability metrics for clusters that run on {rhoso-first}. By collecting metrics from both environments, you can monitor and troubleshoot issues across the infrastructure and application layers.

There are two supported methods for metric correlation for clusters that run on {rhoso}:

- link:https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/remote_write/#remote-write-tuning[Remote writing] to an external Prometheus instance.
- Collecting data from the {ocp} federation endpoint to the {rhoso} observability stack.
