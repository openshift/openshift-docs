== Overview
OpenShift Origin has multiple installation methods available, each of which
allow you to quickly get your own OpenShift instance up and running. Depending
on your environment, you can choose the installation method that works best for
you.

For deploying a full OpenShift cluster,
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[see the advanced installation guide].

== Prerequisites

Before choosing an installation method, you must first
xref:../install_config/install/prerequisites.adoc#install-config-install-prerequisites[satisfy the prerequisites] on
your hosts, which includes verifying system and environment requirements and
installing and configuring Docker. After ensuring your hosts are properly set
up, you can continue by choosing one of the following installation methods.

Docker and OpenShift must run on the Linux operating system. If you wish to
run the server from a Windows or Mac OS X host, you should download and run
the Origin Vagrant image as described in xref:building-from-source[Method 3].

[[installation-methods]]
== Installation Methods

Choose one of the following installation methods that works best for you.

=== Method 1: Running in a Container [[running-in-a-docker-container]]
You can quickly get {product-title} running in a container using images
from https://hub.docker.com[Docker Hub] on a Linux system. This method is
supported on Fedora, CentOS, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) hosts only.

[CAUTION]
====
OpenShift Origin listens on ports 53, 7001, and 8443. If another service is
already listening on those ports you must stop that service before launching
the OpenShift container.
====

*Installing and Starting an All-in-One Server*

. Launch the server in a container:
+
----
$ sudo docker run -d --name "origin" \
        --privileged --pid=host --net=host \
        -v /:/rootfs:ro -v /var/run:/var/run:rw -v /sys:/sys -v /var/lib/docker:/var/lib/docker:rw \
        -v /var/lib/origin/openshift.local.volumes:/var/lib/origin/openshift.local.volumes:rslave \ <1>
        openshift/origin start
----
<1> `rslave` only works if the Docker version is 1.10 or later and a Red Hat distribution.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you want to use xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#install-config-aggregate-logging[OpenShift's
aggregated logging], you must add `-v /var/log:/var/log` to the `docker` command
line. The *origin* container must have access to the host's
*_var/log/containers/_* and *_/var/log/messages_*.
====
+
This command:
+
- starts OpenShift listening on all interfaces on your host (*0.0.0.0:8443*),
- starts the web console listening on all interfaces at `/console` (*0.0.0.0:8443*),
- launches an [sysitem]#etcd# server to store persistent data, and
- launches the Kubernetes system components.

. After the container is started, you can open a console inside the container:
+
----
$ sudo docker exec -it origin bash
----

If you delete the container, any configuration or stored application definitions
will also be removed.

Now that you have OpenShift successfully running in your environment,
xref:try-it-out[try it out] by walking through a sample application lifecycle.

=== Method 2: Downloading the Binary [[downloading-the-binary]]
Red Hat periodically publishes binaries to GitHub, which you can download on the
OpenShift Origin repository's
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[Releases] page. These are Linux,
Windows, or Mac OS X 64-bit binaries; note that the Mac and Windows versions are
for the CLI only.

The release archives for Linux and Mac OS X contain the server binary
`openshift` which is an all-in-one OpenShift installation. The archives for all
platforms include xref:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.adoc#cli-reference-get-started-cli[the CLI] (the `oc`
command) and the Kubernetes client (the `kubectl` command).

*Installing and Running an All-in-One Server*

. Download the binary from the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[Releases] page and untar it on your
local system.

. Add the directory you untarred the release into to your path:
+
----
$ export PATH=$(pwd):$PATH
----
+

. Launch the server:
+
----
$ sudo ./openshift start
----
+
This command:
+
--
- starts OpenShift listening on all interfaces (*0.0.0.0:8443*),
- starts the web console listening on all interfaces at `/console` (*0.0.0.0:8443*),
- launches an [sysitem]#etcd# server to store persistent data, and
- launches the Kubernetes system components.
--
+
The server runs in the foreground until you terminate the process.
+
NOTE: This command requires `root` access to create services due to the need to
modify `iptables` and mount volumes.

. OpenShift services are secured by TLS. In this path we generate a self-signed
certificate on startup which must be accepted by your web browser or client.
You must point `oc` and `curl` at the appropriate CA bundle and client key and
certificate to connect to OpenShift. Set the following environment variables:
+
----
$ export KUBECONFIG=`pwd`/openshift.local.config/master/admin.kubeconfig
$ export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=`pwd`/openshift.local.config/master/ca.crt
$ sudo chmod +r `pwd`/openshift.local.config/master/admin.kubeconfig
----
+
NOTE: This is just for example purposes; in a production environment, developers
would generate their own keys and not have access to the system keys.


*What's Next?*

Now that you have OpenShift successfully running in your environment,
xref:try-it-out[try it out] by walking through a sample application lifecycle.

=== Method 3: Building from Source [[building-from-source]]
You can build OpenShift from source locally or using
https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant]. See the OpenShift Origin repository on
GitHub
https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.html#develop-on-virtual-machine-using-vagrant[for
instructions].

[[try-it-out]]
== Try It Out

After starting an OpenShift instance, you can try it out by creating an
end-to-end application demonstrating the full OpenShift concept chain.

NOTE: When running OpenShift in a VM, you will want to ensure your host system can
access ports 8080 and 8443 inside the container for the examples below.


. Log in to the server as a regular user:
+
----
$ oc login
Username: test
Password: test
----
+
. Create a new project to hold your application:
+
----
$ oc new-project test
----
+
. Create a new application based on a Node.js image on the Docker Hub:
+
----
$ oc new-app openshift/deployment-example
----
+
Note that a service was created and given an IP - this is an address that
can be used within the cluster to access the application.
+
. Display a summary of the resources you created:
+
----
$ oc status
----
+
. The container image for your application will be pulled to the local system
and started. Once it has started it can be accessed on the host. If this is your
laptop or desktop, open a web browser to the service IP and port that was
displayed for the application:
+
----
http://172.30.192.169:8080 (example)
----
+
If you are on a separate system and do not have direct network access to the
host, SSH to the system and perform a `curl` command:
+
----
$ curl http://172.30.192.169:8080 # (example)
----
+
You should see the `v1` text displayed on the page.

Now that your application is deployed, you can trigger a new version of that
image to be rolled out to your host by tagging the `v2` image. The `new-app`
command created an image stream which tracks which images you wish to use.
Use the `tag` command to mark a new image as being desired for deployment:

----
$ oc tag deployment-example:v2 deployment-example:latest
----

Your application's deployment config is watching `deployment-example:latest`
and will trigger a new rolling deployment when the `latest` tag is updated
to the value from `v2`.

Return to the browser or use `curl` again and you should see the `v2` text
displayed on the page.

NOTE: For this next step we'll need to ensure that Docker is able to pull images
from the host system. Ensure you have completed the instructions about setting the
`--insecure-registry` flag from xref:../install_config/install/host_preparation.adoc#install-config-install-host-preparation[Host Preparation].

As a developer, building new container images is as important as deploying them.
{product-title} provides tools for running builds as well as building
source code from within predefined builder images via the Source-to-Image
toolchain.

. Switch to the administrative user and change to the `default` project:
+
----
$ oc login -u system:admin
$ oc project default
----
+
. Set up an integrated Docker registry for the OpenShift cluster:
+
----
$ oadm registry
----
+
It will take a few minutes for the registry image to download and start - use
`oc status` to know when the registry is started.

. Change back to the `test` user and `test` project:
+
----
$ oc login -u test
$ oc project test
----
+
. Create a new application that combines a builder image for Node.js with
example source code to create a new deployable Node.js image:
+
----
$ oc new-app openshift/nodejs-010-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex.git
----
+
A build will be triggered automatically using the provided image and the latest
commit to the `master` branch of the provided Git repository. To get the status
of a build, run:
+
----
$ oc status
----
+
which will summarize the build. When the build completes, the resulting container image will be pushed to the Docker registry.

. Wait for the deployed image to start, then view the service IP using your
browser or `curl`.

You can see more about the commands available in
xref:../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#cli-reference-basic-cli-operations[the CLI] (the `oc` command)
with:

----
$ oc help
----

Or connect to another system with:

----
$ oc -h <server_hostname_or_IP> [...]
----

OpenShift includes a web console which helps you visualize your applications and
perform common creation and management actions. You can use the `test` user we
created above to log in to the console via
`https://<server>:8443/console`. For more information, see
xref:../getting_started/developers_console.adoc#getting-started-developers-console[Getting Started for Developers: Web
Console].

Application Lifecycle Sample] for a more in-depth walkthrough.
