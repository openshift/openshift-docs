== Overview
{product-title} has multiple installation methods available, each of which allow
you to quickly get your own {product-title} instance up and running. Depending
on your environment, you can choose the installation method that works best for
you.

For deploying a full {product-title} cluster, see the
xref:../install/index.adoc#install-planning[Installing Clusters] guide.

== Prerequisites

Before choosing an installation method, you must first
xref:../install/prerequisites.adoc#install-config-install-prerequisites[satisfy the prerequisites] on
your hosts, which includes verifying system and environment requirements and
installing and configuring Docker. After ensuring your hosts are properly set
up, you can continue by choosing one of the following installation methods.

Docker and {product-title} must run on the Linux operating system. If you wish to
run the server from a Windows or Mac OS X host, you should start a Linux VM first.

[CAUTION]
====
{product-title} and Docker use
xref:../admin_guide/iptables.adoc#admin-guide-iptables[iptables] to manage
networking. Ensure that local firewall rules and other software making iptable
changes do not alter the {product-title} and Docker service setup.

[[get-started-cloud-providers]]
=== On-premise Versus Cloud Providers

{product-title} can be installed on-premise or hosted on public or private
clouds. For information, see
xref:../install/running_install.adoc#advanced-cloud-providers[Running Installation Playbooks].

Once you have your cluster nodes provisioned, choose the
installation method that fits your case the best.

== Installation Methods

Choose one of the following installation methods that works best for you.

=== Method 1: Running in a Container [[running-in-a-docker-container]]
You can quickly get {product-title} running in a container using images
from https://hub.docker.com[Docker Hub] on a Linux system. This method is
supported on Fedora, CentOS, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) hosts only.

[CAUTION]
====
{product-title} listens on ports 53 and 8443. If another service is
already listening on those ports you must stop that service before launching
the {product-title} container.
====

*Starting an All-in-One Server*

. Start the server:
+
----
$ oc cluster up
----
+
This command:
+
- starts {product-title} listening on local interface on your host (*127.0.0.1:8443*),
- starts the web console listening on all interfaces at `/console` (*127.0.0.1:8443*),
- launches the Kubernetes system components,
- and provisions registry, router, initial templates, and a default project.

Use the `oc cluster --help` command to get more information and view other available
command-line options.

*What's Next?*

Now that you have {product-title} successfully running in your environment,
xref:try-it-out[try it out] by walking through a sample application lifecycle.

=== Method 2: Downloading the Binary [[downloading-the-binary]]
Red Hat periodically publishes binaries to GitHub, which you can download on the
{product-title} repository's
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[Releases] page. These are Linux,
Windows, or Mac OS X 64-bit binaries; note that the Mac and Windows versions are
for the CLI only.

The release archives for Linux and Mac OS X contain the server binary
`openshift` which is an all-in-one {product-title} installation. The archives
for all platforms include xref:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.adoc#cli-reference-get-started-cli[the CLI]
(the `oc` command) and the Kubernetes client (the `kubectl` command).

*Installing and Running an All-in-One Server*

. Download the binary from the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[Releases] page and untar it on your
local system.

. Add the directory you untarred the release into to your path:
+
----
$ export PATH="$(pwd)":$PATH
----
+

. Launch the server:
+
----
$ sudo ./openshift start
----
+
This command:
+
--
- starts {product-title} listening on all interfaces (*0.0.0.0:8443*),
- starts the web console listening on all interfaces at `/console` (*0.0.0.0:8443*),
- launches an [sysitem]#etcd# server to store persistent data, and
- launches the Kubernetes system components.
--
+
The server runs in the foreground until you terminate the process.
+
NOTE: This command requires `root` access to create services due to the need to
modify `iptables` and mount volumes.

. {product-title} services are secured by TLS. In this path we generate a self-signed
certificate on startup which must be accepted by your web browser or client.
You must point `oc` and `curl` at the appropriate CA bundle and client key and
certificate to connect to {product-title}. Set the following environment variables:
+
----
$ export KUBECONFIG="$(pwd)"/openshift.local.config/master/admin.kubeconfig
$ export CURL_CA_BUNDLE="$(pwd)"/openshift.local.config/master/ca.crt
$ sudo chmod +r "$(pwd)"/openshift.local.config/master/admin.kubeconfig
----
+
NOTE: This is just for example purposes; in a production environment, developers
would generate their own keys and not have access to the system keys.


*What's Next?*

Now that you have {product-title} successfully running in your environment,
xref:try-it-out[try it out] by walking through a sample application lifecycle.

[[try-it-out]]
== Try It Out

After starting an {product-title} instance, you can try it out by creating an
end-to-end application demonstrating the full {product-title} concept chain.

NOTE: When running {product-title} in a VM, you will want to ensure your host
system can access ports 8080 and 8443 inside the container for the examples
below.


. Log in to the server as a regular user:
+
----
$ oc login
Username: test
Password: test
----
+
. Create a new project to hold your application:
+
----
$ oc new-project test
----
+
. Tag an application image from Docker Hub into your project:
+
----
$ oc tag --source=docker openshift/deployment-example:v1 deployment-example:latest
----
+
. Deploy the application image:
+
----
$ oc new-app deployment-example:latest
----
+
Note that a service was created and given an IP - this is an address that
can be used within the cluster to access the application.
+
. Display a summary of the resources you created:
+
----
$ oc status
----
+
. The container image for your application will be pulled to the local system
and started. Once it has started it can be accessed on the host. If this is your
laptop or desktop, open a web browser to the service IP and port that was
displayed for the application:
+
----
http://172.30.192.169:8080 (example)
----
+
If you are on a separate system and do not have direct network access to the
host, SSH to the system and perform a `curl` command:
+
----
$ curl http://172.30.192.169:8080 # (example)
----
+
You should see the `v1` text displayed on the page.

Now that your application is deployed, you can trigger a new version of that
image to be rolled out to your host by tagging the `v2` image. The `new-app`
command created an image stream which tracks which images you wish to use.
Use the `tag` command to mark a new image as being desired for deployment:

----
$ oc tag --source=docker openshift/deployment-example:v2 deployment-example:latest
----

Your application's deployment config is watching `deployment-example:latest`
and will trigger a new rolling deployment when the `latest` tag is updated
to the value from `v2`.

[NOTE]
====
You can also use an alternate version of the command:
----
$ oc tag docker.io/openshift/deployment-example:v2 deployment-example:latest
----
====

Return to the browser or use `curl` again and you should see the `v2` text
displayed on the page.

As a developer, building new container images is as important as deploying them.
{product-title} provides tools for running builds as well as building
source code from within predefined builder images via the Source-to-Image
toolchain.

For this procedure, ensure that Docker is able to pull images
from the host system. Also, make sure you have completed the instructions about setting the
`--insecure-registry` flag from xref:../install/host_preparation.adoc#install-config-install-host-preparation[Host Preparation].


. Switch to the administrative user and change to the `default` project:
+
----
$ oc login -u system:admin
$ oc project default
----
+
. Set up an integrated Docker registry for the {product-title} cluster:
+
----
$ oc adm registry
----
+
It will take a few minutes for the registry image to download and start; use `oc
status` to know when the registry is started.

. Change back to the `test` user and `test` project:
+
----
$ oc login -u test
$ oc project test
----
+
. Create a new application that combines a builder image for Node.js with
example source code to create a new deployable Node.js image:
+
----
$ oc new-app openshift/nodejs-010-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex.git
----
+
A build will be triggered automatically using the provided image and the latest
commit to the `master` branch of the provided Git repository. To get the status
of a build, run:
+
----
$ oc status
----
+
which will summarize the build. When the build completes, the resulting container image will be pushed to the Docker registry.

. Wait for the deployed image to start, then view the service IP using your
browser or `curl`.

You can see more about the commands available in
xref:../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#cli-reference-basic-cli-operations[the CLI] (the `oc` command)
with:

----
$ oc help
----

Or connect to another system with:

----
$ oc -h <server_hostname_or_IP> [...]
----

{product-title} includes a web console which helps you visualize your
applications and perform common creation and management actions. You can use the
`test` user we created above to log in to the console via
`https://<server>:8443/console`. For more information, see
xref:../getting_started/developers_console.adoc#getting-started-developers-console[Getting Started for Developers:
Web Console].
