== Overview
OpenShift Origin has multiple installation methods available, each of which
allow you to quickly get your own OpenShift instance up and running. Depending
on your environment, you can choose the installation method that works best for
you.

== Prerequisites

Before choosing an installation method, you must first
link:../admin_guide/install/prerequisites.html[satisfy the prerequisites] on
your hosts, which includes verifying system and environment requirements and
installing and configuring Docker. After ensuring your hosts are properly set
up, you can continue by choosing one of the following installation methods.

== Installation Methods

Choose one of the following installation methods that works best for you.

=== Method 1: Running in a Docker Container [[running-in-a-docker-container]]
You can quickly get OpenShift running in a Docker container using images from
https://hub.docker.com[Docker Hub].

*Installing and Starting an All-in-One Server*

. Launch the server in a Docker container:
+
----
$ docker run -d --name "openshift-origin" --net=host --privileged \
-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
-v /tmp/openshift:/tmp/openshift \
openshift/origin start
----
+
NOTE: The `/tmp/openshift` directory must be created the first time.
+
This command:
+
- starts OpenShift listening on all interfaces (*0.0.0.0:8443*),
- starts the web console listening on all interfaces (*0.0.0.0:8443*),
- launches an [sysitem]#etcd# server to store persistent data, and
- launches the Kubernetes system components.

By default OpenShift will use all cores in the system it runs on. You can 
choose the number of cores you want OpenShift to use by setting up `GOMAXPROCS`,
eg. pass `-e GOMAXPROCS=1` to `docker run` so OpenShift will run on one core.

. After the container is started, you can open a console inside the container:
+
----
$ docker exec -it openshift-origin bash
----

. Because OpenShift services are secured by TLS, clients must accept the server
certificates and present their own client certificate. These certificates are
generated when the master server is started. You must point `oc` and `curl` at
the appropriate CA bundle and client key and certificate to connect to
OpenShift. Set the following environment variables:
+
----
# export KUBECONFIG=/var/lib/openshift/openshift.local.config/master/admin.kubeconfig
# export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=/var/lib/openshift/openshift.local.config/master/ca.crt
----
+
NOTE: When running as a user other than `root`, you would also need to make the
private client key readable by that user. However, this is just for example
purposes; in a production environment, developers would generate their own keys
and not have access to the system keys.

. You can see more about the commands available in
link:../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html[the CLI] (the `oc` command)
with:
+
----
$ oc help
----

=== Method 2: Downloading the Binary [[downloading-the-binary]]
Red Hat periodically publishes binaries to GitHub, which you can download on the
OpenShift Origin repository's
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[Releases] page. These are Linux,
Windows, or Mac OS X 64-bit binaries; note that the Mac and Windows versions are
for the CLI only.

The tar file for each platform contains a single binary, `openshift`, which is
an all-in-one OpenShift installation. The file also contains
link:../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html[the CLI] (the `oc` command).

*Installing and Running an All-in-One Server*

. Download the binary from the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[Releases] page and untar it on your
local system.

. Launch the server:
+
----
$ sudo ./openshift start
----
+
This command:
+
- starts OpenShift listening on all interfaces (*0.0.0.0:8443*),
- starts the web console listening on all interfaces (*0.0.0.0:8443*),
- launches an [sysitem]#etcd# server to store persistent data, and
- launches the Kubernetes system components.

By default OpenShift will use all cores in the system it runs on. You can 
choose the number of cores you want OpenShift to use by setting up `GOMAXPROCS`,
eg. `export GOMAXPROCS=1` before starting the server so OpenShift will run on one core.

+
The server runs in the foreground until you terminate the process.
+
NOTE: This command requires `root` access to create services due to the need to
modify `iptables`. See
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/issues/1859[this Issue] for
more information.

. You can see more about the commands available in the binary with:
+
----
$ ./openshift help
----

. Because OpenShift services are secured by TLS, clients must accept the server
certificates and present their own client certificate. These certificates are
generated when the master server is started. You must point `oc` and `curl` at
the appropriate CA bundle and client key and certificate to connect to
OpenShift. Set the following environment variables:
+
----
$ export KUBECONFIG=`pwd`/openshift.local.config/master/admin.kubeconfig
$ export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=`pwd`/openshift.local.config/master/ca.crt
$ sudo chmod +r `pwd`/openshift.local.config/master/admin.kubeconfig
----
+
NOTE: This is just for example purposes; in a production environment, developers would generate their own keys and not have access to the system keys.

. You can see more about the commands available in the CLI with:
+
----
$ ./oc help
----
+
Or connect from another system with:
+
----
$ ./oc -h <server_hostname_or_IP> [...]
----

Now that you have OpenShift successfully running in your environment,
link:#try-it-out[try it out] by walking through a sample application lifecycle.

=== Method 3: Building from Source [[building-from-source]]
You can build OpenShift from source locally or using
https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant]. See the OpenShift Origin repository on
GitHub
https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#develop-on-virtual-machine-using-vagrant[for
instructions].

== Try It Out

After installing your OpenShift instance, you can try it out by creating an
end-to-end application, demonstrating the full OpenShift concept chain. See the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/sample-app[OpenShift 3
Application Lifecycle Sample] for instructions.
