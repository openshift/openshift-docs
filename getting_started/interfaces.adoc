== Overview
There are two interfaces available for interacting with OpenShift Online: the Management Console graphical user interface and the command line interface (CLI), referred to as the client tools.

== Management Console

* Setting up, administering and managing accounts 
* Launching new applications 
* Managing and monitoring applications

The following screenshot shows the home page of the Management Console when you first log into your account. Each tab across the top navigation bar provides further functionality to help you manage your account, applications, and more.

== Client Tools
The client tools provide a command line interface for advanced features that you can use to code, debug, and manage your applications. Installing and configuring the client tools will:

* Create an SSH key pair on your workstation and upload the public key to the remote server.
* Configure your workstation to authenticate and communicate with the remote server.
* Create an authorization token on your workstation so that you do not have enter your login credentials with each command.
