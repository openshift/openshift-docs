[[configure-overview]]
== Overview

This guide introduces you to the basic concepts of {product-title}, and helps
you configure a basic application. This guide provides the configuration steps
following
xref:../getting_started/install_openshift.adoc#getting-started-install-openshift[the
installation of a basic {product-title} environment], and is not suitable for
deploying or installing a production environment of OpenShift.

[[change-log-in-identity-provider]]
== Change Log In Identity Provider

The default behavior of a freshly installed {product-title} instance is to deny
any user from logging in. To change the authentication method to HTPasswd:

. Open the *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file in edit mode.
. Find the `identityProviders` section.
. Change
`DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider` to `HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider`
provider.
. Change the value of the name label to `htpasswd_auth` and add a
new line `file: /etc/origin/openshift-passwd` in the provider section.
+
An example `identityProviders` section with `HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider`
would look like the following.
+
----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  identityProviders:
  - challenge: true
    login: true
    name: htpasswd_auth provider
    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider
      file: /etc/origin/openshift-passwd
----

. Save the file.

[[create-user-accounts]]
== Create User Accounts

Now that you are using the `HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider` provider, you
need to generate these user accounts.

. You can use the *httpd-tools* package to obtain the *htpasswd* binary that can
generate these accounts.
+
----
# yum -y install httpd-tools
----

. Create a user account.
+
----
# touch /etc/origin/openshift-passwd
# htpasswd -b /etc/origin/openshift-passwd admin redhat
----
+
You have created a user, `admin`, with the password, `redhat`.

. Restart OpenShift before going forward.
+
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api atomic-openshift-master-controllers
----

. Give this user account `cluster-admin` privileges, which allows it to do
everything.
+
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin admin
----
+
// tag::ocadm-note[]
When running `oc adm` commands, you should run them only from 
the first master listed in the Ansible host inventory file,
by default *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*.
// end::ocadm-note[]

. You can use this username/password combination to log in via the web
console or the command line. To test this, run the following command.
+
----
$ oc login -u admin
----

Before going forward, change to the `default` project.

----
$ oc project default
----

For more details, see
xref:../admin_guide/manage_rbac.adoc#admin-guide-manage-rbac[roles]
and
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#install-config-configuring-authentication[authentication].

[[deploy-router]]
== Deploy the OpenShift Router

The OpenShift router is the entry point for external network traffic destined
for OpenShift services. It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and any TLS-enabled traffic
that uses SNI, which enables the router to send traffic to the correct service.

Without the router, OpenShift services and pods are unable to communicate with
any resource outside of the OpenShift instance.

The installer creates a default router.

. Delete the default router using the following command.
+
----
$ oc delete all -l router=router
----

. Create a new default router.
+
----
$ oc adm router --replicas=1 --service-account=router
----

The OpenShift documentation contains detailed information on
xref:../install_config/router/index.adoc#install-config-router-overview[Router Overview].

[[deploy-internal-registry]]
== Deploy an Internal Registry

Openshift provides an internal, xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#integrated-openshift-registry[integrated Docker registry] that can be deployed
to locally manage images. OpenShift uses the *docker-registry* to store,
retrieve, and build Docker images, as well as deploy and manage them throughout
their lifecycle.

The installer creates a default registry.

. Delete the default registry using the following command.
+
----
$ oc delete all -l docker-registry=default
----

. Create the *docker-registry* service in the *default* project using the
*registry* service account.
+
----
$ oc adm registry
----

[[create-persistent-storage-for-registry]]
== Create Persistent Storage for the Registry

The registry that you created in the previous step stores images and metadata,
and uses an ephemeral volume for any pod deployment if persistent storage is not
configured. This ephemeral volume is destroyed when the pod exits, losing all
data, including any images built or pushed into the registry.

To configure persistent storage for the registry:

* Provision a volume that points to a storage server on your network (we will just
create it on the master).
* Create a volume claim.
* Manually add the claim to the registry service.

NOTE: The following steps to configure persistent storage for the registry apply
to storage for any image that requires persistent data and not just for the
registry. The registry is just another image in the OpenShift environment.

[[provision-persistent-volume]]
=== Provision the Persistent Volume

. Create a registry volume file on your master, as shown here, and call it
*_registry-volume.yaml_*.
+
[subs="verbatim,macros"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pass:quotes[_registry-volume_]
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: pass:quotes[_3Gi_]
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
  nfs:
    path: /root/storage
    server: master.openshift.example.com
----
+
The folder *_/root/storage_* must exist. Make sure to change the server entry to
point to your master.

. Create the registry persistent volume in OpenShift.
+
----
$ oc create -f registry-volume.yaml
----

[[create-persistent-volume-claim]]
=== Create the Persistent Volume Claim

Create a claim to bind the persistent volume created earlier. This claim is what
ties the registry service to the persistent volume.

. Create another file called *_registry-volume-claim.yaml_*.
+
[subs="verbatim,macros"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pass:quotes[_registry-volume-claim_]
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 3Gi
----

. Create the claim.
+
----
$ oc create -f registry-volume-claim.yaml
----

You have now created the Persistent Volume and the Persistent Volume Claim, and
now need to add this claim to the registry.

[[add-claim-to-registry]]
=== Add the Persistent Volume Claim to the Registry

[subs="verbatim,macros"]
----
$ oc volume dc/docker-registry \
    --add --overwrite -t persistentVolumeClaim \
    --claim-name=pass:quotes[_registry-volume-claim_] \
    --name=registry-storage
----

The *docker-registry* will now use the 3 GB persistent volume created for
storing image and metadata.
