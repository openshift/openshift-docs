[[configure-overview]]
== Overview

This guide introduces you to the basic concepts of {product-title}, and helps
you configure a basic application. This guide provides the configuration steps
following
xref:../getting_started/install_openshift.adoc#getting-started-install-openshift[the
installation of a basic {product-title} environment], and is not suitable for
deploying or installing a production environment of OpenShift.

[[change-log-in-identity-provider]]
== Change Log In Identity Provider

The default behavior of a freshly installed {product-title} instance is to deny
any user from logging in. To change the authentication method to HTPasswd:

. Open the *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file in edit mode.
. Find the `identityProviders` section.
. Change
`DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider` to `HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider`
provider.
. Change the value of the name label to `htpasswd_auth` and add a
new line `file: /etc/origin/master/htpasswd` in the provider section.
+
An example `identityProviders` section with `HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider`
would look like the following.
+
[source,yaml]
----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  identityProviders:
  - challenge: true
    login: true
    name: htpasswd_auth provider
    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider
      file: /etc/origin/master/htpasswd
----

. Save the file.

[[create-user-accounts]]
== Create User Accounts

Now that you are using the `HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider` provider, you
need to generate these user accounts.

. You can use the *httpd-tools* package to obtain the *htpasswd* binary that can
generate these accounts.
+
[source,terminal]
----
# yum -y install httpd-tools
----

. Create a user account.
+
[source,terminal]
----
# touch /etc/origin/master/htpasswd
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
# htpasswd -b /etc/origin/master/htpasswd admin redhat
----
+
You have created a user, `admin`, with the password, `redhat`.

. Restart OpenShift before going forward.
+
[source,terminal]
----
# master-restart api
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
# master-restart controllers
----

. Give this user account `cluster-admin` privileges, which allows it to do
everything.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin admin
----
+
// tag::ocadm-note[]
When running `oc adm` commands, you should run them only from
the first master listed in the Ansible host inventory file,
by default *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*.
// end::ocadm-note[]

. You can use this username/password combination to log in via the web
console or the command line. To test this, run the following command.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login -u admin
----

Before going forward, change to the `default` project.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project default
----

For more details, see
xref:../admin_guide/manage_rbac.adoc#admin-guide-manage-rbac[roles]
and
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#install-config-configuring-authentication[authentication].

[[deploy-router]]
== Deploy the OpenShift Router

The OpenShift router is the entry point for external network traffic destined
for OpenShift services. It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and any TLS-enabled traffic
that uses SNI, which enables the router to send traffic to the correct service.

Without the router, OpenShift services and pods are unable to communicate with
any resource outside of the OpenShift instance.

The installer creates a default router.

. Delete the default router using the following command.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete all -l router=router
----

. Create a new default router.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm router --replicas=1 --service-account=router
----

The OpenShift documentation contains detailed information on
xref:../install_config/router/index.adoc#install-config-router-overview[Router Overview].

[[deploy-internal-registry]]
== Deploy an Internal Registry

Openshift provides an internal, xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#integrated-openshift-registry[integrated container image registry] that can be deployed
to locally manage images. OpenShift uses the *docker-registry* to store,
retrieve, and build container images, as well as deploy and manage them throughout
their lifecycle.

The installer creates a default registry.
