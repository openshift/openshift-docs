== Overview

This getting started experience walks you through the simplest way to get a
sample project up and running on OpenShift. There are a few different ways to
launch images within a project, but this topic focuses on the quickest and
easiest method.

If this is the first part of the documentation you have read, and you are
unfamiliar with the core concepts of OpenShift version 3, you might want to
start by reading about
xref:../../whats_new/index.adoc#whats-new-index[what's new]. This version
of OpenShift is significantly different from version 2.

The following sections guide you through creating a project that contains a
sample Node.js application that will serve a welcome page and the current hit
count (stored in a database).

== Before You Begin

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Before you can get started using OpenShift Enterprise:

- You must be able to access a running instance of OpenShift Enterprise. If you do not have access, then contact your cluster administrator.
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Before you can get started using OpenShift:

- You must be able to access a running instance of OpenShift. If you do not have access, then contact your cluster administrator.
endif::openshift-origin[]

- Your instance must be pre-configured by a cluster administrator with the InstantApp templates and builder images. If they
are not available, direct your cluster administrator to the
xref:../../install_config/install/first_steps.adoc#install-config-install-first-steps[First Steps] topic.
- You must have an account on http://www.github.com[GitHub], have https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/[Git set up], and
https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/#next-steps-authenticating-with-github-from-git[set up authentication to GitHub from Git].
- You must have the OpenShift CLI
xref:../../cli_reference/get_started_cli.adoc#cli-reference-get-started-cli[downloaded and installed].

// end::beforeyoubegin[]

// tag::forking[]

== Forking the Sample Repository

. Visit the https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex[Node.js example] page while you are logged in to GitHub.
. https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[Fork the repository].
+
You are redirected to your new fork.
. Copy the clone URL for your fork.
. Clone the repository to your local machine.

// end::forking[]

== Creating a Project

To create an application, you must create a new project and specify the location of the source. From there, OpenShift begins the build process and creates a new deployment.

. Log into OpenShift from the CLI:
+
----
$ oc login --token=<tokenID> --server=<https://api.your-openshift-server.com>
----
. To create a new project:
+
----
$ oc new-project <projectname> --description="<description>" --display-name="<display_name>"
----

== Uploading a Template
. To upload the *_nodejs-mongodb.json_* template to your current project's template library:
+
----
$ oc create -f nodejs-mongodb.json
----

== Creating an Application
. To create a new application from the previously uploaded template:
+
----
$ oc process nodejs-mongodb.json
----

Your application is then created, which might take some time. In the case of
this template, MongoDB is created first, then the Node.js application is built
using the OpenShift source-to-image (S2I) builder.

You can follow along on the Overview page of the web console to see the new
resources being created, and watch the progress of the build and deployment. While the MongoDB pod is being created, its status is shown as pending. The MongoDB pod then starts up and displays its newly-assigned IP address.

When the Node.js pod is running, the build is complete.

You can also use the `oc get pods` command to check when the pod is up and
running.

The `oc status` command tells you what IP address the service is running; the
default port it deploys to is 8080.

== View the Running Application

To view your new application:

. Determine the service IP for the application:
+
----
$ oc get svc
----
. Run the application:
+
----
$ curl <service-IP-address>:8080
----
. To view the applictation, browse to: http://<service-IP-address>:8080

include::getting_started/developers/developers_console.adoc[tag=deploycode1]
+
. Modify the `*BuildConfig*` within the template to define the GitHub webhook trigger.
. Specify a `*secret*` as part of the webhook. For example:
+
====

----
{
  "type": "github",
  "github": {
    "secret": "secret101"
  }
}
----
====
+
The secret ensures that only you and your repository can trigger the build.
. Run the following command to display the webhook URLs associated with your `*BuildConfig*`:
+
----
$ oc describe buildConfig <name>
----
+
. Copy the webhook URL output by the above command. If the above command does not display any webhook URLs, then no webhook trigger is defined for that build configuration.
. Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub, then click *Settings*.
. Click *Webhooks & Services*.
. Click btn:[Add webhook].
. Paste your webhook URL into the *Payload URL* field.
. Click btn:[Add webhook] to save.

=== Deploying Code Changes Manually

To manually rebuild the image based on your latest committed change to your forked repository:

----
$ oc start-build nodejs-ex
----

include::getting_started/developers/developers_console.adoc[tag=deploycode3]

== Troubleshooting

*Changing projects:*

Although the `oc new-project` command automatically sets your current project to the one you've just created, you can always change projects by running:
----
$ oc project <project-name>
----

To view a list of projects:
----
$ oc get projects
----

*Manually triggering builds:*

If the build does not start automatically, start a build and stream the logs:
----
$ oc start-build nodejs-ex --follow
----

Alternatively, do not include `--follow` in the above command, and instead issue the following command after triggering the build, where `n` is the number of the build to track:
----
$ oc build-logs nodejs-ex-n
----
