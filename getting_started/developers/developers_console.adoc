== Browser Requirements

Review the
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.html[browser versions
and operating systems] that can be used to access the web console.

== Creating a Project

To create an application, you must first create a new project, then select an
InstantApp template. From there, OpenShift begins the build process and creates
a new deployment.

. Visit the OpenShift web console in your browser. The web console uses a self-signed certificate, so if prompted, continue past a browser warning.
. Log in using the username and password recommended to you by your administrator.
. To create a new project, click btn:[New Project].
. Type a unique name, display name, and description for the new project.
. Click btn:[Create].
+
The web console's welcome screen loads.

== Creating an Application

. To create a new application, click btn:[Add to Project].
+
The Add to Project page loads, and gives you the option to create from a publicly accessible git repository, or from a template.
. Click the btn:[nodejs-mongodb-example] template.
+
The template configuration page loads, displaying pre-configured parameters.
. Click btn:[Edit Parameters], then update the source repository URL to your forked repository: `https://github.com/<your_github_username>/nodejs-ex.git`
. Type a secret in the *GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET* field. This webhook secures the trigger that causes your application to automatically rebuild whenever you push a code change to your forked repository.
. Click btn:[Create].
+
[NOTE]
====
After creation, these settings can only be modified from the CLI by using the
`oc` command.
====

Your application is then created, which might take some time. In the case of
this template, MongoDB is created first, then the Node.js application is built
using the OpenShift source-to-image (S2I) builder.

You can follow along on the Overview page of the web console to see the new
resources being created, and watch the progress of the build and deployment. While the MongoDB pod is being created, its status is shown as pending. The MongoDB pod then starts up and displays its newly-assigned IP address.

When the Node.js pod is running, the build is complete.

== Viewing the Running Application
If your DNS is correctly configured, then your new application can be accessed using a web browser. If you cannot access your application, then speak with your system administrator.

To view your new application:

. In the web console, view the overview page to determine the web address for the application. For example: `http://nodejs-mongodb-example.openshiftapps.com`
. Visit the web address for your new application.

// tag::deploycode1[]

== Configuring Automated Builds

You forked the source code for this application from the
https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex[OpenShift GitHub repository]. Therefore,
you can use a webhook to automatically trigger a rebuild of your application
whenever you push code changes to your forked repository.

To set up a webhook for your application:

// end::deploycode1[]

. From the Web Console, navigate to the project containing your application.
. Click the btn:[Browse] tab, then click btn:[Builds].
. Click image:copy.jpg["Copy"] to copy your GitHub webhook.
. Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub, then click *Settings*.
. Click *Webhooks & Services*.
. Click btn:[Add webhook].
. Paste your webhook URL into the *Payload URL* field.
. In the *Secret* field, type the secret you chose when creating your application.
. Click btn:[Add webhook] to save.

GitHub now attempts to ping the OpenShift server to ensure that communication is successful. If it is correctly configured, you will see a green check mark next to your new webhook URL. Hover your mouse over the check mark to see the status of the last delivery.

The next time you push a code change to your forked repository, your application will automatically rebuild.

// tag::deploycode3[]

== Writing a Code Change

To work locally and then push changes to your application:

. On your local machine, use a text editor to change the sample application's source for the file *_nodejs-ex/views/index.html_*
. Make a code change that will be visible from within your application. For example: on line 219, change the title from `Welcome to your Node.js application on OpenShift` to `This is my awesome Node.js application on OpenShift`, then save your changes.
. Commit the changes in git, and push the change to your fork.
+
If your webhook is correctly configured, your application will immediately rebuild itself based on your changes. View your application using a web browser to see your changes.

Now all you need to do is push code updates, and OpenShift handles the rest.

// end::deploycode3[]

=== Manually Rebuilding Images

You may find it useful to manually rebuild an image if your webhook is not
working, or if a build fails and you do not want to change the code before restarting the build. To manually rebuild the image based on
your latest committed change to your forked repository:

. Click the *Browse* tab, then click btn:[Builds].
. Find your build, then click btn:[Rebuild].
