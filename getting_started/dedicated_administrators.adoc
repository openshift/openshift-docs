== Overview

As an administrator of an {product-title} cluster, your account has additional
permissions and access to all user-created projects in your organization's
cluster. While logged in to an account with this role, the basic
xref:../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#cli-reference-basic-cli-operations[developer CLI] (the `oc`
command) allows you increased visibility and management capabilities over
objects across projects, while the
xref:../cli_reference/admin_cli_operations.adoc#cli-reference-admin-cli-operations[administrator CLI] (commands
under the `oc adm` command, and formerly the `oadm` command) open up additional
operations.

[NOTE]
====
While your account does have these increased permissions, the actual cluster
maintenance and host configuration is still performed by the OpenShift
Operations Team. If you would like to request a change to your cluster that you
cannot perform using the administrator CLI, please open a support case on the
https://access.redhat.com/support/[Red Hat Customer Portal].
====

[[gs-dedicated-admin-downloading-the-cli]]
== Downloading the CLI

The `oc` CLI used for both normal developer operations and administrator
operations is available for download from the *About* page in the web console.
See xref:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.adoc#cli-reference-get-started-cli[Get Started with the CLI] for
more detailed installation steps.

[[gs-dedicated-admin-logging-in]]
== Logging In and Verifying Permissions

You can log in as an {product-title} cluster administration via the web console
or CLI, just as you would if you were an application developer.

When you xref:../dev_guide/authentication.adoc#web-console-authentication[log in
to the web console], all user-created projects across the cluster are visible
from the main *Projects* page.

Use the standard `oc login` command to log in with the CLI:

----
$ oc login <your_instance_url>
----

All projects are visible using:

----
$ oc get projects
----

When your account has the *dedicated-cluster-admin* authorization role
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[bound] to it,
you are automatically bound to the *dedicated-project-admin* for any new
projects that are created by users in the cluster.

To verify if your account has administrator privileges, run the following
command against a user-created project to view its default
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authorization[policy bindings]. If
you are a cluster administrator, you will see your account listed under
*RoleBinding[dedicated-project-admin]* for the project:

====
----
$ oc describe policyBindings :default -n <project_name>

Name:					:default
Created:				2 weeks ago
Labels:					<none>
Annotations:				<none>
Last Modified:				2016-05-03 05:34:49 -0400 EDT
Policy:					<none>
RoleBinding[admin]:
					Role:			admin
					Users:			fred@example.com <1>
					Groups:			<none>
					ServiceAccounts:	<none>
					Subjects:		<none>
RoleBinding[dedicated-project-admin]:
					Role:			dedicated-project-admin
					Users:			alice@example.com, bob@example.com <2>
					Groups:			<none>
					ServiceAccounts:	<none>
					Subjects:		<none>
...
----
<1> The *fred@example.com* user is a normal, project-scoped administrator for this
project.
<2> The *alice@example.com* and *bob@example.com* users are cluster administrators.
====

To view details on your increased permissions, and the sets of
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#evaluating-authorization[verbs
and resources] associated with the *dedicated-cluster-admin* and
*dedicated-project-admin* roles, run the following:

----
$ oc describe clusterrole/dedicated-cluster-admin
$ oc describe clusterrole/dedicated-project-admin
----

[[gs-dedicated-admin-managing-admin-list]]
== Managing Dedicated Administrators

Administrator roles are managed using a `dedicated-admins` group on the cluster.
Existing members of this group can edit membership. To view a list of current
dedicated administrators by user name, you can use the following command:

----
$ oc describe group dedicated-admins
----

To add a new member to the `dedicated-admins` group:

----
$ oadm groups add-users dedicated-admins <user_name>
----

To remove an existing user from the `dedicated-admins` group:

----
$ oadm groups remove-users dedicated-admins <user_name>
----

If this group is currently empty or if you need assistance editing group
membership, please open a support case on the
link:https://access.redhat.com/support/[Red Hat Customer Portal].

[[gs-dedicated-admin-granting-permissions]]
== Granting Permissions to Users or Groups

To grant permissions to other
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.adoc#users-and-groups[users
or groups], you can add, or _bind_, a role to them using the following commands:

----
$ oadm policy add-role-to-user <role> <user_name>
$ oadm policy add-role-to-group <role> <group_name>
----

See xref:../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.adoc#admin-guide-manage-authorization-policy[Managing Authorization
Policies] for more details on these and related authorization tasks.

[[gs-dedicated-admin-creating-service-accounts]]
== Creating Service Accounts

You can create a
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#users[service
account] to be able to run applications like Jenkins that make calls back to
{product-title}.

See the xref:../dev_guide/service_accounts.adoc#dev-guide-service-accounts[Developer Guide] for basic
service account management tasks, which as a cluster administrator you can
perform in any user-created project, and see
xref:../admin_guide/service_accounts.adoc#admin-guide-service-accounts[Configuring Service Accounts] for more
advanced, cluster-wide settings.

[[gs-dedicated-admin-managing-quotas-and-limit-ranges]]
== Managing Quotas and Limit Ranges

As a cluster administrator, you are able to view, create, and modify
xref:../admin_guide/quota.adoc#admin-guide-quota[quotas] and xref:../admin_guide/limits.adoc#admin-guide-limits[limit
ranges] on other projects. This allows you to better constrain how compute
resources and objects are consumed by users across the cluster.

Defaults can be set for quotas and limit ranges for new projects at creation. To
request such a change, please open a support case on the
https://access.redhat.com/support/[Red Hat Customer Portal].

cluster settings can be configured for you by the OpenShift Operations Team.
