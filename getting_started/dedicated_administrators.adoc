== Overview

As an administrator of an {product-title} cluster, your account has additional
permissions and access to all user-created projects in your organization's
cluster. While logged in to an account with this role, the basic
xref:../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#cli-reference-basic-cli-operations[developer CLI] (the `oc`
command) allows you increased visibility and management capabilities over
objects across projects, while the
xref:../cli_reference/admin_cli_operations.adoc#cli-reference-admin-cli-operations[administrator CLI] (commands
under the `oc adm` command, and formerly the `oadm` command) open up additional
operations.

[NOTE]
====
While your account does have these increased permissions, the actual cluster
maintenance and host configuration is still performed by the {product-title}
Operations Team. If you would like to request a change to your cluster that you
cannot perform using the administrator CLI, open a support case on the
https://access.redhat.com/support/[Red Hat Customer Portal].

[[gs-dedicated-admin-downloading-the-cli]]
== Downloading the CLI

The `oc` CLI used for both normal developer operations and administrator
operations is available for download from the *Command Line Tools* page in the
web console. See
xref:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.adoc#cli-reference-get-started-cli[Get
Started with the CLI] for more detailed installation steps.

[[gs-dedicated-admin-logging-in]]
== Logging In and Verifying Permissions

You can log in as an {product-title} cluster administration via the web console
or CLI, just as you would if you were an application developer.

When you xref:../dev_guide/authentication.adoc#web-console-authentication[log in
to the web console], all user-created projects across the cluster are visible
from the main *Projects* page.

Use the standard `oc login` command to log in with the CLI:

----
$ oc login <your_instance_url>
----

All projects are visible using:

----
$ oc get projects
----

When your account has the *dedicated-cluster-admin* cluster role
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[bound] to it,
you are automatically bound to the *dedicated-project-admin* for any new
projects that are created by users in the cluster.

To verify if your account has administrator privileges, run the following
command against a user-created project to view its default
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authorization[role bindings].
If you are a cluster administrator, you will see your account listed under
subjects for the *dedicated-project-admin* role binding for the project:

----
$ oc describe rolebinding.rbac -n <project_name>

Name:		admin
Labels:		<none>
Annotations:	<none>
Role:
  Kind:	ClusterRole
  Name:	admin
Subjects:
  Kind	Name			Namespace
  ----	----			---------
  User	fred@example.com <1>


Name:		dedicated-project-admin
Labels:		<none>
Annotations:	<none>
Role:
  Kind:	ClusterRole
  Name:	dedicated-project-admin
Subjects:
  Kind	Name			Namespace
  ----	----			---------
  User	alice@example.com <2>
  User	bob@example.com <2>
...
----
<1> The *fred@example.com* user is a normal, project-scoped administrator for this
project.
<2> The *alice@example.com* and *bob@example.com* users are cluster administrators.

To view details on your increased permissions, and the sets of
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#evaluating-authorization[verbs
and resources] associated with the *dedicated-cluster-admin* and
*dedicated-project-admin* roles, run the following:

----
$ oc describe clusterrole.rbac dedicated-cluster-admin
$ oc describe clusterrole.rbac dedicated-project-admin
----

[[gs-dedicated-admin-managing-admin-list]]
== Managing Dedicated Administrators

Administrator roles are managed using a `dedicated-admins` group on the cluster.
Existing members of this group can edit membership. To view a list of current
dedicated administrators by user name, you can use the following command:

----
$ oc describe group dedicated-admins
----

To add a new member to the `dedicated-admins` group:

----
$ oc adm groups add-users dedicated-admins <user_name>
----

To remove an existing user from the `dedicated-admins` group:

----
$ oc adm groups remove-users dedicated-admins <user_name>
----

If this group is currently empty or if you need assistance editing group
membership, open a support case on the
link:https://access.redhat.com/support/[Red Hat Customer Portal].

[[gs-dedicated-admin-granting-permissions]]
== Granting Permissions to Users or Groups

To grant permissions to other
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.adoc#users-and-groups[users
or groups], you can add, or _bind_, a role to them using the following commands:

----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user <role> <user_name>
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-group <role> <group_name>
----

See xref:../admin_guide/manage_rbac.adoc#admin-guide-manage-rbac[Managing RBAC]
for more details on these and related authorization tasks.

[[gs-dedicated-admin-creating-service-accounts]]
== Creating Service Accounts

You can create a
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#users[service
account] to be able to run applications like Jenkins that make calls back to
{product-title}.

See the xref:../dev_guide/service_accounts.adoc#dev-guide-service-accounts[Developer Guide] for basic
service account management tasks, which as a cluster administrator you can
perform in any user-created project, and see
xref:../admin_guide/service_accounts.adoc#admin-guide-service-accounts[Configuring Service Accounts] for more
advanced, cluster-wide settings.

[[gs-dedicated-admin-managing-quotas-and-limit-ranges]]
== Managing Quotas and Limit Ranges

As an administrator, you are able to view, create, and modify
xref:../admin_guide/quota.adoc#admin-guide-quota[quotas] and xref:../admin_guide/limits.adoc#admin-guide-limits[limit
ranges] on other projects. This allows you to better constrain how compute
resources and objects are consumed by users across the cluster.

Defaults can be set for quotas and limit ranges for new projects at creation. To
request such a change, open a support case on the
https://access.redhat.com/support/[Red Hat Customer Portal].

[[gs-dedicated-admin-whats-next]]
== What's Next?

Further explore the xref:../admin_guide/index.adoc#admin-guide-index[Cluster Administration] guide
for more reference information on what's possible with your role and what other
cluster settings can be configured for you by the {product-title} Operations
Team.
