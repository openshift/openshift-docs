== Introduction

{product-title} brings together Docker and Kubernetes, and provides an API to
manage these services. {product-title} allows you to create and manage
containers.

[[why-use-openshift]]
=== Why Should I Use OpenShift?

Containers are standalone processes that run within their own environment,
independent of operating system and the underlying infrastructure. OpenShift
helps you to develop, deploy, and manage container-based applications. It
provides you with a self-service platform to create, modify, and deploy
applications on demand, thus enabling faster development and release life
cycles.

_Think_ of images as cookie cutters and containers as the actual cookies.

_Think_ of OpenShift as an operating system, images as applications that you run
on them, and the containers as the actual running instances of those
applications.
