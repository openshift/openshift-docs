[[introduction]]
== Introduction
{product-title} is a platform as a service (PaaS) offering from Red Hat
that brings together Docker, Kubernetes, and an API to manage these services.
{product-title} allows you to create and manage containers.
Containers are standalone processes that run within their own environment.

[[why-use-openshift]]
=== Why should I use OpenShift?

Containers are standalone processes that run within their own environment,
independent of operating system and the underlying infrastructure. OpenShift
helps you to develop, deploy, and manage container-based applications. It
provides you with a self-service platform to create, modify, and deploy
applications on demand. Thus enabling faster development and release life
cycles.

_Think_ of images as cookie cutters and containers as the actual cookies.

_Think_ of OpenShift as an operating system, images as applications that you run
on them, and the containers as the actual running instances of those
applications.

{product-title} 3 is Red Hat's application hosting platform that makes it easy
for developers to quickly build, launch, and scale container-based web apps in a
public cloud environment.

Check out the following topics to get started as an *application developer*
trying out {product-title} {product-version}:

* Step through a xref:../getting_started/basic_walkthrough.adoc#getting-started-basic-walkthrough[*basic walkthrough*]
using the web console and create your first project and application.
* Go xref:../getting_started/beyond_the_basics.adoc#getting-started-beyond-the-basics[*beyond the basics*] and get
hands-on with the CLI.
* Connect to {product-title} using
http://tools.jboss.org/features/openshift.html#openshift-3[*Eclipse tooling*].
* If you are familiar with {product-title} 2, learn about some xref:../getting_started/online_v2_vs_v3.adoc#getting-started-online-v2-vs-v3[*architectural and
terminology changes*] introduced with {product-title} 3.

If you do not already have {product-title} installed, the following sections
will help guide you through the installation process:

* xref:../getting_started/index.adoc#install-openshift[Installing {product-title}]
* xref:../getting_started/index.adoc#interact-with-openshift[Interact with {product-title}]
* xref:../getting_started/index.adoc#roles-and-authentication[Understand Roles and Authentication]
* xref:../getting_started/index.adoc#deploy-router[Deploy the OpenShift Router]
* xref:../getting_started/beyond_the_basics.adoc#deploy-docker-registry[a Docker Registry]

[[install-openshift]]
== Install {product-title}

To install {product-title}, refer to the
xref:../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[Quick
Installation Guide] or xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[Advanced
Installation Guide].

You will need to ensure you
xref:../install_config/install/prerequisites.adoc#install-config-install-prerequisites[meet
the prerequisites] on your hosts, which includes verifying system and
environment requirements and properly installing and configuring Docker.

[[interact-with-openshift]]
== Interact with {product-title}

{product-title} provides two command line utilities to interact with it.

* `oc`: for normal project and application management
* `oadm`: for administrative tasks

Use `oc --help` and `oadm --help` to view all available options.

In addition, you can use the web console to manage projects and applications.

[[roles-and-authentication]]
== Understand Roles and Authentication

By default, when installed for the first time, there are no roles or user
accounts created in {product-title}, so you need to create them. You have the
option to either create new roles or define a policy that allows anyone to log
in (to start you off). See the
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#install-config-configuring-authentication[Configuring
Authentication and User Agent] section for instructions.

For more information, see xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authorization[Authorization].

[[deploy-router]]
== Deploy the OpenShift Router

The OpenShift router is the entry point for external network traffic destined
for OpenShift services. It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and any TLS-enabled traffic
that uses SNI, which enables the router to send traffic to the correct service.

Without the router, OpenShift services and pods are unable to communicate with
any resource outside of the OpenShift instance.

For more information on routers, see xref:../install_config/router/index.adoc#install-config-router-overview[Router Overview].

To deploy a router, see xref:../install_config/router/customized_haproxy_router.adoc#install-config-router-customized-haproxy[Deploying a Customized HAProxy Router].

[[deploy-docker-registry]]
== Deploy a Docker Registry

Openshift provides an internal, integrated Docker registry that can be deployed
to locally manage images. OpenShift uses the *docker-registry* to store,
retrieve, and build Docker images, as well as deploy and manage them throughout
their lifecycle.

For more information on Docker Registry, see xref:../install_config/registry/index.adoc#install-config-registry-overview[Registry Overview].

To deploy a registry, see xref:../install_config/registry/deploy_registry_existing_clusters.adoc#install-config-deploy-registry-existing-clusters[Deploying a Registry on Existing Clusters].
