== Overview

This getting started experience walks you through the simplest way to get a
sample project up and running on {product-title}. There are a few different ways
to launch images within a project, but this topic focuses on the quickest and
easiest method.

If this is the first part of the documentation you have read, and you are
unfamiliar with the core concepts of {product-title} version 3 (v3), you might want to
start by reading about
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
xref:../release_notes/index.adoc#release-notes-index[what's new].
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
xref:../whats_new/index.adoc#whats-new-index[what's new].
endif::[]
This version of {product-title} is significantly different from version 2 (v2).

// end::overview[]

// tag::overview-online[]

ifdef::openshift-online[]
Similar to xref:../getting_started/online_v2_vs_v3.adoc#getting-started-online-v2-vs-v3[{product-title} v2],
endif::[]
{product-title} 3 provides out of the box a set of
xref:../using_images/s2i_images/index.adoc#using-images-s2i-images-index[languages] and
xref:../using_images/db_images/index.adoc#using-images-db-images-index[databases] for developers with
corresponding implementations and tutorials that allow you to kickstart your
application development. Language support centers around the
xref:../dev_guide/dev_tutorials/quickstarts.adoc#dev-guide-app-tutorials-quickstarts[Quickstart templates], which in
turn leverage xref:../using_images/s2i_images/index.adoc#using-images-s2i-images-index[builder images].

To help illustrate constructing such applications, the following sections guide
you through creating a project that contains a sample Node.js application that
will serve a welcome page and the current hit count (stored in a database).

[NOTE]
====
This topic discusses both
xref:../dev_guide/dev_tutorials/quickstarts.adoc#dev-guide-app-tutorials-quickstarts[Quickstart] and
xref:../dev_guide/templates.adoc#using-the-instantapp-templates[Instant App]
templates and applications. Quickstarts provide a starting point for application
development, but they rely on your development to create a useful application.
In contrast, Instant Apps like Jenkins are instantly usable.

// tag::beforeyoubegin[]

== Before You Begin

Before you can get started:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
- You must be able to access a running instance of {product-title}. If you do
not have access, contact your cluster administrator.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-online[]
- Visit link:https://manage.openshift.com[manage.openshift.com] to register for {product-title} {product-version} for free today.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
- Your instance must be pre-configured by a cluster administrator with the
xref:../dev_guide/templates.adoc#using-the-instantapp-templates[Instant App templates]
and xref:../using_images/s2i_images/index.adoc#using-images-s2i-images-index[builder images]. If they
are not available,
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
direct your cluster administrator to the
xref:../install_config/imagestreams_templates.adoc#install-config-imagestreams-templates[Loading the Default Image Streams and Templates] topic.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
contact your cluster administrator.
endif::[]
- You must have the {product-title} CLI
xref:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.adoc#cli-reference-get-started-cli[downloaded and installed].

// end::beforeyoubegin[]

[[developers-cli-forking-the-sample-repository]]

// tag::forking[]

== Forking the Sample Repository

. Visit the https://github.com/sclorg/ruby-ex[Ruby example] page while you are logged in to GitHub.
+
[NOTE]
====
This topic follows the Ruby example, but you can follow along using any of the language examples
xref:getting-started-developers-cli-languages[provided in the {product-title} GitHub project].
====
+
. https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[Fork the repository].
+
You are redirected to your new fork.
. Copy the clone URL for your fork.
. Clone the repository to your local machine.

// end::forking[]

[[developers-cli-creating-a-project]]
== Creating a Project

To create an application, you must create a new project and specify the location
of the source. From there, {product-title} begins the build process and creates
a new deployment.

. Log in to {product-title} from the CLI:
ifndef::openshift-aro[]
+
* With username and password:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login -u=<username> -p=<password> --server=<your-openshift-server> --insecure-skip-tls-verify
----
endif::[]
+
* With oauth token:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login <https://api.your-openshift-server.com> --token=<tokenID>
----
. To create a new project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project <projectname> --description="<description>" --display-name="<display_name>"
----

After creating the new project, you will be automatically switched to the new
project namespace.

[[developers-cli-creating-an-application]]
== Creating an Application
To create a new application from the code in your forked repository:

. Create the application by specifying the source of the code:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app openshift/ruby-20-centos7~https://github.com/<your_github_username>/ruby-ex
----
+
{product-title} finds the matching builder image (which in this case is *ruby-20-centos7*) and then creates resources for the application (image stream, build configuration, deployment configuration, service). It also schedules the build.
. Track the progress of the build:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs -f bc/ruby-ex
----
. Once the build is complete and the resulting image has successfully pushed to your registry, check the status of your application:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc status
----
+
Or you can view the build from the web console.

Creating your application might take some time. You can follow along on the Overview page of the web console to see the new
resources being created, and watch the progress of the build and deployment.
You can also use the `oc get pods` command to check when the pod is up and
running, or the `oc get builds` command to see build statistics.

While the Ruby pod is being created, its status is shown as pending. The
Ruby pod then starts up and displays its newly-assigned IP address. When the Ruby pod is running, the build is complete.

The `oc status` command tells you what IP address the service is running; the
default port it deploys to is 8080.

[[developers-cli-create-route]]
== Create a Route

An {product-title} route exposes a service at a host name, so that external clients can reach it by name. To create a route to your new application:

. Expose a service for `ruby-ex`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc expose service ruby-ex
----
. View your new route:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get route
----
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
. Copy the route location, which will be something like `ruby-ex-my-test.example.openshiftapps.com`.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-aro[]
. Copy the route location, which will be something like `ruby-ex-my-test.apps.<random>.<cluster-region>.azmosa.io`.
endif::[]

[[developers-cli-view-running-app]]
== Verify the Application is Running

To view your new application, paste the route location that you copied (in the previous section) into the address bar of your web browser and hit enter.

The example `ruby-ex` application is a simple welcome screen, and contains details on how to deploy code changes, manage your application, and other development resources.

Next, configure automated builds via a GitHub webhook trigger, so that code changes in your forked repository cause your application to rebuild.

include::getting_started/developers_console.adoc[tag=deploycode1]
. View the triggers section of the `*BuildConfig*` to verify that a GitHub webhook trigger exists:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit bc/ruby-ex
----
+
You should see something similar to this:
+
[source,yaml]
----
triggers
- github:
    secret: Q1tGY0i9f1ZFihQbX07S
    type: GitHub
----
The secret ensures that only you and your repository can trigger the build.
. Run the following command to display the webhook URLs associated with your
`*BuildConfig*`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe bc ruby-ex
----
+
. Copy the GitHub webhook payload URL output by the above command.
include::getting_started/developers_console.adoc[tag=deploycode2]

[[developers-cli-writing-a-code-change]]
include::getting_started/developers_console.adoc[tag=deploycode3]

[[developers-cli-manually-rebuilding-images]]
=== Manually Rebuilding Images

You may find it useful to manually rebuild an image if your webhook is not
working, or if a build fails and you do not want to change the code before
restarting the build. To manually rebuild the image based on your latest
committed change to your forked repository:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc start-build ruby-ex
----

[[developers-cli-troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting

[[developers-cli-troubleshooting-change-projects]]
*Changing Projects*

Although the `oc new-project` command automatically sets your current project to
the one you've just created, you can always change projects by running:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project <project-name>
----

To view a list of projects:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get projects
----

[[developers-cli-troubleshooting-manually-triggering-builds]]
*Manually Triggering Builds*

If the build does not start automatically, start a build and stream the logs:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc start-build ruby-ex --follow
----

Alternatively, do not include `--follow` in the above command, and instead issue
the following command after triggering the build, where `n` is the number of the
build to track:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs -f build/ruby-ex-n
----
