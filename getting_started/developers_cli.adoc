== Overview

This getting started experience walks you through the simplest way to get a
sample project up and running on {product-title}. There are a few different ways
to launch images within a project, but this topic focuses on the quickest and
easiest method.

If this is the first part of the documentation you have read, and you are
unfamiliar with the core concepts of {product-title} version 3 (v3), you might want to
start by reading about
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
xref:../release_notes/index.adoc#release-notes-index[what's new].
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
xref:../whats_new/index.adoc#whats-new-index[what's new].
endif::[]
This version of {product-title} is significantly different from version 2 (v2).

ifdef::openshift-online[]
Similar to xref:../getting_started/online_v2_vs_v3.adoc#getting-started-online-v2-vs-v3[{product-title} v2],
endif::[]
{product-title} 3 provides out of the box a set of
xref:../using_images/s2i_images/index.adoc#using-images-s2i-images-index[languages] and
xref:../using_images/db_images/index.adoc#using-images-db-images-index[databases] for developers with
corresponding implementations and tutorials that allow you to kickstart your
application development. Language support centers around the
xref:../dev_guide/app_tutorials/quickstarts.adoc#dev-guide-app-tutorials-quickstarts[Quickstart templates], which in
turn leverage xref:../using_images/s2i_images/index.adoc#using-images-s2i-images-index[builder images].

Other images provided by {product-title} include:

* https://github.com/openshift/mysql[MySQL]

* https://github.com/openshift/mongodb[MongoDB]

* https://github.com/openshift/postgresql[PostgreSQL]

* https://github.com/openshift/jenkins[Jenkins]

In addition, JBoss Middleware has put together a broad range of
https://github.com/jboss-openshift/application-templates[{product-title}
templates] as well as xref:../using_images/xpaas_images/index.adoc#using-images-xpaas-images-index[images] as
part of their xPaaS services.

The technologies available with the xPaaS services in particular include:

* Java EE 6 Application Server provided by JBoss EAP 6
* Integration and Messaging Services provided by JBoss Fuse and JBoss A-MQ
* Data Grid Service provided by JBoss Data Grid
* Real Time Decision Service provided by JBoss BRMS
* Java Web Server 3.0 provided by Tomcat 7 and Tomcat 8

With each of these offerings, a series of combinations are provided:

* HTTP only vs. HTTP and HTTPS
* No database required, or the use of either MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL
* If desired, integration with A-MQ

To help illustrate constructing such applications, the following sections guide
you through creating a project that contains a sample Node.js application that
will serve a welcome page and the current hit count (stored in a database).

[NOTE]
====
This topic discusses both
xref:../dev_guide/app_tutorials/quickstarts.adoc#dev-guide-app-tutorials-quickstarts[Quickstart] and
xref:../dev_guide/templates.adoc#using-the-instantapp-templates[Instant App]
templates and applications. Quickstarts provide a starting point for application
development, but they rely on your development to create a useful application.
In contrast, Instant Apps like Jenkins are instantly usable.

[[developers-cli-before-you-begin]]
== Before You Begin

Before you can get started:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
- You must be able to access a running instance of {product-title}. If you do
not have access, contact your cluster administrator.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-online[]
- You must register for an account with the https://openshift.com[{product-title} (Next Gen) Developer Preview.]
- Your project must be populated with the
xref:../dev_guide/templates.adoc#using-the-instantapp-templates[Instant App
templates] and xref:../using_images/s2i_images/index.adoc#using-images-s2i-images-index[builder images] that
conform to the current xref:../getting_started/devpreview_faq.adoc#getting-started-devpreview-faq[set of
considerations] for running in the {product-title} (Next Gen) Developer Preview
offering.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
- Your instance must be pre-configured by a cluster administrator with the
xref:../dev_guide/templates.adoc#using-the-instantapp-templates[Instant App templates]
and xref:../using_images/s2i_images/index.adoc#using-images-s2i-images-index[builder images]. If they
are not available,
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
direct your cluster administrator to the
xref:../install_config/imagestreams_templates.adoc#install-config-imagestreams-templates[Loading the Default Image Streams and Templates] topic.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
contact your cluster administrator.
endif::[]
- You must have an account on http://www.github.com[GitHub], have https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/[Git set up], and
https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/#next-steps-authenticating-with-github-from-git[set up authentication to GitHub from Git].
- You must have the {product-title} CLI
xref:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.adoc#cli-reference-get-started-cli[downloaded and installed].

// end::beforeyoubegin[]

// tag::forking[]

[[developers-cli-forking-the-sample-repository]]
== Forking the Sample Repository

. Visit the https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex[Node.js example] page while you are logged in to GitHub.
. https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[Fork the repository].
+
You are redirected to your new fork.
. Copy the clone URL for your fork.
. Clone the repository to your local machine.

// end::forking[]

[[developers-cli-creating-a-project]]
== Creating a Project

To create an application, you must create a new project and specify the location
of the source. From there, {product-title} begins the build process and creates
a new deployment.

. Log into {product-title} from the CLI:
+
* With username and password:
+
----
$ oc login -u=<username> -p=<password> --server=<your-openshift-server> --insecure-skip-tls-verify
----
+
* With oauth token:
+
----
$ oc login --token=<tokenID> --server=<https://api.your-openshift-server.com>
----
. To create a new project:
+
----
$ oc new-project <projectname> --description="<description>" --display-name="<display_name>"
----

After creating the new project, you will be automatically switched to the new
project namespace.

[[developers-cli-creating-an-application]]
== Creating an Application
To create a new application from the Instant App template
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
that you uploaded
endif::[]
:

----
$ oc new-app nodejs-mongodb-example
----

Your application is then created, which might take some time. In the case of
this template, MongoDB is created first, then the Node.js application is built
using the {product-title} source-to-image (S2I) builder.

You can follow along on the Overview page of the web console to see the new
resources being created, and watch the progress of the build and deployment.
While the MongoDB pod is being created, its status is shown as pending. The
MongoDB pod then starts up and displays its newly-assigned IP address.

When the Node.js pod is running, the build is complete.

You can also use the `oc get pods` command to check when the pod is up and
running.

The `oc status` command tells you what IP address the service is running; the
default port it deploys to is 8080.

== View the Running Application

To view your new application:

. Determine the service IP for the application:
+
----
$ oc get route
----
. Run the application:
+
----
$ curl <service-IP-address>:8080
----
. To view the application, browse to: http://<service-IP-address>:8080

include::getting_started/developers_console.adoc[tag=deploycode1]
. Modify the `*BuildConfig*` within the template to define the GitHub webhook
trigger.
. Specify a `*secret*` as part of the webhook. For example:
+
====

----
{
  "type": "github",
  "github": {
    "secret": "secret101"
  }
}
----
====
+
The secret ensures that only you and your repository can trigger the build.
. Run the following command to display the webhook URLs associated with your
`*BuildConfig*`:
+
----
$ oc describe buildConfig <name>
----
+
. Copy the webhook URL output by the above command. If the above command does not
display any webhook URLs, then no webhook trigger is defined for that build
configuration.
. Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub, then click *Settings*.
. Click *Webhooks & Services*.
. Click btn:[Add webhook].
. Paste your webhook URL into the *Payload URL* field.
. Click btn:[Add webhook] to save.

[[developers-cli-manually-rebuilding-images]]
=== Manually Rebuilding Images

You may find it useful to manually rebuild an image if your webhook is not
working, or if a build fails and you do not want to change the code before
restarting the build. To manually rebuild the image based on your latest
committed change to your forked repository:

----
$ oc start-build nodejs-ex
----

[[developers-cli-troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting

*Changing Projects*

Although the `oc new-project` command automatically sets your current project to
the one you've just created, you can always change projects by running:
----
$ oc project <project-name>
----

To view a list of projects:
----
$ oc get projects
----

*Manually Triggering Builds*

If the build does not start automatically, start a build and stream the logs:
----
$ oc start-build nodejs-ex --follow
----

Alternatively, do not include `--follow` in the above command, and instead issue
the following command after triggering the build, where `n` is the number of the
build to track:
----
$ oc logs -f build/nodejs-ex-n
----
