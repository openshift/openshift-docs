=== Browser Requirements

Review the
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-web-console[browser versions
and operating systems] that can be used to access the web console.

[[developers-console-creating-a-project]]
== Creating a Project

To create an application, you must first create a new project, then select an
InstantApp template. From there, {product-title} begins the build process and
creates a new deployment.

. Visit the {product-title} web console in your browser. The web console uses a self-signed certificate, so if prompted, continue past a browser warning.
. Log in using the username and password recommended to you by your administrator.
. To create a new project, click *New Project*.
. Type a unique name, display name, and description for the new project.
. Click *Create*.
+
The web console's welcome screen loads.

[[developers-console-creating-an-application]]
== Creating an Application

The Select Image or Template page gives you the option to create from a publicly
accessible git repository, or from a template:

. If creating a new project did not automatically redirect you to the Select Image or Template page, you might need to click *Add to Project*.
. Click *Browse*, then select *ruby* from the drop-down list.
. Click the *ruby:latest* builder image.
. Type a *name* for your application, and specify the *Git Repository URL*, which is `https://github.com/<your_github_username>/ruby-ex.git`.
. Optionally, click *Show advanced routing, build, and deployment options*, though by default this example application automatically creates a route, webhook trigger, and build change triggers.
. Click *Create*.
+
[NOTE]
====
After creation, some of these settings can be modified from the web console by clicking *Browse*, *Builds*, select your build, then click *Actions*, and either *Edit* or *Edit YAML*.
====

Creating your application might take some time. You can follow along on the
Overview page of the web console to see the new resources being created, and
watch the progress of the build and deployment.

While the Ruby pod is being created, its status is shown as pending. The Ruby
pod then starts up and displays its newly-assigned IP address. When the Ruby pod
is running, the build is complete.

[[developers-console-view-app]]
== Verify the Application is Running
If your DNS is correctly configured, then your new application can be accessed using a web browser. If you cannot access your application, then speak with your system administrator.

To view your new application:

. In the web console, view the overview page to determine the web address for the application. For example, under *SERVICE: RUBY-EX* you should see something similar to: `ruby-ex-my-test.example.openshiftapps.com`.
. Visit the web address for your new application.

[[developers-console-configure-auto-builds]]

// tag::deploycode1[]

== Configuring Automated Builds

You forked the source code for this application from the
https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex[{product-title} GitHub repository]. Therefore,
you can use a webhook to automatically trigger a rebuild of your application
whenever you push code changes to your forked repository.

To set up a webhook for your application:

// end::deploycode1[]

. From the Web Console, navigate to the project containing your application.
. Click the *Browse* tab, then click *Builds*.
. Click your build name, then click the *Configuration* tab.
. Click image:copy.jpg["Copy"] next to *GitHub webhook URL* to copy your webhook payload URL.
+
// tag::deploycode2[]
+
. Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub, then click *Settings*.
. Click *Webhooks & Services*.
. Click *Add webhook*.
. Paste your webhook URL into the *Payload URL* field.
. Click *Add webhook* to save.

GitHub now attempts to send a ping payload to your {product-title} server to ensure that communication is successful. If you see a green check mark appear next to your webhook URL, then it is correctly configured. Hover your mouse over the check mark to see the status of the last delivery.

The next time you push a code change to your forked repository, your application will automatically rebuild.

// end::deploycode2[]

[[developers-console-write-code-change]]

// tag::deploycode3[]

== Writing a Code Change

To work locally and then push changes to your application:

. On your local machine, use a text editor to change the sample application's source for the file *_ruby-ex/config.ru_*
. Make a code change that will be visible from within your application. For example: on line 229, change the title from `Welcome to your Ruby application on OpenShift` to `This is my Awesome OpenShift Application`, then save your changes.
. Commit the change in git, and push the change to your fork.
+
If your webhook is correctly configured, your application will immediately
rebuild itself based on your changes. Once the rebuild is successful, view your
updated application using the route that was created earlier.

Now going forward, all you need to do is push code updates and {product-title}
handles the rest.

// end::deploycode3[]

[[developers-console-manually-rebuild-images]]

=== Manually Rebuilding Images

You may find it useful to manually rebuild an image if your webhook is not
working, or if a build fails and you do not want to change the code before
restarting the build. To manually rebuild the image based on your latest
committed change to your forked repository:

. Click the *Browse* tab, then click *Builds*.
. Find your build, then click *Start Build*.
