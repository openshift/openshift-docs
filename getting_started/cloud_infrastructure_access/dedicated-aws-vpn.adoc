This sample process configures an Amazon Web Services (AWS) {product-title}
cluster to use a customer's on-site hardware VPN device.

[NOTE]
====
AWS VPN does not currently provide a managed option to apply NAT to VPN traffic.
See the
link:https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/configure-nat-for-vpn-traffic/[AWS Knowledge Center]
for more details.

[NOTE]
====
Routing all traffic, for example `0.0.0.0/0`, through a private connection is not supported. This requires deleting the internet gateway, which disables SRE management traffic.
