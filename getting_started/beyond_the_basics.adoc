== Overview

This getting started experience walks you through the “long way” of getting the
same sample project from the
xref:../getting_started/basic_walkthrough.adoc#getting-started-basic-walkthrough[Basic Walkthrough] topic up and
running on {product-title} {product-version}.

[NOTE]
====
If you are unfamiliar with the core concepts of {product-title} version 3, you
might want to start by reading about
xref:../getting_started/online_v2_vs_v3.adoc#getting-started-online-v2-vs-v3[what’s new]. This version of
{product-title} is significantly different from version 2.
====

The following sections guide you through creating a project that contains a
sample Node.js application that will serve a welcome page and the current hit
count (stored in a database). This
involves creating two xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#pods[pods]:

- one to host the Node.js application
- one to host the MongoDB database

The tutorial assumes that you have:

- a free {product-title} {product-version} account.
- a free https://github.com/[GitHub] account.
- https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/[Git] installed locally.

[[btb_setup]]
== Setup

In this section, you will _fork_ the {product-title} Node.js sample application
on GitHub and clone the repository to your local machine so that you can deploy
and edit the application.

[NOTE]
====
You can skip this step if you already forked the
https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex[*openshift/nodejs-ex*] repository when
following the xref:../getting_started/basic_walkthrough.adoc#getting-started-basic-walkthrough[Basic Walkthrough]
topic.
====

. On GitHub, navigate to the
https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex[*openshift/nodejs-ex*] repository. In the
top-right corner of the page, click *Fork*:
+
image::gs-fork.png[Fork the project]

. Next, execute the following commands on your local machine to clone the sample
application and change to the new directory:
+
----
$ git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/nodejs-ex
$ cd nodejs-ex
----

That's it! Now, you have a fork of the original *openshift/nodejs-ex* example
application Git repository and a copy on your local machine.

[[btb-installing-the-openshift-cli]]
== Installing the OpenShift CLI

In this section, you will install the {product-title} CLI. The {product-title}
CLI exposes commands for managing your applications, as well as lower level
tools to interact with each component of your system.

. First, download the {product-title} CLI from the *About* page in the
 {product-title} web console.
+
image::web_console_about.png[About page]
+
The CLI is available for Linux (32- or 64-bit), Mac OS X, and Windows. After you
have downloaded the CLI, return to these steps.

. Next, unpack or unzip the archive and move the `oc` binary to a directory on
your `*PATH*`.
+
[NOTE]
====
To check your `*PATH*` on Linux or Mac OS X, open the Terminal and run:

----
$ echo $PATH
----

To check it on Windows, open the Command Prompt and run:

----
C:\> path
----
====
+
After it is installed, you can use the `oc` command from your command shell.

. Then, visit the *About* page in the {product-title} web console.
+
image::web_console_about.png[About page]

. Copy the `oc login` command shown with your current session token to log in to
{product-title} from the CLI:
+
----
$ oc login https://<your_cluster_ID>.openshift.com --token=<your_session_token>
----
+
The `oc login` command is the best way to initially set up the {product-title}
CLI. The information is automatically saved in a CLI configuration file that is
then used for subsequent commands.

[[btb-creating-a-new-application-from-source-code]]
== Creating a New Application from Source Code

In this section, you will deploy your first application to {product-title} using
the web console.

. First, create a new project. Replace `<project_name>` below with a unique name
for your project, such as `<your_github_username>-example`:
+
----
$ oc new-project <project_name>
----
+
After creating the new project, you will be automatically switched to the new
project namespace.
+
If you followed the xref:../getting_started/basic_walkthrough.adoc#getting-started-basic-walkthrough[Basic
Walkthrough] topic, you already created your first project. You must switch to
your project namespace and clear out the original sample application.

.. Use the following command to find the name of your existing project(s):
+
----
$ oc get projects
----

.. Next, switch to your project namespace:
+
----
$ oc project <your_project_name>
----

.. Then, delete all existing objects in your project:
+
----
$ oc delete all --all
----

.. Use the following command to find the name of your existing persistent
volume claims:
+
----
$ oc get pvc
----

.. Finally, delete your existing persistent volume claims with:
+
----
$ oc delete pvc mongodb
----

. Next, create a new application from your forked copy of the *nodejs-ex* source
code file:
+
----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/<your_github_username>/nodejs-ex --name nodejs-mongodb-example
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `--name` option will apply a name of `nodejs-mongodb-example` to all the
resources created by the `oc new-app` command, for easy management later.
====
+
The tool will inspect the source code, locate an appropriate image that can
build the source code, create an
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[image
stream] for the new application image that will be built, then create the
correct
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#builds[build
configuration],
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configuration] and
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[service]
definition.
+
The `oc new-app` command kicks off a build after all required dependencies are
confirmed and automatically deploys the application after the image is
available.

[TIP]
====
You can follow along on the *Overview* page for your project in the web console
to see the new resource being created and watch the progress of the build and
deployment. When the Node.js pod is running, the build is complete.

You can also use the `oc status` command to check the status of your new nodejs
app, as well as `oc get pods` to check when the pod is up and running.

The `oc get services` command tells you what IP address the service is running;
the default port it deploys to is `8080`.
====

[[btb-configuring-routes]]
== Configuring Routes

In this section, you will configure a route to expose your Node.js service to
external requests.

. First, find your service name (which should be `nodejs-mongodb-example` with:
+
----
$ oc get services
----

. Next, create a route to expose your service to external requests:
+
----
$ oc expose service/nodejs-mongodb-example
----

. Now you can find the external host/port for your service with:
+
----
$ oc get routes
----

. Finally, copy the route *HOST/PORT* for your application and paste it in the
browser to view your application:
+
image::gs-running-nodejs-app.png[Running Node.js app]

[[btb-provisioning-a-database]]
== Provisioning a Database

In this section, you will add a MongoDB service to your project.

You may have noticed the `No database configured` under *Request information*
when you viewed the index page of your application. Let's fix that by adding a
MongoDB service.

. Add the {product-title}-provided MongoDB database to your project with:
+
----
$ oc new-app mongodb-persistent \
-p MONGODB_USER=admin \
-p MONGODB_PASSWORD=secret \
-p MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=super-secret
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `-p` flag sets the parameter values used by the *mongodb-persistent*
database template.
====

. Note the name of the MongoDB service before heading to the next
section.

[[btb-setting-environment-variables]]
== Setting Environment Variables

In this section, you will configure the Node.js service to connect to your new
MongoDB service.

. You must add the environment variable `*MONGO_URL*` to your Node.js web service
so that it will utilize the MongoDB service, and enable the "Page view count"
feature. Run:
+
----
$ oc set env dc/nodejs-mongodb-example
MONGO_URL='mongodb://admin:secret@<MongoDB-service-name>:27017/sampledb'
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Services in the same project have automatically resolvable DNS names.
====
+
For example:
+
----
$ oc set env dc/nodejs-mongodb-example
MONGO_URL='mongodb://admin:secret@mongodb-persistent:27017/sampledb'
----

. Next, run `oc status` to confirm that an updated deployment has been kicked off.
After the deployment completes, you will now have a Node.js welcome page showing
the current hit count, as stored in a MongoDB database.
+
[NOTE]
====
Use the following to get a list of environment variables set for all pods in the
project:

----
$ oc set env pods --all --list
----
====

[[btb-configuring-automated-builds]]
== Configuring Automated Builds

In this section, you will configure a GitHub webhook to automatically trigger a
rebuild of your application whenever you push code changes to your forked
repository.

. First, run the following command to display the webhook URLs associated with
your build configuration:
+
----
$ oc describe buildConfig nodejs-mongodb-example
----

. Copy the webhook GitHub URL output by the above command. The webhook URL will be
in the following format:
+
----
http://<openshift_api_host:port>/osapi/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/frontend/webhooks/<your_secret_key>/github
----

. Next, navigate to your forked repository on GitHub, then:
.. Click *Settings*.
.. Click *Webhooks & Services*.
.. Click *Add webhook*
.. Paste your webhook URL into the *Payload URL* field and click *Add webhook*
to save.

That’s it! Your application will now automatically rebuild when you push code
changes to your forked GitHub repository.

[[btb-pushing-a-code-change]]
== Pushing a Code Change

In this section, you will learn how to push a local code change to the
application.

. On your local machine, use a text editor to open the sample application’s source
for the file *_nodejs-ex/views/index.html_*.

. Make a code change that will be visible from within your application. For example, change the title on line 219:
+
image::gs-code-change.png[Make a code change]

. Commit the changes in Git, and push the change to your GitHub repository:
+
----
$ git add nodejs-ex/views/index.html
$ git commit -m "Updates heading on welcome page"
$ git push origin master
----

. If your webhook is correctly configured, your application will immediately
rebuild itself based on your changes. You can follow along on the *Overview*
page for your project in the web console to see watch the progress of the build
and deployment. View your application using a web browser to see your changes
once the deployment is completed.

Now all you need to do is push code updates, and {product-title} handles the
rest.
