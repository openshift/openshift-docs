== Overview

This guide demonstrates how to get a simple project up and running on
{product-title}.

The following sections guide you through creating a project that contains a
sample Node.js application that will serve a welcome page and the current hit
count (stored in a database) using the {product-title}
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-web-console[web
console]. This involves creating two
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#pods[pods]:

- one to host the Node.js application
- one to host the MongoDB database

The tutorial assumes that you have:

- an {product-title} account.
- a https://github.com/[GitHub] account.
- https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/[Git] installed locally.

[[bw-setup]]
== Setup

In this section, you will _fork_ the {product-title} Node.js sample application
on GitHub and clone the repository to your local machine so that you can deploy
and edit the application.

. On GitHub, navigate to the
https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex[*openshift/nodejs-ex*] repository. In the
top-right corner of the page, click *Fork*:
+

. Next, execute the following commands on your local machine to clone the sample
application and change to the new directory:
+
----
$ git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/nodejs-ex
$ cd nodejs-ex
----

That's it! Now, you have a fork of the original *openshift/nodejs-ex* example
application Git repository and a copy on your local machine.

[[bw-get-oriented-wth-the-web-console]]
== Get Oriented with the Web Console

Visit the
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-web-console[Web
Console] topic to learn about its components.

[[bw-creating-a-new-application]]
== Creating a New Application

In this section, you will deploy your first application to {product-title} using
the web console.

. Navigate to the welcome page of the {product-title} web console and click *Create
Project* to create your first project:
+
[NOTE]
====
{product-title} Starter only allows you to create a single project at this time.
If you already have a project, you must delete it in order to continue.

To delete your existing project, click the trash can icon next to the project
name on the welcome page:

image::gs-delete-projects.png[Delete projects]
====

. Replace `my-project` with a unique name for your project, such as
`<your_github_username>-example`. You can leave the display name and description
blank.
+
image::gs-new-project.png[New projects]

. Click on the *JavaScript* option:
+
image::console_select_image_or_template.png[Browse the catalog]

. Select the *nodejs-mongodb-example* Quickstart template:
+
image::gs-select-quickstart.png[Select Quickstart templates]

. On the next screen, replace the user name in the *Git Repository URL* parameter
with your GitHub user name. Use the default values provided for all other
parameters:
+
image::gs-change-git-url.png[Change Git URL]

. Finally, scroll to the bottom of the page and click *Create* to deploy your
application.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can follow along on the *Overview* page of the web console to see the new
resources being created, and watch the progress of the build and deployment.
While the MongoDB pod is being created, its status is shown as pending. The
MongoDB pod then starts up and displays its newly-assigned IP address.
====

[[bw-configuring-automated-builds]]
== Configuring Automated Builds

In this section, you will configure a GitHub webhook to automatically trigger a
rebuild of your application whenever you push code changes to your forked
repository. This involves adding the Github webhook URL from your application
into your Github repository. You obtain this webhook from these locations:

- At the bottom of *Next Steps* page shown after creating your app, you will see a
section titled *Making code changes*. Copy the payload URL from the bottom of
the page and follow the link to the GitHub project webhook settings page
provided:
+
image::gs-copy-webhook.png[Copy webhook]

- In the {product-title}  web console:
.. Navigate to the project containing your application.
.. Click the *Browse* tab, then click *Builds*, then click the name of the
build for your Node.js application.
.. From the *Configuration* tab, click image:copy.jpg[] next to *GitHub webhook
URL* to copy your GitHub webhook.

Next, add the webhook to the Github repository:

. In GitHub, click *Add webhook* in the GitHub Webhook settings for your project.
Paste the payload URL into the *Payload URL* field. Ensure *Content type* field
is set to *application/json* instead of the default
*application/x-www-form-urlencoded*. Then, click *Add webhook* to finish adding
the webhook to your project:
+
image::gs-add-webhook.png[Add webhook]

. GitHub now attempts to ping the {product-title} server to ensure that
communication is successful. If it is correctly configured, you will see a green
check mark next to your new webhook URL in GitHub. Hover your mouse over the
check mark to see the status of the last delivery:
+
image::gs-webhook-success.png[Successful delivery]

The next time you push a code change to your forked repository, your application
will automatically rebuild.

[[bw-viewing-your-running-application]]
== Viewing Your Running Application

In this section, you will view your running application using a web browser.

In the web console, view the *Overview* page for your project to determine the
web address for your application. Click the web address displayed underneath the
*NODEJS-MONGODB-EXAMPLE* service to open your application in a new browser tab:

image::gs-running-nodejs-app.png[Running Node.js app]

[NOTE]
====
You can find all routes configured for your project at any time in the web
console:

. From the web console, navigate to the project containing your application.
. Click the *Browse* tab, then click *Routes*.
. Click the host name to open your application in a browser new tab.
====

[[bw-pushing-a-code-change]]
== Pushing a Code Change

In this section, you will learn how to push a local code change to the
application.

. On your local machine, use a text editor to open the sample application’s source
for the file *_nodejs-ex/views/index.html_*.

. Make a code change that will be visible from within your application. For
example, change the title on line 219:
+
image::gs-code-change.png[Make a code change]

. Commit the changes in Git, and push the change to your GitHub repository:
+
----
$ git add views/index.html
$ git commit -m “Updates heading on welcome page”
$ git push origin master
----

. If your webhook is correctly configured, your application will immediately
rebuild itself based on your changes. View your application using a web browser
to see your changes.

Now going forward, all you need to do is push code updates and {product-title}
handles the rest.

[[bw-scaling-the-app]]
== Scaling the Application

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} Starter users are unable to scale applications. Only
{product-title} Pro users have this ability.
====

In this section, you will add additional instances of your Node.js service so
that your application can handle additional traffic volume.

. In the web console, view the *Overview* page for your project. Click the up
arrow under the *NODEJS-MONGODB-EXAMPLE* service to add an additional replica of
your Node.js application:
+
image::gs-scaling-app.png[Scaling an app]

The *nodejs-mongodb-example* Quickstart is configured to use 512 MiB of memory
per pod. Your {product-title} Pro quota will allow up to 3 replicas of the *nodejs-mongodb-example*
pod in addition to the MongoDB database (for a total of 2 GiB).

You can check your quota usage at any time in the web console:

. From the web console, navigate to the project containing your application.
. Click the *Settings* tab and scroll to the section titled *Quota
compute-resources* to view usage:

image::gs-quota.png[Quota]

[[bw-next-up]]
== Next Up: Beyond the Basics

Next, we’ll go xref:../getting_started/beyond_the_basics.adoc#getting-started-beyond-the-basics[beyond the basics]
using the {product-title} CLI to compose this same application using individual
images.
