{product-title} is a cloud-based Kubernetes container platform. The foundation of {product-title} is based on Kubernetes and therefore shares the same technology. It is designed to allow applications and the data centers that support them to expand from just a few machines and applications to thousands of machines that serve millions of clients.

{product-title} enables you to do the following:

* Provide developers and IT organizations with cloud application platforms that can be used for deploying applications on secure and scalable resources.
* Require minimal configuration and management overhead.
* Bring the Kubernetes platform to customer data centers and cloud.
* Meet security, privacy, compliance, and governance requirements.

With its foundation in Kubernetes, {product-title} incorporates the same technology that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming video, gaming, banking, and other applications. Its implementation in open Red Hat technologies lets you extend your containerized applications beyond a single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments.

== Installing {product-title}

The {product-title} installation program offers you flexibility. You can use the installation program to deploy a cluster on infrastructure that the installation program provisions and the cluster maintains or deploy a cluster on infrastructure that you prepare and maintain.

For more information about the installation process, the supported platforms, and choosing a method of installing and preparing your cluster, see the following:
