[[access-your-cluster-overview]]
== Accessing your cluster

Once your {product-title} cluster is configured and ready to use, you can access
it through the following paths:

* *Cluster ID*: The unique cluster name provided by the customer during provisioning. It is lowercase, and only contains letters, numbers, and hyphens.

* *Console URL*: The {product-title} URL for the
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-web-console[web
console].
+
----
https://console.<cluster-id>.openshift.com
----

* *API URL*: The {product-title} URL for the OpenShift and Kubernetes
xref:../rest_api/index.adoc#rest-api-index[REST API].
+
----
https://api.<cluster-id>.openshift.com
----

* *Registry URL*: The {product-title} URL for the private
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-image-registry[image
registry]. In addition to containing all images used by {product-title}, `docker
pull` and `docker push` can be used directly on the registry.
+
----
https://registry.<cluster-id>.openshift.com
----

* *Metrics API URL*: The {product-title} URL for the
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.9/install_config/cluster_metrics.html#cluster-metrics-accessing-hawkular-metrics-directly[Hawkular
Metrics API].
+
----
https://metrics.<cluster-id>.openshift.com
----

* *Logging URL*: The {product-title} URL for the aggregate logging Kibana interface.
+
----
https://logs.<cluster-id>.openshift.com
----

* If an authentication callback URL is necessary, you can configure it with:
+
----
https://api.<cluster-id>.openshift.com/oauth2callback/<IdP name>

[[configuring-your-application-routes]]
== Configuring your application routes

When your cluster is provisioned, an AWS elastic load balancer (ELB) is created
to route application traffic into the cluster. The domain for your ELB is
configured to route application traffic via
`http(s)://*.<shard-id>.<cluster-id>.openshiftapps.com`. The `<shard-id>` is a
four-character string that is communicated to you after initial provisioning.

If you want to use custom domain names for your application routes, you should
set up a CNAME record in your DNS host to point to
*_elb.<shard-id>.<cluster-id>.openshiftapps.com_*. While `elb` is recommended as a
reminder for where this record is pointing, you can use any string for this
value. You can create these CNAME records for each custom route you have, or you
can create a wildcard CNAME record. For example:

----
*.openshift.example.com    CNAME    elb.1234.my-example.openshiftapps.com
----

This allows you to create routes like *_app1.openshift.example.com_* and
*_app2.openshift.example.com_* without having to update your DNS every time.

Customers with configured VPC peering or VPN connections have the option of
requesting a second ELB, so that application routes can be configured as
internal-only or externally available. The domain for this ELB will be identical
to the first, with a different `<shard-id>` value. By default, application
routes are handled by the internal-only router. To expose an application or
service externally, you must create a new route with a specific label,
`route=external`.

To expose a new route for an existing service, apply the label `route=external`
and define a host name that contains the secondary, public router shard ID:

----
$ oc expose service <service-name> -l route=external --name=<custom-route-name> --hostname=<custom-hostname>.<shard-id>.<cluster-id>.openshiftapps.com
----

Alternatively, you can use a custom domain:

----
$ oc expose service <service-name> -l route=external --name=<custom-route-name> --hostname=<custom-domain>
----

[[access-your-cluster-status-updates]]
== Receive status updates

Access the status portal at link:https://status-dedicated.openshift.com[]. You
can also subscribe to notifications via email, SMS, or RSS by changing your
preferences in the status portal.

[[access-your-cluster-support]]
== Request support

If you have questions about your environment or need to open a support ticket,
you can open or view a support case in the
link:https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/list[Red Hat Customer
Portal].

[[access-your-cluster-next-steps]]
== Next steps

You can download the {product-title} command line tools from your clusterâ€™s
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#web-console-cli-downloads[web
console]. For help getting started with command line tools, see the
xref:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.adoc#cli-reference-get-started-cli[Get
Started with the CLI guide]. You can also visit the
xref:../getting_started/developers_console.adoc#getting-started-developers-console[Getting
Started Guide for developers].

Dedicated administrators should view the
xref:../admin_guide/index.adoc#admin-guide-index[Cluster Administration
Overview] for detailed information on available roles and permissions. This
section also includes important topics such as
xref:../admin_guide/quota.adoc#admin-guide-quota[managing
quotas] and xref:../admin_guide/service_accounts.adoc#admin-guide-service-accounts[configuring service
accounts].

If your cluster has been configured with the
xref:../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#admin-guide-networking-networkpolicy[NetworkPolicy
SDN], {product-title} administrators are able to create and modify NetworkPolicy
objects. NetworkPolicy, by default, allows traffic communication between
projects. Denying traffic between projects can be enabled by the creation of two
xref:../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#admin-guide-networking-networkpolicy-setting-default[NetworkPolicy
objects].
