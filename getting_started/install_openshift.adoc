[[install-overview]]
== Overview

This guide introduces you to the basic concepts of {product-title}, and helps
you install a basic application. This guide is not suitable for deploying or
installing a production environment of {product-title}.

[[install-prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites

To install {product-title}, you will need:

* At least two physical or virtual RHEL 7+ machines, with fully qualified domain
names (either real world or within a network) and xref:../getting_started/install_openshift.adoc#set-up-password-less-ssh[password-less SSH] access to
each other. This guide uses `master.openshift.example.com` and
`node.openshift.example.com`. These machines must be able to ping each other
using these domain names. If you use IBM POWER servers, all servers in your
cluster must be IBM POWER servers.
* A valid Red Hat subscription.
* Wildcard DNS resolution that resolves your domain to the IP of the node. So,
an entry like the following in your DNS server:
+
----
master.openshift.example.com. 300 IN A <master_ip>
node.openshift.example.com. 300 IN A <node_ip>
*.apps.openshift.example.com. 300 IN A <node_ip>
----

[NOTE]
.Why the *apps* in your domain name for the wildcard entry?
====
When using {product-title} to deploy applications, an internal router needs to proxy
incoming requests to the corresponding application pod. By using *apps* as part
of the application domains, the application traffic is accurately marked to the
right pod.

You can use anything other than *apps*.

----
*.cloudapps.openshift.example.com. 300 IN A <node_ip>
----
====

Once these are configured, use the following steps to set up a two-machine
{product-title} install.

[[attach-subscription]]
=== Attach {product-title} Subscription

. As root on the target machines (both master and node), use
`subscription-manager` to register the systems with Red Hat.
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager register
----

. Pull the latest subscription data from Red Hat Subscription Manager (RHSM):
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager refresh
----

. List the available subscriptions.
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager list --available
----

. Find the pool ID that provides {product-title} subscription and attach it.
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id>
----

. Replace the string `<pool_id>` with the pool ID of the pool that provides
{product-title}. The pool ID is a long alphanumeric string.

These RHEL systems are now authorized to install {product-title}. Now you need
to tell the systems from where to get {product-title}.

[[set-up-repositories]]
=== Set Up Repositories

On both master and node, use `subscription-manager` to enable the repositories
that are necessary in order to install {product-title}. You may have already enabled
the first two repositories in this example.

* For cloud installations and on-premise installations on x86_64 servers,
run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager repos --enable="rhel-7-server-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.11-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ansible-2.9-rpms"
----
* For on-premise installations on IBM POWER8 servers, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager repos \
    --enable="rhel-7-for-power-le-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-for-power-le-extras-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-for-power-le-optional-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ansible-2.9-for-power-le-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-for-power-le-rhscl-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-for-power-le-ose-3.11-rpms"

----
* For on-premise installations on IBM POWER9 servers, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# subscription-manager repos \
    --enable="rhel-7-for-power-9-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-for-power-9-extras-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-for-power-9-optional-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ansible-2.9-for-power-9-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-for-power-9-rhscl-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-for-power-9-ose-3.11-rpms"
----

This command tells your RHEL system that the tools required to install
{product-title} will be available from these repositories. Now we need the
{product-title} installer that is based on Ansible.

[NOTE]
====
Older versions of {product-title} 3.11 supported only Ansible 2.6. The most
recent versions of the playbooks now support Ansible 2.9, which is the
preferred version to use.
====

[[install-package]]
=== Install the {product-title} Package

The installer for {product-title} is provided by the
*openshift-ansible* package. Install it using `yum` on the master after running `yum update`.

[source,terminal]
----
# yum -y install wget git net-tools bind-utils iptables-services bridge-utils bash-completion kexec-tools sos psacct
----

[source,terminal]
----
# yum -y update
----

[source,terminal]
----
# reboot
----

[source,terminal]
----
# yum -y install openshift-ansible
----

Now install a container engine:

* To install CRI-O:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# yum -y install cri-o
----
* To install Docker:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# yum -y install docker
----

[[set-up-password-less-ssh]]
=== Set up Password-less SSH Access

Before running the installer on the master, set up password-less SSH access as
this is required by the installer to gain access to the machines. On the master,
run the following command.

[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh-keygen
----

Follow the prompts and just hit enter when asked for pass phrase.

An easy way to distribute your SSH keys is by using a `bash` loop:

[source,terminal]
----
$ for host in master.openshift.example.com \
    node.openshift.example.com; \
    do ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub $host; \
    done
----

[[run-the-installation-playbooks]]
=== Run the Installation Playbooks

. See
xref:../install/example_inventories.adoc#install-config-example-inventories[Example
Inventory Files] and select the example that most closely matches your desired cluster
configuration.
+

[IMPORTANT]
====
Running Ansible playbooks with the `--tags` or `--check` options is not supported by Red Hat.
====

[NOTE]
====
Further example host files are available as references in the
*_/usr/share/doc/openshift-ansible-docs-3.11.<version>/docs/example-inventories/_*
directory (replacing `<version>` with your latest installed version of the
*openshift-ansible-docs* package, which will update over time as the
*openshift-ansible* parent package is upgraded). See
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#install-config-configuring-inventory-file[Configuring Your Inventory File]
for full documentation on available inventory variables.
====

. Edit the example inventory to use your host names, and then save it to a file.
The default location is *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*.

. Change to the playbook directory and run the *_prerequisites.yml_* playbook using your inventory file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> playbooks/prerequisites.yml
----

. Change to the playbook directory and run the *_deploy_cluster.yml_* playbook using your inventory file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> playbooks/deploy_cluster.yml
----

After a successful install, but before you add a new project, you must set up
basic authentication, user access, and routes.

[[interact-with-openshift]]
== Interact with {product-title}

{product-title} provides two command line utilities to interact with it.

* `oc`: for normal project and application management
* `oc adm`: for administrative tasks
+
include::getting_started/configure_openshift.adoc[tag=ocadm-note]

Use `oc --help` and `oc adm --help` to view all available options.

In addition, you can use the web console to manage projects and applications.
The web console is available at `\https://<master_fqdn>:8443/console`. In the
next section, you will see how to create user accounts for accessing the
console.

[NOTE]
====
You can interact with your {product-title} instance from a remote system as well,
using these command line utilities. Bundled as the OpenShift CLI, you can
download these utilities for Windows, Mac, or Linux environments in the
xref:../cli_reference/index.adoc#cli-reference-index[CLI Reference] section.
====

[[roles-and-authentication]]
== Understand Roles and Authentication

By default, when installed for the first time, there are no roles or user
accounts created in {product-title}, so you need to create them. You have the
option to either create new roles or define a policy that allows anyone to log
in (to start you off).

Before you do anything else, log in at least one time with the default
*system:admin* user. On the master, run the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login -u system:admin
----

NOTE: All commands from now on should be executed on the master, unless
otherwise indicated.

By logging in at least one time with this account, you will create the
*system:admin* user's configuration file, which will allow you to log in
subsequently.

There is no password for this system account.

Run the following command to verify that {product-title} was installed and
started successfully. You will get a listing of the master and node, in the
`Ready` status.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----

To continue configuring your basic {product-title} environment, follow the steps outlined in xref:../getting_started/configure_openshift.adoc#getting-started-configure-openshift[Configure {product-title}].
