{product-title} includes a preconfigured, preinstalled, and self-updating monitoring stack that provides monitoring for core platform components. You also have the option to xref:../../observability/monitoring/enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects.adoc#enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects[enable monitoring for user-defined projects].

A cluster administrator can xref:../../observability/monitoring/configuring-the-monitoring-stack.adoc#configuring-the-monitoring-stack[configure the monitoring stack] with the supported configurations. {product-title} delivers monitoring best practices out of the box.

A set of alerts are included by default that immediately notify administrators about issues with a cluster. Default dashboards in the {product-title} web console include visual representations of cluster metrics to help you to quickly understand the state of your cluster. With the {product-title} web console, you can xref:../../observability/monitoring/managing-metrics.adoc#managing-metrics[view and manage metrics], xref:../../observability/monitoring/managing-alerts.adoc#managing-alerts[alerts], and xref:../../observability/monitoring/reviewing-monitoring-dashboards.adoc#reviewing-monitoring-dashboards[review monitoring dashboards].

In the *Observe* section of {product-title} web console, you can access and manage monitoring features such as xref:../../observability/monitoring/managing-metrics.adoc#managing-metrics[metrics], xref:../../observability/monitoring/managing-alerts.adoc#managing-alerts[alerts], xref:../../observability/monitoring/reviewing-monitoring-dashboards.adoc#reviewing-monitoring-dashboards[monitoring dashboards], and xref:../../observability/monitoring/managing-metrics.adoc#getting-detailed-information-about-a-target_managing-metrics[metrics targets].

After installing {product-title}, cluster administrators can optionally enable monitoring for user-defined projects. By using this feature, cluster administrators, developers, and other users can specify how services and pods are monitored in their own projects.
As a cluster administrator, you can find answers to common problems such as user metrics unavailability and high consumption of disk space by Prometheus in xref:../../observability/monitoring/troubleshooting-monitoring-issues.adoc#troubleshooting-monitoring-issues[Troubleshooting monitoring issues].

In {product-title}, you can monitor your own projects in isolation from Red Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) platform metrics. You can monitor your own projects without the need for an additional monitoring solution.
