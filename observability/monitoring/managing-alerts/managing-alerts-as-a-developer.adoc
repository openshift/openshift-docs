The alerts, silences, and alerting rules that are available in the Alerting UI relate to the projects that you have access to.

== Managing silences

You can create a silence for an alert in the {product-title} web console in the *Developer* perspective.
After you create silences, you can view, edit, and expire them. You also do not receive notifications about a silenced alert when the alert fires.

[NOTE]
====
When you create silences, they are replicated across Alertmanager pods. However, if you do not configure persistent storage for Alertmanager, silences might be lost. This can happen, for example, if all Alertmanager pods restart at the same time.

== Managing alerting rules for user-defined projects

In {product-title}, you can create, view, edit, and remove alerting rules for user-defined projects. Those alerting rules will trigger alerts based on the values of the chosen metrics.
