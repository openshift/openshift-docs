In {product-title}, the Alerting UI enables you to manage alerts, silences, and alerting rules.

[NOTE]
====
The alerts, silences, and alerting rules that are available in the Alerting UI relate to the projects that you have access to. For example, if you are logged in as a user with the `cluster-admin` role, you can access all alerts, silences, and alerting rules.

== Managing silences

You can create a silence for an alert in the {product-title} web console in the *Administrator* perspective.
After you create silences, you can view, edit, and expire them. You also do not receive notifications about a silenced alert when the alert fires.

[NOTE]
====
When you create silences, they are replicated across Alertmanager pods. However, if you do not configure persistent storage for Alertmanager, silences might be lost. This can happen, for example, if all Alertmanager pods restart at the same time.

[id="managing-alerting-rules-for-core-platform-monitoring_{context}"]
== Managing alerting rules for core platform monitoring

The {product-title} monitoring includes a large set of default alerting rules for platform metrics.
As a cluster administrator, you can customize this set of rules in two ways:

* Modify the settings for existing platform alerting rules by adjusting thresholds or by adding and modifying labels.
For example, you can change the `severity` label for an alert from `warning` to `critical` to help you route and triage issues flagged by an alert.

* Define and add new custom alerting rules by constructing a query expression based on core platform metrics in the `openshift-monitoring` project.

== Managing alerting rules for user-defined projects

In {product-title}, you can create, view, edit, and remove alerting rules for user-defined projects. Those alerting rules will trigger alerts based on the values of the chosen metrics.
