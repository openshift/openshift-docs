As a cluster administrator, you can optionally enable monitoring for user-defined projects in addition to core platform monitoring.
Non-administrator users such as developers can then monitor their own projects outside of core platform monitoring.

Cluster administrators typically complete the following activities to configure user-defined projects so that users can view collected metrics, query these metrics, and receive alerts for their own projects:
