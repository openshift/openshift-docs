The {product-title} installation program provides only a low number of configuration options before installation. Configuring most {product-title} framework components, including the cluster monitoring stack, happens after the installation.

This section explains which monitoring components can be configured and how to prepare for configuring the monitoring stack.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Not all configuration parameters for the monitoring stack are exposed.
Only the parameters and fields listed in the xref:../../../observability/monitoring/config-map-reference-for-the-cluster-monitoring-operator.adoc#cluster-monitoring-operator-configuration-reference[Config map reference for the {cmo-full}] are supported for configuration.

* The monitoring stack imposes additional resource requirements. Consult the computing resources recommendations in xref:../../../scalability_and_performance/recommended-performance-scale-practices/recommended-infrastructure-practices.adoc#scaling-cluster-monitoring-operator_recommended-infrastructure-practices[Scaling the {cmo-full}] and verify that you have sufficient resources.

== Preparing to configure the monitoring stack

You can configure core platform monitoring by creating and updating the `cluster-monitoring-config` config map. This config map configures the {cmo-first}, which in turn configures the components of the default monitoring stack.
