{product-title} includes a preconfigured, preinstalled, and self-updating monitoring stack that provides monitoring for core platform components. After installing {product-title}, cluster administrators can optionally enable monitoring for user-defined projects. By using this feature, cluster administrators, developers, and other users can specify how services and pods are monitored in their own projects.

[NOTE]
====
The monitoring stack documentation is available as a separate documentation set at link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/monitoring_stack_for_red_hat_openshift/latest[Monitoring stack for Red Hat OpenShift].
