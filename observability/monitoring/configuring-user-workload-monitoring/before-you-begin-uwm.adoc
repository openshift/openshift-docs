This section explains which user-defined monitoring components can be configured, how to enable monitoring for user-defined projects, and how to prepare for configuring the user-defined monitoring stack.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Not all configuration parameters for the monitoring stack are exposed.
Only the parameters and fields listed in the xref:../../../observability/monitoring/config-map-reference-for-the-cluster-monitoring-operator.adoc#cluster-monitoring-operator-configuration-reference[Config map reference for the {cmo-full}] are supported for configuration.

* The monitoring stack imposes additional resource requirements. Consult the computing resources recommendations in xref:../../../scalability_and_performance/recommended-performance-scale-practices/recommended-infrastructure-practices.adoc#scaling-cluster-monitoring-operator_recommended-infrastructure-practices[Scaling the {cmo-full}] and verify that you have sufficient resources.

== Enabling monitoring for user-defined projects

In {product-title}, you can enable monitoring for user-defined projects in addition to the default platform monitoring. You can monitor your own projects in {product-title} without the need for an additional monitoring solution. Using this feature centralizes monitoring for core platform components and user-defined projects.
