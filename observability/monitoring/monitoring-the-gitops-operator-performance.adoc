= Monitoring the {gitops-shortname} Operator performance
:context: monitoring-the-gitops-operator-performance

toc::[]

The {gitops-title} Operator emits metrics about its performance. With the OpenShift monitoring stack that picks up these metrics, you can monitor and analyze the Operator’s performance. The Operator exposes the following metrics, which you can view by using the {OCP} web console:

.{gitops-shortname} Operator performance metrics
[options="header"]
|===
|Metric name |Type |Description

|`active_argocd_instances_total` |Gauge |The total number of active Argo CD instances currently managed by the Operator across the cluster at a given time.

|`active_argocd_instances_by_phase` |Gauge |The number of active Argo CD instances in a given phase, such as pending, or available.

|`active_argocd_instance_reconciliation_count` |Counter |The total number of reconciliations that have occurred for an instance in a given namespace at any given time.

|`controller_runtime_reconcile_time_seconds_per_instance_bucket` |Counter |The number of reconciliation cycles completed under given time durations for an instance. For example, `controller_runtime_reconcile_time_seconds_per_instance_bucket{le="0.5"}` shows the number of reconciliations that took under 0.5 seconds to complete for a given instance.

|`controller_runtime_reconcile_time_seconds_per_instance_count` |Counter |The total number of reconciliation cycles observed for a given instance.

|`controller_runtime_reconcile_time_seconds_per_instance_sum`|Counter |The total amount of time taken for the observed reconciliations for a given instance.
