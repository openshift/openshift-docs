After {product-title} is installed, core platform monitoring components immediately begin collecting metrics, which you can query and view.
The default in-cluster monitoring stack includes the core platform Prometheus instance that collects metrics from your cluster and the core Alertmanager instance that routes alerts, among other components.
Depending on who will use the monitoring stack and for what purposes, as a cluster administrator, you can further configure these monitoring components to suit the needs of different users in various scenarios.

In addition to core platform monitoring, you can also optionally xref:../monitoring/enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects.adoc#enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects[enable monitoring for user-defined projects] for user workload monitoring.
Users can then monitor their own services and workloads without the need for an additional monitoring solution.

== Configuring core platform monitoring: Postinstallation steps

After {product-title} is installed, cluster administrators typically configure core platform monitoring to suit their needs.
These activities include setting up storage and configuring options for Prometheus, Alertmanager, and other monitoring components.

[NOTE]
====
By default, in a newly installed {product-title} system, users can query and view collected metrics.
You need only configure an alert receiver if you want users to receive alert notifications.
Any other configuration options listed here are optional.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* In multi-node clusters, you must configure persistent storage for Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Thanos Ruler to ensure high availability.

With the monitoring stack configured to suit your needs, Prometheus collects metrics from the specified services and stores these metrics according to your settings.

== Configuring monitoring for user-defined projects: Getting started

As a cluster administrator, you can optionally enable monitoring for user-defined projects in addition to core platform monitoring.
Non-administrator users such as developers can then monitor their own projects outside of core platform monitoring.

Cluster administrators typically complete the following activities to configure user-defined projects so that users can view collected metrics, query these metrics, and receive alerts for their own projects:

* xref:../../observability/monitoring/enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects.adoc#enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects_enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects[Enable user-defined projects].
* xref:../../observability/monitoring/enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects.adoc#granting-users-permission-to-monitor-user-defined-projects_enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects[Assign the `monitoring-rules-view`, `monitoring-rules-edit`, or `monitoring-edit` cluster roles] to grant non-administrator users permissions to monitor user-defined projects.
* xref:../../observability/monitoring/enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects.adoc#granting-users-permission-to-configure-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects_enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects[Assign the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role] to grant non-administrator users permission to configure user-defined projects.
* xref:../../observability/monitoring/enabling-alert-routing-for-user-defined-projects.adoc#enabling-alert-routing-for-user-defined-projects[Enable alert routing for user-defined projects] so that developers and other users can configure custom alerts and alert routing for their projects.
* If needed, configure alert routing for user-defined projects to xref:../../observability/monitoring/enabling-alert-routing-for-user-defined-projects.adoc#enabling-a-separate-alertmanager-instance-for-user-defined-alert-routing_enabling-alert-routing-for-user-defined-projects[use an optional Alertmanager instance dedicated for use only by user-defined projects].
* xref:../../observability/monitoring/managing-alerts.adoc#configuring-different-alert-receivers-for-default-platform-alerts-and-user-defined-alerts_managing-alerts[Configure alert receivers] for user-defined projects.
* xref:../../observability/monitoring/managing-alerts.adoc#configuring-notifications-for-user-defined-alerts_managing-alerts[Configure notifications for user-defined alerts].

After monitoring for user-defined projects is enabled and configured, developers and other non-administrator users can then perform the following activities to set up and use monitoring for their own projects:

* xref:../../observability/monitoring/managing-metrics.adoc#setting-up-metrics-collection-for-user-defined-projects_managing-metrics[Deploy and monitor services].
* xref:../../observability/monitoring/managing-alerts.adoc#creating-alerting-rules-for-user-defined-projects_managing-alerts[Create and manage alerting rules].
* xref:../../observability/monitoring/managing-alerts.adoc#managing-alerts[Receive and manage alerts] for their projects.
* If granted the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role, xref:../../observability/monitoring/managing-alerts.adoc#creating-alert-routing-for-user-defined-projects_managing-alerts[configure alert routing].
* Use the {product-title} web console to xref:../../observability/monitoring/reviewing-monitoring-dashboards.adoc#reviewing-monitoring-dashboards-developer_reviewing-monitoring-dashboards[view dashboards].
* xref:../../observability/monitoring/managing-metrics.adoc#querying-metrics-for-user-defined-projects-as-a-developer_managing-metrics[Query the collected metrics] by creating PromQL queries or using predefined queries.
