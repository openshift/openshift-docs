[role="_abstract"]
In {product-title} {product-version}, you can access web service APIs for some monitoring components from the command line interface (CLI).

[IMPORTANT]
====
In certain situations, accessing API endpoints can degrade the performance and scalability of your cluster, especially if you use endpoints to retrieve, send, or query large amounts of metrics data.

To avoid these issues, follow these recommendations:

* Avoid querying endpoints frequently. Limit queries to a maximum of one every 30 seconds.
* Do not try to retrieve all metrics data via the `/federate` endpoint for Prometheus. Query it only when you want to retrieve a limited, aggregated data set. For example, retrieving fewer than 1,000 samples for each request helps minimize the risk of performance degradation.
