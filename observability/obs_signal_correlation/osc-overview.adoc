Many observability tools and observable systems use their own unique data models, storage technologies, query languages, and related nomenclature.

The differences between these nomenclatures can make it difficult for users to recognize relationships between different Kubernetes cluster resources. As a result, troubleshooting and identifying resources affected by issues in your cluster can be time consuming and difficult.

{osc-full-upper} is a correlation engine for observable signals that relates Kubernetes objects to different types of signal data. Given a _start_ object, {osc-short-lower} searches for a chain of rules to related _goal_ objects. {osc-short-upper} can also show the _neighbourhood_ of all data related to an object of interest.

A REST API can be used by clients to make correlation queries. The REST API can be deployed as a service in a cluster, or run outside the cluster and connect to signal stores inside the cluster.

Signal data can be stored in separate signal stores, and encoded using different schema.
