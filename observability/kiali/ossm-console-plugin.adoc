== Installing {sm-plugin-full}

You can install the {SMPluginShort} with the Kiali Operator by creating a `OSSMConsole` resource with the corresponding plugin settings. It is recommended to install the latest version of the Kiali Operator, even while installing a previous {SMPluginShort} version, as it includes the latest z-stream release.

== Uninstalling {sm-plugin-full}

You can uninstall the {SMPluginShort} by using the {ocp-product-title} web console or the {oc-first}.

You must uninstall the {SMPluginShort} before removing the Kiali Operator. Deleting the Operator first may leave OSSMC and Kiali CRs stuck, requiring manual removal of the finalizer. Use the following command with `<custom_resource_type>` as `kiali` or `ossmconsole` to remove the finalizer, if needed:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch <custom_resource_type> <custom_resource_name> -n <custom_resource_namespace> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers": []}}' --type=merge
