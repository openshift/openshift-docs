Metrics enable cluster administrators to monitor how {ServerlessProductName} cluster components and workloads are performing.

You can view different metrics for {ServerlessProductName} by navigating to link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html-single/monitoring/index#about-monitoring-dashboards_key-concepts[*About monitoring dashboards*].

== Prerequisites

* See the {ocp-product-title} documentation on link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/observability/monitoring/managing-metrics.html[Managing metrics] for information about enabling metrics for your cluster.

* You have access to an account with cluster administrator access (or dedicated administrator access for {dedicated-product-title} or {rosa-product-title}).

[WARNING]
====
If {SMProductShortName} is enabled with mTLS, metrics for Knative Serving are disabled by default because Service Mesh prevents Prometheus from scraping metrics.

For information about resolving this issue, see xref:../../integrations/serverless-integrating-service-mesh/serverless-ossm-setup.adoc#serverless-ossm-enabling-serving-metrics_serverless-ossm-setup[Enabling Knative Serving metrics when using Service Mesh with mTLS].

Scraping the metrics does not affect autoscaling of a Knative service, because scraping requests do not go through the activator. Consequently, no scraping takes place if no pods are running.
