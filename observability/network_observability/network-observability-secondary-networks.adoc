You can configure the Network Observability Operator to collect and enrich network flow data from secondary networks, such as `SR-IOV` and `OVN-Kubernetes`.

// Note to tech review:
// Is the existing SR-IOV example we have, "Configuring monitoring for SR-IOV interface traffic", an example of secondary network? If so, it is not through a VM, right?

[NOTE]
====
The following topologies are supported:

* MACVLAN
* Layer 2
* Bridge CNI
* localnet
