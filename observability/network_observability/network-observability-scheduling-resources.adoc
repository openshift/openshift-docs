Taints and tolerations allow the node to control which pods should (or should not) be scheduled on them. 

A node selector specifies a map of key/value pairs that are defined using custom labels on nodes and selectors specified in pods.

For the pod to be eligible to run on a node, the pod must have the same key/value node selector as the label on the node.
