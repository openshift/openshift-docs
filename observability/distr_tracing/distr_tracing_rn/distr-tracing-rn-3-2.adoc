=== Bug fixes

This update introduces the following bug fixes for the {TempoShortName}:

* Before, the Jaeger UI only displayed services that have sent traces in the last 15 minutes. Now the availability of the service and operation names is configurable via `spec.template.queryFrontend.jaegerQuery.servicesQueryDuration`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3139[TRACING-3139])
* Before this update, the query-frontend pod could be out-of-memory (OOM) killed when a large trace was searched. Now the resource limits can be specified to overcome the issue (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-4009[TRACING-4009])

[id="distributed-tracing-rn_3-2_jaeger-release-notes_deprecated-functionality"]
=== Deprecated functionality

In the {DTProductName} 3.2, Jaeger and support for Elasticsearch remain deprecated, and both are planned to be removed in a future release. Red Hat will provide critical and above CVE bug fixes and support for these components during the current release lifecycle, but these components will no longer receive feature enhancements.

In the {DTProductName} 3.2, Tempo provided by the {TempoOperator} and the OpenTelemetry Collector provided by the {OTELName} are the preferred Operators for distributed tracing collection and storage. The OpenTelemetry and Tempo distributed tracing stack is to be adopted by all users because this will be the stack that will be enhanced going forward.

In the {DTProductName} 3.2, Jaeger agent is deprecated and it will be removed in the following release. The OpenTelemetry Collector provided by the {OTELName} is the preferred Operators for injecting trace collector agent.
