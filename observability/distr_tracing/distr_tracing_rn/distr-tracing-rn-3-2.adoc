=== Bug fixes

This update introduces the following bug fixes:

* Before this update, the Jaeger UI only displayed services that sent traces in the previous 15 minutes. With this update, the availability of the service and operation names can be configured by using the following field: `spec.template.queryFrontend.jaegerQuery.servicesQueryDuration`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3139[TRACING-3139])
* Before this update, the `query-frontend` pod might get stopped when out-of-memory (OOM) as a result of searching a large trace. With this update, resource limits can be set to prevent this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-4009[TRACING-4009])

[id="distributed-tracing-rn_3-2_jaeger-release-notes_deprecated-functionality"]
=== Deprecated functionality

* In the {DTProductName} 3.2, Jaeger and support for Elasticsearch remain deprecated, and both are planned to be removed in a future release.
Red Hat will provide support for these components and fixes for CVEs and bugs with critical and higher severity during the current release lifecycle, but these components will no longer receive feature enhancements.
The {TempoOperator} and the {OTELName} are the preferred Operators for distributed tracing collection and storage.
Users must adopt the OpenTelemetry and Tempo distributed tracing stack because it is the stack to be enhanced going forward.

* In the {DTProductName} 3.2, the Jaeger agent is deprecated and planned to be removed in the following release.
Red Hat will provide bug fixes and support for the Jaeger agent during the current release lifecycle, but the Jaeger agent will no longer receive enhancements and will be removed.
The OpenTelemetry Collector provided by the {OTELName} is the preferred Operator for injecting the trace collector agent.
