==== Known issues

//There is currently a known issue:
There are currently known issues:

* Currently, when used with the {TempoOperator}, the Jaeger UI only displays services that have sent traces in the last 15 minutes. For services that did not send traces in the last 15 minutes, traces are still stored but not displayed in the Jaeger UI. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3139[TRACING-3139])
* Currently, the {TempoShortName} fails on the IBM Z (`s390x`) architecture. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3545[TRACING-3545])

==== Deprecated functionality

In the {DTProductName} 3.1.1, Jaeger and support for Elasticsearch remain deprecated, and both are planned to be removed in a future release. Red Hat will provide critical and above CVE bug fixes and support for these components during the current release lifecycle, but these components will no longer receive feature enhancements.

In the {DTProductName} 3.1.1, Tempo provided by the {TempoOperator} and the OpenTelemetry Collector provided by the {OTELName} are the preferred Operators for distributed tracing collection and storage. The OpenTelemetry and Tempo distributed tracing stack is to be adopted by all users because this will be the stack that will be enhanced going forward.

[id="distributed-tracing-rn_3-1_tempo-release-notes_bug-fixes"]
==== Bug fixes

This update introduces the following bug fixes for the {TempoShortName}:

* Before this update, when a TempoStack instance was created with the `monitorTab` enabled in {product-title} 4.15, the required `tempo-redmetrics-cluster-monitoring-view` ClusterRoleBinding was not created. This update resolves the issue by fixing the Operator RBAC for the monitor tab when the Operator is deployed in an arbitrary namespace. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3786[TRACING-3786])
* Before this update, when a TempoStack instance was created on an {product-title} cluster with only an IPv6 networking stack, the compactor and ingestor pods ran in the `CrashLoopBackOff` state, resulting in multiple errors. This update provides support for IPv6 clusters.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3226[TRACING-3226])

This update introduces the following bug fix for the {JaegerShortName}:

* Before this update, the connection target URL for the `jaeger-agent` container in the `jager-query` pod was overwritten with another namespace URL in {product-title} 4.13. This was caused by a bug in the sidecar injection code in the `jaeger-operator`, causing nondeterministic `jaeger-agent` injection. With this update, the Operator prioritizes the Jaeger instance from the same namespace as the target deployment. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3722[TRACING-3722])

[id="distributed-tracing-rn_3-0_jaeger-release-notes_bug-fixes"]
==== Bug fixes

This update introduces the following bug fix for the {JaegerShortName}:

* Before this update, the {JaegerName} Operator used other images than `relatedImages`. This caused the *ImagePullBackOff* error in disconnected network environments when launching the `jaeger` pod because the `oc adm catalog mirror` command mirrors images specified in `relatedImages`.

This update introduces the following bug fixes for the {TempoShortName}:

* Before this update, the `TempoStack` CRD was not accepting custom CA certificate despite the option to choose CA certificates. This update fixes support for the custom TLS CA option for connecting to object storage. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3462[TRACING-3462])
* Before this update, when mirroring the {DTProductName} Operator images to a mirror registry for use in a disconnected cluster, the related Operator images for `tempo`, `tempo-gateway`, `opa-openshift`, and `tempo-query` were not mirrored. This update fixes support for disconnected environments when using the `oc adm catalog mirror` CLI command. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3523[TRACING-3523])
* Before this update, the query frontend service of the {DTProductName} was using internal mTLS when gateway was not deployed. This caused endpoint failure errors. This update fixes mTLS when Gateway is not deployed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3510[TRACING-3510])

==== Bug fixes

* Before this update, connection was refused due to a missing gRPC port on the `jaeger-query` deployment. This issue resulted in `transport: Error while dialing: dial tcp :16685: connect: connection refused` error message. With this update, the Jaeger Query gRPC port (16685) is successfully exposed on the Jaeger Query service. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3322[TRACING-3322])

* Before this update, the wrong port was exposed for `jaeger-production-query`, resulting in refused connection. With this update, the issue is fixed by exposing the Jaeger Query gRPC port (16685) on the Jaeger Query deployment. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-2968[TRACING-2968])

* Before this update, when deploying {SMProductShortName} on {sno} clusters in disconnected environments, the Jaeger pod frequently went into the `Pending` state. With this update, the issue is fixed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3312[TRACING-3312])

* Before this update, the Jaeger Operator pod restarted with the default memory value due to the `reason: OOMKilled` error message. With this update, this issue is fixed by removing the resource limits. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3173[TRACING-3173])

* Add Ingress and Route configuration for the Gateway.

* Support the `managed` and `unmanaged` states in the `TempoStack` custom resource.

* Expose the following additional ingestion protocols in the Distributor service: Jaeger Thrift binary, Jaeger Thrift compact, Jaeger gRPC, and Zipkin. When the Gateway is enabled, only the OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) gRPC is enabled.

* Expose the Jaeger Query gRPC endpoint on the Query Frontend service.

* Support multitenancy without Gateway authentication and authorization.

* Currently, the custom TLS CA option is not implemented for connecting to object storage. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3462[TRACING-3462])

* Currently, when used with the {TempoOperator}, the Jaeger UI only displays services that have sent traces in the last 15 minutes. For services that did not send traces in the last 15 minutes, traces are still stored but not displayed in the Jaeger UI. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3139[TRACING-3139])

* Currently, the {TempoShortName} fails on the {ibm-z-title} (`s390x`) architecture. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3545[TRACING-3545])

* Currently, the Tempo query frontend service must not use internal mTLS when Gateway is not deployed. This issue does not affect the Jaeger Query API. The workaround is to disable mTLS. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3510[TRACING-3510])
+
.Workaround
+
Disable mTLS as follows:
+
. Open the {TempoOperator} ConfigMap for editing by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit configmap tempo-operator-manager-config -n openshift-tempo-operator <1>
----
<1> The project where the {TempoOperator} is installed.

. Disable the mTLS in the Operator configuration by updating the YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
data:
  controller_manager_config.yaml: |
    featureGates:
      httpEncryption: false
      grpcEncryption: false
      builtInCertManagement:
        enabled: false
----

. Restart the {TempoOperator} pod by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rollout restart deployment.apps/tempo-operator-controller -n openshift-tempo-operator
----


* Missing images for running the {TempoOperator} in restricted environments. The {TempoName} CSV is missing references to the operand images. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3523[TRACING-3523])
+
.Workaround
+
Add the {TempoOperator} related images in the mirroring tool to mirror the images to the registry:
+
[source,yaml]

=== Technology Preview features

This release introduces support for the {TempoName} as a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview] feature for {DTProductName}.

:FeatureName: The {TempoName}
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

The feature uses version 0.1.0 of the {TempoName} and version 2.0.1 of the upstream {TempoShortName} components.

You can use the {TempoShortName} to replace Jaeger so that you can use S3-compatible storage instead of ElasticSearch.
Most users who use the {TempoShortName} instead of Jaeger will not notice any difference in functionality because the {TempoShortName} supports the same ingestion and query protocols as Jaeger and uses the same user interface.

If you enable this Technology Preview feature, note the following limitations of the current implementation:

* The {TempoShortName} currently does not support disconnected installations. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3145[TRACING-3145])

* When you use the Jaeger user interface (UI) with the {TempoShortName}, the Jaeger UI lists only services that have sent traces within the last 15 minutes. For services that have not sent traces within the last 15 minutes, those traces are still stored even though they are not visible in the Jaeger UI. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3139[TRACING-3139])

Expanded support for the {TempoOperator} is planned for future releases of the {DTProductName}.
Possible additional features might include support for TLS authentication, multitenancy, and multiple clusters.
For more information about the {TempoOperator}, see the link:https://tempo-operator.netlify.app[Tempo community documentation].

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
When upgrading to the {DTProductName} 2.4, the Operator recreates the Elasticsearch instance, which might take five to ten minutes. Distributed tracing will be down and unavailable for that period.

This release introduces the following new features and enhancements:

* Rebrands Red Hat OpenShift Jaeger as the {DTProductName}.

* Updates {JaegerName} Operator to Jaeger 1.28. Going forward, the {DTProductName} will only support the `stable` Operator channel.
Channels for individual releases are no longer supported.

* Adds support for OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) to the Query service.

* Introduces a new distributed tracing icon that appears in the OperatorHub.

* Includes rolling updates to the documentation to support the name change and new features.

[id="distr-tracing-rn_2-0_technology-preview-features"]
=== Technology Preview features

This release adds the {OTELName} as a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview], which you install using the {OTELName} Operator. {OTELName} is based on the link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] APIs and instrumentation. The {OTELName} includes the OpenTelemetry Operator and Collector. You can use the Collector to receive traces in the OpenTelemetry or Jaeger protocol and send the trace data to the {DTProductName}. Other capabilities of the Collector are not supported at this time. The OpenTelemetry Collector allows developers to instrument their code with vendor agnostic APIs, avoiding vendor lock-in and enabling a growing ecosystem of observability tooling.
