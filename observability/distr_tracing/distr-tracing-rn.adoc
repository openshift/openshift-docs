=== {TempoName}

The {TempoName} 3.5 is provided through the link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/rhosdt/tempo-operator-bundle/642c3e0eacf1b5bdbba7654a/history[{TempoOperator} 0.15.3].

[id="distr-tracing_3-5_tempo-release-notes_new-features-and-enhancements_{context}"]
==== New features and enhancements

This update introduces the following enhancements:

* With this update, you can configure the Tempo backend services to report the internal tracing data by using the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP).
* With this update, the `traces.span.metrics` namespace becomes the default metrics namespace on which the Jaeger query retrieves the Prometheus metrics. The purpose of this change is to provide compatibility with the OpenTelemetry Collector version 0.109.0 and later where this namespace is the default. Customers who are still using an earlier OpenTelemetry Collector version can configure this namespace by adding the following field and value: `spec.template.queryFrontend.jaegerQuery.monitorTab.redMetricsNamespace: ""`.

[id="distr-tracing_3-5_tempo-release-notes_bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== Bug fixes

This update introduces the following bug fix:

////
* Before this update, the `oauth-proxy` container did not have any compute resources assigned to it. With this update, the container correctly sets the resources as specified in the `TempoStack` custom resource.
////

* Before this update, the {TempoOperator} failed when the `TempoStack` custom resource had the `spec.storage.tls.enabled` field set to `true` and used an Amazon S3 object store with the Security Token Service (STS) authentication. With this update, such a `TempoStack` custom resource configuration does not cause the {TempoOperator} to fail.

[id="distr-tracing_3-5_jaeger-release-notes_{context}"]
=== {JaegerName}

The {JaegerName} 3.5 is the last release of the {JaegerName} that Red Hat plans to support.

====

[id="distr-tracing_3-4_tempo-release-notes_new-features-and-enhancements_{context}"]
==== New features and enhancements

This update introduces the following enhancements:

* The monitor tab in the Jaeger UI for TempoStack instances uses a new default metrics namespace: `traces.span.metrics`. Before this update, the Jaeger UI used an empty namespace. The new `traces.span.metrics` namespace default is also used by the OpenTelemetry Collector 0.113.0. You can set the empty value for the metrics namespace by using the following field in the `TempoStack` custom resouce: `spec.template.queryFrontend.monitorTab.redMetricsNamespace: ""`.
+
[WARNING]
====
This is a breaking change. If you are using both the {TempoName} and {OTELName}, you must upgrade to the {OTELName} 3.4 before upgrading to the {TempoName} 3.4.
====

* New and optional `spec.timeout` field in the `TempoStack` and `TempoMonolithic` custom resource definitions for configuring one timeout value for all components. The timeout value is set to 30 seconds, `30s`, by default.
+
[WARNING]
====
This is a breaking change.
====

[id="distr-tracing_3-4_tempo-release-notes_bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== Bug fixes

This update introduces the following bug fixes:

* Before this update, the {TempoShortName} failed on the {ibm-z-title} (`s390x`) architecture. With this update, the {TempoShortName} is available for the {ibm-z-title} (`s390x`) architecture. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3545[TRACING-3545])
* Before this update, the {TempoShortName} failed on clusters with non-private networks. With this update, you can deploy the {TempoShortName} on clusters with non-private networks. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-4507[TRACING-4507])
* Before this update, the Jaeger UI might fail due to reaching a trace quantity limit, resulting in the *504 Gateway Timeout* error in the `tempo-query` logs. After this update, the issue is resolved by introducing two optional fields in the `tempostack` or `tempomonolithic` custom resource:
+
** New `spec.timeout` field for configuring the timeout.
** New `spec.template.queryFrontend.jaegerQuery.findTracesConcurrentRequests` field for improving the query performance of the Jaeger UI.
+
[TIP]
====
One querier can handle up to 20 concurrent queries by default. Increasing the number of concurrent queries further is achieved by scaling up the querier instances.

* Currently, the Tempo query frontend service must not use internal mTLS when Gateway is not deployed. This issue does not affect the Jaeger Query API. The workaround is to disable mTLS. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3510[TRACING-3510])
+
.Workaround
+
Disable mTLS as follows:
+
. Open the {TempoOperator} ConfigMap for editing by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit configmap tempo-operator-manager-config -n openshift-tempo-operator <1>
----
<1> The project where the {TempoOperator} is installed.

. Disable the mTLS in the Operator configuration by updating the YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
data:
  controller_manager_config.yaml: |
    featureGates:
      httpEncryption: false
      grpcEncryption: false
      builtInCertManagement:

----

. Restart the {TempoOperator} pod by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rollout restart deployment.apps/tempo-operator-controller -n openshift-tempo-operator
----


* Missing images for running the {TempoOperator} in restricted environments. The {TempoName} CSV is missing references to the operand images. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3523[TRACING-3523])
+
.Workaround
+
Add the {TempoOperator} related images in the mirroring tool to mirror the images to the registry:

==== Bug fixes

* Before this update, connection was refused due to a missing gRPC port on the `jaeger-query` deployment. This issue resulted in `transport: Error while dialing: dial tcp :16685: connect: connection refused` error message. With this update, the Jaeger Query gRPC port (16685) is successfully exposed on the Jaeger Query service. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3322[TRACING-3322])

* Before this update, the wrong port was exposed for `jaeger-production-query`, resulting in refused connection. With this update, the issue is fixed by exposing the Jaeger Query gRPC port (16685) on the Jaeger Query deployment. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-2968[TRACING-2968])

* Before this update, when deploying {SMProductShortName} on {sno} clusters in disconnected environments, the Jaeger pod frequently went into the `Pending` state. With this update, the issue is fixed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3312[TRACING-3312])

* Before this update, the Jaeger Operator pod restarted with the default memory value due to the `reason: OOMKilled` error message. With this update, this issue is fixed by removing the resource limits. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3173[TRACING-3173])

=== Technology Preview features

This release introduces support for the {TempoName} as a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview] feature for {DTProductName}.

:FeatureName: The {TempoName}
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

The feature uses version 0.1.0 of the {TempoName} and version 2.0.1 of the upstream {TempoShortName} components.

You can use the {TempoShortName} to replace Jaeger so that you can use S3-compatible storage instead of ElasticSearch.
Most users who use the {TempoShortName} instead of Jaeger will not notice any difference in functionality because the {TempoShortName} supports the same ingestion and query protocols as Jaeger and uses the same user interface.

If you enable this Technology Preview feature, note the following limitations of the current implementation:

* The {TempoShortName} currently does not support disconnected installations. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3145[TRACING-3145])

* When you use the Jaeger user interface (UI) with the {TempoShortName}, the Jaeger UI lists only services that have sent traces within the last 15 minutes. For services that have not sent traces within the last 15 minutes, those traces are still stored even though they are not visible in the Jaeger UI. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3139[TRACING-3139])

Expanded support for the {TempoOperator} is planned for future releases of the {DTProductName}.
Possible additional features might include support for TLS authentication, multitenancy, and multiple clusters.
For more information about the {TempoOperator}, see the link:https://tempo-operator.netlify.app[Tempo community documentation].

* Updates {JaegerName} Operator to Jaeger 1.28. Going forward, the {DTProductName} will only support the `stable` Operator channel.
Channels for individual releases are no longer supported.

* Adds support for OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) to the Query service.

* Introduces a new distributed tracing icon that appears in the OperatorHub.

* Includes rolling updates to the documentation to support the name change and new features.

[id="distr-tracing_2-0_technology-preview-features_{context}"]
=== Technology Preview features

This release adds the {OTELName} as a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview], which you install using the {OTELName} Operator. {OTELName} is based on the link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] APIs and instrumentation. The {OTELName} includes the OpenTelemetry Operator and Collector. You can use the Collector to receive traces in the OpenTelemetry or Jaeger protocol and send the trace data to the {DTProductName}. Other capabilities of the Collector are not supported at this time. The OpenTelemetry Collector allows developers to instrument their code with vendor agnostic APIs, avoiding vendor lock-in and enabling a growing ecosystem of observability tooling.
