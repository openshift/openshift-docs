[id="distr-tracing_3-1_jaeger-release-notes_support-for-elasticsearch-operator_{context}"]
==== Support for {es-op}

{JaegerName} 3.1 is supported for use with the {es-op} 5.6, 5.7, and 5.8.

[id="distr-tracing_3-1_jaeger-release-notes_deprecated-functionality_{context}"]
==== Deprecated functionality

In the {DTProductName} 3.1, Jaeger and support for Elasticsearch remain deprecated, and both are planned to be removed in a future release. Red Hat will provide critical and above CVE bug fixes and support for these components during the current release lifecycle, but these components will no longer receive feature enhancements.

In the {DTProductName} 3.1, Tempo provided by the {TempoOperator} and the OpenTelemetry Collector provided by the {OTELName} are the preferred Operators for distributed tracing collection and storage. The OpenTelemetry and Tempo distributed tracing stack is to be adopted by all users because this will be the stack that will be enhanced going forward.

[id="distr-tracing_3-1_jaeger-release-notes_new-features-and-enhancements_{context}"]
==== New features and enhancements

This update introduces the following enhancements for the {JaegerShortName}:

* {JaegerName} 3.1 is based on the open source link:https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger] release 1.53.0.

[id="distr-tracing_3-1_jaeger-release-notes_bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== Bug fixes

This update introduces the following bug fix for the {JaegerShortName}:

* Before this update, the connection target URL for the `jaeger-agent` container in the `jager-query` pod was overwritten with another namespace URL in {product-title} 4.13. This was caused by a bug in the sidecar injection code in the `jaeger-operator`, causing nondeterministic `jaeger-agent` injection. With this update, the Operator prioritizes the Jaeger instance from the same namespace as the target deployment. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3722[TRACING-3722])

[id="distr-tracing_3-0_jaeger-release-notes_bug-fixes_{context}"]
==== Bug fixes

This update introduces the following bug fix for the {JaegerShortName}:

* Before this update, the {JaegerName} Operator used other images than `relatedImages`. This caused the *ImagePullBackOff* error in disconnected network environments when launching the `jaeger` pod because the `oc adm catalog mirror` command mirrors images specified in `relatedImages`. This update provides support for disconnected environments when using the `oc adm catalog mirror` CLI command. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3546[TRACING-3546])

* Before this update, when mirroring the {DTProductName} Operator images to a mirror registry for use in a disconnected cluster, the related Operator images for `tempo`, `tempo-gateway`, `opa-openshift`, and `tempo-query` were not mirrored. This update fixes support for disconnected environments when using the `oc adm catalog mirror` CLI command. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3523[TRACING-3523])
* Before this update, the query frontend service of the {DTProductName} was using internal mTLS when gateway was not deployed. This caused endpoint failure errors. This update fixes mTLS when Gateway is not deployed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3510[TRACING-3510])

* Before this update, connection was refused due to a missing gRPC port on the `jaeger-query` deployment. This issue resulted in `transport: Error while dialing: dial tcp :16685: connect: connection refused` error message. With this update, the Jaeger Query gRPC port (16685) is successfully exposed on the Jaeger Query service. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3322[TRACING-3322])

* Before this update, the wrong port was exposed for `jaeger-production-query`, resulting in refused connection. With this update, the issue is fixed by exposing the Jaeger Query gRPC port (16685) on the Jaeger Query deployment. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-2968[TRACING-2968])

* Before this update, when deploying {SMProductShortName} on {sno} clusters in disconnected environments, the Jaeger pod frequently went into the `Pending` state. With this update, the issue is fixed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3312[TRACING-3312])

* Before this update, the Jaeger Operator pod restarted with the default memory value due to the `reason: OOMKilled` error message. With this update, this issue is fixed by removing the resource limits. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3173[TRACING-3173])

* Add Ingress and Route configuration for the Gateway.

* Support the `managed` and `unmanaged` states in the `TempoStack` custom resource.

* Expose the following additional ingestion protocols in the Distributor service: Jaeger Thrift binary, Jaeger Thrift compact, Jaeger gRPC, and Zipkin. When the Gateway is enabled, only the OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) gRPC is enabled.

* Expose the Jaeger Query gRPC endpoint on the Query Frontend service.

* Support multitenancy without Gateway authentication and authorization.

=== Technology Preview features

This release introduces support for the {TempoName} as a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview] feature for {DTProductName}.

:FeatureName: The {TempoName}
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

The feature uses version 0.1.0 of the {TempoName} and version 2.0.1 of the upstream {TempoShortName} components.

You can use the {TempoShortName} to replace Jaeger so that you can use S3-compatible storage instead of ElasticSearch.
Most users who use the {TempoShortName} instead of Jaeger will not notice any difference in functionality because the {TempoShortName} supports the same ingestion and query protocols as Jaeger and uses the same user interface.

If you enable this Technology Preview feature, note the following limitations of the current implementation:

* The {TempoShortName} currently does not support disconnected installations. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3145[TRACING-3145])

* When you use the Jaeger user interface (UI) with the {TempoShortName}, the Jaeger UI lists only services that have sent traces within the last 15 minutes. For services that have not sent traces within the last 15 minutes, those traces are still stored even though they are not visible in the Jaeger UI. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3139[TRACING-3139])

Expanded support for the {TempoOperator} is planned for future releases of the {DTProductName}.
Possible additional features might include support for TLS authentication, multitenancy, and multiple clusters.
For more information about the {TempoOperator}, see the link:https://tempo-operator.netlify.app[Tempo community documentation].

This release adds support for auto-provisioning certificates using the {es-op}.

Self-provisioning by using the {JaegerName} Operator to call the {es-op} during installation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When upgrading to the {DTProductName} 2.4, the Operator recreates the Elasticsearch instance, which might take five to ten minutes. Distributed tracing will be down and unavailable for that period.

=== Technology Preview features

Creating the Elasticsearch instance and certificates first and then configuring the {JaegerShortName} to use the certificate is a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview] for this release.

This release introduces the following new features and enhancements:

* Rebrands Red Hat OpenShift Jaeger as the {DTProductName}.

* Updates {JaegerName} Operator to Jaeger 1.28. Going forward, the {DTProductName} will only support the `stable` Operator channel.
Channels for individual releases are no longer supported.

* Adds support for OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) to the Query service.

* Introduces a new distributed tracing icon that appears in the OperatorHub.

* Includes rolling updates to the documentation to support the name change and new features.

=== Technology Preview features

This release adds the {OTELName} as a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview], which you install using the {OTELName} Operator. {OTELName} is based on the link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] APIs and instrumentation. The {OTELName} includes the OpenTelemetry Operator and Collector. You can use the Collector to receive traces in the OpenTelemetry or Jaeger protocol and send the trace data to the {DTProductName}. Other capabilities of the Collector are not supported at this time. The OpenTelemetry Collector allows developers to instrument their code with vendor agnostic APIs, avoiding vendor lock-in and enabling a growing ecosystem of observability tooling.
