:FeatureName: The {JaegerName}
include::modules/deprecated-feature.adoc[]

The {JaegerName} Operator uses a custom resource definition (CRD) file that defines the architecture and configuration settings to be used when creating and deploying the {JaegerShortName} resources. You can install the default configuration or modify the file.

If you have installed {DTShortName} as part of {SMProductName}, you can perform basic configuration as part of the xref:../../../service_mesh/v2x/installing-ossm.adoc#installing-ossm[ServiceMeshControlPlane], but for complete control, you must configure a Jaeger CR and then xref:../../../service_mesh/v2x/ossm-observability.adoc#ossm-config-external-jaeger_observability[reference your distributed tracing configuration file in the ServiceMeshControlPlane].

The {JaegerName} has predefined deployment strategies. You specify a deployment strategy in the custom resource file. When you create a {JaegerShortName} instance, the Operator uses this configuration file to create the objects necessary for the deployment.

[id="supported-deployment-strategies"]
== Supported deployment strategies

The {JaegerName} Operator currently supports the following deployment strategies:

`allInOne`:: - This strategy is intended for development, testing, and demo purposes; it is not intended for production use. The main backend components, Agent, Collector, and Query service, are all packaged into a single executable which is configured, by default. to use in-memory storage.
+
[NOTE]
====
In-memory storage is not persistent, which means that if the {JaegerShortName} instance shuts down, restarts, or is replaced, that your trace data will be lost. And in-memory storage cannot be scaled, since each pod has its own memory. For persistent storage, you must use the `production` or `streaming` strategies, which use Elasticsearch as the default storage.
====

`production`:: The production strategy is intended for production environments, where long term storage of trace data is important, as well as a more scalable and highly available architecture is required. Each of the backend components is therefore deployed separately. The Agent can be injected as a sidecar on the instrumented application. The Query and Collector services are configured with a supported storage type - currently Elasticsearch. Multiple instances of each of these components can be provisioned as required for performance and resilience purposes.

`streaming`:: The streaming strategy is designed to augment the production strategy by providing a streaming capability that effectively sits between the Collector and the Elasticsearch backend storage. This provides the benefit of reducing the pressure on the backend storage, under high load situations, and enables other trace post-processing capabilities to tap into the real time span data directly from the streaming platform (https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.6/html/using_amq_streams_on_openshift/index[AMQ Streams]/ https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/[Kafka]).
+
[NOTE]
====

* The streaming strategy requires an additional Red Hat subscription for AMQ Streams.

* The streaming deployment strategy is currently unsupported on {ibm-z-name}.

[id="injecting-sidecars"]
== Injecting sidecars

The {JaegerName} relies on a proxy sidecar within the application's pod to provide the Agent. The {JaegerName} Operator can inject Agent sidecars into deployment workloads. You can enable automatic sidecar injection or manage it manually.
