== Grafana DataSource Integration

When the gateway is enabled, it leverages OpenShift's authentication and authorization mechanisms, allowing users to query different tenants. This prevents direct configuration of the datasource to communicate with Tempo, necessitating a method to authenticate against the gateway. Currently there are only one available option to achieve this.


=== Using Static Service Token

If direct integration between Grafana and OpenShift authentication prove unfeasible due to architectural constraints, such as the use of an external Grafana instance or other operational limitations, an alternative authentication mechanism exists.

This method involves leveraging a ServiceAccount token, configured with an extended lifespan, to facilitate authentication with the gateway. While effective, it introduces a key consideration: all users authenticated through this mechanism within Grafana will inherently share the same access privileges. This shared access model consequently limits the granularity of access control, preventing the implementation of highly detailed, user-specific permissions. Therefore, organizations requiring robust, fine-grained access management may find this approach less suitable.
