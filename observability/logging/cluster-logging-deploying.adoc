{Product-title} Operators use custom resources (CR) to manage applications and their components. High-level configuration and settings are provided by the user within a CR. The Operator translates high-level directives into low-level actions, based on best practices embedded within the Operator’s logic. A custom resource definition (CRD) defines a CR and lists all the configurations available to users of the Operator. Installing an Operator creates the CRDs, which are then used to generate CRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must install the {clo} *after* the log store Operator.
====

You deploy {logging} by installing the {loki-op} or {es-op} to manage your log store, followed by the {clo} to manage the components of logging. You can use either the {product-title} web console or the {product-title} CLI to install or configure {logging}.

You can alternatively apply all example objects.
