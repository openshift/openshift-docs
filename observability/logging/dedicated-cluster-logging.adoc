As a cluster administrator, you can deploy the {logging} to aggregate logs for a range of services.

{product-title} clusters can perform logging tasks using the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator.

The {logging} is configurable using a `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR)
deployed in the `openshift-logging` project namespace.

The Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator watches for changes to `ClusterLogging` CR, creates
any missing logging components, and adjusts the logging environment accordingly.

The `ClusterLogging` CR is based on the `ClusterLogging` custom resource
definition (CRD), which defines a complete OpenShift Logging environment and
includes all the components of the logging stack to collect, store, and visualize
logs.

The `retentionPolicy` parameter in the `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR) defines how long the internal Elasticsearch log store retains logs.
