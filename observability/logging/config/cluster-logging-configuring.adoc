{logging-title-uc} is configurable using a `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR) deployed
in the `openshift-logging` project.

The {clo} watches for changes to `ClusterLogging` CR,
creates any missing logging components, and adjusts the logging environment accordingly.

The `ClusterLogging` CR is based on the `ClusterLogging` custom resource definition (CRD), which defines a complete {logging} environment and includes all the components of the logging stack to collect, store and visualize logs.

You can configure the following for {logging}:

* You can overwrite the image for each {logging} component by modifying the appropriate
environment variable in the `cluster-logging-operator` Deployment.

* You can specify specific nodes for the logging components using node selectors.

////
* You can specify the Log collectors to deploy to each node in a cluster, either Fluentd or Rsyslog.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Rsyslog log collector is currently a Technology Preview feature.

// The following include statements pull in the module files that comprise

[IMPORTANT]
====
The logging routes are managed by the {clo} and cannot be modified by the user.
