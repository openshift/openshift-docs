toc::[]

As a cluster administrator, you can deploy {logging} on an {product-title} cluster, and use it to collect and aggregate node system audit logs, application container logs, and infrastructure logs. You can forward logs to your chosen log outputs, including on-cluster, Red{nbsp}Hat managed log storage. You can also visualize your log data in the {product-title} web console, or the Kibana web console, depending on your deployed log storage solution.

include::snippets/logging-kibana-dep-snip.adoc[]

{product-title} cluster administrators can deploy {logging} by using Operators. For information, see xref:../../observability/logging/cluster-logging-deploying.adoc#cluster-logging-deploying[Installing {logging}].

The Operators are responsible for deploying, upgrading, and maintaining {logging}. After the Operators are installed, you can create a `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR) to schedule {logging} pods and other resources necessary to support {logging}. You can also create a `ClusterLogForwarder` CR to specify which logs are collected, how they are transformed, and where they are forwarded to.
