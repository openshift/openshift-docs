= About Logging
:context: cluster-logging

toc::[]

As a cluster administrator, you can deploy {logging} on an {product-title} cluster, and use it to collect and aggregate node system audit logs, application container logs, and infrastructure logs.

You can use {logging} to perform the following tasks:

* Forward logs to your chosen log outputs, including on-cluster, Red{nbsp}Hat managed log storage.
* Visualize your log data in the {product-title} web console.

[NOTE]
====
Because {logging} releases on a different cadence from {product-title}, the {logging} documentation is available as a separate documentation set at link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_logging/[Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift {logging-uc}].
