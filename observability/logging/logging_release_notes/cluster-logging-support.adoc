{logging-uc} {for} is an opinionated collector and normalizer of application, infrastructure, and audit logs. You can use it to forward logs to various supported systems.

{logging-uc} is not:

* A high scale log collection system
* Security Information and Event Monitoring (SIEM) compliant
* A "bring your own" (BYO) log collector configuration
* Historical or long term log retention or storage
* A guaranteed log sink
* Secure storage - audit logs are not stored by default

== Collecting logging data for Red Hat Support

When opening a support case, it is helpful to provide debugging information about your cluster to Red{nbsp}Hat Support.

You can use the xref:../../../support/gathering-cluster-data.adoc#gathering-cluster-data[must-gather tool] to collect diagnostic information for project-level resources, cluster-level resources, and each of the {logging} components.
For prompt support, supply diagnostic information for both {product-title} and {logging}.
