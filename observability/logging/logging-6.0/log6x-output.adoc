`loki`:: Loki, a horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant log aggregation system.
`kafka`:: A Kafka broker. The `kafka` output can use a TCP or TLS connection.
`elasticsearch`:: An external Elasticsearch instance. The `elasticsearch` output can use a TLS connection.
`fluentdForward`:: An external log aggregation solution that supports Fluentd. This option uses the Fluentd `forward` protocols. The `fluentForward` output can use a TCP or TLS connection and supports shared-key authentication by providing a `shared_key` field in a secret. Shared-key authentication can be used with or without TLS.

The `fluentdForward` output is only supported if you are using the Fluentd collector. It is not supported if you are using the Vector collector. If you are using the Vector collector, you can forward logs to Fluentd by using the `http` output.
