[id="log6x-release-notes-6-0-0-removal-notice"]
== Removal notice

* With this release, {logging} no longer supports the `ClusterLogging.logging.openshift.io` and `ClusterLogForwarder.logging.openshift.io` custom resources. Refer to the product documentation for details on the replacement features. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-5803[LOG-5803])

* With this release, {logging} no longer manages or deploys log storage (such as Elasticsearch), visualization (such as Kibana), or Fluentd-based log collectors. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-5368[LOG-5368])

[NOTE]
====
In order to continue to use Elasticsearch and Kibana managed by the elasticsearch-operator, the administrator must modify those object's ownerRefs before deleting the ClusterLogging resource.

== New features and enhancements

* This feature introduces a new architecture for {logging} {for} by shifting component responsibilities to their relevant Operators, such as for storage, visualization, and collection. It introduces the `ClusterLogForwarder.observability.openshift.io` API for log collection and forwarding. Support for the `ClusterLogging.logging.openshift.io` and `ClusterLogForwarder.logging.openshift.io` APIs, along with the Red Hat managed Elastic stack (Elasticsearch and Kibana), is removed. Users are encouraged to migrate to the Red Hat `LokiStack` for log storage. Existing managed Elasticsearch deployments can be used for a limited time. Automated migration for log collection is not provided, so administrators need to create a new ClusterLogForwarder.observability.openshift.io specification to replace their previous custom resources. Refer to the official product documentation for more details. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3493[LOG-3493])

* With this release, the responsibility for deploying the {logging} view plugin shifts from the {clo} to the {coo-first}. For new log storage installations that need visualization, the {coo-full} and the associated UIPlugin resource must be deployed. Refer to the xref:../../../observability/cluster_observability_operator/cluster-observability-operator-overview.adoc#cluster-observability-operator-overview[Cluster Observability Operator Overview] product documentation for more details. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-5461[LOG-5461])

* This enhancement sets default requests and limits for Vector collector deployments' memory and CPU usage based on Vector documentation recommendations. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4745[LOG-4745])

* This enhancement updates Vector to align with the upstream version v0.37.1. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-5296[LOG-5296])

* This enhancement introduces an alert that triggers when log collectors buffer logs to a node's file system and use over 15% of the available space, indicating potential back pressure issues. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-5381[LOG-5381])

* This enhancement updates the selectors for all components to use common Kubernetes labels. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-5906[LOG-5906])

* This enhancement changes the collector configuration to deploy as a ConfigMap instead of a secret, allowing users to view and edit the configuration when the ClusterLogForwarder is set to Unmanaged. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-5599[LOG-5599])

* This enhancement adds the ability to configure the Vector collector log level using an annotation on the ClusterLogForwarder, with options including trace, debug, info, warn, error, or off. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-5372[LOG-5372])

* This enhancement adds validation to reject configurations where Amazon CloudWatch outputs use multiple AWS roles, preventing incorrect log routing. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-5640[LOG-5640])
* This enhancement removes the Log Bytes Collected and Log Bytes Sent graphs from the metrics dashboard. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-5964[LOG-5964])

* This enhancement updates the must-gather functionality to only capture information for inspecting Logging 6.0 components, including Vector deployments from ClusterLogForwarder.observability.openshift.io resources and the Red Hat managed LokiStack. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-5949[LOG-5949])


* This enhancement improves Azure storage secret validation by providing early warnings for specific error conditions. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4571[LOG-4571])

[id="log6x-release-notes-6-0-0-technology-preview-features"]
== Technology Preview features

* This release introduces a Technology Preview feature for log forwarding using OpenTelemetry. A new output type,` OTLP`, allows sending JSON-encoded log records using the OpenTelemetry data model and resource semantic conventions. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4225[LOG-4225])

[id="log6x-release-notes-6-0-0-bug-fixes"]
== Bug fixes

* Before this update, the `CollectorHighErrorRate` and `CollectorVeryHighErrorRate` alerts were still present. With this update, both alerts are removed in the {logging} 6.0 release but might return in a future release. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3432[LOG-3432])
