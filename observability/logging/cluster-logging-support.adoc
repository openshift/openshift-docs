== Collecting logging data for Red Hat Support

When opening a support case, it is helpful to provide debugging information about your cluster to Red{nbsp}Hat Support.

You can use the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
xref:../../support/gathering-cluster-data.adoc#gathering-cluster-data[`must-gather` tool]
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/support/gathering-cluster-data.html#gathering-cluster-data[`must-gather` tool]
endif::[]
to collect diagnostic information for project-level resources, cluster-level resources, and each of the {logging} components.

For prompt support, supply diagnostic information for both {product-title} and {logging}.

[NOTE]
====
Do not use the `hack/logging-dump.sh` script. The script is no longer supported and does not collect data.
