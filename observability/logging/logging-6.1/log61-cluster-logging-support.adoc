{logging-uc} {for} is an opinionated collector and normalizer of application, infrastructure, and audit logs. It is intended to be used for forwarding logs to various supported systems.

{logging-uc} is not:

* A high scale log collection system
* Security Information and Event Monitoring (SIEM) compliant
* A "bring your own" (BYO) log collector configuration
* Historical or long term log retention or storage
* A guaranteed log sink
* Secure storage - audit logs are not stored by default

== Support exception for the Logging UI Plugin

Until the approaching General Availability (GA) release of the Cluster Observability Operator (COO), which is currently in link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview] (TP), Red{nbsp}Hat provides support to customers who are using Logging 6.0 or later with the COO for its Logging UI Plugin on {product-title} 4.14 or later. This support exception is temporary as the COO includes several independent features, some of which are still TP features, but the Logging UI Plugin is ready for GA.

== Collecting {logging} data for Red Hat Support

When opening a support case, it is helpful to provide debugging information about your cluster to Red{nbsp}Hat Support.

You can use the xref:../../../support/gathering-cluster-data.adoc#gathering-cluster-data[must-gather tool] to collect diagnostic information for project-level resources, cluster-level resources, and each of the {logging} components.
For prompt support, supply diagnostic information for both {product-title} and {logging}.
