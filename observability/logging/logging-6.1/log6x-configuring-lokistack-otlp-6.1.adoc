toc::[]

Logging 6.1 enables an API endpoint using the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). As OTLP is a standardized format not specifically designed for Loki, it requires additional configuration on Loki's side to map OpenTelemetry's data format to Loki's data model. OTLP lacks concepts such as _stream labels_ or _structured metadata_. Instead, OTLP provides metadata about log entries as *attributes*, grouped into three categories:

* Resource
* Scope
* Log

This allows metadata to be set for multiple entries simultaneously or individually as needed.

[id="attribute-mapping_{context}"]
== Attribute mapping

When the {loki-op} is set to `openshift-logging` mode, it automatically applies a default set of attribute mappings. These mappings align specific OTLP attributes with Loki's stream labels and structured metadata.

For typical setups, these default mappings should be sufficient. However, you might need to customize attribute mapping in the following cases:

* Using a custom Collector: If your setup includes a custom collector that generates additional attributes, consider customizing the mapping to ensure these attributes are retained in Loki.
* Adjusting attribute detail levels: If the default attribute set is more detailed than necessary, you can reduce it to essential attributes only. This can avoid excessive data storage and streamline the {logging} process.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Attributes that are not mapped to either stream labels or structured metadata are not stored in Loki.

[id="custom-attribute-mapping-for-openshift_{context}"]
=== Custom attribute mapping for OpenShift

When using the {loki-op} in `openshift-logging` mode, attribute mapping follow OpenShift defaults, but custom mappings can be configured to adjust these. Custom mappings allow further configurations to meet specific needs.

In `openshift-logging` mode, custom attribute mappings can be configured globally for all tenants or for individual tenants as needed. When custom mappings are defined, they are appended to the OpenShift defaults. If default recommended labels are not required, they can be disabled in the tenant configuration.

[NOTE]
====
A major difference between the {loki-op} and Loki itself lies in inheritance handling. Loki only copies `default_resource_attributes_as_index_labels` to tenants by default, while the {loki-op} applies the entire global configuration to each tenant in `openshift-logging` mode.
====

Within `LokiStack`, attribute mapping configuration is managed through the `limits` setting:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  limits:
    global:
      otlp: {} # <1>
    tenants:
      application:
        otlp: {} # <2>
----
<1> Global OTLP attribute configuration.
<2> OTLP attribute configuration for the `application` tenant within `openshift-logging` mode.

[NOTE]
====
Both global and per-tenant OTLP configurations can map attributes to stream labels or structured metadata. At least one stream label is required to save a log entry to Loki storage, so ensure this configuration meets that requirement.
====

Stream labels derive only from resource-level attributes, which the `LokiStack` resource structure reflects:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  limits:
    global:
      otlp:
        streamLabels:
          resourceAttributes:
          - name: "k8s.namespace.name"
          - name: "k8s.pod.name"
          - name: "k8s.container.name"
----

Structured metadata, in contrast, can be generated from resource, scope or log-level attributes:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  limits:
    global:
      otlp:
        streamLabels:
          # ...
        structuredMetadata:
          resourceAttributes:
          - name: "process.command_line"
          - name: "k8s\\.pod\\.labels\\..+"
            regex: true
          scopeAttributes:
          - name: "service.name"
          logAttributes:
          - name: "http.route"
----

[TIP]
====
Use regular expressions by setting `regex: true` for attributes names when mapping similar attributes in Loki.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Avoid using regular expressions for stream labels, as this can increase data volume.

[id="customizing-openshift-defaults_{context}"]
=== Customizing OpenShift defaults

In `openshift-logging` mode, certain attributes are required and cannot be removed from the configuration due to their role in OpenShift functions. Other attributes, labeled *recommended*, might be disabled if performance is impacted. 

When using the `openshift-logging` mode without custom attributes, you can achieve immediate compatibility with OpenShift tools. If additional attributes are needed as stream labels or structured metadata, use custom configuration. Custom configurations can merge with default configurations.

[id="removing-recommended-attributes_{context}"]
=== Removing recommended attributes

To reduce default attributes in `openshift-logging` mode, disable recommended attributes:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  tenants:
    mode: openshift-logging
    openshift:
      otlp:
        disableRecommendedAttributes: true # <1>
----
<1> Set `disableRecommendedAttributes: true` to remove recommended attributes, which limits default attributes to the *required attributes*.

[NOTE]
====
This option is beneficial if the default attributes causes performance or storage issues. This setting might negatively impact query performance, as it removes default stream labels. You should pair this option with a custom attribute configuration to retain attributes essential for queries.
