toc::[]

You can use an API endpoint by using the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) with Logging 6.1. As OTLP is a standardized format not specifically designed for Loki, OTLP requires an additional Loki configuration to map data format of OpenTelemetry to data model of Loki. OTLP lacks concepts such as _stream labels_ or _structured metadata_. Instead, OTLP provides metadata about log entries as *attributes*, grouped into the following three categories:

* Resource
* Scope
* Log

You can set metadata for multiple entries simultaneously or individually as needed.

[id="attribute-mapping_{context}"]
== Attribute mapping

When you set the {loki-op} to the `openshift-logging` mode, {loki-op} automatically applies a default set of attribute mappings. These mappings align specific OTLP attributes with stream labels and structured metadata of Loki.

For typical setups, these default mappings are sufficient. However, you might need to customize attribute mapping in the following cases:

* Using a custom collector: If your setup includes a custom collector that generates additional attributes, consider customizing the mapping to ensure these attributes are retained in Loki.
* Adjusting attribute detail levels: If the default attribute set is more detailed than necessary, you can reduce it to essential attributes only. This can avoid excessive data storage and streamline the {logging} process.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Attributes that are not mapped to either stream labels or structured metadata are not stored in Loki.

[id="custom-attribute-mapping-for-openshift_{context}"]
=== Custom attribute mapping for OpenShift
When using the {loki-op} in `openshift-logging` mode, attribute mapping follow OpenShift default values, but you can configure custom mappings to adjust default values. 
In the `openshift-logging` mode, you can configure custom attribute mappings globally for all tenants or for individual tenants as needed. When you define custom mappings, they are appended to the OpenShift default values. If you do not need default labels, you can disable them in the tenant configuration.

[NOTE]
====
A major difference between the {loki-op} and Loki lies in inheritance handling. Loki copies only `default_resource_attributes_as_index_labels` to tenants by default, while the {loki-op} applies the entire global configuration to each tenant in the `openshift-logging` mode.
====

Within `LokiStack`, attribute mapping configuration is managed through the `limits` setting. See the following example `LokiStack` configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  limits:
    global:
      otlp: {} # <1>
    tenants:
      application:
        otlp: {} # <2>
----
<1> Defines global OTLP attribute configuration.
<2> OTLP attribute configuration for the `application` tenant within `openshift-logging` mode.

[NOTE]
====
Both global and per-tenant OTLP configurations can map attributes to stream labels or structured metadata. At least one stream label is required to save a log entry to Loki storage, so ensure this configuration meets that requirement.
====

Stream labels derive only from resource-level attributes, which the `LokiStack` resource structure reflects:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  limits:
    global:
      otlp:
        streamLabels:
          resourceAttributes:
          - name: "k8s.namespace.name"
          - name: "k8s.pod.name"
          - name: "k8s.container.name"
----

Structured metadata, in contrast, can be generated from resource, scope or log-level attributes:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  limits:
    global:
      otlp:
        streamLabels:
# ...
        structuredMetadata:
          resourceAttributes:
          - name: "process.command_line"
          - name: "k8s\\.pod\\.labels\\..+"
            regex: true
          scopeAttributes:
          - name: "service.name"
          logAttributes:
          - name: "http.route"
----

[TIP]
====
Use regular expressions by setting `regex: true` for attributes names when mapping similar attributes in Loki.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Avoid using regular expressions for stream labels, as this can increase data volume.

[id="customizing-openshift-defaults_{context}"]
=== Customizing OpenShift defaults

In `openshift-logging` mode, certain attributes are required and cannot be removed from the configuration due to their role in OpenShift functions. Other attributes, labeled *recommended*, might be disabled if performance is impacted. 

When using the `openshift-logging` mode without custom attributes, you can achieve immediate compatibility with OpenShift tools. If additional attributes are needed as stream labels or structured metadata, use custom configuration. Custom configurations can merge with default configurations.

[id="removing-recommended-attributes_{context}"]
=== Removing recommended attributes

To reduce default attributes in `openshift-logging` mode, disable recommended attributes:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  tenants:
    mode: openshift-logging
    openshift:
      otlp:
        disableRecommendedAttributes: true # <1>
----
<1> Set `disableRecommendedAttributes: true` to remove recommended attributes, which limits default attributes to the *required attributes*.

[NOTE]
====
This option is beneficial if the default attributes causes performance or storage issues. This setting might negatively impact query performance, as it removes default stream labels. You should pair this option with a custom attribute configuration to retain attributes essential for queries.
