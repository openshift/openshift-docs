= Upgrading to Logging 6

:context: upgrading-to-logging-6

toc::[]

Logging v6 is a significant upgrade from previous releases. The notable changes are the following:

* Introduction of distinct operators to manage logging components. 
** {clo} manages log collection. 
** {loki-op} manages log storage.
** {coo-first} manages log visualization.
* Removal of support for managed log storage and visualization based on Elastic products such as Elasticsearch and Kibana.
* Deprecation of the Fluentd log collector implementation.
* Replacement of the following resources with the single `ClusterLogForwarder.observability.openshift.io` resource:
** `ClusterLogging.logging.openshift.io`
** `ClusterLogForwarder.logging.openshift.io` 

The {clo} does not provide an automated upgrade from Logging 5.x to Logging 6.x because of the different combinations in which Logging can be configured. You must install all the different operators for managing logging seperately. You can upgrade to Logging 6.x version from any Logging 5.x version. When upgrading to Logging 6.x, follow these steps:

. Go through the xref:summary-of-changes_upgrading-to-logging-6[Summary of changes]
