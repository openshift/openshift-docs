{product-title} Operators use custom resources (CRs) to manage applications and their components. You provide high-level configuration and settings through the CR. The Operator translates high-level directives into low-level actions, based on best practices embedded within the logic of the Operator. A custom resource definition (CRD) defines a CR and lists all the configurations available to users of the Operator. Installing an Operator creates the CRDs to generate CRs.


To get started with {logging}, you must install the following Operators:

* {loki-op} to manage your log store.
* {clo} to manage log collection and forwarding.
* {coo-first} to manage visualization.

You can use either the {product-title} web console or the {product-title} CLI to install or configure {logging}.


[IMPORTANT]
====
You must configure the {clo} after the {loki-op}.
