= Updating Logging

toc::[]

There are two types of {logging} updates: minor release updates (6.y.z) and major release updates (6.y).

== Minor release updates

If you installed the {logging} Operators using the *Automatic* update approval option, your Operators receive minor version updates automatically. You do not need to complete any manual update steps.

If you installed the {logging} Operators using the *Manual* update approval option, you must manually approve minor version updates. For more information, see xref:../../../operators/admin/olm-upgrading-operators.adoc#olm-approving-pending-upgrade_olm-upgrading-operators[Manually approving a pending Operator update].

== Updating Logging 5 to Logging 6

Logging v6 is a significant upgrade from previous releases. The notable changes are the following:

* Introduction of distinct operators to manage logging components. 
** {clo} manages log collection. 
** {loki-op} manages log storage.
** {coo-first} manages log visualization.
* Removal of support for managed log storage and visualization based on Elastic products such as Elasticsearch and Kibana.
* Deprecation of the Fluentd log collector implementation.
* Replacement of the following resources with the single `ClusterLogForwarder.observability.openshift.io` resource:
** `ClusterLogging.logging.openshift.io`
** `ClusterLogForwarder.logging.openshift.io` 

When upgrading to Logging 6.x, follow these steps:
