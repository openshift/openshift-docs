There are two types of {logging} updates: minor release updates (6.y.z) and major release updates (6.y).

[id="cluster-logging-upgrading-minor_{context}"]
== Minor release updates

If you installed the {logging} Operators using the *Automatic* update approval option, your Operators receive minor version updates automatically. You do not need to complete any manual update steps.

If you installed the {logging} Operators using the *Manual* update approval option, you must manually approve minor version updates. For more information, see xref:../../operators/admin/olm-upgrading-operators.adoc#olm-approving-pending-upgrade_olm-upgrading-operators[Manually approving a pending Operator update].

[id="cluster-logging-upgrading-major_{context}"]
== Major release updates

For major version updates you must complete some manual steps.

For major release version compatibility and support information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift_operators#platform-agnostic[OpenShift Operator Life Cycles].

[id="changes-in-logging-6_{context}"]
== Changes in OpenShift Logging 6

Logging v6 is a significant upgrade from previous releases. The notable changes are the following:

* Introduction of distinct operators to manage logging components. 
** {clo} manages log collection. 
** {loki-op} manages log storage.
** {coo-first} manages log visualization.
* Removal of support for managed log storage and visualization based on Elastic products such as Elasticsearch and Kibana.
* Deprecation of the Fluentd log collector implementation.
* Replacement of the following resources with the single `ClusterLogForwarder.observability.openshift.io` resource:
** `ClusterLogging.logging.openshift.io`
** `ClusterLogForwarder.logging.openshift.io` 

The {clo} does not provide an automated upgrade from Logging 5.x to Logging 6.x because of the different combinations in which Logging can be configured. You must install all the different operators for managing logging seperately. You can upgrade to Logging 6.x version from any Logging 5.x version.
