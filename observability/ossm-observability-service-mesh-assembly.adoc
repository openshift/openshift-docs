Red Hat OpenShift Observability provides real-time visibility, monitoring, and analysis of various system metrics, logs, and events to help you quickly diagnose and troubleshoot issues before they impact systems or applications.

Red Hat OpenShift Observability connects open-source observability tools and technologies to create a unified Observability solution. The components of Red Hat OpenShift Observability work together to help you collect, store, deliver, analyze, and visualize data.

{SMProductName} integrates with the following OpenShift Observability components:

* OpenShift Monitoring
* {DTProductName}

{SMProduct} also integrates with:

* Kiali provided by Red{nbsp}Hat, a powerful console for visualizing and managing your service mesh.
* {SMPlugin}, an {ocp-product-title} console plugin that seamlessly integrates Kiali console features into your {ocp-short-name} console.

//Observability attributes are not part of the Service Mesh standalone attributes file as of 10/22/2024
//There are Kiali attributes forthcoming.
//Kiali Operator provided by Red Hat is the official, approved name, and the name that appears in the console UI when presented with Kiali Operator options to install.
//There is a Jira created to add a number of attributes to the _attributes file for OSSM 3.0 GA.
//There are more things coming for Metrics, distributed tracing, and Kiali. The Service Mesh Console (OSSMC) plugin, for example, will be added to the Kiali distro. It is unclear what is necessary for GA and what is  being pushed post-GA, so the directories and respective assemblies have been left for traces, metrics, and kiali.

// TP 1 content. Banner handled separately by different PR handled by Tim O'Keefe. Per Tim, banner should appear across all 3.0 content, nothing needs to be added to this file
// Content may change, file names may change, directories may change, the order of directories may change, everything may change.
