Monitoring stack components are deployed by default in every {ocp-product-title} installation and are managed by the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO). These components include Prometheus, Alertmanager, Thanos Querier, and others. The CMO also deploys the Telemeter Client, which sends a subset of data from platform Prometheus instances to Red{nbsp}Hat to facilitate Remote Health Monitoring for clusters.

When you have added your application to the mesh, you can monitor the in-cluster health and performance of your applications running on {ocp-product-title} with metrics and customized alerts for CPU and memory usage, network connectivity, and other resource usage.

When you have added your application to the mesh in ambient mode, you can monitor the {istio} standard metrics of your application from the `ztunnel` resource and the waypoint proxies. The ztunnel also exposes a variety of DNS and debugging metrics.

Ambient mode uses two proxy layers, which results in two types of metrics for each application service. You can collect Layer 4 (L4) TCP metrics from both the ztunnel and the waypoint proxies. You can collect Layer 7 (L7) metrics, such as HTTP traffic metrics, from the waypoint proxies.
