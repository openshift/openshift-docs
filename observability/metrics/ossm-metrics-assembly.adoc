Monitoring stack components are deployed by default in every {ocp-product-title} installation and are managed by the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO). These components include Prometheus, Alertmanager, Thanos Querier, and others. The CMO also deploys the Telemeter Client, which sends a subset of data from platform Prometheus instances to Red{nbsp}Hat to facilitate Remote Health Monitoring for clusters.

// If there is an attribute for Cluster Monitoring Operator, it is not part of the common-attributes file for service-mesh-docs-main as of 08/27/2024. If it is added before Aug 30, 2024, this will be updated accordingly. Due to time constraints, it may be a post-TP1/in-time-for GA update.

When you have added your application to the mesh, you can monitor the in-cluster health and performance of your applications running on {ocp-product-title} with metrics and customized alerts for CPU and memory usage, network connectivity, and other resource usage.
