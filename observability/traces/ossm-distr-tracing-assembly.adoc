{OTELName}:: Is based on the open source link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry project], which aims to provide unified, standardized, and vendor-neutral telemetry data collection for cloud-native software. {OTELName} product provides support for deploying and managing the OpenTelemetry Collector and simplifying the workload instrumentation.
+
The link:https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/[OpenTelemetry Collector] can receive, process, and forward telemetry data in multiple formats, making it the ideal component for telemetry processing and interoperability between telemetry systems. The Collector provides a unified solution for collecting and processing metrics, traces, and logs.
