{product-title} Observability provides real-time visibility, monitoring, and analysis of various system metrics, logs, traces, and events to help users quickly diagnose and troubleshoot issues before they impact systems or applications. 

To help ensure the reliability, performance, and security of your applications and infrastructure, {product-title} offers the following Observability components:

* Monitoring
* Power Monitoring
* Logging 
* Distributed tracing
* Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry
* Network Observability

The components of OpenShift Observability [deliver] the five pillars of Observability:

. Data collection
+
Collect metrics with Prometheus, logs with Vector, and traces with OpenTelemetry. 

. Data storage
+
Store metrics with Prometheus or Thanos, logs with Loki, and traces with Jaeger or Elasticsearch.

. Data delivery 
+
Aggregate and normalize data and then transport it with Observability Operator.

. Data visualization
+
Visualize data with an out of the box user interface and full support in OpenShift Web Console.

. Data analytics
+
Query metrics, search metrics targets, and filter logs by severity. 

== Monitoring
Monitor the health and performance of your applications running on OpenShift with metrics that include data such as CPU and memory usage, network traffic, and request latencies. Deploy and manage in-cluster monitoring stack components with the Cluster Monitoring Operator.

For more information, see xref:../observability/monitoring/monitoring-overview.adoc#monitoring-overview[Monitoring overview].

== Logging 
Collect, visualizeanalyze, forward, and store log data to troubleshoot issues, identify performance bottlenecks, and detect security threats. In logging 5.7 and later versions, users can configure the LokiStack deployment to produce customized alerts and recorded metrics.

For more information, see xref:../observability/logging/cluster-logging.adoc#cluster-logging[About Logging].

== Distributed tracing
Use traces to understand how requests or transactions are processed by your applications and optimize performance.

For more information, see xref:../observability/distr_tracing/distr_tracing_arch/distr-tracing-architecture.adoc#distributed-tracing-architecture[Distributed tracing architecture].


== {OTELName}
Use the Red Hat build of the open source OpenTelemetry project to collect unified, standardized, and vendor-neutral telemetry data collection for cloud-native software. 

For more information, see xref:../observability/otel/otel-release-notes.adoc#otel-release-notes[{OTELName} release notes]. 

== Network Observability
Observe the network traffic for OpenShift Container Platform clusters and create network flows with the Network Observability Operator. View and analyze the stored network flows information in the OpenShift Container Platform console for further insight and troubleshooting.

For more information, see xref:../observability/network_observability/network-observability-overview.adoc#network-observability-overview[Network Observability overview]. 

== Power Monitoring 
Monitor the power usage of workloads and identify the most power-consuming namespaces running in an OpenShift cluster with key power consumption metrics, such as CPU or DRAM measured at process or container level. Visualize energy-related system statistics with the power monitoring Operator.
