== Bug fixes

This update introduces the following bug fix:

* Before this update, the checkbox to enable Operator monitoring was not available in the web console when installing the {OTELOperator}. As a result, a *ServiceMonitor* resource was not created in the `openshift-opentelemetry-operator` namespace.
