If you are already using the {JaegerName} for your applications, you can migrate to the {OTELName}, which is based on the link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] open-source project.

The {OTELShortName} provides a set of APIs, libraries, agents, and instrumentation to facilitate observability in distributed systems. The OpenTelemetry Collector in the {OTELShortName} can ingest the Jaeger protocol, so you do not need to change the SDKs in your applications.

Migration from the {JaegerShortName} to the {OTELShortName} requires configuring the OpenTelemetry Collector and your applications to report traces seamlessly. You can migrate sidecar and sidecarless deployments.
