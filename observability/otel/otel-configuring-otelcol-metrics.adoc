= Configuring the OpenTelemetry Collector metrics
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: otel-configuring-metrics

The following list shows some of these metrics:

	* Collector memory usage
	* CPU utilization
	* Number of active traces and spans processed
	* Dropped spans, logs, or metrics
	* Exporter and receiver statistics

The {OTELOperator} automatically creates a service named `<instance_name>-collector-monitoring` that exposes the Collector's internal metrics. This service listens on port `8888` by default.

You can use these metrics for monitoring the Collector's performance, resource consumption, and other internal behaviors. You can also use a Prometheus instance or another monitoring tool to scrape these metrics from the mentioned `<instance_name>-collector-monitoring` service.

[NOTE]
====
When the `spec.observability.metrics.enableMetrics` field in the `OpenTelemetryCollector` custom resource (CR) is set to `true`, the `OpenTelemetryCollector` CR automatically creates a Prometheus `ServiceMonitor` or `PodMonitor` CR to enable Prometheus to scrape your metrics.

.Prerequisites

* Monitoring for user-defined projects is enabled in the cluster.

.Procedure

* To enable metrics of an OpenTelemetry Collector instance, set the `spec.observability.metrics.enableMetrics` field to `true`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpenTelemetryCollector
metadata:
  name: <name>
spec:
  observability:
    metrics:
      enableMetrics: true
----

.Verification

You can use the *Administrator* view of the web console to verify successful configuration:

. Go to *Observe* -> *Targets*.
. Filter by *Source: User*.
. Check that the *ServiceMonitors* or *PodMonitors* in the `opentelemetry-collector-<instance_name>` format have the *Up* status.
