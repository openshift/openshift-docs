[id="otel_3-3_bug-fixes_{context}"]
=== Bug fixes

This update introduces the following bug fixes:

* Before this update, the `ServiceMonitor` object was failing to scrape operator metrics due to missing permissions for accessing the metrics endpoint. With this update, this issue is fixed by creating the `ServiceMonitor` custom resource when operator monitoring is enabled. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-4288[TRACING-4288])
* Before this update, the Collector service and the headless service were both monitoring the same endpoints, which caused duplication of metrics collection and `ServiceMonitor` objects. With this update, this issue is fixed by not creating the headless service. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OBSDA-773[OBSDA-773])

//There are currently known issues:

* Currently, the cluster monitoring of the {OTELOperator} is disabled due to a bug (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3761[TRACING-3761]). The bug is preventing the cluster monitoring from scraping metrics from the {OTELOperator} due to a missing label `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true` that is required for the cluster monitoring and service monitor object.
+
.Workaround
+
You can enable the cluster monitoring as follows:
+
. Add the following label in the Operator namespace: `oc label namespace openshift-opentelemetry-operator openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true`
+
. Create a service monitor, role, and role binding:

{OTELName} 2.0 is based on the open source link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] release 0.33.0.

This release adds the {OTELName} as a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview], which you install using the {OTELName} Operator. {OTELName} is based on the link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] APIs and instrumentation. The {OTELName} includes the OpenTelemetry Operator and Collector. You can use the Collector to receive traces in the OpenTelemetry or Jaeger protocol and send the trace data to the {OTELName}. Other capabilities of the Collector are not supported at this time. The OpenTelemetry Collector allows developers to instrument their code with vendor agnostic APIs, avoiding vendor lock-in and enabling a growing ecosystem of observability tooling.
