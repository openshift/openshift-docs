Receivers get data into the Collector. A receiver can be push or pull based. Generally, a receiver accepts data in a specified format, translates it into the internal format, and passes it to processors and exporters defined in the applicable pipelines. By default, no receivers are configured. One or more receivers must be configured. Receivers support one or more data sources.

Currently, the following General Availability and Technology Preview receivers are available for the {OTELShortName}:
