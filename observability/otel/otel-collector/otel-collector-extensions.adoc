*PipelineZ*:: Shows detailed information about the active pipelines in the Collector. This page displays the pipeline type, whether data are modified, and the associated receivers, processors, and exporters for each pipeline. An example of this page's URL is `http://localhost:55679/debug/pipelinez`.
*ExtensionZ*:: Shows the currently active extensions in the Collector. An example of this page's URL is `http://localhost:55679/debug/extensionz`.
*FeatureZ*:: Shows the feature gates enabled in the Collector along with their status and description. An example of this page's URL is `http://localhost:55679/debug/featurez`.
*TraceZ*:: Shows spans categorized by latency. Available time ranges include 0 µs, 10 µs, 100 µs, 1 ms, 10 ms, 100 ms, 1 s, 10 s, 1 m. This page also allows for quick inspection of error samples. An example of this page's URL is `http://localhost:55679/debug/tracez`.
