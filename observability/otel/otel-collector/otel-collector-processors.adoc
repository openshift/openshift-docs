Processors process the data between it is received and exported. Processors are optional. By default, no processors are enabled. Processors must be enabled for every data source. Not all processors support all data sources. Depending on the data source, multiple processors might be enabled. Note that the order of processors matters.

[id="batch-processor_{context}"]
== Batch Processor

The Batch Processor batches traces and metrics to reduce the number of outgoing connections needed to transfer the telemetry information.

[id="memorylimiter-processor_{context}"]
== Memory Limiter Processor

The Memory Limiter Processor periodically checks the Collector's memory usage and pauses data processing when the soft memory limit is reached. This processor supports traces, metrics, and logs. The preceding component, which is typically a receiver, is expected to retry sending the same data and may apply a backpressure to the incoming data. When memory usage exceeds the hard limit, the Memory Limiter Processor forces garbage collection to run.

[id="attributes-processor_{context}"]
== Attributes Processor

The Attributes Processor can modify attributes of a span, log, or metric. You can configure this processor to filter and match input data and include or exclude such data for specific actions.

:FeatureName: The Attributes Processor
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

This processor operates on a list of actions, executing them in the order specified in the configuration. The following actions are supported:

Insert:: Inserts a new attribute into the input data when the specified key does not already exist.

Update:: Updates an attribute in the input data if the key already exists.

Upsert:: Combines the insert and update actions: Inserts a new attribute if the key does not exist yet. Updates the attribute if the key already exists.

Delete:: Removes an attribute from the input data.

Hash:: Hashes an existing attribute value as SHA1.

Extract:: Extracts values by using a regular expression rule from the input key to the target keys defined in the rule. If a target key already exists, it is overridden similarly to the Span Processor's `to_attributes` setting with the existing attribute as the source.

Convert:: Converts an existing attribute to a specified type.

<2> Defines a value provided in the `metrics` field as a `strict` exact match or `regexp` regular expression.
<3> Lists the metric names, which are exact matches or matches for regular expressions, of the metrics to be converted to delta metrics. If a metric matches both the `include` and `exclude` filters, the `exclude` filter takes precedence.
<4> Optional: Configures which metrics to exclude. When omitted, no metrics are excluded from conversion to delta metrics.

[id="groupbyattrsprocessor-processor_{context}"]
== Group-by-Attributes Processor

The Group-by-Attributes Processor groups all spans, log records, and metric datapoints that share the same attributes by reassigning them to a Resource that matches those attributes.

:FeatureName: The Group-by-Attributes Processor
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

At minimum, configuring this processor involves specifying an array of attribute keys to be used to group spans, log records, or metric datapoints together, as in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
processors:
  groupbyattrs:
    keys: # <1>
      - <key1> # <2>
      - <key2>
# ...
----
<1> Specifies attribute keys to group by.
<2> If a processed span, log record, or metric datapoint contains at least one of the specified attribute keys, it is reassigned to a Resource that shares the same attribute values; and if no such Resource exists, a new one is created. If none of the specified attribute keys is present in the processed span, log record, or metric datapoint, then it remains associated with its current Resource. Multiple instances of the same Resource are consolidated.

[id="transform-processor_{context}"]
== Transform Processor

The Transform Processor enables modification of telemetry data according to specified rules and in the link:https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/ottl[OpenTelemetry Transformation Language (OTTL)].
For each signal type, the processor processes a series of conditions and statements associated with a specific OTTL Context type and then executes them in sequence on incoming telemetry data as specified in the configuration.
Each condition and statement can access and modify telemetry data by using various functions, allowing conditions to dictate if a function is to be executed.

All statements are written in the OTTL.
You can configure multiple context statements for different signals, traces, metrics, and logs.
The value of the `context` type specifies which OTTL Context the processor must use when interpreting the associated statements.
