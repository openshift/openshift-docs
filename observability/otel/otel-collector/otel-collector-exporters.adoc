Exporters send data to one or more back ends or destinations. An exporter can be push or pull based. By default, no exporters are configured. One or more exporters must be configured. Exporters can support one or more data sources. Exporters might be used with their default settings, but many exporters require configuration to specify at least the destination and security settings.

[id="otlp-exporter_{context}"]
== OTLP Exporter

The OTLP gRPC Exporter exports traces and metrics by using the OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP).

<1> The OTLP gRPC endpoint. If the `+https://+` scheme is used, then client transport security is enabled and overrides the `insecure` setting in the `tls`.
<2> The client-side TLS configuration. Defines paths to TLS certificates.
<3> Disables client transport security when set to `true`. The default value is `false` by default.
<4> Skips verifying the certificate when set to `true`. The default value is `false`.
<5> Specifies the time interval at which the certificate is reloaded. If the value is not set, the certificate is never reloaded. The `reload_interval` accepts a string containing valid units of time such as `ns`, `us` (or `Âµs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`.
<6> Overrides the virtual host name of authority such as the authority header field in requests. You can use this for testing.
<7> Headers are sent for every request performed during an established connection.

<1> The OTLP HTTP endpoint. If the `+https://+` scheme is used, then client transport security is enabled and overrides the `insecure` setting in the `tls`.
<2> The client side TLS configuration. Defines paths to TLS certificates.
<3> Headers are sent in every HTTP request.
<4> If true, disables HTTP keep-alives. It will only use the connection to the server for a single HTTP request.

# ...
----
<1> The `routing_key: service` exports spans for the same service name to the same Collector instance to provide accurate aggregation. The `routing_key: traceID` exports spans based on their `traceID`. The implicit default is `traceID` based routing.
<2> The OTLP is the only supported load-balancing protocol. All options of the OTLP exporter are supported.
<3> You can configure only one resolver.
<4> The static resolver distributes the load across the listed endpoints.
<5> You can use the DNS resolver only with a Kubernetes headless service.
<6> The Kubernetes resolver is recommended.

[id="prometheus-exporter_{context}"]

<2> The network endpoint where the metrics are exposed.
<3> The server-side TLS configuration. Defines paths to TLS certificates.
<4> If set, exports metrics under the provided value. No default.
<5> Key-value pair labels that are applied for every exported metric. No default.
<6> If `true`, metrics are exported using the OpenMetrics format. Exemplars are only exported in the OpenMetrics format and only for histogram and monotonic sum metrics such as `counter`. Disabled by default.
<7> If `enabled` is `true`, all the resource attributes are converted to metric labels by default. Disabled by default.
<8> Defines how long metrics are exposed without updates. The default is `5m`.
<9> Adds the metrics types and units suffixes. Must be disabled if the monitor tab in Jaeger console is enabled. The default is `true`.

[id="prometheus-remote-write-exporter_{context}"]
== Prometheus Remote Write Exporter

The Prometheus Remote Write Exporter exports metrics to compatible back ends.

        metrics:
          exporters: [prometheusremotewrite]
# ...
----
<1> Endpoint for sending the metrics.
<2> Server-side TLS configuration. Defines paths to TLS certificates.
<3> When set to `true`, creates a `target_info` metric for each resource metric.
<4> When set to `true`, exports a `_created` metric for the Summary, Histogram, and Monotonic Sum metric points.
<5> Maximum size of the batch of samples that is sent to the remote write endpoint. Exceeding this value results in batch splitting. The default value is `3000000`, which is approximately 2.861 megabytes.

[WARNING]
====
* This exporter drops non-cumulative monotonic, histogram, and summary OTLP metrics.

* You must enable the `--web.enable-remote-write-receiver` feature flag on the remote Prometheus instance. Without it, pushing the metrics to the instance using this exporter fails.

[id="kafka-exporter_{context}"]
== Kafka Exporter

The Kafka Exporter exports logs, metrics, and traces to Kafka. This exporter uses a synchronous producer that blocks and does not batch messages. You must use it with batch and queued retry processors for higher throughput and resiliency.
