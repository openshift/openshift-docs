Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Observability provides real-time visibility, monitoring, and analysis of various system metrics, logs, and events to help you quickly diagnose and troubleshoot issues before they impact systems or applications.

Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Observability connects open-source observability tools and technologies to create a unified Observability solution. The components of Red Hat OpenShift Observability work together to help you collect, store, deliver, analyze, and visualize data.

{SMProductName} integrates with the following Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Observability components:

* OpenShift Monitoring
* {DTProductName}

{SMProduct} also integrates with:

* Kiali provided by Red{nbsp}Hat, a powerful console for visualizing and managing your service mesh.
* {SMPlugin}, an {ocp-product-title} console plugin that seamlessly integrates Kiali console features into your {ocp-short-name} console.

The following components in {SMProduct} ambient mode generate a detailed telemetry for all service communications within a mesh:

* Ztunnel generates Layer 4 (L4) telemetry such as TCP metrics.
* Waypoint proxies generates Layer 7 (L7) telemetry for HTTP, HTTP/2, gRPC traffic metrics, and distributed traces.
