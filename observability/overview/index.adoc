{ObservabilityLongName} connects open-source observability tools and technologies to create a unified {ObservabilityShortName} solution. The components of {ObservabilityLongName} work together to help you collect, store, deliver, analyze, and visualize data.

[NOTE]
====
With the exception of monitoring, {ObservabilityLongName} components have distinct release cycles separate from the core {product-title} release cycles. See the Red{nbsp}Hat link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift_operators[OpenShift Operator Life Cycles] page for their release compatibility.

[id="monitoring-overview-index_{context}"]
== Monitoring
Monitor the in-cluster health and performance of your applications running on {product-title} with metrics and customized alerts for CPU and memory usage, network connectivity, and other resource usage. Monitoring stack components are deployed and managed by the {cmo-full}.

Monitoring stack components are deployed by default in every {product-title} installation and are managed by the {cmo-first}. These components include Prometheus, Alertmanager, Thanos Querier, and others. The {cmo-short} also deploys the Telemeter Client, which sends a subset of data from platform Prometheus instances to Red Hat to facilitate Remote Health Monitoring for clusters.

For more information, see xref:../../observability/monitoring/monitoring-overview.adoc#monitoring-overview[Monitoring overview] and xref:../../support/remote_health_monitoring/about-remote-health-monitoring.adoc#about-remote-health-monitoring[About remote health monitoring].

[id="cluster-logging-index_{context}"]
== Logging
Collect, visualize, forward, and store log data to troubleshoot issues, identify performance bottlenecks, and detect security threats. In logging 5.7 and later versions, users can configure the LokiStack deployment to produce customized alerts and recorded metrics.

For more information, see xref:../../observability/logging/cluster-logging.adoc#cluster-logging[About Logging].

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
[id="distr-tracing-architecture-index_{context}"]
== Distributed tracing
Store and visualize large volumes of requests passing through distributed systems, across the whole stack of microservices, and under heavy loads. Use it for monitoring distributed transactions, gathering insights into your instrumented services, network profiling, performance and latency optimization, root cause analysis, and troubleshooting the interaction between components in modern cloud-native microservices-based applications.

For more information, see xref:../../observability/distr_tracing/distr-tracing-architecture.adoc#distributed-tracing-architecture[Distributed tracing architecture].

[id="otel-release-notes-index_{context}"]
== {OTELName}
Instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry traces, metrics, and logs to analyze and understand your software's performance and behavior. Use open-source back ends like Tempo or Prometheus, or use commercial offerings. Learn a single set of APIs and conventions, and own the data that you generate.

For more information, see xref:../../observability/otel/otel-installing.adoc#install-otel[{OTELName}].

[id="network-observability-overview-index_{context}"]
== Network Observability
Observe the network traffic for {product-title} clusters and create network flows with the Network Observability Operator. View and analyze the stored network flows information in the {product-title} console for further insight and troubleshooting.

For more information, see xref:../../observability/network_observability/network-observability-overview.adoc#network-observability-overview[Network Observability overview].
