:FeatureName: The {coo-full} monitoring UI plugin
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

The monitoring UI plugin adds monitoring features to the Administrator perspective of the OpenShift web console.

* **{rh-rhacm}:** The monitoring plugin in {coo-first} allows it to function in {rh-rhacm-first} environments, providing {rh-rhacm} with the same alerting capabilities as {product-title}. You can configure the plugin to fetch alerts from the {rh-rhacm} Alertmanager backend. This enables seamless integration and user experience by aligning {rh-rhacm} and {product-title} monitoring workflows.
