[IMPORTANT]
====
Until the approaching General Availability (GA) release of the Cluster Observability Operator (COO), which is currently in link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview] (TP), Red{nbsp}Hat provides support to customers who are using Logging 6.0 or later with the COO for the logging UI plugin on {product-title} 4.14 or later. This support exception is temporary as the COO includes several independent features, some of which are still TP features, but the logging UI plugin is ready for GA.
====

The logging UI plugin surfaces logging data in the {product-title} web console on the *Observe* -> *Logs* page. 
You can specify filters, queries, time ranges and refresh rates, with the results displayed as a list of collapsed logs, which can then be expanded to show more detailed information for each log.

When you have also deployed the Troubleshooting UI plugin on {product-title} version 4.16+, it connects to the Korrel8r service and adds direct links from the Administration perspective, from the **Observe** -> **Logs** page, to the **Observe** -> **Metrics** page with a correlated PromQL query. It also adds a **See Related Logs** link from the Administration perspective alerting detail page, at **Observe** -> **Alerting**,  to the **Observe** -> **Logs** page with a correlated filter set selected.

The features of the plugin are categorized as:

dev-console::	Adds the logging view to the Developer perspective.
alerts::	Merges the web console alerts with log-based alerts defined in the Loki ruler. Adds a log-based metrics chart in the alert detail view.
dev-alerts::	Merges the web console alerts with log-based alerts defined in the Loki ruler. Adds a log-based metrics chart in the alert detail view for the Developer perspective.


For {coo-first} versions, the support for these features in {product-title} versions is shown in the following table:
