:FeatureName: The Cluster Observability Operator
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

The dashboard UI plugin supports enhanced dashboards in the OpenShift web console at *Observe* -> *Dashboards* . You can add other Prometheus datasources from the cluster to the default dashboards, in addition to the in-cluster datasource. This results in a unified observability experience across different data sources.

The plugin searches for datasources from `ConfigMap` resources in the `openshift-config-managed` namespace, that have the label `console.openshift.io/dashboard-datasource: 'true'`.
