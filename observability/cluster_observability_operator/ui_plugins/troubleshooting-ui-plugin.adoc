:FeatureName: The Cluster Observability Operator
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

The troubleshooting UI plugin for {product-title} version 4.16+ provides observability signal correlation, powered by the open source Korrel8r project.
With the troubleshooting panel that is available under *Observe* -> *Alerting*, you can easily correlate metrics, logs, alerts, netflows, and additional observability signals and resources, across different data stores. 
Users of {product-title} version 4.17+ can also access the troubleshooting UI panel from the Application Launcher {launch}.

When you install the troubleshooting UI plugin, a link:https://github.com/korrel8r/korrel8r[Korrel8r] service named `korrel8r` is deployed in the same namespace, and it is able to locate related observability signals and Kubernetes resources from its correlation engine.

The output of Korrel8r is displayed in the form of an interactive node graph in the {product-title} web console. 
Nodes in the graph represent a type of resource or signal, while edges represent relationships.
When you click on a node, you are automatically redirected to the corresponding web console page with the specific information for that node, for example, metric, log, pod.
