The {coo-first} is an optional component of the {product-title} designed for creating and managing highly customizable monitoring stacks. It enables cluster administrators to automate configuration and management of monitoring needs extensively, offering a more tailored and detailed view of each namespace compared to the default {product-title} monitoring system.

The standalone {coo-short} documentation is available at link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_cluster_observability_operator/1-latest/html/about_red_hat_openshift_cluster_observability_operator/index[].
