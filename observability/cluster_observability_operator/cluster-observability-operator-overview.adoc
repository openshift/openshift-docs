The {coo-first} is an optional component of the {product-title} designed for creating and managing highly customizable monitoring stacks. It enables cluster administrators to automate configuration and management of monitoring needs extensively, offering a more tailored and detailed view of each namespace compared to the default {product-title} monitoring system.

The {coo-short} deploys the following monitoring components:

* **Prometheus** - A highly available Prometheus instance capable of sending metrics to an external endpoint by using remote write.
* **Thanos Querier** (optional) - Enables querying of Prometheus instances from a central location.
* **Alertmanager** (optional) - Provides alert configuration capabilities for different services.
* **UI plugins** (optional) - Enhances the observability capabilities with plugins for monitoring, logging, distributed tracing and troubleshooting.
* **Korrel8r** (optional) - Provides observability signal correlation, powered by the open source Korrel8r project.
