toc::[]

The {coo-first} is an optional {product-title} Operator that enables administrators to create standalone monitoring stacks that are independently configurable for use by different services and users.

The {coo-short} complements the built-in monitoring capabilities of {product-title}. You can deploy it in parallel with the default platform and user workload monitoring stacks managed by the {cmo-first}.

These release notes track the development of the {coo-full} in {product-title}.

The following table provides information about which features are available depending on the version of {coo-full} and {product-title}:

[id="cluster-observability-operator-1-0-new-features-enhancements_{context}"]
=== New features and enhancements

* {coo-short} is now enabled for {product-title} platform monitoring. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-476[*COO-476*])
** Implements HTTPS support for {coo-short} web server. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-480[*COO-480*])
** Implements authn/authz for {coo-short} web server. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-481[*COO-481*])
** Configures ServiceMonitor resource to collect metrics from {coo-short}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-482[*COO-482*])
** Adds `operatorframework.io/cluster-monitoring=true` annotation to the OLM bundle. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-483[*COO-483*])
** Defines the alerting strategy for {coo-short} . (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-484[*COO-484*])
** Configures PrometheusRule for alerting. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-485[*COO-485*])

* Support level annotations have been added to the `UIPlugin` CR when created. The support level is based on the plugin type, with values of `DevPreview`, `TechPreview`, or `GeneralAvailability`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-318[*COO-318*])

// must-gather postponed to 1.1
//* You can now gather debugging information about {coo-short} by using the `oc adm must-gather` CLI command. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-194[*COO-194*])

* You can now configure the Alertmanager `scheme` and `tlsConfig` fields in the Prometheus CR. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-219[*COO-219*])

// Dev preview so cannot document
//* You can now install the Monitoring UI plugin using {coo-short}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-262[*COO-262*])

* The extended Technical Preview for the troubleshooting panel adds support for correlating traces with Kubernetes resources and directly with other observable signals including logs, alerts, metrics, and network events. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-450[*COO-450*])
** You can select a Tempo instance and tenant when you navigate to the tracing page by clicking *Observe -> Tracing* in the web console. The preview troubleshooting panel only works with the `openshift-tracing / platform` instance and the `platform` tenant.
** The troubleshooting panel works best in the *Administrator* perspective. It has limited functionality in the Developer perspective due to authorization issues with some back ends, most notably Prometheus for metrics and alerts. This will be addressed in a future release.

=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the default namespace for the {coo-short}  installation was `openshift-operators`. With this release, the defaullt namespace changes to `openshift-cluster-observability-operator`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-32[*COO-32*])

* Previously, when viewing a Tempo instance from the Distributed Tracing UI plugin, the scatter plot graph showing the traces duration was not rendered correctly. The bubble size was too large and overlapped the x and y axis. With this release, the graph is rendered correctly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-319[*COO-319*])

[id="cluster-observability-operator-0-1-2-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, certain cluster service version (CSV) annotations were not included in the metadata for {coo-short}.
Because of these missing annotations, certain {coo-short} features and capabilities did not appear in the package manifest or in the OperatorHub user interface.
This release adds the missing annotations, thereby resolving this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-11[*COO-11*])

* Previously, automatic updates of the {coo-short} did not work, and a newer version of the Operator did not automatically replace the older version, even though the newer version was available in OperatorHub.
This release resolves the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-12[*COO-12*])

* Previously, Thanos Querier only listened for network traffic on port 9090 of 127.0.0.1 (`localhost`), which resulted in a `502 Bad Gateway` error if you tried to reach the Thanos Querier service.
With this release, the Thanos Querier configuration has been updated so that the component now listens on the default port (10902), thereby resolving the issue.
As a result of this change, you can also now modify the port via server side apply (SSA) and add a proxy chain, if required. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-14[*COO-14*])
