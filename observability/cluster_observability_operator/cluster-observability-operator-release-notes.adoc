:FeatureName: The Cluster Observability Operator
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

The {coo-first} is an optional {product-title} Operator that enables administrators to create standalone monitoring stacks that are independently configurable for use by different services and users.

The {coo-short} complements the built-in monitoring capabilities of {product-title}. You can deploy it in parallel with the default platform and user workload monitoring stacks managed by the {cmo-first}.

These release notes track the development of the {coo-full} in {product-title}.

The following table provides information about which features are available depending on the version of {coo-full} and {product-title}:

[id="cluster-observability-operator-0-4-0-bug-fixes_{context}"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, metrics were not available to normal users when accessed in the Developer perspective of the web console, by clicking on **Observe** -> **Logs**.
This release resolves the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-288[*COO-288*])

This release resolves the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-299[*COO-299*])

This release resolves the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-298[*COO-298*])

* Previously, there was an authorization vulnerability in the Distributed tracing UI plugin.
This release resolves the issue and the Distributed tracing UI plugin has been hardened by using only multi-tenant `TempoStack` and `TempoMonolithic` instances going forward.

[id="cluster-observability-operator-release-notes-0-1-2"]
== {coo-full} 0.1.2
The following advisory is available for {coo-full} 0.1.2:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2024:1534[RHEA-2024:1534 {coo-full} 0.1.2]

=== CVEs

* link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-45142[CVE-2023-45142]

[id="cluster-observability-operator-0-1-2-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, certain cluster service version (CSV) annotations were not included in the metadata for {coo-short}.
Because of these missing annotations, certain {coo-short} features and capabilities did not appear in the package manifest or in the OperatorHub user interface.
This release adds the missing annotations, thereby resolving this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-11[*COO-11*])

* Previously, automatic updates of the {coo-short} did not work, and a newer version of the Operator did not automatically replace the older version, even though the newer version was available in OperatorHub.
This release resolves the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-12[*COO-12*])

* Previously, Thanos Querier only listened for network traffic on port 9090 of 127.0.0.1 (`localhost`), which resulted in a `502 Bad Gateway` error if you tried to reach the Thanos Querier service.
With this release, the Thanos Querier configuration has been updated so that the component now listens on the default port (10902), thereby resolving the issue.
As a result of this change, you can also now modify the port via server side apply (SSA) and add a proxy chain, if required. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-14[*COO-14*])

=== New features and enhancements
This release updates the {coo-full} to support installing the Operator in restricted networks or disconnected environments.

[id="cluster-observability-operator-release-notes-0-1"]
