Next steps after opening your PR:

* Ask for peer review from the OpenShift docs team:
  - For Red Hat associates: Ping @peer-review-squad requesting a review in the #forum-docs-review channel (CoreOS Slack workspace) and provide the following information:
    * A link to the PR.
    * The size of the PR that the GitHub bot assigns (ex: XS, S, M, L, XL).
    * If there is urgency or a deadline for the review.
  - For community authors: Request a review by tagging @openshift/team-documentation in a GitHub comment.

  Slack is the quickest and preferred way to request a review.

* IMPORTANT:
  - All documentation changes must be verified by a QE team associate before merging.
  - Squash to one commit before submitting your PR for peer review.
