Release notes for the {coo-first}, an optional {ocp-product-title} Operator that enables administrators to create standalone monitoring stacks that are independently configurable for use by different services and users.
The {coo-short} complements the built-in monitoring capabilities of {ocp-product-title}. You can deploy it in parallel with the default platform and user workload monitoring stacks managed by the {cmo-first}.

These release notes track the development of the {coo-full} in {ocp-product-title}.

The following table provides information about which features are available depending on the version of {coo-full} and {ocp-product-title}:
