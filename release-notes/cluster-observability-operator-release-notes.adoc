The following advisory is available for {coo-full} 1.3.1:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2025:23418[RHBA-2025:23418 {coo-full} 1.3.1]

[id="cluster-observability-operator-1-3-1-bug-fixes_{context}"]
=== Bug fixes

Troubleshooting panel accesses custom alerts from user workload monitoring::
Before this update, the Korrel8r troubleshooting panel configuration only included access to the platform monitoring stack in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace. The Korrel8r config map did not include endpoints for the user workload monitoring stack. As a consequence, you could not correlate custom alerts from your applications with related resources through the troubleshooting panel, and queries for custom alerts returned empty results.
+
With this update, the Korrel8r configuration includes access to both platform monitoring and user workload monitoring stacks. As a result, the troubleshooting panel successfully correlates custom alerts from your applications with related resources, providing comprehensive troubleshooting capabilities for both platform and user workload alerts.
+
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-1250[COO-1250]

Logging UI plugin container filter displays matching results::
Before this update, the filter by container dropdown in the Logging UI plugin displayed containers that did not match the search string. As a consequence, you could not effectively filter logs by container name, and the search functionality returned incorrect results that excluded the relevant containers.
+
With this update, the container filter correctly displays only containers that match the search string. As a result, you can accurately filter logs by container name to find relevant log entries.
+
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-1334[COO-1334]

Logging UI plugin preserves JSON format in aggregated logs view::
Before this update, when viewing aggregated logs for a pod in JSON format through the Logging UI plugin, the log format reverted to raw unformatted output after refreshing the view or changing the time interval. As a consequence, you had to manually reapply the JSON format each time you refreshed the view or adjusted the time interval to maintain readable log output.
+
With this update, the Logging UI plugin correctly preserves the JSON format setting in the aggregated logs view, across page refreshes and time interval changes. As a result, you can maintain consistent JSON-formatted log output without needing to reapply the format setting.
+
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-1390[COO-1390]

Alertmanager replication factor can be configured::
Before this update, you could configure the replication factor for Prometheus but not for Alertmanager in the monitoring stack configuration. As a consequence, you could not control Alertmanager high availability settings to match your cluster requirements and had to use the default replication configuration.
+
With this update, you can configure the replication factor for both Prometheus and Alertmanager. As a result, you have consistent control over high availability settings for both components of the monitoring stack.
+
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-15[COO-15]

OpenTelemetry schema option documented in logging schema field::
Before this update, the API documentation for the `UIPlugin` logging schema field did not list the OpenTelemetry (otel) schema as a supported option when querying with `oc explain uiplugin.spec.logging.schema`. Only the `viaq` and `select` options were documented. As a consequence, you could not discover the OpenTelemetry schema option through the API documentation, even though the schema was supported.
+
With this update, the API documentation correctly lists all supported schema options, including OpenTelemetry (otel). As a result, you can discover all available logging schema options through the standard API documentation commands.
+
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-1325[COO-1325]

Prometheus Operator processes PodMonitors with label replacements correctly::
Before this update, the Prometheus Operator incorrectly rejected `PodMonitor` resources that used label replacement configurations with `labelmap` actions. The Operator treated valid replacement patterns as invalid configuration and logged errors stating that the replacement format was invalid for `labelmap` actions. As a consequence, you could not use `PodMonitor` resources with certain label replacement configurations, and affected pod monitors failed to collect metrics.
+
With this update, the Prometheus Operator correctly processes `PodMonitor` resources with label replacement configurations. As a result, you can use label replacements with labelmap actions in your pod monitoring configurations without validation errors.
+
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-1327[COO-1327]

Perses resources are removed during Operator uninstallation::
Before this update, when uninstalling the {coo-full}, Perses-related resources such as pods, services, and stateful sets remained in the Operator namespace after deleting UI plugins and the Operator components. As a consequence, you had to manually remove Perses resources after uninstalling the Operator, and residual resources consumed cluster resources unnecessarily.
+
With this update, the Operator correctly removes all Perses-related resources during uninstallation. As a result, you can cleanly uninstall the Operator without leaving residual resources in the cluster.
+
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-1331[COO-1331]

Logging UI plugin filters namespaces based on selected tenant::
Before this update, the Logging UI plugin displayed all namespaces in the namespace filter dropdown regardless of the selected log tenant type. The plugin did not filter namespaces to show only those relevant to the selected tenant. As a consequence, you saw infrastructure namespaces when viewing application logs and application namespaces when viewing infrastructure logs, making it difficult to find the appropriate namespace for the selected tenant type.
+
With this update, the Logging UI plugin correctly filters namespaces based on the selected tenant. When you select the application tenant, only non-infrastructure namespaces are displayed. When you select the infrastructure tenant, only infrastructure namespaces such as `default`, `openshift`, `openshift-\*`, and `kube-*` are displayed. As a result, you can more easily locate and select the appropriate namespace for your log queries based on the tenant type.
+
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-1367[COO-1367]

OTLP receiver endpoint is enabled in Prometheus when configured::
Before this update, when you enabled the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) receiver in the `MonitoringStack` resource, the OTLP endpoint was not available in Prometheus. The configuration was not properly applied to the `Prometheus` custom resource even though the field is natively supported. As a consequence, you could not ingest OpenTelemetry metrics into Prometheus through the OTLP endpoint despite enabling the receiver in the monitoring stack configuration.
+
With this update, the OTLP receiver configuration from the `MonitoringStack` resource is correctly applied to Prometheus. As a result, you can successfully ingest OpenTelemetry metrics through the OTLP endpoint when the receiver is enabled in your monitoring stack.

[id="cluster-observability-operator-release-notes-1-3_{context}"]
== {coo-full} 1.3

The following advisory is available for {coo-full} 1.3:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:21146[RHSA-2025:21146 {coo-full} 1.3]

[id="cluster-observability-operator-1-3-new-features-enhancements_{context}"]
=== New features and enhancements

Incident detection feature reaches General Availability::
The incident detection feature in the {coo-full} reaches General Availability (GA) status in this release for {ocp-product-title} versions 4.19+. Incident detection simplifies observability by grouping related alerts into incidents. This helps reduce alert fatigue and allows you to focus on the root cause of a problem. With General Availability (GA) status, the incident detection feature is production-ready and fully supported for enterprise deployments. Users can enable incident detection through the monitoring `UIPlugin` resource by setting `spec.monitoring.incidents.enabled: true`.
+
For more information, see xref:../ui_plugins/monitoring-ui-plugin.adoc#coo-incident-detection-overview_monitoring-ui-plugin[Incident detection]
+
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-1281[COO-1281]


Incidents view supports silenced alerts::
The incidents view in the monitoring UI plugin supports silenced alerts in this release. Silenced alerts display with a `state` of `Silenced` in the incident detection UI and appear in a lighter color in the timeline. This helps you to distinguish them from active alerts and to understand the complete state of your cluster observability signals.
+
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-1280[COO-1280]

Troubleshooting reaches General Availability::
The troubleshooting feature in the {coo-full} reaches General Availability (GA) status in this release for {ocp-product-title} versions 4.19+ and is not supported in earlier versions. The troubleshooting UI plugin provides observability signal correlation, powered by the open source Korrel8r project. With the troubleshooting panel you can easily correlate metrics, logs, alerts, netflows, and additional observability signals and resources, across different data stores.
+
For more information, see xref:../ui_plugins/troubleshooting-ui-plugin.adoc#troubleshooting-ui-plugin[Troubleshooting UI plugin]

End-to-end observability with ObservabilityInstaller custom resource::
The {coo-full} provides a `ObservabilityInstaller` custom resource for deploying end-to-end observability with minimal configuration as a Technology Preview feature. The `ObservabilityInstaller` custom resource simplifies the deployment of logging, tracing, and OpenTelemetry capabilities by automatically managing operator installation, storage configuration, and UI integration.

[id="cluster-observability-operator-1-3-bug-fixes_{context}"]
=== Bug fixes

Troubleshooting panel handles {ocp-product-title} 4.19 alert URLs correctly::
Before this update, {ocp-product-title} 4.19 introduced changes to alert URL formatting where some URLs contained only console-internal numeric IDs without alert names. As a consequence, the korrel8r troubleshooting panel failed to process these URLs correctly and could not correlate alerts with related resources.
+
With this update, korrel8r correctly handles alert URLs from {ocp-product-title} 4.19, including URLs that contain only numeric identifiers. As a result, the troubleshooting panel works correctly with all alert types on {ocp-product-title} 4.19 clusters.
+
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-1145[COO-1145]

`UIPlugin` monitoring configuration persists after operator upgrades::
Before this update, when upgrading the {coo-full} from version 1.2.0 to 1.2.1 or later, the monitoring `UIPlugin` configuration was removed during the upgrade process. The `UIPlugin` spec became empty, showing only the plugin type while losing all configuration details such as {rh-rhacm} integration settings, Perses dashboards, and incident management settings. As a consequence, users could not access monitoring dashboards and features after the upgrade, and the operator logged errors stating `monitoring configuration can not be empty for plugin type Monitoring`.
+
With this update, the {coo-full} correctly preserves monitoring `UIPlugin` configuration during upgrades. As a result, monitoring dashboards, {rh-rhacm} integration, and incident management features remain available after operator upgrades without requiring manual reconfiguration.
+
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-1051[COO-1051]

`UIPlugin` status updates correctly in all reconciliation scenarios::
Before this update, the `UIPlugin` controller did not update the custom resource status field in all reconciliation scenarios. The controller failed to update the status when reconciliation errors occurred, causing the status to report success even when configuration changes were not applied. As a consequence, users could not accurately determine the state of `UIPlugin` resources through the status field and had to check the generation field or operator logs to debug issues.
+
With this update, the {coo-full} correctly updates `UIPlugin` status in all reconciliation scenarios, including error conditions. As a result, users can rely on the `UIPlugin` status field to accurately reflect the current state of the resource and troubleshoot configuration issues more effectively.
+
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-1055[COO-1055]

Distributed tracing `UIPlugin` handles double quotes in TraceQL queries::
Before this update, the distributed tracing `UIPlugin` in COO 1.2.2 did not properly handle double quotes in TraceQL query expressions. The query parser failed when attribute values contained double quotes, such as regular expression patterns in HTTP route attributes. As a consequence, users could not query traces with attributes containing double quotes, even when these values were selected from dropdown menus in the user interface.
+
With this update, the {product-title} distributed tracing console plugin correctly processes TraceQL queries containing double quotes in attribute values. As a result, users can query traces with any attribute values, including those containing special characters like double quotes.
+
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-1175[COO-1175]

Logging view plugin proxies to korrel8r only when troubleshooting panel is deployed::
Before this update, the logging view plugin in COO 1.2.1 configured the {product-title} console to proxy traffic to the korrel8r service even when the troubleshooting panel `UIPlugin` was not deployed. The console attempted to connect to a non-existent service, causing permission denied errors. As a consequence, users experienced transient "Missing permissions to get logs" error messages in the logging view, which resolved on their own after 30-60 seconds without user intervention.
+
With this update, the {coo-full} only configures the korrel8r proxy in the logging view plugin when the troubleshooting panel `UIPlugin` is deployed. As a result, users no longer encounter spurious permission errors when viewing logs without the troubleshooting panel.
+
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-1253[COO-1253]

Distributed tracing search field supports keyboard navigation::
Before this update, the distributed tracing console plugin search field did not support keyboard-only navigation. When users typed a filter value and pressed `Enter` to select it, the page reset to the tenant selection screen instead of applying the filter. As a consequence, keyboard-only users could not filter traces by service name or other attributes and were forced to use mouse-based selection.
+
With this update, the {product-title} distributed tracing console plugin correctly handles the `Enter` key in search fields. As a result, users can apply trace filters using keyboard-only navigation, improving accessibility.
+
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-1017[COO-1017]


`UIPlugin` configuration changes remove disabled feature pods::
Before this update, the `UIPlugin` controller in COO 1.2.1 did not remove pods for disabled features when users updated the configuration. When users set `perses.enabled: false` or `incidents.enabled: false` in the `UIPlugin` specification, the associated pods (perses-0 and health-analyzer) continued to run. As a consequence, users could not disable Perses dashboards or incidents features, and the disabled components continued consuming cluster resources.
+
With this update, the {coo-full} correctly removes pods when features are disabled in the `UIPlugin` configuration. As a result, users can enable or disable Perses and incidents features by updating the `UIPlugin` specification, and the associated pods are created or removed accordingly.
+

** Configures ServiceMonitor resource to collect metrics from {coo-short}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-482[*COO-482*])
** Adds `operatorframework.io/cluster-monitoring=true` annotation to the OLM bundle. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-483[*COO-483*])
** Defines the alerting strategy for {coo-short} . (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-484[*COO-484*])
** Configures PrometheusRule for alerting. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-485[*COO-485*])

* Support level annotations have been added to the `UIPlugin` CR when created. The support level is based on the plugin type, with values of `DevPreview`, `TechPreview`, or `GeneralAvailability`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-318[*COO-318*])

// must-gather postponed to 1.1
//* You can now gather debugging information about {coo-short} by using the `oc adm must-gather` CLI command. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-194[*COO-194*])

* You can now configure the Alertmanager `scheme` and `tlsConfig` fields in the Prometheus CR. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-219[*COO-219*])

// Dev preview so cannot document
//* You can now install the Monitoring UI plugin using {coo-short}. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-262[*COO-262*])

* The extended Technical Preview for the troubleshooting panel adds support for correlating traces with Kubernetes resources and directly with other observable signals including logs, alerts, metrics, and network events. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-450[*COO-450*])
** You can select a Tempo instance and tenant when you navigate to the tracing page by clicking *Observe -> Tracing* in the web console. The preview troubleshooting panel only works with the `openshift-tracing / platform` instance and the `platform` tenant.
** The troubleshooting panel works best in the *Administrator* perspective. It has limited functionality in the Developer perspective due to authorization issues with some back ends, most notably Prometheus for metrics and alerts. This will be addressed in a future release.

=== Bug fixes

* Previously, the default namespace for the {coo-short}  installation was `openshift-operators`. With this update, the defaullt namespace changes to `openshift-cluster-observability-operator`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-32[*COO-32*])

* Previously, `korrel8r` was only able to parse time series selector expressions. With this update, `korrel8r` can parse any valid PromQL expression to extract the time series selectors that it uses for correlation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-558[*COO-558*])

* Previously, when viewing a Tempo instance from the Distributed Tracing UI plugin, the scatter plot graph showing the traces duration was not rendered correctly. The bubble size was too large and overlapped the x and y axis. With this update, the graph is rendered correctly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-319[*COO-319*])

[id="cluster-observability-operator-0-1-2-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, certain cluster service version (CSV) annotations were not included in the metadata for {coo-short}.
Because of these missing annotations, certain {coo-short} features and capabilities did not appear in the package manifest or in the OperatorHub user interface.
This release adds the missing annotations, thereby resolving this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-11[*COO-11*])

* Previously, automatic updates of the {coo-short} did not work, and a newer version of the Operator did not automatically replace the older version, even though the newer version was available in OperatorHub.
This release resolves the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-12[*COO-12*])

* Previously, Thanos Querier only listened for network traffic on port 9090 of 127.0.0.1 (`localhost`), which resulted in a `502 Bad Gateway` error if you tried to reach the Thanos Querier service.
With this update, the Thanos Querier configuration has been updated so that the component now listens on the default port (10902), thereby resolving the issue.
As a result of this change, you can also now modify the port via server side apply (SSA) and add a proxy chain, if required. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-14[*COO-14*])
