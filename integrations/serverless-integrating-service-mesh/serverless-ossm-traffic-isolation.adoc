= Using Service Mesh 2.x to isolate network traffic with OpenShift Serverless

:context: serverless-ossm-setup

toc::[]

You can use {SMProductShortName} 2.x with {ServerlessProductName} to control and isolate network traffic between services. This integration helps you define fine-grained communication policies, enhance security through mutual TLS, and manage traffic flow within your serverless environment.

:FeatureName: Using {SMProductShortName} to isolate network traffic with {ServerlessProductName}
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

{SMProductShortName} can be used to isolate network traffic between tenants on a shared {product-title} cluster using Service Mesh `AuthorizationPolicy` resources. {ServerlessProductShortName} can also leverage this, using several {SMProductShortName} resources. A tenant is a group of one or multiple projects that can access each other over the network on a shared cluster.
