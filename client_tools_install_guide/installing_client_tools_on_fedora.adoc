:description: This guide shows you how to install the rhc client tools on your Fedora machine 

toc::[]

== Overview
The OpenShift client tools are supported on Fedora 16 or later and require sudoer or root access. 

[NOTE]
====
The +sudo+ command only works if the particular user is listed in the +sudoers+ file. As an alternative to sudo access, you can activate a root terminal with the +su+ command and the root password. If you activate a root terminal, omit `sudo` from the commands shown in the examples. Be sure to close the root terminal when the installation process is complete. 
====

You can install the client tools on Fedora operating systems by installing the RPM with the YUM package manager, or by installing the gem.


[NOTE]
====
The RPM version of the client tools is not updated as frequently as the gem maintained by the OpenShift development team.

== Installation Issues and Tips for Fedora

*Automatic Completion Using the Tab Key*

The client tools for Fedora support the automatic completion feature of the bash shell. Run the following command and follow the instructions to enable automatic completion:

----
$ rhc setup --autocomplete
----

You may have to close your current terminal session, and open a new session to automatically source the bash completion script. 

If the automatic completion feature is not persistent when you open a new terminal session, the automatic completion script for the client tools must be sourced in the [flename]#.bashrc# file in your home directory. Do this by adding the following line to to your [flename]#.bashrc# file:

----
source /etc/bash_completion.d/rhc
----

When the installation completes, proceed to link:configuring_client_tools.html[configure] the client tools using the interactive setup wizard.
