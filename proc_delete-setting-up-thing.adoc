////
Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
* file name: proc-doing-procedure-a.adoc
* ID: [id="proc-doing-procedure-a_{context}"]
* Title: = Doing procedure A

The ID is an anchor that links to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.

The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.
////

////
Indicate the module type in one of the following
ways:
Add the prefix proc- or proc_ to the file name.
Add the following attribute before the module ID:
////
:_module-type: PROCEDURE

[id="proc_delete-setting-up-thing_{context}"]
= DELETE: Setting up thing
////
Start the title of a procedure module with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.
////

[role="_abstract"]
Write a short introductory paragraph that provides an overview of the module.

Procedure modules should include the steps that users perform and address user motivation.

.Prerequisites

* A bulleted list of conditions that must be satisfied before the user starts following this module.
* You can also link to other modules or assemblies the user must follow before starting this module.
* Delete the section title and bullets if the module has no prerequisites.

.Procedure

. Start each step with an active verb.

. Include one command or action for each step with the exception of simple follow-step, for example:
.. Do this thing and then select *Next*.
.. Do this other thing and then select *Next*.

. Use an unnumbered bullet (*) if the procedure includes only one step.

.Verification
////
Delete this section if it does not apply to your module. Provide the user with verification methods for the procedure, such as expected output or commands that confirm success or failure.
////

. Start each step with an active verb.

. Include one command or action per step.

. Use an unnumbered bullet (*) if the procedure includes only one step.

[role="_additional-resources"]
.Additional resources
////
Optional. Delete if not used.
////
* A bulleted list of links to other closely-related material. These links can include `link:` and `xref:` macros.

* Use a consistent system for file names, IDs, and titles. For tips, see _Anchor Names and File Names_ in link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs#modular-documentation-reference-guide[Modular Documentation Reference Guide].
