You can upgrade to the latest version of {product-title} from a supported older version. For upgrading to {product-title-short} 4.0, you must be using the latest patch release of {product-title-short} 3.74. If you are using an older version, you must first upgrade to {product-title-short} 3.74.

If you have installed {product-title} by using Helm charts, to upgrade to the latest version of {product-title} you must perform the following:

* Backup the Central database.
* (Optional) Optimize Central database and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC).
* (Optional) Generate `values-private.yaml` configuration file containing root certificates for the central-services Helm chart.
* Update the Helm chart.
* Run the `helm upgrade` command.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To ensure optimal functionality, use the same version for your secured-cluster-services Helm chart and central-services Helm chart.
