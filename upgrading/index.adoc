[[upgrading-introduction]]
== Introduction to Upgrading Clusters

When new versions of {product-title} are released, you can upgrade your existing
cluster to apply the latest enhancements and bug fixes.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
For OpenShift Origin, see the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[Releases page] on GitHub to review
the latest changes.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
This includes upgrading from previous minor versions, such as release 3.7 to
3.9, and applying asynchronous errata updates within a minor version (3.9.z
releases). See the xref:../release_notes/ocp_3_9_release_notes.adoc#release-notes-ocp-3-9-release-notes[{product-title} 3.9 Release Notes] to review the latest changes.

[NOTE]
====
Due to the xref:../release_notes/v2_vs_v3.adoc#release-notes-v2-vs-v3[core architectural changes]
between the major versions, OpenShift Enterprise 2 environments cannot be
upgraded to {product-title} 3 and require a fresh installation.
====
endif::[]

Unless noted otherwise, node and masters within a major version are forward and
backward compatible
xref:../upgrading/automated_upgrades.adoc#preparing-for-an-automated-upgrade[across
one minor version], so upgrading your cluster should go smoothly. However, you
should not run mismatched versions longer than necessary to upgrade the entire
cluster.

Before upgrading, ensure that all {product-title} services are running well. Do
not  upgrade {product-title} directly if first upgrade attempt failed. You must
first downgrade.

[IMPORTANT]
====
// tag::37to39skipping38upgrade[]
The {product-title} 3.9 release includes a merge of features and fixes from
Kubernetes 1.8 and 1.9. As a result, the upgrade process from {product-title}
3.7 completes with the cluster fully upgraded to {product-title} 3.9, seemingly
"skipping" the 3.8 release. Technically, the {product-title} 3.7 cluster is
first upgraded to 3.8-versioned packages, and then the process immediately
continues upgrading to {product-title} 3.9 automatically. Your cluster should
only remain at 3.8-versioned packages for as long as it takes to successfully
complete the upgrade to {product-title} 3.9.

[[install-config-upgrading-methods]]
== Upgrade Methods

There are two methods available for performing {product-title} cluster upgrades:
automated or manual.

[[install-config-upgrading-methods-automated]]
=== Automated Method

The automated upgrade method uses Ansible playbooks to automate the tasks needed
to upgrade a {product-title} cluster. You should use the inventory file that you
used during initial installation or during the last time that the upgrade was
successful to run the upgrade playbook. Using this method allows you to choose
between either xref:install-config-upgrading-strategies[upgrade strategy]:
in-place upgrades or blue-green deployments.

[[install-config-upgrading-methods-automated]]
=== Manual Method

The manual upgrade method breaks down the steps that happen during an automated
Ansible-based upgrade and provides the equivalent commands to run manually. Using this method describes the in-place xref:install-config-upgrading-strategies[upgrade strategy].

[[upgrading-swap-memory]]
== Considerations for upgrading with swap memory

If you are upgrading an existing, older version of an {product-title} cluster,
you may have swap memory enabled, whether by having the `openshift_disable_swap`
setting set to `false` in the Ansible inventory file, or manually enabled swap
in the cluster. 

If swap memory is enabled, then the upgrade to {product-title} version 3.9 will
fail. To successfully upgrade to {product-title} version 3.9, ensure swap memory
is disabled by following the
xref:../admin_guide/overcommit.adoc#disabling-swap-memory[Disabling Swap
Memory] section of the Cluster Administration guide.

[[install-config-upgrading-strategies]]
== Upgrade Strategies

When using the automated upgrade method, there are two strategies you can take
for performing the {product-title} cluster upgrade: in-place upgrades or
blue-green delpoyments. When using the manual upgrade method, an in-place
upgrade is described.

[[install-config-upgrading-strategy-inplace]]
=== In-place Upgrades

With in-place upgrades, the cluster upgrade is performed on all hosts in a
single, running cluster: first masters and then nodes. Pods are evacuated off of
nodes and recreated on other running nodes before a node upgrade begins; this
helps reduce downtime of user applications.

If you installed using the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
xref:../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[quick] or
endif::[]
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installation]
and the *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* or inventory file that was
used is available, you can perform an
xref:../upgrading/automated_upgrades.adoc#install-config-upgrading-automated-upgrades[automated in-place upgrade].
Alternatively, you can
xref:../upgrading/manual_upgrades.adoc#install-config-upgrading-manual-upgrades[upgrade in-place manually].

[NOTE]
====
Quick Installation is now deprecated in {product-title} 3.9 and will be
completely removed in a future release.

Quick installation will only be capable of installing 3.9. It will not be able
to upgrade from 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9.
====

[[install-config-upgrading-strategy-bluegreen]]
=== Blue-green Deployments

The
xref:../upgrading/blue_green_deployments.adoc#upgrading-blue-green-deployments[blue-green deployment] upgrade method follows a similar flow to the in-place method:
masters and etcd servers are still upgraded first, however a parallel
environment is created for new nodes instead of upgrading them in-place.

This method allows administrators to switch traffic from the old set of nodes
(e.g., the "blue" deployment) to the new set (e.g., the "green" deployment)
after the new deployment has been verified. If a problem is detected, it is also
then easy to rollback to the old deployment quickly.
