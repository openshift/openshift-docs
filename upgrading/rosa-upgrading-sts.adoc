toc::[]

Use one of the following methods to upgrade ROSA (classic architecture) clusters:

* Manually through the ROSA CLI (`rosa`) - Start a one-time immediate upgrade or schedule a one-time upgrade for a future date or time.
* Manually through the {cluster-manager} UI - Start a one-time immediate upgrade or schedule a one-time upgrade for a future date or time; or schedule an upgrade window for automatic recurring upgrades whenever a new z-version is available.

== Life cycle policies and planning

To plan an upgrade, review the xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-life-cycle.adoc#rosa-life-cycle[{product-title} update life cycle]. The life cycle page includes release definitions, support and upgrade requirements, installation policy information and life cycle dates.

You can use update channels to decide which Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform minor version to update your clusters to. {product-title} supports updates only through the `stable` channel. To learn more about OpenShift update channels and releases, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/updating/understanding_updates/understanding-update-channels-release.html[Understanding update channels and releases].

== Upgrading a ROSA Classic cluster

You must upgrade ROSA (classic architecture) clusters using either the ROSA CLI (`rosa`) or the {cluster-manager} console.

[NOTE]
====
The actual start time of the cluster upgrade will be within one hour of the upgrade schedule time. Additionally, the duration of the upgrade might vary based on your workload configuration.
====

When a ROSA (classic architecture) cluster that uses AWS Security Token Services (STS) is upgraded, the ROSA CLI verifies the account and Operator role policies for the chosen cluster are compatible with the target version of the upgrade. If the policies are compatible, the CLI automatically upgrades the cluster. If the policies are not compatible with the chosen upgrade version, the CLI automatically upgrades IAM policies before upgrading the cluster. When scheduling the upgrade, you give administrative acknowledgment to confirm you have reviewed the changes involved with the upgrade, if required.
