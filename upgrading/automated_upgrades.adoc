If you installed using the standard
xref:../install/index.adoc#instal-planning[cluster installation] process, and
the inventory file that was used is available, you can use upgrade playbooks to
automate the cluster upgrade process.

To upgrade {product-title}, you run Ansible playbooks with the same inventory
file that you used during installation. You run the same *_v3_11_* upgrade
playbooks to:

- Upgrade existing {product-title} version 3.10 clusters to version 3.11.
- Upgrade {product-title} version 3.11 clusters to the latest
xref:../release_notes/ocp_3_11_release_notes.adoc#ocp-311-asynchronous-errata-updates[asynchronous
errata update].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Running Ansible playbooks with the `--tags` or `--check` options is not supported by Red Hat.

[[upgrade-workflow]]
== Upgrade workflow

The 3.10 to 3.11 control plane upgrade performs the following steps for
you:

* Back up all etcd data for recovery purposes.
* Update the API and controllers from 3.10 to 3.11.
* Update internal data structures to 3.11.
* Update the default router, if one exists, from 3.10 to 3.11.
* Update the default registry, if one exists, from 3.10 to 3.11.
* Update the default image streams and InstantApp templates.

The 3.10 to 3.11 node upgrade performs a rolling update of nodes, which:

* Marks a subset of nodes unschedulable and drains them of pods.
* Updates node components from 3.10 to 3.11.
* Returns those nodes to service.

[[upgrade-prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

Before you upgrade your cluster:

* Review the
xref:../release_notes/ocp_3_11_release_notes.adoc#release-notes-ocp-3-11-release-notes[{product-title} 3.11 Release Notes].
The release notes contain important notices about changes to {product-title} and
its function.

* If you are completing a large-scale upgrade, which involves at least 10 worker
nodes and thousands of projects and pods, review
xref:special-considerations-for-large-scale-upgrades[Special considerations for
large-scale upgrades] to prevent upgrade failures.

* Upgrade the cluster to the
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.10/release_notes/ocp_3_10_release_notes.html#ocp-3-10-45[latest asynchronous release of version 3.10].
If your cluster is at a version earlier
than 3.10, you must first upgrade incrementally. For example, upgrade from 3.7
to 3.9 (the 3.8 version was link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.9/release_notes/ocp_3_9_release_notes.html#ocp-39-about-this-release[skipped]),
and then from 3.9 to 3.10.

* Run the
xref:../day_two_guide/environment_health_checks.adoc#day-two-environment-health-checks[Environment
health checks] to verify the cluster's health. In this process, you confirm that
the nodes are in the *Ready* state and running the expected starting version and
that there are no diagnostic errors or warnings.

* Ensure that your cluster meets the current
xref:../install/prerequisites.adoc#install-config-install-prerequisites[prerequisites]
If it does not, your upgrade might fail.

* The day before the upgrade, validate {product-title} storage migration to ensure
potential issues are resolved before the outage window:
+
----
$ oc adm migrate storage --include=* --loglevel=2 --confirm --config /etc/origin/master/admin.kubeconfig
----

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[[running-upgrade-playbooks]]
== Upgrading OKD

To upgrade OKD:
. Check out the latest *openshift-ansible* code:
+
----
# cd ~/openshift-ansible
# git pull https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible master
----

. Run the correct upgrade playbook. Use the same inventory file that you used to
install OKD. If your inventory file is not in the *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*
directory, add the `-i` flag and specify the location.
.. To upgrade to a new OKD minor version, run:
+
----
# ansible-playbook \
    -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/<version>/upgrade.yml
----
.. To upgrade to the latest z-stream version of a minor release, such as 3.11.z,
run:
+
----
# ansible-playbook \
    -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/<version>/upgrade.yml
----

. After all master and node upgrades have completed, reboot all hosts.

[[preparing-for-an-automated-upgrade]]
== Preparing for an upgrade

After you satisfy the prerequisites, prepare for an automated upgrade:

. Pull the latest subscription data from Red Hat Subscription Manager:
+
----
# subscription-manager refresh
----

. If you are upgrading from {product-title} 3.10 to 3.11:

.. Back up the files that you need if you must downgrade to {product-title}
3.10:

... On master hosts, back up the following files:
+
----
/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml
/etc/origin/master/master.env
/etc/origin/master/scheduler.json
----

... On node hosts, including masters, back up the following files:
+
----
/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml
----

... On etcd hosts, including masters that have etcd co-located on them, back up
the following file:
+
----
/etc/etcd/etcd.conf
----

.. The upgrade process creates a backup of all etcd data for recovery purposes,
but ensure that you have a recent etcd backup at
*_/backup/etcd-xxxxxx/backup.db_* before continuing. Manual etcd backup steps
are described in the
xref:../day_two_guide/environment_backup.adoc#etcd-backup_environment-backup[Day Two Operations Guide].
+
[NOTE]
====
When you upgrade {product-title}, your etcd configuration does not change.
Whether you run etcd as static pods on master hosts or as a separate service on
master hosts or separate hosts does not change after you upgrade.
====

.. Manually disable the 3.10 repository and enable the 3.11 repository on each
master and node host. You must also enable the *rhel-7-server-ansible-2.8-rpms*
repository, if it is not already enabled:
+

*** For cloud installations and on-premise installations on x86_64 servers,
run the following command:
+
----

    --enable="rhel-7-server-for-power-9-rhscl-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-for-power-9-ose-3.11-rpms"
# yum clean all
----

.. Ensure that you have the latest version of the *openshift-ansible* package on
the host you run the upgrade playbooks on:
+
----
# yum update -y openshift-ansible
----

.. Prepare for the Cluster Monitoring Operator. In version 3.11, the Cluster
Monitoring Operator is installed on an infrastructure node by default. If your
cluster does not use infrastructure nodes:
*** xref:../install_config/adding_hosts_to_existing_cluster.adoc#install-config-adding-hosts-to-cluster[Add]
an infrastructure node to your cluster.
*** Disable the Cluster Monitoring Operator by adding
`openshift_cluster_monitoring_operator_install=false` to your inventory file.
*** Specify which node to install the Cluster Monitoring Operator on by
xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#updating-labels-on-nodes[marking it]
with the `openshift_cluster_monitoring_operator_node_selector`.

.. If you use the standard {product-title} registry, prepare for the change from
`registry.access.redhat.com` to `registry.redhat.io`. Complete the configuration
steps in
xref:../install_config/configuring_red_hat_registry.adoc#install-config-configuring-red-hat-registry[Accessing and Configuring the Red Hat Registry].

. Review and update your
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-ansible[inventory file].

.. Ensure that any manual configuration changes you made to your master or node
configuration files since your last Ansible playbook run, whether that was
initial installation or your most recent cluster upgrade, are in the inventory
file. For any variables that are relevant to the manual
changes you made, apply the equivalent appropriate changes to your inventory
files before running the upgrade. Otherwise, your manual changes might be
overwritten by default values during the upgrade, which could cause pods to not
run properly or other cluster stability issues.
.. By default, the installer checks to see if your certificates will expire
within a year and fails if they will expire within that time. To change the
number of days that your certificate is valid, specify a new value for the
`openshift_certificate_expiry_warning_days` parameter. For example, to ensure
that your certificates are valid for 180 days, specify
`openshift_certificate_expiry_warning_days=180`.
.. To skip checking if your certificates will expire, set
`openshift_certificate_expiry_fail_on_warn=False`.
.. If you made any changes to `admissionConfig` settings in your
master configuration files, review the
`openshift_master_admission_plugin_config` variable in
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-ansible[Configuring
Your Inventory File]. Failure to do so might cause pods to get stuck in
`Pending` state if you had `ClusterResourceOverride` settings manually
configured previously, as described in
xref:../admin_guide/overcommit.adoc#configuring-masters-for-overcommitment[Configuring Masters for Overcommitment].
.. If you used the `openshift_hostname` parameter in versions of {product-title}
before 3.10, ensure that the `openshift_kubelet_name_override` parameter is
still in your inventory file and set to the value of `openshift_hostname` that
you used in previous versions.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must not remove the `openshift_kubelet_name_override` parameter from your
inventory file after you upgrade.
====
.. If you manually manage the cluster's *_/etc/origin/master/htpasswd_* file,
add `openshift_master_manage_htpasswd=false` to your inventory file to prevent
the upgrade process from overwriting the *_htpasswd_* file.



[[updating-policy-definitions]]
=== Updating policy definitions

During a cluster upgrade, and on every restart of any master, the
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[default
cluster roles] are automatically reconciled to restore any missing permissions.

. If you customized default cluster roles and want to ensure a role reconciliation
does not modify them, protect each role from reconciliation:
+
----
$ oc annotate clusterrole.rbac <role_name> --overwrite rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate=false
----
+
[WARNING]
====
You must manually update the roles that contain this setting to include any new
or required permissions after upgrading.
====

. Generate a default bootstrap policy template file:
+
----
$ oc adm create-bootstrap-policy-file --filename=policy.json
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The contents of the file vary based on the {product-title} version, but the file
contains only the default policies.
====

. Update the *_policy.json_* file to include any cluster role customizations.

. Use the policy file to automatically reconcile roles and role bindings that
are not reconcile protected:
+
----
$ oc auth reconcile -f policy.json
----

. Reconcile security context constraints:
+
----
# oc adm policy reconcile-sccs \
    --additive-only=true \
    --confirm
----

[[upgrading-control-plane-nodes-separate-phases]]
=== Upgrade phases

You can upgrade the {product-title} cluster in one or more phases. You can choose
to upgrade all hosts in one phase by running a single Ansible playbook
or upgrade the _control plane_, or master components, and nodes in multiple phases
using separate playbooks.

[NOTE]
====
If your {product-title} cluster uses GlusterFS pods, you must perform the upgrade in multiple phases.
See xref:special-considerations-for-glusterfs[Special Considerations When Using Containerized GlusterFS] for details on how to upgrade with GlusterFS.
====

When upgrading in separate phases, the control plane phase includes upgrading:

- Master components
- Node services running on masters
- Docker or CRI-O running on masters
- Docker or CRI-O running on any stand-alone etcd hosts

If you upgrade only the nodes, you must first upgrade the control plane. The
node phase includes upgrading:

- Node services running on stand-alone nodes
- Docker or CRI-O running on stand-alone nodes

Nodes that run master components are upgraded only during the control plane upgrade
phase. This ensures that the node services and container engines on masters are not
upgraded twice, once during the control plane phase and again during the node
phase.

[[customizing-node-upgrades]]
=== Node upgrade parameters

Whether you upgrade in a single or multiple phases, you can customize how the node
portion of the upgrade progresses by passing certain Ansible variables to an
upgrade playbook using the `-e` option.

* Set the `openshift_upgrade_nodes_serial` variable to an integer or
percentage to control how many node hosts are upgraded at the same time. The
default is `1`, which upgrades one node at a time.
+
For example, to upgrade 20 percent of the total number of detected nodes at a
time, run:
+
----
$ ansible-playbook -i <path/to/inventory/file> \
    </path/to/upgrade/playbook> \
    -e openshift_upgrade_nodes_serial="20%"
----

* Set the `openshift_upgrade_nodes_label` to specify that only nodes with a
certain label are upgraded.
+
For example, to only upgrade nodes in the *group1* region, two at a time:
+
----
$ ansible-playbook -i <path/to/inventory/file> \
    </path/to/upgrade/playbook> \
    -e openshift_upgrade_nodes_serial="2" \
    -e openshift_upgrade_nodes_label="region=group1"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
See xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#updating-labels-on-nodes[Managing
Nodes] for more information about node labels.
====

* Set the `openshift_upgrade_nodes_max_fail_percentage` variable to specify
how many nodes can fail in each batch of upgrades. If the percentage of failed
nodes exceeds your value, the playbook stops the upgrade process.

* Set the `openshift_upgrade_nodes_drain_timeout` variable to specify the
length of time to wait before marking a node as failed.
+
In this example, 10 nodes are upgraded at a time, the upgrade stops if more
than 20 percent of the nodes fail, and a node is marked as failed if it takes
more than 600 seconds to drain the node:
+
----
$ ansible-playbook -i <path/to/inventory/file> \
    </path/to/upgrade/playbook> \
    -e openshift_upgrade_nodes_serial=10 \
    -e openshift_upgrade_nodes_max_fail_percentage=20 \
    -e openshift_upgrade_nodes_drain_timeout=600
----

[[upgrade-hooks]]
=== Ansible hooks for upgrades

When upgrading {product-title}, you can execute custom tasks during specific
operations through a system called _hooks_. Hooks allow cluster administrators
to provide files defining tasks to execute before or after specific areas
during upgrades. You can use hooks to validate or modify custom
infrastructure when upgrading {product-title}.

Because when a hook fails, the operation fail, design hooks that are idempotent,
or can run multiple times and provide the same results.

[[upgrade-hooks-limitations]]
==== Limitations

- Hooks have no defined or versioned interface. They can use internal
*openshift-ansible* variables, but there is no guarantee these variables will
remain in
future releases. In the future, hooks might be versioned, giving you advance
warning that your hook needs to be updated to work with the latest
*openshift-ansible*.
- Hooks have no error handling, so an error in a hook halts the upgrade
process. If you get an error, you must address the problem and then start the
upgrade again.
- You can run node upgrade hooks on only nodes, not masters. To run the hooks on
masters, you must specify a master hook for those nodes.

[[upgrade-hooks-using-hooks]]
==== Using hooks

You define hooks in the *_hosts_* inventory file under the `OSEv3:vars`
section.

Each hook must point to a YAML file that defines Ansible tasks. This file is
used as an _include_, meaning that the file cannot be a playbook, but is a set
of tasks. Best practice suggests using absolute paths to the hook file to avoid
any ambiguity.

.Example hook definitions in an inventory file

[[special-considerations-for-upgrade]]
=== Special considerations for upgrading {product-title}

If your {product-title} cluster uses a mixed environment or gcePD storage,
you need to take more steps before you upgrade it.

Before you upgrade a mixed environment, such as one with Red Hat Enterprise
Linux (RHEL) and RHEL Atomic Host, set values in the inventory file for both the
`openshift_pkg_version` and `openshift_image_tag` parameters. Setting these
values ensures that all nodes in your cluster run the same version of
{product-title}. While this is a best practice for major updates, such as from
{product-title} 2 to {product-title} 3, setting these values are mandatory
for minor version upgrades.

For example, to upgrade from {product-title}
3.9 to {product-title} 3.10, set the following parameters and values:

----
openshift_pkg_version=-3.10.16
openshift_image_tag=v3.10.16
----

[NOTE]
====
These parameters can also be present in other, non-mixed, environments.
====

[[special-considerations-for-large-scale-upgrades]]
==== Special considerations for large-scale upgrades

For large-scale cluster upgrades, which involve at least 10 worker nodes and
thousands of projects and pods, the API object storage migration should be
performed prior to running the upgrade playbooks, and then again after the
upgrade has successfully completed. Otherwise, the upgrade process will fail.

Refer to the *Running the pre- and post- API server model object migration
outside of the upgrade window* section of the
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/3208381[Recommendations for large-scale
OpenShift upgrades] for further guidance.

[[special-considerations-for-gcepd]]
==== Special considerations when using gcePD
Because the default gcePD storage provider uses an RWO (Read-Write Only) access
mode, you cannot perform a rolling upgrade on the registry or scale the registry
to multiple pods. Therefore, when upgrading {product-title}, you must specify
the following environment variables in your Ansible inventory file:

----
[OSEv3:vars]

openshift_hosted_registry_storage_provider=gcs
openshift_hosted_registry_storage_gcs_bucket=bucket01
openshift_hosted_registry_storage_gcs_keyfile=test.key
openshift_hosted_registry_storage_gcs_rootdirectory=/registry
----

[[upgrading-ocp]]
== Upgrading to the latest {product-title} release

To upgrade an existing {product-title} 3.10 or 3.11 cluster to the latest 3.11
release:

. xref:preparing-for-an-automated-upgrade[Prepare for an upgrade]
to ensure you use the latest upgrade playbooks.

. Ensure the `openshift_deployment_type` parameter in your inventory file is set
to `openshift-enterprise`.

. To enable rolling, full system restarts of the hosts, set the
`openshift_rolling_restart_mode` parameter in your inventory file to `system`.
Otherwise, the service is restarted on masters, but the systems do not reboot.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `openshift_rolling_restart_mode` only works for master hosts.
====
+
See xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-cluster-variables[Configuring
Cluster Variables] for details.

. If you modified the `oreg_url` parameter to change the cluster image registry location,
you must run the `imageconfig` playbook to update the image location:
+
----
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible
$ ansible-playbook -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    playbooks/openshift-node/imageconfig.yml \
----

. Upgrade your nodes.
+
If your inventory file is located somewhere other than the default
*_/etc/ansible/hosts_*, add the `-i` flag to specify its location. If you
previously used the `atomic-openshift-installer` command to run your
installation, you can check *_~/.config/openshift/hosts_* for the last inventory
file that was used.

** To upgrade control plane and nodes in a single phase, run the *_upgrade.yml_*
playbook:
+
----
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible
$ ansible-playbook -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_11/upgrade.yml
----

** To upgrade the control plane and nodes in separate phases:
.. Upgrade the control plane by running the *_upgrade_control_plane.yaml_*
playbook:
+
----
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible
$ ansible-playbook -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_11/upgrade_control_plane.yml
----

.. Upgrade the nodes by running the *_upgrade_nodes.yaml_* playbook:
+
----
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible
$ ansible-playbook -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_11/upgrade_nodes.yml \
    [-e <customized_node_upgrade_variables>] <1>
----
<1> See xref:customizing-node-upgrades[Customizing Node Upgrades] for any desired
`<customized_node_upgrade_variables>`.
+
If you are upgrading the nodes in groups as described in
xref:customizing-node-upgrades[Customizing Node Upgrades], continue running the
*_upgrade_nodes.yml_* playbook until all nodes are upgraded.
// tag::automated_upgrade_after_reboot[]

. If you did not enable automated reboot of the master hosts by using `openshift_rolling_restart variable=system` in step 3 of this procedure, you can manually reboot all master hosts together with all node hosts after the upgrade has completed. Rebooting the hosts is optional.

. If you use aggregated logging, xref:upgrading-efk-logging-stack[upgrade the EFK logging stack].

. If you use cluster metrics, xref:upgrading-cluster-metrics[upgrade cluster metrics].

. xref:verifying-the-upgrade[Verify the upgrade].

[[special-considerations-for-glusterfs]]
== Upgrading {product-title} when using containerized GlusterFS

When upgrading {product-title}, you must upgrade the set of nodes where
GlusterFS pods run. However, because these pods run as part of a daemonset, you
cannot use `drain` or `unschedule` commands to terminate and evacuate the
GlusterFS pods. To avoid data availability and cluster corruption, you must also
upgrade nodes that host GlusterFS pods one at a time to ensure that the upgrade
process completes on a node that runs GlusterFS before the upgrade starts on the
next node.

To upgrade {product-title} if you use containerized GlusterFS:

. xref:upgrading-control-plane-nodes-separate-phases[Upgrade the control plane]
(the master nodes and etcd nodes).

. Upgrade standard `infra` nodes (router, registry, logging, and metrics).

[[upgrading-optional-components]]
== Upgrading optional components

If you installed an EFK logging stack or cluster metrics, you must separately
upgrade the component.

[[upgrading-efk-logging-stack]]
=== Upgrading the EFK Logging Stack

To upgrade an existing EFK logging stack deployment, you review your parameters
and run the *_openshift-logging/config.yml_* playbook.

The EFK upgrade also upgrades Elasticsearch from version 2 to version 5. For important information on changes in Elasticsearch 5, you should review the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.5/breaking-changes-5.0.html[Elasticsearch breaking changes].

It is important to note that Elasticsearch 5 has some significant changes to the index structures. Previously, Elasticsearch permitted a dot character, `.`, in field names.
In version 5, Elasticsearch interprets any dot in an Elasticsearch field name as nested structure. If you have a field with a dot, the string after the dot is interpreted as the type of field, leading to mapping conflicts during the upgrade. 

To help identify potential conflicts, {product-title} provides a script that examines your Elasticsearch fields to determine if any fields contain a dot in the name.

For example, the following fields were allowed in Elasticsearch 2:

----
{
  "field": 123  // "field" is of type number
}

// Any dot in field name is treated as any other valid character in the field name.
// It is just part of the field name.
{
  "field.name": "Bob"  // "field.name" is of type String 
----

In Elasticsearch 5 and higher the `field` string would become the field and the `name` string would become a type for the field: 

----
{
  "field": 123  // "field" is of type number
}

// Any dot in field name is always interpreted as nested structure.
{
  "field" : {  // "field" is of type Object
    "name": "Bob"  // "name" is of type String
  }
}
----

Upgrading in this case would result in the `field` field having two different types, which is not permitted. 

If you need to keep these conflicting indices, you need to reindex the data and change the documents to get rid of conflicting data structure. For more information, see link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.4/dots-in-names.html#_upgrading_fields_with_dots_to_5_x[Upgrading fields with dots to 5.x]. 

[[upgrading-efk-logging-stack-script]]
==== Determining if fields have dots in field names

You can run the following script to determine if your indices contain any fields with a dot in the name.

[NOTE]
====
The following command uses the `jq` JSON processor to get directly at the necessary data. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), depending on version, might not provide a package for `jq`. You might need to install this from external sources, or unsupported locations.
====

----
oc exec -c elasticsearch -n $LOGGING_NS $pod -- es_util --query='_mapping?pretty&filter_path=**.mappings.*.properties' \
  | jq '.[].mappings[].properties | keys' \
  | jq .[] \
  | egrep -e "\."
----

The upgrade path depends on whether the indices xref:upgrading-efk-logging-stack-dots[have fields with dots] or xref:upgrading-efk-logging-stack-nodots[do not have fields with dots]. 

[[upgrading-efk-logging-stack-dots]]
==== Upgrading if fields have dots in field names

If the xref:upgrading-efk-logging-stack-script[script above] indicates your indices contain fields with a dot in the name, use the following steps to correct this issue and upgrade. 

To upgrade your EFK stack:

. Review how to
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#aggregate-logging-ansible-variables[specify logging Ansible variables]
and update your Ansible inventory file to at least set the
following required variable in the `[OSEv3:vars]` section:
+
----
[OSEv3:vars]

openshift_logging_install_logging=true <1>
----
<1> Enables the ability to upgrade the logging stack.

. Update any other `openshift_logging_*` variables that you want to override the
default values for, as described in
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#aggregate-logging-ansible-variables[Specifying Logging Ansible Variables].
+
You can set the `openshift_logging_elasticsearch_replace_configmap` parameter to `true` to replace your
`logging-elasticsearch` ConfigMap  with the current default values. In some cases, using an older
ConfigMap can cause the upgrade to fail. The default is set to `false`. For more information, see the parameter
in xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#aggregate-logging-ansible-variables[specify logging Ansible variables].

. Dechedule your Fluentd pods to stop data ingestion and ensure the cluster state does not change.
+
For example, you can change the node selector in Fluentd pods to one that does not match any nodes.
+
----
oc patch daemonset logging-fluentd -p '{"spec": {"template": {"spec": {"nodeSelector": {"non-existing": "true"}}}}}'
----

. Perform an link: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.4/indices-flush.html[Elasticsearch Index flush] on all relevant indices. The flush process persists all logs from memory to disk, which prevents log loss when Elasticsearch is shutdown during the upgrade.

. Perform an online or offline backup:

* Perform an link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-snapshots.html[online backup] of specific Elasticsearch indices the entire cluster.

* Perform an offline backup: 

.. Scale down all Elasticsearch DaemonSets to `0`:
+
----
$ oc scale dc <name> -n openshift-logging --replicas=0
----

.. Backup external persistent volumes using the appropriate method for your organization.

. For any file name with a dot character, you need to take one of the following actions before upgrading:
+
* Deleting the indices. This is the better approach to avoid mapping conflicts during the upgrade.
* Reindexing the data and changing the documents to get rid of conflicting data structure. This method retain the data.   
For information on potential mapping conflicts see link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.5/breaking_50_mapping_changes.html[Mappging changes] in the Elasticsearch documentation.

. Repeat the on-line or offline backup.

. Run the *_openshift-logging/config.yml_* playbook according to the
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#deploying-the-efk-stack[deploying
the EFK stack] instructions to complete the logging upgrade. You run the
installation playbook for the new {product-title} version to upgrade the
logging deployment.

[[upgrading-efk-logging-stack-nodots]]
==== Upgrading if fields do not have dots

If the xref:upgrading-efk-logging-stack-script[script above] indicates your indices do not contain fields with a dot in the name, use the following steps to upgrade. 

. Optionally, dechedule your Fluentd pods and scale down your Elasticsearch pods to stop data ingestion and ensure the cluster state does not change.
+
For example, you can change the node selector in Fluentd pods to one that does not match any nodes.
+
----
oc patch daemonset logging-fluentd -p '{"spec": {"template": {"spec": {"nodeSelector": {"non-existing": "true"}}}}}'
----

. Optionally, perform and online or offline backup:

* Perform an link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-snapshots.html[online backup] of specific Elasticsearch indices the entire cluster.

* Perform an offline backup: 

.. Scale down all Elasticsearch DeploymentConfigs to `0`:
+
----
$ oc scale dc <name> -n openshift-sdn --replicas=0
----

.. Backup external persistent volumes using the appropriate method for your organization.

. Run the *_openshift-logging/config.yml_* playbook according to the
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#deploying-the-efk-stack[deploying
the EFK stack] instructions to complete the logging upgrade. You run the
installation playbook for the new {product-title} version to upgrade the
logging deployment.

. Optionally, use the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.5/modules-snapshots.html[Elasticsearch restore module] to restore your Elasticsearch indices from the snapshot.

[[upgrading-cluster-metrics]]
=== Upgrading cluster metrics

To upgrade an existing cluster metrics deployment, you review your parameters
and run the *_openshift-metrics/config.yml_* playbook.

. Review how to
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-ansible-variables[specify
metrics Ansible variables]
and update your Ansible inventory file to at least set the
following required variable in the `[OSEv3:vars]` section:
+
----
[OSEv3:vars]

openshift_metrics_install_metrics=true <1>
openshift_metrics_hawkular_hostname=<fqdn> <2>
openshift_metrics_cassandra_storage_type=(emptydir|pv|dynamic) <3>
----
<1> Enables the ability to upgrade the metrics deployment.
<2> Used for the Hawkular Metrics route. Specify a fully qualified
domain name.
<3> Specify the same type as the previous deployment.

. Update any other `openshift_metrics_*` variables that you want to override the
default values for, as described in
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-ansible-variables[Specifying
Metrics Ansible Variables].

. Run the *_openshift-metrics/config.yml_* playbook according to the
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#deploying-the-metrics-components[deploying
the metrics deployment] instructions to complete the metrics upgrade. You run the
installation playbook for the new {product-title} version to upgrade the
logging deployment.

[[verifying-the-upgrade]]
== Verifying the upgrade

Ensure that:

* The cluster is healthy.
* The master, node, and etcd services or static pods are running well.
* The {product-title}, `docker-registry`, and router versions are correct.
* The original applications are still available, and new application can be created.
* Running `oc adm diagnostics` produces no errors.

To verify the upgrade:

. Check that all nodes are marked as *Ready*:
+
----
# oc get nodes
NAME                     STATUS    ROLES        AGE       VERSION
master1.example.com      Ready     master       47d       v1.11.0+d4cacc0
master2.example.com      Ready     master       47d       v1.11.0+d4cacc0
master3.example.com      Ready     master       47d       v1.11.0+d4cacc0
infra-node1.example.com  Ready     infra        47d       v1.11.0+d4cacc0
infra-node2.example.com  Ready     infra        47d       v1.11.0+d4cacc0
node1.example.com        Ready     compute      47d       v1.11.0+d4cacc0
node2.example.com        Ready     compute      47d       v1.11.0+d4cacc0
----

. Verify that the static pods for the control plane are running:
+
----
# oc get pods -n kube-system
NAME                                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
master-api-master1.example.com           1/1       Running   4          1h
master-controllers-master1.example.com   1/1       Running   3          1h
master-etcd-master1.example.com          1/1       Running   6          5d
[...]
----

. Verify that you are running the expected versions of the *docker-registry*
and *router* images, if deployed:
+
[subs=attributes+]
----
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# oc get -n default dc/docker-registry -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift3/ose-docker-registry:{latest-short-tag}",
# oc get -n default dc/router -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift3/ose-haproxy-router:{latest-short-tag}",
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# oc get -n default dc/docker-registry -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift/origin-docker-registry:{latest-short-tag}",
# oc get -n default dc/router -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift/origin-haproxy-router:{latest-short-tag}",
endif::[]
----

. Use the diagnostics tool on the master to look for common issues:
+
----
# oc adm diagnostics
