== Overview

If you installed by using the
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installation]
and the inventory file that was used is available, you can use the upgrade
playbook to automate the OpenShift cluster upgrade process.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
If you installed using the
xref:../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[quick installation] method
and a *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* file is available, you can use
the quick installer to perform the automated upgrade.
endif::[]

The automated upgrade performs the following steps for you:

* Applies the latest configuration.
* Upgrades master and etcd components and restarts services.
* Upgrades node components and restarts services.
* Applies the latest cluster policies.
* Updates the default router if one exists.
* Updates the default registry if one exists.
* Updates default image streams and InstantApp templates.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Ensure that you have met all
xref:../install_config/install/prerequisites.adoc#install-config-install-prerequisites[prerequisites]
before proceeding with an upgrade. Failure to do so can result in a failed
upgrade.

* If you are using GlusterFS, see
xref:special-considerations-for-glusterfs[Special Considerations When Using
Containerized GlusterFS] before proceeding.

* If you are using GCE Persistent Disk (gcePD), see xref:special-considerations-for-gcepd[Special Considerations When Using
gcePD] before proceeding.

== Running Upgrade Playbooks

Ensure that you have the latest *openshift-ansible* code checked out:

----
# cd ~/openshift-ansible
# git pull https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible master
----

Then run one of the following upgrade playbooks utilizing the inventory file you
used during the advanced installation. If your inventory file is located
somewhere other than the default *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*, add the `-i` flag to
specify the location.

[[upgrading-to-openshift-origin-1-1]]
=== Upgrading to OpenShift Origin 1.1

To upgrade from OpenShift Origin 1.0 to 1.1, run the following playbook:

----
# ansible-playbook \
    -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_0_to_v3_1/upgrade.yml
----

[NOTE]
====
The *_v3_0_to_v3_1_* in the above path is a reference to the related OpenShift
Enterprise versions, however it is also the correct playbook to use when
upgrading from OpenShift Origin 1.0 to 1.1.
====

When the upgrade finishes, a recommendation will be printed to reboot all hosts.
After rebooting, continue to Updating Master and Node Certificates.

[[upgrading-to-openshift-origin-1-1-z-releases]]
=== Upgrading to OpenShift Origin 1.1.z Releases

To upgrade an existing OpenShift Origin 1.1 cluster to the latest 1.1.z release,
run the following playbook:

----
# ansible-playbook \
    -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_1_minor/upgrade.yml
----

[NOTE]
====
The *v3_1_minor* in the above path is a reference to the related OpenShift
Enterprise versions, however it is also the correct playbook to use when
upgrading from OpenShift Origin 1.1 to the latest 1.1.z release.
====

When the upgrade finishes, a recommendation will be printed to reboot all hosts.
After rebooting, continue to xref:verifying-the-upgrade[Verifying the Upgrade].

[[preparing-for-an-automated-upgrade]]
== Preparing for an Automated Upgrade

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before upgrading your cluster to {product-title} 3.7, the cluster must be
already upgraded to the
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/release_notes/ocp_3_6_release_notes.html#ocp-36-asynchronous-errata-updates[latest asynchronous release of version 3.6]. Cluster upgrades cannot span more than one
minor version at a time, so if your cluster is at a version earlier than 3.6,
you must first upgrade incrementally (e.g., 3.4 to 3.5, then 3.5 to 3.6).
====

[NOTE]
====
Before attempting the upgrade, follow the steps in
xref:verifying-the-upgrade[Verifying the Upgrade] to verify the cluster's
health. This will confirm that nodes are in the *Ready* state, running the
expected starting version, and will ensure that there are no diagnostic errors
or warnings.
====

To prepare for an automated upgrade:

. Pull the latest subscription data from RHSM:
+
----
# subscription-manager refresh
----

. If you are upgrading from {product-title} 3.6 to 3.7, manually disable the 3.6
channel and enable the 3.7 channel on each master and node host:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --disable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.6-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.7-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-fast-datapath-rpms"
# yum clean all
----

. For any upgrade path, always ensure that you have the latest version of the
*atomic-openshift-utils* package on each RHEL 7 system, which also updates the
*openshift-ansible-** packages:
+
----
# yum update atomic-openshift-utils
----

. Before upgrading to {product-title} 3.7, your cluster must be using external etcd (not embedded) and its data must be using the v3 data model:

.. Starting in {product-title} 3.7, embedded etcd is no longer supported. If you
have an {product-title} 3.6 cluster that is using an embeded etcd, you must run
a playbook to migrate it to external etcd. See
xref:../upgrading/migrating_embedded_etcd.adoc#install-config-upgrading-etcd-data-migration[Migrating Embedded etcd to External etcd] for steps.

.. If your cluster was initially installed using *openshift-ansible* version
3.6.173.0.21 or later, your etcd data is already using the v3 model. If it was
upgraded from {product-title} 3.5 to 3.6 before then, you must run a playbook to
migrate the data from the v2 model to v3. See
xref:../upgrading/migrating_etcd.adoc#install-config-upgrading-etcd-data-migration[Migrating etcd Data (v2 to v3)] for steps.

////
((Steps removed per QE feedback))

. When installing or updating *atomic-openshift-utils*,
*_/usr/share/openshift/examples/_*  does not get updated with the latest
templates. To update these files:
+
----
# mkdir /usr/share/openshift/examples
# cp -R /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v3.7/* /usr/share/openshift/examples/
----

. To persist *_/usr/share/openshift/examples/_* on all masters:
+
----
# mkdir /usr/share/openshift/examples
# scp -R /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v3.7/* \
    user@masterx:/usr/share/openshift/examples
----

. You must be logged in as a cluster administrative user on the master host for
the upgrade to succeed:
+
----
$ oc login
----
////

After satisfying these steps, there are two methods for running the automated
upgrade:

- xref:upgrading-using-the-installation-utility-to-upgrade[Using the quick installer]
- xref:running-the-upgrade-playbook-directly[Running the upgrade playbook directly]

Choose and follow one of these methods.

[[upgrading-using-the-installation-utility-to-upgrade]]
== Using the Quick Installer to Upgrade

If you installed {product-title} using the
xref:../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[quick installation] method,
you should have an installation configuration file located at
*_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_*. The quick installer requires this file to
start an upgrade.

The quick installer supports upgrading between minor versions of {product-title}
(one minor version at a time, e.g., 3.5 to 3.6) as well as between
asynchronous errata updates within a minor version (e.g., 3.6.z).

If you have an older format installation configuration file in
*_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* from an installation of a previous
cluster version, the quick installer will attempt to upgrade the file to the new supported
format. If you do not have an installation configuration file of any format, you
can
xref:../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#defining-an-installation-configuration-file[create one manually].

To start an upgrade with the quick installer:

. Satisfy the steps in xref:preparing-for-an-automated-upgrade[Preparing for an Automated Upgrade] to ensure you are using the latest upgrade playbooks.

. Run the quick installer with the `upgrade` subcommand:
+
----
# atomic-openshift-installer upgrade
----
. Then, follow the on-screen instructions to upgrade to the latest release.

include::upgrading/automated_upgrades.adoc[tag=automated_upgrade_after_reboot]

[[running-the-upgrade-playbook-directly]]
== Running Upgrade Playbooks Directly

You can run automated upgrade playbooks using Ansible directly, similar to the
advanced installation method, if you have an inventory file. Playbooks can be
run using the `ansible-playbook` command.

The same *_v3_7_* upgrade playbooks can be used for either of the following
scenarios:

- Upgrading existing {product-title} 3.6 clusters to 3.7
- Upgrading existing {product-title} 3.7 clusters to the latest
xref:../release_notes/ocp_3_7_release_notes.adoc#ocp-37-asynchronous-errata-updates[asynchronous
errata updates]

[[upgrading-control-plane-nodes-separate-phases]]
=== Upgrading the Control Plane and Nodes in Separate Phases

An {product-title} cluster can be upgraded in one or more phases. You can choose
whether to upgrade all hosts in one phase by running a single Ansible playbook,
or upgrade the _control plane_ (master components) and nodes in multiple phases
using separate playbooks.

[NOTE]
====
Instructions on the full upgrade process and when to call these playbooks are
described in xref:upgrading-to-ocp-3-7[Upgrading to the Latest {product-title}
3.7 Release].
====

When upgrading in separate phases, the control plane phase includes upgrading:

- master components
- node services running on masters
- Docker running on masters
- Docker running on any stand-alone etcd hosts

When upgrading only the nodes, the control plane must already be upgraded. The
node phase includes upgrading:

- node services running on stand-alone nodes
- Docker running on stand-alone nodes

[NOTE]
====
Nodes running master components are not included during the node upgrade phase,
even though they have node services and Docker running on them. Instead, they
are upgraded as part of the control plane upgrade phase. This ensures node
services and Docker on masters are not upgraded twice (once during the control
plane phase and again during the node phase).
====

[[customizing-node-upgrades]]
=== Customizing Node Upgrades

Whether upgrading in a single or multiple phases, you can customize how the node
portion of the upgrade progresses by passing certain Ansible variables to an
upgrade playbook using the `-e` option.

[NOTE]
====
Instructions on the full upgrade process and when to call these playbooks are
described in xref:upgrading-to-ocp-3-7[Upgrading to the Latest {product-title}
3.7 Release].
====

The `openshift_upgrade_nodes_serial` variable can be set to an integer or
percentage to control how many node hosts are upgraded at the same time. The
default is `1`, upgrading nodes one at a time.

For example, to upgrade 20 percent of the total number of detected nodes at a
time:

----
$ ansible-playbook -i <path/to/inventory/file> \
    </path/to/upgrade/playbook> \
    -e openshift_upgrade_nodes_serial="20%"
----

The `openshift_upgrade_nodes_label` variable allows you to specify that only
nodes with a certain label are upgraded. This can also be combined with the
`openshift_upgrade_nodes_serial` variable.

For example, to only upgrade nodes in the *group1* region, two at a time:

----
$ ansible-playbook -i <path/to/inventory/file> \
    </path/to/upgrade/playbook> \
    -e openshift_upgrade_nodes_serial="2" \
    -e openshift_upgrade_nodes_label="region=group1"
----

See xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#updating-labels-on-nodes[Managing Nodes] for more on node labels.


[[upgrade-hooks]]
=== Customizing Upgrades With Ansible Hooks

When upgrading {product-title}, you can execute custom tasks during specific
operations through a system called _hooks_. Hooks allow cluster administrators
to provide files defining tasks to execute before and/or after specific areas
during installations and upgrades. This can be very helpful to validate or
modify custom infrastructure when installing or upgrading {product-title}.

It is important to remember that when a hook fails, the operation fails. This
means a good hook can run multiple times and provide the same results. A great
hook is idempotent.

[[upgrade-hooks-limitations]]
==== Limitations

- Hooks have no defined or versioned interface. They can use internal
*openshift-ansible* variables, but there is no guarantee these will remain in
future releases. In the future, hooks might be versioned, giving you advance
warning that your hook needs to be updated to work with the latest
*openshift-ansible*.
- Hooks have no error handling, so an error in a hook will halt the upgrade
process. The problem will need to be addressed and the upgrade re-run.

[[upgrade-hooks-using-hooks]]
==== Using Hooks

Hooks are defined in the *_hosts_* inventory file under the `OSEv3:vars`
section.

Each hook must point to a YAML file which defines Ansible tasks. This file will
be used as an _include_, meaning that the file cannot be a playbook, but a set
of tasks. Best practice suggests using absolute paths to the hook file to avoid
any ambiguity.

.Example Hook Definitions in an Inventory File
[source]
----
[OSEv3:vars]
openshift_master_upgrade_pre_hook=/usr/share/custom/pre_master.yml
openshift_master_upgrade_hook=/usr/share/custom/master.yml
openshift_master_upgrade_post_hook=/usr/share/custom/post_master.yml
----

.Example *_pre_master.yml_* Task
[source.yaml]
----
---
# Trivial example forcing an operator to ack the start of an upgrade
# file=/usr/share/custom/pre_master.yml

- name: note the start of a master upgrade
  debug:
      msg: "Master upgrade of {{ inventory_hostname }} is about to start"

- name: require an operator agree to start an upgrade
  pause:
      prompt: "Hit enter to start the master upgrade"
----

[[upgrade-hooks-available-hooks]]
==== Available Upgrade Hooks

`openshift_master_upgrade_pre_hook`::
- Runs _before_ each master is upgraded.
- This hook runs against _each master_ in serial.
- If a task must run against a different host, said task must use
link:http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_delegation.html#delegation[`delegate_to`
or `local_action`].

`openshift_master_upgrade_hook`::
- Runs _after_ each master is upgraded, but _before_ its service or system restart.
- This hook runs against **each master** in serial.
- If a task must run against a different host, said task must use
link:http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_delegation.html#delegation[`delegate_to`
or `local_action`].

`openshift_master_upgrade_post_hook`::
- Runs _after_ each master is upgraded and has had its service or system restart.
- This hook runs against _each master_ in serial.
- If a task must run against a different host, said task must use
link:http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_delegation.html#delegation[`delegate_to`
or `local_action`].

[[upgrading-to-ocp-3-7]]
=== Upgrading to the Latest {product-title} 3.7 Release

To upgrade an existing {product-title} 3.6 or 3.7 cluster to the latest 3.7
release:

. Satisfy the steps in xref:preparing-for-an-automated-upgrade[Preparing for an
Automated Upgrade] to ensure you are using the latest upgrade playbooks.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the steps on etcd v2 to v3 migration are satisfied, which is a
special requirement for the {product-title} 3.6 to 3.7 upgrade.
====

. Ensure the `openshift_deployment_type` parameter (formerly called
`deployment_type`) in your inventory file is set to `openshift-enterprise`.

. If you have multiple masters configured and want to enable rolling, full system
restarts of the hosts, you can set the `openshift_rolling_restart_mode`
parameter in your inventory file to `system`. Otherwise, the default value
`services` performs rolling service restarts on HA masters, but does not reboot
the systems. See
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#configuring-cluster-variables[Configuring
Cluster Variables] for details.

. At this point, you can choose to run the upgrade in a single or multiple phases.
See xref:upgrading-control-plane-nodes-separate-phases[Upgrading the Control
Plane and Nodes in Separate Phases] for more details which components are
upgraded in each phase.
+
If your inventory file is located somewhere other than the default
*_/etc/ansible/hosts_*, add the `-i` flag to specify its location. If you
previously used the `atomic-openshift-installer` command to run your
installation, you can check *_~/.config/openshift/hosts_* for the last inventory
file that was used, if needed.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can add `--tags pre_upgrade` to the following `ansible-playbook` commands to
run the pre-upgrade checks for the playbook. This is a dry-run option that
preforms all pre-upgrade checks without actually upgrading any hosts, and
reports any problems found.
====
+
** *Option A)* Upgrade control plane and nodes in a single phase.
+
Run the *_upgrade.yml_* playbook to upgrade the cluster in a single phase using
one playbook; the control plane is still upgraded first, then nodes in-place:
+
----
# ansible-playbook -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_7/upgrade.yml
----
+
** *Option B)* Upgrade the control plane and nodes in separate phases.

.. To upgrade only the control plane, run the *_upgrade_control_plane.yaml_*
playbook:
+
----
# ansible-playbook -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_7/upgrade_control_plane.yml
----

.. To upgrade only the nodes, run the *_upgrade_nodes.yaml_* playbook:
+
----
# ansible-playbook -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_7/upgrade_nodes.yml \
    [-e <customized_node_upgrade_variables>] <1>
----
<1> See xref:customizing-node-upgrades[Customizing Node Upgrades] for any desired
`<customized_node_upgrade_variables>`.
+
If you are upgrading the nodes in groups as described in
xref:customizing-node-upgrades[Customizing Node Upgrades], continue invoking the
*_upgrade_nodes.yml_* playbook until all nodes have been successfully upgraded.
// tag::automated_upgrade_after_reboot[]

. After all master and node upgrades have completed, a recommendation will be
printed to reboot all hosts. After rebooting, if there are no additional
features enabled, you can xref:verifying-the-upgrade[verify the upgrade].
Otherwise, the next step depends on what additional features you have previously
enabled.

== Upgrading the Service Catalog

// tag::automated-service-catalog-upgrade-steps[]
Starting with {product-title} 3.7, the service catalog, OpenShift Ansible
broker, and template service broker are enabled and deployed by default for new
cluster installations. However, they are not deployed by default during the
upgrade from {product-title} 3.6 to 3.7, so you must run an individual component
playbook separate post-upgrade.

[NOTE]
====
Upgrading from the {product-title} 3.6 Technology Preview version of the service
catalog and service brokers is not supported.
====

To upgrade to these features:

. See the following three sections in the
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[Advanced Installation] topic and update your inventory file accordingly:

Ansible playbook. This is the playbook to use if you were deploying logging for
the first time on an existing cluster, but is also used to upgrade existing
logging deployments.

. If you have not already done so, see
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#aggregate-logging-ansible-variables[Specifying Logging Ansible Variables] in the
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#install-config-aggregate-logging[Aggregating Container Logs] topic and update your Ansible inventory file to at least set the
following required variable within the `[OSEv3:vars]` section:
+
----
[OSEv3:vars]

openshift_logging_install_logging=true <1>
openshift_logging_image_version=<tag> <2>
----
<1> Enables the ability to upgrade the logging stack.

Ansible playbook. This is the playbook to use if you were deploying metrics for
the first time on an existing cluster, but is also used to upgrade existing
metrics deployments.

. If you have not already done so, see
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-ansible-variables[Specifying Metrics Ansible Variables] in the

// end::automated-metrics-upgrade-steps[]

[[special-considerations-for-glusterfs]]
== Special Considerations When Using Containerized GlusterFS
When upgrading  {product-title}, you must upgrade the set of nodes where
GlusterFS pods are running.

Special consideration must be taken when upgrading these nodes, as `drain` and
`unschedule` will not terminate and evacuate the GlusterFS pods because they are
running as part of a daemonset.

There is also the potential for someone to run an upgrade on multiple nodes at
the same time, which would lead to data availability issues if more than one was
hosting GlusterFS pods.

Even if a serial upgrade is running, there is no guarantee sufficient time will
be given for GlusterFS to complete all of its healing operations before
GlusterFS on the next node is terminated. This might leave the cluster in a bad
or unknown state. Therefore, the following procedure is recommended.

. xref:upgrading-control-plane-nodes-separate-phases[Upgrade the control plane]
(the master nodes and etcd nodes).

. Upgrade standard `infra` nodes (router, registry, logging, and metrics).
+
[NOTE]
====
If any of the nodes in those groups are running GlusterFS, perform step 4 of
this procedure at the same time. GlusterFS nodes must be upgraded along with
other nodes in their class (`app` versus `infra`), one at a time.
====

. Upgrade standard nodes running application containers.
+
[NOTE]
====
If any of the nodes in those groups are running GlusterFS, perform step 4 of
this procedure at the same time. GlusterFS nodes must be upgraded along with
other nodes in their class (`app` versus `infra`), one at a time.
====

. Upgrade the {product-title} nodes running GlusterFS one at a time.

.. Run `oc get daemonset` to verify the label found under `NODE-SELECTOR`. The
default value is `storagenode=glusterfs`.

.. Remove the daemonset label from the node:
+
----
$ oc label node <node_name> <daemonset_label>-
----
+
This will cause the GlusterFS pod to terminate on that node.

.. Add an additional label (for example, `type=upgrade`) to the node you want to upgrade.

.. To run the upgrade playbook on the single node where you terminated GlusterFS,
use `-e openshift_upgrade_nodes_label="type=upgrade"`.

.. When the upgrade completes, relabel the node with the daemonset selector:
+
----
$ oc label node <node_name> <daemonset_label>
----

.. Wait for the GlusterFS pod to respawn and appear.

.. `oc rsh` into the pod and verify all volumes are healed:
+
----
$ oc rsh <GlusterFS_pod_name>
$ for vol in `gluster volume list`; do gluster volume heal $vol info; done
----
+
Ensure all of the volumes are healed and there are no outstanding tasks. The
`heal info` command lists all pending entries for a given volume's heal process.
A volume is considered healed when `Number of entries` for that volume is `0`.

.. Remove the upgrade label (for example, `type=upgrade`) and go to the next
GlusterFS node.

[[special-considerations-for-gcepd]]
== Special considerations when using gcePD
Because the default gcePD storage provider uses an RWO (Read-Write Only) access
mode, you cannot perform a rolling upgrade on the registry or scale the registry
to multiple pods. Therefore, when upgrading {product-title}, you must specify
the following environment variables in your Ansible inventory file:

----
[OSEv3:vars]

== Verifying the Upgrade

To verify the upgrade:

. Check that all nodes are marked as *Ready*:
+
----
# oc get nodes
NAME                        STATUS                     AGE
master.example.com          Ready,SchedulingDisabled   165d
node1.example.com           Ready                      165d
node2.example.com           Ready                      165d

. Verify that you are running the expected versions of the *docker-registry*
and *router* images, if deployed.

. If you upgraded from Origin 1.0 to Origin 1.1, verify in your old
*_/etc/sysconfig/openshift-master_* and *_/etc/sysconfig/openshift-node_* files
that any custom configuration is added to your new
*_/etc/sysconfig/origin-master_* and *_/etc/sysconfig/origin-node_* files.
