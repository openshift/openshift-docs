== Overview

If you installed using the
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installation]
and the inventory file that was used is available, you can use upgrade
playbooks to automate the OpenShift cluster upgrade process.

include::upgrading/index.adoc[tag=37to39skipping38upgrade]

[IMPORTANT]
====
As of {product-title} 3.9, the quick installation method is deprecated. In a
future release, it will be removed completely. In addition, using the quick
installer to upgrade from version 3.7 to 3.9 is not supported.
====

The automated 3.7 to 3.9 control plane upgrade performs the following steps for
you:

* A backup of all etcd data is taken for recovery purposes.
* The API and controllers are updated from 3.7 to 3.8.
* Internal data structures are updated to 3.8.
* A second backup of all etcd data is taken for recovery purposes.
* The API and controllers are updated from 3.8 to 3.9.
* Internal data structures are updated to 3.9.
* The default router, if one exists, is updated from 3.7 to 3.9.
* The default registry, if one exists, is updated from 3.7 to 3.9.
* The default image streams and InstantApp templates are updated.

The automated 3.7 to 3.9 node upgrade performs a rolling update of nodes, which:

* Marks a subset of nodes unschedulable and drains them of pods.
* Updates node components from 3.7 to 3.9 (including openvswitch and container
runtime).
* Returns those nodes to service.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Ensure that you have met all
xref:../install_config/install/prerequisites.adoc#install-config-install-prerequisites[prerequisites]
before proceeding with an upgrade. Failure to do so can result in a failed
upgrade.

* If you are using GlusterFS, see
xref:special-considerations-for-glusterfs[Special Considerations When Using
Containerized GlusterFS] before proceeding.

* If you are using GCE Persistent Disk (gcePD), see xref:special-considerations-for-gcepd[Special Considerations When Using
gcePD] before proceeding.

* The day before the upgrade, validate {product-title} storage migration to ensure
potential issues are resolved prior to the outage window:
+
----
$ oc adm migrate storage --include=* --loglevel=2 --confirm --config /etc/origin/master/admin.kubeconfig
----

====

Automated upgrade playbooks are run via Ansible directly using the
`ansible-playbook` command with an inventory file, similar to the advanced
installation method. The same *_v3_9_* upgrade playbooks can be used for either
of the following scenarios:

- Upgrading existing {product-title} 3.7 clusters to 3.9
- Upgrading existing {product-title} 3.9 clusters to the latest
xref:../release_notes/ocp_3_9_release_notes.adoc#ocp-39-asynchronous-errata-updates[asynchronous
errata updates]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Running Ansible playbooks with the `--tags` or `--check` options is not supported by Red Hat.
====

[[running-upgrade-playbooks]]
== Running Upgrade Playbooks

Ensure that you have the latest *openshift-ansible* code checked out:

----
# cd ~/openshift-ansible
# git pull https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible master
----

Then run one of the following upgrade playbooks utilizing the inventory file you
used during the advanced installation. If your inventory file is located
somewhere other than the default *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*, add the `-i` flag to
specify the location.

[[upgrading-to-openshift-origin-1-1]]
=== Upgrading to OpenShift Origin 1.1

To upgrade from OpenShift Origin 1.0 to 1.1, run the following playbook:

----
# ansible-playbook \
    -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_0_to_v3_1/upgrade.yml
----

[NOTE]
====
The *_v3_0_to_v3_1_* in the above path is a reference to the related OpenShift
Enterprise versions, however it is also the correct playbook to use when
upgrading from OpenShift Origin 1.0 to 1.1.
====

[[upgrading-to-openshift-origin-1-1-z-releases]]
=== Upgrading to OpenShift Origin 1.1.z Releases

To upgrade an existing OpenShift Origin 1.1 cluster to the latest 1.1.z release,
run the following playbook:

----
# ansible-playbook \
    -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_1_minor/upgrade.yml
----

[NOTE]
====
The *v3_1_minor* in the above path is a reference to the related OpenShift
Enterprise versions, however it is also the correct playbook to use when
upgrading from OpenShift Origin 1.1 to the latest 1.1.z release.
====

After rebooting, continue to xref:verifying-the-upgrade[Verifying the Upgrade].

[[preparing-for-an-automated-upgrade]]
== Preparing for an Automated Upgrade

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before upgrading xref:upgrading-to-ocp-3-9[Upgrading your cluster to
{product-title} 3.9], the cluster must be already upgraded to the
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/release_notes/ocp_3_7_release_notes.html#ocp-37-asynchronous-errata-updates[latest
asynchronous release of version 3.7]. If your cluster is at a version earlier
than 3.7, you must first upgrade incrementally (e.g., 3.5 to 3.6, then 3.6 to
3.7).
====

[NOTE]
====
Before attempting the upgrade, follow the guidance in
xref:../day_two_guide/environment_health_checks.adoc#day-two-environment-health-checks[Environment
health checks] to verify the cluster's health. This will confirm that nodes are
in the *Ready* state, running the expected starting version, and will ensure
that there are no diagnostic errors or warnings.
====

If you are completing a large-scale upgrade, which involves at least 10 worker
nodes and thousands of projects and pods, review
xref:special-considerations-for-large-scale-upgrades[Special considerations for
large-scale upgrades] to prevent upgrade failures.

To prepare for an automated upgrade:

. Pull the latest subscription data from RHSM:
+
----
# subscription-manager refresh
----

. If you are upgrading from {product-title} 3.7 to 3.9:

.. Manually disable the 3.7 repository and enable _both_ the 3.8 and 3.9
repositories on each master and node host. You must also enable the
*rhel-7-server-ansible-2.4-rpms* repository, which is a new requirement starting
with {product-title} 3.9:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --disable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.7-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.8-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.9-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ansible-2.4-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-fast-datapath-rpms"
# yum clean all
----

.. Remove the `openshift_schedulable` parameter and its value from the entry for
each master host in the Ansible inventory file.
+
During upgrade, if a value is not provided for the `openshift_schedulable`
parameter, it is set to *true*. If a value is provided for
`openshift_schedulable`, it is not changed.
+
In previous versions of {product-title}, master hosts were marked unschedulable
by default by the installer, meaning that no pods could be placed on the hosts.
Starting with {product-title} 3.9, however, masters must be marked schedulable.
+
During upgrade, masters are automatically
labeled with the `master` node role, and non-master, non-infrastructure nodes
are labeled with the `compute` node role.
+
See the {product-title} 3.9 Release Notes on the these notable technical changes
and ensure that you understand their impact on your cluster:
+
- xref:../release_notes/ocp_3_9_release_notes.adoc#ocp-39-schedulable-masters[Masters Marked as Schedulable Nodes by Default]
- xref:../release_notes/ocp_3_9_release_notes.adoc#ocp-39-default-node-selector[Default Node Selector Set By Default and Automatic Node Labeling]
endif::[]

.. You must disable swap memory in your cluster before upgrading to {product-title}
3.9, otherwise the upgrade will fail. Whether swap memory was enabled using
`openshift_disable_swap=false` in your Ansible inventory file or enabled
manually per host, see
xref:../admin_guide/overcommit.adoc#disabling-swap-memory[Disabling Swap Memory]
in the Cluster Administration guide to disable it on each host.

. For any upgrade path, always ensure that you have the latest version of the
*atomic-openshift-utils* package on each RHEL 7 system, which also updates the
*openshift-ansible-** packages:
+
----
# yum update atomic-openshift-utils
----

. If you have applied manual configuration changes to your master or node
configuration files since your last Ansible playbook run (whether that was
initial installation or your most recent cluster upgrade), and you have not yet
made the equivalent changes to your inventory file, review
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#configuring-ansible[Configuring
Ansible Inventory Files]. For any variables that are relevant to the manual
changes you made, apply the equivalent appropriate changes to your inventory
files before running the upgrade. Otherwise, your manual changes may be
overwritten by default values during the upgrade, which could cause pods to not
run properly or other cluster stability issues.
+
In particular, if you made any changes to `admissionConfig` settings in your
master configuration files, review the
`openshift_master_admission_plugin_config` variable in
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#configuring-ansible[Configuring
Ansible Inventory Files]. Failure to do so could cause pods to get stuck in
`Pending` state if you had `ClusterResourceOverride` settings manually
configured previously (as described in
xref:../admin_guide/overcommit.adoc#configuring-masters-for-overcommitment[Configuring Masters for Overcommitment]).

////
.. Related to the change that masters be marked schedulable, you must now also set
the `osm_default_node_selector` variable in the `[OSEv3:vars]` section of your
inventory file; the upgrade will abort if it is not set. For example:
+
----
osm_default_node_selector="apps"
----
+
This variable sets the node selector that projects will use by default when
placing pods.
////

////
((Steps removed per QE feedback))

. When installing or updating *atomic-openshift-utils*,
*_/usr/share/openshift/examples/_*  does not get updated with the latest
templates. To update these files:
+
----
# mkdir /usr/share/openshift/examples
# cp -R /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v3.7/* /usr/share/openshift/examples/
----

. To persist *_/usr/share/openshift/examples/_* on all masters:
+
----
# mkdir /usr/share/openshift/examples
# scp -R /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v3.7/* \
    user@masterx:/usr/share/openshift/examples
----

. You must be logged in as a cluster administrative user on the master host for
the upgrade to succeed:
+
----
$ oc login
----
////

After satisfying these steps, you can review the following sections for more
information on how the upgrade process works and make decisions on additional
upgrade customization options if you so choose. When you are prepared to run the
upgrade, you can continue to xref:upgrading-to-ocp-3-9[Upgrading to the Latest {product-title} 3.9 Release].

[[upgrading-control-plane-nodes-separate-phases]]
=== Upgrading the Control Plane and Nodes in Separate Phases

An {product-title} cluster can be upgraded in one or more phases. You can choose
whether to upgrade all hosts in one phase by running a single Ansible playbook,
or upgrade the _control plane_ (master components) and nodes in multiple phases
using separate playbooks.

Instructions on the full upgrade process and when to call these playbooks are
described in xref:upgrading-to-ocp-3-9[Upgrading to the Latest {product-title}
3.9 Release].

[NOTE]
====
If your {product-title} cluster uses GlusterFS pods, you must perform the upgrade in multiple phases.
See xref:special-considerations-for-glusterfs[Special Considerations When Using Containerized GlusterFS] for details on how to upgrade with GlusterFS.
====

When upgrading in separate phases, the control plane phase includes upgrading:

- master components
- node services running on masters
- Docker running on masters
- Docker running on any stand-alone etcd hosts

When upgrading only the nodes, the control plane must already be upgraded. The
node phase includes upgrading:

- node services running on stand-alone nodes
- Docker running on stand-alone nodes

[NOTE]
====
Nodes running master components are not included during the node upgrade phase,
even though they have node services and Docker running on them. Instead, they
are upgraded as part of the control plane upgrade phase. This ensures node
services and Docker on masters are not upgraded twice (once during the control
plane phase and again during the node phase).
====

[[customizing-node-upgrades]]
=== Customizing Node Upgrades

Whether upgrading in a single or multiple phases, you can customize how the node
portion of the upgrade progresses by passing certain Ansible variables to an
upgrade playbook using the `-e` option.

[NOTE]
====
Instructions on the full upgrade process and when to call these playbooks are
described in xref:upgrading-to-ocp-3-9[Upgrading to the Latest {product-title}
3.7 Release].
====

The `openshift_upgrade_nodes_serial` variable can be set to an integer or
percentage to control how many node hosts are upgraded at the same time. The
default is `1`, upgrading nodes one at a time.

For example, to upgrade 20 percent of the total number of detected nodes at a
time:

----
$ ansible-playbook -i <path/to/inventory/file> \
    </path/to/upgrade/playbook> \
    -e openshift_upgrade_nodes_serial="20%"
----

The `openshift_upgrade_nodes_label` variable allows you to specify that only
nodes with a certain label are upgraded. This can also be combined with the
`openshift_upgrade_nodes_serial` variable.

For example, to only upgrade nodes in the *group1* region, two at a time:

----
$ ansible-playbook -i <path/to/inventory/file> \
    </path/to/upgrade/playbook> \
    -e openshift_upgrade_nodes_serial="2" \
    -e openshift_upgrade_nodes_label="region=group1"
----

[NOTE]
====
See xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#updating-labels-on-nodes[Managing
Nodes] for more on node labels.
====

The `openshift_upgrade_nodes_max_fail_percentage` variable allows you to specify
how many nodes may fail in each batch. The percentage of failure must exceed
your value before the playbook aborts the upgrade.

The `openshift_upgrade_nodes_drain_timeout` variable allows you to specify the
length of time to wait before giving up.

In this example, 10 nodes are upgraded at a time, the upgrade will abort if more
than 20 percent of the nodes fail, and there is a 600-second wait to drain the
node:

----
$ ansible-playbook -i <path/to/inventory/file> \
    </path/to/upgrade/playbook> \
    -e openshift_upgrade_nodes_serial=10 \
    -e openshift_upgrade_nodes_max_fail_percentage=20 \
    -e openshift_upgrade_nodes_drain_timeout=600
----

[[upgrade-hooks]]
=== Customizing Upgrades With Ansible Hooks

When upgrading {product-title}, you can execute custom tasks during specific
operations through a system called _hooks_. Hooks allow cluster administrators
to provide files defining tasks to execute before and/or after specific areas
during upgrades. This can be very helpful to validate or modify custom
infrastructure when upgrading {product-title}.

It is important to remember that when a hook fails, the operation fails. This
means a good hook can run multiple times and provide the same results. A great
hook is idempotent.

[[upgrade-hooks-limitations]]
==== Limitations

- Hooks have no defined or versioned interface. They can use internal
*openshift-ansible* variables, but there is no guarantee these will remain in
future releases. In the future, hooks may be versioned, giving you advance
warning that your hook needs to be updated to work with the latest
*openshift-ansible*.
- Hooks have no error handling, so an error in a hook will halt the upgrade
process. The problem will need to be addressed and the upgrade re-run.

[[upgrade-hooks-using-hooks]]
==== Using Hooks

Hooks are defined in the *_hosts_* inventory file under the `OSEv3:vars`
section.

Each hook must point to a YAML file which defines Ansible tasks. This file will
be used as an _include_, meaning that the file cannot be a playbook, but a set
of tasks. Best practice suggests using absolute paths to the hook file to avoid
any ambiguity.

.Example Hook Definitions in an Inventory File
[source]
----
[OSEv3:vars]
openshift_master_upgrade_pre_hook=/usr/share/custom/pre_master.yml
openshift_master_upgrade_hook=/usr/share/custom/master.yml
openshift_master_upgrade_post_hook=/usr/share/custom/post_master.yml
----

.Example *_pre_master.yml_* Task
[source.yaml]
----
---
# Trivial example forcing an operator to ack the start of an upgrade
# file=/usr/share/custom/pre_master.yml

- name: note the start of a master upgrade
  debug:
      msg: "Master upgrade of {{ inventory_hostname }} is about to start"

- name: require an operator agree to start an upgrade
  pause:
      prompt: "Hit enter to start the master upgrade"
----

[[upgrade-hooks-available-hooks]]
==== Available Upgrade Hooks

`openshift_master_upgrade_pre_hook`::
- Runs _before_ each master is upgraded.
- This hook runs against _each master_ in serial.
- If a task must run against a different host, said task must use
link:http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_delegation.html#delegation[`delegate_to`
or `local_action`].

`openshift_master_upgrade_hook`::
- Runs _after_ each master is upgraded, but _before_ its service or system restart.
- This hook runs against **each master** in serial.
- If a task must run against a different host, said task must use
link:http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_delegation.html#delegation[`delegate_to`
or `local_action`].

`openshift_master_upgrade_post_hook`::
- Runs _after_ each master is upgraded and has had its service or system restart.
- This hook runs against _each master_ in serial.
- If a task must run against a different host, said task must use
link:http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_delegation.html#delegation[`delegate_to`
or `local_action`].

[[upgrading-to-ocp-3-9]]
== Upgrading to the Latest {product-title} 3.9 Release

To upgrade an existing {product-title} 3.7 or 3.9 cluster to the latest 3.9
release:

. Satisfy the steps in xref:preparing-for-an-automated-upgrade[Preparing for an
Automated Upgrade] to ensure you are using the latest upgrade playbooks.

. Ensure the `openshift_deployment_type` parameter in your inventory file is set
to `openshift-enterprise`.

. Starting with {product-title} 3.9, the {product-title} web console is deployed
as a pod on masters during upgrade, and the `openshift_web_console_prefix` is
introduced to deploy the web console with a customized image prefix. The
`template_service_broker_prefix` is updated to match other components. If you
use a customized *docker-registry* for your installation instead of
*_registry.access.redhat.com_*, you must explicitly specify
`openshift_web_console_prefix` and `template_service_broker_prefix` to point to
the correct image prefix during upgrade:
+
----
openshift_web_console_prefix=<registry_ip>:<port>/openshift3/ose-
template_service_broker_prefix=<registry_ip>:<port>/openshift3/ose-
----

. If you want to enable rolling, full system
restarts of the hosts, you can set the `openshift_rolling_restart_mode`
parameter in your inventory file to `system`. Otherwise, the default value
`services` performs rolling service restarts on HA masters, but does not reboot
the systems. See
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#configuring-cluster-variables[Configuring
Cluster Variables] for details.

. At this point, you can choose to run the upgrade in a single or multiple phases.
See xref:upgrading-control-plane-nodes-separate-phases[Upgrading the Control
Plane and Nodes in Separate Phases] for more details which components are
upgraded in each phase.
+
If your inventory file is located somewhere other than the default
*_/etc/ansible/hosts_*, add the `-i` flag to specify its location. If you
previously used the `atomic-openshift-installer` command to run your
installation, you can check *_~/.config/openshift/hosts_* for the last inventory
file that was used, if needed.
+
** *Option A)* Upgrade control plane and nodes in a single phase.
+
Run the *_upgrade.yml_* playbook to upgrade the cluster in a single phase using
one playbook; the control plane is still upgraded first, then nodes in-place:
+
----
# ansible-playbook -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_9/upgrade.yml
----
+
** *Option B)* Upgrade the control plane and nodes in separate phases.

.. To upgrade only the control plane, run the *_upgrade_control_plane.yaml_*
playbook:
+
----
# ansible-playbook -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_9/upgrade_control_plane.yml
----

.. To upgrade only the nodes, run the *_upgrade_nodes.yaml_* playbook:
+
----
# ansible-playbook -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_9/upgrade_nodes.yml \
    [-e <customized_node_upgrade_variables>] <1>
----
<1> See xref:customizing-node-upgrades[Customizing Node Upgrades] for any desired
`<customized_node_upgrade_variables>`.
+
If you are upgrading the nodes in groups as described in
xref:customizing-node-upgrades[Customizing Node Upgrades], continue invoking the
*_upgrade_nodes.yml_* playbook until all nodes have been successfully upgraded.
// tag::automated_upgrade_after_reboot[]

. After all master and node upgrades have completed, reboot all hosts. After
rebooting, if there are no additional features enabled, you can
xref:verifying-the-upgrade[verify the upgrade]. Otherwise, the next step depends
on what additional features you have previously enabled.

. If you have any Elasticsearch SearchGuard indices in the following naming format, you need to delete and reseed the indices because the naming format has changed.
Elastic search might not work as expected unless you update the indices:
+
----
.searchguard.logging-es-*
----
+
.. Run the following command to delete the SearchGuard indices:
+
----
# oc exec -c elasticsearch <pod> -- es_util --query=.searchguard* -XDELETE
----
+
.. Run the following command to reseed the SearchGuard indices:
+
----
# for pod in $(oc get pods -l component=es -o jsonpath={.items[*].metadata.name}); do oc exec -c elasticsearch $pod -- es_seed_acl; done
----

. If you have not already done so, see
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#aggregate-logging-ansible-variables[Specifying Logging Ansible Variables] in the
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#install-config-aggregate-logging[Aggregating Container Logs] topic and update your Ansible inventory file to at least set the
following required variable within the `[OSEv3:vars]` section:
+
----
[OSEv3:vars]

openshift_logging_install_logging=true <1>
openshift_logging_image_version=<tag> <2>
----
<1> Enables the ability to upgrade the logging stack.
<2> Replace `<tag>` with `{latest-int-tag}` for the latest version.

. Add any other `openshift_logging_*` variables that you want to specify to
override the defaults, as described in
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#aggregate-logging-ansible-variables[Specifying Logging Ansible Variables].

. When you have finished updating your inventory file, follow the instructions in
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#deploying-the-efk-stack[Deploying

already set with:
----
        image: <image_name>:<vX.Y>
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
----

The latest version <image_name> might not be pulled if there is already one with
the same <image_name:vX.Y> stored locally on the node where the pod is being
re-deployed. If so, manually change the DeploymentConfig and DaemonSet to
`imagePullPolicy: Always` to make sure it is re-pulled.

[[special-considerations-for-large-scale-upgrades]]
== Special Considerations for Large-scale Upgrades

For large-scale cluster upgrades, which involve at least 10 worker nodes and
thousands of projects and pods, the API object storage migration should be
performed prior to running the upgrade playbooks, and then again after the
upgrade has successfully completed. Otherwise, the upgrade process will fail.

Refer to the *Running the pre- and post- API server model object migration
outside of the upgrade window* section of the
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/3208381[Recommendations for large-scale
OpenShift upgrades] for further guidance.

[[special-considerations-for-mixed-environments]]
== Special Considerations for Mixed Environments

Before you upgrade a mixed environment, such as one with Red Hat Enterprise
Linux (RHEL) and RHEL Atomic Host, set values in the inventory file
for both the `openshift_pkg_version` and `openshift_image_tag` parameters.
Setting these values ensures that all nodes in your cluster run the same
version of {product-title}.

For example, to upgrade from {product-title}
3.7 to {product-title} 3.9, set the following parameters and values:

----
openshift_pkg_version=-3.9.74
openshift_image_tag=v3.9.74
----

[NOTE]
====
These parameters can also be present in other, non-mixed, environments.

[[special-considerations-for-glusterfs]]
== Special Considerations When Using Containerized GlusterFS
When upgrading  {product-title}, you must upgrade the set of nodes where
GlusterFS pods are running.

Use care when upgrading these nodes, as `drain` and
`unschedule` will not terminate and evacuate the GlusterFS pods because they are
running as part of a daemonset.

There is also the potential for someone to run an upgrade on multiple nodes at
the same time. If this occurs, it would lead to data availability issues if more
than one node was hosting GlusterFS pods.

Even if a serial upgrade is running, there is no guarantee sufficient time will
be given for GlusterFS to complete all of its healing operations before
GlusterFS on the next node is terminated. This could leave the cluster in a bad
or unknown state. Therefore, the following procedure is recommended.

. xref:upgrading-control-plane-nodes-separate-phases[Upgrade the control plane]
(the master nodes and etcd nodes).

. Upgrade standard `infra` nodes (router, registry, logging, and metrics).
+
[NOTE]
====
If any of the nodes in those groups are running GlusterFS, perform step 4 of
this procedure at the same time. GlusterFS nodes must be upgraded along with
other nodes in their class (`app` versus `infra`), one at a time.
====

. Upgrade standard nodes running application containers.
+
[NOTE]
====
If any of the nodes in those groups are running GlusterFS, perform step 4 of
this procedure at the same time. GlusterFS nodes must be upgraded along with
other nodes in their class (`app` versus `infra`), one at a time.
====

. Upgrade the {product-title} nodes running GlusterFS one at a time.

.. Run `oc get daemonset` to verify the label found under `NODE-SELECTOR`. The
default value is `storagenode=glusterfs`.

.. Add a label (for example, `type=upgrade`) to the node you want to upgrade.

.. Using the *_upgrade_nodes.yml_* playbook on the node where you
terminated GlusterFS, run `-e openshift_upgrade_nodes_label="type=upgrade"`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The *_upgrade_nodes.yml_* playbook is located here:
----
# ansible-playbook -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_9/upgrade_nodes.yml \
    [-e <customized_node_upgrade_variables>] <1>
----
<1> See xref:customizing-node-upgrades[Customizing Node Upgrades] for any desired
`<customized_node_upgrade_variables>`.
====

.. Wait for the GlusterFS pod to respawn and appear.

.. `oc rsh` into the pod and verify all volumes are healed:
+
----
$ oc rsh <GlusterFS_pod_name>
$ for vol in `gluster volume list`; do gluster volume heal $vol info; done
----
+
Ensure all of the volumes are healed and there are no outstanding tasks. The
`heal info` command lists all pending entries for a given volume's heal process.
A volume is considered healed when `Number of entries` for that volume is `0`.

.. Remove the upgrade label and go to the next GlusterFS node:
+
----
$ oc label node <node_name> type-
----

[[special-considerations-for-gcepd]]
== Special considerations when using gcePD
Because the default gcePD storage provider uses an RWO (Read-Write Only) access
mode, you cannot perform a rolling upgrade on the registry or scale the registry
to multiple pods. Therefore, when upgrading {product-title}, you must specify
the following environment variables in your Ansible inventory file:

----
[OSEv3:vars]

openshift_hosted_registry_storage_provider=gcs
openshift_hosted_registry_storage_gcs_bucket=bucket01
openshift_hosted_registry_storage_gcs_keyfile=test.key
openshift_hosted_registry_storage_gcs_rootdirectory=/registry
----

[[verifying-the-upgrade]]
== Verifying the Upgrade

Ensure that the:

* cluster is healthy,
* services (master, node, and etcd) are running well,
* the {product-title}, `docker-registry`, and router versions are correct,
* the original applications are still available and the new application can be created, and
* running `oc adm diagnostics` produces no errors.

To verify the upgrade:

. Check that all nodes are marked as *Ready*:
+
----
# oc get nodes
NAME                   STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
master.example.com     Ready     master    7h        v1.9.1+a0ce1bc657
node1.example.com      Ready     compute   7h        v1.9.1+a0ce1bc657
node2.example.com      Ready     compute   7h        v1.9.1+a0ce1bc657
----

. Verify that you are running the expected versions of the *docker-registry*
and *router* images, if deployed.

that any custom configuration is added to your new
*_/etc/sysconfig/origin-master_* and *_/etc/sysconfig/origin-node_* files.
