[[about-this-upgrade]]
== About This Upgrade

If you installed using the standard
xref:../install/index.adoc#instal-planning[cluster installation] process, and
the inventory file that was used is available, you can use upgrade playbooks to
automate the OpenShift cluster upgrade process.

{product-title} 3.10 involves significant changes to the architecture of the
cluster, which are discussed further in the
xref:../release_notes/ocp_3_10_release_notes.adoc#ocp-310-notable-technical-changes[{product-title} 3.10 Release Notes].
The following sections detail how these notable technical changes affect the
upgrade process from {product-title} 3.9.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Running Ansible playbooks with the `--tags` or `--check` options is not supported by Red Hat.
====

[[upgrades-defining-node-group-and-host-mappings]]
=== Defining Node Groups and Host Mappings

Starting in {product-title} 3.10, node configurations are now
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#node-bootstrapping[bootstrapped]
from the master. When node services are started, the node checks if
a *_kubeconfig_* and other node configuration files exist before joining the
cluster. If they do not, the node pulls the configuration from the master, then
joins the cluster.

This process replaces administrators having to manually maintain the node
configuration uniquely on each node host. Instead, the contents of a node host's
*_/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml_* file are now provided by ConfigMaps
sourced from the master.

To map which ConfigMap to use for which node host, _node groups_ must be defined
and then set for each host in the inventory file. These procedures are handled
during the xref:preparing-for-an-automated-upgrade[Preparing for an Automated
Upgrade] section.

[[upgrades-updating-host-name-parameters]]
=== Updating Host Name Parameters

In {product-title} version  3.10, the `openshift_hostname` parameter was removed.
If you used the `openshift_hostname` parameter in your inventory file in
{product-title} version 3.9, you must remove that parameter from your inventory
file. Before you upgrade, you must set the `openshift_kubelet_name_override`
parameter to the `openshift_hostname` that you used in previous versions.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must not remove the `openshift_kubelet_name_override` parameter from your
inventory file after you upgrade.
====


[discrete]
[[upgrades-node-group-configmaps]]
===== Node ConfigMaps

The Configmaps for defining the node configurations must be available in the
*openshift-node* project. ConfigMaps are also now the authoritative definition
for node labels; the old `openshift_node_labels` value is effectively ignored.

The installer provides a playbook for creating the following default ConfigMaps:

- `node-config-master`
- `node-config-infra`
- `node-config-compute`

The following ConfigMaps are also created, which label nodes into multiple roles:

- `node-config-all-in-one`
- `node-config-master-infra`

[IMPORTANT]
====
Changes should not be made to a node host's
*_/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml_* file. They will be overwritten by the
configuration defined in the ConfigMap used by the node.
====

[discrete]
[[upgrades-node-group-definitions]]
===== Node Group Definitions

After updating the *openshift-ansible* package, you can view what the default
set of node group definitions looks like in YAML format in the
*_{pb-prefix}roles/openshift_facts/defaults/main.yml_* file:

----
openshift_node_groups:
  - name: node-config-master <1>
    labels:
      - 'node-role.kubernetes.io/master=true' <2>
    edits: [] <3>
  - name: node-config-infra
    labels:
      - 'node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=true'
    edits: []
  - name: node-config-compute
    labels:
      - 'node-role.kubernetes.io/compute=true'
    edits: []
  - name: node-config-master-infra
    labels:
      - 'node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=true,node-role.kubernetes.io/master=true'
    edits: []
  - name: node-config-all-in-one
    labels:
      - 'node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=true,node-role.kubernetes.io/master=true,node-role.kubernetes.io/compute=true'
    edits: []
----
<1> Node group name.
<2> List of node labels associated with the node group.
<3> Any edits to the node group's configuration.

If you do not set the `openshift_node_groups` variable in your inventory file's
`[OSEv3:vars]` group, the defaults defined above will be used. However, if you
want to deviate from these defaults, you must define the entire
`openshift_node_groups` structure (including all desired node groups) in your
inventory file.

The `openshift_node_groups` value is not merged with the defaults, and the YAML
definition must first be translated into a Python dictionary. You can then use
the `edits` field to modify any node configuration variables as desired by
specifying the key-value pairs.

[NOTE]
====
See
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#node-configuration-files[Master
and Node Configuration Files] for reference on configurable node variables.
====

For example, the following entry in an inventory file defines groups named
`node-config-master`, `node-config-infra`, and `node-config-compute`, and edits
the ConfigMap for `node-config-compute` to set `kubeletArguments.pods-per-core`
to `20`:

----
openshift_node_groups=[{'name': 'node-config-master', 'labels': ['node-role.kubernetes.io/master=true']}, {'name': 'node-config-infra', 'labels': ['node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=true',]}, {'name': 'node-config-compute', 'labels': ['node-role.kubernetes.io/compute=true'], 'edits': [{ 'key': 'kubeletArguments.pods-per-core','value': ['20']}]}]
----

Whenever the *_openshift_node_group.yml_* playbook is run, the changes defined
in the `edits` field will update the related ConfigMap (`node-config-compute` in
this example), which will ultimately affect the node's configuration file on the
host.

[[upgrade-workflow]]
=== Upgrade Workflow

The 3.9 to 3.10 control plane upgrade performs the following steps for
you:

* A backup of all etcd data is taken for recovery purposes.
* The API and controllers are updated from 3.9 to 3.10.
* Internal data structures are updated to 3.10.
* The default router, if one exists, is updated from 3.9 to 3.10.
* The default registry, if one exists, is updated from 3.9 to 3.10.
* The default image streams and InstantApp templates are updated.

The 3.9 to 3.10 node upgrade performs a rolling update of nodes, which:

* Marks a subset of nodes unschedulable and drains them of pods.
* Updates node components from 3.9 to 3.10.
* Converts from local configuration to bootstrapped TLS and Config.
* Converts SDN components from *systemd* services to DaemonSets.
* Returns those nodes to service.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Ensure that you have met all
xref:../install/prerequisites.adoc#install-config-install-prerequisites[prerequisites]
before proceeding with an upgrade. Failure to do so can result in a failed
upgrade.

* If you are using GlusterFS, see
xref:special-considerations-for-glusterfs[Special Considerations When Using
Containerized GlusterFS] before proceeding.

* If you are using GCE Persistent Disk (gcePD), see xref:special-considerations-for-gcepd[Special Considerations When Using
gcePD] before proceeding.

* The day before the upgrade, validate {product-title} storage migration to ensure
potential issues are resolved prior to the outage window:
+
----
$ oc adm migrate storage --include=* --loglevel=2 --confirm --config /etc/origin/master/admin.kubeconfig
----

====

Automated upgrade playbooks are run via Ansible directly using the
`ansible-playbook` command with an inventory file, similar to the advanced
installation method. The same *_v3_10_* upgrade playbooks can be used for either
of the following scenarios:

- Upgrading existing {product-title} 3.9 clusters to 3.10
- Upgrading existing {product-title} 3.10 clusters to the latest
xref:../release_notes/ocp_3_10_release_notes.adoc#ocp-310-asynchronous-errata-updates[asynchronous
errata updates]

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[[running-upgrade-playbooks]]
== Running Upgrade Playbooks

Ensure that you have the latest *openshift-ansible* code checked out:

----
# cd ~/openshift-ansible
# git pull https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible master
----

Then run one of the following upgrade playbooks utilizing the inventory file you
used during cluster installation. If your inventory file is located
somewhere other than the default *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*, add the `-i` flag to
specify the location.

[[upgrading-to-openshift-origin-minor]]
=== Upgrading OpenShift Origin Minor Versions

To upgrade to a new OpenShift Origin minor version run the following playbook:

----
# ansible-playbook \
    -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/<version>/upgrade.yml
----

[[upgrading-to-openshift-origin-z-stream]]
=== Upgrading to OpenShift Origin z-Stream Releases

To upgrade an existing OpenShift Origin latest z-stream of a minor release
(e.g., 3.10.z), run the following playbook:

----
# ansible-playbook \
    -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/<version>/upgrade.yml
----

After rebooting, continue to xref:verifying-the-upgrade[Verifying the Upgrade].

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[[preparing-for-an-automated-upgrade]]
== Preparing for an Automated Upgrade

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before upgrading your cluster to {product-title} 3.10, the cluster must be
already upgraded to the
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.9/release_notes/ocp_3_9_release_notes.html#ocp-37-asynchronous-errata-updates[latest asynchronous release of version 3.9]. If your cluster is at a version earlier
than 3.9, you must first upgrade incrementally. For example, upgrade from 3.6 to
3.7, then 3.7 to 3.9 (the 3.8 version was link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.9/release_notes/ocp_3_9_release_notes.html#ocp-39-about-this-release[skipped]).
====

[NOTE]
====
Before attempting the upgrade, follow the guidance in
xref:../day_two_guide/environment_health_checks.adoc#day-two-environment-health-checks[Environment
health checks] to verify the cluster's health. This will confirm that nodes are
in the *Ready* state, running the expected starting version, and will ensure
that there are no diagnostic errors or warnings.
====

If you are completing a large-scale upgrade, which involves at least 10 worker
nodes and thousands of projects and pods, review
xref:special-considerations-for-large-scale-upgrades[Special considerations for
large-scale upgrades] to prevent upgrade failures.

To prepare for an automated upgrade:

. Pull the latest subscription data from RHSM:
+
----
# subscription-manager refresh
----

. If you are upgrading from {product-title} 3.9 to 3.10:

.. Back up the following files that would be required should you later need to
downgrade back to {product-title} 3.9:

... On master hosts, back up the following files:
+
----
/usr/lib/systemd/system/atomic-openshift-master-api.service
/usr/lib/systemd/system/atomic-openshift-master-controllers.service
/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master-api
/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master-controllers
/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml
/etc/origin/master/scheduler.json
----
+
The *systemd* files are removed during the upgrade due to the changes to the
control plane static pod architecture.

... On node hosts (including masters, which have the node component on them), back
up the following files:
+
----
/usr/lib/systemd/system/atomic-openshift-*.service
/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml
----

... On etcd hosts (including masters that have etcd co-located on them), back up the
following files:
+
----
/etc/etcd/etcd.conf
----

.. The upgrade process will create a backup of all etcd data for recovery purposes,
but ensure that you have a recent etcd backup at
*_/backup/etcd-xxxxxx/backup.db_* before continuing. Manual etcd backup steps
are described in the
xref:../day_two_guide/environment_backup.adoc#etcd-backup_environment-backup[Day Two Operations Guide].
+
[NOTE]
====
When you upgrade {product-title}, your etcd configuration does not change.
Whether you run etcd as static pods on master hosts or as a separate service on
master hosts or separate hosts does not change after you upgrade.
====

.. Manually disable the 3.9 repository and enable the 3.10 repository on each
master and node host. You must also enable the *rhel-7-server-ansible-2.4-rpms*
repository, if it is not already:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --disable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.9-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.10-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ansible-2.4-rpms" \
# yum clean all
----

.. Ensure that you have the latest version of the *openshift-ansible* package on
the host you run the upgrade playbooks on:
+
----
# yum update -y openshift-ansible
----
+
[NOTE]
====
In previous {product-title} releases, the *atomic-openshift-utils* package was
installed for this step. However, starting with {product-title} 3.10, that
package is removed, and the *openshift-ansible* package provides all
requirements.
====
endif::[]

.. If you do not set the `openshift_node_groups` variable in the inventory file's
`[OSEv3:vars]` group, the default set of node groups and ConfigMaps will be
created when the *_openshift_node_group.yml_* playbook is run. If you want to
deviate from the defaults, define the entire node group set using a Python
dictionary format as outlined in
xref:upgrades-defining-node-group-and-host-mappings[Defining Node Groups and Host Mappings],
specifying their `name`, `labels`, and any `edits` to modify the ConfigMaps. For
example:
+
----
[OSEv3:vars]

openshift_node_groups=[{'name': 'node-config-master', 'labels': ['node-role.kubernetes.io/master=true']}, {'name': 'node-config-infra', 'labels': ['node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=true',]}, {'name': 'node-config-compute', 'labels': ['node-role.kubernetes.io/compute=true'], 'edits': [{ 'key': 'kubeletArguments.pods-per-core','value': ['20']}]}]
----

.. In order to convert a {product-title} 3.9 cluster to using the new node group
definitions and mappings, all hosts previously defined in the `[nodes]`
inventory group must be assigned an `openshift_node_group_name`. This value is
used to select the ConfigMap that configures each node.
+
For example:
+
----
[nodes]
master[1:3].example.com openshift_node_group_name='node-config-master'
infra-node1.example.com openshift_node_group_name='node-config-infra'
infra-node2.example.com openshift_node_group_name='node-config-infra'
node1.example.com openshift_node_group_name='node-config-compute'
node2.example.com openshift_node_group_name='node-config-compute'
----
+
In addition, remove the `openshift_node_labels` setting from any existing host
entries `[nodes]` group if they are set. Node labels should now be defined in
the ConfigMap associated with the host's `openshift_node_group_name` instead.

.. The upgrade process will be blocked until you have the newly required ConfigMaps
for bootstrapping nodes in the *openshift-node* project. Run the following
playbook to have the defaults created (or if you defined the
`openshift_node_groups` structure in the previous step, your custom sets will be
created):
+
[subs=attributes+]
----
# ansible-playbook -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    {pb-prefix}playbooks/openshift-master/openshift_node_group.yml
----

.. Carefully verify that each ConfigMap has created and defined as expected. Get
your list of all ConfigMaps in the *openshift-node* project:
+
----
$ oc get configmaps -n openshift-node
----
+
Then use `oc describe` to inspect them individually:
+
----
$ oc describe configmaps -n openshift-node <configmap_name>
----

. If you have applied manual configuration changes to your master or node
configuration files since your last Ansible playbook run (whether that was
initial installation or your most recent cluster upgrade), and you have not yet
made the equivalent changes to your inventory file, review
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-ansible[Configuring
Your Inventory File]. For any variables that are relevant to the manual
changes you made, apply the equivalent appropriate changes to your inventory
files before running the upgrade. Otherwise, your manual changes may be
overwritten by default values during the upgrade, which could cause pods to not
run properly or other cluster stability issues.
+
Additionally, verify the following settings:

.. If you made any changes to `admissionConfig` settings in your
master configuration files, review the
`openshift_master_admission_plugin_config` variable in
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-ansible[Configuring
Your Inventory File]. Failure to do so could cause pods to get stuck in
`Pending` state if you had `ClusterResourceOverride` settings manually
configured previously (as described in
xref:../admin_guide/overcommit.adoc#configuring-masters-for-overcommitment[Configuring Masters for Overcommitment]).

.. If you manually manage the cluster's *_/etc/origin/master/htpasswd_* file,
add `openshift_master_manage_htpasswd=false` to your inventory file to prevent
the upgrade process from overwriting the *_htpasswd_* file.

After satisfying these steps, you can review the following sections for more
information on how the upgrade process works and make decisions on additional
upgrade customization options if you so choose. When you are prepared to run the
upgrade, you can continue to xref:upgrading-to-ocp-3-10[Upgrading to the Latest {product-title} 3.10 Release].

[[updating-policy-definitions]]
=== Updating Policy Definitions

During a cluster upgrade, and on every restart of any master, the
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[default
cluster roles] are automatically reconciled to restore any missing permissions.

. If you customized default cluster roles and want to ensure a role reconciliation
does not modify them, protect each role from reconciliation:
+
----
$ oc annotate clusterrole.rbac <role_name> --overwrite rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate=false
----
+
[WARNING]
====
You must manually update the roles that contain this setting to include any new
or required permissions after upgrading.
====

. Generate a default bootstrap policy template file:
+
----
$ oc adm create-bootstrap-policy-file --filename=policy.json
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The contents of the file vary based on the {product-title} version, but the file
contains only the default policies.
====

. Update the *_policy.json_* file to include any cluster role customizations.

. Use the policy file to automatically reconcile roles and role bindings that
are not reconcile protected:
+
----
$ oc auth reconcile -f policy.json
----

. Reconcile security context constraints:
+
----
# oc adm policy reconcile-sccs \
    --additive-only=true \
    --confirm
----

[[upgrading-control-plane-nodes-separate-phases]]
=== Upgrading the Control Plane and Nodes in Separate Phases

An {product-title} cluster can be upgraded in one or more phases. You can choose
whether to upgrade all hosts in one phase by running a single Ansible playbook,
or upgrade the _control plane_ (master components) and nodes in multiple phases
using separate playbooks.

Instructions on the full upgrade process and when to call these playbooks are
described in xref:upgrading-to-ocp-3-10[Upgrading to the Latest {product-title}
3.10 Release].

[NOTE]
====
If your {product-title} cluster uses GlusterFS pods, you must perform the upgrade in multiple phases.
See xref:special-considerations-for-glusterfs[Special Considerations When Using Containerized GlusterFS] for details on how to upgrade with GlusterFS.
====

When upgrading in separate phases, the control plane phase includes upgrading:

- master components
- node services running on masters
- Docker or CRI-O running on masters
- Docker or CRI-O running on any stand-alone etcd hosts

When upgrading only the nodes, the control plane must already be upgraded. The
node phase includes upgrading:

- node services running on stand-alone nodes
- Docker or CRI-O running on stand-alone nodes

[NOTE]
====
Nodes running master components are not included during the node upgrade phase,
even though they have node services and Docker running on them. Instead, they
are upgraded as part of the control plane upgrade phase. This ensures node
services and Docker on masters are not upgraded twice (once during the control
plane phase and again during the node phase).
====

[[customizing-node-upgrades]]
=== Customizing Node Upgrades

Whether upgrading in a single or multiple phases, you can customize how the node
portion of the upgrade progresses by passing certain Ansible variables to an
upgrade playbook using the `-e` option.

[NOTE]
====
Instructions on the full upgrade process and when to call these playbooks are
described in xref:upgrading-to-ocp-3-10[Upgrading to the Latest {product-title}
3.10 Release].
====

The `openshift_upgrade_nodes_serial` variable can be set to an integer or
percentage to control how many node hosts are upgraded at the same time. The
default is `1`, upgrading nodes one at a time.

For example, to upgrade 20 percent of the total number of detected nodes at a
time:

----
$ ansible-playbook -i <path/to/inventory/file> \
    </path/to/upgrade/playbook> \
    -e openshift_upgrade_nodes_serial="20%"
----

The `openshift_upgrade_nodes_label` variable allows you to specify that only
nodes with a certain label are upgraded. This can also be combined with the
`openshift_upgrade_nodes_serial` variable.

For example, to only upgrade nodes in the *group1* region, two at a time:

----
$ ansible-playbook -i <path/to/inventory/file> \
    </path/to/upgrade/playbook> \
    -e openshift_upgrade_nodes_serial="2" \
    -e openshift_upgrade_nodes_label="region=group1"
----

[NOTE]
====
See xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#updating-labels-on-nodes[Managing
Nodes] for more on node labels.
====

The `openshift_upgrade_nodes_max_fail_percentage` variable allows you to specify
how many nodes may fail in each batch. The percentage of failure must exceed
your value before the playbook aborts the upgrade.

The `openshift_upgrade_nodes_drain_timeout` variable allows you to specify the
length of time to wait before giving up.

In this example, 10 nodes are upgraded at a time, the upgrade will abort if more
than 20 percent of the nodes fail, and there is a 600-second wait to drain the
node:

----
$ ansible-playbook -i <path/to/inventory/file> \
    </path/to/upgrade/playbook> \
    -e openshift_upgrade_nodes_serial=10 \
    -e openshift_upgrade_nodes_max_fail_percentage=20 \
    -e openshift_upgrade_nodes_drain_timeout=600
----

[[upgrade-hooks]]
=== Customizing Upgrades With Ansible Hooks

When upgrading {product-title}, you can execute custom tasks during specific
operations through a system called _hooks_. Hooks allow cluster administrators
to provide files defining tasks to execute before and/or after specific areas
during upgrades. This can be very helpful to validate or modify custom
infrastructure when upgrading {product-title}.

It is important to remember that when a hook fails, the operation fails. This
means a good hook can run multiple times and provide the same results. A great
hook is idempotent.

[[upgrade-hooks-limitations]]
==== Limitations

- Hooks have no defined or versioned interface. They can use internal
*openshift-ansible* variables, but there is no guarantee these will remain in
future releases. In the future, hooks may be versioned, giving you advance
warning that your hook needs to be updated to work with the latest
*openshift-ansible*.
- Hooks have no error handling, so an error in a hook will halt the upgrade
process. The problem will need to be addressed and the upgrade re-run.

[[upgrade-hooks-using-hooks]]
==== Using Hooks

Hooks are defined in the *_hosts_* inventory file under the `OSEv3:vars`
section.

Each hook must point to a YAML file which defines Ansible tasks. This file will
be used as an _include_, meaning that the file cannot be a playbook, but a set
of tasks. Best practice suggests using absolute paths to the hook file to avoid
any ambiguity.

.Example Hook Definitions in an Inventory File

[[upgrading-to-ocp-3-10]]
== Upgrading to the Latest {product-title} 3.10 Release

To upgrade an existing {product-title} 3.9 or 3.10 cluster to the latest 3.10
release:

. Satisfy the steps in xref:preparing-for-an-automated-upgrade[Preparing for an
Automated Upgrade] to ensure you are using the latest upgrade playbooks.

. Ensure the `openshift_deployment_type` parameter in your inventory file is set
to `openshift-enterprise`.

. If you want to enable rolling, full system
restarts of the hosts, you can set the `openshift_rolling_restart_mode`
parameter in your inventory file to `system`. Otherwise, the default value
`services` performs rolling service restarts on HA masters, but does not reboot
the systems. See
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-cluster-variables[Configuring
Cluster Variables] for details.

. At this point, you can choose to run the upgrade in a single or multiple phases.
See xref:upgrading-control-plane-nodes-separate-phases[Upgrading the Control
Plane and Nodes in Separate Phases] for more details which components are
upgraded in each phase.
+
If your inventory file is located somewhere other than the default
*_/etc/ansible/hosts_*, add the `-i` flag to specify its location. If you
previously used the `atomic-openshift-installer` command to run your
installation, you can check *_~/.config/openshift/hosts_* for the last inventory
file that was used, if needed.
+
** *Option A)* Upgrade control plane and nodes in a single phase.
+
Run the *_upgrade.yml_* playbook to upgrade the cluster in a single phase using
one playbook; the control plane is still upgraded first, then nodes in-place:
+
----
# ansible-playbook -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_10/upgrade.yml
----
+
** *Option B)* Upgrade the control plane and nodes in separate phases.

.. To upgrade only the control plane, run the *_upgrade_control_plane.yaml_*
playbook:
+
----
# ansible-playbook -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_10/upgrade_control_plane.yml
----

.. To upgrade only the nodes, run the *_upgrade_nodes.yaml_* playbook:
+
----
# ansible-playbook -i </path/to/inventory/file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_10/upgrade_nodes.yml \
    [-e <customized_node_upgrade_variables>] <1>
----
<1> See xref:customizing-node-upgrades[Customizing Node Upgrades] for any desired
`<customized_node_upgrade_variables>`.
+
If you are upgrading the nodes in groups as described in
xref:customizing-node-upgrades[Customizing Node Upgrades], continue invoking the
*_upgrade_nodes.yml_* playbook until all nodes have been successfully upgraded.
// tag::automated_upgrade_after_reboot[]

. After all master and node upgrades have completed, reboot all hosts. After
rebooting, if there are no additional features enabled, you can
xref:verifying-the-upgrade[verify the upgrade]. Otherwise, the next step depends
on what additional features you have previously enabled.

[[upgrading-efk-logging-stack]]
== Upgrading the EFK Logging Stack

To upgrade an existing EFK logging stack deployment, you must use the provided
*_/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-logging/config.yml_*
Ansible playbook. This is the playbook to use if you were deploying logging for
the first time on an existing cluster, but is also used to upgrade existing
logging deployments.

. If you have not already done so, see
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#aggregate-logging-ansible-variables[Specifying Logging Ansible Variables] in the
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#install-config-aggregate-logging[Aggregating Container Logs] topic and update your Ansible inventory file to at least set the
following required variable within the `[OSEv3:vars]` section:
+
----
[OSEv3:vars]

openshift_logging_install_logging=true <1>
----
<1> Enables the ability to upgrade the logging stack.

. Add any other `openshift_logging_*` variables that you want to specify to
override the defaults, as described in
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#aggregate-logging-ansible-variables[Specifying Logging Ansible Variables].

. When you have finished updating your inventory file, follow the instructions in
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#deploying-the-efk-stack[Deploying
the EFK Stack] to run the *_openshift-logging/config.yml_* playbook and complete
the logging deployment upgrade.

[NOTE]
====
If your Fluentd DeploymentConfig and DaemonSet for the EFK components are
already set with:

----
        image: <image_name>:<vX.Y>
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
----

The latest version `<image_name>` might not be pulled if there is already one with
the same `<image_name:vX.Y>` stored locally on the node where the pod is being
re-deployed. If so, manually change the DeploymentConfig and DaemonSet to
`imagePullPolicy: Always` to make sure it is re-pulled.
====

[[upgrading-cluster-metrics]]
== Upgrading Cluster Metrics

To upgrade an existing cluster metrics deployment, you must use the provided
*_/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-metrics/config.yml_*
Ansible playbook. This is the playbook to use if you were deploying metrics for
the first time on an existing cluster, but is also used to upgrade existing
metrics deployments.

. If you have not already done so, see
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-ansible-variables[Specifying
Metrics Ansible Variables] in the
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#install-config-cluster-metrics[Enabling
Cluster Metrics] topic and update your Ansible inventory file to at least set
the following required variables within the `[OSEv3:vars]` section:
+
----
[OSEv3:vars]

openshift_metrics_install_metrics=true <1>
openshift_metrics_hawkular_hostname=<fqdn> <2>
openshift_metrics_cassandra_storage_type=(emptydir|pv|dynamic) <3>
----
<1> Enables the ability to upgrade the metrics deployment.
<2> Used for the Hawkular Metrics route. Specify a fully qualified
domain name.
<3> Choose the same type as the previous deployment.

. Add any other `openshift_metrics_*` variables that you want to specify to
override the defaults, as described in
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-ansible-variables[Specifying
Metrics Ansible Variables].

. When you have finished updating your inventory file, follow the instructions
in
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#deploying-the-metrics-components[Deploying
the Metrics Deployment] to run the *_openshift-metrics/config.yml_* playbook and
complete the metrics deployment upgrade.

[[special-considerations-for-large-scale-upgrades]]
== Special Considerations for Large-scale Upgrades

For large-scale cluster upgrades, which involve at least 10 worker nodes and
thousands of projects and pods, the API object storage migration should be
performed prior to running the upgrade playbooks, and then again after the
upgrade has successfully completed. Otherwise, the upgrade process will fail.

Refer to the *Running the pre- and post- API server model object migration
outside of the upgrade window* section of the
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/3208381[Recommendations for large-scale
OpenShift upgrades] for further guidance.

[[special-considerations-for-mixed-environments]]
== Special Considerations for Mixed Environments

If your {product-title} cluster uses a mixed environment or gcePD storage,
you need to take more steps before you upgrade it.

Before you upgrade a mixed environment, such as one with Red Hat Enterprise
Linux (RHEL) and RHEL Atomic Host, set values in the inventory file for both the
`openshift_pkg_version` and `openshift_image_tag` parameters. Setting these
values ensures that all nodes in your cluster run the same version of
{product-title}. While this is a best practice for major updates, such as from
{product-title} 2 to {product-title} 3, setting these values are mandatory
for minor version upgrades.

For example, to upgrade from {product-title}
3.9 to {product-title} 3.10, set the following parameters and values:

----
openshift_pkg_version=-3.10.16
openshift_image_tag=v3.10.16
----

[NOTE]
====
These parameters can also be present in other, non-mixed, environments.
====

[[special-considerations-for-glusterfs]]
== Special Considerations When Using Containerized GlusterFS
When upgrading  {product-title}, you must upgrade the set of nodes where
GlusterFS pods are running.

Special consideration must be taken when upgrading these nodes, as `drain` and
`unschedule` will not terminate and evacuate the GlusterFS pods because they are
running as part of a daemonset.

There is also the potential for someone to run an upgrade on multiple nodes at
the same time, which would lead to data availability issues if more than one was
hosting GlusterFS pods.

Even if a serial upgrade is running, there is no guarantee sufficient time will
be given for GlusterFS to complete all of its healing operations before
GlusterFS on the next node is terminated. This could leave the cluster in a bad
or unknown state. Therefore, the following procedure is recommended.

. xref:upgrading-control-plane-nodes-separate-phases[Upgrade the control plane]
(the master nodes and etcd nodes).

. Upgrade standard `infra` nodes (router, registry, logging, and metrics).
+
[NOTE]
====
If any of the nodes in those groups are running GlusterFS, perform step 4 of
this procedure at the same time. GlusterFS nodes must be upgraded along with
other nodes in their class (`app` versus `infra`), one at a time.
====

. Upgrade standard nodes running application containers.
+
[NOTE]
====
If any of the nodes in those groups are running GlusterFS, perform step 4 of
this procedure at the same time. GlusterFS nodes must be upgraded along with
other nodes in their class (`app` versus `infra`), one at a time.
====

. Upgrade the {product-title} nodes running GlusterFS one at a time.

.. Add a label to the node you want to upgrade:
+
----
$ oc label node <node_name> type=upgrade
----

.. To run the upgrade playbook on a single node,
use `-e openshift_upgrade_nodes_label="type=upgrade"`.

.. Wait for the GlusterFS pod to respawn and appear.

.. `oc rsh` into the pod and verify all volumes are healed:
+
----
$ oc rsh <GlusterFS_pod_name>
$ for vol in `gluster volume list`; do gluster volume heal $vol info; done
----
+
Ensure all of the volumes are healed and there are no outstanding tasks. The
`heal info` command lists all pending entries for a given volume's heal process.
A volume is considered healed when `Number of entries` for that volume is `0`.

.. Remove the upgrade label and go to the next GlusterFS node.
+
----
$ oc label node <node_name> type-
----


[[special-considerations-for-gcepd]]
== Special Considerations When Using gcePD
Because the default gcePD storage provider uses an RWO (Read-Write Only) access
mode, you cannot perform a rolling upgrade on the registry or scale the registry
to multiple pods. Therefore, when upgrading {product-title}, you must specify
the following environment variables in your Ansible inventory file:

----
[OSEv3:vars]

openshift_hosted_registry_storage_provider=gcs
openshift_hosted_registry_storage_gcs_bucket=bucket01
openshift_hosted_registry_storage_gcs_keyfile=test.key
openshift_hosted_registry_storage_gcs_rootdirectory=/registry
----

[[verifying-the-upgrade]]
== Verifying the Upgrade

Ensure that the:

* cluster is healthy,
* master, node, and etcd services or static pods are running well,
* the {product-title}, `docker-registry`, and router versions are correct,
* the original applications are still available and the new application can be created, and
* running `oc adm diagnostics` produces no errors.

To verify the upgrade:

. Check that all nodes are marked as *Ready*:
+
----
# oc get nodes
NAME                     STATUS    ROLES        AGE       VERSION

. Verify the static pods for the control plane are running:
+
----
# oc get pods -n kube-system
NAME                                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
