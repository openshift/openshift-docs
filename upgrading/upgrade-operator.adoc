Upgrades through the {rh-rhacs-first} Operator are performed automatically or manually, depending on the *Update approval* option you chose at installation.

{product-title-short} 4.0 includes a significant architectural change, moving Central’s database to PostgreSQL. Because of this change, {product-title-short} 4.0 Operator is published by a new subscription channel. Therefore, as part of the upgrade instructions, you must manually change the subscription channel to upgrade from {product-title-short} 3.74 to {product-title-short} 4.0.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Because of the database related changes introduced in {product-title-short} 4.0, even if you have selected *Automatic* in the *Update approval* field, you must manually upgrade to {product-title-short} 4.0.
* You must be using {product-title-short} 3.74 to upgrade to {product-title-short} 4.0. If you are using a version older than 3.74, you must first upgrade to {product-title-short} 3.74 and then upgrade to {product-title-short} 4.0.
