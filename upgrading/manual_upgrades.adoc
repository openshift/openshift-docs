== Overview

[IMPORTANT]
====
As of {product-title} 3.9, manual upgrades are not supported. In a future
release, this process will be removed.
====

As an alternative to performing an
xref:../upgrading/automated_upgrades.adoc#install-config-upgrading-automated-upgrades[automated upgrade], you can manually upgrade your {product-title} cluster. To manually
upgrade without disruption, it is important to upgrade each component as
documented in this topic.

Before you begin your upgrade, familiarize yourself now with the entire
procedure. xref:additional-instructions-per-release[Specific releases may
require additional steps] to be performed at key points before or during the
standard upgrade process.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that you have met all
xref:../install_config/install/prerequisites.adoc#install-config-install-prerequisites[prerequisites]
before proceeding with an upgrade. Failure to do so can result in a failed
upgrade.

If you are using GlusterFS, see
xref:../upgrading/automated_upgrades.adoc#special-considerations-for-glusterfs[Special
Considerations When Using Containerized GlusterFS] before proceeding.

The day before the upgrade, validate {product-title} storage migration to ensure
potential issues are resolved prior to the outage window:

----
$ oc adm migrate storage --include=* --loglevel=2 --confirm --config /etc/origin/master/admin.kubeconfig
----

[[preparing-for-a-manual-upgrade]]
== Preparing for a Manual Upgrade

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[NOTE]
====
Before upgrading your cluster to {product-title} 3.9, the cluster must be
already upgraded to the
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/release_notes/ocp_3_7_release_notes.html#ocp-37-asynchronous-errata-updates[latest asynchronous release of version 3.7]. If your cluster is at a version earlier
than 3.7, you must first upgrade incrementally (e.g., 3.5 to 3.6, then 3.6 to
3.7).
====
endif::[]

To prepare for a manual upgrade, follow these steps:

. Follow the steps in xref:manual-upgrades-verifying-the-upgrade[Verifying the
Upgrade] to verify the cluster's health (if you are upgrading from 3.7 to 3.9,
check the command outputs for the relevant 3.7 version instead of the stated
3.9). This will confirm that nodes are in the *Ready* state, running the
expected starting version, and will ensure that there are no diagnostic errors
or warnings.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]

. Pull the latest subscription data from Red Hat Subscription Manager (RHSM):
+
----
# subscription-manager refresh
----
endif::[]

. If you are upgrading from {product-title} 3.7 to 3.9:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
.. Manually disable the 3.7 repository and enable both the 3.8 and 3.9 repositories
on each master and node host. You must also enable the
*rhel-7-server-ansible-2.4-rpms* repository, which is a new requirement starting
with {product-title} 3.9:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --disable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.7-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.8-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.9-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ansible-2.4-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-fast-datapath-rpms"
# yum clean all
----
endif::[]

.. You must disable swap memory in your cluster before upgrading to {product-title}
3.9, otherwise the upgrade will fail. Whether swap memory was enabled using
`openshift_disable_swap=false` in your Ansible inventory file or enabled
manually per host, see
xref:../admin_guide/overcommit.adoc#disabling-swap-memory[Disabling Swap Memory]
in the Cluster Administration guide to disable it on each host.

. Install or update to the latest available version of the
*atomic-openshift-utils* package on each RHEL 7 system, which provides files
that will be used in later sections:
+
----
# yum install atomic-openshift-utils
----

. Install or update to the following latest available **-excluder* packages on
each RHEL 7 system, which helps ensure your systems stay on the correct versions
of *atomic-openshift* and *docker* packages when you are not trying to upgrade,
according to the {product-title} version:
+
----
# yum install atomic-openshift-excluder atomic-openshift-docker-excluder
----
+
These packages add entries to the `exclude` directive in the host's
*_/etc/yum.conf_* file.

. xref:../day_two_guide/host_level_tasks.adoc#etcd-backup_deprecating-etcd[Create an *etcd* backup] on each etcd host.

. For any upgrade path, ensure that you are running the latest kernel on
each RHEL 7 system:
+
----
# yum update kernel
----

////
((Step removed per QE feedback))
. When installing or updating *atomic-openshift-utils*,
*_/usr/share/openshift/examples/_* does not get updated with the latest
templates. To update these files:
+
----
# mkdir /usr/share/openshift/examples
# cp -R /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v3.9/* /usr/share/openshift/examples/
----
////

[[upgrading-masters]]
== Upgrading Master Components

Before upgrading any stand-alone nodes, upgrade the master components (which
provide the _control plane_ for the cluster).

. Run the following command on each master to remove the *atomic-openshift*
packages from the list of yum excludes on the host:
+
----
# atomic-openshift-excluder unexclude
----

. Upgrade *etcd* on all master hosts and any external etcd hosts.

.. For RHEL 7 systems using the RPM-based method:

... Upgrade the *etcd* package:
+
----
# yum update etcd
----

... Restart the *etcd* service and review the logs to ensure it restarts
successfully:
+
----
# systemctl restart etcd
# journalctl -r -u etcd
----

.. For RHEL Atomic Host 7 systems and RHEL 7 systems using the containerized
method:

... Pull the latest *rhel7/etcd* image:
+
----
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7/etcd
----

... Restart the *etcd_container* service and review the logs to ensure it restarts
successfully:
+
----
# systemctl restart etcd_container
# journalctl -r -u etcd_container
----

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
. On each master host, upgrade the *origin-master* package:
+
----
# yum upgrade origin-master
----

. If you are upgrading from OpenShift Origin 1.0 to 1.1:

.. Create the following master proxy client certificates:
+
----
# cd /etc/origin/master/
# oc adm ca create-master-certs --cert-dir=/etc/origin/master/ \
            --master=https://<internal-master-fqdn>:8443 \
            --public-master=https://<external-master-fqdn>:8443 \
            --hostnames=<external-master-fqdn>,<internal-master-fqdn>,localhost,127.0.0.1,<master-ip-address>,kubernetes.default.local \
            --overwrite=false
----
+
This creates files at  *_/etc/origin/master/master.proxy-client.{crt,key}_*.
Then, add the master proxy client certificates to the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file on each master:
+
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  proxyClientInfo:
    certFile: master.proxy-client.crt
    keyFile: master.proxy-client.key
----

.. Enable the following renamed service(s) on master hosts.
+
----
# systemctl enable origin-master-api
# systemctl enable origin-master-controllers
----

. Restart the master service(s) on each master and review logs to ensure they
restart successfully.
+
----
# systemctl restart origin-master-api origin-master-controllers
# journalctl -r -u origin-master-controllers
# journalctl -r -u origin-master-api
----

. Because masters also have node components running on them in order to be
configured as part of the OpenShift SDN, restart the *origin-node* and
*openvswitch* services:
+
----
# systemctl restart openvswitch
# systemctl restart origin-node
# journalctl -r -u openvswitch
# journalctl -r -u origin-node
----
endif::[]

. Configure Dnsmasq. You must perform the following steps to configure dnsmasq
as part of the upgrade.
+
.. Create a *_/etc/origin/node/node-dnsmasq.conf_*  node configuration file.
+
----
server=/in-addr.arpa/127.0.0.1
server=/cluster.local/127.0.0.1
----

.. Edit the *_/etc/dnsmasq.d/origin-dns.conf_* file as follows:
+
----
no-resolv
domain-needed
no-negcache
max-cache-ttl=1
enable-dbus
dns-forward-max=5000
cache-size=5000
bind-dynamic
except-interface=lo
----

.. Edit the *_/etc/dnsmasq.d/origin-upstream-dns.conf_* file as follows:
+
----
server=<dns_server1_ip_address>
server=<dns_server2_ip_address>
----

.. Edit the *_/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml_* as follows:
+
----
dnsBindAddress: 127.0.0.1:53
dnsRecursiveResolvConf: /etc/origin/node/resolv.conf
dnsDomain: cluster.local
dnsIP: <node_ip_address> <1>
----
+
<1> This is the IP address of the node host.

.. Update the *_/etc/systemd/system/atomic-openshift-node.service_* node systemd unit file:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. On each master host, upgrade the *atomic-openshift* packages or related images.

.. For masters using the RPM-based method on a RHEL 7 system, upgrade all installed
*atomic-openshift* packages and the *openvswitch* package:
+
----
# yum upgrade atomic-openshift\* openvswitch
----

.. For masters using the containerized method on a RHEL 7 or RHEL Atomic Host 7
system, set the `*IMAGE_VERSION*` parameter to the version you are upgrading to
in the following files:
+
--
- *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master-controllers_*
- *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master-api_*
- *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-node_*
- *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-openvswitch_*
--
+
For example:
+
----
IMAGE_VERSION=<tag>
----
+
Replace `<tag>` with `{latest-tag}` for the latest version.

. Modify host labels and parameters.
+
In previous versions of {product-title}, master hosts were marked unschedulable
by default by the installer, meaning that no pods could be placed on the hosts.
Starting with {product-title} 3.9, however, the web console is removed from the
master services and deployed as a pod on the masters, requiring that masters be
marked schedulable. This change also requires hosts to have _node role_ labels,
either `master` or `compute`.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[NOTE]
====
You can see the {product-title} 3.9 Release Notes for more information on how
these notable technical changes relate in the context of supported automated
upgrades:

- xref:../release_notes/ocp_3_9_release_notes.adoc#ocp-39-schedulable-masters[Masters Marked as Schedulable Nodes by Default]
- xref:../release_notes/ocp_3_9_release_notes.adoc#ocp-39-default-node-selector[Default Node Selector Set By Default and Automatic Node Labeling]
====
endif::[]

If you are upgrading from {product-title} 3.7 to 3.9:

.. Add the following label to each master host:
+
----
$ oc label node <hostname> node-role.kubernetes.io/master=true
----
+
This assigns them the `master` node role.

.. Add the following label to each non-master, non-infrastructure (e.g.,
`region=infra` labeled) host:
+
----
$ oc label node <hostname> node-role.kubernetes.io/compute=true
----
+
This assigns them the `compute` node role.

.. The default node selector must also now be set to ensure that only the web
console pods will be scheduled to the masters. If you already have this set to a
custom value via `projectConfig.defaultNodeSelector` in the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file, you can skip this step. If you
have not previously set it, set it to the following:
+
----
projectConfig:
  defaultNodeSelector: node-role.kubernetes.io/compute=true
----

. Restart the master service(s) on each master and review logs to ensure they
restart successfully.
+
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-controllers
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-master-controllers
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-master-api
----

. Because masters also have node components running on them in order to be
configured as part of the OpenShift SDN, restart the *atomic-openshift-node* and
*openvswitch* services:
+
----
# systemctl restart openvswitch
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
# journalctl -r -u openvswitch
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-node
----

. If you are upgrading from {product-title} 3.7 to 3.9, run the following for each
master host to mark them schedulable:
+
----
$ oc adm manage-node <hostname> --schedulable=true
----
endif::[]

. If you are performing a cluster upgrade that requires updating Docker to version
1.13, you must also perform the following steps if you are not already on Docker
1.13:

.. Upgrade the *docker* package.

... For RHEL 7 systems:
+
----
# yum update docker
----
+
Then, restart the *docker* service and review the logs to ensure it restarts
successfully:
+
----
# systemctl restart docker
# journalctl -r -u docker
----

... For RHEL Atomic Host 7 systems, upgrade to the latest Atomic tree if one is
available:
+
----
# atomic host upgrade
----

.. After the upgrade is completed and prepared for the next boot, reboot the host
and ensure the *docker* service starts successfully:
+
----
# systemctl reboot
# journalctl -r -u docker
----

.. Remove the following file, which is no longer required:
+
----
# rm /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/docker-sdn-ovs.conf
----

. Run the following command on each master to add the *atomic-openshift* packages
back to the list of yum excludes on the host:
+
----
# atomic-openshift-excluder exclude
----

[NOTE]
====
During the cluster upgrade, it can sometimes be useful to take a master out of
rotation since some DNS client libraries will not properly to the other masters
for cluster DNS. In addition to stopping the master and controller services, you
can remove the EndPoint from the Kubernetes service's `*subsets.addresses*`.

----
$ oc edit ep/kubernetes -n default
----

When the master is restarted, the Kubernetes service will be automatically
updated.
====

[[updating-policy-definitions]]
== Updating Policy Definitions

During a cluster upgrade, and on every restart of any master, the
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[default
cluster roles] are automatically reconciled to restore any missing permissions.

. If you customized default cluster roles and want to ensure a role reconciliation
does not modify them, protect each role from reconciliation:
+
----
$ oc annotate clusterrole.rbac <role_name> --overwrite rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate=false
----
+
[WARNING]
====
You must manually update the roles that contain this setting to include any new
or required permissions after upgrading.
====

. Generate a default bootstrap policy template file:
+
----
$ oc adm create-bootstrap-policy-file --filename=policy.json
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The contents of the file vary based on the {product-title} version, but the file
contains only the default policies.
====

. Update the *_policy.json_* file to include any cluster role customizations.

. Use the policy file to automatically reconcile roles and role bindings that
are not reconcile protected:
+
----
$ oc process --local -f policy.json | oc auth reconcile -f policy.json
----

. Reconcile security context constraints:
+
----
# oc adm policy reconcile-sccs \
    --additive-only=true \
    --confirm
----

[[upgrading-nodes]]
== Upgrading Nodes

After upgrading your masters, you can upgrade your nodes. When restarting the
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*origin-node* service, there will be a brief disruption of outbound network
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*atomic-openshift-node* service, there will be a brief disruption of outbound network
endif::[]
connectivity from running pods to services while the
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#service-proxy[service
proxy] is restarted. The length of this disruption should be very short and
scales based on the number of services in the entire cluster.

[NOTE]
====
You can alternatively use the
xref:../upgrading/blue_green_deployments.adoc#upgrading-blue-green-deployments[blue-green
deployment] method at this point to create a parallel environment for new nodes
instead of upgrading them in place.
====

One at at time for each node that is not also a master, you must disable
scheduling and evacuate its pods to other nodes, then upgrade packages and
restart services.

. Run the following command on each node to remove the *atomic-openshift*
packages from the list of yum excludes on the host:
+
----
# atomic-openshift-excluder unexclude
----

. As a user with *cluster-admin* privileges, disable scheduling for the node:
+
----
# oc adm manage-node <node> --schedulable=false
----

. Evacuate pods on the node to other nodes:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `--force` option deletes any pods that are not backed by a replication
controller.
====
+
----
# oc adm drain <node> --force --delete-local-data --ignore-daemonsets
----

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
. On the node host, upgrade all *origin* packages:
+
----
# yum upgrade origin\*
----

. If you are upgrading from OpenShift Origin 1.0 to 1.1, enable the following
renamed service on the node host:
+
----
# systemctl enable origin-node
----

. Restart the *origin-node* and *openvswitch* services and review the logs to
ensure they restart successfully:
+
----
# systemctl restart openvswitch
# systemctl restart origin-node
# journalctl -r -u origin-node
# journalctl -r -u openvswitch
----

endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. Upgrade the node component packages or related images.

.. For nodes using the RPM-based method on a RHEL 7 system, upgrade all installed
*atomic-openshift* packages and the *openvswitch* package:
+
----
# yum upgrade atomic-openshift\* openvswitch
----

.. For nodes using the containerized method on a RHEL 7 or RHEL Atomic Host 7
system, set the `*IMAGE_VERSION*` parameter in the
*_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-node_* and *_/etc/sysconfig/openvswitch_*
files to the version you are upgrading to. For example:
+
----
IMAGE_VERSION=<tag>
----
+
Replace `<tag>` with `{latest-tag}` for the latest version.

. Restart the *atomic-openshift-node* and *openvswitch* services and review the
logs to ensure they restart successfully:
+
----
# systemctl restart openvswitch
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-node
# journalctl -r -u openvswitch
----
endif::[]

. If you are performing a cluster upgrade that requires updating Docker to version
1.13, you must also perform the following steps if you are not already on Docker
1.13:

.. Upgrade the *docker* package.

... For RHEL 7 systems:
+
----
# yum update docker
----
+
Then, restart the *docker* service and review the logs to ensure it restarts
successfully:
+
----
# systemctl restart docker
# journalctl -r -u docker
----
+
After Docker is restarted, restart the *atomic-openshift-node* service again and
review the logs to ensure it restarts successfully:
+
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-node
----

... For RHEL Atomic Host 7 systems, upgrade to the latest Atomic tree if one is
available:
+
----
# atomic host upgrade
----
+
After the upgrade is completed and prepared for the next boot, reboot the host
and ensure the *docker* service starts successfully:
+
----
# systemctl reboot
# journalctl -r -u docker
----

.. Remove the following file, which is no longer required:
+
----
# rm /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/docker-sdn-ovs.conf
----

. Re-enable scheduling for the node:
+
----
# oc adm manage-node <node> --schedulable
----

. Run the following command on each node to add the *atomic-openshift* packages
back to the list of yum excludes on the host:
+
----
# atomic-openshift-excluder exclude
----

. Repeat the previous steps on the next node, and continue repeating these steps
until all nodes have been upgraded.

. After all nodes have been upgraded, as a user with *cluster-admin* privileges,
verify that all nodes are showing as *Ready*:
+
----
# oc get nodes
NAME                   STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION

[[upgrading-the-router]]
== Upgrading the Router

If you have previously
xref:../install_config/router/index.adoc#install-config-router-overview[deployed a router], the
router deployment configuration must be upgraded to apply updates contained in
the router image. To upgrade your router without disrupting services, you must
have previously deployed a
xref:../admin_guide/high_availability.adoc#configuring-a-highly-available-service[highly available routing service].

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are upgrading to OpenShift Origin 1.0.4 or 1.0.5, first see the
xref:additional-instructions-per-release[Additional Manual Instructions per
Release] section for important steps specific to your upgrade, then continue
with the router upgrade as described in this section.
====
endif::[]

Edit your router's deployment configuration. For example, if it has the default
*router* name:

----
# oc edit dc/router
----

Apply the following changes:

----
...

        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ...
----
<1> Adjust `<tag>` to match the version you are upgrading to (use `{latest-tag}`
for the latest version).

You should see one router pod updated and then the next.

[[upgrading-the-registry]]
== Upgrading the Registry

The registry must also be upgraded for changes to take effect in the registry
image. If you have used a `*PersistentVolumeClaim*` or a host mount point, you
may restart the registry without losing the contents of your registry.
xref:../install_config/registry/deploy_registry_existing_clusters.adoc#storage-for-the-registry[Storage for the Registry] details how to configure persistent storage for the registry.

Edit your registry's deployment configuration:

----
# oc edit dc/docker-registry
----

Apply the following changes:

----
...
spec:
 template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:

        ...
----
<1> Adjust `<tag>` to match the version you are upgrading to (use `{latest-tag}`
for the latest version).

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
If the registry console is deployed, edit its deployment configuration:

----
# oc edit dc/registry-console
----

Apply the following changes:

        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ...
----
endif::[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Images that are being pushed or pulled from the internal registry at the time of
upgrade will fail and should be restarted automatically. This will not disrupt
pods that are already running.

=== Enforcing Quota in the Registry

Quota must be enforced to prevent layer blobs that exceed the size limit from
being written to the registry's storage. This can be achieved via a
xref:../install_config/registry/extended_registry_configuration.adoc#registry-configuration-reference[configuration file]:

----

----

Alternatively, use the `*REGISTRY_MIDDLEWARE_REPOSITORY_OPENSHIFT_ENFORCEQUOTA*`
environment variable, which is set to `*true*` for the new registry deployments
by default. Existing deployments need to be modified using:

----
# oc set env dc/docker-registry REGISTRY_MIDDLEWARE_REPOSITORY_OPENSHIFT_ENFORCEQUOTA=true

[[updating-the-default-image-streams-and-templates]]
== Updating the Default Image Streams and Templates

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
By default, the xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced
installation] method automatically creates default image streams, InstantApp
templates, and database service templates in the *openshift* project, which is a
default project to which all users have view access. These objects were created
during installation from the JSON files located under
*_/usr/share/openshift/examples_*.

To update these objects:

. Ensure that you have the latest *openshift-ansible* code checked out, which
provides the example JSON files:
+
----
# cd ~/openshift-ansible
# git pull https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible master
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
By default, the
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installation]
method automatically creates default image streams, InstantApp templates, and
database service templates in the *openshift* project, which is a default
project to which all users have view access. These objects were created during
installation from the JSON files located under the
*_/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/_*
directory.

[NOTE]
====
Because RHEL Atomic Host 7 cannot use *yum* to update packages, the following
steps must take place on a RHEL 7 system.
====

Update the packages that provide the example JSON files. On a subscribed Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 7 system where you can run the CLI as a user with
*cluster-admin* permissions, install or update to the latest version of the
*atomic-openshift-utils* package, which should also update the
*openshift-ansible-* packages:

----
# yum update atomic-openshift-utils
----

To persist *_/usr/share/openshift/examples/_* on the first master:

----
$ scp -R /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v3.9/* user@master1:/usr/share/openshift/examples/
----

To persist *_/usr/share/openshift/examples/_* on all masters:

----
$ mkdir /usr/share/openshift/examples
$ scp -R /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v3.9/* user@masterx:/usr/share/openshift/examples
----

The *openshift-ansible-roles* package provides the latest example JSON files.
endif::[]

. After a manual upgrade, get the latest templates from
*openshift-ansible-roles*:
+
----
# rpm -ql openshift-ansible-roles | grep examples | grep v3.9
----
+
In this example,
*_/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v3.9/image-streams/image-streams-rhel7.json_*
is the latest file that you want in the latest *openshift-ansible-roles* package.
+
*_/usr/share/openshift/examples/image-streams/image-streams-rhel7.json_* is not
owned by a package, but is updated by Ansible. If you are upgrading outside of
Ansible. you need to get the latest .json files on the system where you are
running `oc`, which can run anywhere that has access to the master.

// tag::30to31updatingcerts[]
[id='{sect}-updating-master-and-node-certificates']
== Updating Master and Node Certificates

The following steps may be required for any OpenShift cluster that was
originally installed prior to the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[OpenShift Origin 1.0.8 release].
This may include any and all updates from that version.

[id='{sect}-updating-node-certificates']
=== Node Certificates

With the 1.0.8 release, certificates for each of the kubelet nodes were updated
to include the IP address of the node. Any node certificates generated before
the 1.0.8 release may not contain the IP address of the node.

If a node is missing the IP address as part of its certificate, clients may
refuse to connect to the kubelet endpoint. Usually this will result in errors
regarding the certificate not containing an `IP SAN`.

In order to remedy this situation, you may need to manually update the
certificates for your node.

[id='{sect}-checking-the-nodes-certificate']
==== Checking the Node's Certificate

The following command can be used to determine which Subject Alternative Names
(SANs) are present in the node's serving certificate. In this example, the
Subject Alternative Names are *mynode*, *mynode.mydomain.com*, and *1.2.3.4*:

----
# openssl x509 -in /etc/origin/node/server.crt -text -noout | grep -A 1 "Subject Alternative Name"
X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
DNS:mynode, DNS:mynode.mydomain.com, IP: 1.2.3.4
----

Ensure that the `*nodeIP*` value set in the
*_/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml_* file is present in the IP values from the
Subject Alternative Names listed in the node's serving certificate. If the
`*nodeIP*` is not present, then it will need to be added to the node's
certificate.

If the `*nodeIP*` value is already contained within the Subject Alternative
Names, then no further steps are required.

You will need to know the Subject Alternative Names and `*nodeIP*` value for the
following steps.

[id='{sect}-generating-a-new-node-certificate']
==== Generating a New Node Certificate

If your current node certificate does not contain the proper IP address, then
you must regenerate a new certificate for your node.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Node certificates will be regenerated on the master (or first master) and are
then copied into place on node systems.
====

. Create a temporary directory in which to perform the following steps:
+
----
# mkdir /tmp/node_certificate_update
# cd /tmp/node_certificate_update
----

. Export the signing options:
+
----
# export signing_opts="--signer-cert=/etc/origin/master/ca.crt \
    --signer-key=/etc/origin/master/ca.key \
    --signer-serial=/etc/origin/master/ca.serial.txt"
----

. Generate the new certificate:
+
----
# oc adm ca create-server-cert --cert=server.crt \
  --key=server.key $signing_opts \
  --hostnames=<existing_SANs>,<nodeIP>
----
+
For example, if the Subject Alternative Names from before were *mynode*,
*mynode.mydomain.com*, and *1.2.3.4*, and the `*nodeIP*` was 10.10.10.1, then
you would need to run the following command:
+
----
# oc adm ca create-server-cert --cert=server.crt \
  --key=server.key $signing_opts \
  --hostnames=mynode,mynode.mydomain.com,1.2.3.4,10.10.10.1
----

[id='{sect}-replace-node-serving-certificates']
==== Replace Node Serving Certificates

Back up the existing *_/etc/origin/node/server.crt_* and
*_/etc/origin/node/server.key_* files for your node:

----
# mv /etc/origin/node/server.crt /etc/origin/node/server.crt.bak
# mv /etc/origin/node/server.key /etc/origin/node/server.key.bak
----

You must now copy the new *_server.crt_* and *_server.key_* created in the
temporary directory during the previous step:

----
# mv /tmp/node_certificate_update/server.crt /etc/origin/node/server.crt
# mv /tmp/node_certificate_update/server.key /etc/origin/node/server.key
----

After you have replaced the node's certificate, restart the node service:

----
# systemctl restart origin-node
----

[id='{sect}-updating-master-certificates']
=== Master Certificates

With the 1.0.8 release, certificates for each of the masters were updated to
include all names that pods may use to communicate with masters. Any master
certificates generated before the 1.0.8 release may not contain these additional
service names.

[id='{sect}-checking-the-masters-certificate']
==== Checking the Master's Certificate

The following command can be used to determine which Subject Alternative Names
(SANs) are present in the master's serving certificate. In this example, the
Subject Alternative Names are *mymaster*, *mymaster.mydomain.com*, and
*1.2.3.4*:

----
# openssl x509 -in /etc/origin/master/master.server.crt -text -noout | grep -A 1 "Subject Alternative Name"
X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
DNS:mymaster, DNS:mymaster.mydomain.com, IP: 1.2.3.4
----

Ensure that the following entries are present in the Subject Alternative Names
for the master's serving certificate:

[options="header"]
|===
|Entry |Example

|Kubernetes service IP address
|172.30.0.1

|All master host names
|*master1.example.com*

|All master IP addresses
|192.168.122.1

|Public master host name in clustered environments
|*public-master.example.com*

|*kubernetes*
|

|*kubernetes.default*
|

|*kubernetes.default.svc*
|

|*kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local*
|

|*openshift*
|

|*openshift.default*
|

|*openshift.default.svc*
|

|*openshift.default.svc.cluster.local*
|
|===

If these names are already contained within the Subject Alternative Names, then
no further steps are required.

[id='{sect}-generating-a-new-master-certificate']
==== Generating a New Master Certificate

If your current master certificate does not contain all names from the list
above, then you must generate a new certificate for your master:

. Back up the existing *_/etc/origin/master/master.server.crt_* and
*_/etc/origin/master/master.server.key_* files for your master:
+
----
# mv /etc/origin/master/master.server.crt /etc/origin/master/master.server.crt.bak
# mv /etc/origin/master/master.server.key /etc/origin/master/master.server.key.bak
----

. Export the service names. These names will be used when generating the new
certificate:
+
----
# export service_names="kubernetes,kubernetes.default,kubernetes.default.svc,kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local,openshift,openshift.default,openshift.default.svc,openshift.default.svc.cluster.local"
----

. You will need the first IP in the services
subnet (the *kubernetes* service IP) as well as the values of `*masterIP*`,
`*masterURL*` and `*publicMasterURL*` contained in the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file for the following steps.
+
The *kubernetes* service IP can be obtained with:
+
----
# oc get svc/kubernetes --template='{{.spec.clusterIP}}'
----

. Generate the new certificate:
+
----
# oc adm ca create-master-certs \
      --hostnames=<master_hostnames>,<master_IP_addresses>,<kubernetes_service_IP>,$service_names \ <1> <2> <3>
      --master=<internal_master_address> \ <4>
      --public-master=<public_master_address> \ <5>
      --cert-dir=/etc/origin/master/ \
      --overwrite=false
----
<1> Adjust `<master_hostnames>` to match your master host name. In a clustered
environment, add all master host names.
<2> Adjust `<master_IP_addresses>` to match the value of `*masterIP*`. In a
clustered environment, add all master IP addresses.
<3> Adjust `<kubernetes_service_IP>` to the first IP in the *kubernetes*
services subnet.
<4> Adjust `<internal_master_address>` to match the value of `*masterURL*`.
<5> Adjust `<public_master_address>` to match the value of `*masterPublicURL*`.

. Restart master services. For single master deployments:
+
----
# systemctl restart origin-master-api origin-master-controllers
----
+
After the service restarts, the certificate update is complete.
// end::30to31updatingcerts[]

[[openshift-origin-1-0-4]]
=== OpenShift Origin 1.0.4

The following steps are required for the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/tag/v1.0.4[OpenShift Origin 1.0.4
release].

*Creating a Service Account for the Router*

The default HAProxy router was updated to utilize host ports and requires that a
service account be created and made a member of the privileged
xref:../admin_guide/manage_scc.adoc#admin-guide-manage-scc[security context constraint] (SCC).
Additionally, "down-then-up" rolling upgrades have been added and is now the
preferred strategy for upgrading routers.

After upgrading your master and nodes but before updating to the newer router,
you must create a service account for the router. As a cluster administrator,
ensure you are operating on the *default* project:

----
# oc project default
----

Delete any existing *router* service account and create a new one:

----
# oc delete serviceaccount/router
serviceaccounts/router

# echo '{"kind":"ServiceAccount","apiVersion":"v1","metadata":{"name":"router"}}' | oc create -f -
serviceaccounts/router
----

Edit the *privileged* SCC:

----
# oc edit scc privileged
----

Apply the following changes:

----
allowHostDirVolumePlugin: true
allowHostNetwork: true <1>
allowHostPorts: true <2>
allowPrivilegedContainer: true
...
users:
- system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:build-controller
- system:serviceaccount:default:router <3>
----
<1> Add or update `allowHostNetwork: true`.
<2> Add or update `allowHostPorts: true`.
<3> Add the service account you created to the `*users*` list at the end of the
file.

Edit your router's deployment configuration:

----
# oc edit dc/router
----

Apply the following changes:

----
...
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    router: router
  strategy:
    resources: {}
    rollingParams:
      intervalSeconds: 1
      timeoutSeconds: 120
      updatePeriodSeconds: 1
      updatePercent: -10 <1>
    type: Rolling
    ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      ...
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      restartPolicy: Always
      serviceAccount: router <2>
      serviceAccountName: router <3>
...
----
<1> Add `updatePercent: -10` to allow down-then-up rolling upgrades.
<2> Add `serviceAccount: router` to the template `*spec*`.
<3> Add `serviceAccountName: router` to the template `*spec*`.

Now upgrade your router per the xref:upgrading-the-router[standard router
upgrade steps].

[[openshift-origin-1-0-5]]
=== OpenShift Origin 1.0.5

The following steps are required for the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[OpenShift Origin 1.0.5
release].

*Switching the Router to Use the Host Network Stack*

The default HAProxy router was updated to use the host networking stack by
default instead of the former behavior of
xref:../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#using-the-container-network-stack[using
the container network stack], which proxied traffic to the router, which in turn
proxied the traffic to the target service and container. This new default
behavior benefits performance because network traffic from remote clients no
longer needs to take multiple hops through user space in order to reach the
target service and container.

Additionally, the new default behavior enables the router to get the actual
source IP address of the remote connection. This is useful for defining
ingress rules based on the originating IP, supporting sticky sessions, and
monitoring traffic, among other uses.

Existing router deployments will continue to use the container network stack
unless modified to switch to using the host network stack.

To switch the router to use the host network stack, edit your router's
deployment configuration:

----
# oc edit dc/router
----

Apply the following changes:

----
...
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    router: router
    ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      ...
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80 <1>
          hostPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
        - containerPort: 443 <1>
          hostPort: 443
          protocol: TCP

<1> For host networking, ensure that the `*containerPort*` value matches the
`*hostPort*` values for each of the ports.
<2> Add `*hostNetwork: true*` to the template `*spec*`.

Now upgrade your router per the xref:upgrading-the-router[standard router
upgrade steps].

*Configuring serviceNetworkCIDR for the SDN*

Add the `*serviceNetworkCIDR*` parameter to the `*networkConfig*` section in
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*. This value should match the
`*servicesSubnet*` value in the `*kubernetesMasterConfig*` section:

----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  servicesSubnet: 172.30.0.0/16
...
networkConfig:
  serviceNetworkCIDR: 172.30.0.0/16
----

*Adding the Scheduler Configuration API Version*

The scheduler configuration file incorrectly lacked `*kind*` and `*apiVersion*`
fields when deployed using the quick or advanced installation methods. This will
affect future upgrades, so it is important to add those values if they do not
exist.

Modify the *_/etc/origin/master/scheduler.json_* file to add the `*kind*` and
`*apiVersion*` fields:

----
{
  "kind": "Policy", <1>
  "apiVersion": "v1", <2>
  "predicates": [
  ...
}
----
<1> Add `*"kind": "Policy",*`
<2> Add `*"apiVersion": "v1",*`

[[openshift-origin-1-1-0]]
=== OpenShift Origin 1.1.0

There are no additional manual steps for this release that are not already
mentioned inline during the xref:preparing-for-a-manual-upgrade[standard manual upgrade
process].

[[openshift-origin-1-5-0]]
=== OpenShift Origin 1.5.0

With deprecation of the `extensions/v1beta1.Job` resource, you must migrate all
`Job` resources to use the `batch/v1.Job` instead. To verify which objects will
be migrated, run:

----
$ oc adm migrate storage --include=jobs
----

You can also increase the log level using the `--loglevel` flag. When you are
ready to perform the actual migration, add the `--confirm` option:

----
$ oc adm migrate storage --include=jobs --confirm
----

== Verifying the Upgrade

To verify the upgrade:

. Check that all nodes are marked as *Ready*:
+
----
# oc get nodes
NAME                   STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
master.example.com     Ready     master    7h        v1.9.1+a0ce1bc657
node1.example.com      Ready     compute   7h        v1.9.1+a0ce1bc657
node2.example.com      Ready     compute   7h        v1.9.1+a0ce1bc657
----

. Verify that you are running the expected versions of the *docker-registry*
and *router* images, if deployed.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Replace `<tag>` with `{latest-tag}` for the latest version.
endif::[]
+
----
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# oc get -n default dc/docker-registry -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift3/ose-docker-registry:<tag>",
# oc get -n default dc/router -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift3/ose-haproxy-router:<tag>",

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# oc get -n default dc/docker-registry -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift/origin-docker-registry:v1.0.6",
# oc get -n default dc/router -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift/origin-haproxy-router:v1.0.6",
endif::[]
----

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
. If you upgraded from Origin 1.0 to Origin 1.1, verify in your old
*_/etc/sysconfig/openshift-master_* and *_/etc/sysconfig/openshift-node_* files
that any custom configuration is added to your new
*_/etc/sysconfig/origin-master_* and *_/etc/sysconfig/origin-node_* files.
endif::[]

. Use the diagnostics tool on the master to look for common issues:
