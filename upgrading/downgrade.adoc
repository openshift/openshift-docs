== Overview

Following an {product-title}
xref:../upgrading/index.adoc#install-config-upgrading-index[upgrade],
it may be desirable in extreme cases to downgrade your cluster to a previous
version. The following sections outline the required steps for each system in a
cluster to perform such a downgrade for the {product-title} 3.10 to 3.9 downgrade
path.

[IMPORTANT]
====
These steps are currently only supported for
xref:../install/index.adoc#planning-installation-types[RPM-based
installations] of {product-title} and assumes downtime of the entire cluster.
====

[[downgrade-verifying-backups]]
== Verifying Backups

. The Ansible playbook used during the
xref:../upgrading/index.adoc#install-config-upgrading-index[upgrade process]
should have created a backup of the *_master-config.yaml_* file. Ensure this and
the *_scheduler.json_* file exist on your masters:
+
----
/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml.<timestamp>
/etc/origin/master/scheduler.json
----

. The procedure in xref:automated_upgrades.adoc#preparing-for-an-automated-upgrade[Preparing for an Automated Upgrade]
instructed you to back up the following files before proceeding with an upgrade
from {product-title} 3.9 to 3.10; ensure that you still have these files
available.
+
On master hosts:
+
----
/usr/lib/systemd/system/atomic-openshift-master-api.service
/usr/lib/systemd/system/atomic-openshift-master-controllers.service
/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master-api
/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master-controllers
----
+
On node and master hosts:
+
----
/usr/lib/systemd/system/atomic-openshift-*.service
/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml
----
+
On etcd hosts, including masters that have etcd co-located on them:
+
----
/etc/etcd/etcd.conf
/backup/etcd-xxxxxx/backup.db
----

[[downgrade-shutting-down-the-cluster]]
== Shutting Down the Cluster

. On all master and node hosts:
+
----
# systemctl stop atomic-openshift-node
----

[[downgrade-removing-rpms]]
== Removing RPMs and Static Pods

The **-excluder* packages add entries to the exclude directive in the hostâ€™s
*_/etc/yum.conf_* file when installed.

. On all masters, nodes, and etcd members (if using a dedicated etcd cluster),
remove the following packages:
+
----
# yum remove atomic-openshift \
    atomic-openshift-clients \
    atomic-openshift-node \
    atomic-openshift-master \
    atomic-openshift-sdn-ovs \
    atomic-openshift-excluder \
    atomic-openshift-docker-excluder \
    atomic-openshift-hyperkube
----

. Verify the packages were removed successfully:
+
----
# rpm -qa | grep atomic-openshift
----

. On control plane hosts (master and etcd hosts), move the static pod definitions:
+
----
# mkdir /etc/origin/node/pods-backup
# mv /etc/origin/node/pods/* /etc/origin/node/pods-backup/
----

. Reboot each host:
+
----
# systemctl reboot
----

[[downgrade-docker]]
== Downgrading Docker

Both {product-title} 3.9 and 3.10 require Docker 1.13, so Docker does not need
to be downgraded.

[[downgrade-reinstalling-rpms]]
== Reinstalling RPMs

. Disable the {product-title} 3.10 repositories, and re-enable the 3.9
repositories:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos \
    --disable=rhel-7-server-ose-3.10-rpms \
    --enable=rhel-7-server-ose-3.9-rpms
----

. On each master, install the following packages:
+
----
# yum install atomic-openshift \
    atomic-openshift-clients \
    atomic-openshift-node \
    atomic-openshift-master \
    openvswitch \
    atomic-openshift-sdn-ovs \
    tuned-profiles-atomic-openshift-node \
    atomic-openshift-excluder \
    atomic-openshift-docker-excluder
----

. On each node, install the following packages:
+
----
# yum install atomic-openshift \
    atomic-openshift-node \
    openvswitch \
    atomic-openshift-sdn-ovs \
    tuned-profiles-atomic-openshift-node \
    atomic-openshift-excluder \
    atomic-openshift-docker-excluder
----

. On each host, verify the packages were installed successfully:
+
----
# rpm -qa | grep atomic-openshift
# rpm -q openvswitch
----

[[verifying-the-downgrade]]
== Verifying the Downgrade

. To verify the downgrade, first check that all nodes are marked as *Ready*:
+
----
# oc get nodes
NAME                        STATUS                     AGE
master.example.com          Ready,SchedulingDisabled   165d
node1.example.com           Ready                      165d
node2.example.com           Ready                      165d
----

. Verify the successful downgrade of the registry and router, if deployed:

.. Verify you are running the `v3.9` versions of the *docker-registry*
and *router* images:
+
----
# oc get -n default dc/docker-registry -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift3/ose-docker-registry:v3.9",
# oc get -n default dc/router -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift3/ose-haproxy-router:v3.9",
----

.. Verify that *docker-registry* and *router* pods are running and in ready state:
+
----
# oc get pods -n default

NAME                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
docker-registry-2-b7xbn    1/1       Running   0          18m
router-2-mvq6p             1/1       Running   0          6m
----

. Use the
xref:../admin_guide/diagnostics_tool.adoc#admin-guide-diagnostics-tool[diagnostics tool]
on the master to look for common issues and provide suggestions:
+
----
# oc adm diagnostics
...
[Note] Summary of diagnostics execution:
[Note] Completed with no errors or warnings seen.
