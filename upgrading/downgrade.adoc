toc::[]

== Overview

Following an {product-title}
xref:../upgrading/index.adoc#install-config-upgrading-index[upgrade],
it may be desirable in extreme cases to downgrade your cluster to a previous
version. The following sections outline the required steps for each system in a
cluster to perform such a downgrade for the {product-title} 3.9 to 3.7 downgrade
path.

[WARNING]
====
These steps are currently only supported for
xref:../install_config/install/rpm_vs_containerized.adoc#install-config-install-rpm-vs-containerized[RPM-based
installations] of {product-title} and assumes downtime of the entire cluster.
====

[[downgrade-verifying-backups]]
== Verifying Backups

The Ansible playbook used during the
xref:../upgrading/index.adoc#install-config-upgrading-index[upgrade
process] should have created a backup of the *_master-config.yaml_* file and the
etcd data directory. Ensure these exist on your masters and etcd members:

----
/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml.<timestamp>
/var/lib/etcd/openshift-backup-pre-upgrade-<timestamp>
----

Also, back up the *_node-config.yaml_* file on each node (including masters,
which have the node component on them) with a timestamp:

----
/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml.<timestamp>
----

When using an external etcd cluster, the backup is created on all etcd
members, though only one is required for the recovery process.

The RPM downgrade process in a later step should create *_.rpmsave_* backups of
the following files, but it may be a good idea to keep a separate copy
regardless:

----
/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master
/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master-api
/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master-controller
/etc/etcd/etcd.conf <1>
----
<1> Only required if using external etcd.

[[downgrade-shutting-down-the-cluster]]
== Shutting Down the Cluster

On all masters, nodes, and etcd members (if using an external etcd cluster),
ensure the relevant services are stopped.

----
# systemctl stop atomic-openshift-master-api atomic-openshift-master-controllers
----

On all master and node hosts:

----
# systemctl stop atomic-openshift-node
----

On any external etcd hosts:

----
# systemctl stop etcd
----

[[downgrade-removing-rpms]]
== Removing RPMs

. The **-excluder* packages add entries to the exclude directive in the hostâ€™s
*_/etc/yum.conf_* file when installed. Run the following command on each host to
remove the `atomic-openshift-*` and `docker` packages from the exclude list:
+
----
# atomic-openshift-excluder unexclude
# atomic-openshift-docker-excluder unexclude
----

. On all masters, nodes, and etcd members (if using an external etcd cluster),
remove the following packages:
+
----
# yum remove atomic-openshift \
    atomic-openshift-clients \
    atomic-openshift-node \
    atomic-openshift-master-api \
    atomic-openshift-master-controllers \
    openvswitch \
    atomic-openshift-sdn-ovs \
    tuned-profiles-atomic-openshift-node\
    atomic-openshift-excluder\
    atomic-openshift-docker-excluder
----

. If you are using external etcd, also remove the *etcd* package:
+
----
# yum remove etcd
----
+
If using the embedded etcd, leave the *etcd* package installed. It is required
for running the `etcdctl` command to issue operations in later steps.

[[downgrade-docker]]
== Downgrading Docker

{product-title} 3.9 requires Docker 1.13, while {product-title} 3.7 requires Docker 1.12.

On any host running Docker 1.13, downgrade to Docker 1.12 using the following steps:

. Remove all local containers and images on the host. Any pods backed by a
replication controller will be recreated.
+
[WARNING]
====
The following commands are destructive and should be used with caution.
====
+
Delete all containers:
+
----
# docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
----
+
Delete all images:
+
----
# docker rmi $(docker images -q)
----

. Use `yum swap` (instead of `yum downgrade`) to install Docker 1.12.6:
+
----
# yum swap docker-* docker-*1.12.6
# sed -i 's/--storage-opt dm.use_deferred_deletion=true//' /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage
# systemctl restart docker
----

. You should now have Docker 1.12.6 installed and running on the host. Verify
with the following:
+
----
# docker version
# systemctl status docker
----

[[downgrade-reinstalling-rpms]]
== Reinstalling RPMs

Disable the {product-title} 3.8 and 3.9 repositories, and re-enable the 3.7
repositories:

----
# subscription-manager repos \
    --disable=rhel-7-server-ose-3.8-rpms \
    --disable=rhel-7-server-ose-3.9-rpms \
    --enable=rhel-7-server-ose-3.7-rpms
----

On each master, install the following packages:

----
# yum install atomic-openshift \
    atomic-openshift-clients \
    atomic-openshift-node \
    atomic-openshift-master-api \
    atomic-openshift-master-controllers \
    openvswitch \
    atomic-openshift-sdn-ovs \
    tuned-profiles-atomic-openshift-node \
    atomic-openshift-excluder \
    atomic-openshift-docker-excluder
----

On each node, install the following packages:

----
# yum install atomic-openshift \
    atomic-openshift-node \
    openvswitch \
    atomic-openshift-sdn-ovs \
    tuned-profiles-atomic-openshift-node \
    atomic-openshift-excluder \
    atomic-openshift-docker-excluder
----

If using an external etcd cluster, install the following package on each etcd
member:

----
# yum install etcd
----

[[verifying-the-downgrade]]
== Verifying the Downgrade

. To verify the downgrade, first check that all nodes are marked as *Ready*:
+
----
# oc get nodes
NAME                        STATUS                     AGE
master.example.com          Ready,SchedulingDisabled   165d
node1.example.com           Ready                      165d
node2.example.com           Ready                      165d
----

. Then, verify that you are running the expected versions of the *docker-registry*
and *router* images, if deployed:
+
----
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# oc get -n default dc/docker-registry -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift3/ose-docker-registry:v3.7.23",
# oc get -n default dc/router -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift3/ose-haproxy-router:v3.7.23",
----

. You can use the
xref:../admin_guide/diagnostics_tool.adoc#admin-guide-diagnostics-tool[diagnostics
tool] on the master to look for common issues and provide suggestions:
+
----
# oc adm diagnostics
...
