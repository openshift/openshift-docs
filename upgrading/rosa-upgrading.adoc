== Upgrading a ROSA cluster
There are three methods to upgrade {product-title} (ROSA) clusters:

* Individual upgrades through the ROSA CLI (`rosa`)
* Individual upgrades through the {cluster-manager-url} console
* Recurring upgrades through the {cluster-manager-url} console

[NOTE]
====
For steps to upgrade a ROSA cluster that uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS), see xref:../upgrading/rosa-upgrading-sts.adoc#rosa-upgrading-sts[Upgrading ROSA clusters with STS].

When following a scheduled upgrade policy, there might be a delay of an hour or more before the upgrade process begins, even if it is an immediate upgrade. Additionally, the duration of the upgrade might vary based on your workload configuration.
