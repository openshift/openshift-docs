== Upgrading a ROSA cluster
There are three methods to upgrade {product-title} (ROSA) clusters:

* Individual upgrades through the ROSA CLI (`rosa`)
* Individual upgrades through the {cluster-manager-url}
* Recurring upgrades through the {cluster-manager-url}

[NOTE]

For steps to upgrade a ROSA cluster that uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS), see xref:../upgrading/rosa-upgrading-sts.adoc#rosa-upgrading-sts[Upgrading ROSA clusters with STS].
