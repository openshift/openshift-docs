== Overview

Until {product-title} 3.6, it was possible to deploy a cluster with an embedded
etcd. As of {product-title} 3.7, this is no longer possible. Additionally, the
etcd API version since {product-title} 3.6 defaults to v3. Also, since
{product-title} 3.7, the v3 is the only version allowed. Therefore, older
deployments with embedded etcd with the etcd API version v2 need to migrate to
the external etcd first,
xref:../upgrading/migrating_etcd.adoc#install-config-upgrading-etcd-data-migration[followed
by data migration], before they can be upgraded to {product-title} 3.7.

This migration process performs the following steps:

. Stop the master service.
. Perform an etcd backup of embedded etcd.
. Deploy external etcd (on the master or new host).
. Perform a backup of the original etcd master certificates.
. Generate new etcd certificates for the master.
. Transfer the embedded etcd backup to the external etcd host.
. Start the external etcd from the transfered etcd backup.
. Re-configure master to use the external etcd.
. Start master.

== Running the Automated Migration Playbook

Migration to external RPM etcd or external containerized etcd is currently
supported.

A migration playbook is provided to automate all aspects of the process; this is
the preferred method for performing the migration. You must have access to your
existing inventory file with both the master and external etcd host defined in
their separate groups.

In order to perform the migration on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host, you
must be running Atomic Host 7.4 or later.

. Pull the latest subscription data from RHSM:
+
----
# subscription-manager refresh
----

. To get the latest playbooks, manually disable the {product-title} 3.6 channel
and enable the 3.7 channel on the host you are running the migration from:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --disable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.6-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.7-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-fast-datapath-rpms"
# yum clean all
----

. Add `etcd` under the `[OSEv3:children]` section if it does not already exist:
+
----
[OSEv3:children]
masters
nodes
etcd
----

. Your inventory file is expected to have exactly one host in an `[etcd]` host group. In
most scenarios, it is best to use your existing master, as there is no need for
a separate host.
+
Add an `[etcd]` host group to your inventory file if it does not already exist,
and list the host to migrate your etcd to:
+
----
[etcd]
master1.example.com
----

. Run the *_embedded2external.yml_* playbook using your inventory file:
+
----
# ansible-playbook [-i /path/to/inventory] \
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-etcd/embedded2external.yml
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
    ~/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-etcd/embedded2external.yml
endif::[]
----
+
Successful completion of the playbook will show the following:
+
----
INSTALLER STATUS **************************************
Initialization             : Complete
etcd Install               : Complete
----

. To verify that the migration from embedded to external etcd was successful, run
the following on the etcd host and check for an `etcd` process:
+
----
# ps -aux | grep etcd
etcd      22384  2.1  3.9 5872848 306072 ?      Ssl  10:36   0:02 /usr/bin/etcd --name=master1.example.com --data-dir=/var/lib/etcd/ --listen-client-urls=https://192.168.122.197:2379

[[etcd-embedded-migration-manual]]
== Running the Manual Migration

Currently, manual migration is not recommended, as it requires a deployment of
the new etcd cluster and re-deployment of etcd master certificates.
