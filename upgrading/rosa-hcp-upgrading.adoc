== Life cycle policies and planning

To plan an upgrade, review the xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-life-cycle.adoc#rosa-life-cycle[{product-title} update life cycle]. The life cycle page includes release definitions, support and upgrade requirements, installation policy information and life cycle dates.

You can manually upgrade your cluster. Red Hat Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) monitor upgrade progress and remedy any issues encountered.

== Upgrading a ROSA cluster
You can upgrade {hcp-title-first} clusters by using individual upgrades through the {product-title} (ROSA) CLI, `rosa`.

[NOTE]
====
When following a scheduled upgrade policy, there might be a delay of no more than thirty minutes before the upgrade process begins, even if it is an immediate upgrade. Additionally, the duration of the upgrade might vary based on your workload configuration and with machine pool upgrades, the number of worker nodes.
