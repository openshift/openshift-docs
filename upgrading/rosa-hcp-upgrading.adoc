== Upgrading a ROSA cluster
You can upgrade {hcp-title-first} clusters by using individual upgrades through the `rosa` CLI.

[NOTE]
====
When following a scheduled upgrade policy, there might be a delay of no more than thirty minutes before the upgrade process begins, even if it is an immediate upgrade. Additionally, the duration of the upgrade might vary based on your workload configuration and with machine pool upgrades, the number of worker nodes.
