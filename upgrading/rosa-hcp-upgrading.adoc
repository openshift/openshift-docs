== Life cycle policies and planning

To plan an upgrade, review the
xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-hcp-life-cycle.adoc#rosa-hcp-life-cycle[{product-title} update life cycle].

The life cycle page includes release definitions, support and upgrade requirements, installation policy information and life cycle dates.

Upgrades are manually initiated or automatically scheduled. Red Hat Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) monitor upgrade progress and remedy any issues encountered.

//The following note should be removed when the entire HCP fleet is confirmed multi-arch
[NOTE]
====
If your control plane is not currently multi-architecture enabled, the upgrade process will first migrate the cluster to a multi-architecture image and then apply the version upgrade. Multi-architecture clusters are capable of running both x86-based and Arm-based workloads. Clusters created after 25 July, 2024 are multi-architecture enabled by default.
