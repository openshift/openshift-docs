== Upgrading the whole cluster with the ROSA CLI

Upgrading the entire cluster involves upgrading both the hosted control plane and nodes in the machine pools. However, these components cannot be upgraded at the same time. They must be upgraded in sequence. This can be done in any order. However, to maintain compatibility between nodes in the cluster, nodes in machine pools cannot use a newer version than the hosted control plane. Therefore, if both the hosted control plane and the nodes in your machine pools require upgrade to the same OpenShift version, you must upgrade the hosted control plane first, followed by the machine pools.

=== Prerequisites
* You have installed and configured the latest version of the ROSA CLI.
* No other upgrades are in progress or scheduled to take place at the same time as this upgrade.
