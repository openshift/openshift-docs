You can install Jaeger on {product-title} in either of two ways:

* You can install Jaeger as part of Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh. Jaeger is included by default in the Service Mesh installation.  To install Jaeger as part of a service mesh, follow the xref:../../service_mesh/v2x/preparing-ossm-installation.adoc#preparing-ossm-installation[Red Hat Service Mesh Installation] instructions.  Jaeger must be installed in the same namespace as your service mesh, that is, the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` and the Jaeger resources must be in the same namespace.

* If you do not want to install a service mesh, you can use the Jaeger Operator to install {ProductName} by itself.  To install Jaeger without a service mesh, use the following instructions.


== Prerequisites

Before you can install {ProductName}, review the installation activities, and ensure that you meet the prerequisites:

* Possess an active {product-title} subscription on your Red Hat account. If you do not have a subscription, contact your sales representative for more information.

* Review the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#installation-overview_architecture-installation[{product-title} {product-version} overview].
* Install {product-title} {product-version}.
