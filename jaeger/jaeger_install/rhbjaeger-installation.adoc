You can install Jaeger on {product-title} in either of two ways:

* You can install Jaeger as part of Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh. Jaeger is included by default in the Service Mesh installation.  To install Jaeger as part of a service mesh, follow the xref:../../service_mesh/service_mesh_install/preparing-ossm-installation.adoc#preparing-ossm-installation[Red Hat Service Mesh Installation] instructions.

* If you do not want to install a service mesh, you can use the Jaeger Operator to install the Red Hat build of Jaeger by itself.  To install Jaeger without a service mesh, use the following instructions.
