The Jaeger Operator uses a custom resource definition (CRD) to define 



When you use the Jaeger Operator to create an instance of Jaeger, you can either install the default configuration, or modify the custom resource definition (CRD) to better suit your business requirements.

The Jaeger Operator then uses the CRD when creating Jaeger instances.

Each Jaeger instance is associated with a deployment strategy. The strategy is defined in the custom resource file, and determines the architecture to be used for the Jaeger backend.  The default strategy is `allInOne`. The other possible values are `production` and `streaming`.

This section describes configuration that is performed in the custom resource definition (CRD) or in the custom resource (CR) file.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the {product-title} web console with `cluster-admin` user privileges.
* If you require persistent storage, Elasticsearch Operator must be installed.
* Jaeger operator has been installed.

// The following include statements pull in the module files that comprise the assembly.

TODO
Determine if you need a file just for customizing the CRD?  Do you want to move the other topics into a "tuning" assembly?
