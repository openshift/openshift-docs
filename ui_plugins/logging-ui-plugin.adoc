The logging UI plugin surfaces logging data in the {ocp-product-title} web console on the *Observe* -> *Logs* page.
You can specify filters, queries, time ranges and refresh rates, with the results displayed as a list of collapsed logs, which can then be expanded to show more detailed information for each log.

If you also deploy the Troubleshooting UI plugin on {ocp-product-title} version 4.16+, it connects to the Korrel8r service and adds direct links to the web console, from the **Observe** -> **Logs** page, to the **Observe** -> **Metrics** page with a correlated PromQL query. The plugin also adds a **See Related Logs** link from the web console alerting detail page, at **Observe** -> **Alerting**,  to the **Observe** -> **Logs** page with a correlated filter set selected.

The features of the plugin are categorized as:

dev-console::	Adds the logging view to web console.
alerts::	Merges the web console alerts with log-based alerts defined in the Loki ruler. Adds a log-based metrics chart in the alert detail view.
dev-alerts::	Merges the web console alerts with log-based alerts defined in the Loki ruler. Adds a log-based metrics chart in the alert detail view for the web console.
