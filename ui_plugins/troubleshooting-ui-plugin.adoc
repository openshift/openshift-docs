The troubleshooting panel UI plugin provides observability signal correlation.
With the troubleshooting panel, which is available from the Application Launcher {launch},
you can easily navigate to resources, metrics, logs, alerts, netflows, and other observability signals
that are correlated to the current contents of the console screen.

The panel displays an interactive node graph in the {ocp-product-title} web console.
Nodes in the graph represent a type of resource or signal, while edges represent relationships.
When you click on a node, you are automatically redirected to the corresponding web console page.
