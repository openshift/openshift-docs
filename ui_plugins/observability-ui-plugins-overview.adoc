[role="_abstract"]
You can use the {coo-first} to install and manage UI plugins to enhance the observability capabilities of the {ocp-product-title} web console.
The plugins extend the default functionality, providing new UI features for troubleshooting, distributed tracing, and cluster logging.

[id="monitoring_{context}"]
== Monitoring

The monitoring UI plugin adds monitoring related UI features to the {ocp-product-title} web console, for the Advance Cluster Management (ACM) perspective and for incident detection.

* **ACM:** The monitoring plugin in {coo-first} allows it to function in {rh-rhacm-first} environments, providing ACM with the same monitoring capabilities as {ocp-product-title}.

* **Incident Detection:** The incident detection feature groups alerts into incidents to help you identify the root causes of alert bursts instead of being overwhelmed by individual alerts. It presents a timeline of incidents, color-coded by severity, and you can drill down into the individual alerts within an incident. The system also categorizes alerts by affected component to help you focus on the most critical areas first.

For more information, see the xref:../ui_plugins/monitoring-ui-plugin.adoc#monitoring-ui-plugin[monitoring UI plugin] page.

[id="cluster-logging_{context}"]
== Cluster logging

The logging UI plugin surfaces logging data in the web console on the  *Observe* -> *Logs* page.
You can specify filters, queries, time ranges and refresh rates. The results displayed a list of collapsed logs, which can then be expanded to show more detailed information for each log.

For more information, see the xref:../ui_plugins/logging-ui-plugin.adoc#logging-ui-plugin[logging UI plugin] page.

[id="troubleshooting_{context}"]
== Troubleshooting

The troubleshooting panel UI plugin for {ocp-product-title} version 4.19+ provides observability signal correlation, powered by the open source Korrel8r project.
You can use the troubleshooting panel available from the *Observe* -> *Alerting* page to easily correlate metrics, logs, alerts, netflows, and additional observability signals and resources, across different data stores.
You can also access the troubleshooting UI panel from the Application Launcher {launch}.

The output of Korrel8r is displayed as an interactive node graph. When you click on a node, you are automatically redirected to the corresponding web console page with the specific information for that node, for example, metric, log, or pod.

For more information, see the xref:../ui_plugins/troubleshooting-ui-plugin.adoc#troubleshooting-ui-plugin[troubleshooting UI plugin] page.

[id="distributed-tracing_{context}"]
== Distributed tracing

The distributed tracing UI plugin adds tracing-related features to the web console on the *Observe* -> *Traces* page.
You can follow requests through the front end and into the backend of microservices, helping you identify code errors and performance bottlenecks in distributed systems.
You can select a supported `TempoStack` or `TempoMonolithic` multi-tenant instance running in the cluster and set a time range and query to view the trace data.

For more information, see the xref:../ui_plugins/distributed-tracing-ui-plugin.adoc#distributed-tracing-ui-plugin[distributed tracing UI plugin] page.

[id="dashboards_{context}"]
== Dashboards

The dashboard UI plugin supports enhanced dashboards in the {ocp-product-title} web console at *Observe* -> *Dashboards*.
You can add other Prometheus data sources from the cluster to the default dashboards, in addition to the in-cluster data source.
This results in a unified observability experience across different data sources.

For more information, see the xref :../ui_plugins/dashboard-ui-plugin.adoc#dashboard-ui-plugin[dashboard UI plugin] page.
