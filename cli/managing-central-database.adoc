== Backing up Central database by using the roxctl CLI
Backing up the Central database is critical to ensure data integrity and system reliability. Regular backups of the database, containing necessary configurations, resources, events, and certificates, protect against database failures, corruption, and accidental data loss.

You can use the `roxctl` CLI to take the backups by using the `backup` command. You require an API token or your administrator password to run this command.
