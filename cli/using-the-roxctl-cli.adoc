== Getting authentication information

The following procedure describes how to use the `roxctl central whoami` command to retrieve information about your authentication status and user profile in Central. The example output illustrates the data you can expect to see, including user roles, access permissions, and various administrative functions. This step allows you to review your access and roles within Central.

.Procedure

* Run the following command to get information about your current authentication status and user information in Central:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ roxctl central whoami
----

[id="authenticating-by-using-the-roxctl-cli_{context}"]
== Authenticating by using the roxctl CLI

For authentication, you can use an API token, your administrator password, or the `roxctl central login` command.

Follow these guidelines for the effective use of API tokens:

* Use an API token in a production environment with continuous integration (CI). Each token is assigned specific access permissions, providing control over the actions it can perform. In addition, API tokens do not require interactive processes, such as browser-based logins, making them ideal for automated processes. These tokens have a time-to-live (TTL) value of 1 year, providing a longer validity period for seamless integration and operational efficiency.

* Use your administrator password only for testing purposes. Do not use it in the production environment.

* Use the `roxctl central login` command only for interactive, local uses.
