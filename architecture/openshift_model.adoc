== Overview
OpenShift extends the base Kubernetes model to provide a more feature rich development lifecycle platform.

== Build

== BuildConfig

=== Build Strategies
The OpenShift build system provides extensible support for build strategies based on selectable types specified in the build API. By default, two strategies are supported: Docker builds, and Source-to-Image builds.

==== Docker build
OpenShift supports pure Docker builds. Using this strategy, users may supply a URL to a Docker context which is used as the basis for a https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#build[Docker build].

==== Source-to-Image
Source-to-image (sti) is a tool for building reproducible Docker images. It produces ready-to-run images by injecting a user source into a docker image and assembling a new Docker image which incorporates the base image and built source, and is ready to use with `docker run`. STI supports incremental builds which re-use previously downloaded dependencies, previously built artifacts, etc.

===== So why would you want to use this? There were a few goals for STI.

* Image flexibility: STI allows you to use almost any existing Docker image as the base for your application. STI scripts can be written to layer application code onto almost any existing Docker image, so you can take advantage of the existing ecosystem. (Why only “almost” all images? Currently STI relies on tar/untar to inject application source so the image needs to be able to process tarred content.)
* Speed: Adding layers as part of a Dockerfile can be slow. With STI the assemble process can perform a large number of complex operations without creating a new layer at each step. In addition, STI scripts can be written to re-use dependencies stored in a previous version of the application image rather than re-downloading them each time the build is run.
* Patchability: If an underlying image needs to be patched due to a security issue, OpenShift can use STI to rebuild your application on top of the patched builder image.
* Operational efficiency: By restricting build operations instead of allowing arbitrary actions such as in a Dockerfile, the PaaS operator can avoid accidental or intentional abuses of the build system.
* Operational security: Allowing users to build arbitrary Dockerfiles exposes the host system to root privilege escalation by a malicious user because the entire docker build process is run as a user with docker privileges. STI restricts the operations performed as a root user, and can run the scripts as an individual user
* User efficiency: STI prevents developers from falling into a trap of performing arbitrary “yum install” type operations during their application build, which would result in slow development iteration.
* Ecosystem: Encourages a shared ecosystem of images with best practices you can leverage for your applications.

==== Custom build
The custom build strategy is very similar to *Docker build* strategy, but users might customize the builder image that will be used for build execution. The Docker build uses https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/openshift/docker-builder/[openshift/docker-builder] image by default. Using your own builder image allows you to customize your build process.

== BuildLog
A buildlog is a model object that stores the logs of a particular build for later inspection.

== Deployment
A deployment is a specially annotated replication controller, specifying the desired configuration of that controller. See the http://docs.openshift.org/latest/using_openshift/deployments.html[deployment documentation] for more information.

== DeploymentConfig
A DeploymentConfig specifies an existing deployment, the triggers that can result in replacing the deployment with a new one, the strategy for doing so, and the history of such changes. See the http://docs.openshift.org/latest/using_openshift/deployments.html[deployment documentation] for more information.

== Image
OpenShift stores information about Docker images including the "pull spec" (what you'd use to pull the image) and complete metadata about the image (e.g. command, entrypoint, environment variables, etc.). Images in OpenShift are immutable.

}
----

Each container in a pod has a Docker image. Once you have created an image and pushed it to your registry, you can then refer to it in the Kubernetes pod.

The kubelet pulls the image from a specified repository. However, if the `imagePullPolicy` parameter is set to `PullIfNotPresent` or `PullNever` then the image is pulled from a local repository instead. This can be used to load images quickly, or as an alternative to loading a private registry. 

== ImageRepository
An ImageRepository is a representation of a stream of related images. Other OpenShift components such as builds and deployments can watch an ImageRepository to be notified when new images are added and react accordingly (perform a new build and/or deployment).

Sample image repository:
----
{
    "kind": "ImageRepository",
    "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "origin-ruby-sample",
        "namespace": "test",
        "selfLink": "/osapi/v1beta1/imageRepositories/origin-ruby-sample?namespace=test",
        "uid": "04e7133e-a349-11e4-bead-001c42c44ee1",
        "resourceVersion": "108",
        "creationTimestamp": "2015-01-23T16:44:33-05:00",
        "labels": {
            "template": "ruby-helloworld-sample"
        }
    },
    "tags": {
        "latest": "a2f15cc10423c165ca221f4a7beb1f2949fb0f5acbbc8e3a0250eb7d5593ae64"
    },
    "status": {
        "dockerImageRepository": "172.30.17.3:5001/test/origin-ruby-sample"
    }
}
----

== ImageRepositoryMapping
When the integrated OpenShift Docker registry receives a new image, it sends a notification to OpenShift via the ImageRepositoryMapping route. The registry informs OpenShift of the image's namespace, name, tag, and Docker metadata. OpenShift uses this information to create a new OpenShift Image and to update the appropriate ImageRepository with the mapping between the image's tag and the image itself.

Sample ImageRepositoryMapping:

    "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
    "dockerImageRepository": "172.30.17.3:5001/test/origin-ruby-sample",

----

== ImageRepositoryTag
ImageRepositoryTag is a convenience route used to retrieve an Image for a given ImageRepository and Tag.

== Template
A template describes a set of resources intended to be used together that can be customized and processed to produce a configuration. Each template can define a list of parameters that can be modified for consumption by containers.

Sample Template:

----
{
  "kind": "Template",
  "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "REDIS_PASSWORD",
      "description": "Password used for Redis authentication",
      "generate": "expression",
      "from": "[A-Z0-9]{8}"
    },
  ],
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "redis-master",
      "kind": "Pod",
      "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
      "labels": {"name": "redis-master"},
      "desiredState": {
        "manifest": {
          "version": "v1beta1",
          "name": "redis-master",
          "containers": [{
            "name": "master",
            "image": "dockerfile/redis",
            "env": [
              {
                "name": "REDIS_PASSWORD",
                "value": "${REDIS_PASSWORD}"
              }
            ],
            "ports": [{
              "containerPort": 6379
            }]
          }]
        }
      }
    },
  ]
}
}
----

== Route
An OpenShift route is a way to announce your service to the world. A route, consumed by a router in conjunction with service endpoints, provides named connectivity from external sources to your applications. Each route provides a name, service selector, and optionally security configuration.

Sample Route:

----
{
    "kind": "Route",
    "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "route-unsecure"
    },
    "id": "route-unsecure",
    "host": "www.example.com",
    "serviceName": "hello-nginx"
}
----

== Project
An OpenShift-level grouping of pod deployments and their attending resources. Can be used for identifying the components of an application and authorizing any collaboration.

== User
A user identity that may be authenticated and authorized for a set of capabilities. Can correspond to an actual person or a service account. See the https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/proposals/capabilities.md[capabilities proposal] for more context around the user and access model.

== OAuth
