== Overview
OpenShift extends the base Kubernetes model to provide a more feature rich development lifecycle platform.

=== Build Strategies
The OpenShift build system provides extensible support for build strategies based on selectable types specified in the build API. By default, two strategies are supported: Docker builds, and Source-to-Image builds.

==== Docker build
OpenShift supports pure Docker builds. Using this strategy, users may supply a URL to a Docker context which is used as the basis for a https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#build[Docker build].

==== Source-to-Image
Source-to-image (sti) is a tool for building reproducible Docker images. It produces ready-to-run images by injecting a user source into a docker image and assembling a new Docker image which incorporates the base image and built source, and is ready to use with `docker run`. STI supports incremental builds which re-use previously downloaded dependencies, previously built artifacts, etc.

===== So why would you want to use this? There were a few goals for STI.

* Image flexibility: STI allows you to use almost any existing Docker image as the base for your application. STI scripts can be written to layer application code onto almost any existing Docker image, so you can take advantage of the existing ecosystem. (Why only “almost” all images? Currently STI relies on tar/untar to inject application source so the image needs to be able to process tarred content.)
* Speed: Adding layers as part of a Dockerfile can be slow. With STI the assemble process can perform a large number of complex operations without creating a new layer at each step. In addition, STI scripts can be written to re-use dependencies stored in a previous version of the application image rather than re-downloading them each time the build is run.
* Patchability: If an underlying image needs to be patched due to a security issue, OpenShift can use STI to rebuild your application on top of the patched builder image.
* Operational efficiency: By restricting build operations instead of allowing arbitrary actions such as in a Dockerfile, the PaaS operator can avoid accidental or intentional abuses of the build system.
* Operational security: Allowing users to build arbitrary Dockerfiles exposes the host system to root privilege escalation by a malicious user because the entire docker build process is run as a user with docker privileges. STI restricts the operations performed as a root user, and can run the scripts as an individual user
* User efficiency: STI prevents developers from falling into a trap of performing arbitrary “yum install” type operations during their application build, which would result in slow development iteration.
* Ecosystem: Encourages a shared ecosystem of images with best practices you can leverage for your applications.

==== Custom build
The custom build strategy is very similar to *Docker build* strategy, but users might customize the builder image that will be used for build execution. The Docker build uses https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/openshift/docker-builder/[openshift/docker-builder] image by default. Using your own builder image allows you to customize your build process.

== Image

Each container in a pod has a Docker image. Once you have created an image and pushed it to your registry, you can then refer to it in the Kubernetes pod.

The kubelet will pull the image from a specified repository. However, if the `imagePullPolicy` parameter is set to `PullIfNotPresent` or `PullNever` then the image is pulled from a local repository instead. This can be used to load images quickly, or as an alternative to loading a private registry.
