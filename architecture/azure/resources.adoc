There are several Azure resources that are used to build clusters.

[[virtual-machine-scale-sets]]
== Virtual machine scale sets

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===

| Resource Type | Description

| `ss-masters`
a| A scale set of three virtual machines that help run core Services.

Some of the core Services that run on this set:

* An etcd daemon
* The {product-title} API server
* The {product-title} controller

The {product-title} (ARO) sync Pod also runs on one of the master virtual
machines.

| `ss-infra-TIMESTAMP`
a| A scale set of three virtual machines that help run infrastructure Pods.

Some of the Services that run on this scale set:

* The Docker registry
* Routers for applications that run on {product-title}
* The {product-title} web console
* The template service broker
* Prometheus cluster monitoring, which is used by ARO site reliability engineers to monitor cluster health

| `ss-compute-TIMESTAMP`
| A scale set of virtual machines that customers' Pods leverage. All customer
application and build Pods are scheduled on nodes within this scale set.
The customer can adjust the number of virtual machines.

|===

[[disks]]
== Disks
All `kubernetes-dynamic-pvc-*` disks are attached to their respective
virtual machines for Azure-disk-class persistent volumes (PVs).

[NOTE]
====
Persistent volumes are not backed up or replicated. You cannot use them for long-term storage.
====

[[public-ips]]
== Public IP addresses

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===

| Resource Type | Description

| `ip-apiserver`
| OpenShift API and web console access. This address points to `lb-apiserver`.
Name resolution is described in xref:#dns-configuration[DNS configuration].

| `ip-outbound`
| Resource for outbound traffic from customers' and infrastructure Pods.
This is configured in the `kubernetes` load balancer.

| `kubernetes-*`
| Resource for inbound traffic to applications that run in the customers' namespace.
This is configured in the `kubernetes` load balancer.

|===

[[load-balancers]]
== Load Balancers

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===

| Resource Type | Description

| `lb-apiserver`
| See xref:#public-ips[Public IP addresses].

| `kubernetes`
a| For all other traffic that `lb-apiserver` does not handle:

* Connections inbound to customers' Services that run on the cluster
* Connections outbound from customers' Pods

|===

[[network-security-groups]]
== Network security groups

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===

| Resource Type | Description

| `nsg-master`
| Applies to master nodes. This permits API access and SSH management access
by ARO back-end management systems.

| `nsg-worker`
| Applies to infrastructure and compute nodes. This permits access to the
Services that the `kubernetes` load balancer exposes.

|===

[[dns-configuration]]
== DNS configuration

Two DNS zones jointly compose a DNS configuration.

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===

| Resource Type | Description

| `openshift.ID.REGION.azmosa.io`
| A DNS name that provides API and web console access from the `ip-apiserver` IP
 address.

| `*.apps.ID.REGION.azmosa.io`
| An alias that, from CNAME, points to the `kubernetes-*` IP address for
inbound requests to customers' Services.

|===

[[key-vault]]
== Key vault

The key vault `kv-*` stores the cluster's keys and certificates.

[[storage-accounts]]
== Storage accounts

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===

| Resource Type | Description

| `sacfg`
| The account that begins with `sacfg` stores the master node startup config,
scale set hashes, and etcd backups.

| `sareg`
| Docker registry storage for customers' applications.

| `safil`
| Data storage for Azure-file storage-class PVs.

|===

[[pods]]
== Pods

A number of management Pods run in ARO clusters.

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===

| Resource Type | Description

| Sync Pod
| The sync Pod runs on a single master node. Its deployment settings
ensure that one instance runs at all times. The sync Pod's role guarantees that
managed OpenShift resources are synchronized with the desired values.

| Customer admin controller
| This controller synchronizes the contents of the designated Azure Active
Directory group to the cluster's RBAC customer-admin group. It also ensures
that required RBAC roles are granted in customer-created namespaces.

| Monitoring related
| A cluster monitoring Prometheus instance gathers monitoring data for {product-title}
site reliability engineering teams. Customers cannot access this instance.
Customers can link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/insights/container-insights-azure-redhat-setup[configure clusters with Azure Monitor for containers]
to get extensive telemetry and container logs.
