== Overview
The authentication layer identifies the user associated with requests to the
{product-title} API. The authorization layer then uses information about the
requesting user to determine if the request should be allowed.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
As an administrator, you can
xref:../../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#install-config-configuring-authentication[configure authentication]
using a xref:../../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#install-config-master-node-configuration[master
configuration file].
endif::[]

[[users-and-groups]]

== Users and Groups

A _user_ in {product-title} is an entity that can make requests to the
{product-title} API. Typically, this represents the account of a developer or
administrator that is interacting with {product-title}.

A user can be assigned to one or more _groups_, each of which represent a
certain set of users. Groups are useful when
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
xref:../../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.adoc#admin-guide-manage-authorization-policy[managing authorization
policies]
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
managing authorization policies
endif::[]
to grant permissions to multiple users at once, for example allowing
access to xref:../core_concepts/index.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-index[objects] within a
xref:../core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#projects[project], versus granting
them to users individually.

In addition to explicitly defined groups, there are also
system groups, or _virtual groups_, that are automatically provisioned by
OpenShift.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
These can be seen when
xref:../../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.adoc#viewing-cluster-bindings[viewing
cluster bindings].
endif::[]

In the default set of virtual groups, note the following in
particular:

[cols="2,5",options="header"]
|===

|Virtual Group |Description

|*system:authenticated* |Automatically associated with all authenticated users.
|*system:authenticated:oauth* |Automatically associated with all users authenticated with an OAuth access token.
|*system:unauthenticated* |Automatically associated with all unauthenticated users.

|===

[[api-authentication]]

== API Authentication
Requests to the {product-title} API are authenticated using the following
methods:

OAuth Access Tokens::
- Obtained from the {product-title} OAuth server using the `_<master>_/oauth/authorize` and `_<master>_/oauth/token` endpoints.
- Sent as an `Authorization: Bearer...` header or an `access_token=...` query parameter

X.509 Client Certificates::
* Requires a HTTPS connection to the API server.
* Verified by the API server against a trusted certificate authority bundle.
* The API server creates and distributes certificates to controllers to authenticate themselves.

Any request with an invalid access token or an invalid certificate is rejected
by the authentication layer with a 401 error.

If no access token or certificate is presented, the authentication layer assigns
the `system:anonymous` virtual user and the `system:unauthenticated` virtual
group to the request. This allows the authorization layer to determine which
requests, if any, an anonymous user is allowed to make.

See the xref:../../rest_api/index.adoc#rest-api-index[REST API Overview] for more information
and examples.

[[authentication-impersonation]]
=== Impersonation
A request to the {product-title} API may include an *Impersonate-User* header,
which indicates that the requester wants to have the request handled as though
it came from the specified user. This can be done on the command line by passing
the `*--as=username*` flag.

Before User A is allowed to impersonate User B, User A is first authenticated.
Then, an authorization check occurs to ensure that User A is allowed to
impersonate the user named User B. If User A is requesting to impersonate a
service account (*system:serviceaccount:namespace:name*), {product-title} checks
to ensure that User A can impersonate the *serviceaccount* named *name* in
*namespace*. If the check fails, the request fails with a 403 (Forbidden) error
code.

By default, project administrators and editors are allowed to impersonate
service accounts in their namespace. The *sudoers* role allows a user to
impersonate *system:admin*, which in turn has cluster administrator permissions.
This grants some protection against typos (but not security) for someone
administering the cluster. For example, `oc delete nodes --all` would be
forbidden, but `oc delete nodes --all --as=system:admin` would be allowed. You
can add a user to that group using `oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user sudoer
<username>`.

[[oauth]]

== OAuth
The {product-title} master includes a built-in OAuth server. Users obtain OAuth
access tokens to authenticate themselves to the API.

When a person requests a new OAuth token, the OAuth server uses the configured
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
xref:../../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#install-config-configuring-authentication[identity
provider]
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
identity provider
endif::[]
to determine the identity of the person making the request.

It then determines what user that identity maps to, creates an access token for
that user, and returns the token for use.

[[oauth-clients]]
*OAuth Clients*

Every request for an OAuth token must specify the OAuth client that will
receive and use the token. The following OAuth clients are automatically created
when starting the {product-title} API:

[options="header"]
|===

|OAuth Client |Usage

|*openshift-web-console*
|Requests tokens for the web console.

|*openshift-browser-client*
|Requests tokens at `_<master>_/oauth/token/request` with a user-agent that can handle interactive logins.

|*openshift-challenging-client*
|Requests tokens with a user-agent that can handle `WWW-Authenticate` challenges.

|===

To register additional clients:

====

----
$ oc create -f <(echo '
kind: OAuthClient
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
 name: demo <1>
secret: "..." <2>
redirectURIs:
 - "http://www.example.com/" <3>
grantMethod: prompt <4>
')
----
<1> The `name` of the OAuth client is used as the `client_id` parameter when making requests to `_<master>_/oauth/authorize` and `_<master>_/oauth/token`.
<2> The `secret` is used as the `client_secret` parameter when making requests to `_<master>_/oauth/token`.
<3> The `redirect_uri` parameter specified in requests to `_<master>_/oauth/authorize` and `_<master>_/oauth/token` must be equal to (or prefixed by) one of the URIs in `redirectURIs`.
<4> The `grantMethod` is used to determine what action to take when this client requests tokens and has not yet been granted access by the user. Uses the same values seen in xref:../../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#grant-options[Grant Options].
====

[[service-accounts-as-oauth-clients]]
*Service Accounts as OAuth Clients*

A
xref:../../admin_guide/service_accounts.adoc#admin-guide-service-accounts[service
account] can be used as a constrained form of OAuth client. Service accounts can
only request a subset of
xref:../../admin_guide/scoped_tokens.adoc#admin-guide-scoped-tokens[scopes] that
allow access to some basic user information and role-based power inside of the
service account's own namespace:

* `user:info`
* `user:check-access`
* `role:<any role>:<serviceaccount namespace>`
* `role:<any role>:<serviceaccount namespace>:!`

When using a service account as an OAuth client:

* `client_id` is `system:serviceaccount:<serviceaccount namespace>:<serviceaccount name>`.
* `client_secret` can be any of the API tokens for that service account. For example:
+
----
$ oc sa get-token <serviceaccount name>
----

* `redirect_uri` must match an annotation on the service account that has the
prefix `serviceaccounts.openshift.io/oauth-redirecturi`. For example,
`serviceaccounts.openshift.io/oauth-redirecturi.one`.
* To get `WWW-Authenticate` challenges, set an
`serviceaccounts.openshift.io/oauth-want-challenges` annotation on the service
account to *true*.

[[integrations]]
*Integrations*

All requests for OAuth tokens involve a request to `_<master>_/oauth/authorize`.
Most authentication integrations place an authenticating proxy in front of this
endpoint, or configure {product-title} to validate credentials against a backing
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
xref:../../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#install-config-configuring-authentication[identity
provider].
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
identity provider.
endif::[]
Requests to `_<master>_/oauth/authorize` can come from user-agents that cannot
display interactive login pages, such as the CLI. Therefore, {product-title}
supports authenticating using a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge in addition to
interactive login flows.

If an authenticating proxy is placed in front of the
`_<master>_/oauth/authorize` endpoint, it should send unauthenticated,
non-browser user-agents `WWW-Authenticate` challenges, rather than displaying an
interactive login page or redirecting to an interactive login flow.

[NOTE]
====
To prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks against browser clients, Basic authentication challenges
should only be sent if a `X-CSRF-Token` header is present on the request. Clients that expect
to receive Basic `WWW-Authenticate` challenges should set this header to a non-empty value.

If the authenticating proxy cannot support `WWW-Authenticate` challenges, or if
{product-title} is configured to use an identity provider that does not support
WWW-Authenticate challenges, users can visit `_<master>_/oauth/token/request`
using a browser to obtain an access token manually.
====

[[obtaining-oauth-tokens]]
*Obtaining OAuth Tokens*

The OAuth server supports standard
link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1[authorization code grant]
and the link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.2[implicit grant]
OAuth authorization flows.

When requesting an OAuth token using the implicit grant flow
(`response_type=token`) with a client_id configured to request `WWW-Authenticate
challenges` (like `openshift-challenging-client`), these are the possible server
responses from `/oauth/authorize`, and how they should be handled:
