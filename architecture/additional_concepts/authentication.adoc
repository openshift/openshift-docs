== Overview
The authentication layer identifies the user associated with requests to the
OpenShift API. The authorization layer then uses information about the
requesting user to determine if the request should be allowed.

As an administrator, you can
link:../../admin_guide/configuring_authentication.html[configure authentication]
using a link:../../admin_guide/master_node_configuration.html[master
configuration file].

[[users-and-groups]]

== Users and Groups

A _user_ in OpenShift is an entity that can make requests to the OpenShift API.
Typically, this represents the account of a developer or administrator that is
interacting with OpenShift.

A user can be assigned to one or more _groups_, each of which represent a
certain set of users. Groups are useful when
link:../../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.html[managing authorization
policies] to grant permissions to multiple users at once, for example allowing
access to link:../core_concepts/overview.html[objects] within a
link:../core_concepts/projects_and_users.html#projects[project], versus granting
them to users individually.

Support for developers and administrators to define their own custom groups is
currently under active development. At this time, the only groups that exist are
system groups, or _virtual groups_, that are automatically provisioned by
OpenShift. These can be seen when
link:../../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.html#viewing-cluster-bindings[viewing
cluster bindings].

In the default set of virtual groups, note the following in
particular:

[cols="2,5",options="header"]
|===

|Virtual Group |Description

|*system:authenticated* |Automatically associated with any currently-authenticated users.
|*system:unauthenticated* |Automatically associated with any currently-unauthenticated users.

[[api-authentication]]

== API Authentication
Requests to the OpenShift API are authenticated using the following methods:

OAuth Access Tokens::
- Obtained from the OpenShift OAuth server using the `_<master>_/oauth/authorize` and `_<master>_/oauth/token` endpoints.
- Sent as an `Authorization: Bearer+++...+++` header or an `access_token=+++...+++` query parameter

X.509 Client Certificates::
* Requires a HTTPS connection to the API server.
* Verified by the API server against a trusted certificate authority bundle.
* The API server creates and distributes certificates to controllers to authenticate themselves.

Any request with an invalid access token or an invalid certificate is rejected
by the authentication layer with a 401 error.

If no access token or certificate is presented, the authentication layer assigns
the `system:anonymous` virtual user and the `system:unauthenticated` virtual
group to the request. This allows the authorization layer to determine which
requests, if any, an anonymous user is allowed to make.

[[oauth]]

== OAuth
The OpenShift master includes a built-in OAuth server. Users obtain OAuth
access tokens to authenticate themselves to the API.

When a person requests a new OAuth token, the OAuth server uses the configured
link:../../admin_guide/configuring_authentication.html[identity
provider] to determine the identity of the person making the request.

It then determines what user that identity maps to, creates an access token for
that user, and returns the token for use.

*OAuth Clients* [[oauth-clients]]

Every request for an OAuth token must specify the OAuth client that will
receive and use the token. The following OAuth clients are automatically created
when starting the OpenShift API:

[options="header"]
|===

|OAuth Client |Usage

|*openshift-web-console*
|Requests tokens for the web console.

|*openshift-browser-client*
|Requests tokens at `_<master>_/oauth/token/request` with a user-agent that can handle interactive logins.

|*openshift-challenging-client*
|Requests tokens with a user-agent that can handle `WWW-Authenticate` challenges.

|===

To register additional clients:

====

----
$ oc create -f <(echo '
{
  "kind": "OAuthClient",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "demo" <1>
  },
  "secret": "...", <2>
  "redirectURIs": [
    "http://www.example.com/" <3>
  ]
}')
----
<1> The `name` of the OAuth client is used as the `client_id` parameter when making requests to `_<master>_/oauth/authorize` and `_<master>_/oauth/token`.
<2> The `secret` is used as the `client_secret` parameter when making requests to `_<master>_/oauth/token`.
<3> The `redirect_uri` parameter specified in requests to `_<master>_/oauth/authorize` and `_<master>_/oauth/token` must be equal to (or prefixed by) one of the URIs in `redirectURIs`.
====

*Integrations* [[integrations]]

All requests for OAuth tokens involve a request to `_<master>_/oauth/authorize`.
Most authentication integrations place an authenticating proxy in front of this
endpoint, or configure OpenShift to validate credentials against a backing
link:../../admin_guide/configuring_authentication.html[identity provider].

Requests to `_<master>_/oauth/authorize` can come from user-agents that cannot
display interactive login pages, such as the CLI. Therefore, OpenShift supports
authenticating using a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge in addition to interactive
login flows.

If an authenticating proxy is placed in front of the
`_<master>_/oauth/authorize` endpoint, it should send unauthenticated,
non-browser user-agents `WWW-Authenticate` challenges, rather than displaying an
interactive login page or redirecting to an interactive login flow.

[NOTE]
====
To prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks against browser clients, Basic authentication challenges
should only be sent if a `X-CSRF-Token` header is present on the request. Clients that expect
to receive Basic `WWW-Authenticate` challenges should set this header to a non-empty value.

If the authenticating proxy cannot support `WWW-Authenticate` challenges, or if
OpenShift is configured to use an
link:../../admin_guide/configuring_authentication.html[identity provider] that
does not support WWW-Authenticate challenges, users can visit
`_<master>_/oauth/token/request` using a browser to obtain an access token
manually.
