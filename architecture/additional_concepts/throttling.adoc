== Overview

OpenShift clusters will orchestrate many potentially large applications that could be co-located on
a set of shared nodes.  Throttling refers to the act of controlling pod start order and resource
consumption to provide:

1. Optimal start-up time when the system has to start large numbers of pods at once
2. Resource control so that a single container cannot monopolize the resources of an entire node
