== Overview

{product-title} uses a software-defined networking (SDN) approach to provide a unified
cluster network that enables communication between pods across the {product-title}
cluster. This pod network is established and maintained by the OpenShift SDN,
which configures an overlay network using Open vSwitch (OVS).

OpenShift SDN provides three SDN plug-ins for configuring the pod network:

* The *ovs-subnet* plug-in is the original plug-in which provides a "flat" pod
network where every pod can communicate with every other pod and service.
* The *ovs-multitenant* plug-in provides {product-title} project level isolation for
pods and services. Each project receives a unique Virtual Network ID (VNID)
that identifies traffic from pods assigned to the project. Pods from different
projects cannot send packets to or receive packets from pods and services of a
different project.
+
However, projects which receive VNID 0 are more privileged in that they are
allowed to communicate with all other pods, and all other pods can communicate
with them. In {product-title} clusters, the *default* project has VNID 0. This
facilitates certain services like the load balancer, etc. to communicate with
all other pods in the cluster and vice versa.
* The *ovs-networkpolicy* plug-in allows project
administrators to configure their own isolation policies using
xref:../../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#admin-guide-networking-networkpolicy[NetworkPolicy objects].

Following is a detailed discussion of the design and operation of
OpenShift SDN, which may be useful for troubleshooting.

[[sdn-design-on-masters]]
== Design on Masters

On an {product-title} master, OpenShift SDN maintains a registry of nodes,
stored in *etcd*. When the system administrator registers a node,
OpenShift SDN allocates an unused subnet from the cluster network and
stores this subnet in the registry. When a node is deleted, OpenShift SDN
deletes the subnet from the registry and considers the subnet available to be
allocated again.

In the default configuration, the cluster network is the *10.128.0.0/14* network
(i.e. *10.128.0.0* - *10.131.255.255*), and nodes are allocated */23* subnets
(i.e., *10.128.0.0/23*, *10.128.2.0/23*, *10.128.4.0/23*, and so on). This means
that the cluster network has 512 subnets available to assign to nodes, and a
given node is allocated 510 addresses that it can assign to the containers
running on it. The size and address range of the cluster network are
configurable, as is the host subnet size.

[OpenShift SDN]
====
In order to make it easeier for humans to follow if a subnet extends into the next higher octet,
we rotate the bits of the subnet number so subnets with all 0s in the shared octet are allocated
first. So if the given network is "10.1.0.0/16" hostsubnetlength=6 then 10.1.0.0/26, 10.1.1.0/26,
through 10.1.255.0/26 are allocated before the system fills in the gaps with 10.1.0.64/26,
10.1.1.64/26, etc.
====

Note that OpenShift SDN on a master does not configure the local (master)
host to have access to any cluster network. Consequently, a master host does not
have access to pods via the cluster network, unless it is also running as a
node.

When using the *ovs-multitenant* plug-in, the OpenShift SDN master also
watches for the creation and deletion of projects, and assigns VXLAN VNIDs to
them, which will be used later by the nodes to isolate traffic correctly.

[[sdn-design-on-nodes]]
== Design on Nodes

On a node, OpenShift SDN first registers the local host with the SDN
master in the aforementioned registry so that the master allocates a subnet to
the node.

Next, OpenShift SDN creates and configures three network devices:

* *br0*, the OVS bridge device that pod containers will be attached to.
OpenShift SDN also configures a set of non-subnet-specific flow rules on this
bridge.
* *tun0*, an OVS internal port (port 2 on *br0*). This gets assigned the
cluster subnet gateway address, and is used for external network
access. OpenShift SDN configures *netfilter* and routing rules to enable access
from the cluster subnet to the external network via NAT.
* `vxlan_sys_4789`: The OVS VXLAN device (port 1 on `br0`), which provides access to containers on remote nodes. Referred to as `vxlan0` in the OVS rules.

Each time a pod is started on the host, OpenShift SDN:

. assigns the pod a free IP address from the node's cluster subnet.
. attaches the host side of the pod's veth interface pair to the OVS bridge *br0*.
. adds OpenFlow rules to the OVS database to route traffic addressed to the new
pod to the correct OVS port.
. in the case of the *ovs-multitenant* plug-in, adds OpenFlow rules to tag
traffic coming from the pod with the pod's VNID, and to allow traffic into the
pod if the traffic's VNID matches the pod's VNID (or is the privileged VNID 0).
Non-matching traffic is filtered out by a generic rule.

OpenShift SDN nodes also watch for subnet updates from the SDN master. When a
new subnet is added, the node adds OpenFlow rules on *br0* so that packets with
a destination IP address the remote subnet go to *vxlan0* (port 1 on *br0*) and
thus out onto the network. The *ovs-subnet* plug-in sends all packets across the
VXLAN with VNID 0, but the *ovs-multitenant* plug-in uses the appropriate VNID
for the source container.

[[sdn-packet-flow]]
== Packet Flow

Suppose you have two containers, A and B, where the peer virtual Ethernet device
for container A's *eth0* is named *vethA* and the peer for container B's *eth0*
is named *vethB*.

[NOTE]
====
If the Docker service's use of peer virtual Ethernet devices is not already familiar to you,
review https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/dockernetworks/[Docker's advanced networking
documentation].
====

Now suppose first that container A is on the local host and container B is also
on the local host. Then the flow of packets from container A to container B is
as follows:

*_eth0_* _(in A's netns) -> *vethA* -> *br0* -> *vethB* -> *eth0* (in B's netns)_

Next, suppose instead that container A is on the local host and container B is
on a remote host on the cluster network. Then the flow of packets from container
A to container B is as follows:

*_eth0_* _(in A's netns) -> *vethA* -> *br0* -> *vxlan0* ->
network footnote:[After this point, device names refer to devices on container
B's host.] -> *vxlan0* -> *br0* -> *vethB* -> *eth0* (in B's netns)_

Finally, if container A connects to an external host, the traffic looks like:

*_eth0_* _(in A's netns) -> *vethA* -> *br0* -> *tun0* -> (NAT) -> *eth0* (physical device) -> Internet_

Almost all packet delivery decisions are performed with OpenFlow rules in the
OVS bridge *br0*, which simplifies the plug-in network architecture and provides
flexible routing. In the case of the *ovs-multitenant* plug-in, this also
provides enforceable xref:network-isolation-multitenant[network isolation].

[[network-isolation-multitenant]]
== Network Isolation

You can use the *ovs-multitenant* plug-in to achieve network isolation. When a
packet exits a pod assigned to a non-default project, the OVS bridge *br0* tags
that packet with the project's assigned VNID. If the packet is directed to
another IP address in the node's cluster subnet, the OVS bridge only allows the
packet to be delivered to the destination pod if the VNIDs match.

If a packet is received from another node via the VXLAN tunnel, the Tunnel ID
is used as the VNID, and the OVS bridge only allows the packet to be delivered
to a local pod if the tunnel ID matches the destination pod's VNID.

Packets destined for other cluster subnets are tagged with their VNID and
delivered to the VXLAN tunnel with a tunnel destination address of the node
owning the cluster subnet.

As described before, VNID 0 is privileged in that traffic with any VNID is
allowed to enter any pod assigned VNID 0, and traffic with VNID 0 is allowed to
enter any pod. Only the *default* {product-title} project is assigned VNID 0;
all other projects are assigned unique, isolation-enabled VNIDs. Cluster
