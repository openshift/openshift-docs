== Overview

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
[NOTE]
====
This topic applies only if the ephemeral storage technology preview is enabled. This feature is disabled by default. If enabled, the {product-title} cluster uses ephemeral storage to store information that does not need to persist after the cluster is destroyed. To enable this feature, see
xref:../../install_config/configuring_ephemeral.adoc#install-config-configuring-ephemeral-storage[configuring for ephemeral storage].

In addition to persistent storage, pods and containers may require
ephemeral or transient local storage for their operation. The lifetime
of this ephemeral storage does not extend beyond the life of the
individual pod, and this ephemeral storage cannot be shared across
pods.

Prior to {product-title} 3.10, ephemeral local storage was exposed to pods using
the container’s writable layer, logs directory, and EmptyDir volumes. Pods use
ephemeral local storage for scratch space, caching, and logs. Issues related to
the lack of local storage accounting and isolation include the following:

* Pods do not know how much local storage is available to them.
* Pods cannot request guaranteed local storage.
* Local storage is a best effort resource.
* Pods can be evicted due to other pods filling the local storage,
after which new pods are not admitted until sufficient storage
has been reclaimed.

Unlike persistent volumes, ephemeral storage is unstructured and
shared, the space, not the actual data, between all pods running on a
node, in addition to other uses by the system, the container runtime,
and {product-title}. The ephemeral storage framework allows pods to
specify their transient local storage needs, and {product-title} to
schedule pods where appropriate and protect the node against excessive
use of local storage.

While the ephemeral storage framework allows administrators and
developers to better manage this local storage, it does not provide
any promises related to I/O throughput and latency.

[[section-types-of-ephemeral-storage]]
== Types of ephemeral storage

Ephemeral local storage is always made available in the primary
partition. There are two basic ways of creating the primary
partition, root and runtime.

[[section-type-root]]
=== Root

This partition holds the kubelet’s root directory, `/var/lib/origin/` by
default, and `/var/log/` directory. This partition may be shared between user
pods, OS, and Kubernetes system daemons. This partition can be consumed by pods
via EmptyDir volumes, container logs, image layers, and container writable
layers. Kubelet manages shared access and isolation of this partition. This
partition is ephemeral, and applications cannot expect any performance SLAs,
disk IOPS for example, from this partition.

[[section-type-runtime]]
=== Runtime

This is an optional partition that runtimes can use for overlay
file systems. {product-title} attempts to identify and provide
shared access along with isolation to this partition. Container image
layers and writable layers are stored here. If the runtime partition
exists, the `root` partition does not hold any image layer or other writable storage.

[NOTE]
====
When you use DeviceMapper to provide runtime storage, a containers' copy-on-write layer is not accounted for in ephemeral storage management. Use overlay storage to monitor this ephemeral storage.

[[section-managing-ephemeral-storage]]
== Managing ephemeral storage

Cluster administrators can manage ephemeral storage within a project by xref:../../admin_guide/quota.html#overview[setting quotas] that define the limit ranges and number of requests for ephemeral storage across all Pods in a non-terminal state. Developers can also xref:../../dev_guide/compute_resources.html#dev-compute-resources[set requests and limits] on this compute resource at the Pod and Container level.

[[section-monitoring-ephemeral-storage]]
== Monitoring ephemeral storage

You can use `/bin/df` as a tool to monitor ephemeral storage usage on the volume where ephemeral container data is located, which is `/var/lib/origin` and `/var/lib/docker`. The available space for only `/var/lib/origin` is shown when you use the `df` command if `/var/lib/docker` is placed on a separate disk by the cluster administrator.

Use the `df -h` command to show the human-readable values of used and available space in `/var/lib`:

$ df -h /var/lib
