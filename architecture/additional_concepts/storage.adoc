== Overview

Managing storage is a distinct problem from managing compute resources.
{product-title} uses the Kubernetes persistent volume (PV) framework to allow
cluster administrators to provision persistent storage for a cluster. Developers
can use persistent volume claims (PVCs) to request PV resources without having
specific knowledge of the underlying storage infrastructure.

PVCs are specific to a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#projects[project]
and are created and used by developers as a means to use a PV. PV resources on
their own are not scoped to any single project; they can be shared across the
entire {product-title} cluster and claimed from any project. After a PV is
xref:binding[bound] to a PVC, however, that PV cannot then be bound to
additional PVCs. This has the effect of scoping a bound PV to a single
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#namespaces[namespace]
(that of the binding project).

PVs are defined by a `PersistentVolume` API object, which represents a piece of
existing, networked storage in the cluster that was provisioned by the
cluster administrator. It is a resource in the cluster just like a node is a
cluster resource. PVs are volume plug-ins like `Volumes` but have a lifecycle
that is independent of any individual
xref:../core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#pods[pod] that uses the PV. PV
objects capture the details of the implementation of the storage, be that NFS,
iSCSI, or a cloud-provider-specific storage system.

[IMPORTANT]
====
High availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.
====

PVCs are defined by a `PersistentVolumeClaim` API object, which represents a
request for storage by a developer. It is similar to a pod in that pods consume
node resources and PVCs consume PV resources. For example, pods can request
specific levels of resources (e.g., CPU and memory), while PVCs can request
specific xref:pv-capacity[storage capacity] and xref:pv-access-modes[access
modes] (e.g, they can be mounted once read/write or many times read-only).

[[lifecycle-of-a-volume-and-claim]]
== Lifecycle of a volume and claim

PVs are resources in the cluster. PVCs are requests for those resources and also
act as claim checks to the resource. The interaction between PVs and PVCs have
the following lifecycle.

[[provisioning]]
=== Provision storage

In response to requests from a developer defined in a PVC, a cluster
administrator configures one or more dynamic provisioners that provision storage
and a matching PV.

Alternatively, a cluster administrator can create a number of PVs in advance
that carry the details of the real storage that is available for use. PVs exist
in the API and are available for use.

[[binding]]
=== Bind claims

When you create a PVC, you request a specific amount of storage, specify the
required access mode, and create a storage class to describe and classify the
storage. The control loop in the master watches for new PVCs and binds the new
PVC to an appropriate PV. If an appropriate PV does not exist, a provisioner for
the storage class creates one.

The PV volume might exceed your requested volume. This is especially true with
manually provisioned PVs. To minimize the excess, {product-title} binds to the
smallest PV that matches all other criteria.

Claims remain unbound indefinitely if a matching volume does not exist or cannot
be created with any available provisioner servicing a storage class. Claims
are bound as matching volumes become available. For example, a cluster
with many manually provisioned 50Gi volumes would not match a PVC requesting
100Gi. The PVC can be bound when a 100Gi PV is added to the cluster.

[[using]]
=== Use pods and claimed PVs

Pods use claims as volumes. The cluster inspects the claim to find the bound
volume and mounts that volume for a pod. For those volumes that support multiple
access modes, you must specify which mode applies when you use the claim as
a volume in a pod.

After you have a claim and that claim is bound, the bound PV belongs to you
for as long as you need it. You can schedule pods and access claimed
PVs by including `persistentVolumeClaim` in the pod's volumes block. See
xref:pvc-claims-as-volumes[below] for syntax details.

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]

[[pvcprotection]]
=== PVC protection

PVC protection is enabled by default.

endif::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]

[[releasing]]
=== Release volumes

When you are finished with a volume, you can delete the PVC object from the API,
which allows reclamation of the resource. The volume is considered "released"
when the claim is deleted, but it is not yet available for another claim. The
previous claimant's data remains on the volume and must be handled according
to policy.

[[reclaiming]]
=== Reclaim volumes

The reclaim policy of a `PersistentVolume` tells the cluster what to do with
the volume after it is released. Volumes reclaim policy can either be `Retain` or `Delete`.

`Retain` reclaim policy allows manual reclamation of the resource for those volume plug-ins that support it. `Delete` reclaim policy deletes both the `PersistentVolume` object from {product-title} and the associated storage asset in external infrastructure, such as AWS EBS, GCE PD, or Cinder volume.

[NOTE]
====
Dynamically provisioned volumes have a default `ReclaimPolicy` value of `Delete`. Manually provisioned volumes have a default `ReclaimPolicy` value of `Retain`.
====

[[persistent-volumes]]
== Persistent volumes

Each PV contains a `spec` and `status`, which is the specification and
status of the volume, for example:

[[pv-capacity]]
=== Capacity

Generally, a PV has a specific storage capacity. This is set by using the PV's
`capacity` attribute.

Currently, storage capacity is the only resource that can be set or requested.
Future attributes may include IOPS, throughput, and so on.

[[pv-access-modes]]
=== Access modes

A `PersistentVolume` can be mounted on a host in any way supported by the
resource provider. Providers will have different capabilities and each PV's
access modes are set to the specific modes supported by that particular volume.
For example, NFS can support multiple read/write clients, but a specific NFS PV
might be exported on the server as read-only. Each PV gets its own set of access
modes describing that specific PV's capabilities.

Claims are matched to volumes with similar access modes. The only two matching
criteria are access modes and size. A claim's access modes represent a request.
Therefore, you might be granted more, but never less. For example, if a claim
requests RWO, but the only volume available is an NFS PV (RWO+ROX+RWX), the
claim would then match NFS because it supports RWO.

Direct matches are always attempted first. The volume's modes must match or
contain more modes than you requested. The size must be greater than or equal to
what is expected. If two types of volumes (NFS and iSCSI, for example) have
the same set of access modes, either of them can match a claim with those
modes. There is no ordering between types of volumes and no way to choose one
type over another.

All volumes with the same modes are grouped, and then sorted by size (smallest to
largest). The binder gets the group with matching modes and iterates over each
(in size order) until one size matches.

The following table lists the access modes:

.Access modes
[cols="1,1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Access Mode |CLI abbreviation |Description
|ReadWriteOnce
|`RWO`
|The volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node.
|ReadOnlyMany
|`ROX`
|The volume can be mounted read-only by many nodes.
|ReadWriteMany
|`RWX`
|The volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes.
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
A volume's `AccessModes` are descriptors of the volume's capabilities. They
are not enforced constraints. The storage provider is responsible for runtime
errors resulting from invalid use of the resource.

For example, Ceph offers *ReadWriteOnce* access mode. You must
mark the claims as `read-only` if you want to use the volume's
ROX capability. Errors in the provider show up at runtime as mount errors.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]

iSCSI and Fibre Channel volumes do not currently have any fencing mechanisms. You must
ensure the volumes are only used by one node at a time. In certain situations,
such as draining a node, the volumes can be used simultaneously by two nodes.
Before draining the node, first ensure the pods that use these volumes are
deleted.

ifdef::openshift-aro[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
Persistent volumes are backed by the following storage classes:

* azure-disk
* azure-file

Both of these storage technologies rely on the Azure storage infrastructure. The {product-title} Service does not back up persistent volumes and, therefore, recommends using external Services for storing sensitive data or application state.
====
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
 * Persistent volumes are provisioned with EBS volumes (AWS).
 * Only RWO access mode is applicable, as EBS volumes cannot be mounted to multiple nodes.
 * *emptyDir* has the same lifecycle as the pod:
   ** *emptyDir* volumes survive container crashes/restarts.
   ** *emptyDir* volumes are deleted when the pod is deleted.
====
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-online[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
 * Persistent volumes are provisioned with EBS volumes (AWS).
 * Only RWO access mode is applicable, as EBS volumes and GCE Persistent Disks cannot be mounted to multiple nodes.
 * Docker volumes are disabled.
   ** VOLUME directive without a mapped external volume fails to be instantiated.
 * *emptyDir* is restricted to 512 Mi per project (group) per node.
   ** A single pod for a project on a particular node can use up to 512 Mi of *emptyDir* storage.
   ** Multiple pods for a project on a particular node share the 512 Mi of *emptyDir* storage.
 *  *emptyDir* has the same lifecycle as the pod:
   ** *emptyDir* volumes survive container crashes/restarts.
   ** *emptyDir* volumes are deleted when the pod is deleted.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
[[pv-mount-options]]
=== Mount options

You can specify mount options while mounting a persistent volume by using the annotation `volume.beta.kubernetes.io/mount-options`.

For example:

.Mount options example
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv0001
  annotations:
    volume.beta.kubernetes.io/mount-options: rw,nfsvers=4,noexec <1>
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  nfs:
    path: /tmp
    server: 172.17.0.2
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  claimRef:
    name: claim1
    namespace: default
----
<1> Specified mount options are used while mounting the PV to the disk.

The following persistent volume types support mount options:

- NFS
- GlusterFS
- Ceph RBD
- OpenStack Cinder
- AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS)
- GCE Persistent Disk
- iSCSI
- Azure Disk
- Azure File
- VMWare vSphere

[NOTE]
====
Fibre Channel and HostPath persistent volumes do not support mount options.
====
endif::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]

[[persistent-volume-claims]]
== Persistent volume claims

Each PVC contains a `spec` and `status`, which is the specification and
status of the claim, for example:

.PVC object definition example
[source,yaml]
----
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: myclaim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 8Gi
  storageClassName: gold

----

[[pvc-storage-class]]
=== Storage classes

Claims can optionally request a specific storage class by specifying the storage
class's name in the `storageClassName` attribute. Only PVs of the requested
class, ones with the same `storageClassName` as the PVC, can be bound to the
PVC. The cluster administrator can configure dynamic provisioners to service one
or more storage classes. The cluster administrator can create a PV on demand
that matches the specifications in the PVC.

The cluster administrator can also set a default storage class for all PVCs.
When a default storage class is configured, the PVC must explicitly ask for
`StorageClass` or `storageClassName` annotations set to `""` to be bound to a
PV without a storage class.

[[pvc-access-modes]]
=== Access modes

Claims use the same conventions as volumes when requesting storage with specific
access modes.

[[pvc-resources]]
=== Resources

Claims, such as pods, can request specific quantities of a resource. In this case,
the request is for storage. The same resource model applies to volumes and claims.

[[pvc-claims-as-volumes]]
=== Claims as volumes

Pods access storage by using the claim as a volume. Claims must exist in the
same namespace as the pod by using the claim. The cluster finds the claim in the
pod's namespace and uses it to get the `PersistentVolume` backing the claim.
The volume is mounted to the host and into the pod, for example:

.Mount volume to the host and into the pod example
[source,yaml]
----
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myfrontend

A multi-AZ {product-title} cluster comes configured with one storage class per

[[osd-multi-az-pv-usecases]]
=== Use cases

[[osd-multi-az-pv-usecases-pvc-storageclass-cli]]
==== Creating a PersistentVolumeClaim with a specific storage class (CLI)

Creating a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) via the CLI requires a manifest file that
provides the name and details of the PersistentVolume (PV) being requested.
To have the PVC use a different storage class, simply indicate that in your
manifest.

.PVC example
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mypvc
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
  requests:
    storage: 1Gi
  storageClassName: gp2-encrypted-us-east-2b <1>
----
<1> Specify your storage class to override the default.

Passing this manifest to `oc create -f <manifest filename>` creates a PV in
the AZ of the storage class provided. You can confirm this by checking the
output of `oc get pvc`.

[[osd-multi-az-pv-usecases-pvc-storageclass-ui]]
==== Creating a PersistentVolumeClaim with a specific storage class (UI)

To choose a storage class for your PVC using the web console, navigate to the
Storage dashboard and click the "Create Storage" button. The first option on the
"Create Storage" page is a dropdown list of available storage classes.

image::storage-class.png[Create storage with UI,title="Storage Class dropdown"]

The drop-down menu shows the name, zone, and access mode for the available
storage classes. You can select your desired storage class, provide a name and
size for the PVC, and click *Create*.

[[osd-multi-az-pv-usecases-pvc-non-default-storageclass-cli]]
==== Using non-default storage classes with OpenShift templates (CLI only)

{product-title} ships with a number of templates that can be used to quickly deploy
popular applications and frameworks. These are listed in the catalog when using
the web console and are viewable from CLI by viewing the output of:

----
$ oc get templates -n openshift
----

Some of these templates include PVC definitions to provide persistent storage,
but they do not natively support selection of a non-default storage class.
However, there are plans to support this in the future.
To use a template with a specific storage class, you need to copy the
template to disk and edit it prior to using it. For example, if you want to
use the MongoDB template with a PVC in us-east-2b:

.  Copy the template to a file:
+
----
$ oc get template -n openshift mongodb-persistent -o yaml --export > mongodb-persistent.yml
----

.  Look through the file for any PersistentVolumeClaim definitions and edit
them to include an option to specify the storage class. The MongoDB template has
one PVC defined. The line highlighted below shows what needs to be added to allow
specification of a non-default storage class
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: ${DATABASE_SERVICE_NAME}
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: ${VOLUME_CAPACITY}
  storageClassName: ${STORAGE_CLASS_NAME}
----

. At the bottom of the template file, add the new parameter
`STORAGE_CLASS_NAME` to the parameter list
+
[source,yaml]
----
description: Storage class to use for persistent storage
displayName: Storage class name
name: STORAGE_CLASS_NAME
required: true
----

Now that you have an updated template, you can use it from the CLI or web console.
From the CLI, you can pass in the required parameters to `oc process` and
create them.

----
$ oc process -f mongodb-export.yml \
STORAGE_CLASS_NAME=gp2-encrypted-us-east-2b | oc create -f
----

Alternatively, you can upload your template via the web console and fill out the parameters
of the template interactively. To do so, select *Import YAML / JSON* from the
*Add to Project* drop-down menu in the application console.

image::add-to-project.png[Import yaml/json to project,title="Import yaml/json to project"]

Now, you can either upload your template file or copy and paste it into the
provided text field and then click *Create*. Now, you can opt to process
and/or save your template file to the selected namespace for future use.
If you process the template, you are directed to a page to fill out the available
template parameters, including the desired storage class. After populating the parameters,
you can create the MongoDB service and confirm that your PVC has been created in
the correct AZ.

[[osd-multi-az-pvc-best-practices]]
=== Best practices

It is very important to deliberately select a storage class when provisioning
PVCs in a multi-AZ {product-title} cluster. If every PVC is always provisioned by the
default storage class, this can lead to problems in the future.

One of these problems is an uneven distribution of workload. If you are
primarily running workloads that make use of persistent storage, and you always
provision that storage using the default storage class, all of your pods will be
scheduled to nodes in that AZ. This can lead to a situation where the nodes in
one AZ are running out of capacity while the rest of the cluster is
underutilized. Once you are in this state, there is not an easy method to
redistribute the workloads. Any redistribution will require backing up and
restoring the contents of PVs manually. The other problem with this state is
that it effectively undermines the point of a multi-AZ cluster in the first
place. If your default storage class' AZ fails, a significant amount of your
workload could be lost with it.

====
Block volume support is a Technology Preview feature and it is only available for manually provisioned PVs.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service

You can statically provision raw block volumes by including API fields
in your PV and PVC specifications.

To use block volume, you must first enable the `BlockVolume` feature gate. To
enable the feature gates for master(s), add `feature-gates` to
`apiServerArguments` and `controllerArguments`. To enable the feature gates for
node(s), add `feature-gates` to `kubeletArguments`. For example:

----
kubeletArguments:
   feature-gates:
     - BlockVolume=true
