== Overview

Managing storage is a distinct problem from managing compute resources.
{product-title} leverages the Kubernetes persistent volume (PV) framework to allow
administrators to provision persistent storage for a cluster. Using persistent
volume claims (PVCs), developers can request PV resources without having
specific knowledge of the underlying storage infrastructure.

PVCs are specific to a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#projects[project]
and are created and used by developers as a means to use a PV. PV resources on
their own are not scoped to any single project; they can be shared across the
entire {product-title} cluster and claimed from any project. After a PV has been
xref:binding[_bound_] to a PVC, however, that PV cannot then be bound to
additional PVCs. This has the effect of scoping a bound PV to a single
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#namespaces[namespace]
(that of the binding project).

PVs are defined by a `PersistentVolume` API object, which represents a piece
of existing, networked storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an
administrator. It is a resource in the cluster just like a node is a cluster
resource. PVs are volume plug-ins like `Volumes`, but have a lifecycle
independent of any individual
xref:../core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#pods[pod] that uses the PV. PV
objects capture the details of the implementation of the storage, be that NFS,
iSCSI, or a cloud-provider-specific storage system.

[IMPORTANT]
====
High availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.
====

PVCs are defined by a `PersistentVolumeClaim` API object, which represents a
request for storage by a developer. It is similar to a pod in that pods consume
node resources and PVCs consume PV resources. For example, pods can request
specific levels of resources (e.g., CPU and memory), while PVCs can request
specific xref:pv-capacity[storage capacity] and xref:pv-access-modes[access
modes] (e.g, they can be mounted once read/write or many times read-only).

[[lifecycle-of-a-volume-and-claim]]

== Lifecycle of a Volume and Claim

PVs are resources in the cluster. PVCs are requests for those resources and also
act as claim checks to the resource. The interaction between PVs and PVCs have
the following lifecycle.

[[provisioning]]

=== Provisioning

In response to requests from a developer defined in a PVC, a cluster
administrator configures one or more dynamic provisioners that provision storage
and a matching PV.

Alternatively, a cluster administrator can create a number of PVs in advance,
which carry the details of the real storage that is available for use by cluster
users. PVs exist in the API and are available for consumption.

[[binding]]

=== Binding

A user creates a `PersistentVolumeClaim` with a specific amount of storage
requested and with certain access modes and optionally a `StorageClass`. A
control loop in the master watches for new PVCs. It either finds a matching PV
or waits for a provisioner for the `StorageClass` to create one, then binds them
together.

The user will always get at least what they asked for, but the volume might be
in excess of what was requested. This is especially true with manually
provisioned PVs. To minimize the excess, {product-title} binds to the smallest
PV that matches all other criteria.

Claims remain unbound indefinitely if a matching volume does not exist or cannot
be created with any available provisioner servicing a `StorageClass`. Claims
are bound as matching volumes become available. For example, a cluster
with many manually provisioned 50Gi volumes would not match a PVC requesting
100Gi. The PVC can be bound when a 100Gi PV is added to the cluster.

[[using]]

=== Using

Pods use claims as volumes. The cluster inspects the claim to find the bound
volume and mounts that volume for a pod. For those volumes that support multiple
access modes, the user specifies which mode is desired when using their claim as
a volume in a pod.

Once a user has a claim and that claim is bound, the bound PV belongs to the
user for as long as they need it. Users schedule pods and access their claimed
PVs by including a `persistentVolumeClaim` in their pod's volumes block. See
xref:pvc-claims-as-volumes[below] for syntax details.

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]

[[pvcprotection]]
=== Persistent Volume Claim Protection

[NOTE]
====
PVC protection is an alpha feature and may change in a future release of {product-title}.
====

The purpose of PVC protection is to ensure that PVCs in active use by a pod are not removed from the system, as this may result in data loss.

[NOTE]
====
A PVC is in active use by a pod when the the pod status is `Pending`, and the pod is assigned to a node or the pod status is `Running`.
====

When the PVC protection feature is enabled, if a user deletes a PVC in active use by a pod, the PVC is not immediately removed. PVC removal is postponed until the PVC is no longer actively used by any pods.

You can see that a PVC is protected when the PVC's status is `Terminating` and the `Finalizers` list includes `kubernetes.io/pvc-protection`:
[source, shell]
----
oc describe pvc hostpath
Name:          hostpath
Namespace:     default
StorageClass:  example-hostpath
Status:        Terminating

               volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-provisioner=example.com/hostpath

...
----

To enable PVC protection, see xref:../../install_config/configuring_pvc_protection.adoc#install-config-configuring-pvc-protection[Configuring Persistent Volume Claim Protection].

endif::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]

[[releasing]]
=== Releasing

When a user is done with a volume, they can delete the PVC object from the API
which allows reclamation of the resource. The volume is considered "released"
when the claim is deleted, but it is not yet available for another claim. The
previous claimant's data remains on the volume which must be handled according
to policy.

[[reclaiming]]

=== Reclaiming

The reclaim policy of a `PersistentVolume` tells the cluster what to do with
the volume after it is released. Volumes reclaim policy can either be `Retained`, `Recycled`, or `Deleted`.

`Retained` reclaim policy allows manual reclamation of the resource for those volume plug-ins that support it. `Deleted` reclaim policy deletes both the `PersistentVolume` object from {product-title} and the associated storage asset in external infrastructure, such as AWS EBS, GCE PD, or Cinder volume.

[NOTE]
====
Volumes that were dynamically provisioned are always deleted.
====

[[recycling]]

==== Recycling

If supported by appropriate volume plug-in, recycling performs a basic scrub (`rm -rf /thevolume/*`) on the volume and makes it available again for a new claim.

[WARNING]
====
The `recycle` reclaim policy is deprecated in favor of dynamic provisioning and is removed starting in {product-title} 3.6.
====

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]

You can configure a custom recycler pod template using the controller manager command line arguments as described in the  xref:../../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-config-admission-control-config[ControllerArguments] section. The custom recycler pod template must contain a `volumes` specification, as shown in the example below:


[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pv-recycler-
  namespace: openshift-infra <1>
spec:
  restartPolicy: Never
  serviceAccount: pv-recycler-controller <2>
  volumes:
  - name: nfsvol
    nfs:
      server: any-server-it-will-be-replaced <3>
      path: any-path-it-will-be-replaced <3>
  containers:
  - name: pv-recycler
    image: "gcr.io/google_containers/busybox"
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "test -e /scrub && rm -rf /scrub/..?* /scrub/.[!.]* /scrub/*  && test -z \"$(ls -A /scrub)\" || exit 1"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: nfsvol
      mountPath: /scrub
----

<2> Name of service account that is allowed to mount NFS volumes. It must exist in the specified namespace. A `pv-recycler-controller` account is recommended, as it is automatically created in `openshift-infra` namespace and has all the required permissions.
<3> The particular `server` and `path` values specified in the custom recycler pod template in the `volumes` part is replaced with the particular corresponding values from the PV that is being recycled.

[[pv-capacity]]

=== Capacity

Generally, a PV has a specific storage capacity. This is set using the
PV's `capacity` attribute.

Currently, storage capacity is the only resource that can be set or requested.
Future attributes may include IOPS, throughput, etc.

[[pv-access-modes]]

=== Access Modes

A `PersistentVolume` can be mounted on a host in any way supported by the
resource provider. Providers have different capabilities and each PV's
access modes are set to the specific modes supported by that particular volume.
For example, NFS can support multiple read/write clients, but a specific NFS PV
might be exported on the server as read-only. Each PV gets its own set of access
modes describing that specific PV's capabilities.

Claims are matched to volumes with similar access modes. The only two matching
criteria are access modes and size. A claim's access modes represent a request.
Therefore, the user may be granted more, but never less. For example, if a claim
requests RWO, but the only volume available was an NFS PV (RWO+ROX+RWX), the
claim would match NFS because it supports RWO.

Direct matches are always attempted first. The volume's modes must match or
contain more modes than you requested. The size must be greater than or equal to
what is expected. If two types of volumes (NFS and iSCSI, for example) both have
the same set of access modes, then either of them will match a claim with those
modes. There is no ordering between types of volumes and no way to choose one
type over another.

All volumes with the same modes are grouped, then sorted by size (smallest to
largest). The binder gets the group with matching modes and iterates over each
(in size order) until one size matches.

The access modes are:

[cols="1,1,3",options="header"]
|===

|Access Mode |CLI Abbreviation |Description

|ReadWriteOnce
|`RWO`
|The volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node.

|ReadOnlyMany
|`ROX`
|The volume can be mounted read-only by many nodes.

|ReadWriteMany
|`RWX`
|The volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes.

|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
A volume's `AccessModes` are descriptors of the volume's capabilities. They
are not enforced constraints. The storage provider is responsible for runtime
errors resulting from invalid use of the resource.

For example, a GCE Persistent Disk has `AccessModes` *ReadWriteOnce* and
*ReadOnlyMany*. The user must mark their claims as `read-only` if they want to
take advantage of the volume's ability for ROX. Errors in the provider show up
at runtime as mount errors.

iSCSI and Fibre Channel volumes do not have any fencing mechanisms yet. You must
ensure the volumes are only used by one node at a time. In certain situations,
such as draining a node, the volumes may be used simultaneously by two nodes.
Before draining the node, first ensure the pods that use these volumes are
deleted.
====

The table below lists the access modes supported by different PVs:

[[pv-mount-options]]
=== Mount Options

You can specify mount options while mounting a PV by using the annotation `volume.beta.kubernetes.io/mount-options`.

For example:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv0001
  annotations:
    volume.beta.kubernetes.io/mount-options: rw,nfsvers=4,noexec <1>
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  nfs:
    path: /tmp
    server: 172.17.0.2
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Recycle
  claimRef:
    name: claim1

----
<1> Specified mount options are then used while mounting the PV to the disk.

The following PV types support mount options:

- NFS
- GlusterFS
- Ceph RBD
- OpenStack Cinder
- AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS)
- GCE Persistent Disk
- iSCSI
- Azure Disk
- Azure File
- VMWare vSphere

[NOTE]
====

  storageClassName: gold

----

[[pvc-storage-class]]
=== Storage Class

Claims can optionally request a specific `StorageClass` by specifying its name
in the `storageClassName` attribute. Only PVs of the requested class, ones with
the same `storageClassName` as the PVC, can be bound to the PVC. The cluster
administrator can configure dynamic provisioners to service one or more storage
classes. They create a PV on demand that matches the specifications in the PVC,
if they are able.

The cluster administrator can also set a default `StorageClass` for all PVCs.
When a default storage class is configured, the PVC must explicitly ask for
`StorageClass` or `storageClassName` annotations set to `""` to get bound to a
PV with a no storage class.

[[pvc-access-modes]]
=== Access Modes

Claims use the same conventions as volumes when requesting storage with specific
access modes.

[[pvc-resources]]

=== Resources

Claims, like pods, can request specific quantities of a resource. In this case,
the request is for storage. The same resource model applies to both volumes and claims.

[[pvc-claims-as-volumes]]

=== Claims As Volumes

Pods access storage by using the claim as a volume. Claims must exist in the
same namespace as the pod using the claim. The cluster finds the claim in the
pod's namespace and uses it to get the `PersistentVolume` backing the claim.
The volume is then mounted to the host and into the pod:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myfrontend
