== Overview

Managing storage is a distinct problem from managing compute resources.
{product-title} leverages the Kubernetes persistent volume (PV) framework to allow
administrators to provision persistent storage for a cluster. Using persistent
volume claims (PVCs), developers can request PV resources without having
specific knowledge of the underlying storage infrastructure.

PVCs are specific to a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#projects[project]
and are created and used by developers as a means to use a PV. PV resources on
their own are not scoped to any single project; they can be shared across the
entire {product-title} cluster and claimed from any project. After a PV has been
xref:binding[_bound_] to a PVC, however, that PV cannot then be bound to
additional PVCs. This has the effect of scoping a bound PV to a single
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#namespaces[namespace]
(that of the binding project).

PVs are defined by a `PersistentVolume` API object, which represents a piece
of existing networked storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an
administrator. It is a resource in the cluster just like a node is a cluster
resource. PVs are volume plug-ins like `Volumes`, but have a lifecycle
independent of any individual
xref:../core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#pods[pod] that uses the PV. PV
objects capture the details of the implementation of the storage, be that NFS,
iSCSI, or a cloud-provider-specific storage system.

[IMPORTANT]
====
High-availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.
====

PVCs are defined by a `PersistentVolumeClaim` API object, which represents a
request for storage by a developer. It is similar to a pod in that pods consume
node resources and PVCs consume PV resources. For example, pods can request
specific levels of resources (e.g., CPU and memory), while PVCs can request
specific xref:pv-capacity[storage capacity] and xref:pv-access-modes[access
modes] (e.g, they can be mounted once read/write or many times read-only).

[[lifecycle-of-a-volume-and-claim]]

== Lifecycle of a Volume and Claim

PVs are resources in the cluster. PVCs are requests for those resources and also
act as claim checks to the resource. The interaction between PVs and PVCs have
the following lifecycle.

[[provisioning]]

=== Provisioning

A cluster administrator creates some number of PVs. They carry the details of
the real storage that is available for use by cluster users. They exist in the
API and are available for consumption.

[[binding]]

=== Binding

A user creates a `PersistentVolumeClaim` with a specific amount of storage
requested and with certain access modes. A control loop in the master watches
for new PVCs, finds a matching PV (if possible), and binds them together. The
user will always get at least what they asked for, but the volume may be in
excess of what was requested. To minimize the excess, {product-title} binds to
the smallest PV that matches all other criteria.

Claims remain unbound indefinitely if a matching volume does not exist. Claims
are bound as matching volumes become available. For example, a cluster
provisioned with many 50Gi volumes would not match a PVC requesting 100Gi. The
PVC can be bound when a 100Gi PV is added to the cluster.

[[using]]

=== Using

Pods use claims as volumes. The cluster inspects the claim to find the bound
volume and mounts that volume for a pod. For those volumes that support multiple
access modes, the user specifies which mode is desired when using their claim as
a volume in a pod.

Once a user has a claim and that claim is bound, the bound PV belongs to the
user for as long as they need it. Users schedule pods and access their claimed
PVs by including a `persistentVolumeClaim` in their pod's volumes block. See
xref:pvc-claims-as-volumes[below] for syntax details.

[[releasing]]

=== Releasing

When a user is done with a volume, they can delete the PVC object from the API
which allows reclamation of the resource. The volume is considered "released"
when the claim is deleted, but it is not yet available for another claim. The
previous claimant's data remains on the volume which must be handled according
to policy.

[[reclaiming]]

=== Reclaiming

The reclaim policy of a `PersistentVolume` tells the cluster what to do with
the volume after it is released. Currently, volumes can either be _retained_ or
_recycled_.

Retention allows for manual reclamation of the resource. For those volume
plug-ins that support it, recycling performs a basic scrub on the volume (e.g.,
`rm -rf /<volume>/*`) and makes it available again for a new claim.

[[persistent-volumes]]

== Persistent Volumes

Each PV contains a `spec` and `status`, which is the specification and
status of the volume.

[[pv-capacity]]

=== Capacity

Generally, a PV will have a specific storage capacity. This is set using the
PV's `capacity` attribute. See the
link:https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/design/resources.md[Kubernetes
Resource Model] to understand the units expected by `capacity`.

Currently, storage capacity is the only resource that can be set or requested.
Future attributes may include IOPS, throughput, etc.

[[pv-access-modes]]

=== Access Modes

A `PersistentVolume` can be mounted on a host in any way supported by the
resource provider. Providers will have different capabilities and each PV's
access modes are set to the specific modes supported by that particular volume.
For example, NFS can support multiple read/write clients, but a specific NFS PV
might be exported on the server as read-only. Each PV gets its own set of access
modes describing that specific PV's capabilities.

Claims are matched to volumes with similar access modes. The only two matching
criteria are access modes and size. A claim's access modes represent a request.
Therefore, the user may be granted more, but never less. For example, if a claim
requests RWO, but the only volume available was an NFS PV (RWO+ROX+RWX), the
claim would match NFS because it supports RWO.

Direct matches are always attempted first. The volume's modes must match or
contain more modes than you requested. The size must be greater than or equal to
what is expected. If two types of volumes (NFS and iSCSI, for example) both have
the same set of access modes, then either of them will match a claim with those
modes. There is no ordering between types of volumes and no way to choose one
type over another.

All volumes with the same modes are grouped, then sorted by size (smallest to
largest). The binder gets the group with matching modes and iterates over each
(in size order) until one size matches.

The access modes are:

[cols="1,1,3",options="header"]
|===

|Access Mode |CLI Abbreviation |Description

|ReadWriteOnce
|`RWO`
|The volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node.

|ReadOnlyMany
|`ROX`
|The volume can be mounted read-only by many nodes.

|ReadWriteMany
|`RWX`
|The volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes.

|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
A volume's `AccessModes` are descriptors of the volume's capabilities. They
are not enforced constraints. The storage provider is responsible for runtime
errors resulting from invalid use of the resource.

For example, a GCE Persistent Disk has `AccessModes` *ReadWriteOnce* and
*ReadOnlyMany*. The user must mark their claims as `read-only` if they want to
take advantage of the volume's ability for ROX. Errors in the provider show up
at runtime as mount errors.
====

The table below lists the access modes supported by different persistent volumes:

[NOTE]
====
 * If pods rely on AWS EBS, GCE Persistent Disks, or Openstack Cinder PVs, use a xref:../../dev_guide/deployments/deployment_strategies.adoc#recreate-strategy[recreate deployment strategy]
  * Azure Disk does not support dynamic provisioning.
====

ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
The following restrictions apply when using persistent volumes with OpenShift Dedicated:

[IMPORTANT]
====
 * Pvs are provisioned with either EBS volumes (AWS) or GCP storage (GCP), depending on where the cluster is provisioned.
 * Only RWO access mode is applicable, since EBS volumes and GCE Persistent Disks cannot be mounted to multiple nodes.
 * *EmptyDir* has the same lifecycle as the pod:
   ** *EmptyDir* volumes survive container crashes/restarts.
   ** *EmptyDir* volumes are deleted when the pod is deleted.
====
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-online[]
The following restrictions apply when using persistent volumes with OpenShift Online:

[IMPORTANT]
====
 * Each project can create at most two PV claims.
 * Each PV is restricted to 1 Gi.
 * PVs are provisioned with EBS volumes (AWS).
 * Only RWO access access mode is applicable, since EBS volumes and GCE Persistent Disks cannot be mounted to to multiple nodes.
 * Docker volumes are disabled.
   ** VOLUME directive without a mapped external volume fails to be instantiated.
 * *EmptyDir* is restricted to 512 Mi per project (group) per node.
   ** If there is a single pod for a project on a particular node, then the pod can consume up to 512 Mi of *emptyDir* storage.
   ** If there are multiple pods for a project on a particular node, then those pods will share the 512 Mi of *emptyDir* storage.
 *  *EmptyDir* has the same lifecycle as the pod:
   ** *EmptyDir* volumes survive container crashes/restarts.
   ** *EmptyDir* volumes are deleted when the pod is deleted.

[[pv-recycling-policy]]

=== Recycling Policy

The current recycling policies are:

[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===

|Recycling Policy |Description

|Retain
|Manual reclamation

|Recycle
|Basic scrub (e.g, `rm -rf /<volume>/*`)

|===

[NOTE]
====
Currently, only NFS and HostPath support the 'Recycle' recycling policy.
====

[[pv-phase]]

=== Phase

A volumes can be found in one of the following phases:

[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===

|Phase |Description

|Available
|A free resource that is not yet bound to a claim.

|Bound
|The volume is bound to a claim.

|Released
|The claim has been deleted, but the resource is not yet reclaimed by the
cluster.

|Failed
|The volume has failed its automatic reclamation.

|===

The CLI shows the name of the PVC bound to the PV.

[[persistent-volume-claims]]

== Persistent Volume Claims

Each PVC contains a `spec` and `status`, which is the specification and
status of the claim.

.Persistent Volume Claim Object Definition
====

[source,yaml]
----
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: myclaim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 8Gi

----
====

[[pvc-access-modes]]
=== Access Modes

Claims use the same conventions as volumes when requesting storage with specific
access modes.

[[pvc-resources]]

=== Resources

Claims, like pods, can request specific quantities of a resource. In this case,
the request is for storage. The same
link:https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/design/resources.md[resource
model] applies to both volumes and claims.

[[pvc-claims-as-volumes]]

=== Claims As Volumes

Pods access storage by using the claim as a volume. Claims must exist in the
same namespace as the pod using the claim. The cluster finds the claim in the
pod's namespace and uses it to get the `PersistentVolume` backing the claim.
The volume is then mounted to the host and into the pod:

====

[source,yaml]
----
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myfrontend
      image: dockerfile/nginx
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: "/var/www/html"
        name: mypd
  volumes:
    - name: mypd
