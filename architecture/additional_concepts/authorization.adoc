== Overview
Authorization policies determine whether a user is allowed to perform a given
link:#action[action] within a project. This allows platform administrators to
use the link:#cluster-policy-and-local-policy[cluster policy] to control who has
various access levels to the OpenShift platform itself and all projects. It also
allows developers to use link:#cluster-policy-and-local-policy[local policy] to
control who has access to their
link:../core_concepts/projects_and_users.html#projects[projects]. Note that
authorization is a separate step from link:authentication.html[authentication],
which is more about determining the identity of who is taking the action.

Authorization is managed using:

[cols="1,7"]
|===

|[[rules-def]]*Rules* |Sets of permitted link:#action[verbs] on a set of
link:../core_concepts/overview.html[objects]. For example, whether something can
`create` pods.

|[[roles-def]]*Roles* |Collections of rules.
link:authentication.html#users-and-groups[Users and groups] can be associated
with, or _bound_ to, multiple link:#roles[roles] at the same time.

|[[bindings]]*Bindings* |Associations between users and/or groups with a
link:#roles[role].

|===

Rules, roles, and bindings can be visualized
link:../../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.html#viewing-roles-and-bindings[using
the CLI]. For example, consider the following excerpt from
link:../../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.html#viewing-roles-and-bindings[viewing
a policy], showing rule sets for the *admin* and *basic-user*
link:#roles[default roles]:

====

[[evaluating-authorization]]

== Evaluating Authorization

Several factors are combined to make the decision when OpenShift evaluates
authorization:

[cols="1,7"]
|===

|[[identity]]*Identity* |In the context of authorization, both the user name and
list of groups the user belongs to.

|[[action]]*Action* a|The action being performed. In most cases, this consists of:

[horizontal]
Project:: The link:../core_concepts/projects_and_users.html#projects[project]
being accessed.
Verb:: Can be `get`, `list`, `create`, `update`, or others.
Resource Name:: The API endpoint being accessed.

|*Bindings* |The full list of link:#bindings[bindings].

|===

OpenShift evaluates authorizations using the following steps:

. The identity and the project-scoped action is used to find all bindings that
apply to the user or their groups.
. Bindings are used to locate all the roles that apply.
. Roles are used to find all the rules that apply.
. The action is checked against each rule to find a match.
. If no matching rule is found, the action is then denied by default.

[[cluster-policy-and-local-policy]]

== Cluster Policy and Local Policy
There are two levels of authorization policy:

[cols="1,4"]
|===

|*Cluster policy* |link:#roles[Roles] and bindings that are applicable across
all projects. Roles that exist in the cluster policy are considered _cluster
roles_. Cluster bindings can only reference cluster roles.

|*Local policy* |link:#roles[Roles] and bindings that are scoped to a given
project. Roles that exist only in a local policy are considered _local roles_.
Local bindings can reference both cluster and local roles.

|===

This two-level hierarchy allows re-usability over multiple projects through the
cluster policy while allowing customization inside of individual projects
through local policies.

During evaluation, both the cluster bindings and the local bindings are used.
For example:

. Cluster-wide "allow" rules are checked.
. Locally-bound "allow" rules are checked.
. Deny by default.

[[roles]]

== Roles
Roles are collections of policy link:#rules-def[rules], which are sets of
permitted verbs that can be performed on a set of resources. OpenShift includes
a set of default roles that can be added to users and groups in the
link:#cluster-policy-and-local-policy[cluster policy] or in a
link:#cluster-policy-and-local-policy[local policy].

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|===

|Default Role |Description

|*admin* |A project manager. If used in a
link:#cluster-policy-and-local-policy[local binding], an *admin* user will have
rights to view any resource in the project and modify any resource in the
project except for role creation and quota. If the *cluster-admin* wants to
allow an *admin* to modify roles, the *cluster-admin* must create a
project-scoped `*Policy*` object using JSON.

|*basic-user* |A user that can get basic information about projects and users.

|*cluster-admin* |A super-user that can perform any action in any project. When
granted to a user within a local policy, they have full control over quota and
roles and every action on every resource in the project.

|*cluster-status* |A user that can get basic cluster status information.

|*edit* |A user that can modify most objects in a project, but does not have the
power to view or modify roles or bindings.

|*self-provisioner* |A user that can create their own projects.

|*view* |A user who cannot make any modifications, but can see most objects in a
project. They cannot view or modify roles or bindings.

|===

TIP: Remember that link:authentication.html#users-and-groups[users
and groups] can be associated with, or _bound_ to, multiple roles at the same
time.

These roles, including a matrix of the verbs and resources each are associated
with, can be visualized in the cluster policy by using the CLI to
link:../../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.html#viewing-cluster-roles[view
the cluster roles]. Additional *+++system:*+++* roles are listed as well, which
are used for various OpenShift system and component operations.

By default in a local policy, only the binding for the *admin* role is
immediately listed when using the CLI to
link:../../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.html#viewing-local-bindings[view
local bindings]. However, if other default roles are added to users and groups
within a local policy, they become listed in the CLI output, as well.

If you find that these roles do not suit you, a *cluster-admin* user can create
a `*policyBinding*` object named `_<projectname>_:default` with the CLI using a
JSON file. This allows the project *admin* to bind users to roles that are
defined only in the `_<projectname>_` local policy.

[[security-context-constraints]]

== Security Context Constraints
In addition to link:#overview[authorization policies] that control what a user
can do, OpenShift provides _security context constraints_ (SCC) that control the
actions that a link:../core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#pods[pod] can
perform and what it has the ability to access.

SCCs are objects that define a set of conditions that a pod must run with in
order to be accepted into the system. They allow an administrator to control the
following:

. Running of
link:../../admin_guide/install/prerequisites.html#security-warning[privileged
containers].
. Capabilities a container can request to be added.
. Use of host directories as volumes.
. The SELinux context of the container.
. The user ID.

Two SCCs are added to the cluster by default, _privileged_ and _restricted_,
which are viewable by cluster administrators using the CLI:

====
----
$ oc get scc
NAME         PRIV      CAPS      HOSTDIR   SELINUX     RUNASUSER
privileged   true      []        true      RunAsAny    RunAsAny
restricted   false     []        false     MustRunAs   MustRunAsRange
----
====

The definition for each SCC is also viewable by cluster administrators using the
CLI. For example, for the privileged SCC:

====
----
$ oc export scc/privileged
allowHostDirVolumePlugin: true
allowPrivilegedContainer: true
apiVersion: v1
groups: <1>
- system:cluster-admins
- system:nodes
kind: SecurityContextConstraints
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: privileged
runAsUser:
  type: RunAsAny <2>
seLinuxContext:
  type: RunAsAny <3>
users: <4>
- system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:build-controller
----

<1> The groups that have access to this SCC
<2> The run as user strategy type which dictates the allowable values for the Security Context
<3> The SELinux context strategy type which dictates the allowable values for the Security Context
<4> The users who have access to this SCC
====

The `*users*` and `*groups*` fields on the SCC control which SCCs can be used.
By default, cluster administrators, nodes, and the build controller are granted
access to the privileged SCC. All authenticated users are granted access to the
restricted SCC.

The privileged SCC:

- allows privileged pods.
- allows host directories to be mounted as volumes.
- allows a pod to run as any user.
- allows a pod to run with any MCS label.

The restricted SCC:

- ensures pods cannot run as privileged.
- ensures pods cannot use host directory volumes.
- requires that a pod run as a user in a pre-allocated range of UIDs.
- requires that a pod run with a pre-allocated MCS label.

SCCs are comprised of settings and strategies that control the security features
a pod has access to. These settings fall into three categories:

[cols="1,4"]
|===

|*Controlled by a boolean*
|Fields of this type default to the most restrictive value. For example,
`*AllowPrivilegedContainer*` is always set to *false* if unspecified.

|*Controlled by an allowable set*
|Fields of this type are checked against the set to ensure their value is
allowed.

|*Controlled by a strategy*
a|Items that have a strategy to generate a value provide:

- A mechanism to generate the value, and
- A mechanism to ensure that a specified value falls into the set of allowable
values.

|===

[[admission]]

=== Admission
_Admission control_ with SCCs allows for control over the creation of resources
based on the capabilities granted to a user.

In terms of the SCCs, this means that an admission controller can inspect the
user information made available in the context to retrieve an appropriate set of
SCCs. Doing so ensures the pod is authorized to make requests about its
operating environment or to generate a set of constraints to apply to the pod.

The set of SCCs that admission uses to authorize a pod are determined by the
user identity and groups that the user belongs to. Additionally, if the pod
specifies a service account, the set of allowable SCCs includes any constraints
accessible to the service account.

Admission uses the following approach to create the final security context for
the pod:

. Retrieve all SCCs available for use.
. Generate field values for any security context setting that was not specified
on the request.
. Validate the final settings against the available constraints.

If a matching set of constraints is found, then the pod is accepted. If the
request cannot be matched to an SCC, the pod is rejected.
