Admission control plug-ins intercept requests to the master API prior to
persistence of a resource, but after the request is authenticated and
authorized.

Each admission control plug-in is run in sequence before a request is accepted
into the cluster. If any plug-in in the sequence rejects the request, the entire
request is rejected immediately, and an error is returned to the end-user.

Admission control plug-ins may modify the incoming object in some cases to apply
system configured defaults. In addition, admission control plug-ins may modify
related resources as part of request processing to do things such as
incrementing quota usage.

Cluster administrators can configure some admission control plug-ins to control
certain behavior, such as:
