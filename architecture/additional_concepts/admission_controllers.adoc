== Overview
Admission control plug-ins intercept requests to the master API prior to
persistence of a resource, but after the request is authenticated and
authorized.

Each admission control plug-in is run in sequence before a request is accepted
into the cluster. If any plug-in in the sequence rejects the request, the entire
request is rejected immediately, and an error is returned to the end-user.

Admission control plug-ins may modify the incoming object in some cases to apply
system configured defaults. In addition, admission control plug-ins may modify
related resources as part of request processing to do things such as
incrementing quota usage.

[WARNING]
====
The {product-title} master has a list of plug-ins that are enabled by
default for each type of resource (Kubernetes and {product-title}). These are
required for the proper functioning of the master. Future versions of the
product might use a different set of plug-ins and might change their ordering.
The default list of plug-ins is immutable.

[WARNING]
====
The {product-title} master has a default list of plug-ins that are enabled by
default for each type of resource (Kubernetes and {product-title}). These are
required for the proper functioning of the master. Modifying these lists is not
recommended unless you strictly know what you are doing. Future versions of the
product may use a different set of plug-ins and may change their ordering. If
you do override the default list of plug-ins in the master configuration file,
you are responsible for updating it to reflect requirements of newer versions of
the {product-title} master.

[[admission-controllers-general-admission-rules]]
== General Admission Rules

{product-title} uses a single admission chain for Kubernetes and {product-title}
resources. This means that the top-level
`*admissionConfig.pluginConfig*` element can now contain the admission plug-in
configuration, which used to be contained in
`*kubernetesMasterConfig.admissionConfig.pluginConfig*`.

The `*kubernetesMasterConfig.admissionConfig.pluginConfig*` should be moved and
merged into `*admissionConfig.pluginConfig*`.

All the supported admission plug-ins are ordered in the single chain for you.
You do not set `*admissionConfig.pluginOrderOverride*` or the
`*kubernetesMasterConfig.admissionConfig.pluginOrderOverride*`. Instead,
enable plug-ins that are off by default by either adding their
plug-in-specific configuration, or adding a `*DefaultAdmissionConfig*` stanza
like this:

====
[source,yaml]
----
admissionConfig:
  pluginConfig:
    AlwaysPullImages: <1>
      configuration:
        kind: DefaultAdmissionConfig
        apiVersion: v1
        disable: false <2>
----
<1> Admission plug-in name.
<2> Indicates that a plug-in should be enabled. It is optional and shown here only for reference.
====

Setting `*disable*` to *true* will disable an admission plug-in that defaults to on.

[WARNING]
====
Admission plug-ins are commonly used to help enforce security on the API server.
Be careful when disabling them.
====

[NOTE]
====
If you were previously using `*admissionConfig*` elements that cannot be safely
combined into a single admission chain, you will get a warning in your API
server logs and your API server will start with two separate admission chains
for legacy compatibility. Update your `*admissionConfig*` to resolve the
warning.
