Admission control plug-ins intercept requests to the master API prior to
persistence of a resource, but after the request is authenticated and
authorized.

Each admission control plug-in is run in sequence before a request is accepted
into the cluster. If any plug-in in the sequence rejects the request, the entire
request is rejected immediately, and an error is returned to the end-user.

Admission control plug-ins may modify the incoming object in some cases to apply
system configured defaults. In addition, admission control plug-ins may modify
related resources as part of request processing to do things such as
incrementing quota usage.

[WARNING]
====
The {product-title} master has a default list of plug-ins that are enabled by
default for each type of resource (Kubernetes and {product-title}). These are
required for the proper functioning of the master. Modifying these lists is not
recommended unless you strictly know what you are doing. Future versions of the
product may use a different set of plug-ins and may change their ordering. If
you do override the default list of plug-ins in the master configuration file,
you are responsible for updating it to reflect requirements of newer versions of
the {product-title} master.
====

Cluster administrators can configure some admission control plug-ins to control
certain behavior, such as:
