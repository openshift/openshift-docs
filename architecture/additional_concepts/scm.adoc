{product-title} takes advantage of preexisting source control management (SCM) systems
hosted either internally (such as an in-house Git server) or externally (for
example, on https://github.com/[GitHub], https://bitbucket.org/[Bitbucket],
etc.). Currently, {product-title} only supports https://git-scm.com/[Git] solutions.

SCM integration is tightly coupled with
xref:../core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-builds-and-image-streams[builds], the two points
being:

- Creating a `*BuildConfig*` using a repository, which allows building your
application inside of {product-title}. You can create a `*BuildConfig*`
xref:../../dev_guide/builds.adoc#defining-a-buildconfig[manually] or let
{product-title} create it xref:../../dev_guide/new_app.adoc#dev-guide-new-app[automatically] by
inspecting your repository.
- xref:../../dev_guide/builds.adoc#webhook-triggers[Triggering a build] upon
repository changes.
