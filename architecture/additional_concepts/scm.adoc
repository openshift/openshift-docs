{product-title} takes advantage of preexisting source control management (SCM) systems
hosted either internally (such as an in-house Git server) or externally (for
example, on link:https://github.com/[GitHub], link:https://bitbucket.org/[Bitbucket],
etc.). Currently, {product-title} only supports link:https://git-scm.com/[Git] solutions.

SCM integration is tightly coupled with
xref:../core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-builds-and-image-streams[builds],
the two points being:

- Creating a `BuildConfig` using a repository, which allows building your
application inside of {product-title}. You can create a `BuildConfig`
xref:../../dev_guide/builds/index.adoc#defining-a-buildconfig[manually] or let
{product-title} create it xref:../../dev_guide/application_lifecycle/new_app.adoc#dev-guide-new-app[automatically] by
inspecting your repository.
- xref:../../dev_guide/builds/triggering_builds.adoc#webhook-triggers[Triggering a build] upon
repository changes.
