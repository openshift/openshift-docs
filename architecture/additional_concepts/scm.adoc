OpenShift takes advantage of preexisting source control management (SCM) systems
hosted either internally (such as an in-house Git server) or externally (for
example, on https://github.com/[GitHub], https://bitbucket.org/[Bitbucket],
etc.). Currently, OpenShift only supports https://git-scm.com/[Git] solutions.

SCM integration is tightly coupled with link:../core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html[builds],
the two points being:

- Creating a `*BuildConfig*` using a repository, which allows building your
application inside of OpenShift. You can create a `*BuildConfig*`
link:../../dev_guide/builds.html#defining-a-buildconfig[manually] or let
OpenShift create it link:../../dev_guide/new_app.html[automatically] by
inspecting your repository.
- link:../../dev_guide/builds.html#webhook-triggers[Triggering a build] upon
repository changes.
