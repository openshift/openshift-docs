== Overview
{product-title} takes advantage of a feature built into Kubernetes to support port
forwarding to pods. This is implemented using HTTP along with a multiplexed
streaming protocol such as link:http://www.chromium.org/spdy[*SPDY*] or
link:https://http2.github.io/[*HTTP/2*].

Developers can xref:../../dev_guide/port_forwarding.adoc#dev-guide-port-forwarding[use the CLI] to port
forward to a pod. The CLI listens on each local port specified by the user,
forwarding via the xref:../../dev_guide/port_forwarding.adoc#protocol[described
protocol].

== Server Operation
The Kubelet handles port forward requests from clients. Upon receiving a
request, it upgrades the response and waits for the client to create port
forwarding streams. When it receives a new stream, it copies data between the
stream and the pod's port.

Architecturally, there are options for forwarding to a pod's port. The supported
implementation currently in {product-title} invokes `nsenter` directly on the
node host to enter the pod's network namespace, then invokes `socat` to copy
data between the stream and the pod's port. However, a custom implementation
could include running a "helper" pod that then runs `nsenter` and `socat`, so
that those binaries are not required to be installed on the host.
