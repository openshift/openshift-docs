== Overview
{product-title} takes advantage of a feature built into Kubernetes to support
executing commands in containers. This is implemented using HTTP along with a
multiplexed streaming protocol such as link:http://www.chromium.org/spdy[*SPDY*]
or link:https://http2.github.io/[*HTTP/2*].

Developers can xref:../../dev_guide/executing_remote_commands.adoc#dev-guide-executing-remote-commands[use the CLI]
to execute remote commands in containers.

== Server Operation
The Kubelet handles remote execution requests from clients. Upon receiving a
request, it upgrades the response, evaluates the request headers to determine
what streams (`stdin`, `stdout`, and/or `stderr`) to expect to receive, and waits
for the client to create the streams.

After the Kubelet has received all the streams, it executes the command in the
container, copying between the streams and the command's stdin, stdout, and
stderr, as appropriate. When the command terminates, the Kubelet closes the
upgraded connection, as well as the underlying one.

Architecturally, there are options for running a command in a container. The
supported implementation currently in {product-title} invokes `nsenter` directly
on the node host to enter the container's namespaces prior to executing the
command. However, custom implementations could include using `docker exec`, or
running a "helper" container that then runs `nsenter` so that `nsenter` is not a
required binary that must be installed on the host.
