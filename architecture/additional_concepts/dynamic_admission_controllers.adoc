== Overview

In addition to the default xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/admission_controllers.html#architecture-additional-concepts-admission-controllers[admission controllers], 
you can use _admission webhooks_ as part of the admission chain. 

Admission webhooks call webhook servers to either mutate pods upon creation, such as to inject labels, 
or to validate specific aspects of the pod configuration during the admission process.  

Admission webhooks intercept requests to the master API prior to the persistence of a resource, but after the request is authenticated and authorized.

There are two general types of dynamic admission controllers available in {product-title}:

* xref:architecture-additional-concepts-dynamic-admission-initializer[Initializers]. A user-customized controller that performs specific pre-initialization tasks.
* xref:architecture-additional-concepts-dynamic-admission-webhooks[External Admission Webhooks]. HTTPS callbacks that receive admission requests and performs specific tasks.

== Initializers

An *Initializer* is a user-customized controller, known as *initializer controllers*, 
that performs a list of pre-initialization tasks, stored in every object's metadata
(for example, *AddMyCorporatePolicySidecar*). Initializers are allowed to make mutations to objects.

Initializers intercept objects _before_ they are created, allowing you to interact with the objects in any way you like, or prevent the objects from being created.

[WARNING]
====
The initializer feature is an alpha feature and may change in a future release of {product-title}.
====

After an initializer has performed its assigned task, {product-title} removes the intializer from
the pre-initialization list. The list is called *metadata.initializers.pending*.

For example, an inititalizer, *AddContainertoPod*, sends a patch that inserts a container in a pod. After the pod is inserted, 
*AddContainertoPod* removes its name from `metadata.initializers.pending`. 

Objects which have a non-empty initializer list are considered _uninitialized_,
and are not visible in the API unless specifically requested by using the query parameter,
`includeUninitialized=true`.

Initializers are useful for administrators to force policies, such as an (xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/admission_controllers.adoc#admission-controllers-general-admission-rules
[Always Pull Images] policy that forces pods to pull images prior to starting containers.

[NOTE]
====
If your use case does not involve mutating objects, consider using
xref:architecture-additional-concepts-dynamic-admission-webhooks[external admission webhooks], 
for better performance.
====

As an {product-title} object is being created, the object is considered uninitialized. 
Uninitialized object are checked against all existing
xref:architecture-additional-concepts-dynamic-admission-initializer-config[`initializerConfiguration` objects]. 
All matching `spec.initializers[].name` are appended to the new object's
`metadata.initializers.pending` field.

An initializer controller then checks
check if its name matches `metadata.initializers.pending[0]`. If so, it should then
perform its assigned task and remove its name from the list.

[[architecture-additional-concepts-dynamic-admission-initializer-list]]
=== Create the List of Initializers

Set the list of pending initializers to exclude itself

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  initializers:
    pending:
      - initializer.project.io
  name: initializer
----

Set the pending initializers to an empty array:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  initializers:
    pending: []
----

Setting the pending initializers to empty on the metadata allows it to bypass the initializer.


Limit the scope of objects to be initialized to the smallest subset possible using an InitializerConfiguration. 

Examples:

The following initializer will work with only xref:../../dev_guide/deployments/how_deployments_work.adoc#dev-guide-how-deployments-work[deployment configuration objects]:

.Example initializer for only deployment objects

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: InitializerConfiguration
metadata:
  name: deploy
initializers:
  - name: deploy.initializer.kubernetes.io
    rules:
      - apiGroups:
          - "*"
        apiVersions:
          - "*"
        resources:
          - deployments
----

The following initializer Use annotations to enable opting in or out of initialization. Examples:

.Opting in using an annotation

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    "initializer.kubernetes.io": "true"
  labels:
    app: helloworld
  name: helloworld
...
----

[[architecture-additional-concepts-dynamic-admission-initializer-config]]
=== Configure Initializers

you should first deploy the initializer controller and make sure that it is
working properly before creating the `initializerConfiguration`. Otherwise, any
newly created resources will be stuck in an uninitialized state.

The following list represents a set of best practices to follow when building Initializers.

* Initializers must have a unique fully qualified name. Examples: initializer.vaultproject.io initializer.example.com
* Initializers should be deployed using a Deployment for easy upgrades and auto restarts.
* Initializers should explicitly set the list of pending initializers to exclude itself, or to an empty array, to avoid getting stuck waiting to initialize. Examples:

. Configure which initializers are enabled and which resource types need initialization
by creating *initializer configuration* resources.
+
The following is an example `initializerConfiguration`:
+
[source-yaml]
----
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: InitializerConfiguration
metadata:
  name: example-config
initializers:
  # the name needs to be fully qualified, i.e., containing at least two "."
  - name: podimage.example.com
    rules:
      # apiGroups, apiVersion, resources all support wildcard "*".
      # "*" cannot be mixed with non-wildcard.
      - apiGroups:
          - ""
        apiVersions:
          - v1
        resources:
          - pods
----
+
Ensure that all expansions of the `<apiGroup, apiVersions, resources>` tuple
in a `rule` are valid. If they are not, separate them in different `rules`.
+
After you create the `initializerConfiguration`, the system will take a few
seconds to honor the new configuration. 

. {product-title} appends the name of the initializer configuration object, here  `podimage.example.com`, 
to the `metadata.initializers.pending` field of any newly created pods. 

. An initializer controller should list and watch for uninitialized objects, by
using the query parameter `includeUninitialized=true`. If using client-go, just
set 
[listOptions.includeUninitialized](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.7.0-rc.1/staging/src/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1/types.go#L315)
to true.

== Admission Webhooks

In {product-title} you can use admission webhook objects that call webhook servers during the
API admission chain.

There are two types of admission webhook objects you can configure:

* xref:admission-webhooks-m[Mutating admission webhooks] allow for the use of mutating webhooks to modify resource content before it is persisted.

* xref:admission-webhooks-v[Validating admission webhooks] allow for the use of validating webhooks to enforce custom admission policies.   

Configuring the webhooks and external webhook servers is beyond the scope of this document. However, the webhooks must adhere to an
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.10.0-beta.1/staging/src/k8s.io/api/admission/v1beta1/types.go#L28[interface]
in order to work properly with {product-title}. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Admission webhooks* is a Technology Preview feature only.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to
upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide
feedback during the development process.

For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features support scope, see
https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.
endif::[]
====

When an object is instantiated, {product-title} makes an API call to admit the object. During the admission process, a _mutating admission controller_ 
can invoke webhooks to perform tasks, such as injecting affinity labels. At the end of the admissions process, 
a _validating admission controller_ can invoke webhooks to make sure the object is configured properly, such as verifying affinity labels. 
If the validation passes, {product-title} schedules the object as configured.

When the API request comes in, the mutating or validating admission controller 
uses the list of external webhooks in the configuration and calls them in parallel: 

* If *all* of the webhooks approve the request, the admission chain continues. 

* If *any* of the webhooks deny the request, the admission request is denied, and
the reason for doing so is based on the _first_ webhook denial reason. 
+
If more than one webhook denies the admission request, 
only the first will be returned to the user.

* If there is an error encountered when calling a
webhook, that request is either denied or the webhook is ignored.

The communication between the admission controller and the webhook server needs to be
secured using  TLS. Generate a CA certificate and use the certificate to sign the server certificate
used by your webhook server. The PEM-formatted CA certificate is supplied
to the admission controller using a mechanism, such as 
xref:../../dev_guide/secrets.adoc#service-serving-certificate-secrets[Service Serving Certificate Secrets].

The following diagram illustrates this process with two admission webhooks that call multiple webhooks.

image::api-server-pipeline.png["API admission stage", align="center"]

A simple example use case for admission webhooks is syntactical validation
of resources. For example, you have an infrastructure that requires all pods to
have a common set of labels, and you do not want any pod to be
persisted if the pod does not have those labels. You could write a webhook to inject these labels 
and another webhook to verify that the labels are present.
The {product-title} will then schedule pod that have the labels and pass validation
and reject pods that do not pass due to missing labels.

Some common use-cases include:

* Mutating resources to inject side-car containers into pods. 
* Restricting projects to block some resources from a project. 
* Custom resource validation to perform complex validation on dependent fields.

=== Types of Admission Webhooks

Cluster administrators can include _mutating admission webhooks_ or _validating admission webhooks_ 
in the admission chain of the API server.

[[admission-webhooks-m]]
*Mutating admission webhooks* are invoked during the mutation phase of the admission process, which allows modification of the resource content before it is persisted.  
One example of a mutating admission webhook is the 
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
xref:../../admin_guide/scheduling/pod_placement.adoc#constraining-pod-placement-nodeselector[Pod Node Selector] 
endif::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-online,openshift-dedicated[]
Pod Node Selector
endif::openshift-online,openshift-dedicated[]
feature, 
which uses an annotation on a namespace to find a label selector and add it to the pod specification.

Either `Ignore` (allow/fail open) or `Fail` (block/fail closed). 

[[admission-webhooks-v]]
*Validating admission webhooks* are invoked during the validation phase of the admission process. 
This phase allows the enforcement of invariants on particular API resources 
to ensure that the resource does not change again. The Pod Node Selector is also an example of a validation admission, 
by ensuring that all `nodeSelector` fields are constrained by the node selector restrictions on the project.

=== Create the Admission Webhook

To create an admission webhook, create an admission webhook object in {product-title}, 
create a service, and add labels to the object you want acted upon by the admission webhook.

Make sure the webhook and external webhook server are working properly. 
Otherwise, depending whether the webhook is configured as `fail open` or 
`fail closed`, operations will be unconditionally accepted or rejected. 

. Configure a xref:architecture-additional-concepts-dynamic-admission-webhooks-ex-m[mutating] 
or xref:architecture-additional-concepts-dynamic-admission-webhooks-ex-v[validating] admission webhook object in a YAML file.

. Run the following command to create the object:
+
----
oc create -f <file-name>.yaml
----
+
After you create the admission webhook object, {product-title} takes a few
seconds to honor the new configuration.

. Create a front-end service for the admission webhook:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    role: webhook <1>
  name: <name>
spec:
  selector:
   role: webhook <1>
----
+
<1> Free-form label to trigger the webhook.

. Run the following command to create the object:
+
----
oc create -f <file-name>.yaml
----

. Add the admission webhook name to pods you want controlled by the webhook:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    role: webhook <1>
  name: <name>
spec:
  containers:
    - name: <name>
      image: myrepo/myimage:latest
      imagePullPolicy: <policy>
      ports:
       - containerPort: 8000
----
+
<1> Label to trigger the webhook. 

[NOTE]
====
