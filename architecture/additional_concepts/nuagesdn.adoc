== Overview

link:http://www.nuagenetworks.net[Nuage Networks] provides a highly scalable policy-based SDN platform called Virtualized Services Platform (VSP). Nuage VSP uses the open source Open vSwitch for the data plane along with a feature rich SDN Controller.

The Nuage platform uses overlays to provide seamless policy-based networking between {product-title} and other environments consisting of VMs and bare metal servers. VSP's policy abstraction model makes it easy to declare fine-grained policies for applications. The platformâ€™s real-time analytics engine enables visibility and security monitoring for OpenShift applications.

Nuage VSP integrates with {product-title} to allows business applications to be quickly turned up and updated by removing the network lag faced by DevOps teams. The following figure shows various components involved in integrating Nuage VSP with {product-title}. There are two specific components responsible for the integration.

. The nuage-openshift-monitor which runs as a separate service on the {product-title} master node.
. The vsp-openshift plugin which is invoked by the {product-title} runtime on each of the nodes of the cluster.

Nuage Virtual Routing and Switching software is based on open source Open vSwitch and is responsible for the datapath forwarding. The VRS runs on each node and gets policy configuration from the controller.

== Nuage VSP Terminology

The following diagram describes some of the networking constructs that build the VSP platform.

.Nuage VSP Building Blocks
image::nuage_terminology.png[Nuage VSP Building Blocks]

 . Domains: An organization contains one or more domains. A domain is a single "Layer 3" space. In standard networking terminology, a domain maps to a VRF instance.
 . Zones: Zones are defined under a domain. A zone does not map to anything on the network directly, but instead it acts as an object with which policies are associated such that all endpoints in the zone adhere to the same set of policies.
 . Subnets: Subnets are defined under a zone. A subnet is a specific Layer 2 subnet within the domain instance. A subnet is unique and distinct within a domain, that is, subnets within a Domain are not allowed to overlap or to contain other subnets in accordance with the standard IP subnet definitions.
 . VPorts: A vPort is a new level in the domain hierarchy, intended to provide more granular configuration. In addition to containers and VMs, VPorts are also used to attach Host and Bridge Interfaces, which provide connectivity to Bare Metal servers, Appliances and Legacy VLANs.
 . PolicyGroup: PolicyGroups are collections of VPorts. 

== Mapping of Constructs

The {product-title} concepts described in xref:../core_concepts/index.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-index[core concepts] section have a direct mapping to 
Nuage VSP constructs. The following diagram shows the logical mapping of these concepts.

.Nuage VSP and {product-title} mapping
image::nuageopenshift_mapping.png[Nuage VSP and {product-title} mapping]

In particular, as explained in the figure above, a cluster in {product-title}, logically maps to a domain in VSP. If a particular enterprise has multiple {product-title} clusters, one for the developers, one for the test, one for staging and so on, each of those cluster translates simply to a separate domain in the VSP. Similarly, an {product-title} Project in a given cluster maps to a zone in VSP. In the Nuage integration, a subnet is not mapped to an Openshift node. This is one of the main differences from some of the existing overlay implementations which bind a subnet to a node. In other words, with the Nuage implementation, a given subnet for a particular project can span multiple nodes in {product-title}.

A pod getting spawned in  {product-title} translates to a virtual port getting created in VSP. The vsp-openshift plugin interacts with the VRS and gets policy for that virtual port from the VSD via the VSC. Policy groups are supported to group multiple pods together that must have the same set of policies applied to them. Currently, pods can only be assigned to policy groups using the <<nuagesdn.adoc#operations-workflow, operations workflow>> where a policy group is created by the administrative user in VSD. The pod being a part of the policy group is specified by means of nuage.io/policy-group label in the specification of the pod.

== Overview of {product-title} workflows

Integrating VSP with the {product-title} application workflow allows business applications to be quickly turned up and updated by removing the network lag faced by DevOps teams. VSP supports different workflows with {product-title} in order to accommodate scenarios where users can choose ease-of-use or complete control using policy-based automation.

[[developer-workflow]]

=== Developer workflow

This workflow is used in developer environments. 

It is called a Developer Workflow because there is very little input required from the developer in setting up the networking. In this workflow, the nuage-openshift-monitor is responsible for creating the VSP constructs (Zone, Subnets etc.) needed to provide appropriate policies and networking for pods created in an  {product-title} project. When a project gets created, a default zone and default subnet for that Project gets created by nuage-openshift-monitor. Also when the default subnet created for a given project gets depleted, the nuage-openshift-monitor dynamically creates additional subnets.

[NOTE]
====
Separate VSP Zone is created for each {product-title} project ensuring isolation amongst the projects.
====

[[operations-workflow]]

=== Operations workflow

This workflow is used by operations teams doing production roll outs of their applications.

In this workflow, the network and security policies are first configured on the VSD in accordance with the rules set by the organization to deploy applications. Administrative users can potentially create multiple zones and subnets and map them to the same project using labels. While spinning up the pods, the user can use the Nuage Labels to specify what network a pod needs to attach to and what network policies need to be applied to it. This allows for sophisticated deployments where inter- and intra-project traffic can be controlled in a fine-grained manner. For example, inter-project communication is enabled on a project by project basis. This may be used to connect projects to common services that are deployed in a shared project.

[[integration-components]]

== Integration Components

Nuage VSP integrates with OpenShift using two main components:

. nuage-openshift-monitor
. vsp-openshift plugin

[[nuage-openshift-monitor]]

=== nuage-openshift-monitor

The nuage-openshift-monitor is a service that monitors the {product-title} API server for creation of projects, services, users, user-groups etc.

[NOTE]
=====
In case of Highly Available (HA) {product-title} cluster with multiple masters, nuage-openshift-monitor process runs on all the masters independently without any change in functionality.
=====

For the developer workflow, the nuage-openshift-monitor also auto-creates VSD objects by exercising the VSD REST API to map OpenShift constructs to VSP constructs. Each cluster instance maps to a single domain in Nuage VSP. This allows a given enterprise to potentially have multiple cluster installations - one per domain instance for that Enterprise in Nuage. Each Openshift project is mapped to a zone in the domain of the cluster on the Nuage VSP. Whenever the nuage-openshift-monitor sees an addition/deletion of the project, it instantiates a zone using the VSDK APIs corresponding to that project and allocates a block of subnet for that zone. Additionally, the nuage-openshift-monitor also creates a network macro group for this project. Likewise, whenever the nuage-openshift-monitor sees an addition/deletion of a service, it creates a network macro corresponding to the service IP and assigns that network macro to the network macro group for that project (user provided network macro group using labels is also supported) to enable communication to that service.

For the developer workflow, all pods that get created within the zone get IPs from that subnet pool. The Subnet pool allocation and management is done by the nuage-openshift-monitor based on a couple of plugin specific parameters in the master-config file. However the actual IP address resolution and vport policy resolution is still done by VSD based on the domain/zone that gets instantiated when the project is created. If the initial subnet pool is exhausted, the nuage-openshift-monitor carves out an additional subnet from the cluster CIDR to assign to a given project.

For the operations workflow, the users specify Nuage recognized labels on their application/pod specification to resolve the pods into specific user-defined zones/subnets. This however cannot be used to resolve pods in the zones/subnets created via the developer workflow by nuage-openshift-monitor.

[NOTE]
=====
In the operations workflow, the administrator is responsible for pre-creating the VSD constructs to map the pods into a specific zone/subnet as well as allow communication between OpenShift entities (ACL rules, policy groups, network macros, and network macro groups). Detailed description of how to use Nuage labels is provided in the link:http://support.alcatel-lucent.com[Nuage VSP Openshift Integration Guide].
=====

[[vsp-openshift-plugin]]

=== vsp-openshift plugin

The vsp-openshift networking plugin is called by the {product-title} runtime on each OpenShift node. It implements the network plugin init and pod setup, teardown, and status hooks. The vsp-openshift plugin is also responsible for allocating the IP address for the pods. In particular, it communicates with the VRS (the forwarding engine) and configures the IP information onto the pod.
