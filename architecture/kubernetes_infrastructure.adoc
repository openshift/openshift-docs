Kubernetes is a system for managing containerized applications across a set of containers or hosts, providing deployment, maintenence, and application-scaling mechanisms. Docker is used to package, instantiate, and run containerized applications. 

A Kubernetes cluster consists of a master and a set of nodes. 

== Master

The Kubernetes master is the host or hosts that contain the master components (API Server, Controller Manger Server, etcd, etc.).

=== API Server

The Kubernetes API server serves the main API, and validates and configures the data for pods, services, and replication controllers. The Kuberbetes API server also assigns pods to nodes and synchronizes pod information with service configuration. 

=== etcd

Persistent master state is stored in etcd. Other components watch etcd for changes and eventually bring themselves into the desired state described in etcd.

=== Controller Manager Server

The controller manager server watches etcd for changes to replication controller objects and then uses the API to enforce the desired state.

== Node

Previously known as a minion, a node is a worker host in Kubernetes. Kubernetes validates the node with health checks and ignores it until these health checks are passed. Note that Kubernetes continues to check nodes until they are valid.

Note that kubernetes does not create nodes; rather, a node is instead created by your cloud provider, or from your physical or virtual machines. 

=== Kubelet

Each node has a kubelet that updates the node as specified by a container manifest; a YAML file that describes a pod. The kubelet uses a set of manifests to ensure that the containers described start and continue to run. A sample manifest can be found https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/containers/container_vms#container_manifest[here].

There are a number of ways that a container manifest can be provided to a kubelet:

* A file path on the command line. The file is checked every twenty seconds.
* A HTTP endpoint passed on the command line. The endpoint is checked every twenty seconds.
* The kubelet watches an etcd server, such as `[filename]#/registry/hosts/$(hostname -f)#`. Any changes are noticed and acted upon.
* The kubelet listens for HTTP and respond to a simple API to submit a new manifest.

=== Service Proxy

Each node also runs a simple network proxy. This reflects the services defined in the API on each node and can do simple TCP and UDP stream forwarding (round robin) across a set of backends.
