{cluster-manager-first} is a managed service where you can install, modify, operate, and upgrade your Red Hat OpenShift clusters. This service allows you to work with all of your organizationâ€™s clusters from a single dashboard.

{cluster-manager} guides you to install {OCP}, Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA), and {product-short-name} clusters. It is also responsible for managing both {OCP} clusters after self-installation as well as your ROSA and {product-short-name} clusters.

You can use {cluster-manager} to do the following actions:

* Create new clusters
* View cluster details and metrics
* Manage your clusters with tasks such as scaling, changing node labels, networking, authentication
* Manage access control
* Monitor clusters
* Schedule upgrades
