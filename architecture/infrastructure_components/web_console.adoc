== Overview
endif::openshift-origin,openshift-online,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
The {product-title} web console is a user interface accessible from a web browser.
Developers can use the web console to visualize, browse, and manage the contents
of xref:../core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#projects[projects].

[NOTE]
====
JavaScript must be enabled to use the web console. For the best experience, use
a web browser that supports
link:http://caniuse.com/#feat=websockets[WebSockets].
====

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
The web console is started as part of the
xref:kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master[master]. All static assets required
to run the web console are served from the `openshift` binary. Administrators
can also xref:../../install_config/web_console_customization.adoc#install-config-web-console-customization[customize the
web console] using extensions, which let you run scripts and load custom
stylesheets when the web console loads. You can change the look and feel of
nearly any aspect of the user interface in this way.

When you access the web console from a browser, it first loads all required
static assets. It then makes requests to the {product-title} APIs using
the values defined from the `openshift start` option
`--public-master`, or from the related
xref:../../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-configuration-files[master configuration file] parameter `masterPublicURL`.
The web console uses WebSockets to maintain a persistent connection with the API
server and receive updated information as soon as it is available.

.Web Console Request Architecture

The configured host names and IP addresses for the web console are whitelisted to access the
API server safely even when the browser would consider the requests to be link:http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/[cross-origin]. To access the API server from a web application using a different host name, you must
whitelist that host name by specifying the `--cors-allowed-origins` option
on `openshift start` or from the related
xref:../../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-configuration-files[master
configuration file parameter `corsAllowedOrigins`].
