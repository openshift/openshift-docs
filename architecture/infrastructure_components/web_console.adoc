== Overview
The OpenShift web console is a user interface accessible from a web browser.
Developers can use the web console to visualize, browse, and manage the contents
of link:../core_concepts/projects_and_users.html#projects[projects].

The web console is started as part of the
link:kubernetes_infrastructure.html#master[master]. All static assets required
to run the web console are served from the `openshift` binary.

When you access the web console from a browser, it first loads all required
static assets. It then makes requests to the OpenShift APIs using
the values defined from the `openshift start` option
`--public-master`, or from the related
link:../../admin_guide/master_node_configuration.html#master-configuration-files[master configuration file] parameter `masterPublicURL`.
The web console uses WebSockets to maintain a persistent connection with the API
server and receive updated information as soon as it is available.

[NOTE]
====
JavaScript must be enabled to use the web console. For the best experience, use
a web browser that supports
link:http://caniuse.com/#feat=websockets[WebSockets].

.Web Console Request Architecture

The configured host names and IP addresses for the web console are whitelisted to access the
API server safely even when the browser would consider the requests to be link:http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/[cross-origin]. To access the API server from a web application using a different host name, you must
whitelist that host name by specifying the `--cors-allowed-origins` option
on `openshift start` or from the related
link:../../admin_guide/master_node_configuration.html#master-configuration-files[master
configuration file parameter `corsAllowedOrigins`].

[[project-overviews]]

== Project Overviews
After link:../../dev_guide/authentication.html[logging in], the web console
provides developers with an overview for the currently selected
link:../../dev_guide/projects.html[project]:

====

.Web Console Project Overview
image::console_navigation.png["Web Console Project Overview"]
<1> The project selector allows you to
link:../../dev_guide/projects.html#view-projects[switch between projects] you
have access to.
<2> link:../../dev_guide/projects.html#filtering-by-labels[Filter] the contents
of a project page by using the
link:../core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#labels[labels] of a resource.
<3> Log out of the current user.
<4> Create new applications
link:../../dev_guide/new_app.html#using-the-web-console-na[using a source
repository] or
link:../../dev_guide/templates.html#using-the-web-console[using a
template].
<5> The *Overview* tab visualizes the contents of your project with a high-level
view of each component.
<6> The *Browse* tab explores the different
link:../core_concepts/overview.html[objects types] within your project:
link:../core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#builds[Builds],
link:../core_concepts/deployments.html[Deployments],
link:../core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#image-streams[Image
Streams],
link:../core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#pods[Pods], and
link:../core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services[Services].
<7> The *Settings* tab provides general information about your project, as well
as the link:../../dev_guide/quota.html[quota] and
link:../../dev_guide/limits.html[resource limits] that are set on your project.
<8> Visualization of the contents of your project.

For pods based on Java images, the web console also exposes access to a
http://hawt.io/[hawt.io]-based JVM console for viewing and managing any relevant
integration components. A *Connect* link is displayed in the pod's details on
the _Browse -> Pods_ page, provided the container has a port named *jolokia*.
