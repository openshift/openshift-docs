== Overview
The {product-title} web console is a user interface accessible from a web browser.
Developers can use the web console to visualize, browse, and manage the contents
of xref:../core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#projects[projects].

[NOTE]
====
JavaScript must be enabled to use the web console. For the best experience, use
a web browser that supports
link:http://caniuse.com/#feat=websockets[WebSockets].
====

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
The web console runs as a pod on the xref:kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master[master].
The static assets required to run the web console are served by the pod.
Administrators can also
xref:../../install_config/web_console_customization.adoc#install-config-web-console-customization[customize the web console]
using extensions, which let you run scripts and load custom stylesheets when
the web console loads.

When you access the web console from a browser, it first loads all required
static assets. It then makes requests to the {product-title} APIs using the
values defined from the `openshift start` option `--public-master`, or from the
related parameter `masterPublicURL` in the `webconsole-config` config map
defined in the `openshift-web-console` namespace. The web console uses
WebSockets to maintain a persistent connection with the API server and receive
updated information as soon as it is available.

[[corsAllowedOrigins]]
The configured host names and IP addresses for the web console are whitelisted to access the
API server safely even when the browser would consider the requests to be link:http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/[cross-origin].
To access the API server from a web application using a different host name, you must
whitelist that host name by specifying the `--cors-allowed-origins` option
on `openshift start` or from the related
xref:../../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-configuration-files[master
configuration file parameter `corsAllowedOrigins`].

The `corsAllowedOrigins` parameter is controlled by the configuration field. No
pinning or escaping is done to the value. The following is an example of how you
can pin a host name and escape dots:

----
corsAllowedOrigins:
- (?i)//my\.subdomain\.domain\.com(:|\z)
----

* The `(?i)` makes it case-insensitive.
* The `//` pins to the beginning of the domain (and matches the double slash
following `http:` or `https:`).
* The `\.` escapes dots in the domain name.
* The `(:|\z)` matches the end of the domain name `(\z)` or a port separator `(:)`.

[[web-console-cli-downloads]]
== CLI Downloads
You can access CLI downloads from the Help icon in the web console:

these links further].

== Project Overviews
After xref:../../dev_guide/authentication.adoc#dev-guide-authentication[logging in], the web console
provides developers with an overview for the currently selected

<4> Notifications related to your project.
<5> The *Overview* tab (currently selected) visualizes the contents of your
project with a high-level view of each component.
<6> *Applications* tab: Browse and perform actions on your deployments, pods, services, and routes.
<7> *Builds* tab: Browse and perform actions on your builds and image streams.
<8> *Resources* tab: View your current quota consumption and other resources.
<9> *Storage* tab: View persistent volume claims and request storage for your applications.
<10> *Monitoring* tab: View logs for builds, pods, and deployments, as well as
event notifications for all objects in your project.

[[jvm-console]]

== JVM Console

For pods based on Java images, the web console also exposes access to a
http://hawt.io/[hawt.io]-based JVM console for viewing and managing any relevant
integration components. A *Connect* link is displayed in the pod's details on
the _Browse -> Pods_ page, provided the container has a port named *jolokia*.

.Pod with a Link to the JVM Console

After connecting to the JVM console, different pages are displayed depending on
which components are relevant to the connected pod.

[[web-console-statefulsets]]
== StatefulSets

A `StatefulSet` controller provides a unique identity to its pods and determines
the order of deployments and scaling. `StatefulSet` is useful for unique network
identifiers, persistent storage, graceful deployment and scaling, and graceful
deletion and termination.
