== Overview
{product-title} can utilize any server implementing the Docker registry API as a
source of images, including the canonical Docker Hub, private registries run by
third parties, and the integrated {product-title} registry.

[[integrated-openshift-registry]]

== Integrated {product-title} Registry
{product-title} provides an integrated Docker registry that adds the ability to
provision new image repositories on the fly. This allows users to automatically
have a place for their
xref:../core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#builds[builds] to push the
resulting images.

Whenever a new image is pushed to the integrated registry, the registry notifies
{product-title} about the new image, passing along all the information about it,
such as the namespace, name, and image metadata. Different pieces of
{product-title} react to new images, creating new
xref:../core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#builds[builds] and
xref:../core_concepts/deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployments].

[[third-party-registries]]

== Third Party Registries
{product-title} can create containers using images from third party registries,
but it is unlikely that these registries offer the same image notification
support as the integrated {product-title} registry. In this situation
{product-title} will fetch tags from the remote registry upon imagestream
creation.  Refreshing the fetched tags is as simple as running `oc import-image
<stream>`. When new images are detected, the previously-described build and
deployment reactions occur.

[[authentication]]

=== Authentication
{product-title} can communicate with registries to access private image
repositories using credentials supplied by the user. This allows {product-title}
to push and pull images to and from private repositories. The
xref:../additional_concepts/authentication.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authentication[Authentication] topic has more
information.

ifdef::atomic-registry[]

{product-title} embeds the upstream link:https://github.com/docker/distribution[Docker distribution, role="external", window="_blank"]
library to maintain image format compatibility with Docker. New image
repositories may be created on the fly. Whenever a new image is pushed to the
integrated registry, the registry notifies {product-title} API about the new
image, passing along all the information about it, such as the namespace, name,
and image metadata.

{product-title} can reference images from external, third-party registries. During
import {product-title} will fetch tags from the remote registry and watch the
remote image tag for changes.
