== Overview
OpenShift can utilize any server implementing the Docker registry
API as a source of images, including the canonical Docker Hub, private
registries run by third parties, and the integrated OpenShift registry.

[[integrated-openshift-registry]]

== Integrated OpenShift Registry
OpenShift provides an integrated Docker registry that adds the ability to
provision new image repositories on the fly. This allows users to automatically
have a place for their
link:../core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#builds[builds] to push the
resulting images.

Whenever a new image is pushed to the integrated registry, the registry notifies
OpenShift about the new image, passing along all the information about it, such
as the namespace, name, and image metadata. Different pieces of OpenShift react
to new images, creating new
link:../core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#builds[builds] and
link:../core_concepts/deployments.html#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployments].

[[third-party-registries]]

== Third Party Registries
OpenShift can create containers using images from third party registries, but
it is unlikely that these registries offer the same image notification support
as the integrated OpenShift registry. In this situation OpenShift will fetch
tags from the remote registry upon imagestream creation.  Refreshing the
fetched tags is as simple as running `oc import-image <stream>`. When new
images are detected, the previously-described build and deployment reactions
occur.

To create an image stream from an external registry, set the
`spec.dockerImageRepository` field appropriately. For example:

----
{
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "kind": "ImageStream",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "ruby"
  },
  "spec": {
    "dockerImageRepository": "openshift/ruby-20-centos7"
  }
}
----

After OpenShift synchronizes the tag and image metadata, it looks something
like this:

----
{
  "kind": "ImageStream",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "ruby",
    "namespace": "default",
    "selfLink": "/osapi/v1/namespaces/default/imagestreams/ruby",
    "uid": "9990ea5f-f35a-11e4-937e-001c422dcd49",
    "resourceVersion": "53",
    "creationTimestamp": "2015-05-05T19:11:57Z",
    "annotations": {
      "openshift.io/image.dockerRepositoryCheck": "2015-05-05T19:12:00Z"
    }
  },
  "spec": {
    "dockerImageRepository": "openshift/ruby-20-centos7"
  },
  "status": {
    "dockerImageRepository": "openshift/ruby-20-centos7",
    "tags": [
      {
        "tag": "latest",
        "items": [
          {
            "created": "2015-05-05T19:11:58Z",
            "dockerImageReference": "openshift/ruby-20-centos7:latest",
            "image": "94439378e4546d72ef221c47fe2ac30065bcc3a98c25bc51bed77ec00efabb95"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "tag": "v0.4",
        "items": [
          {
            "created": "2015-05-05T19:11:59Z",
            "dockerImageReference": "openshift/ruby-20-centos7:v0.4",
            "image": "c7dbf059225847a7bfb4f40bc335ad7e70defc913de1a28aabea3a2072844a3f"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}

[NOTE]
====
Querying external registries to synchronize tag and image metadata is not
currently an automated process. To resynchronize manually, run
`oc import-image <stream>`. Within a short amount of time, OpenShift will
communicate with the external registry to get up to date information about the
Docker image repository associated with the image stream.
====

[[authentication]]

=== Authentication
OpenShift can communicate with registries to access private image repositories
using credentials supplied by the user. This allows OpenShift to push and pull
images to and from private repositories. The link:../additional_concepts/authentication.html[Authentication] topic
has more information.

{product-title} embeds the upstream link:https://github.com/docker/distribution[Docker distribution, role="external", window="_blank"]
library to maintain image format compatibility with Docker. New image
repositories may be created on the fly. Whenever a new image is pushed to the
integrated registry, the registry notifies {product-title} API about the new
image, passing along all the information about it, such as the namespace, name,
and image metadata.

{product-title} can reference images from external, third-party registries. During
import {product-title} will fetch tags from the remote registry and watch the
remote image tag for changes.
