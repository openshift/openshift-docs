== Overview
OpenShift utilizes any server implementing the Docker registry API as a source
of images, including the canonical Docker Hub, private registries run by third
parties, and the integrated OpenShift registry.

== Integrated OpenShift Registry
OpenShift provides an integrated Docker registry that adds the ability to
provision new image repositories on the fly (this feature is still a work in
progress). This allows users to automatically have a place for their builds to
push the resulting images.

Whenever a new image is pushed to the integrated registry, the registry notifies
OpenShift about the new image, passing along all the information about it, such
as the namespace, name, and image metadata. Different pieces of OpenShift react
to new images, creating new link:../core_objects/builds.html[builds] and
link:../../dev_guide/deployments.html[deployments].

== Third Party Registries
OpenShift can create containers using images from third party registries, but it
is unlikely that these registries offer the same image notification support as
the integrated OpenShift registry. If not, OpenShift can poll the other
registries for changes to image repositories. When new images are detected, the
same build and deployment reactions described above occur.

NOTE: Polling is not implemented yet.

=== Authentication
OpenShift can communicate with registries to access private image repositories
using credentials supplied by the user. This allows OpenShift to push and pull
images to and from private repositories.

See the link:../additional_concepts/authentication.html[Authentication] topic
for more information.
