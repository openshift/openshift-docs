== Overview
{product-title} can utilize any server implementing the Docker registry API as a
source of images, including the Docker Hub, private registries run by
third parties, and the integrated {product-title} registry.

[[integrated-openshift-registry]]
== Integrated OpenShift Container Registry

{product-title} provides an integrated container registry called _OpenShift
Container Registry_ (OCR) that adds the ability to automatically provision new image repositories on
demand. This provides users with a built-in location for their application xref:../core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#builds[builds] to push the
resulting images.

Whenever a new image is pushed to OCR, the registry notifies {product-title}
about the new image, passing along all the information about it, such as the
namespace, name, and image metadata. Different pieces of {product-title} react
to new images, creating new
xref:../core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#builds[builds] and
xref:../core_concepts/deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployments].

OCR can also be deployed as a stand-alone component that acts solely as a
container registry, without the build and deployment integration. See
xref:../../install/stand_alone_registry.adoc#install-config-installing-stand-alone-registry[Installing a Stand-alone Deployment of OpenShift Container Registry] for details.

[[third-party-registries]]

== Third Party Registries
{product-title} can create containers using images from third party registries,
but it is unlikely that these registries offer the same image notification
support as the integrated {product-title} registry. In this situation
{product-title} will fetch tags from the remote registry upon imagestream
creation.  Refreshing the fetched tags is as simple as running `oc import-image
<stream>`. When new images are detected, the previously-described build and
deployment reactions occur.

[[authentication]]

=== Authentication
{product-title} can communicate with registries to access private image
repositories using credentials supplied by the user. This allows {product-title}
to push and pull images to and from private repositories. The
xref:../additional_concepts/authentication.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authentication[Authentication] topic has more
information.
