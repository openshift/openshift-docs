== Overview
Within OpenShift, http://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes] manages containerized
applications across a set of containers or hosts and provides mechanisms for
deployment, maintenance, and application-scaling.
https://www.docker.com/[Docker] packages, instantiates, and runs containerized
applications.

A Kubernetes cluster consists of a master and a set of nodes.

[[master]]

== Master
The master is the host or hosts that contain the master components, including
the API server, controller manager server, and *etcd*. The master manages
link:#node[nodes] in its Kubernetes cluster and schedules
link:../core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#pods[pods] to run on nodes.

.Master Components
|===
|Component |Description

|API Server
|The Kubernetes API server validates and configures the data for pods, services,
and replication controllers. It also assigns pods to nodes and synchronizes pod
information with service configuration.

|*etcd*
|*etcd* stores the persistent master state while other components watch *etcd*
for changes to bring themselves into the desired state.

|Controller Manager Server
|The controller manager server watches *etcd* for changes to replication
controller objects and then uses the API to enforce the desired state.

[[node]]
== Node
A node provides the runtime environments for containers. Each node in a
Kubernetes cluster has the required services to be managed by the
link:#master[master]. Nodes also have the required services to run pods,
including Docker, a link:#kubelet[kubelet], and a link:#service-proxy[service
proxy].

OpenShift creates nodes from a cloud provider, physical systems, or virtual
systems. Kubernetes interacts with link:#node-object-definition[node objects]
that are a representation of those nodes. The master uses the information from
node objects to validate nodes with health checks. A node is ignored until it
passes the health checks, and the master continues checking nodes until they are
valid. The
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/node.md#node-management[Kubernetes documentation] has more information on node management.

Administrators can link:../../admin_guide/manage_nodes.html[manage nodes] in an
OpenShift instance using the CLI. To define full configuration and security
options when launching node servers, use
link:../../admin_guide/master_node_configuration.html[dedicated node
configuration files].

[[kubelet]]

=== Kubelet

Each node has a kubelet that updates the node as specified by a container
manifest, which is a YAML file that describes a pod. The kubelet uses a set of
manifests to ensure that its containers are started and that they
continue to run. A sample manifest can be found in the
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/containers/container_vms#container_manifest[Kubernetes
documentation].

A container manifest can be provided to a kubelet by:

- A file path on the command line that is checked every 20 seconds.
- An HTTP endpoint passed on the command line that is checked every 20 seconds.
- The kubelet watching an *etcd* server, such as *_/registry/hosts/$(hostname -f)_*, and acting on any changes.
- The kubelet listening for HTTP and responding to a simple API to submit a new
 manifest.

[[service-proxy]]

=== Service Proxy

Each node also runs a simple network proxy that reflects the services defined in
the API on that node. This allows the node to do simple TCP and UDP stream
forwarding across a set of back ends.

[[node-object-definition]]

=== Node Object Definition

The following is an example node object definition in Kubernetes:

====

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1 <1>
kind: Node <2>
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels: <3>
    kubernetes.io/hostname: node1.example.com
  name: node1.example.com <4>
spec:
  externalID: node1.example.com <5>
status:
  nodeInfo:
    bootID: ""
    containerRuntimeVersion: ""
    kernelVersion: ""
    kubeProxyVersion: ""
    kubeletVersion: ""
    machineID: ""
    osImage: ""
    systemUUID: ""
----

<1> *`apiVersion`* defines the API version to use.
<2> *`kind`* set to `Node` identifies this as a definition for a node
object.
<3> *`metadata.labels`* lists any
link:../core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#labels[labels] that have been added
to the node.
<4> *`metadata.name`* is a required value that defines the name of the node
object. This value is shown in the `NAME` column when running the `oc get nodes`
command.
<5> *`spec.externalID`* defines the fully-qualified domain name where the node
can be reached. Defaults to the *`metadata.name`* value when empty.
====

The link:../../rest_api/kubernetes_v1.html#v1-node[REST API Reference] has
more details on these definitions.
