== Overview
Within {product-title}, Kubernetes manages containerized applications across a
set of containers or hosts and provides mechanisms for deployment, maintenance,
and application-scaling. The Docker service packages, instantiates, and runs
containerized applications. A Kubernetes cluster consists of one or more masters and a set of nodes.

You can optionally configure your masters for
xref:high-availability-masters[high availability] (HA) to ensure that the
cluster has no single point of failure.

uses Kubernetes 1.9 and Docker 1.13.

[[master]]

== Masters
The master is the host or hosts that contain the master components, including
the API server, controller manager server, and etcd. The master manages
xref:node[nodes] in its Kubernetes cluster and schedules
xref:../core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#pods[pods] to run on nodes.

[cols="1,4"]
.Master Components
|===
|Component |Description

|API Server
|The Kubernetes API server validates and configures the data for pods, services,
and replication controllers. It also assigns pods to nodes and synchronizes pod
information with service configuration. Can be run as a standalone process.

|etcd
|etcd stores the persistent master state while other components watch etcd
for changes to bring themselves into the desired state. etcd can be optionally
configured for high availability, typically deployed with 2n+1 peer services.

|Controller Manager Server
|The controller manager server watches etcd for changes to replication
controller objects and then uses the API to enforce the desired state.
Can be run as a standalone process. Several such processes create a cluster with
one active leader at a time.

|HAProxy
a|Optional, used when configuring
xref:high-availability-masters[highly-available masters] with the `native`
method to balance load between API master endpoints.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
The xref:../../install/index.adoc#install-planning[cluster installation process]
can configure HAProxy for you with the `native` method. Alternatively, you can
use the `native` method but pre-configure your own load balancer of choice.

[[high-availability-masters]]

=== High Availability Masters

While in a single master configuration, the availability of running applications
remains if the master or any of its services fail. However, failure of master
services reduces the ability of the system to respond to application failures or
creation of new applications.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
You can optionally configure your masters for high
availability (HA) to ensure that the cluster has no single point of failure.

To mitigate concerns about availability of the master, two activities are
recommended:

1. A https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runbook[runbook] entry should be created for
reconstructing the master. A runbook entry is a necessary backstop for any
highly-available service. Additional solutions merely control the frequency
that the runbook must be consulted. For example, a cold standby of the master
host can adequately fulfill SLAs that require no more than minutes of downtime
for creation of new applications or recovery of failed application components.

2. Use a high availability solution to configure your masters and ensure that the
cluster has no single point of failure. The
xref:../../install/example_inventories.adoc#multiple-masters[cluster
installation documentation] provides specific examples using the `native` HA method and
configuring HAProxy. You can also take the concepts and apply them towards your
existing HA solutions using the `native` method instead of HAProxy.

[NOTE]
====
Moving from a single master cluster to multiple masters after installation is
not supported.

When using the `native` HA method with HAProxy, master components have the
following availability:

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
While clustered etcd requires an odd number of hosts for quorum, the master
services have no quorum or requirement that they have an odd number of hosts.
However, since you need at least two master services for HA, it is common to
maintain a uniform odd number of hosts when collocating master services and
etcd.
endif::[]

[[node]]

== Nodes
A node provides the runtime environments for containers. Each node in a
Kubernetes cluster has the required services to be managed by the
xref:master[master]. Nodes also have the required services to run pods,
including the Docker service, a xref:kubelet[kubelet], and a xref:service-proxy[service proxy].

{product-title} creates nodes from a cloud provider, physical systems, or virtual
systems. Kubernetes interacts with xref:node-object-definition[node objects]
that are a representation of those nodes. The master uses the information from
node objects to validate nodes with health checks. A node is ignored until it
passes the health checks, and the master continues checking nodes until they are
valid. The link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/#management[Kubernetes documentation] has more information on node management.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
Administrators can xref:../../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#admin-guide-manage-nodes[manage nodes] in an
{product-title} instance using the CLI. To define full configuration and security
options when launching node servers, use
xref:../../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#install-config-master-node-configuration[dedicated node
configuration files].

[IMPORTANT]
====
See the
xref:../../scaling_performance/cluster_limits.adoc#scaling-performance-cluster-limits[cluster
limits] section for the recommended maximum number of nodes.

[[kubelet]]

=== Kubelet

Each node has a kubelet that updates the node as specified by a container
manifest, which is a YAML file that describes a pod. The kubelet uses a set of
manifests to ensure that its containers are started and that they
continue to run.

A container manifest can be provided to a kubelet by:

- A file path on the command line that is checked every 20 seconds.
- An HTTP endpoint passed on the command line that is checked every 20 seconds.
- The kubelet watching an etcd server, such as *_/registry/hosts/$(hostname -f)_*, and acting on any changes.
- The kubelet listening for HTTP and responding to a simple API to submit a new
 manifest.

[[service-proxy]]

=== Service Proxy

Each node also runs a simple network proxy that reflects the services defined in
the API on that node. This allows the node to do simple TCP and UDP stream
forwarding across a set of back ends.

[[node-object-definition]]

=== Node Object Definition

The following is an example node object definition in Kubernetes:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1 <1>
kind: Node <2>
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels: <3>
    kubernetes.io/hostname: node1.example.com
  name: node1.example.com <4>
spec:
  externalID: node1.example.com <5>
status:
  nodeInfo:
    bootID: ""
    containerRuntimeVersion: ""
    kernelVersion: ""
    kubeProxyVersion: ""
    kubeletVersion: ""
    machineID: ""
    osImage: ""
    systemUUID: ""
----
<1> `apiVersion` defines the API version to use.
<2> `kind` set to `Node` identifies this as a definition for a node
object.
<3> `metadata.labels` lists any
xref:../core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[labels] that have been added
to the node.
<4> `metadata.name` is a required value that defines the name of the node
object. This value is shown in the `NAME` column when running the `oc get nodes`
command.
<5> `spec.externalID` defines the fully-qualified domain name where the node
can be reached. Defaults to the `metadata.name` value when empty.
