= Installation and update

In {product-title} version 4.0, you can install only clusters that use
Installer Provisioned Infrastructure in Amazon Web Services (AWS).
These clusters use {op-system-first}
nodes as the operating system. Future versions of {product-title} will support
clusters that use both Installer Provisioned Infrastructure
and User Provisioned Infrastructure on more cloud providers and on bare metal.
With all cluster types, you must use {op-system} as the operating system for
control plane nodes.
////
If you want to
use any other cloud or install your cluster on-premise, use the bring your own
infrastructure option to install your cluster on existing Red Hat Enterprise
Linux (RHEL) hosts.
////

Using Installer Provisioned Infrastructure offers full-stack automation to:

* Manage compute
* Manage operating system ({op-system})
* Manage control plane
* Manage nodes

////
With the bring your own infrastructure option, you have more responsibilities.
You must provide the hosts and update RHEL on them. {product-title} provides:

* Managed control plane
* Ansible to manage kubelet and container runtime
////

Installation and upgrade both use an Operator
that constantly reconciles component versions as if it were any other Kubernetes
controller.
