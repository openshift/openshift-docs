The following topics provide high-level, architectural information on core
concepts and objects you will encounter when using OpenShift. Many of these
objects come from Kubernetes, which is extended by OpenShift to provide
a more feature-rich development lifecycle platform.

- link:containers_and_images.html[Containers and images] are the building blocks
for deploying your applications.
- link:pods_and_services.html[Pods and services] allow for containers to
communicate with each other and proxy connections.
- link:projects_and_users.html[Projects and users] provide the space and means
for communities to organize and manage their content together.
- link:builds_and_image_streams.html[Builds and image streams] allow you to
build working images and react to new images.
- link:deployments.html[Deployments] add expanded support for the software
development and deployment lifecycle.
- link:routes.html[Routes] announce your service to the world.
