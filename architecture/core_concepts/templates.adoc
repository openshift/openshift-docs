[[overview]]

== Overview
A template describes a set of xref:index.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-index[objects] that
can be parameterized and processed to produce a list of objects
for creation by {product-title}. The objects to create can include
anything that users have permission to create within a project,
for example xref:pods_and_services.adoc#services[services],
xref:builds_and_image_streams.adoc#builds[build configurations], and
xref:deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configurations]. A template may also define a set of
xref:pods_and_services.adoc#labels[labels] to apply to every object
defined in the template.

See the xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[template guide] for details about creating and using templates.
