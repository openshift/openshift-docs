== Overview

An {product-title} route exposes a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[service] at a
host name, like _www.example.com_, so that external clients can reach it by
name.

DNS resolution for a host name is handled separately from routing.
Your administrator may have configured a
ifdef::openshift-online,openshift-dedicated[]
DNS wildcard entry
endif::[]
ifndef::openshift-online+openshift-dedicated[]
xref:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.adoc#prereq-dns[DNS wildcard entry]
endif::[]
that will resolve to the {product-title} node that is running the
{product-title} router. If you are using a different host name you may
need to modify its DNS records independently to resolve to the node that
is running the router.

Each route consists of a name (limited to 63 characters), a service selector,
and an optional security configuration.

[[routers]]
== Routers

An {product-title} administrator can deploy _routers_ to nodes in an
{product-title} cluster, which enable routes
xref:../../dev_guide/routes.adoc#creating-routes[created by developers] to be
used by external clients. The routing layer in {product-title} is pluggable, and
two available xref:available-router-plug-ins[router plug-ins] are provided and
supported by default.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
[NOTE]
====
See the xref:../../install_config/router/index.adoc#install-config-router-overview[Installation and
Configuration] guide for information on deploying a router.
====
endif::[]

A router uses the service selector to find the
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[service] and the endpoints backing
the service.
When both router and service provide load balancing,
{product-title} uses the router load balancing.
A router detects relevant changes in the IP addresses of its services
and adapts its configuration accordingly.
This is useful for custom routers to communicate modifications
of API objects to an external routing solution.

The path of a request starts with the DNS resolution of a host name
to one or more routers.
The suggested method is to define a cloud domain with
a wildcard DNS entry pointing to one or more virtual IP (VIP)
addresses backed by multiple router instances.
Routes using names and addresses outside the cloud domain require
configuration of individual DNS entries.

When there are fewer VIP addresses than routers, the routers corresponding
to the number of addresses are _active_ and the rest are _passive_.
A passive router is also known as a _hot-standby_ router.
For example, with two VIP addresses and three routers,
you have an "active-active-passive" configuration.
See
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]

endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
the xref:../../admin_guide/high_availability.adoc#configuring-a-highly-available-service[{product-title} Cluster Administration documentation]
endif::[]
for more information on router VIP configuration.

Routes can be
xref:router-sharding[sharded]
among the set of routers.
Administrators can set up sharding on a cluster-wide basis
and users can set up sharding for the namespace in their project.
Sharding allows the operator to define multiple router groups.
Each router in the group serves only a subset of traffic.

{product-title} routers provide external host name mapping and load balancing
of xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[service] end points over protocols that
pass distinguishing information directly to the router; the host name
must be present in the protocol in order for the router to determine
where to send it.

Router plug-ins assume they can bind to host ports 80 (HTTP)
and 443 (HTTPS), by default.
This means that routers must be placed on nodes
where those ports are not otherwise in use.
Alternatively, a router can be configured to listen
on other ports by setting the `ROUTER_SERVICE_HTTP_PORT`
and `ROUTER_SERVICE_HTTPS_PORT` environment variables.

Because a router binds to ports on the host node,
only one router listening on those ports can be on each node
if the router uses host networking (the default).
Cluster networking is configured such that all routers
can access all pods in the cluster.

Routers support the following protocols:

- HTTP
- HTTPS (with SNI)
- WebSockets
- TLS with SNI

[NOTE]
====
WebSocket traffic uses the same route conventions and supports the same TLS
termination types as other traffic.
====

For a secure connection to be established, a xref:ciphers[cipher] common to the
client and server must be negotiated. As time goes on, new, more secure ciphers
become available and are integrated into client software. As older clients
become obsolete, the older, less secure ciphers can be dropped. By default, the
router supports a broad range of commonly available clients. The router can be
configured to use a selected set of ciphers that support desired clients and
do not include the less secure ciphers.

[[routes-template-routers]]

=== Template Routers

A _template router_ is a type of router that provides certain infrastructure
information to the underlying router implementation, such as:

- A wrapper that watches endpoints and routes.
- Endpoint and route data, which is saved into a consumable form.
- Passing the internal state to a configurable template and executing the
template.
- Calling a reload script.

[[available-router-plug-ins]]

== Available Router Plug-ins

The following router plug-ins are provided and supported in {product-title}.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
Instructions on deploying these routers are available in
xref:../../install_config/router/index.adoc#install-config-router-overview[Deploying a Router].
endif::[]

[[haproxy-template-router]]

=== HAProxy Template Router

The HAProxy template router implementation is the reference implementation for a
template router plug-in. It uses the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
*openshift3/ose-haproxy-router*
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*openshift/origin-haproxy-router*
endif::[]
repository to run an HAProxy instance alongside the template router plug-in.

The following diagram illustrates how data flows from the master through the
plug-in and finally into an HAProxy configuration:

.HAProxy Router Data Flow
image::router_model.png[HAProxy Router Data Flow]

[[routes-sticky-sessions]]
=== Sticky Sessions

Sticky sessions ensure that all traffic from a user's session go to the same
pod, creating a better user experience. While satisfying the user's requests,
the pod caches data, which can be used in subsequent requests. For example, for
a cluster with five back-end pods and two load-balanced routers, you can ensure
that the same pod receives the web traffic from the same web browser regardless
of the router that handles it.

While returning routing traffic to the same pod is desired, it cannot be
guaranteed. However, you can use HTTP headers to set a cookie to determine the
pod used in the last connection. When the user sends another request to the
application the browser re-sends the cookie and the router knows where to send
the traffic.

Cluster administrators can turn off stickiness for passthrough routes separately
from other connections, or turn off stickiness entirely.

By default, sticky sessions for passthrough routes are implemented using the
`source` xref:load-balancing[load balancing strategy]. The default can be
changed for all passthrough routes by using the `ROUTER_TCP_BALANCE_SCHEME`
xref:env-variables[environment variable], and for individual routes by using the
`*haproxy.router.openshift.io/balance*` xref:route-specific-annotations[route
specific annotation].

Other types of routes use the `leastconn` xref:load-balancing[load balancing
strategy] by default, which can be changed by using the
`ROUTER_LOAD_BALANCE_ALGORITHM` xref:env-variables[environment variable]. It
can be changed for individual routes by using the
`*haproxy.router.openshift.io/balance*` xref:route-specific-annotations[route
specific annotation].


[NOTE]
====
Cookies cannot be set on passthrough routes, because the HTTP traffic cannot be
seen. Instead, a number is calculated based on the source IP address, which
determines the back-end.

If back-ends change, the traffic could head to the wrong server, making it less
sticky, and if you are using a load-balancer (which hides the source IP) the
same number is set for all connections and traffic is sent to the same pod.
====

In addition, the template
router plug-in provides the service name and namespace to the underlying
implementation. This can be used for more advanced configuration such as
implementing stick-tables that synchronize between a set of peers.

Specific configuration for this router implementation is stored in the
*_haproxy-config.template_* file located in the *_/var/lib/haproxy/conf_*
directory of the router container. The file may be
xref:../../install_config/router/customized_haproxy_router.adoc#[customized].

[NOTE]
====
The `source` xref:load-balancing[load balancing strategy] does not distinguish
between external client IP
addresses; because of the NAT configuration, the originating IP address
(HAProxy remote) is the same. Unless the HAProxy router is running with
`*hostNetwork: true*`, all external clients will be routed to a single pod.
====

[[env-variables]]
== Router Environment Variables

For all the items outlined in this section, you can set environment variables in
the *deployment config* for the router to alter its configuration, or use the
`oc set env` command:

----
$ oc set env <object_type>/<object_name> KEY1=VALUE1 KEY2=VALUE2
----

For example:

----
$ oc set env dc/router ROUTER_SYSLOG_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1 ROUTER_LOG_LEVEL=debug
----

|===

[NOTE]
====
If you want to run multiple routers on the same machine, you must change the
ports that the router is listening on, `ROUTER_SERVICE_SNI_PORT` and
`ROUTER_SERVICE_NO_SNI_PORT`. These ports can be anything you want as long as
they are unique on the machine. These ports will not be exposed externally.
====

[[time-units]]
== Timeouts
`TimeUnits` are represented by a number followed by the unit: `us`
*(microseconds), `ms` (milliseconds, default), `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h`
*(hours), `d` (days).

The regular expression is: [1-9][0-9]*(us\|ms\|s\|m\|h\|d)

[[load-balancing]]
== Load-balancing Strategy

When a route has multiple endpoints, HAProxy distributes requests to the route
among the endpoints based on the selected load-balancing strategy. This applies
when no xref:routes-sticky-sessions[persistence information] is available, such
as on the first request in a session.

The strategy can be one of the following:

- `*roundrobin*`: Each endpoint is used in turn, according to its weight.
This is the smoothest and fairest algorithm when the server's
processing time remains equally distributed.
- `*leastconn*`: The endpoint with the lowest number of connections receives the
request. Round-robin is performed when multiple endpoints have the same lowest
number of connections. Use this algorithm when very long sessions are
expected, such as LDAP, SQL, TSE, or others. Not intended to be used
with protocols that typically use short sessions such as HTTP.
- `*source*`: The source IP address is hashed and divided by the total
weight of the running servers to designate which server will
receive the request. This ensures that the same client IP
address will always reach the same server as long as no
server goes down or up. If the hash result changes due to the
number of running servers changing, many clients will be
directed to different servers. This algorithm is generally
used with xref:routes-sticky-sessions[passthrough routes].

The `ROUTER_TCP_BALANCE_SCHEME` xref:env-variables[environment variable] sets the default
strategy for passthorugh routes. The `ROUTER_LOAD_BALANCE_ALGORITHM` xref:env-variables[environment
variable] sets the default strategy for the router for the remaining routes.
A xref:route-specific-annotations[route specific annotation],
`*haproxy.router.openshift.io/balance*`, can be used to control specific routes.

[[strict-sni]]
== HAProxy Strict SNI

By default, when a host does not resolve to a route in a HTTPS or TLS SNI
request, the default certificate is returned to the caller as part of the *503*
response. This exposes the default certificate and can pose security concerns
because the wrong certificate is served for a site. The HAProxy `strict-sni`
option to bind suppresses use of the default certificate.

The `ROUTER_STRICT_SNI` environment variable controls bind processing. When set
to `true` or `TRUE`, `strict-sni` is added to the HAProxy bind. The default
setting is `false`.

The option can be set when the router is created or added later.

----
$ oc adm router --strict-sni
----

This sets `ROUTER_STRICT_SNI=true`.

[[ciphers]]
== Router Cipher Suite

Each client (for example, Chrome 30, or Java8) includes a suite of ciphers used
to securely connect with the router. The router must have at least one of the
ciphers for the connection to be complete:

.Router Cipher Profiles
[cols="2,6", options="header"]
|===
|Profile | Oldest compatible client
|modern| Firefox 27, Chrome 30, IE 11 on Windows 7, Edge, Opera 17, Safari 9, Android 5.0, Java 8
|intermediate|Firefox 1, Chrome 1, IE 7, Opera 5, Safari 1, Windows XP IE8, Android 2.3, Java 7
|old|Windows XP IE6, Java 6
|===

See the link:https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS[Security/Server
Side TLS] reference guide for more information.

The router defaults to the `intermediate` profile. You can select a different
profile using the `--ciphers` option when creating a route, or by changing
the `ROUTER_CIPHERS` environment variable with the values `modern`,
`intermediate`, or `old` for an existing router. Alternatively, a set of ":"
separated ciphers can be provided. The ciphers must be from the set displayed
by:

----
openssl ciphers
----

[[route-hostnames]]

== Route Host Names
In order for services to be exposed externally, an {product-title} route allows
you to associate a service with an externally-reachable host name. This edge
host name is then used to route traffic to the service.

When multiple routes from different namespaces claim the same host,
the oldest route wins and claims it for the namespace. If additional
routes with different path fields are defined in the same namespace,
those paths are added. If multiple routes with the same path are
used, the oldest takes priority.

A consequence of this behavior is that if you have two routes for a host name: an
older one and a newer one. If someone else has a route for the same host name
that they created between when you created the other two routes, then if you
delete your older route, your claim to the host name will no longer be in effect.
The other namespace now claims the host name and your claim is lost.

.A Route with a Specified Host:

If a host name is not provided as part of the route definition, then
{product-title} automatically generates one for you. The generated host name
is of the form:

----
<route-name>[-<namespace>].<suffix>
----

The following example shows the {product-title}-generated host name for the
above configuration of a route without a host added to a namespace
*mynamespace*:

[[route-types]]
== Route Types
Routes can be either secured or unsecured. Secure routes provide the ability to
use several types of TLS termination to serve certificates to the client.
Routers support xref:edge-termination[edge],
xref:passthrough-termination[passthrough], and
xref:re-encryption-termination[re-encryption] termination.

----

====

Unsecured routes are simplest to configure, as they require no key
or certificates, but secured routes offer security for connections to
remain private.

A secured route is one that specifies the TLS termination of the route.
The available types of termination are xref:secured-routes[described
below].

[[path-based-routes]]
== Path Based Routes
Path based routes specify a path component that can be compared against
a URL (which requires that the traffic for the route be HTTP based) such
that multiple routes can be served using the same host name, each with a
different path. Routers should match routes based on the most specific
path to the least; however, this depends on the router implementation. The
following table shows example routes and their accessibility:

.Route Availability

----

<1> The path is the only added attribute for a path-based route.
====

[NOTE]
====
Path-based routing is not available when using passthrough TLS, as
the router does not terminate TLS in that case and cannot read the contents
of the request.
====

[[secured-routes]]
== Secured Routes
Secured routes specify the TLS termination of the route and, optionally,
provide a key and certificate(s).

[NOTE]
====
TLS termination in {product-title} relies on
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication[SNI] for serving
custom certificates. Any non-SNI traffic received on port 443 is handled with
TLS termination and a default certificate (which may not match the requested
host name, resulting in validation errors).
====

Secured routes can use any of the following three types of secure TLS
termination.

[[edge-termination]]
*Edge Termination*

With edge termination, TLS termination occurs at the router, prior to proxying
traffic to its destination. TLS certificates are served by the front end of the
router, so they must be configured into the route, otherwise the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
xref:../../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#using-wildcard-certificates[router's
default certificate]
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]

endif::[]
will be used for TLS termination.

<2> The `*termination*` field is `edge` for edge termination.
<3> The `*key*` field is the contents of the PEM format key file.
<4> The `*certificate*` field is the contents of the PEM format certificate file.
<5> An optional CA certificate may be required to establish a certificate chain for validation.
====

Because TLS is terminated at the router, connections from the router to
the endpoints over the internal network are not encrypted.

Edge-terminated routes can specify an `insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy` that
enables traffic on insecure schemes (`HTTP`) to be disabled, allowed or
redirected.
The allowed values for `insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy` are:
  `None` or empty (for disabled), `Allow` or `Redirect`.
The default `insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy` is to disable traffic on the
insecure scheme. A common use case is to allow content to be served via a
secure scheme but serve the assets (example images, stylesheets and
javascript) via the insecure scheme.

[[passthrough-termination]]
*Passthrough Termination*

With passthrough termination, encrypted traffic is sent straight to the
destination without the router providing TLS termination. Therefore no
key or certificate is required.

The destination pod is responsible for serving certificates for the
traffic at the endpoint. This is currently the only method that can support
requiring client certificates (also known as two-way authentication).

[NOTE]
====
Passthrough routes can also have an `insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy`. The only
valid values are `None` (or empty, for disabled) or `Redirect`.
====

[[re-encryption-termination]]
*Re-encryption Termination*

Re-encryption is a variation on edge termination where the router terminates
TLS with a certificate, then re-encrypts its connection to the endpoint which
may have a different certificate. Therefore the full path of the connection
is encrypted, even over the internal network. The router uses health
checks to determine the authenticity of the host.

<2> The `*termination*` field is set to `reencrypt`. Other fields are as in edge

<3> Required for re-encryption. `*destinationCACertificate*`
specifies a CA certificate to validate the endpoint certificate, securing the
connection from the router to the destination pods. If the service is using a service signing certificate, or the administrator has specified a default CA certificate for the router and the service has a certificate signed by that CA, this field can be omitted.
====

If the `*destinationCACertificate*` field is left empty, the router
automatically leverages the certificate authority that is generated for service
serving certificates, and is injected into every pod as
`/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-ca.crt`. This allows new
routes that leverage end-to-end encryption without having to generate a
certificate for the route. This is useful for custom routers or the F5 router,
which might not allow the `destinationCACertificate` unless the administrator
has allowed it.

[NOTE]
====
Re-encrypt routes can have an `insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy` with all of the
same values as edge-terminated routes.
====

[[router-sharding]]
== Router Sharding

In {product-title}, each route can have any number of
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[labels]
in its `metadata` field.
A router uses _selectors_ (also known as a _selection expression_)
to select a subset of routes from the entire pool of routes to serve.
A selection expression can also involve
labels on the route's namespace.
The selected routes form a _router shard_.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
You can
xref:../../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#creating-router-shards[create]
and
xref:../../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#modifying-router-shards[modify]
router shards independently from the routes, themselves.
endif::[]

This design supports _traditional_ sharding as well as _overlapped_ sharding.
In traditional sharding, the selection results in no overlapping sets
and a route belongs to exactly one shard.
In overlapped sharding, the selection results in overlapping sets
and a route can belong to many different shards.
For example, a single route may belong to a `SLA=high` shard
(but not `SLA=medium` or `SLA=low` shards),
as well as a `geo=west` shard
(but not a `geo=east` shard).

Another example of overlapped sharding is a
set of routers that select based on namespace of the route:

[cols="1,1,3",options="header"]
|===
| Router | Selection | Namespaces

|router-1
|`A*` -- `J*`
|`A*`, `B*`, `C*`, `D*`, `E*`, `F*`, `G*`, `H*`, `I*`, `J*`

|router-2
|`K*` -- `T*`
|`K*`, `L*`, `M*`, `N*`, `O*`, `P*`, `Q*`, `R*`, `S*`, `T*`

|router-3
|`Q*` -- `Z*`
|`Q*`, `R*`, `S*`, `T*`, `U*`, `V*`, `W*`, `X*`, `Y*`, `Z*`
|===

Both `router-2` and `router-3` serve routes that are in the
namespaces `Q*`, `R*`, `S*`, `T*`.
To change this example from overlapped to traditional sharding,
we could change the selection of `router-2` to `K*` -- `P*`,
which would eliminate the overlap.

When routers are sharded,
a given route is bound to zero or more routers in the group.
The route binding ensures uniqueness of the route across the shard.
Uniqueness allows secure and non-secure versions of the same route to exist
within a single shard.
This implies that routes now have a visible life cycle
that moves from created to bound to active.

In the sharded environment the first route to hit the shard
reserves the right to exist there indefinitely, even across restarts.

During a green/blue deployment a route may be be selected in multiple routers.
An {product-title} application administrator may wish to bleed traffic from one
version of the application to another and then turn off the old version.

Sharding can be done by the administrator at a cluster level and by the user
at a project/namespace level.
When namespace labels are used, the service account for the router
must have `cluster-reader` permission to permit the
router to access the labels in the namespace.


[NOTE]
====
For two or more routes that claim the same host name, the resolution order
is based on the age of the route and the oldest route would win the claim to
that host.
In the case of sharded routers, routes are selected based on their labels
matching the router's selection criteria. There is no consistent way to
determine when labels are added to a route. So if an older route claiming
an existing host name is "re-labelled" to match the router's selection
criteria, it will replace the existing route based on the above mentioned
resolution order (oldest route wins).
====

[[alternateBackends]]
== Alternate Backends and Weights

A route is usually associated with one service through the `to:` token with `kind: Service`.
All of the requests to the route are handled by endpoints in the service based on the
xref:load-balancing[load balancing strategy].

It is possible to have as many as four services supporting the route. The portion of 
requests that are handled by each service is governed by the service `weight`.

The first service is entered using the `to:` token as before, and up to three additional
services can be entered using the `alternateBackend:` token. Each service must be
`kind: Service` which is the default.

Each service can have a `weight` associated with it. The portion of requests handled 
by the service is `weight` / `sum_of_all_weights`. When a service has more than one 
endpoint, the service's weight is distributed among the endpoints with each endpoint
getting at least 1. If the service `weight` is 0 each endpoint will get 0.

The `weight` must be in the range 0-256. The default is 1.
When the `weight` is 0 no requests are passed to the service. If all services have
`weight` 0, requests are returned with a 503 error. 

When using `alternateBackends` also use the `roundrobin` xref:load-balancing[load balancing strategy]
to ensure requests are distributed as expected to the services based on `weight`.
`roundrobin` can be set for a route using a xref:route-specific-annotations[route annotation],
or for the router in general using an xref:env-variables[environment variable].

The following is an example route configuration using alternate backends for
xref:../../dev_guide/deployments/advanced_deployment_strategies.adoc#advanced-deployment-a-b-deployment[A/B deployments].

.A Route with alternateBackends and weights:

----

<2> The first service name is `service-name` which may have 0 or more pods
<3> The alternateBackend services may also have 0 or more pods
<4> The total `weight` is 40. `service-name` will get 20/40 or 1/2 of the requests,
`service-name2` and `service-name3` will each get 1/4 of the requests.


[[route-specific-annotations]]
== Route-specific Annotations

Using xref:env-variables[environment variables], a router can set the default
options for all the routes it exposes. An individual route can override some
of these defaults by providing specific configurations in its annotations.

*Route Annotations*

For all the items outlined in this section, you can set annotations on the
*route definition* for the route to alter its configuration

.Route Annotations
[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
|Variable | Description | Environment Variable Used as Default
|`*haproxy.router.openshift.io/balance*`| Sets the xref:load-balancing[load-balancing algorithm]. Available options are `source`, `roundrobin`, and `leastconn`. | `ROUTER_TCP_BALANCE_SCHEME` for passthrough routes. Otherwise, use `ROUTER_LOAD_BALANCE_ALGORITHM`.
|`*haproxy.router.openshift.io/disable_cookies*`| Disables the use of cookies to track related connections. If set to `true` or `TRUE`, the balance algorithm is used to choose which back-end serves connections for each incoming HTTP request. |
|`*haproxy.router.openshift.io/rate-limit-connections*`| Setting `true` or `TRUE` to enables rate limiting functionality. |
|`*haproxy.router.openshift.io/rate-limit-connections.concurrent-tcp*`| Limits the number of concurrent TCP connections shared by an IP address. |

WebSocket connections to timeout frequently on that route.
====

[[whitelist]]
== Route-specific IP Whitelists

You can restrict access to a route to a select set of IP addresses by adding the
`haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist` annotation on the route. The
whitelist is a space-separated list of IP addresses and/or CIDRs for the
approved source addresses. Requests from IP addresses that are not in the
whitelist are dropped.

Some examples:

When editing a route, add the following annotation to define the desired
source IP's. Alternatively, use `oc annotate route <name>`.

Allow only one specific IP address:

----
metadata:
  annotations:
    haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist: 192.168.1.10
----

Allow several IP addresses:

----
metadata:

[[wildcard-subdomain-route-policy]]
== Creating Routes Specifying a Wildcard Subdomain Policy

A wildcard policy allows a user to define a route that covers all hosts within a
domain (when the router is configured to allow it). A route can specify a
wildcard policy as part of its configuration using the `wildcardPolicy` field.
Any routers run with a policy allowing wildcard routes will expose the route
appropriately based on the wildcard policy.

xref:../../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#using-wildcard-routes[Learn how to configure HAProxy routers to allow wildcard routes].

kind: Route
spec:
  host: wildcard.example.com  <1>
  wildcardPolicy: Subdomain   <2>
  to:
    kind: Service

----

<2> Specifies that the externally reachable host name should allow all hosts
    in the subdomain `example.com`. `*.example.com` is the subdomain for host
    name `wildcard.example.com` to reach the exposed service.
====

[[route-status-field]]
== Route Status

The `route status` field is only set by routers. If changes are made to a route
so that a router no longer serves a specific route, the status becomes stale.
The routers do not clear the `route status` field. To remove the stale entries
in the route status, use the
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/images/router/clear-route-status.sh[clear-route-status
script].


[[architecture-core-concepts-routes-deny-allow]]
== Denying or Allowing Certain Domains in Routes

A router can be configured to deny or allow a specific subset of domains from
the host names in a route using the `ROUTER_DENIED_DOMAINS` and
`ROUTER_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` environment variables.

[cols="2"]
|===

|`ROUTER_DENIED_DOMAINS` | Domains listed are not allowed in any indicated routes.
|`ROUTER_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` | Only the domains listed are allowed in any indicated routes.

|===

The domains in the list of denied domains take precedence over the list of
allowed domains. Meaning {product-title} first checks the deny list (if
applicable), and if the host name is not in the list of denied domains, it then
checks the list of allowed domains. However, the list of allowed domains is more
restrictive, and ensures that the router only admits routes with hosts that
belong to that list.

For example, to deny the `[{asterisk}.]open.header.test`, `[{asterisk}.]openshift.org` and
`[{asterisk}.]block.it` routes for the `myrouter` route:

----
$ oc adm router myrouter ...
$ oc set env dc/myrouter ROUTER_DENIED_DOMAINS="open.header.test, openshift.org, block.it"
----

This means that `myrouter` will admit the following based on the route's name:

----
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="foo.header.test"
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="www.allow.it"
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="www.openshift.test"
----

However, `myrouter` will deny the following:

----
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="open.header.test"
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="www.open.header.test"
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="block.it"
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="franco.baresi.block.it"
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="openshift.org"
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="api.openshift.org"
----

Alternatively, to block any routes where the host name is _not_ set to `[{asterisk}.]stickshift.org` or `[{asterisk}.]kates.net`:

----
$ oc adm router myrouter ...
$ oc set env dc/myrouter ROUTER_ALLOWED_DOMAINS="stickshift.org, kates.net"
----

This means that the `myrouter` router will admit:

----
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="stickshift.org"
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="www.stickshift.org"
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="kates.net"
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="api.kates.net"
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="erno.r.kube.kates.net"
----

However, `myrouter` will deny the following:

----
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="www.open.header.test"
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="drive.ottomatic.org"
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="www.wayless.com"
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="www.deny.it"
----

To implement both scenarios, run:

----
$ oc adm router adrouter ...
$ oc env dc/adrouter ROUTER_ALLOWED_DOMAINS="openshift.org, kates.net" \
    ROUTER_DENIED_DOMAINS="ops.openshift.org, metrics.kates.net"
----

This will allow any routes where the host name is set to `[{asterisk}.]openshift.org` or
`[{asterisk}.]kates.net`, and not allow any routes where the host name is set to
`[{asterisk}.]ops.openshift.org` or `[{asterisk}.]metrics.kates.net`.

Therefore, the following will be denied:

----
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="www.open.header.test"
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="ops.openshift.org"
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="log.ops.openshift.org"
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="www.block.it"
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="metrics.kates.net"
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="int.metrics.kates.net"
----

However, the following will be allowed:

----
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="openshift.org"
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="api.openshift.org"
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="m.api.openshift.org"
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="kates.net"
$ oc expose service/<name> --hostname="api.kates.net"
----


[[disable-namespace-ownership-check]]
== Disabling the Namespace Ownership Check

Hosts and subdomains are owned by the namespace of the route that first
makes the claim. Other routes created in the namespace can make claims on
the subdomain. All other namespaces are prevented from making claims on
the claimed hosts and subdomains. The namespace that owns the host also
owns all paths associated with the host, for example `*_www.abc.xyz/path1_*`.

For example, if the host `*_www.abc.xyz_*` is not claimed by any route.
Creating route `r1` with host `*_www.abc.xyz_*` in namespace `ns1` makes
namespace `ns1` the owner of host `*_www.abc.xyz_*` and subdomain `abc.xyz`
for wildcard routes. If another namespace, `ns2`, tries to create a route
with say a different path `*_www.abc.xyz/path1/path2_*`, it would fail
because a route in another namespace (`ns1` in this case) owns that host.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
With
xref:../../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#using-wildcard-routes[wildcard routes]
the namespace that owns the subdomain owns all hosts in the subdomain.
If a namespace owns subdomain `*abc.xyz*` as in the above example,
another namespace cannot claim `z.abc.xyz`.
endif::[]

By disabling the namespace ownership rules, you can disable these restrictions
and allow hosts (and subdomains) to be claimed across namespaces.

[WARNING]
====
If you decide to disable the namespace ownership checks in your router,
be aware that this allows end users to claim ownership of hosts
across namespaces. While this change can be desirable in certain
development environments, use this feature with caution in production
environments, and ensure that your cluster policy has locked down untrusted end
users from creating routes.
====

For example, with `ROUTER_DISABLE_NAMESPACE_OWNERSHIP_CHECK=true`, if
namespace `ns1` creates the oldest route `r1`  `*_www.abc.xyz_*`,  it owns only
the hostname (+ path).  Another namespace can create a wildcard route
even though it does not have the oldest route in that subdomain (`abc.xyz`)
and we could potentially have other namespaces claiming other
non-wildcard overlapping hosts (for example, `foo.abc.xyz`, `bar.abc.xyz`,
`baz.abc.xyz`) and their claims would be granted.

Any other namespace (for example, `ns2`) can now create
a route `r2`  `*_www.abc.xyz/p1/p2_*`,  and it would be admitted.  Similarly
another namespace (`ns3`) can also create a route  `wildthing.abc.xyz`
with a subdomain wildcard policy and it can own the wildcard.

As this example demonstrates, the policy `ROUTER_DISABLE_NAMESPACE_OWNERSHIP_CHECK=true` is more
lax and allows claims across namespaces.  The only time the router would
reject a route with the namespace ownership disabled is if the host+path
is already claimed.

For example, if a new route `rx` tries to claim `*_www.abc.xyz/p1/p2_*`, it
would be rejected as route `r2` owns that host+path combination.  This is true whether route `rx`
is in the same namespace or other namespace since the exact host+path is already claimed.

This feature can be set during router creation or by setting an environment
variable in the router's deployment configuration.
