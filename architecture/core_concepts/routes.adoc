== Overview

An OpenShift route is a way to announce your service to the world. A route,
consumed by a router in conjunction with service endpoints, provides named
connectivity from external sources to your applications. Each route provides a
name, service selector, and, optionally, security configuration.

.Route Object Definition
====

[source,json]
----
{
  "kind": "Route",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "route-unsecure"
  },
  "spec": {
    "host": "www.example.com",
    "to": {
      "kind": "Service",
      "name": "hello-nginx"
    }
  }
}
----

====

OpenShift routers provide external DNS mapping and load balancing to
link:pods_and_services.html#services[services] over protocols that pass
distinguishing information directly to the router. Routers support the following
protocols:

- HTTP
- HTTPS
- WebSockets
- TLS with SNI

NOTE: WebSocket traffic uses the same route conventions and supports the same
TLS termination types as other traffic.

The router uses the service selector to watch the endpoints that support the
service, bypassing its logic and replacing it with the router's own. Routers
subscribe to a configuration and automatically update themselves with any
changes. Router may be containerized or virtual, converting any changes to API
calls to another system, such as *F5*.

Other capabilities exist to load-balance a service within a cluster. These
services are exposed via a configurable link relation between different
services, and ensure a set of services can be available.
link:../../dev_guide/deployments.html[Deployments] can use these services as
local proxies for each host, or reuse the shared routing infrastructure.

As an OpenShift administrator, you can configure routers in your instance. This
allows developers to then set the route types for their projects.

== Route Types
Routes can be either secure or unsecure. Secure routes provide the ability to
use different types of TLS termination to serve certificates to the client.
Routers support link:#edge-termination[edge],
link:#passthrough-termination[passthrough], and
link:#re-encryption-termination[re-encryption] termination.

To create a secure route, specify the TLS termination of the route in a JSON
file.

.An Unsecure Route with a Path:
====

{
  "kind": "Route",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "hello-route"
  },
  "spec": {
    "host": "hello-openshift.v3.rhcloud.com",
    "path": "/test",
    "to": {
      "kind": "Service",
      "name": "hello-openshift"
    }
  }
}
----

====

Unsecure routes are likely faster to set up, as they are the default configuration, but secure routes offer greater security for information to remain private.

== Path Based Routes
Path based routes specify a path component that can be compared against a URL. This implies that the traffic for the route is HTTP based. Routers should match routes based on the most specific path to the least. However, this depends on your implementation. The following table shows example routes and their accessibility:

////
*  For a route with \_www.example.com/test_:
** \_www.example.com/test_ should be accessible
** \_www.example.com_ should not be accessible
*  For routes with \_www.example.com/test_ and \_www.example.com_:
** \_www.example.com/test_ should be accessible
** \_www.example.com_ should be accessible
*  For routes with \_www.example.com_:
** \_www.example.com/test_ should be accessible (matched by the host, not the route)
** \_www.example.com_ should be accessible
////

.Route Availability

== Securing Routes
You can create a secure route to your pods by specifying the TLS termination of
the route and, optionally, providing certificates.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, TLS termination in OpenShift relies on SNI for serving
custom certificates. Any non-SNI traffic received on port 443 has TLS
termination with a generic certificate. In the future, the ability to create
custom front ends within the router will allow all traffic to serve custom
certificates.
====

By default, OpenShift routes are unsecure, but can be set to any of the
following three types of secure TLS termination.

[[edge-termination]]
*Edge Termination*

With edge termination, TLS termination occurs prior to traffic reaching its
destination. TLS certificates are served by the front end of the router.

You can configure edge termination on your route by specifying the following:

.Configuring Edge Termination
====

----
{
  "kind": "Route",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "hello-route"
  },
  "spec": {
    "host": "hello-openshift.v3.rhcloud.com",
    "to": {
      "kind": "Service",
      "name": "hello-openshift"
    },
    "tls": {
        "termination": "edge", <1>
        "certificate": "REDACTED", <2>
        "key": "REDACTED", <3>
        "caCertificate": "REDACTED" <4>
     }
  }
}
----

<1> Set the `*termination*` field to `edge`.
<2> Set the `*certificate*` field to the contents of the certificate file. See
the link:#special-notes[special notes] below.
<3> Set the `*key*` field to the contents of the key file. See the
link:#special-notes[special notes] below.
<4> Set the `*caCertificate*` field to the contents of the CA certificate file.
See the link:#special-notes[special notes] below.
====

[[passthrough-termination]]
*Passthrough Termination*

With passthrough termination, encrypted traffic is sent straight to the
destination without the router providing TLS termination.

You can configure passthrough termination on your route by specifying the
following:

.Configuring Passthrough Termination
====

----
{
  "kind": "Route",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "hello-route"
  },
  "spec": {
    "host": "hello-openshift.v3.rhcloud.com",
    "to": {
      "kind": "Service",
      "name": "hello-openshift"
    },
    "tls": { "termination" : "passthrough" } <1>
  }
}
----

<1> Set the `*termination*` field to `passthrough`.
====

The destination, such as an *Nginx*, *Apache*, or another *HAProxy* instance, is
then responsible for serving certificates for the traffic.

[[re-encryption-termination]]
*Re-encryption Termination*

Re-encryption is a type of edge termination where the client encrypts
communication with a certificate, which is then re-encrypted with a different
certificate when the traffic reaches the destination. The router uses health
checks to determine the authenticity of the host.

You can configure re-encryption termination on your route by specifying the
following:

.Configuring Re-encryption Termination
====

----
{
  "kind": "Route",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "hello-route"
  },
  "spec": {
    "host": "hello-openshift.v3.rhcloud.com",
    "to": {
      "kind": "Service",
      "name": "hello-openshift"
    },
    "tls": {
        "termination": "reencrypt", <1>
        "certificate": "REDACTED", <2>
        "key": "REDACTED", <3>
        "caCertificate": "REDACTED", <4>
        "destinationCaCertificate": "REDACTED" <5>
     }
  }
}
----

<1> Set the `*termination*` field to `reencrypt`.
<2> Set the `*certificate*` field to the contents of the certificate file. See
the link:#special-notes[special notes] below.
<3> Set the `*key*` field to the contents of the key file. See the
link:#special-notes[special notes] below.
<4> Set the `*caCertificate*` field to the contents of the CA certificate file.
See the link:#special-notes[special notes] below.
<5> Use the `*destinationCaCertificate*` field to validate the secure connection
from the router to the destination, specific to each implementation. See the
link:#special-notes[special notes] below.
====

[[wildcard-certificates]]
*Wildcard Certificates*

Based on the implementation, you may be able to use a default certificate.
Default certificates are useful for implementing a wildcard certificate for the
router. For example, if you have many routes that end in _example.com_, you may
want to install a router with a wildcard certificate for _*.example.com_.

To provide the default certificate to the router, you must specify it in the
create command with the `--default-cert` option. The certificate should be a
concatenated file of the key, certificate, and any CA certificates that are
required by the browser. The certificate should be in a form acceptable by the
underlying router implementation. In the case of HAProxy, it should be a PEM
based certificate:

----
$ oadm router --credentials="$KUBECONFIG" --default-cert=/full/path/to/certificate.pem
----

For HAProxy, if a default certificate is provided, it loads the default certificate first. The
certificate that is loaded first is presented to any route that matches the
CN on the certificate and any route that is secure but does not match any
configured certificates.

For example, if the default certificate is for _\*.example.com_ and a secure
route for _www.foo.com_ is created with no certificates, the route is still be
written and the router serves the _*.example.com_ certficiate. This may result
in a browser warning for users because the CN on the certificate does not match
the URL.

If no default certificate is supplied, the HAProxy router defaults to a generic,
expired certificate that is provided in the base image.

[[special-notes]]
*Special Notes About Secure Routes*

Currently, password protected key files are not supported. HAProxy prompts you
for a password upon starting and does not have a way to automate this process.
To remove a passphrase from a keyfile, you can run:

----
$ openssl rsa -in <passwordProtectedKey.key> -out <new.key>
----

When creating a secure route, you must include your certificate files as a
single line of text. Replace the existing line breaks with:

----
\n
----

== Routers
A template router provides certain infrastructure information to the underlying
router implementation, such as:

- A wrapper that watches endpoints and routes.
- Endpoint and route data, which is saved into a consumable form.
- Passing the internal state to a configurable template and executing the
template.
- Calling a reload script.

Router plug-ins assume they can bind to host ports 80 and 443. This is to allow
external traffic to route to the host and subsequently through the router.
Routers also assume that networking is configured such that it can access all
pods in the cluster.

Currently, a template router is the single type of router plug-in
available in OpenShift.

[[haproxy-template-router]]
=== HAProxy Template Router
The HAProxy template router implementation is the reference implementation for a
template router plug-in. It uses the *openshift/origin-haproxy-router*
repository to run an HAProxy instance alongside the template router plug-in.

[NOTE]
====
The Administration Guide provides instructions on
link:../../admin_guide/install/deploy_router.html[installing the default HAProxy
router].
====

The following diagram illustrates how data flows from the master through the
plug-in and finally into an HAProxy configuration:

.HAProxy Router Data Flow
image::router_model.png[HAProxy Router Data Flow]

*Sticky Sessions*

Implementing sticky sessions is up to the underlying router configuration. The
default HAProxy template implements sticky sessions using the `balance source`
directive which balances based on the source IP. In addition, the template
router plug-in provides the service name and namespace to the underlying
implementation. This can be used for more advanced configuration such as
implementing stick-tables that synchronize between a set of peers.

See the *_haproxy-config.template_* file located in the
*_/var/lib/haproxy/conf_* directory of your router container for details on the
implementation.

== High Availability
You can link:../../admin_guide/high_availability.html[set up a highly-available
router or network service] on your OpenShift cluster using IP failover.
