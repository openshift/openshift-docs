== Overview

An OpenShift route is a way to expose a
link:pods_and_services.html#services[service] by giving it an
externally-reachable hostname like `www.example.com`.

A defined route and the endpoints identified by its service can be consumed by
a router to provide named connectivity that allows external clients to reach
your applications. Each route consists of a route name, service selector,
and (optionally) security configuration.

== Routers

An OpenShift administrator can
link:../../admin_guide/install/deploy_router.html[deploy
routers] in an OpenShift cluster. These enable routes
link:../../dev_guide/routes.html#creating-routes[created by developers]
to be used by external clients.

OpenShift routers provide external hostname mapping and load balancing
to link:pods_and_services.html#services[services] over protocols that
pass distinguishing information directly to the router; the hostname
must be present in the protocol in order for the router to determine
where to send it. Routers support the following protocols:

- HTTP
- HTTPS (with SNI)
- WebSockets
- TLS with SNI

NOTE: WebSocket traffic uses the same route conventions and supports the same
TLS termination types as other traffic.

A router uses the service selector to find the service and the endpoints
backing the service. Service-provided load balancing is bypassed and
replaced with the router's own load balancing. Routers watch the cluster
API and automatically update their own configuration according to any
relevant changes in the API objects. Routers may be containerized or
virtual. Custom routers can be deployed to communicate modifications of
API objects to another system, such as an *F5*.

In order to reach a router in the first place, requests for hostnames
must resolve via DNS to a router or set of routers. The suggested
method is to define a cloud domain with a wildcard DNS entry pointing
to a virtual IP backed by multiple router instances on designated nodes.
link:../../admin_guide/high_availability.html#configuring-a-highly-available-routing-service[Router
vIP configuration is described in the Administration Guide]. DNS
for addresses outside the cloud domain would need to be configured
individually. Other approaches may be feasible.

=== Template Routers
Currently, a template router is the single type of router plug-in
available in OpenShift.

A template router provides certain infrastructure information to the underlying
router implementation, such as:

- A wrapper that watches endpoints and routes.
- Endpoint and route data, which is saved into a consumable form.
- Passing the internal state to a configurable template and executing the
template.
- Calling a reload script.

Router plug-ins assume they can bind to host ports 80 and 443. This is to allow
external traffic to route to the host and subsequently through the router.
Routers also assume that networking is configured such that it can access all
pods in the cluster.

[[haproxy-template-router]]
=== HAProxy Template Router
The HAProxy template router implementation is the reference implementation for a
template router plug-in. It uses the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*openshift3/ose-haproxy-router*
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*openshift/origin-haproxy-router*
endif::[]
repository to run an HAProxy instance alongside the template router plug-in.

The following diagram illustrates how data flows from the master through the
plug-in and finally into an HAProxy configuration:

*Sticky Sessions*

Implementing sticky sessions is up to the underlying router configuration. The
default HAProxy template implements sticky sessions using the `balance source`
directive which balances based on the source IP. In addition, the template
router plug-in provides the service name and namespace to the underlying
implementation. This can be used for more advanced configuration such as
implementing stick-tables that synchronize between a set of peers.

Specific configuration for this router implementation is stored in the
*_haproxy-config.template_* file located in the *_/var/lib/haproxy/conf_*
directory of the router container.

[[route-hostnames]]

== Route Host Names
In order for services to be exposed externally, an OpenShift route allows you to
associate a service with an externally-reachable host name. This edge host name
is then used to route traffic to the service.

.A Route with a Specified Host:
====

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: host-route
spec:
  host: www.example.com  <1>
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: service-name
----
<1> Specifies the externally-reachable host name used to expose a service.
====

.A Route Without a Host:
====

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: no-route-hostname
spec:
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: service-name
----
====

If a host name is not provided as part of the route definition, then
OpenShift automatically generates one for you. The generated host name
is of the form:

----
*$routename[.$namespace].$suffix*
----

The following example shows the OpenShift-generated host name for the above
configuration of a route without a host added to a namespace *my-namespace*:

.Generated Host Name
====

----
no-route-hostname.my-namespace.router.openshift.local <1>
----
<1> The generated host name suffix is the default routing subdomain
*router.openshift.local*.
====

=== Custom Default Routing Subdomain
A cluster administrator can customize the suffix or the default routing
subdomain for an environment using the
link:../../admin_guide/master_node_configuration.html#master-configuration-files[master
configuration file] (the *_/etc/openshift/master/master-config.yaml_* file by
default). The following example shows how you can set the configured suffix to
*v3.openshift.test*:

.Master Configuration Snippet
====

----
routingConfig:
  subdomain: v3.openshift.test
----
====

With the OpenShift master(s) running the above configuration, the
generated host name for the example of a host added to a namespace
*my-namespace* would be:

.Generated Host Name
====

----
no-route-hostname.my-namespace.v3.openshift.test
----
====

== Route Types
Routes can be either secured or unsecured. Secure routes provide the ability to
use several types of TLS termination to serve certificates to the client.
Routers support link:#edge-termination[edge],
link:#passthrough-termination[passthrough], and
link:#re-encryption-termination[re-encryption] termination.

.Unsecured Route Object YAML Definition
====

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: route-unsecured
spec:
  host: www.example.com
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: service-name
----

====

Unsecured routes are simplest to configure, as they require no key
or certificates, but secured routes offer security for connections to
remain private.

A secured route is one that specifies the TLS termination of the route.
The available types of termination are link:#secured-routes[described
below].

== Path Based Routes
Path based routes specify a path component that can be compared against
a URL (which requires that the traffic for the route be HTTP based) such
that multiple routes can be served using the same hostname, each with a
different path. Routers should match routes based on the most specific
path to the least; however, this depends on the router implementation. The
following table shows example routes and their accessibility:

.Route Availability
[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
|Route |When Compared to |Accessible

.2+|_www.example.com/test_ |_www.example.com/test_ |Yes

|_www.example.com_ |No

.2+|_www.example.com/test_ and _www.example.com_ |_www.example.com/test_ |Yes

|_www.example.com_ |Yes

.2+|_www.example.com_ |_www.example.com/test_ |Yes (Matched by the host, not the route)

|_www.example.com_ |Yes
|===

.An Unsecured Route with a Path:
====

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: route-unsecured
spec:
  host: www.example.com
  path: "/test"   <1>
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: service-name
----

<1> The path is the only added attribute for a path-based route.
====

[NOTE]
====
Path-based routing is not available when using passthrough TLS, as
the router does not terminate TLS in that case and cannot read the contents
of the request.
====

== Secured Routes
Secured routes specify the TLS termination of the route and, optionally,
provide a key and certificate(s).

[NOTE]
====
TLS termination in OpenShift relies on
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication[SNI] for serving
custom certificates. Any non-SNI traffic received on port 443 is handled with TLS
termination and a default certificate (which may not match the requested hostname,
resulting in validation errors).
====

Secured routes can use any of the following three types of secure TLS
termination.

[[edge-termination]]
*Edge Termination*

With edge termination, TLS termination occurs at the
router, prior to proxying traffic to its destination. TLS
certificates are served by the front end of the router,
so they must be configured into the route, otherwise the
link:../../admin_guide/install/deploy_router.html#using-wildcard-dns[router's
default certificate] will be used for TLS termination.

.A Secured Route Using Edge Termination
====

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: route-edge-secured
spec:
  host: www.example.com
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: service-name
  tls:
    termination: edge            <1>
    key: |-                      <2>
      -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
      [...]
      -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
    certificate: |-              <3>
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      [...]
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    caCertificate: |-            <4>
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      [...]
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----
<1> The `*termination*` field is `edge` for edge termination.
<2> The `*certificate*` field is the contents of the PEM format certificate file.
<3> The `*key*` field is the contents of the PEM format key file.
<4> An optional CA certificate may be required to establish a certificate chain for validation.
====

Because TLS is terminated at the router, connections from the router to
the endpoints over the internal network are not encrypted.

[[passthrough-termination]]
*Passthrough Termination*

With passthrough termination, encrypted traffic is sent straight to the
destination without the router providing TLS termination. Therefore no
key or certificate is required.

.A Secured Route Using Passthrough Termination
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: route-passthrough-secured
spec:
  host: www.example.com
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: service-name
  tls:
    termination: passthrough     <1>
----
<1> The `*termination*` field is set to `passthrough`. No other encryption fields are needed.
====

The destination pod is responsible for serving certificates for the
traffic at the endpoint. This is currently the only method that can support
requiring client certificates (also known as two-way authentication).

[[re-encryption-termination]]
*Re-encryption Termination*

Re-encryption is a variation on edge termination where the router terminates
TLS with a certificate, then re-encrypts its connection to the endpoint which
may have a different certificate. Therefore the full path of the connection
is encrypted, even over the internal network. The router uses health
checks to determine the authenticity of the host.


.A Secured Route Using Re-Encrypt Termination
====

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: route-pt-secured
spec:
  host: www.example.com
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: service-name
  tls:
    termination: reencrypt        <1>
    key: [as in edge termination]
    certificate: [as in edge termination]
    caCertificate: [as in edge termination]
    destinationCaCertificate: |-  <2>
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      [...]
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----

<1> The `*termination*` field is set to `reencrypt`. Other fields are as in edge termination.
<2> The `*destinationCaCertificate*` field optionally specifies a CA
certificate to validate the endpoint certificate, securing the connection
from the router to the destination.
