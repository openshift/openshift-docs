== Replication Controllers

A replication controller ensures that a specified number of replicas of a pod
are running at all times. If pods exit or are deleted, the replica controller
acts to instantiate more up to the desired number. Likewise, if there are more
running than desired, it deletes as many as necessary to match the number.

The definition of a replication controller consists mainly of:

1. The number of replicas desired (which can be adjusted at runtime).
2. A pod definition for creating a replicated pod.
3. A selector for identifying managed pods.

The selector is just a set of labels that all of the pods managed by the
replication controller should have. So that set of labels is included
in the pod definition that the replication controller instantiates.
This selector is used by the replication controller to determine how many
instances of the pod are already running in order to adjust as needed.

It is not the job of the replication controller to perform auto-scaling
based on load or traffic, as it does not track either; rather, this
would require its replica count to be adjusted by an external auto-scaler.

Replication controllers are a core Kubernetes object, `*ReplicationController*`.
The
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/replication-controller.md[Kubernetes documentation]
has more details on replication controllers.

Here is an example `*ReplicationController*` definition with some omissions and callouts:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: frontend-1
spec:
  replicas: 1  <1>
  selector:    <2>
    name: frontend
  template:    <3>
    metadata:
      labels:  <4>
        name: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: openshift/hello-openshift
        name: helloworld
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP
      restartPolicy: Always
----

1. The number of copies of the pod to run.
2. The label selector of the pod to run.
3. A template for the pod the controller creates.
4. Labels on the pod should include those from the label selector.

== Deployments and Deployment Configurations

Building on replication controllers, OpenShift adds expanded support
for the software development and deployment lifecycle with the concept
of deployments.  In the simplest case, a deployment just creates a new
replication controller and lets it start up pods.  However, OpenShift
deployments also provide the ability to transition from an existing
deployment of an image to a new one and also define hooks to be run
before or after creating the replication controller.

The OpenShift DeploymentConfiguration object defines the following details of a deployment:

1. The elements of a `*ReplicationController*` definition.
2. Triggers for creating a new deployment automatically.
3. The strategy for transitioning between deployments.
4. Life cycle hooks.

Each time a deployment is triggered, whether manually or automatically,
a deployer pod manages the deployment (including scaling down the old
replication controller, scaling up the new one, and running hooks).
The deployment pod remains for an indefinite amount of time after it
completes the deployment in order to retain its logs of the deployment.
When a deployment is superseded by another, the previous replication
controller is retained to enable easy rollback if needed.

For detailed instructions on how to create and interact with deployments,
refer to link:../../dev_guide/deployments.html[Deployments].

Here is an example `*DeploymentConfiguration*` definition with some
omissions and callouts:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: DeploymentConfig
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 5
  selector:
    name: frontend
  template: { ... }
  triggers:
  - type: ConfigChange <1>
  - imageChangeParams:
      automatic: true
      containerNames:
      - helloworld
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: hello-openshift:latest
    type: ImageChange  <2>
  strategy:
    type: Rolling      <3>
----

1. A `*ConfigChange*` trigger causes a new deployment to be created any time the replication controller template changes.
2. An `*ImageChange*` trigger causes a new deployment to be created each time a new version of the backing image is available in the named image stream.
3. The default `*Rolling*` strategy makes a downtime-free transition between deployments.
