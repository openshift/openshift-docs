[[replication-controllers]]
== Replication controllers

A
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicationcontroller/[replication
controller] ensures that a specified number of replicas of a pod are running at
all times. If pods exit or are deleted, the replication controller acts to
instantiate more up to the defined number. Likewise, if there are more running
than desired, it deletes as many as necessary to match the defined amount.

A replication controller configuration consists of:

1. The number of replicas desired (which can be adjusted at runtime).
2. A pod definition to use when creating a replicated pod.
3. A selector for identifying managed pods.

A selector is a set of labels assigned to
the pods that are managed by the replication controller. These labels are
included in the pod definition that the replication controller instantiates.
The replication controller uses the selector to determine how many
instances of the pod are already running in order to adjust as needed.

The replication controller does not perform auto-scaling based on load or
traffic, as it does not track either. Rather, this would require its replica
count to be adjusted by an external auto-scaler.

A replication controller is a core Kubernetes object called `*ReplicationController*`.

The following is an example `*ReplicationController*` definition:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: frontend-1
spec:
  replicas: 1  <1>
  selector:    <2>
    name: frontend
  template:    <3>
    metadata:
      labels:  <4>
        name: frontend <5>
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: openshift/hello-openshift
        name: helloworld
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP
      restartPolicy: Always
----
<1> The number of copies of the pod to run.
<2> The label selector of the pod to run.
<3> A template for the pod the controller creates.
<4> Labels on the pod should include those from the label selector.
<5> The maximum name length after expanding any parameters is 63 characters.


[[jobs]]
== Jobs

A job is similar to a replication controller, in that its purpose is to create
pods for specified reasons. The difference is that replication controllers are
designed for pods that will be continuously running, whereas jobs are for
one-time pods. A job tracks any successful completions and when the specified
amount of completions have been reached, the job itself is completed.

The following example computes Ï€ to 2000 places, prints it out, then completes:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: extensions/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: pi
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: pi
  template:
    metadata:
      name: pi
      labels:
        app: pi
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pi
        image: perl
        command: ["perl",  "-Mbignum=bpi", "-wle", "print bpi(2000)"]
      restartPolicy: Never

to use jobs.

[[deployments-and-deployment-configurations]]
== Deployments and Deployment Configurations

Building on replication controllers, {product-title} adds expanded support
for the software development and deployment lifecycle with the concept
of deployments.  In the simplest case, a deployment just creates a new
replication controller and lets it start up pods.  However, {product-title}
deployments also provide the ability to transition from an existing
deployment of an image to a new one and also define hooks to be run
before or after creating the replication controller.

The {product-title} `*DeploymentConfig*` object defines the following
details of a deployment:

1. The elements of a `*ReplicationController*` definition.
2. Triggers for creating a new deployment automatically.
3. The strategy for transitioning between deployments.
4. Life cycle hooks.

Each time a deployment is triggered, whether manually or automatically,
a deployer pod manages the deployment (including scaling down the old
replication controller, scaling up the new one, and running hooks).
The deployment pod remains for an indefinite amount of time after it
completes the deployment in order to retain its logs of the deployment.
When a deployment is superseded by another, the previous replication
controller is retained to enable easy rollback if needed.

For detailed instructions on how to create and interact with deployments,
refer to xref:../../dev_guide/deployments/basic_deployment_operations.adoc#dev-guide-basic-deployment-operations[Deployments].

Here is an example `*DeploymentConfig*` definition with some
omissions and callouts:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: DeploymentConfig
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 5
  selector:
    name: frontend
  template: { ... }
  triggers:
  - type: ConfigChange <1>
  - imageChangeParams:
      automatic: true
      containerNames:
      - helloworld
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: hello-openshift:latest
    type: ImageChange  <2>
  strategy:
    type: Rolling      <3>
----
<1> A `*ConfigChange*` trigger causes a new deployment to be created any time the replication controller template changes.
<2> An `*ImageChange*` trigger causes a new deployment to be created each time a new version of the backing image is available in the named image stream.
<3> The default `*Rolling*` strategy makes a downtime-free transition between deployments.
