== Overview

A xref:router.adoc#[router] is one way to
xref:getting_traffic_into_cluster.adoc#[get traffic into the cluster].
The HAProxy Template Router plug-in is one of the available
xref:router.adoc#available-router-plug-ins[router plugins].

== HAProxy Template Router

The template router has two components,

- a wrapper that watches endpoints and routes and causes a reload based on changes.
- a controller that builds the HAProxy configuration file based on routes and endpoints

and the HAProxy router

- version 1.5.18 2016/05/10
- link:https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.5/configuration.html#[Configuration Manual]

The controller and HAProxy are in a pod that is managed by a deployment configuration.
The process of
xref:../../install_config/router/index.adoc#[setting up the router] is automated by
the `oadm router` command.

The controller watches the routes and endpoints for changes. It also watches the health of
HAProxy. When a change is detected, it builds a new haproxy-config file and restarts restarts 
HAPROXY. The haproxy-config file is constructed based on the router's template file and 
information from {product-title}. 

The HAProxy features that are used by {product-title} are described in this document. The 
HAProxy template file can be
xref:../../install_config/router/customized_haproxy_router.adoc#[customized] as needed
to support features that are not currently supported by {product-title}. The
link:https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.5/configuration.html#[HAProxy manual]
describes all of the features supported by HAProxy.

The following diagram illustrates how data flows from the master through the
plug-in and finally into an HAProxy configuration:

*Sticky Sessions*

Implementing sticky sessions is up to the underlying router configuration. The
default HAProxy template implements sticky sessions using the `balance source`
directive which balances based on the source IP. In addition, the template
router plug-in provides the service name and namespace to the underlying
implementation. This can be used for more advanced configuration such as
implementing stick-tables that synchronize between a set of peers.

Specific configuration for this router implementation is stored in the
*_haproxy-config.template_* file located in the *_/var/lib/haproxy/conf_*
directory of the router container.

[NOTE]
====
The `balance source` directive does not distinguish between external client IP
addresses; because of the NAT configuration, the originating IP address
(HAProxy remote) is the same. Unless the HAProxy router is running with
`*hostNetwork: true*`, all external clients will be routed to a single pod.
