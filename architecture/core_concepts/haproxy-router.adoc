== HAProxy Template Router

The template router has two components:

* a wrapper that watches endpoints and routes and causes a HAProxy reload based on changes.
* a controller that builds the HAProxy configuration file based on routes and endpoints.

[NOTE]
====
The link:https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.5/configuration.html[HAProxy router] uses version 1.5.18.
====

The controller and HAProxy are housed inside a pod, which is managed by a
deployment configuration. The process of
xref:../../install_config/router/index.adoc#[setting up the router] is automated
by the `oc adm router` command.

The controller watches the routes and endpoints for changes, as well as
HAProxy's health. When a change is detected, it builds a new haproxy-config file
and restarts  HAProxy. The haproxy-config file is constructed based on the
router's template file and  information from {product-title}.

The  HAProxy template file can be
xref:../../install_config/router/customized_haproxy_router.adoc#[customized] as
needed to support features that are not currently supported by {product-title}.
The link:https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.5/configuration.html[HAProxy
manual] describes all of the features supported by HAProxy.

The following diagram illustrates how data flows from the master through the
plug-in and finally into an HAProxy configuration:

*Sticky Sessions*

Implementing sticky sessions is up to the underlying router configuration. The
default HAProxy template implements sticky sessions using the `balance source`
directive, which balances based on the source IP. In addition, the template
router plug-in provides the service name and namespace to the underlying
implementation. This can be used for more advanced configuration, such as
implementing stick-tables that synchronize between a set of peers.

Specific configuration for this router implementation is stored in the
*_/var/lib/haproxy/conf/haproxy-config.template_* file of the router container.

[NOTE]
====
The `balance source` directive does not distinguish between external client IP
addresses; because of the NAT configuration, the originating IP address
(HAProxy remote) is the same. Unless the HAProxy router is running with
`*hostNetwork: true*`, all external clients are routed to a single pod.
