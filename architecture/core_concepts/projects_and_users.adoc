[[users]]
== Users

Interaction with {product-title} is associated with a user. An {product-title}
user object represents an actor which may be granted permissions in the system
by
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
xref:../../admin_guide/manage_rbac.adoc#managing-role-bindings[adding
roles to them or to their groups].
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
adding roles to them or to their groups.
endif::[]

Several types of users can exist:

[cols="1,4"]
|===

|*Regular users*
|This is the way most interactive {product-title} users will be
represented. Regular users are created automatically in the system upon
first login, or can be created via the API. Regular users are represented
with the `*User*` object. Examples: `joe` `alice`

|*System users*
|Many of these are created automatically when the infrastructure
 is defined, mainly for the purpose of enabling the infrastructure to
 interact with the API securely. They include a cluster administrator
 (with access to everything), a per-node user, users for use by routers
 and registries, and various others. Finally, there is an `*anonymous*`
 system user that is used by default for unauthenticated requests. Examples:
`system:admin` `system:openshift-registry` `system:node:node1.example.com`

|*Service accounts*
|These are special system users associated with projects; some are created automatically when
the project is first created, while project administrators can create more
for the purpose of defining access to the contents of each xref:projects[project].
Service accounts are represented with the `*ServiceAccount*` object. Examples:
`system:serviceaccount:default:deployer` `system:serviceaccount:foo:builder`

|===

Every user must xref:../additional_concepts/authentication.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authentication[authenticate] in
some way in order to access {product-title}. API requests with no authentication
or invalid authentication are authenticated as requests by the `*anonymous*`
system user. Once authenticated, policy determines what the user is
xref:../additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authorization[authorized] to do.

[[namespaces]]
== Namespaces

A Kubernetes namespace provides a mechanism to scope resources in a cluster.
In {product-title}, a xref:projects[project] is a Kubernetes namespace with
additional annotations.

Namespaces provide a unique scope for:

- Named resources to avoid basic naming collisions.
- Delegated management authority to trusted users.
- The ability to limit community resource consumption.

Most objects in the system are scoped by namespace, but some are
excepted and have no namespace, including nodes and users.

The
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/namespaces/[Kubernetes
documentation] has more information on namespaces.

[[projects]]
== Projects
A project is a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations, and is the central vehicle
by which access to resources for regular users is managed.
A project allows a community of users to organize and manage their content in
isolation from other communities. Users must be given access to projects by administrators,
or if allowed to create projects, automatically have access to their own projects.

Projects can have a separate `*name*`, `*displayName*`, and `*description*`.

- The mandatory `*name*` is a unique identifier for the project and is most visible when using the CLI tools or API. The maximum name length is 63 characters.
- The optional `*displayName*` is how the project is displayed in the web console (defaults to `*name*`).
- The optional `*description*` can be a more detailed description of the project and is also visible in the web console.

Each project scopes its own set of:

[cols="1,4"]
|===

|*Objects*
|Pods, services, replication controllers, etc.

|*Policies*
|Rules for which users can or cannot perform actions on objects.

|*Constraints*
|Quotas for each kind of object that can be limited.

|*Service accounts*
|Service accounts act automatically with designated access to objects in the project.

|===

Cluster administrators can xref:../../dev_guide/projects.adoc#dev-guide-projects[create projects]
and
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
xref:../../admin_guide/manage_rbac.adoc#managing-role-bindings[delegate
administrative rights]
endif::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-online[]
delegate administrative rights
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-online[]
for the project to any member of the user community.
Cluster administrators can also allow developers to create
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
xref:../../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#selfprovisioning-projects[their own projects].
endif::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-online[]
their own projects.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-online[]

Developers and administrators can xref:../../dev_guide/projects.adoc#dev-guide-projects[interact
with projects] using xref:../../cli_reference/index.adoc#cli-reference-index[the CLI] or the
xref:../infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-web-console[web console].

[[architecture-projects-projects-at-install]]
=== Projects provided at installation

{product-title} comes with a number of projects out of the box, and `openshift` is the most essential to users:

*`openshift`*
A user-facing project, mainly for housing objects for day-to-day tasks. These
include any application objects for access by multiple projects, such as
templates and images. These objects should be those that do not require
communication between the pods.

ifdef::openshift-online[]
[[projects-hibenation]]
=== Project Hibernation
In {product-title} Starter, a project exceeding 16 cumulative quota-hours of
usage in a rolling 24-hour period must sleep, or _hibernate_, for the next 18 hours.

In {product-title} Pro, projects do not hibernate.

Quota-hours are calculated as the maximum between percentage of terminating and
non-terminating pod resource quota consumed, multiplied by the running time of
those pods. For example, 2 terminating pods each using half of the available
memory quota for 1 hour will be counted as 1 terminating quota-hour.

When the project is in hibernation, the replica count is set to `0` and all
individual pods are deleted. All PVCs and PVs in the project are left untouched.
After the hibernation period is over, a project is put in an idled state, where
the replica count is `0`, but the force-sleep resource quota is removed. Upon
receiving network traffic, the project's replica counts will be restored to
their pre-hibernation value and pods will be created.

If network traffic does not restore a project's replica counts, then you may
have to manually scale up the deployment.
