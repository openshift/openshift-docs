[[users]]
== Users

Interaction with {product-title} is associated with a user. An {product-title}
user object represents an actor which may be granted permissions in the system
by
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
xref:../../admin_guide/manage_rbac.adoc#managing-role-bindings[adding
roles to them or to their groups].
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
adding roles to them or to their groups.
endif::[]

Several types of users can exist:

[cols="1,4"]
|===

|*Regular users*
|This is the way most interactive {product-title} users will be
represented. Regular users are created automatically in the system upon
first login, or can be created via the API. Regular users are represented
with the `*User*` object. Examples: `joe` `alice`

|*System users*
|Many of these are created automatically when the infrastructure
 is defined, mainly for the purpose of enabling the infrastructure to
 interact with the API securely. They include a cluster administrator
 (with access to everything), a per-node user, users for use by routers
 and registries, and various others. Finally, there is an `*anonymous*`
 system user that is used by default for unauthenticated requests. Examples:
`system:admin` `system:node:node1.example.com`

|*Service accounts*
|These are special system users associated with projects; some are created automatically when
the project is first created, while project administrators can create more
for the purpose of defining access to the contents of each xref:projects[project].
Service accounts are represented with the `*ServiceAccount*` object. Examples:
`system:serviceaccount:default:deployer` `system:serviceaccount:foo:builder`

|===

Every user must xref:../additional_concepts/authentication.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authentication[authenticate] in some way in order to access {product-title}.
API requests with no authentication or invalid authentication are authenticated as requests by the `*anonymous*` system user.
Once authenticated, policy determines what the user is xref:../additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authorization[authorized] to do.

[[namespaces]]
== Namespaces

A Kubernetes namespace provides a mechanism to scope resources in a cluster.
In {product-title}, a xref:projects[project] is a Kubernetes namespace with
additional annotations.

Namespaces provide a unique scope for:

- Named resources to avoid basic naming collisions.
- Delegated management authority to trusted users.
- The ability to limit community resource consumption.

Most objects in the system are scoped by namespace, but some are
excepted and have no namespace, including nodes and users.

The
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/namespaces/[Kubernetes
documentation] has more information on namespaces.

[[projects]]
== Projects
A project is a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations, and is the central vehicle
by which access to resources for regular users is managed.
A project allows a community of users to organize and manage their content in
isolation from other communities. Users must be given access to projects by administrators,
or if allowed to create projects, automatically have access to their own projects.

Projects can have a separate `*name*`, `*displayName*`, and `*description*`.

- The mandatory `*name*` is a unique identifier for the project and is most visible when using the CLI tools or API. The maximum name length is 63 characters.
- The optional `*displayName*` is how the project is displayed in the web console (defaults to `*name*`).
- The optional `*description*` can be a more detailed description of the project and is also visible in the web console.

Each project scopes its own set of:

[cols="1,4"]
|===

|*Objects*
|Pods, services, replication controllers, etc.

|*Policies*
|Rules for which users can or cannot perform actions on objects.

|*Constraints*
|Quotas for each kind of object that can be limited.

|*Service accounts*
|Service accounts act automatically with designated access to objects in the project.

Cluster administrators can xref:../../dev_guide/projects.adoc#dev-guide-projects[create projects]

ifdef::openshift-aro[]
{product-title} is a managed Service. The cluster administrator role is not available to customers. The customer administrator role is delegated to the customer for cluster-management operations.

The administrator can xref:../../dev_guide/projects.adoc#dev-guide-projects[create and manage projects]. They can also
xref:../../admin_guide/manage_rbac.adoc#managing-role-bindings[delegate administrative rights].

Developers can create their own projects.
endif::openshift-aro[]

Developers and administrators can xref:../../dev_guide/projects.adoc#dev-guide-projects[interact
with projects] using xref:../../cli_reference/index.adoc#cli-reference-index[the CLI] or the
xref:../infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-web-console[web console].

[[architecture-projects-projects-at-install]]
=== Projects provided at installation

{product-title} comes with a number of projects out of the box, and projects
starting with `openshift-` are the most essential to users.
These projects host master components that run as pods and other infrastructure
components. The pods created in these namespaces that have a
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/guaranteed-scheduling-critical-addon-pods/#rescheduler-guaranteed-scheduling-of-critical-add-ons[critical pod annotation]
are considered critical, and they have guaranteed admission by kubelet.
Pods created for master components in these namespaces are already marked as
critical.

ifdef::openshift-online[]
[[projects-idling]]
== Project Idling
In {product-title} Starter, a project that is inactive for more than 24 hours
is idled. When a project's network activity falls below a configured threshold,
a project is deemed inactive. When a project is idled, the replica count is set
to `0` and all pods are deleted. All persistent volumes (PVs) and persistent
volume claims (PVCs) in the project are left untouched. Upon receiving network
traffic, the replica count will be scaled back to whatever it was before being
idled.

In the web console, you will see your deployment as *Idled due to inactivity*
and you can manually scale the deployment back up.

If network traffic does not restore a project's replica counts, then you may
have to manually scale up the deployment.

[[account-pruning]]
== Account Pruning
If your {product-title} Starter account is inactive, meaning that you have had
no running pods in your project for 3 days, you will receive a warning email
that your account is to be deprovisioned. If you do not take corrective action
and create pods within 5 days, your account is automatically deprovisioned. Once
your account is deprovisioned, you can register again.
