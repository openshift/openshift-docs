== Users

Interaction with OpenShift is associated with a
user. An OpenShift user object represents an
actor which may be granted permissions in the system by
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
link:../../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.html#managing-role-bindings[adding
roles to them or to their groups].
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
adding roles to them or to their groups.
endif::[]

Several types of users can exist:

[cols="1,4"]
|===

|*Regular users*
|This is the way most interactive OpenShift users will be
represented. Regular users are created automatically in the system upon
first login, or can be created via the API. Regular users are represented
with the `*User*` object. Examples: `joe` `alice`

|*System users*
|Many of these are created automatically when the infrastructure
 is defined, mainly for the purpose of enabling the infrastructure to
 interact with the API securely. They include a cluster administrator
 (with access to everything), a per-node user, users for use by routers
 and registries, and various others. Finally, there is an `*anonymous*`
 system user that is used by default for unauthenticated requests. Examples:
`system:admin` `system:openshift-registry` `system:node:node1.example.com`

|*Service accounts*
|These are special system users associated with projects; some are created automatically when
the project is first created, while project administrators can create more
for the purpose of defining access to the contents of each link:#projects[project].
Service accounts are represented with the `*ServiceAccount*` object. Examples:
`system:serviceaccount:default:deployer` `system:serviceaccount:foo:builder`

|===

Every user must link:../additional_concepts/authentication.html[authenticate] in some way in order to access OpenShift.
API requests with no authentication or invalid authentication are authenticated as requests by the `*anonymous*` system user.
Once authenticated, policy determines what the user is link:../additional_concepts/authorization.html[authorized] to do.

== Namespaces

A Kubernetes namespace provides a mechanism to scope resources in a cluster.
In OpenShift, a link:#projects[project] is a Kubernetes namespace with
additional annotations.

Namespaces provide a unique scope for:

- Named resources to avoid basic naming collisions.
- Delegated management authority to trusted users.
- The ability to limit community resource consumption.

Most objects in the system are scoped by namespace, but some are
excepted and have no namespace, including nodes and users.

The
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/admin/namespaces.md[Kubernetes documentation] has more information on namespaces.

== Projects
A project is a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations, and is the central vehicle
by which access to resources for regular users is managed.
A project allows a community of users to organize and manage their content in
isolation from other communities. Users must be given access to projects by administrators,
or if allowed to create projects, automatically have access to their own projects.

Projects can have a separate `*name*`, `*displayName*`, and `*description*`.

- The mandatory `*name*` is a unique identifier for the project and is most visible when using the CLI tools or API.
- The optional `*displayName*` is how the project is displayed in the web console (defaults to `*name*`).
- The optional `*description*` can be a more detailed description of the project and is also visible in the web console.

Each project scopes its own set of:

[cols="1,4"]
|===

|*Objects*
|Pods, services, replication controllers, etc.

|*Policies*
|Rules for which users can or cannot perform actions on objects.

|*Constraints*
|Quotas for each kind of object that can be limited.

|*Service accounts*
|Service accounts act automatically with designated access to objects in the project.

|===

Cluster administrators can link:../../dev_guide/projects.html[create projects]
and
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
link:../../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.html#managing-role-bindings[delegate
administrative rights]
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
delegate administrative rights
endif::[]
for the project to any member of the user community.
Cluster administrators can also allow developers to create
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
link:../../admin_guide/managing_projects.html#selfprovisioning-projects[their own projects].
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
their own projects.
endif::[]

Developers and administrators can link:../../dev_guide/projects.html[interact
with projects] using link:../../cli_reference/index.html[the CLI] or the
link:../infrastructure_components/web_console.html[web console].
