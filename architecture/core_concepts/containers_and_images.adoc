[[containers]]
== Containers

The basic units of {product-title} applications are called containers.
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/1353593[Linux container technologies]
are lightweight mechanisms for isolating running processes so that they are
limited to interacting with only their designated resources. Many application
instances can be running in containers on a single host without visibility into
each others' processes, files, network, and so on. Typically, each container
provides a single service (often called a "micro-service"), such as a web server
or a database, though containers can be used for arbitrary workloads.

The Linux kernel has been incorporating capabilities for container technologies
for years. More recently the
link:https://www.docker.com/whatisdocker/[Docker project] has developed a
convenient management interface for Linux containers on
a host. {product-title} and Kubernetes add the ability to orchestrate Docker
containers across multi-host installations.

Though you do not directly interact with Docker tools when using
{product-title}, understanding Docker's capabilities and terminology is
important for understanding its role in {product-title} and how your
applications function inside of containers. Docker is available
as part of RHEL 7, as well as CentOS and Fedora, so you can
experiment with it separately from {product-title}. Refer to the article
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/881893[Get Started with Docker
Formatted Container Images on Red Hat Systems] for a guided introduction.

[[docker-images]]

== Docker Images

Docker containers are based on Docker images. A Docker image is a
binary that includes all of the requirements for running a single Docker
container, as well as metadata describing its needs and capabilities. You
can think of it as a packaging technology. Docker containers only
have access to resources defined in the image unless you give the
container additional access when creating it. By deploying the same
image in multiple containers across multiple hosts and load balancing
between them, {product-title} can provide redundancy and horizontal scaling
for a service packaged into an image.

You can use Docker directly to build images, but {product-title} also supplies
builders that assist with creating an image by adding your code or
configuration to existing images.

Since applications develop over time, a single image name can actually
refer to many different versions of the "same" image. Each different
image is referred to uniquely by its hash (a long hexadecimal number
e.g. `fd44297e2ddb050ec4f...`) which is usually shortened to 12
characters (e.g. `fd44297e2ddb`). Rather than version numbers, Docker
allows applying tags (such as `v1`, `v2.1`, `GA`, or the default `latest`)
in addition to the image name to further specify the image desired, so
you may see the same image referred to as `centos` (implying the `latest`
tag), `centos:centos7`, or `fd44297e2ddb`.

[[docker-registries]]

== Docker Registries

A Docker registry is a service for storing and retrieving Docker images. A
registry contains a collection of one or more Docker image repositories. Each
image repository contains one or more tagged images. Docker provides its own
registry, the link:https://registry.hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub], but you may
also use private or third-party registries. Red Hat provides a Docker registry
at `registry.access.redhat.com` for subscribers. {product-title} can also supply
its own internal registry for managing custom Docker images.

The relationship between containers, images, and registries is depicted in the
following diagram:
