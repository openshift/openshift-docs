[[pods]]

== Pods

OpenShift leverages the Kubernetes concept of a `*pod*`, which is one or
more xref:containers_and_images.adoc#containers[containers] deployed
together on one host, and the smallest compute unit that can be defined,
deployed, and managed.

Pods are the rough equivalent of OpenShift v2 gears, with containers
the rough equivalent of v2 cartridge instances. Each pod is allocated
its own internal IP address, therefore owning its entire port space,
and containers within pods can share their local storage and networking.

Pods have a lifecycle; they are defined, then they are assigned to run on
a node, then they run until their container(s) exit or they are removed
for some other reason. Pods, depending on policy and exit code, may be
removed after exiting, or may be retained in order to enable access to
the logs of their containers.

OpenShift treats pods as largely immutable; changes cannot be made to
a pod definition while it is running. OpenShift implements changes by
terminating an existing pod and recreating it with modified configuration,
base image(s), or both. Pods are also treated as expendable, and do not
maintain state when recreated. Therefore pods should usually be managed by
higher-level xref:deployments.adoc#replication-controllers[controllers],
rather than directly by users.

Below is an example definition of a pod that provides a long-running
service, which is actually a part of the OpenShift infrastructure: the
private Docker registry. It demonstrates many features of pods, most of
which are discussed in other topics and thus only briefly mentioned here:

<1> Pods can be "tagged" with one or more xref:labels[labels], which can then
be used to select and manage groups of pods in a single operation. The labels
are stored in key/value format in the `*metadata*` hash. One label in this
example is *docker-registry=default*.
<2> Pods must have a unique name within their
xref:projects_and_users.adoc#namespaces[namespace]. A pod definition may specify
the basis of a name with the `*generateName*` attribute, and random characters
will be added automatically to generate a unique name.
<3> `*containers*` specifies an array of container definitions; in this case (as
with most), just one.
<4> Environment variables can be specified to pass necessary values to each
container.
<5> Each container in the pod is instantiated from its own
xref:containers_and_images.adoc#docker-images[Docker image].
<6> The container can bind to ports which will be made available on the pod's
IP.
<7> OpenShift defines a
xref:../additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#security-context-constraints[security
context] for containers which specifies whether they are allowed to run as
privileged containers, run as a user of their choice, and more. The default
context is very restrictive but administrators can modify this as needed.
<8> The container specifies where external storage volumes should be mounted
within the container. In this case, there is a volume for storing the registry's
data, and one for access to credentials the registry needs for making requests
against the OpenShift API.
<9> Pods making requests against the OpenShift API is a common enough pattern
that there is a `*serviceAccount*` field for specifying which
xref:../../dev_guide/service_accounts.adoc#dev-guide-service-accounts[service account] user the pod should
authenticate as when making the requests. This enables fine-grained access
control for custom infrastructure components.
<10> The pod defines storage volumes that are available to its container(s) to
use. In this case, it provides an ephemeral volume for the registry storage and
a `*secret*` volume containing the service account credentials.

[NOTE]
====
This pod definition does not include attributes that
are filled by OpenShift automatically after the pod is created and
its lifecycle begins. The
xref:../../rest_api/kubernetes_v1.adoc#rest-api-kubernetes-v1[Kubernetes API documentation]
has complete details of the pod REST API object attributes, and the
link:https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/user-guide/pods.md[Kubernetes pod documentation]
has details about the functionality and purpose of pods.

[[services]]

== Services

A Kubernetes `*service*` serves as an internal load balancer. It identifies
a set of replicated xref:pods[pods] in order to proxy the connections it
receives to them. Backing pods can be added to or removed from a service
arbitrarily while the service remains consistently available, enabling
anything that depends on the service to refer to it at a consistent
internal address.

Services are assigned an IP address and port pair that, when accessed,
proxy to an appropriate backing pod. A service uses a label selector to find
all the containers running that provide a certain network service on a certain
port.

Like pods, services are REST objects. The following
example shows the definition of a service for the pod defined above:

.Service Object Definition (YAML)
====

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: docker-registry      <1>
spec:
  selector:                  <2>
    docker-registry: default
  portalIP: 172.30.136.123   <3>
  ports:
  - nodePort: 0
    port: 5000               <4>
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 5000         <5>
----

<1> The service name *docker-registry* is also used to construct an
environment variable with the service IP that is inserted into other
pods in the same namespace. The maximum name length is 63 characters.
<2> The label selector identifies all pods with the
*docker-registry=default* label attached as its backing pods.
<3> Virtual IP of the service, allocated automatically at creation from a pool
of internal IPs.
<4> Port the service listens on.
<5> Port on the backing pods to which the service forwards connections.

https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/user-guide/services.md[Kubernetes documentation] has more information on services.

[[labels]]

== Labels

Labels are used to organize, group, or select API objects.
For example, xref:pods[pods] are "tagged" with labels, and then
xref:services[services] use label selectors to identify the pods they
proxy to. This makes it possible for services to reference groups of
pods, even treating pods with potentially different Docker containers
as related entities.

Most objects can include labels in their metadata. So labels can
be used to group arbitrarily-related objects; for example,
all of the xref:pods[pods], xref:services[services],
xref:deployments.adoc#replication-controllers[replication
controllers], and
xref:deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configurations] of a particular application can be grouped.

Labels are simple key/value pairs, as in the following example:

====

[source,yaml]
----
labels:
  key1: value1
  key2: value2
----

====

Consider:

- A pod consisting of an *nginx* Docker container, with the label
*role=webserver*.
- A pod consisting of an *Apache httpd* Docker container, with the same label
*role=webserver*.

A service or replication controller that is defined to use pods with the
*role=webserver* label treats both of these pods as part of the same group.

The
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/user-guide/labels.md[Kubernetes
documentation] has more information on labels.
