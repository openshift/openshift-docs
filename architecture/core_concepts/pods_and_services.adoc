== Pods

{product-title} leverages the Kubernetes concept of a _pod_, which is one or more xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/containers_and_images.adoc#containers[containers] deployed
together on one host, and the smallest compute unit that can be defined,
deployed, and managed.

Pods are the rough equivalent of a machine instance (physical or virtual) to a container. Each pod is allocated its own internal IP address, therefore owning its entire port space, and containers within pods can share their local storage and networking.

Pods have a lifecycle; they are defined, then they are assigned to run on
a node, then they run until their container(s) exit or they are removed
for some other reason. Pods, depending on policy and exit code, may be
removed after exiting, or may be retained in order to enable access to
the logs of their containers.

{product-title} treats pods as largely immutable; changes cannot be made to
a pod definition while it is running. {product-title} implements changes by
terminating an existing pod and recreating it with modified configuration,
base image(s), or both. Pods are also treated as expendable, and do not
maintain state when recreated. Therefore pods should usually be managed by
higher-level xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#replication-controllers[controllers],
rather than directly by users.

[NOTE]
====
See the
xref:../../scaling_performance/cluster_limits.adoc#scaling-performance-current-cluster-limits[Cluster
Limits] page for the maximum number of pods per node supported limits of 
{product-title}.
====

[WARNING]
====
Bare pods that are not managed by a xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#replication-controllers[replication
controller] will be not rescheduled upon node disruption.
====

Below is an example definition of a pod that provides a long-running
service, which is actually a part of the {product-title} infrastructure: the
integrated container registry. It demonstrates many features of pods, most of
which are discussed in other topics and thus only briefly mentioned here:

<1> Pods can be "tagged" with one or more xref:labels[labels], which can then
be used to select and manage groups of pods in a single operation. The labels
are stored in key/value format in the `*metadata*` hash. One label in this
example is *docker-registry=default*.
<2> Pods must have a unique name within their
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#namespaces[namespace]. A pod definition may specify
the basis of a name with the `*generateName*` attribute, and random characters
will be added automatically to generate a unique name.
<3> `*containers*` specifies an array of container definitions; in this case (as
with most), just one.
<4> Environment variables can be specified to pass necessary values to each
container.
<5> Each container in the pod is instantiated from its own
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/containers_and_images.adoc#docker-images[Docker-formatted container image].
<6> The container can bind to ports which will be made available on the pod's
IP.
<7> {product-title} defines a
ifndef::openshift-online[]
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#security-context-constraints[security
context]
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-online[]
security context
endif::[]
for containers which specifies whether they are allowed to run as
privileged containers, run as a user of their choice, and more. The default
context is very restrictive but administrators can modify this as needed.
<8> The container specifies where external storage volumes should be mounted
within the container. In this case, there is a volume for storing the registry's
data, and one for access to credentials the registry needs for making requests
against the {product-title} API.
<9> The xref:admin-manage-pod-restart[pod restart policy] with possible values `Always`, `OnFailure`, and `Never`. The default value is `Always`.
<10> Pods making requests against the {product-title} API is a common enough pattern
that there is a `*serviceAccount*` field for specifying which
xref:../../dev_guide/service_accounts.adoc#dev-guide-service-accounts[service account] user the pod should
authenticate as when making the requests. This enables fine-grained access
control for custom infrastructure components.
<11> The pod defines storage volumes that are available to its container(s) to
use. In this case, it provides an ephemeral volume for the registry storage and
a `*secret*` volume containing the service account credentials.

[NOTE]
====
This pod definition does not include attributes that
are filled by {product-title} automatically after the pod is created and
its lifecycle begins. The
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/[Kubernetes pod documentation] has details about the functionality and purpose of pods.
====

[[admin-manage-pod-restart]]
=== Pod Restart Policy
//from https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy
A pod restart policy determines how {product-title} responds when containers in that pod exit.
The policy applies to all containers in that pod.

The possible values are:

* `Always` - Tries restarting a successfully exited container on the pod continuously, with an exponential back-off delay (10s, 20s, 40s) until the pod is restarted. The default is `Always`.
* `OnFailure` - Tries restarting a failed container on the pod with an exponential back-off delay (10s, 20s, 40s) capped at 5 minutes.
* `Never` - Does not try to restart exited or failed containers on the pod. Pods immediately fail and exit.

//https://kubernetes-v1-4.github.io/docs/user-guide/pod-states/
Once bound to a node, a pod will never be bound to another node. This means that a controller is necessary in order for a pod to survive node failure:

[cols="3",options="header"]
|===

|Condition
|Controller Type
|Restart Policy

|Pods that are expected to terminate (such as batch computations)
|xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#jobs[Job]
|`OnFailure` or `Never`

|Pods that are expected to not terminate (such as web servers)
|xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#replication-controllers[Replication Controller]
| `Always`.

|Pods that need to run one-per-machine
|Daemonset
|Any
|===

If a container on a pod fails and the restart policy is set to `OnFailure`, the pod stays on the node and the container is restarted. If you do not want the container to
restart, use a restart policy of `Never`.

//https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/#handling-pod-and-container-failures
If an entire pod fails, {product-title} starts a new pod. Developers need to address the possibility that applications might be restarted in a new pod. In particular,
applications need to handle temporary files, locks, incomplete output, and so forth caused by previous runs.

For details on how {product-title} uses restart policy with failed containers, see
the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#example-states[Example States] in the Kubernetes documentation.

[[admin-manage-pod-preset]]
=== Injecting Information into Pods Using Pod Presets

A _pod preset_ is an object that injects user-specified information into pods as they are created.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Pod presets is a Technology Preview feature only.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not
supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs), might not be
functionally complete, and Red Hat does not recommend to use them for
production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features,
enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the
development process.

For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features support scope, see
https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.
endif::[]
====

Using pod preset objects you can inject:

* xref:../../dev_guide/secrets.adoc#dev-guide-secrets[secret objects]
* xref:../../dev_guide/configmaps.adoc#consuming-configmap-in-pods[`ConfigMap` objects]
* xref:../../dev_guide/volumes.adoc#dev-guide-volumes[storage volumes]
* container volume mounts
* environment variables

Developers need to ensure the pod labels match the label selector on the PodPreset in order to add all that information to the pod. The xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[label] on a pod associates the pod with one or more pod preset objects that have a matching xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[label selectors].

Using pod presets, a developer can provision pods without needing to know the details about the services the pod will consume. An administrator can keep configuration items of a service invisible from a developer without preventing the developer from deploying pods.

[NOTE]
====
The Pod Preset feature is available only if the xref:../../architecture/service_catalog/index.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-service-catalog[Service Catalog] has been installed.
====

You can exclude specific pods from being injected using the `podpreset.admission.kubernetes.io/exclude: "true"` parameter in the pod specification.
See the xref:../../dev_guide/pod_preset.adoc#sample-pod-spec-exclude-preset[example pod specification].

For more information, see xref:../../dev_guide/pod_preset.adoc#dev-guide-pod-presets[Injecting Information into Pods Using Pod Presets].

[[pods-services-init-containers]]
== Init Containers

An link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/[init container] is a container in a pod that is started before the pod app containers are started. Init containers can share volumes, perform network operations, and perform computations before the remaining containers start. Init containers can also block or delay the startup of application containers until some precondition is met.

When a pod starts, after the network and volumes are initialized, the init containers are started in order. Each init container must exit successfully before the next is invoked. If an init container fails to start (due to the runtime) or exits with failure, it is retried according to the pod
xref:admin-manage-pod-restart[restart policy].

A pod cannot be ready until all init containers have succeeded.

See the Kubernetes documentation for some link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/#examples[init container usage examples].

The following example outlines a simple pod which has two init containers. The first init container waits for `myservice` and the second waits for `mydb`. Once both containers succeed, the Pod starts.

.Sample Init Container Pod Object Definition (YAML)
====

[source,yaml]

    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo The app is running! && sleep 3600']
  initContainers:
  - name: init-myservice <1>
    image: busybox
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'until nslookup myservice; do echo waiting for myservice; sleep 2; done;']
  - name: init-mydb <2>
    image: busybox
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'until nslookup mydb; do echo waiting for mydb; sleep 2; done;']
----

====

<1> Specifies the `myservice` container.
<2> Specifies the `mydb` container.

Each init container has all of the xref:example-pod-definition[fields of an app container] except for xref:../../dev_guide/application_health.adoc#container-health-checks-using-probes[`readinessProbe`]. Init containers must exit for pod startup to continue and cannot define readiness other than completion.

Init containers can include xref:../../dev_guide/jobs.adoc#jobs-setting-maximum-duration[`activeDeadlineSeconds`] on the pod and xref:../../dev_guide/application_health.adoc#container-health-checks-using-probes[`livenessProbe`] on the container to prevent init containers from failing forever. The active deadline includes init containers.

[[services]]

== Services

A Kubernetes link:http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services[service] serves
as an internal load balancer. It identifies a set of replicated xref:pods[pods]
in order to proxy the connections it receives to them. Backing pods can be added
to or removed from a service arbitrarily while the service remains consistently
available, enabling anything that depends on the service to refer to it at a
consistent address.  The default service clusterIP addresses are from the
{product-title} internal network and they are used to permit pods to access each
other.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
To permit external access to the service, additional `externalIP` and
`ingressIP` addresses that are
xref:../../dev_guide/expose_service/expose_internal_ip_service.adoc#getting-traffic-into-cluster-ip[external]
to the cluster can be assigned to the service. These `externalIP` addresses can
also be virtual IP addresses that provide
xref:../../admin_guide/high_availability.adoc#admin-guide-high-availability[highly available] access to the service.
endif::[]

Services are assigned an IP address and port pair that, when accessed,
proxy to an appropriate backing pod. A service uses a label selector to find
all the containers running that provide a certain network service on a certain
port.

Like pods, services are REST objects. The following
example shows the definition of a service for the pod defined above:

[[service-externalip]]
=== Service externalIPs

In addition to the cluster's internal IP addresses, the user can configure IP addresses that are external to the cluster. The administrator is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrives at a node with this IP.

The externalIPs must be selected by the cluster adminitrators from the
*ExternalIPNetworkCIDRs* range configured in
xref:../../admin_guide/tcp_ingress_external_ports.adoc#unique-external-ips-ingress-traffic-configure-cluster[*_master-config.yaml_*]

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
[[service-ingressip]]
=== Service ingressIPs

In non-cloud clusters, externalIP addresses can be automatically assigned from a
pool of addresses. This eliminates the need for the administrator manually
assigning them.

The pool is configured in *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file. After
changing this file, restart the master service.

The `ingressIPNetworkCIDR` is set to `172.29.0.0/16` by default. If the cluster
environment is not already using this private range, use the default range or
set a custom range.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using xref:../../admin_guide/high_availability.adoc#admin-guide-high-availability[high availability], then this range must be less than 256
addresses.

[[service-nodeport]]
=== Service NodePort

Setting the service `type=NodePort` will allocate a port from a flag-configured range (default: 30000-32767), and each node will proxy that port (the same port number on every node) into your service.

The selected port will be reported in the service configuration, under  `spec.ports[*].nodePort`.

To specify a custom port just place the port number in the nodePort field. The custom port number must be in the configured range for nodePorts. When '*master-config.yaml*' is changed the master services must be restarted.

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
[[service-proxy-mode]]
=== Service Proxy Mode

{product-title} has two different implementations of the service-routing
infrastructure. The default implementation is entirely *iptables*-based, and
uses probabilistic *iptables* rewriting rules to distribute incoming service
connections between the endpoint pods. The older implementation uses a user
space process to accept incoming connections and then proxy traffic between the
client and one of the endpoint pods.

The *iptables*-based implementation is much more efficient, but it requires that
all endpoints are always able to accept connections; the user space
implementation is slower, but can try multiple endpoints in turn until it finds
one that works. If you have good
xref:../../dev_guide/application_health.adoc#dev-guide-application-health[readiness
checks] (or generally reliable nodes and pods), then the *iptables*-based
service proxy is the best choice. Otherwise, you can enable the user space-based
proxy when installing, or after deploying the cluster by editing the node
configuration file.

[[oso-osd-service-proxy]]
=== Service Proxy

{product-title} has an *iptables*-based implementation of the service-routing
infrastructure. It uses probabilistic *iptables* rewriting rules to distribute
incoming service connections between the endpoint pods. It also requires that
all endpoints are always able to accept connections.
endif::[]

[[headless-services]]
=== Headless services
If your application does not need load balancing or single-service IP addresses,
you can create a headless service. When you create a headless service, no
load-balancing or proxying is done and no cluster IP is allocated for this
service. For such services, DNS is automatically configured depending on whether
the service has selectors defined or not.

*Services with selectors*: For headless services that define selectors, the
endpoints controller creates `Endpoints` records in the API and modifies the
DNS configuration to return `A` records (addresses) that point directly to the
pods backing the service.

*Services without selectors*: For headless services that do not define
selectors, the endpoints controller does not create `Endpoints` records.
However, the DNS system looks for and configures the following records:

** For `ExternalName` type services, `CNAME` records.
** For all other service types, `A` records for any endpoints that share a name
with the service.

[[headless-service-creation]]
==== Creating a headless service
Creating a headless service is similar to creating a standard service, but you
do not declare the `ClusterIP` address. To create a headless service, add the
`clusterIP: None` parameter value to the service YAML definition.

For example, for a group of pods that you want to be a part of the same cluster or service.

.List of pods
[source, bash]
----
$ oc get pods -o wide
NAME               READY  STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE    IP            NODE

frontend-1-68km5   1/1    Running   0          7m     172.17.0.6    node_1
----

You can define the headless service as:

  loadBalancer: {}
----

<1> Name of the headless service.
<2> Setting `clusterIP` variable to `None` declares a headless service.
<3> Selects all pods that have `frontend` label.

Also, headless service does not have any IP address of its own.

frontend-headless   ClusterIP   None             <none>        5432/TCP   10m
----

[[headless-service-endpoint-discovery]]
==== Endpoint discovery by using a headless service
The benefit of using a headless service is that you can discover a pod's IP
address directly. Standard services act as load balancer or proxy and give
access to the workload object by using the service name. With headless services,
the service name resolves to the set of IP addresses of the pods that are
grouped by the service.

When you look up the DNS `A` record for a standard service, you get the loadbalanced IP of the service.

[source, bash]
----
$ dig frontend.test A +search +short
172.30.232.77
----

But for a headless service, you get the list of IPs of individual pods.
[source, bash]
----
$ dig frontend-headless.test A +search +short
172.17.0.3
172.17.0.6
----

[NOTE]
====
For using a headless service with a StatefulSet and related use cases where you
need to resolve DNS for the pod during initialization and termination, set
`publishNotReadyAddresses` to `true` (the default value is `false`). When
`publishNotReadyAddresses` is set to `true`, it indicates that DNS
implementations must publish the `notReadyAddresses` of subsets for the
Endpoints associated with the Service.
====


[[labels]]

== Labels

Labels are used to organize, group, or select API objects.
For example, xref:pods[pods] are "tagged" with labels, and then
xref:services[services] use label selectors to identify the pods they
proxy to. This makes it possible for services to reference groups of
pods, even treating pods with potentially different containers
as related entities.

Most objects can include labels in their metadata. So labels can
be used to group arbitrarily-related objects; for example,
all of the xref:pods[pods], xref:services[services],
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#replication-controllers[replication
controllers], and
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configurations] of a particular application can be grouped.

Labels are simple key/value pairs, as in the following example:

====

[source,yaml]
----
labels:
  key1: value1
  key2: value2
----

====

Consider:

- A pod consisting of an *nginx* container, with the label
*role=webserver*.
- A pod consisting of an *Apache httpd* container, with the same label
*role=webserver*.

A service or replication controller that is defined to use pods with the
*role=webserver* label treats both of these pods as part of the same group.

The
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels[Kubernetes
documentation] has more information on labels.

[[endpoints]]

== Endpoints

The servers that back a service are called its endpoints, and are
specified by an object of type *Endpoints* with the same name as the
service. When a service is backed by pods, those pods are normally
specified by a label selector in the service specification, and
{product-title} automatically creates the Endpoints object pointing to
those pods.

In some cases, you may want to create a service but have it be backed
by external hosts rather than by pods in the {product-title} cluster.
In this case, you can leave out the `*selector*` field in the service,
and
xref:../../dev_guide/integrating_external_services.adoc#dev-guide-integrating-external-services[create
the Endpoints object manually].

Note that {product-title} will not let most users manually create an
Endpoints object that points to an IP address in the
