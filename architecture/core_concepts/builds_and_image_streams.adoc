[[builds]]
== Builds

A xref:../../dev_guide/builds.adoc#dev-guide-builds[build] is the process of transforming input
parameters into a resulting object. Most often, the process is used to transform
input parameters or source code into a runnable image. A
xref:../../dev_guide/builds.adoc#defining-a-buildconfig[BuildConfig] object is
the definition of the entire build process.

{product-title} leverages Kubernetes by creating Docker-formatted containers from build
images and pushing them to a
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#integrated-openshift-registry[container registry].

Build objects share common characteristics: inputs for a build, the need to
complete a build process, logging the build process, publishing resources from
successful builds, and publishing the final status of the build. Builds take
advantage of resource restrictions, specifying limitations on resources such as
CPU usage, memory usage, and build or pod execution time.

The {product-title} build system provides extensible support for _build
strategies_ that are based on selectable types specified in the build API. There
are three primary build strategies available:

- xref:docker-build[Docker build]
- xref:source-build[Source-to-Image (S2I) build]
- xref:custom-build[Custom build]

By default, Docker builds and S2I builds are supported.

The resulting object of a build depends on the builder used to create it. For
Docker and S2I builds, the resulting objects are runnable images. For Custom
builds, the resulting objects are whatever the builder image author has
specified.

Additionally, the
xref:pipeline-build[Pipeline build]
strategy can be used to implement sophisticated workflows:

- continuous integration
- continuous deployment

For a list of build commands, see the
xref:../../dev_guide/builds.adoc#dev-guide-builds[Developer's Guide].

For more information on how {product-title} leverages Docker for builds, see the
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/builds.md#how-it-works[upstream
documentation].

[[docker-build]]
=== Docker Build

The Docker build strategy invokes the https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/[docker build] command, and it therefore expects a repository with a *_Dockerfile_* and all required
artifacts in it to produce a runnable image.

[[source-build]]
=== Source-to-Image (S2I) Build

xref:../../creating_images/s2i.adoc#creating-images-s2i[Source-to-Image (S2I)] is a tool for
building reproducible, Docker-formatted container images. It produces ready-to-run images by
injecting application source into a container image and assembling a new image. The new image incorporates the base image (the builder) and built source
and is ready to use with the `docker run` command. S2I supports incremental
builds, which re-use previously downloaded dependencies, previously built
artifacts, etc.

The advantages of S2I include the following:

[horizontal]
Image flexibility:: S2I scripts can be written to inject application code into
almost any existing Docker-formatted container image, taking advantage of the existing ecosystem.
Note that, currently, S2I relies on `tar` to inject application
source, so the image needs to be able to process tarred content.

Speed:: With S2I, the assemble process can perform a large number of complex
operations without creating a new layer at each step, resulting in a fast
process. In addition, S2I scripts can be written to re-use artifacts stored in a
previous version of the application image, rather than having to download or
build them each time the build is run.

Patchability:: S2I allows you to rebuild the application consistently if an
underlying image needs a patch due to a security issue.

Operational efficiency:: By restricting build operations instead of allowing
arbitrary actions, as a *_Dockerfile_* would allow, the PaaS operator can avoid
accidental or intentional abuses of the build system.

Operational security:: Building an arbitrary *_Dockerfile_* exposes the host
system to root privilege escalation. This can be exploited by a malicious user
because the entire Docker build process is run as a user with Docker privileges.
S2I restricts the operations performed as a root user and can run the scripts
as a non-root user.

User efficiency:: S2I prevents developers from performing arbitrary `yum
install` type operations, which could slow down development iteration, during
their application build.

Ecosystem:: S2I encourages a shared ecosystem of images where you can leverage
best practices for your applications.

Reproducibility:: Produced images can include all inputs including specific versions
of build tools and dependencies. This ensures that the image can be reproduced
precisely.

[[custom-build]]
=== Custom Build

The Custom build strategy allows developers to define a specific builder image
responsible for the entire build process. Using your own builder image allows
you to customize your build process.

A xref:../../creating_images/custom.adoc#creating-images-custom[Custom builder image] is a plain Docker-formatted container image embedded with build process logic, for example for building RPMs or base images. The `openshift/origin-custom-docker-builder` image is available
on the
https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/openshift/origin-custom-docker-builder[Docker Hub] registry as an example implementation of a Custom builder image.

[[pipeline-build]]
=== Pipeline Build

The Pipeline build strategy allows developers to define a _Jenkins pipeline_
for execution by the Jenkins pipeline plugin.
The build can be started, monitored, and managed by
{product-title} in the same way as any other build type.

Pipeline workflows are defined in a Jenkinsfile,
either embedded directly in the build configuration,
or supplied in a Git repository and referenced by the build configuration.

The first time a project defines a build configuration using a Pipeline strategy,
{product-title} instantiates a Jenkins server to execute the pipeline.
Subsequent Pipeline build configurations
in the project share this Jenkins server.  For more details on how the Jenkins
server is deployed, see xref:../../install_config/configuring_pipeline_execution.adoc#overview[configuring pipeline execution].

[NOTE]
====
The Jenkins server is not automatically removed,
even if all Pipeline build configurations are deleted.  
It must be manually deleted by the user.
====

For more information about Jenkins Pipelines, please see the
link:https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/[Jenkins documentation].

[[image-streams]]
== Image Streams

An _image stream_ comprises any number of
xref:containers_and_images.adoc#docker-images[Docker-formatted container images] identified by tags.
It presents a single virtual view of related images, similar to an image repository, and may contain images from any of the following:

. Its own image repository in {product-title}'s
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#integrated-openshift-registry[integrated
registry]
. Other image streams
. Image repositories from external registries

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-online,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
Image streams can be used to automatically perform an action when new images are
created. Builds and deployments can watch an image stream to receive
notifications when new images are added and react by performing a build or
deployment, respectively.

For example, if a deployment is using a certain image and a new version of that
image is created, a deployment could be automatically performed.

[NOTE]
====
See the xref:../../dev_guide/managing_images.adoc#dev-guide-managing-images[Developer Guide] for details
on managing images and image streams.

[[image-stream-mappings]]
=== Image Stream Mappings

When the
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#integrated-openshift-registry[integrated
registry] receives a new image, it creates and sends an `*ImageStreamMapping*`
to {product-title}, providing the image's namespace (i.e., its project), name,
tag, and image metadata.

This information is used to create a new image (if it does not already exist)
and to tag the image into the image stream. {product-title} stores complete
metadata about each image, such as commands, entrypoint, and environment
variables. Images in {product-title} are immutable and the maximum name length
is 63 characters.

[NOTE]
====
See the xref:../../dev_guide/managing_images.adoc#dev-guide-managing-images[Developer Guide] for details
on manually tagging images.
