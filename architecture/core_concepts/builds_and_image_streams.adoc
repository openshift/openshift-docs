[[builds]]
== Builds
A xref:../../dev_guide/builds.adoc#dev-guide-builds[build] is the process of transforming input
parameters into a resulting object. Most often, the process is used to transform
input parameters or source code into a runnable image. A
xref:../../dev_guide/builds.adoc#defining-a-buildconfig[BuildConfig] object is
the definition of the entire build process.

OpenShift leverages Kubernetes by creating Docker containers from build images
and pushing them to a
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#integrated-openshift-registry[Docker registry].

Build objects share common characteristics: inputs for a build, the need to
complete a build process, logging the build process, publishing resources from
successful builds, and publishing the final status of the build. Builds take
advantage of resource restrictions, specifying limitations on resources such as
CPU usage, memory usage, and build or pod execution time.

The OpenShift build system provides extensible support for _build strategies_
that are based on selectable types specified in the build API. There are three
build strategies available:

- xref:docker-build[Docker build]
- xref:source-build[Source-to-Image (S2I) build]
- xref:custom-build[Custom build]

By default, Docker builds and S2I builds are supported.

The resulting object of a build depends on the builder used to create it. For
Docker and S2I builds, the resulting objects are runnable images. For Custom
builds, the resulting objects are whatever the builder image author has
specified.

For a list of build commands, see the
xref:../../dev_guide/builds.adoc#dev-guide-builds[Developer's Guide].

For more information on how OpenShift leverages Docker for builds, see the link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/builds.md#how-it-works[upstream documentation].

[[docker-build]]
=== Docker Build
The Docker build strategy invokes the plain
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/[docker build] command,
and it therefore expects a repository with a *_Dockerfile_* and all required
artifacts in it to produce a runnable image.

[[source-build]]
=== Source-to-Image (S2I) Build
xref:../../creating_images/s2i.adoc#creating-images-s2i[Source-to-Image (S2I)] is a tool for
building reproducible Docker images. It produces ready-to-run images by
injecting application source into a Docker image and assembling a new Docker
image.  The new image incorporates the base image (the builder) and built source
and is ready to use with the `docker run` command. S2I supports incremental
builds, which re-use previously downloaded dependencies, previously built
artifacts, etc.

The advantages of S2I include the following:

[horizontal]
Image flexibility:: S2I scripts can be written to inject application code into
almost any existing Docker image, taking advantage of the existing ecosystem.
Note that, currently, S2I relies on `tar` to inject application
source, so the image needs to be able to process tarred content.

Speed:: With S2I, the assemble process can perform a large number of complex
operations without creating a new layer at each step, resulting in a fast
process. In addition, S2I scripts can be written to re-use artifacts stored in a
previous version of the application image, rather than having to download or
build them each time the build is run.

Patchability:: S2I allows you to rebuild the application consistently if an
underlying image needs a patch due to a security issue.

Operational efficiency:: By restricting build operations instead of allowing
arbitrary actions, as a *_Dockerfile_* would allow, the PaaS operator can avoid
accidental or intentional abuses of the build system.

Operational security:: Building an arbitrary *_Dockerfile_* exposes the host
system to root privilege escalation. This can be exploited by a malicious user
because the entire Docker build process is run as a user with Docker privileges.
S2I restricts the operations performed as a root user and can run the scripts
as a non-root user.

User efficiency:: S2I prevents developers from performing arbitrary `yum
install` type operations, which could slow down development iteration, during
their application build.

Ecosystem:: S2I encourages a shared ecosystem of images where you can leverage
best practices for your applications.

[[custom-build]]
=== Custom Build
The Custom build strategy allows developers to define a specific builder image
responsible for the entire build process. Using your own builder image allows
you to customize your build process.

The xref:../../creating_images/custom.adoc#creating-images-custom[Custom builder image] is a plain
Docker image with embedded build process logic, such as building RPMs or
building base Docker images. The
https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/openshift/origin-custom-docker-builder/[openshift/origin-custom-docker-builder]
image is used by default.

[[image-streams]]

== Image Streams

An _image stream_ can be used to automatically perform an action, such as
updating a deployment, when a new image, such as a new version of the base image
that is used in that deployment, is created.

An image stream comprises one or more
xref:containers_and_images.adoc#docker-images[Docker images] identified by tags.
It presents a single virtual view of related images, similar to a Docker image
repository, and may contain images from any of the following:

. Its own image repository in OpenShift's integrated Docker Registry
. Other image streams
. Docker image repositories from external registries

OpenShift components such as builds and deployments can watch an image stream
to receive notifications when new images are added and react by performing
a build or a deployment.

[[image-stream-mappings]]

=== Image Stream Mappings
When the integrated OpenShift Docker Registry receives a new image, it creates
and sends an `*ImageStreamMapping*` to OpenShift. This informs OpenShift of the
image's namespace, name, tag, and Docker metadata. OpenShift uses this
information to create a new image (if it does not already exist) and to tag the
image into the image stream.  OpenShift stores complete metadata about each
image (e.g., command, entrypoint, environment variables, etc.). Note that images
in OpenShift are immutable. Also, note that the maximum name length is 63
characters.

The example `*ImageStreamMapping*` below results in an image being tagged as
`test/origin-ruby-sample:latest`.

=== Referencing Images in Image Streams

An `*ImageStreamTag*` is used to reference or retrieve an image for a given
image stream and tag. It uses the following convention for its name: `<image
stream name>:<tag>`.

An `*ImageStreamImage*` is used to reference or retrieve an image for a given
image stream and image name. It uses the following convention for its name:
`<image stream name>@<name>`.

The sample image below is from the *ruby* image stream and was
retrieved by asking for the `*ImageStreamImage*` with the name
*ruby@371829c*:

[[image-pull-policy]]

=== Image Pull Policy

Each container in a pod has a Docker image. Once you have created an image and
pushed it to a registry, you can then refer to it in the pod.

When OpenShift creates containers, it uses the container's `*imagePullPolicy*`
to determine if the image should be pulled prior to starting the container.
There are three possible values for `*imagePullPolicy*`:

- `*Always*` - always pull the image.
- `*IfNotPresent*` - only pull the image if it does not already exist on the node.
- `*Never*` - never pull the image.

If a container's `*imagePullPolicy*`
parameter is not specified, OpenShift sets it based on the image's tag:

. If the tag is *latest*, OpenShift defaults `*imagePullPolicy*` to `*Always*`.
. Otherwise, OpenShift defaults `*imagePullPolicy*` to `*IfNotPresent*`.

[[importing-tag-and-image-metadata]]

=== Importing Tag and Image Metadata
An image stream can be configured to import tag and image metadata from an image
repository in an external Docker image registry. See
xref:../infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-image-registry[Image Registry] for more
details.

[[tag-tracking]]

=== Tag Tracking
An image stream can also be configured so that a tag "tracks" another one. For
example, you can configure the *latest* tag to always refer to the current image
for the tag "2.0":

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "kind": "ImageStream",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "ruby"
  },
  "spec": {
    "tags": [
      {
        "name": "latest",
        "from": {
          "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
          "name": "2.0"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
----
====

====
----
$ oc tag ruby:latest ruby:2.0
----
====

[[tag-removal]]

=== Tag Removal

You can stop tracking a tag by removing it. For example, you can stop tracking
the *latest* tag you set above:

====
----
$ oc tag -d ruby:latest
----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The above command removes the tag from the image stream spec, but not from the
image stream status. The image stream spec is user-defined, whereas the image
stream status reflects the information the system has from the specification. To
remove a tag completely from an image stream:

----
$ oc delete istag/ruby:latest
----
====

You can also do the same using the `oc tag` command:

`oc tag ruby:latest ruby:2.0`

[[insecure-registries]]

=== Importing Images from Insecure Registries
An image stream can be configured to import tag and image metadata from an image
repository that is signed with a self-signed certificate or from one using plain
http instead of https. To do that, add `*openshift.io/image.insecureRepository*`
annotation set to `*true*`. This setting will bypass certificate validation when
connecting to registry.

====

[source,yaml]
----
kind: ImageStream
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: ruby
  annotations:
    openshift.io/image.insecureRepository: "true"
  spec:
    "dockerImageRepository: my.repo.com:5000/myimage
----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The above definition will only affect importing tag and image metadata. For this
image to be used in the cluster (be able to do `docker pull`) each node needs to
have docker configured with `--insecure-registry` flag. See Installing Docker in
xref:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.adoc#host-preparation[Host Preparation]
for information on the topic.
