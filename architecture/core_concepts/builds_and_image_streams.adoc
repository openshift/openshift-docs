[[builds]]
== Builds

A _build_ is the process of transforming input parameters into a resulting
object. Most often, the process is used to transform input parameters or source
code into a runnable image. A
xref:../../dev_guide/builds/index.adoc#defining-a-buildconfig[`BuildConfig`]
object is the definition of the entire build process.

{product-title} leverages Kubernetes by creating Docker-formatted containers from build
images and pushing them to a
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#integrated-openshift-registry[container registry].

Build objects share common characteristics: inputs for a build, the need to
complete a build process, logging the build process, publishing resources from
successful builds, and publishing the final status of the build. Builds take
advantage of resource restrictions, specifying limitations on resources such as
CPU usage, memory usage, and build or pod execution time.

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
The {product-title} build system provides extensible support for _build
strategies_ that are based on selectable types specified in the build API. There
are three primary build strategies available:

- xref:docker-build[Docker build]
- xref:source-build[Source-to-Image (S2I) build]
- xref:custom-build[Custom build]

By default, Docker builds and S2I builds are supported.

endif::[]
The resulting object of a build depends on the builder used to create it. For
Docker and S2I builds, the resulting objects are runnable images. For Custom
builds, the resulting objects are whatever the builder image author has
specified.

Additionally, the
xref:pipeline-build[Pipeline build]
strategy can be used to implement sophisticated workflows:

- continuous integration
- continuous deployment

For a list of build commands, see the
xref:../../dev_guide/builds/index.adoc#dev-guide-how-builds-work[Developer's Guide].

For more information on how {product-title} leverages Docker for builds, see the
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/builds.md#how-it-works[upstream
documentation].

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
[[docker-build]]
=== Docker Build

The Docker build strategy invokes the https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/[docker build] command, and it therefore expects a repository with a *_Dockerfile_* and all required
artifacts in it to produce a runnable image.
endif::[]

[[source-build]]
=== Source-to-Image (S2I) Build

xref:../../creating_images/s2i.adoc#creating-images-s2i[Source-to-Image (S2I)] is a tool for
building reproducible, Docker-formatted container images. It produces ready-to-run images by
injecting application source into a container image and assembling a new image. The new image incorporates the base image (the builder) and built source
and is ready to use with the `docker run` command. S2I supports incremental
builds, which re-use previously downloaded dependencies, previously built
artifacts, etc.

The advantages of S2I include the following:

[horizontal]
Image flexibility:: S2I scripts can be written to inject application code into
almost any existing Docker-formatted container image, taking advantage of the existing ecosystem.
Note that, currently, S2I relies on `tar` to inject application
source, so the image needs to be able to process tarred content.

Speed:: With S2I, the assemble process can perform a large number of complex
operations without creating a new layer at each step, resulting in a fast
process. In addition, S2I scripts can be written to re-use artifacts stored in a
previous version of the application image, rather than having to download or
build them each time the build is run.

Patchability:: S2I allows you to rebuild the application consistently if an
underlying image needs a patch due to a security issue.

Operational efficiency:: By restricting build operations instead of allowing
arbitrary actions, as a *_Dockerfile_* would allow, the PaaS operator can avoid
accidental or intentional abuses of the build system.

Operational security:: Building an arbitrary *_Dockerfile_* exposes the host
system to root privilege escalation. This can be exploited by a malicious user
because the entire Docker build process is run as a user with Docker privileges.
S2I restricts the operations performed as a root user and can run the scripts
as a non-root user.

User efficiency:: S2I prevents developers from performing arbitrary `yum
install` type operations, which could slow down development iteration, during
their application build.

Ecosystem:: S2I encourages a shared ecosystem of images where you can leverage
best practices for your applications.

Reproducibility:: Produced images can include all inputs including specific versions
of build tools and dependencies. This ensures that the image can be reproduced
precisely.

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
[[custom-build]]
=== Custom Build

The Custom build strategy allows developers to define a specific builder image
responsible for the entire build process. Using your own builder image allows
you to customize your build process.

A xref:../../creating_images/custom.adoc#creating-images-custom[Custom builder image] is a plain Docker-formatted container image embedded with build process logic, for example for building RPMs or base images. The `openshift/origin-custom-docker-builder` image is available
on the
https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/openshift/origin-custom-docker-builder[Docker Hub] registry as an example implementation of a Custom builder image.
endif::[]

[[pipeline-build]]
=== Pipeline Build

The Pipeline build strategy allows developers to define a _Jenkins pipeline_
for execution by the Jenkins pipeline plugin.
The build can be started, monitored, and managed by
{product-title} in the same way as any other build type.

Pipeline workflows are defined in a Jenkinsfile,
either embedded directly in the build configuration,
or supplied in a Git repository and referenced by the build configuration.

The first time a project defines a build configuration using a Pipeline
strategy, {product-title} instantiates a Jenkins server to execute the
pipeline.  Subsequent Pipeline build configurations in the project share this
Jenkins server.

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
For more details on how the Jenkins server is deployed and how to configure or
disable the autoprovisioning behavior, see
xref:../../install_config/configuring_pipeline_execution.adoc#install-config-configuring-pipeline-execution[Configuring Pipeline Execution].
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
For more details on how the Jenkins server is deployed and how to configure or
disable the autoprovisioning behavior, see
xref:../../admin_guide/osd_configuring_pipeline_execution.adoc#admin-guide-osd-configuring-pipeline-execution[Configuring Pipeline Execution].
endif::[]


[NOTE]
====
The Jenkins server is not automatically removed,
even if all Pipeline build configurations are deleted.
It must be manually deleted by the user.
====

For more information about Jenkins Pipelines, see the
link:https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/[Jenkins documentation].

endif::[]

[[image-streams]]
== Image Streams

An image stream and its associated tags provide an abstraction for referencing
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/containers_and_images.adoc#docker-images[Docker images] from within {product-title}.
The image stream and its tags allow you to see what images are available
and ensure that you are using the specific image you need even if the image in the repository changes.

Image streams do not contain actual image data, but present a single virtual view of related images, similar to an image repository.

You can  configure xref:../../dev_guide/builds/triggering_builds.adoc#image-change-triggers[Builds] and
xref:../../dev_guide/deployments/basic_deployment_operations.adoc#image-change-trigger[Deployments] to watch an image stream
for notifications when new images are added and react by performing a Build or Deployment, respectively.

For example, if a Deployment is using a certain image and a new version of that image is created,
a Deployment could be automatically performed to pick up the new version of the image.

However, if the image stream tag used by the Deployment or Build is not updated,
then even if the Docker image in the Docker registry is updated, the Build or Deployment will continue using the previous (presumably known good) image.

The source images can be stored in any of the following:

* {product-title}'s xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#integrated-openshift-registry[integrated
registry]
* An external registry, for example `registry.access.redhat.com` or `hub.docker.com`
* Other image streams in the {product-title} cluster

When you define an object that references an image stream tag (such as a or Build configuration or Deployment configuration), you point to an image stream tag, not the Docker repository. When you Build or Deploy your application, {product-title} queries the Docker repository using the image stream tag to locate the associated ID of the image and uses that
exact image.

The image stream metadata is stored in the etcd instance along with other cluster information.

The following image stream contains two tags: `34` which points to a Python v3.4 image and `35` which points to a Python v3.5 image:

Using image streams has several significant benefits:

* You can tag, rollback a tag, and quickly deal with images, without having to re-push using the command line.

* You can trigger Builds and Deployments when a new image is pushed to the registry. Also,
{product-title} has generic triggers for other resources (such as Kubernetes objects).

* You can xref:../../dev_guide/managing_images.adoc#importing-tag-and-image-metadata[mark a tag for periodic re-import].
If the source image has changed, that change is picked up and reflected in the image stream, which triggers the Build and/or Deployment flow, depending upon the Build or Deployment configuration.

* You can share images using fine-grained access control and quickly distribute images across your teams.

* If the source image changes, the image stream tag will still point to a known-good version of the image, ensuring that your application will not break unexpectedly.

* You can xref:../../admin_guide/manage_rbac.adoc#admin-guide-manage-rbac[configure security] around who can view and use the images through permissions on the image stream objects. 

* Users that lack permission to read or list images on the cluster level can still retrieve the images tagged in a project using image streams.


For a curated set of image streams, see the
link:https://github.com/openshift/library[OpenShift Image Streams and Templates
library].

When using image streams, it is important to understand what the image stream tag is pointing to and how changes to tags and images can affect you. For example:

* If your image stream tag points to a Docker image tag, you need to understand how that Docker image tag is updated. For example, a Docker image tag `docker.io/ruby:2.4` will probably always point to a v2.4 ruby image. But, a Docker image tag `docker.io/ruby:latest` will probably change with major versions. So, the Docker image tag that a image stream tag points to can tell you how stable the image stream tag will be, if you choose to reference it.

* If your image stream tag follows another image stream tag (it does not point directly to a docker image tag), it is possible that the image stream tag will be updated to follow a different image stream tag in the future. Again, this could result in picking up an incompatible version change.

=== Important terms

Docker repository::
A collection of related docker images and tags identifying them.
For example, the OpenShift Jenkins images are in a Docker repository:
+
----
docker.io/openshift/jenkins-2-centos7
----

Docker registry::
A content server that can store and service images from Docker repositories.
For example:
+
----
registry.access.redhat.com
----

Docker image::
 A specific set of content that can be run as a container. Usually associated with a particular tag within a Docker repository.

Docker image tag::
A label applied to a Docker image in a repository that distinguishes a specific image. For example, here *3.6.0* is a tag:

----
docker.io/openshift/jenkins-2-centos7:3.6.0
----

[NOTE]
====
A Docker image tag can be updated to point to new Docker image content at any time.
====

Docker image ID::
A SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) code that can be used to pull an image. For example:

----
docker.io/openshift/jenkins-2-centos7@sha256:ab312bda324
----

[NOTE]
====
A SHA image ID cannot change. A specific SHA identifier always references the exact same docker image content.
====

Image stream::
An {product-title} object that contains pointers to any number of Docker-formatted container images identified by tags. You can think of an image stream
as equivalent to a Docker repository.

Image stream tag::
A named pointer to an image in an image stream. An image stream tag is similar to a Docker image tag. See xref:image-stream-tag[Image Stream Tag] below.

Image stream image::
An image that allows you to retrieve a specific Docker image from a particular image stream where it is tagged.
An image stream image is an API resource object that pulls together some metadata about a particular image SHA identifier.
See xref:image-stream-image[Image Stream Images] below.

Image stream trigger::
A trigger that causes a specific action when an image stream tag changes. For example, importing can cause the value of the tag to change, which
causes a trigger to fire when there are Deployments, Builds, or other resources listening for those. See xref:image-stream-triggers[Image Stream Triggers] below.

=== Image Stream Images

An _image stream image_ points from within an image stream
to a particular image ID.

Image stream images allow you to retrieve metadata about an image from a particular image stream
where it is tagged.

Image stream image objects are automatically created in {product-title} whenever
you import or tag an image into the image stream. You should never have to explicitly define an
image stream image object in any image stream definition that you use to create image streams.

The image stream image consists of the image stream name and image ID from the repository, delimited by an `@` sign:

----
<image-stream-name>@<image-id>
----

To refer to the image in the
xref:image-stream-object-definition[image stream object example above], the image stream image looks like:

----
origin-ruby-sample@sha256:47463d94eb5c049b2d23b03a9530bf944f8f967a0fe79147dd6b9135bf7dd13d
----

[[image-stream-tag]]
=== Image Stream Tags

An _image stream tag_ is a named pointer to an image in an _image stream_. It
is often abbreviated as _istag_. An image stream tag is used to reference or retrieve
an image for a given image stream and tag.

Image stream tags can reference any local or externally
managed image. It contains a history of images represented as a stack of all
images the tag ever pointed to. Whenever a new or existing image is tagged
under particular image stream tag, it is placed at the first position in the
history stack. The image previously occupying the top position will be available at
the second position, and so forth. This allows for easy rollbacks to make tags point to
historical images again.

The following image stream tag is from the xref:image-stream-object-definition[image stream object example above]:

    tag: latest
----

Image stream tags can be _permanent_ tags or _tracking_ tags.

* _Permanent tags_ are version-specific tags that point to a particular version of an image, such as Python 3.5.

* _Tracking tags_ are reference tags that follow another image stream tag and could be updated in the future to change which image they follow, much like a symlink. Note that these new levels are not guaranteed to be backwards-compatible.
+
For example, the `latest` image stream tags that ship with {product-title} are tracking tags. This means consumers of the `latest` image stream tag will be updated to the newest level of the framework provided by the image when a new level becomes available. A `latest` image stream tag to `v3.6` could be changed to `v3.7` at any time. It is important to be aware that these `latest` image stream tags behave differently than the Docker `latest` tag. The `latest` image stream tag, in this case, does not point to the latest image in the Docker repository. It points to another image stream tag, which might not be the latest version of an image. For example, if the `latest` image stream tag points to `v3.2` of an image, when the `3.3` version is released, the `latest` tag is not automatically updated to `v3.3`, and remains at `v3.2` until it is manually updated to point to a `v3.3` image stream tag.
+
[NOTE]
====
Tracking tags are limited to a single image stream and cannot reference other image streams.
====

You can create your own image stream tags for your own needs. See the xref:../../dev_guide/managing_images.adoc#tag-naming[Recommended Tagging Conventions].

The image stream tag is composed of the name of the image stream and a tag, separated by a colon:

----
<image stream name>:<tag>
----

For example, to refer to the
`sha256:47463d94eb5c049b2d23b03a9530bf944f8f967a0fe79147dd6b9135bf7dd13d` image
in the  xref:image-stream-object-definition[image stream object example above], the image stream tag
would be:

----
origin-ruby-sample:latest
----


[[image-stream-triggers]]
=== Image Stream Change Triggers

Image stream triggers allow your Builds and Deployments to be automatically invoked when a new version of an upstream image is available.

//from FAQ
For example, Builds and Deployments can be automatically started when an image stream tag is modified.
This is achieved by monitoring that particular image stream tag and notifying the Build or Deployment when a change is detected.

include::dev_guide/deployments/basic_deployment_operations.adoc[tag=image-change-trig]

[[image-stream-mappings]]
=== Image Stream Mappings

When the
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#integrated-openshift-registry[integrated
registry] receives a new image, it creates and sends an image stream mapping
to {product-title}, providing the image's project, name,
tag, and image metadata.

[NOTE]
====
Configuring image stream mappings is an advanced feature.
====

This information is used to create a new image (if it does not already exist)
and to tag the image into the image stream. {product-title} stores complete
metadata about each image, such as commands, entry point, and environment
variables. Images in {product-title} are immutable and the maximum name length
is 63 characters.

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-online,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
[NOTE]

See the xref:../../dev_guide/managing_images.adoc#dev-guide-managing-images[Developer Guide] for details

=== Working with Image Streams

The following sections describe how to use image streams and image stream tags. For more information on working with
image streams, see xref:../../dev_guide/managing_images.adoc#dev-guide-managing-images[Managing Images].

[[image-stream-mappings-working-getting]]
==== Getting Information about Image Streams

To get general information about the image stream and detailed information about all the tags it is pointing to,
use the following command:

----
oc describe is/<image-name>
----

For example:

----
oc describe is/python

Name:			python
Namespace:		default
Created:		About a minute ago
Labels:			<none>
Annotations:		openshift.io/image.dockerRepositoryCheck=2017-10-02T17:05:11Z
Docker Pull Spec:	docker-registry.default.svc:5000/default/python
Image Lookup:		local=false
Unique Images:		1
Tags:			1

      About a minute ago
----

To get all the information available about particular image stream tag:

----
oc describe istag/<image-stream>:<tag-name>
----

For example:

----
oc describe istag/python:latest

[[image-stream-mappings-working-adding]]
==== Adding Additional Tags to an Image Stream

To add a tag that points to one of the existing tags, you can use the `oc tag` command:

----
oc tag <image-name:tag> <image-name:tag>
----

For example:

----
oc tag python:3.5 python:latest

Tag python:latest set to python@sha256:49c18358df82f4577386404991c51a9559f243e0b1bdc366df25.
----

Use the `oc describe` command to confirm the image stream has two tags, one (`3.5`) pointing at the external Docker image and another tag (`latest`) pointing to the same image because it was created based on the first tag.

----
oc describe is/python

Name:			python
Namespace:		default
Created:		5 minutes ago

[[image-stream-mappings-working-adding-tags]]
==== Adding Tags for an External Image

Use the `oc tag` command for all tag-related operations, such as adding tags pointing to internal or external images:

----
oc tag <repositiory/image> <image-name:tag>
----

For example, this command maps the `docker.io/python:3.6.0` image to the `3.6` tag in the `python` image stream.

----
oc tag docker.io/python:3.6.0 python:3.6
Tag python:3.6 set to docker.io/python:3.6.0.
----

If the external image is secured, you will need to create a secret with credentials for accessing that registry.
See xref:../../dev_guide/managing_images.adoc#private-registries[Importing Images from Private Registries] for more details.

[[image-stream-mappings-working-updating]]
==== Updating an Image Stream Tag

To update a tag to reflect another tag in an image stream:

----
oc tag <image-name:tag> <image-name:latest>
----

For example, the following updates the `latest` tag to reflect the `3.6` tag in an image stream:

----
oc tag python:3.6 python:latest
Tag python:latest set to python@sha256:438208801c4806548460b27bd1fbcb7bb188273d13871ab43f.
----

==== Removing Image Stream Tags from an Image Stream

To remove old tags from an image stream:

----
oc tag -d <image-name:tag>
----

For example:

----
oc tag -d python:3.5

Deleted tag default/python:3.5.
----


[[image-stream-mappings-working-periodic]]
==== Configuring Periodic Importing of Tags

When working with an external Docker registry, to periodically re-import an image (such as, to get latest security updates), use the `--scheduled` flag:

----
oc tag <repositiory/image> <image-name:tag> --scheduled
----

For example:

----
oc tag docker.io/python:3.6.0 python:3.6 --scheduled

Tag python:3.6 set to import docker.io/python:3.6.0 periodically.
----

This command causes {product-title} to periodically update this particular image stream tag. This period is a
xref:../../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-config-image-config[cluster-wide setting] set to 15 minutes by default.

To remove the periodic check, re-run above command but omit the `--scheduled` flag. This will reset its behavior to default.

----
oc tag <repositiory/image> <image-name:tag>
----
