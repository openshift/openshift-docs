One of the challenges of scaling Kubernetes environments is managing the lifecycle of a growing fleet. To meet that challenge, you can use the multicluster engine for Kubernetes operator. The operator delivers full lifecycle capabilities for managed {product-title} clusters and partial lifecycle management for other Kubernetes distributions. It is available in two ways:

* As a standalone operator that you install as part of your {product-title} or {oke} subscription
* As part of link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-advanced-cluster-management-for-kubernetes[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes]

== Cluster management with multicluster engine on {product-title}

When you enable multicluster engine on {product-title}, you gain the following capabilities:

* xref:../architecture/control-plane.adoc#hosted-control-planes-overview_control-plane[Hosted control planes], which is a feature that is based on the HyperShift project. With a centralized hosted control plane, you can operate {product-title} clusters in a hyperscale manner.
* Hive, which provisions self-managed {product-title} clusters to the hub and completes the initial configurations for those clusters.
* klusterlet agent, which registers managed clusters to the hub.
* Infrastructure Operator, which manages the deployment of the Assisted Service to orchestrate on-premise bare metal and vSphere installations of {product-title}, such as SNO on bare metal. The Infrastructure Operator includes xref:../scalability_and_performance/ztp_far_edge/ztp-deploying-far-edge-clusters-at-scale.adoc#ztp-challenges-of-far-edge-deployments_ztp-deploying-far-edge-clusters-at-scale[{ztp-first}], which fully automates cluster creation on bare metal and vSphere provisioning with GitOps workflows to manage deployments and configuration changes.
* Open cluster management, which provides resources to manage Kubernetes clusters.

The multicluster engine is included with your {product-title} support subscription and is delivered separately from the core payload. To start to use multicluster engine, you deploy the {product-title} cluster and then install the operator. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.8/html/clusters/cluster_mce_overview#mce-install-intro[Installing and upgrading multicluster engine operator].

== Cluster management with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management

If you need cluster management capabilities beyond what {product-title} with multicluster engine can provide, consider Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management. The multicluster engine is an integral part of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management and is enabled by default.
