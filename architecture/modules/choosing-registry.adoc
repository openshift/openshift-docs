= Choosing a registry

Container Registries are where you store container images so you can share them with others and make them available to the platform where they ultimately run. There are large, public container registries that offer free accounts, as well as premium versions that offer more storage and special features. You can also install your own registry that can be exclusive to your organization or selectively shared with others.

To get Red Hat images and certified partner images, you can draw from the Red Hat Registry. The Red Hat Registry is represented by two locations: registry.access.redhat.com (unauthenticated and deprecated) and registry.redhat.io (requires authentication). You can learn about the Red Hat and partner images in the Red Hat Registry from the https://www.google.com/url?q=https://access.redhat.com/containers/&sa=D&ust=1557950770715000[Red Hat Container Catalog]. Besides listing Red Hat container images, it also shows extensive information about the contents and quality of those images, including health scores based on applied security updates.

Large, public registries include https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hub.docker.com/&sa=D&ust=1557950770716000[Docker Hub] and https://www.google.com/url?q=https://quay.io/&sa=D&ust=1557950770716000[Quay.io]. The Quay.io registry is owned and managed by Red Hat. Many of the components used in OpenShift are stored in Quay.io, including container images and Operators used to deploy OpenShift itself. Quay.io also offers the means of storing other types of content, including Helm Charts.

If you want your own, private container registry, OpenShift itself includes a private container registry that is installed with OpenShift and runs on its cluster. Red Hat also offers a private version of the Quay.io registry called https://www.google.com/url?q=https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-quay&sa=D&ust=1557950770717000[Red Hat Quay]. Included with Red Hat Quay are features for geo replication, git build triggers, and Clair image scanning, among other features.

All of the registries mentioned here can require credentials for someone to download images from those registries. Some of those credentials are presented on a cluster-wide basis from OpenShift, while other credentials can represent an individual’s credentials.
