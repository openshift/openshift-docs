= Understanding Operators on the control plane

With CRI-O and the Kubelet running on every node, almost everything else can be managed on the control plane using Operators. Operators are among the most important components of OpenShift 4. Components added to the control plane using operators include critical networking pieces and credential services.

In OpenShift, Operators are the preferred method of packaging, deploying and managing services on the control plane, as well as providing those same advantages to applications running in user space. Operators integrate with Kubernetes APIs and CLI tools such as kubectl and oc commands. They provide the means of watching over an application, doing health checks, managing over-the-air updates, and making sure that the applications remains in the application’s chosen state.

The Operator overseeing Operators in an OpenShift cluster is the Cluster Version Operator.rude
