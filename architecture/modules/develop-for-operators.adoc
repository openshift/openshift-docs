= Develop for Operators

Packaging and deploying your application as an Operator is a particularly good idea if you are offering that application to be run by others. As noted earlier, Operators add a lifecycle component to your application that acknowledges that the job of running an application is not done when it is installed.

When you create an application as an Operator, you can build in your own knowledge of how to run and maintain the application going forward. You can build in features for upgrading the application, backing it up, scaling it, or keeping track of the state of the application. If done properly, maintenance tasks, like updating the Operator, can happen automatically and invisibly to those using the Operator.

An example of a useful Operator is one that is set up to automatically backup data at particular times. Having an Operator manage an applicationâ€™s backup at set times can save a system administrator from remembering to do it.

The bottom line is that any time an application needs nourishment that has typically been handled by a person in real time, that nourishment (like backing up data or rotating certificates) can be done automatically with an Operator.
