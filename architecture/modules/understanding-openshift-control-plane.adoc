= Understanding the OpenShift control plane

To the cluster administrator, the view of the inner workings of an OpenShift cluster goes through the control plane. The nodes in the control plane are master nodes that manage workloads on worker nodes. All upgrades to those nodes are handled centrally from the cluster itself through the Cluster Version Operator, the Machine Config Operator, and set of individual Operators.
