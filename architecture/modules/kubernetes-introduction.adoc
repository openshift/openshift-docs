= Introduction to Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The general concept of Kubernetes is fairly simple:

* Start with one or more worker nodes to run the container workloads
* Manage the deployment of those workloads from one or more master nodes
* Wrap containers in a deployment unit called a pod, to provide extra metadata with the container and possibly group several containers in a single deployment entity
* Create special kinds of assets. For example, services  are represented by a set of pods that and a policy that defines how they are accessed (so containers can connect to services that they need without needing to know IP addresses). Replication controllers indicate how many pod replicas should run at a time (allowing you to adapt to the amount of demand for an application).

In only a few years, Kubernetes has seen massive cloud and on-premise adoption. The open source development model has allowed many people to extend Kubernetes by implementing different networking, storage, authentication, and other technologies.
