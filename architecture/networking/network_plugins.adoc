== Overview

{product-title} supports the Kubernetes
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/network-plugins/#cni[Container Network
Interface (CNI)] as the interface between the {product-title} and Kubernetes.
Software defined network (SDN) plug-ins are a powerful and flexible way to match
network capabilities to your networking needs. Additional plug-ins that support
the CNI interface can be added as needed.

The following network plug-ins are currently supported by {product-title}:

[[openshift-sdn]]

== OpenShift SDN

{product-title} deploys a software-defined networking (SDN) approach for
connecting pods in an {product-title} cluster. The OpenShift SDN connects all
pods across all node hosts, providing a unified cluster network.

OpenShift SDN is installed and configured by default as part of the
Ansible-based installation procedure. See the
xref:../../architecture/networking/sdn.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-sdn[OpenShift SDN] section
for more information.
