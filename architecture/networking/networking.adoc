== Overview

Kubernetes ensures that pods are able to network with each other, and
allocates each pod an IP address from an internal network. This ensures all
containers within the pod behave as if they were on the same host. Giving each
pod its own IP address means that pods can be treated like physical hosts or
virtual machines in terms of port allocation, networking, naming, service
discovery, load balancing, application configuration, and migration.

Creating links between pods is unnecessary, and it is not recommended that
your pods talk to one another directly using the IP address. Instead, it is
recommended that you create a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[service], then interact
with the service.
