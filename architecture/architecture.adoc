= Components

{product-title} 4 consists of a number of key components making up the product stack.

== Infrastructure
* OpenShift API server
* Kubernetes API server
* Kubernetes controller manager
* Kubernetes nodes/kubelet
* CRI-O
* RedHat CoreOS
* Infrastructure Operators
* Networking (SDN/Router/DNS)
* Storage
* Monitoring + Telemetry
* Security
* Authorization/Authentication/Oauth
* Logging

== User facing components
* Workloads (Deployments, Jobs, ReplicaSets, etc)
* Operator Lifecycle Manager
* xref:../builds/architecture-component-builds.adoc#[Builds] - The build component provides an api and infrastructure for producing new container images using a variety of techniques including industry standard Dockerfiles and publishing them to either the cluster image registry, or an external registry.  It also provides integration with Jenkins based pipeline continuous integration workflows.
* xref:../registry/architecture-component-imageregistry.adoc#[Image Registry] - The image registry provides a scalable repository for storing and retrieving container images that are produced by and run on the cluster.  Image access is integrated with the clusterâ€™s role-based access controls and user authentication system.
* xref:../openshift_images/images-understand.adoc#architecture-component-imagestreams[Image streams] - The imagestream API provides an abstraction over container images that exist in registries.  It allows workloads to reference an image indirectly, retains a history of the images that have been referenced, and allows notification when an image is updated with a new version.

== User interface
* Web Console
* CLI
* Rest API


== Observability
