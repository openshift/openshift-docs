OpenShift v3 is a layered system designed to expose underlying
https://www.docker.com/[Docker] and http://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] concepts
as accurately as possible, with a focus on easy composition of applications by a
developer. For example, install Ruby, push code, and add MySQL.

Unlike OpenShift v2, more flexibility of configuration is exposed after creation
in all aspects of the model. The concept of an application as a separate object
is removed in favor of more flexible composition of "services", allowing two web
containers to reuse a database or expose a database directly to the edge of the
network.

ifdef::atomic-registry[]
{product-title} is based on OpenShift technology which features an embedded registry
based on the upstream link:https://github.com/docker/distribution[Docker distribution, role="external", window="_blank"] library.
OpenShift provides the following capabilities:

* A user-focused link:infrastructure_components/web_console.html[web console].
* Global link:additional_concepts/authentication.html[identity provider authentication].
* A link:core_concepts/projects_and_users.html[project namespace] model to
enable teams to collaborate through link:additional_concepts/authorization.html[role-based access control (RBAC)]
authorization.
* A link:infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html[Kubernetes-based cluster]
to manage services.
* An image abstraction called link:core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html[image streams] to enhance image management.

== What Are the Layers?

Docker provides the abstraction for packaging and creating Linux-based,
lightweight
link:core_concepts/containers_and_images.html#containers[containers]. Kubernetes
provides the
link:infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html[cluster
management] and orchestrates Docker containers on multiple hosts.

OpenShift adds:

- Source code management,
link:core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#builds[builds], and
link:core_concepts/deployments.html[deployments] for developers
- Managing and promoting
link:core_concepts/containers_and_images.html#docker-images[images] at scale
as they flow through your system
- Application management at scale
- Team and user tracking for organizing a large developer organization

== What Is the OpenShift Architecture?

OpenShift has a microservices-based architecture of smaller, decoupled units
that work together. It can run on top of (or alongside) a
link:infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html[Kubernetes
cluster], with data about the objects stored in
link:infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#master[etcd], a
reliable clustered key-value store. Those services are broken down by function:

- link:../rest_api/index.html[REST APIs], which expose each of the
link:core_concepts/index.html[core objects].
- Controllers, which read those APIs, apply changes to other objects, and report
status or write back to the object.

Users make calls to the REST API to change the state of the system. Controllers
use the REST API to read the user's desired state, and then try to bring the
other parts of the system into sync. For example, when a user requests a
link:core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#builds[build] they create a
"build" object. The build controller sees that a new build has been created, and
runs a process on the cluster to perform that build. When the build completes,
the controller updates the build object via the REST API and the user sees that
their build is complete.

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-online,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
The controller pattern means that much of the functionality in OpenShift is
extensible. The way that builds are run and launched can be customized
independently of how images are managed, or how
link:core_concepts/deployments.html[deployments] happen. The controllers are
performing the "business logic" of the system, taking user actions and
transforming them into reality. By customizing those controllers or replacing
them with your own logic, different behaviors can be implemented. From a system
administration perspective, this also means the API can be used to script common
administrative actions on a repeating schedule. Those scripts are also
controllers that watch for changes and take action. OpenShift makes the ability
to customize the cluster in this way a first-class behavior.

To make this possible, controllers leverage a reliable stream of changes to the
system to sync their view of the system with what users are doing. This event
stream pushes changes from etcd to the REST API and then to the controllers as
soon as changes occur, so changes can ripple out through the system very quickly
and efficiently. However, since failures can occur at any time, the controllers
must also be able to get the latest state of the system at startup, and confirm
that everything is in the right state. This resynchronization is important,
because it means that even if something goes wrong, then the operator can
restart the affected components, and the system double checks everything before
continuing. The system should eventually converge to the user's intent, since
the controllers can always bring the system into sync.

== How Is OpenShift Secured?

The OpenShift and Kubernetes APIs
link:additional_concepts/authentication.html[authenticate] users who present
credentials, and then link:additional_concepts/authorization.html[authorize]
them based on their role. Both developers and administrators can be
authenticated via a number of means, primarily
link:additional_concepts/authentication.html#oauth[OAuth tokens] and SSL
certificate authorization.

Developers (clients of the system) typically make REST API calls from a
link:../cli_reference/index.html[client program] like `oc` or to the
link:infrastructure_components/web_console.html[web console] via their browser,
and use OAuth bearer tokens for most communications. Infrastructure components
(like nodes) use client certificates generated by the system that contain their
identities. Infrastructure components that run in containers use a token
associated with their link:../dev_guide/service_accounts.html[service account]
to connect to the API.

Authorization is handled in the OpenShift policy engine, which defines actions
like "create pod" or "list services" and groups them into roles in a policy
document. Roles are bound to users or groups by the user or group identifier.
When a user or service account attempts an action, the policy engine checks for
one or more of the roles assigned to the user (e.g., cluster administrator or
administrator of the current project) before allowing it to continue.

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-online,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
Since every container that runs on the cluster is associated with a service
account, it is also possible to associate
link:../dev_guide/secrets.html[secrets] to those service accounts and have them
automatically delivered into the container. This enables the infrastructure to
manage secrets for pulling and pushing images, builds, and the deployment
components, and also allows application code to easily leverage those secrets.
