== Overview
A build is a process of transforming input parameters, typically source code, into a resulting object, typically a runnable image.

== BuildConfig
The `BuildConfig` object is the definition of the entire build process. It consists of the following elements:

[horizontal]
triggers:: Define policies used for automatically invoking builds:
GitHub webhooks::: GitHub specific webhooks that specify which repository
changes, such as a new commit, should invoke a new build. This trigger is
specific to the GitHub API.
generic webhooks::: Similar to GitHub webhooks in that they invoke a new build
whenever it gets a notification. The difference is its payload is slightly
different than GitHub's.
image change::: Defines a trigger which is invoked upon availability of a new
image in the specified ImageRepository.

parameters::
source::: Describes the SCM used to locate the sources. Currently only supports
Git.
strategy::: Describes which build type is invoked along with build type specific
details.
output::: Describes the resulting image name, tag, and registry to which the
image should be pushed.

There are three available link:openshift_model.html#build-strategies[build strategies]:

* link:#docker-build[Docker build]
* link:#sti-build[STI build]
* link:#custom-build[Custom build]

The resulting object depends on which builder is used to create the image.

[#docker-build]
== Docker Build
Docker builds invoke the plain https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#build[docker build] command, and therefore expect a repository with a `Dockerfile` and all required directories.

[#sti-build]
== STI Build
link:../../creating_images/sti.html[Source-to-image (STI)] is a tool for
building reproducible Docker images. It produces ready-to-run images by
injecting a user source into a docker image and assembling a new docker image.
The new image incorporates the base image and built source, and is ready to use
with the `docker run` command. STI supports incremental builds which re-use
previously downloaded dependencies, previously built artifacts, etc.

*What are the goals of STI?*

[horizontal]
Image flexibility:: STI allows you to use almost any existing Docker image as
the base for your application. STI scripts can be written to layer application
code onto almost any existing Docker image, so you can take advantage of the
existing ecosystem. Note that currently STI relies on `tar` and `untar` to
inject application source so the image needs to be able to process tarred
content.

Speed:: Adding layers as part of a *_Dockerfile_* can be slow. With STI, the
assemble process can perform a large number of complex operations without
creating a new layer at each step. In addition, STI scripts can be written to
re-use dependencies stored in a previous version of the application image rather
than re-downloading them each time the build is run.

Patchability:: If an underlying image needs to be patched due to a security
issue, OpenShift can use STI to rebuild your application on top of the patched
builder image.

Operational efficiency:: By restricting build operations instead of allowing
arbitrary actions such as in a *_Dockerfile_*, the PaaS operator can avoid
accidental or intentional abuses of the build system.

Operational security:: Allowing users to build arbitrary an *_Dockerfile_*
exposes the host system to root privilege escalation by a malicious user because
the entire docker build process is run as a user with docker privileges. STI
restricts the operations performed as a root user, and can run the scripts as an
individual user

User efficiency:: STI prevents developers from falling into a trap of performing
arbitrary `yum install` type operations during their application build, which
would result in slow development iteration.

Ecosystem:: Encourages a shared ecosystem of images with best practices you can
leverage for your applications.

[#custom-build]
== Custom Build
Custom builds are the most sophisticated version of builds, allowing developers to define a builder image which is responsible for the entire process of the build. The custom builder image is a plain Docker image within which the author embeds the logic of the desired build process, such as building RPMs or building
base Docker images.

[#using-docker-credentials-for-pushing-images]
== Using Docker Credentials for Pushing Images

In case you want to push the output image into private Docker registry that
requires authentication or Docker Hub, you must supply a `.dockercfg` file
with valid Docker registry credentials.

The *_.dockercfg_* JSON file usually exists in your home directory and has
following format:

====

----
{
	"https://index.docker.io/v1/": { <1>
		"auth": "YWRfbGzhcGU6R2labnRib21ifTE=", <2>
		"email": "foo@bar.com" <3>
	}
}
----

<1> URL of the registry.
<2> Encrypted password.
<3> Email address for the login.
====

You can define multiple Docker registries entries in this file. You can also add
authentication entries to this file by running the `docker login` command. The
file will be created if it does not exist.

Kubernetes provides the
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/design/secrets.md[Secret]
resource, which you can use to store your passwords and configuration. You must
create the `*Secret*` first before builds can use your *_.dockercfg_* file for
pushing the output image. The `*data*` field for the `*Secret*` object must
contain the `*dockercfg*` key with the value set to the base64-encoded content
of the *_.dockercfg_* file. For example:

====

----
{
  "apiVersion": "v1beta3",
  "kind": "Secret",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "dockerhub"
  },
  "data": {
    "dockercfg": "6yJodHRwc1ovL2zuZGV4LmRvY21lci5aby92MS8iOnsiYXV0aCI6ImJXWnZhblJwYXpwdVoybGxkR2d4TUE9PSIsImVtYWlsIj8ibWlAbWlmby5zayJ9fQ=="
  }
}

----
====

To create the `*Secret*` from a *_secret.json_* file, for example, you can use
the following command:

====

----
$ osc create -f secret.json
----
====

Once you have the `*Secret*` created, you can add a `PushSecretName` field into
`Output` section inside the `BuildConfig` and set it to the name of the
`*Secret*` that you created, in this case `*dockerhub*`.

[#using-private-repositories-for-builds]
== Using private repositories for builds

If you want to build your application from a private repository you must
supply valid credentials. Currently only SSH key based authentication is supported.
The keys used to access that repository live in `$HOME/.ssh/` directory.
They are usually named `id_dsa.pub`, `id_ecdsa.pub`, `id_ed25519.pub` or `id_rsa.pub`.
If you don't have any, you can generate them with the following command:

====

----
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
----
====

Once that's done you're going to get two files: one containing your public key (as
explained above) and one containing a corresponding private key (one of `id_dsa`, `id_ecdsa`,
`id_ed25519` or `id_rsa`). With both of these in place you should consult your
source control management (SCM) system's manual on how to upload the public key.
The private one will be used to access your private repository.

Kubernetes provides the
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/design/secrets.md[Secret]
resource, which you can use to store your keys. You must create the `*Secret*` first
before builds can use your ssh key for accessing your private repository.
The `*data*` field for the `*Secret*` object must contain your private key
with the value set to the base64-encoded content of that file. For example:

====

----
$ base64 -w 0 $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa
6yJodHRwc1ovL2zuZGV4LmRvY21lci5aby92MS8iOnsiYXV0aCI6ImJXWnZhblJwYXpwdVoybGxkR2d4TUE9PSIsImVtYWlsIj8ibWlAbWlmby5zayJ9fQ==
----
====

Copy the value returned from `base64` command and paste it into `ssh-privatekey` field
in `*_secret.json_*` file:

====

----
{
  "apiVersion": "v1beta3",
  "kind": "Secret",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "scmsecret"
  },
  "data": {
    "ssh-privatekey": "6yJodHRwc1ovL2zuZGV4LmRvY21lci5aby92MS8iOnsiYXV0aCI6ImJXWnZhblJwYXpwdVoybGxkR2d4TUE9PSIsImVtYWlsIj8ibWlAbWlmby5zayJ9fQ=="
  }
}

----
====

You can then create the `*Secret*` from the *_secret.json_* file using the following command:

====

----
$ osc create -f secret.json
----
====

Once you have the `*Secret*` created, you can add a `SourceSecretName` field into
`Source` section inside the `BuildConfig` and set it to the name of the
`*Secret*` that you created, in this case `*scmsecret*`:

====

----
{
  "apiVersion": "v1beta3",
  "kind": "BuildConfig",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "sample-build",
  },
  "parameters": {
    "output": {
      "to": {
        "name": "sample-image"
      }
    },
    "source": {
      "git": {
        "uri": "git@repository.com:user/app.git"
      },
      "sourceSecretName": "scmsecret",
      "type": "Git"
    },
    "strategy": {
      "stiStrategy": {
        "from": {
          "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
          "name": "python-33-centos7:latest"
        }
      },
      "type": "STI"
    }
  }
----
====

[NOTE]
====
The URL of private repository is usually in the form `git@example.com:username/repository`
====
