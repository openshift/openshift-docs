== Containers

The basic units of OpenShift applications are called containers. Linux
container technologies are lightweight mechanisms for isolating
running processes so that they are limited to interacting with only
their designated resources. Many application instances can be running
in containers on a single host without visibility into each others'
processes, files, network, and so on. Typically, each container
provides a single service (often called a "micro-service"), such as a
web server or a database, though containers can be used for arbitrary
workloads.

You can read further about container technology
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/1353593[here]. The Linux kernel
has been incorporating capabilities for container technologies for
years. More recently the link:https://www.docker.com/whatisdocker/[Docker
project] has developed a convenient management interface for Linux
containers on a host. OpenShift and Kubernetes add the ability to
orchestrate Docker containers across multi-host installations.

Though you do not directly interact with Docker tools when using
OpenShift, understanding Docker's capabilities and terminology is
important for understanding its role in OpenShift and how your
applications function inside of containers. Docker is available
as part of RHEL 7, as well as CentOS and Fedora, so you can
experiment with it separately from OpenShift. Refer to the article
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/881893[Get Started with Docker
Formatted Container Images on Red Hat Systems] for a guided introduction.

== Docker Images

Docker containers are based on Docker images. A Docker image is a
binary that includes all of the requirements for running a single Docker
container, as well as metadata describing its needs and capabilities. You
can think of it as a packaging technology. Docker containers only
have access to resources defined in the image, unless you give the
container additional access when creating it. By deploying the same
image in multiple containers across multiple hosts and load balancing
between them, OpenShift can provide redundancy and horizontal scaling
for a service packaged into an image.

You can use Docker directly to build images, but OpenShift also supplies
builders that assist with creating an image by adding your code or
configuration to existing images.

Since applications develop over time, a single image name can actually
refer to many different versions of the "same" image. Each different
image is referred to uniquely by its hash (a long hexadecimal number
e.g. `fd44297e2ddb050ec4f...`) which is usually shortened to 12
characters (e.g. `fd44297e2ddb`). Rather than version numbers, Docker
allows applying tags (such as `v1`, `v2.1`, `GA`, or the default `latest`)
in addition to the image name to further specify the image desired, so
you may see the same image referred to as `centos` (implying the `latest`
tag), `centos:centos7`, or `fd44297e2ddb`.

== Docker registries

A Docker registry is a Docker image repository: a service
for storing and retrieving Docker images. The most famous is the
link:https://registry.hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub], but Docker may also use
private or third-party repositories. Red Hat provides a Docker registry at
`registry.access.redhat.com` for subscribers. OpenShift can also supply
its own internal registry for managing custom Docker images.

The relationship between Docker containers, images, and registries is
depicted in the following diagram:
