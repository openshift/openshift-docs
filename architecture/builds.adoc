== Overview
A build is a process of transforming input parameters, typically source code, into a resulting object, typically a runnable image.

== BuildConfig
The `BuildConfig` object is the definition of the entire build process. It consists of the following elements:

* _triggers_: Define policies used for automatically invoking builds.
** _GitHub webhooks_: GitHub specific webhooks that specify which repository changes, such as a new commit, should invoke a new build. This trigger is specific to the GitHub API.
** _generic webhooks_: Similar to GitHub webhooks in that they invoke a new build whenever it gets a notification. The difference is its payload is slightly different than GitHub's.
** _image change_: Defines a trigger which is invoked upon availability of a new image in the specified ImageRepository.
* _parameters_
** _source_: Describes the SCM used to locate the sources. Currently only supports Git.
** _strategy_: Describes which build type is invoked along with build type specific details.
** _output_: Describes the resulting image name, tag, and registry to which the image should be pushed.

There are three available link:openshift_model.html#build-strategies[build strategies]:

* link:#docker-build[Docker build]
* link:#sti-build[STI build]
* link:#custom-build[Custom build]

The resulting object depends on which builder is used to create the image.

[#docker-build]
== Docker Build
Docker builds invoke the plain https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#build[docker build] command, and therefore expect a repository with a `Dockerfile` and all required directories.

[#sti-build]
== STI Build
STI builds are a replacement for the OpenShift v2-like developer experience. The developer specifies the repository where their project is located and a builder image, which defines the language and framework used for writing their application. STI then assembles a new image which runs the application defined by the source using the framework defined by the builder image.

[#custom-build]
== Custom Build
Custom builds are the most sophisticated version of builds, allowing developers to define a builder image which is responsible for the entire process of the build. The custom builder image is a plain Docker image within which the author embeds the logic of the desired build process, such as building RPMs or building
base Docker images.
