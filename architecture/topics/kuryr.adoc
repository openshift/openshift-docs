Kuryr
(or more specifically Kuryr-Kubernetes) is an SDN solution built using
link:https://github.com/containernetworking/cni[CNI] and
link:https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/[OpenStack Neutron]. Its
advantages include being able to use a wide range of Neutron SDN backends and
providing interconnectivity between Kubernetes pods and OpenStack virtual
machines (VMs).

Kuryr-Kubernetes and {product-title} integration is primarily designed for
{product-title} clusters running on OpenStack VMs.

*OpenStack Deployment Requirements*

Kuryr SDN has some requirements regarding configuration of OpenStack it will be
using. In particular:

* Minimal service set is Keystone and Neutron.
* A LBaaS service is required. It can be either
  link:https://docs.openstack.org/octavia/latest/[Octavia] (with all of its own
  dependencies) or deprecated Neutron-LBaaS v2.

*kuryr-controller*

kuryr-controller is a service responsible for watching {product-title} API for
new pods being spawned and creating Neutron resources for them. For example,
when a pod gets created, kuryr-controller will notice that and call OpenStack
Neutron to create a new port. Then, information about that port (or VIF) is
saved into the pod's annotations. kuryr-controller is also able to use
precreated port pools for faster pod creation.

Currently, kuryr-controller must be run as a single service instance, so it is
modeled in {product-title} as `Deployment` with `replicas=1`. It requires
access to the underlying OpenStack service APIs.

[[architecture-additional-concepts-kuryr-cni]]
*kuryr-cni*

kuryr-cni is (currently) a dummy container that is responsible for installing
and configuring Kuryr CNI plug-in on {product-title} nodes. It should be
running on every node, so it is modelled in {product-title} as `DaemonSet`.

Kuryr CNI plug-in is called every time a new container that needs networking is
spawned on the host. When that happens, the CNI plug-in starts watching
{product-title} API to wait for kuryr-controller providing VIF annotation. When
annotation is noticed, CNI plug-in uses this info to plug the VIF to the
containers.
