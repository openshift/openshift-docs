OpenShift SDN provides three SDN plug-ins for configuring the pod network:

* The *ovs-subnet* plug-in is the original plug-in, which provides a "flat" pod
network where every pod can communicate with every other pod and service.
* The *ovs-multitenant* plug-in provides project-level isolation for
pods and services. Each project receives a unique Virtual Network ID (VNID)
that identifies traffic from pods assigned to the project. Pods from different
projects cannot send packets to or receive packets from pods and services of a
different project.
+
However, projects that receive VNID 0 are more privileged in that they are
allowed to communicate with all other pods, and all other pods can communicate
with them. In {product-title} clusters, the *default* project has VNID 0. This
facilitates certain services, such as the load balancer, to communicate with
all other pods in the cluster and vice versa.
* The *ovs-networkpolicy* plug-in (currently in Tech Preview) allows project
administrators to configure their own isolation policies using
xref:../../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#admin-guide-networking-networkpolicy[NetworkPolicy objects].
