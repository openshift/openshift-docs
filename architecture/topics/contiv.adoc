link:http://contiv.github.io[Contiv] is an open-source networking plug-in module
for container infrastructure. Contiv provides an infrastructure for
application-oriented network policies and support for a range of multiple
networking modes. These include:

- A configurable set of overlay networking modes.
- Physical networking modes.
- Support for industry-leading hardware.

{product-title} can use Contiv for networking containers instead of the default
xref:../../architecture/networking/sdn.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-sdn[OpenShift
SDN].

[NOTE]
====
Contiv configuration instructions are forthcoming.

*Architecture*

Each node within the cluster runs a Contiv agent called *netplugin* while the
master hosts run the Contiv controller (called *netmaster*), along with
supporting control plane components (such as *etcd*).

Together the components of Contiv (*netmaster* and *netplugin*) handle key
networking functions for {product-title} including:

- Assigning IP addresses to each container pod on each cluster node.
- Creating and managing multiple separate container network instances for
different groups of containers.
- Configuring the network forwarding layer components for layer two or layer three
forwarding.
- Configuring and enforcing a range of network policies.
- Providing management interfaces (including both CLI and GUI) to configure and
manage Contiv-specific features and configurations.
- Providing an infrastructure for role-based controls that allow for multiple
role-based network operations workflows.

Contiv uses the
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/network-plugins/#cni[Container Network
Interface (CNI)] to interface with {product-title} and Kubernetes. A key value
store based on *etcd* is used to store Contiv-specific state information. This
is in addition to and separate from the instance of *etcd* used by other
components in the system, including {product-title} itself.
