== Debugging connectivity issues from external traffic to VPC

If the connection to the Amazon RDS instance is not accessible, take the following steps:
 
* Get the VPC of the database instance from the AWS Amazon RDS dashboard  
and trace to the associated routing table.  

* Verify that the routing table has a reference to the internet gateway. If there is no reference to the 
internet gateway, add the reference so that external traffic is allowed.
