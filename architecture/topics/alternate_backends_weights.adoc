A route is usually associated with one service through the `to:` token with
`kind: Service`. All of the requests to the route are handled by endpoints in
the service based on the xref:load-balancing[load balancing strategy].

It is possible to have as many as four services supporting the route. The
portion of requests that are handled by each service is governed by the service
`weight`.

The first service is entered using the `to:` token as before, and up to three
additional services can be entered using the `alternateBackend:` token. Each
service must be `kind: Service` which is the default.

Each service has a `weight` associated with it. The portion of requests
handled  by the service is `weight` / `sum_of_all_weights`. When a service has
more than one  endpoint, the service's weight is distributed among the endpoints
with each endpoint getting at least 1. If the service `weight` is 0 each
of the service's endpoints will get 0.

The `weight` must be in the range 0-256. The default is 1. When the `weight` is
0 no requests are passed to the service. If all services have `weight` 0,
requests are returned with a 503 error.  When a service has no endpoints, the weight
is effectively 0.

When using `alternateBackends` also use the `roundrobin` load balancing strategy to ensure requests are distributed
as expected to the services based on `weight`. `roundrobin` can be set for a
route using a xref:route-specific-annotations[route annotation], or for the
router in general using an environment variable.

The following is an example route configuration using alternate backends for
xref:../../dev_guide/deployments/advanced_deployment_strategies.adoc#advanced-deployment-a-b-deployment[A/B
deployments].

.A Route with alternateBackends and weights:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: route-alternate-service
  annotations:
    haproxy.router.openshift.io/balance: roundrobin  <1>
spec:
  host: www.example.com
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: service-name  <2>
    weight: 20          <4>
  alternateBackends:
  - kind: Service
    name: service-name2 <3>
    weight: 10          <4>
    kind: Service
    name: service-name3 <3>
    weight: 10          <4>
----

<1> This route uses `roundrobin` xref:load-balancing[load balancing strategy]
<2> The first service name is `service-name` which may have 0 or more pods
<3> The alternateBackend services may also have 0 or more pods
<4> The total `weight` is 40. `service-name` will get 20/40 or 1/2 of the requests,
`service-name2` and `service-name3` will each get 1/4 of the requests, assuming each
service has 1 or more endpoints.
