== Routers

An {product-title} administrator can deploy _routers_ to nodes in an
{product-title} cluster, which enable routes
xref:../../dev_guide/routes.adoc#creating-routes[created by developers] to be
used by external clients. The routing layer in {product-title} is pluggable, and
several xref:../../architecture/networking/assembly_available_router_plugins.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-router-plugins[router plug-ins] are provided and
supported by default.

A router uses the service selector to find the
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[service] and the endpoints backing
the service.
When both router and service provide load balancing,
{product-title} uses the router load balancing.
A router detects relevant changes in the IP addresses of its services
and adapts its configuration accordingly.
This is useful for custom routers to communicate modifications
of API objects to an external routing solution.

The path of a request starts with the DNS resolution of a host name
to one or more routers.
The suggested method is to define a cloud domain with
a wildcard DNS entry pointing to one or more virtual IP (VIP)
addresses backed by multiple router instances.
Routes using names and addresses outside the cloud domain require
configuration of individual DNS entries.

When there are fewer VIP addresses than routers, the routers corresponding
to the number of addresses are _active_ and the rest are _passive_.
A passive router is also known as a _hot-standby_ router.
For example, with two VIP addresses and three routers,
you have an "active-active-passive" configuration.

Routes can be
xref:router-sharding[sharded]
among the set of routers.
Administrators can set up sharding on a cluster-wide basis
and users can set up sharding for the namespace in their project.
Sharding allows the operator to define multiple router groups.
Each router in the group serves only a subset of traffic.

{product-title} routers provide external host name mapping and load balancing
of xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[service] end points over protocols that
pass distinguishing information directly to the router; the host name
must be present in the protocol in order for the router to determine
where to send it.

Router plug-ins assume they can bind to host ports 80 (HTTP)
and 443 (HTTPS), by default.
This means that routers must be placed on nodes
where those ports are not otherwise in use.
Alternatively, a router can be configured to listen
on other ports by setting the `ROUTER_SERVICE_HTTP_PORT`
and `ROUTER_SERVICE_HTTPS_PORT` environment variables.

Because a router binds to ports on the host node,
only one router listening on those ports can be on each node
if the router uses host networking (the default).
Cluster networking is configured such that all routers
can access all pods in the cluster.

Routers support the following protocols:

- HTTP
- HTTPS (with SNI)
- WebSockets
- TLS with SNI

[NOTE]
====
WebSocket traffic uses the same route conventions and supports the same TLS
termination types as other traffic.
====

For a secure connection to be established, a xref:ciphers[cipher] common to the
client and server must be negotiated. As time goes on, new, more secure ciphers
become available and are integrated into client software. As older clients
become obsolete, the older, less secure ciphers can be dropped. By default, the
router supports a broad range of commonly available clients. The router can be
configured to use a selected set of ciphers that support desired clients and
do not include the less secure ciphers.
