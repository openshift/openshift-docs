== Packet Flow

Suppose you have two containers, A and B, where the peer virtual Ethernet device
for container A's *eth0* is named *vethA* and the peer for container B's *eth0*
is named *vethB*.

[NOTE]
====
If the Docker service's use of peer virtual Ethernet devices is not already familiar to you,
see https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/dockernetworks/[Docker's advanced networking
documentation].

Now suppose first that container A is on the local host and container B is also
on the local host. Then the flow of packets from container A to container B is
as follows:

*_eth0_* _(in A's netns) -> *vethA* -> *br0* -> *vethB* -> *eth0* (in B's netns)_

Next, suppose instead that container A is on the local host and container B is
on a remote host on the cluster network. Then the flow of packets from container
A to container B is as follows:

*_eth0_* _(in A's netns) -> *vethA* -> *br0* -> *vxlan0* ->
network footnoteref:[After this point, device names refer to devices on container B's host.] -> *vxlan0* -> *br0* -> *vethB* -> *eth0* (in B's netns)_

Finally, if container A connects to an external host, the traffic looks like:

*_eth0_* _(in A's netns) -> *vethA* -> *br0* -> *tun0* -> (NAT) -> *eth0* (physical device) -> Internet_

Almost all packet delivery decisions are performed with OpenFlow rules in the
OVS bridge *br0*, which simplifies the plug-in network architecture and provides
flexible routing. In the case of the *ovs-multitenant* plug-in, this also
provides enforceable xref:network-isolation-multitenant[network isolation].
