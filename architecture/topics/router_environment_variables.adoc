== Router Environment Variables

For all the items outlined in this section, you can set environment variables in
the *deployment config* for the router to alter its configuration, or use the
`oc set env` command:

----
$ oc set env <object_type>/<object_name> KEY1=VALUE1 KEY2=VALUE2
----

For example:

----
$ oc set env dc/router ROUTER_SYSLOG_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1 ROUTER_LOG_LEVEL=debug
----

|Variable | Default | Description
|`DEFAULT_CERTIFICATE` |  | The contents of a default certificate to use for routes that don't expose a TLS server cert; in PEM format.
|`DEFAULT_CERTIFICATE_DIR` |  | A path to a directory that contains a file named *_tls.crt_*. If *_tls.crt_* is not a PEM file which also contains a private key, it is first combined with a file named tls.key in the same directory. The PEM-format contents are then used as the default certificate. Only used if `DEFAULT_CERTIFICATE` or `DEFAULT_CERTIFICATE_PATH` are not specified.
|`DEFAULT_CERTIFICATE_PATH` |  | A path to default certificate to use for routes that don't expose a TLS server cert; in PEM format. Only used if `DEFAULT_CERTIFICATE` is not specified.
|`DROP_SYN_DURING_RESTART` |  `false` | When set to `true`, enables an iptables rule to drop certain packets during a restart to provide a seamless restart.
ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
See xref:../../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#preventing-connection-failures-during-restarts[the install guide] for details.
endif::[]
|`EXTENDED_VALIDATION` | `true` | If `true`, the router confirms that the certificate is structurally correct. It does not verify the certificate against any CA. Set `false` to turn off the tests.
|`NAMESPACE_LABELS` |  | A label selector to apply to namespaces to watch, empty means all.
|`PROJECT_LABELS` |  | A label selector to apply to projects to watch, emtpy means all.
|`RELOAD_SCRIPT` |  | The path to the reload script to use to reload the router.
|`ROUTER_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` | | A comma-separated list of domains that the host name in a route can only be part of. Any subdomain in the domain can be used. Option `ROUTER_DENIED_DOMAINS` overrides any values given in this option. If set, everything outside of the allowed domains will be rejected.
|`ROUTER_BACKEND_CHECK_INTERVAL` | 5000ms | Length of time between subsequent "liveness" checks on backends. xref:time-units[(TimeUnits)]
|`ROUTER_BACKEND_PROCESS_ENDPOINTS` | | String to specify how the endpoints should be processed while using the template function processEndpointsForAlias. Valid values are ["shuffle", ""]. "shuffle" will randomize the elements upon every call. Default behavior returns in pre-determined order.
|`ROUTER_CLIENT_FIN_TIMEOUT` | 1s | Controls the TCP FIN timeout period for the client connecting to the route. If the FIN sent to close the connection is not answered within the given time, HAProxy will close the connection anyway.  This is harmless if set to a low value and uses fewer resources on the router.  xref:time-units[(TimeUnits)]
|`ROUTER_COOKIE_NAME` |  | Specifies cookie name to override the internally generated default name.  The name must consist of any combination of upper and lower case letters, digits, "_",
and "-". The default is the hashed internal key name for the route.
|`ROUTER_COMPRESSION_MIME` | "text/html text/plain text/css" | A space separated list of mime types to compress.
|`ROUTER_DEFAULT_CLIENT_TIMEOUT`| 30s | Length of time within which a client has to acknowledge or send data. xref:time-units[(TimeUnits)]
|`ROUTER_DEFAULT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`| 5s | The maximum connect time. xref:time-units[(TimeUnits)]
|`ROUTER_DEFAULT_SERVER_FIN_TIMEOUT` | 1s | Controls the TCP FIN timeout from the router to the pod backing the route.  xref:time-units[(TimeUnits)]
|`ROUTER_DEFAULT_SERVER_TIMEOUT`| 30s | Length of time within which a server has to acknowledge or send data. xref:time-units[(TimeUnits)]
|`ROUTER_DEFAULT_TUNNEL_TIMEOUT` | 1h | Length of time till which TCP or WebSocket connections will remain open. If you have websockets/tcp
connections (and any time HAProxy is reloaded), the old HAProxy processes
will "linger" around for that period. xref:time-units[(TimeUnits)]
|`ROUTER_DENIED_DOMAINS` | | A comma-separated list of domains that the host name in a route can not be part of. No subdomain in the domain can be used either. Overrides option `ROUTER_ALLOWED_DOMAINS`.
|`ROUTER_ENABLE_COMPRESSION`| | If `true` or `TRUE`, compress responses when possible.
|`ROUTER_ENABLE_INGRESS`| | If `true` or `TRUE`, look at both Ingress objects and Route objects.
|`ROUTER_LISTEN_ADDR`| 0.0.0.0:1936 | Sets the listening address for xref:../../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#exposing-the-router-metrics[router metrics].
|`ROUTER_LOG_LEVEL` | warning | The log level to send to the syslog server.
|`ROUTER_MAX_CONNECTIONS`| 20000 | Maximum number of concurrent connections.
|`ROUTER_METRICS_TYPE`| haproxy | Generate metrics for xref:../../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#exposing-the-router-metrics[the HAProxy router]. (haproxy is the only supported value)
|`ROUTER_OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME`|  | If set `true`, override the spec.host value for a route with the template in `ROUTER_SUBDOMAIN`.
|`ROUTER_SERVICE_HTTPS_PORT` | 443 | Port to listen for HTTPS requests.
|`ROUTER_SERVICE_HTTP_PORT` | 80 | Port to listen for HTTP requests.
|`ROUTER_SERVICE_NAME` | public | The name that the router identifies itself in the in route status.
|`ROUTER_CANONICAL_HOSTNAME` | | The (optional) host name of the router shown in the in route status.
|`ROUTER_SERVICE_NAMESPACE` |  | The namespace the router identifies itself in the in route status. Required if `ROUTER_SERVICE_NAME` is used.
|`ROUTER_SERVICE_NO_SNI_PORT` | 10443 | Internal port for some front-end to back-end communication (see note below).
|`ROUTER_SERVICE_SNI_PORT` | 10444 | Internal port for some front-end to back-end communication (see note below).
|`ROUTER_SLOWLORIS_HTTP_KEEPALIVE`| 300s | Set the maximum time to wait for a new HTTP request to appear. If this is set too low, it can confuse browsers and applications not expecting a small `keepalive` value. xref:time-units[(TimeUnits)]
|`ROUTER_SLOWLORIS_TIMEOUT` | 10s | Length of time the transmission of an HTTP request can take. xref:time-units[(TimeUnits)]
|`ROUTER_SUBDOMAIN`|  | The template that should be used to generate the host name for a route without spec.host (e.g. ${name}-${namespace}.myapps.mycompany.com).
|`ROUTER_SYSLOG_ADDRESS` |  | Address to send log messages. Disabled if empty.
|`ROUTER_SYSLOG_FORMAT` | | If set, override the default log format used by underlying router implementation. Its value should conform with underlying router implementation's specification.
|`ROUTER_TCP_BALANCE_SCHEME` | source | xref:load-balancing[Load-balancing strategy] for multiple endpoints for pass-through routes. Available options are `source`, `roundrobin`, or `leastconn`.
|`ROUTER_LOAD_BALANCE_ALGORITHM` | leastconn | xref:load-balancing[Load-balancing strategy] for routes with multiple endpoints. Available options are `source`, `roundrobin`, and `leastconn`.
//|`*ROUTE_FIELDS*` |  | A field selector to apply to routes to watch, empty means all. (FUTURE: it does not have complete support we need in upstream/k8s.)
|`ROUTE_LABELS` |  | A label selector to apply to the routes to watch, empty means all.
|`STATS_PASSWORD` |  | The password needed to access router stats (if the router implementation supports it).
|`STATS_PORT` |  | Port to expose statistics on (if the router implementation supports it).  If not set, stats are not exposed.
|`STATS_USERNAME` |  | The user name needed to access router stats (if the router implementation supports it).
|`TEMPLATE_FILE` | `/var/lib/haproxy/conf/custom/` `haproxy-config-custom.template` | The path to the HAProxy template file (in the container image).
|`RELOAD_INTERVAL` | 5s | The minimum frequency the router is allowed to reload to accept new changes. xref:time-units[(TimeUnits)]
|`ROUTER_USE_PROXY_PROTOCOL`|  | When set to `true` or `TRUE`, HAProxy expects incoming connections to use the `PROXY` protocol on port 80 or port 443. The source IP address can pass through a load balancer if the load balancer supports the protocol, for example Amazon ELB.
|`ROUTER_ALLOW_WILDCARD_ROUTES`|  |  When set to `true` or `TRUE`, any routes with a wildcard policy of `Subdomain` that pass the router admission checks will be serviced by the HAProxy router.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to run multiple routers on the same machine, you must change the
ports that the router is listening on, `ROUTER_SERVICE_SNI_PORT` and
`ROUTER_SERVICE_NO_SNI_PORT`. These ports can be anything you want as long as
they are unique on the machine. These ports will not be exposed externally.
