In {product-title}, each route can have any number of
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[labels]
in its `metadata` field.
A router uses _selectors_ (also known as a _selection expression_)
to select a subset of routes from the entire pool of routes to serve.
A selection expression can also involve
labels on the route's namespace.
The selected routes form a _router shard_.

You can
xref:../../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#creating-router-shards[create]
and
xref:../../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#modifying-router-shards[modify]
router shards independently from the routes, themselves.
endif::[]

This design supports _traditional_ sharding as well as _overlapped_ sharding.
In traditional sharding, the selection results in no overlapping sets
and a route belongs to exactly one shard.
In overlapped sharding, the selection results in overlapping sets
and a route can belong to many different shards.
For example, a single route may belong to a `SLA=high` shard
(but not `SLA=medium` or `SLA=low` shards),
as well as a `geo=west` shard
(but not a `geo=east` shard).

Another example of overlapped sharding is a
set of routers that select based on namespace of the route:

[cols="1,1,3",options="header"]
|===
| Router | Selection | Namespaces

|router-1
|`A*` -- `J*`
|`A*`, `B*`, `C*`, `D*`, `E*`, `F*`, `G*`, `H*`, `I*`, `J*`

|router-2
|`K*` -- `T*`
|`K*`, `L*`, `M*`, `N*`, `O*`, `P*`, `Q*`, `R*`, `S*`, `T*`

|router-3
|`Q*` -- `Z*`
|`Q*`, `R*`, `S*`, `T*`, `U*`, `V*`, `W*`, `X*`, `Y*`, `Z*`
|===

Both `router-2` and `router-3` serve routes that are in the
namespaces `Q*`, `R*`, `S*`, `T*`.
To change this example from overlapped to traditional sharding,
we could change the selection of `router-2` to `K*` -- `P*`,
which would eliminate the overlap.

When routers are sharded,
a given route is bound to zero or more routers in the group.
The route binding ensures uniqueness of the route across the shard.
Uniqueness allows secure and non-secure versions of the same route to exist
within a single shard.
This implies that routes now have a visible life cycle
that moves from created to bound to active.

In the sharded environment the first route to hit the shard
reserves the right to exist there indefinitely, even across restarts.

During a green/blue deployment a route may be be selected in multiple routers.
An {product-title} application administrator may wish to bleed traffic from one
version of the application to another and then turn off the old version.

Sharding can be done by the administrator at a cluster level and by the user
at a project/namespace level.
When namespace labels are used, the service account for the router
must have `cluster-reader` permission to permit the
router to access the labels in the namespace.


[NOTE]
====
For two or more routes that claim the same host name, the resolution order
is based on the age of the route and the oldest route would win the claim to
that host.
In the case of sharded routers, routes are selected based on their labels
matching the router's selection criteria. There is no consistent way to
determine when labels are added to a route. So if an older route claiming
an existing host name is "re-labelled" to match the router's selection
criteria, it will replace the existing route based on the above mentioned
resolution order (oldest route wins).
