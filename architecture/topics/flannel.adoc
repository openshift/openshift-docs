*flannel* is a virtual networking layer designed specifically for containers. 
{product-title} can use it for networking containers instead of the default
software-defined networking (SDN) components. This is useful if running
{product-title} within a cloud provider platform that also relies on SDN,
such as OpenStack, and you want to avoid encapsulating packets twice through
both platforms.

*Architecture*

{product-title} runs *flannel* in *host-gw* mode, which maps routes from
container to container. Each host within the network runs an agent called
*flanneld*, which is responsible for:

- Managing a unique subnet on each host
- Distributing IP addresses to each container on its host
- Mapping routes from one container to another, even if on different hosts

Each *flanneld* agent provides this information to a centralized *etcd* store so
other agents on hosts can route packets to other containers within the
*flannel* network.

The following diagram illustrates the architecture and data flow from one
container to another using a *flannel* network:
