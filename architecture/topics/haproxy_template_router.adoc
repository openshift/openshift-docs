= The HAProxy Template Router

The HAProxy template router implementation is the reference implementation for a
template router plug-in. It uses the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
*openshift3/ose-haproxy-router*
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*openshift/origin-haproxy-router*
endif::[]
repository to run an HAProxy instance alongside the template router plug-in.

The template router has two components:

* A wrapper that watches endpoints and routes and causes a HAProxy reload based on changes
* A controller that builds the HAProxy configuration file based on routes and endpoints

[NOTE]
====
The link:https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.8/configuration.html[HAProxy router] uses version 1.8.1.
====

The controller and HAProxy are housed inside a pod, which is managed by a deployment configuration. The process of setting up the router is automated
by the `oc adm router` command.

The controller watches the routes and endpoints for changes, as well as
HAProxy's health. When a change is detected, it builds a new haproxy-config file
and restarts HAProxy. The haproxy-config file is constructed based on the
router's template file and information from {product-title}.

The HAProxy template file can be customized as
needed to support features that are not currently supported by {product-title}.
The link:https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.5/configuration.html[HAProxy
manual] describes all of the features supported by HAProxy.

The following diagram illustrates how data flows from the master through the
plug-in and finally into an HAProxy configuration:

[[haproxy-metrics]]
*HAProxy Template Router Metrics*

The HAProxy router exposes or publishes metrics in
link:https://Prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/[Prometheus format]
for consumption by external metrics collection and aggregation systems (e.g. Prometheus, statsd).
The router can be
xref:../../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#exposing-the-router-metrics[configured]
to provide
link:https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.5/configuration.html#9[HAProxy CSV format] metrics, or
provide no router metrics at all.

The metrics are collected from both the router controller and from HAProxy every
five seconds. The router metrics counters start at zero when the router is deployed
and increase over time. The HAProxy metrics counters are reset to zero every
time haproxy is reloaded. The router collects HAProxy statistics for each
frontend, back end, and server. To reduce resource usage when there are more than
500 servers, the back ends are reported instead of the servers because a back end
can have multiple servers.

The statistics are a subset of 
link:https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.5/configuration.html#9.1[the available HAProxy statistics].

The following HAProxy metrics are collected on a periodic basis and converted to
Prometheus format. For every front end the "F" counters are collected. When the
counters are collected for each back end and the "S" server counters are
collected for each server. Otherwise, the "B" counters are collected for each
back end and no server counters are collected.

In the following table:
