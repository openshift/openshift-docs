== Overview
OpenShift utilizes any server implementing the Docker registry API as a source of images, including the canonical Docker Hub, private registries run by third parties, and the integrated OpenShift registry.

== Integrated OpenShift Registry
OpenShift provides an integrated Docker registry that adds the ability to provision new image repositories on the fly (this feature is still a work in progress). This allows users to automatically have a place for their builds to push the resulting images.

Whenever a new image is pushed to the integrated registry, the registry notifies OpenShift about the new image, passing along all the information about it, such as the namespace, name, and image metadata. Different pieces of OpenShift react to new images, creating new link:builds.html[builds] and link:../using_openshift/deployments.html[deployments].

== Third Party Registries
OpenShift can create containers using images from third party registries, but it is unlikely that these registries offer the same image notification support as the integrated OpenShift registry. If not, OpenShift can poll the other registries for changes to image repositories. When new images are detected, the same build and deployment reactions described above occur.

NOTE: Polling is not implemented yet.

=== Authentication
OpenShift can communicate with registries to access private image repositories using credentials supplied by the user. This allows OpenShift to push and pull images to and from private repositories.

See the link:authentication.html[Authentication] topic for more information.
