== Overview

The OpenShift Ansible broker (OAB) is an implementation of the Open Service
Broker (OSB) API that manages applications defined by
xref:service-catalog-apb[_Ansible playbook bundles (APBs)_]. APBs provide a new
method for defining and distributing container applications in {product-title},
consisting of a bundle of Ansible playbooks built into a container image with an
Ansible runtime. APBs leverage Ansible to create a standard mechanism for
automating complex deployments.

The design of the OAB follows this basic workflow:

. A user requests list of available applications from the service catalog using
the {product-title} web console.
. The service catalog requests the OAB for available applications.
. The OAB communicates with a defined container registry to learn which APBs are
available.
. The user issues a request to provision a specific APB.
. The provision request makes its way to the OAB, which fulfills the user's
request by invoking the provision method on the APB.

== Ansible Playbook Bundles

An Ansible playbook bundle (APB) is a lightweight application definition that
allows you to leverage existing investment in Ansible roles and playbooks.

APBs use a simple directory with named playbooks to perform OSB API actions,
such as provision and bind. Metadata defined in *_apb.yml_* spec file contains a
list of required and optional parameters for use during deployment.

See the xref:../../apb_devel/index.adoc#apb-devel-design[APB Development Guide]
for details on the overall design and how APBs are written.
