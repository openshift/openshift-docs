== Overview

[NOTE]
====
Enabling the Ansible service broker is a Technology Preview feature only.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not
supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs), might not be
functionally complete, and Red Hat does not recommend to use them for
production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features,
enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the
development process.

For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features support scope, see
https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.

The Ansible service broker (ASB) is an implementation of the OSB API that
manages applications defined by xref:service-catalog-apb[_Ansible playbook
bundles (APBs)_]. APBs provide a new method for defining and distributing
container applications in {product-title}, consisting of a bundle of Ansible
playbooks built into a container image with an Ansible runtime. APBs leverage
Ansible to create a standard mechanism for automating complex deployments.

The design of the ASB follows this basic workflow:

. A user requests list of available applications from the service catalog using
the {product-title} web console.
. The service catalog requests the ASB for available applications.
. The ASB communicates with a defined container registry to learn which APBs are
available.
. The user issues a request to provision a specific APB.
. The provision request makes its way to the ASB, which fulfills the user's
request by invoking the provision method on the APB.

== Ansible Playbook Bundles

An Ansible playbook bundle (APB) is a lightweight application definition that
allows you to leverage existing investment in Ansible roles and playbooks.

APBs use a simple directory with named playbooks to perform OSB API actions,
such as provision and bind. Metadata defined in *_apb.yml_* spec file contains a
list of required and optional parameters for use during deployment.

[[service-catalog-apb-directory]]
=== Directory Structure

The following shows an example directory structure of an APB:

----
example-apb/
├── Dockerfile
├── apb.yml
└── roles/
│   └── example-apb-openshift
│       ├── defaults
│       │   └── main.yml
│       └── tasks
│           └── main.yml
└── playbooks/
    └── provision.yml
    └── deprovision.yml
    └── bind.yml
    └── unbind.yml
----

[[service-catalog-spec-file]]
=== Spec File

An APB spec file (*_apb.yml_*) must be edited for your specific application. For
example, the `etherpad-apb` spec file looks as follows:

----
name: fusor/etherpad-apb
description: Note taking web application
bindable: true
async: optional
parameters:
  - name: hostport
    description: The host TCP port as the external endpoint
    type: int
    default: 9001
  - name: db_user
    description: Database User
    type: string
----

For an APB that does not have any parameters, the `parameters` field should be
blank:

----
parameters: []
----

[[service-catalog-actions]]
=== Actions

The following are the actions for an APB. At a minimum, an APB must implement
the provision and deprovision actions.

*_provision.yml_*::
Playbook called to handle installing application to the cluster.

*_deprovision.yml_*::
Playbook called to handle uninstalling.

*_bind.yml_*::
Playbook to grant access to another service to use this service. For example,
generating credentials.

*_unbind.yml_*::
Playbook to revoke access to this service.

*_whitelist.yaml_*::
Playbook filtering out APBs by image name. Allows the matches to the listed
regular expressions and blocks any APB that does not match. See
link:https://github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker/blob/master/docs/filtering_apbs.md#apb-filtering[APB
Filtering] for more information.

*_blacklist.yaml_*::
Playbook filtering out APBs by image name. Allows all APBs that do not match the
listed regular expressions and blocks all APBs that match a regular expression
in the list. See
link:https://github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker/blob/master/docs/filtering_apbs.md#apb-filtering[APB
Filtering] for more information.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When both *_whitelist.yaml_* and *_blacklist.yaml_* are present, matches in the
listed regular expressions in the whitelist are allowed, but not those in the
blacklist. APBs that match a listed regular expression in the blacklist are
blocked.
====

The required named playbooks correspond to methods defined by the OSB API. For
example, when the ASB needs to provision an APB, it will execute the
*_provision.yml_*.

After the required named playbooks have been generated, the files can be used
directly to test management of the application. A developer may want to work
with this directory of files, make changes, run, and repeat until they are
satisfied with the behavior. They can test the playbooks by invoking Ansible
directly with the playbook and any required variables.
