The _template service broker_ (TSB) gives the service catalog visibility into
the xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#using-the-instantapp-templates[default Instant App and Quickstart templates] that have shipped with {product-title}
since its initial release. The TSB can also make available as a service anything
for which an {product-title}
xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[template] has been
written, whether provided by Red Hat, a cluster administrator or user, or a
third party vendor.

By default, the TSB shows the objects that are globally available from the
*openshift* project. It can also be configured to watch any other project that a
cluster administrator chooses.
