AWS Service Broker:: 
The link:https://aws.amazon.com/partners/servicebroker/[_AWS Service Broker_] is an implementation of the link:https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/[Open Service Broker API] to publish services to external environments, such as Kubernetes and the {product-title} service catalog.

AWS Identity Access Management::
