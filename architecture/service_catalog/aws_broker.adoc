[NOTE]
====
The AWS Service Broker is supported and qualified on {product-title}. It is offered directly from Amazon as a download and as such, many components of this service broker solution are supported directly by Amazon for the most recent two versions with a lag of two months after a new {product-title} release.
Red Hat provides support for the installation and troubleshooting of the OpenShift cluster and service catalog issues.
