When developing microservices-based applications to run on cloud native
platforms, there are many ways to provision different resources and share their
coordinates, credentials, and configuration, depending on the service
provider and the platform.

To give developers a more seamless experience, {product-title} includes a
_service catalog_, an implementation of the
link:https://openservicebrokerapi.org/[Open Service Broker API] (OSB API) for
Kubernetes. This allows users to connect any of their applications deployed in
{product-title} to a wide variety of service brokers.

The service catalog allows cluster administrators to integrate multiple
platforms using a single API specification. The {product-title} web console
displays the service classes offered by brokers in the service catalog, allowing
users to discover and instantiate those services for use with their
applications.

As a result, service users benefit from ease and consistency of use across
different types of services from different providers, while service providers
benefit from having one integration point that gives them access to multiple
platforms.

[[service-catalog-design]]
== Design

The design of the service catalog follows this basic workflow:

[NOTE]
====
New terms in the following are defined further in xref:service-catalog-concepts-terminology[Concepts and Terminology].
====

image::svc-catalog-arch.png["Service Catalog Architecture"]
<1> A cluster administrator registers one or more _service brokers_ with their {product-title}
cluster. This can be done automatically during installation for some
default-provided service brokers or manually.
<2> Each service broker specifies a set of _service classes_ and variations of those
services (_service plans_) to {product-title} that should be made available to
users.
<3> Using the {product-title} web console or CLI, users discover the services that
are available. For example, a service class may be available that is a
database-as-a-service called BestDataBase.
<4> A user chooses a service class and requests a new _instance_ of their own. For
example, a service instance may be a BestDataBase instance named `my_db`.
<5> A user links, or _binds_, their service instance to a set of pods (their
application). For example, the `my_db` service instance may be bound to the
user's application called `my_app`.

This infrastructure allows a loose coupling between applications running in
{product-title} and the services they use. This allows the application that uses
those services to focus on its own business logic while leaving the management
of these services to the provider.

[[service-catalog-concepts-terminology]]
== Concepts and Terminology

Service Broker::
A _service broker_ is a server that conforms to the OSB API specification and
manages a set of one or more services. The software could be hosted within your
own {product-title} cluster or elsewhere.
+
Cluster administrators can create `Broker` API resources representing service
brokers and register them with their {product-title} cluster. This allows
cluster administrators to make new types of managed services using that service
broker available within their cluster.
+
A `Broker` resource specifies connection details for a service broker and the
set of services (and variations of those services) to {product-title} that
should then be made available to users.
+
.Example `Broker` Resource
----
apiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Broker
metadata:
  name: BestCompanySaaS
spec:
  url: http://bestdatabase.example.com
----

Service Class::
Also synonymous with "service" in the context of the service catalog, a _service
class_ is a type of managed service offered by a particular broker. Each time a
new broker resource is added to the cluster, the service catalog controller
connects to the corresponding service broker to obtain a list of service
offerings. A new `ServiceClass` resource is automatically created for each.
+
[NOTE]
====
{product-title} also has a core concept called
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[services],
which are separate Kubernetes resources related to internal load balancing.
These resources are not to be confused with how the term is used in the context
of the service catalog and OSB API.
====
+
.Example `ServiceClass` Resource
----
apiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceClass
metadata:
  name: smallDB
  brokerName: BestDataBase
  plans: [...]
----

Service Plan::
A _service plan_ is represents tiers of a service class. For example, a service
class may expose a set of plans that offer varying degrees of quality-of-service
(QoS), each with a different cost associated with it.

Service Instance::
A _service instance_ is a provisioned instance of a service class. When a user
wants to use the capability provided by a service class, they can create a new
instance.
+
When a new `Instance` resource is created, the service catalog controller
connects to the appropriate service broker and instructs it to provision the
service instance.
+
.Example `Instance` Resource
----
apiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Instance
metadata:
  name: my_db
spec:
  serviceClassName: smallDB
----

Application::
The term _application_ refers to the {product-title} deployment artifacts, for
example pods running in a user's project, that will use a _service instance_.

Credentials::
_Credentials_ are information needed by an application to communicate with a
service instance.

Service Binding::
A _service binding_ is a link between a service instance and an application.
These are created by cluster users who wish for their applications to reference
and use a service instance.
+
Upon creation, the service catalog controller creates a Kubernetes secret
containing connection details and credentials for the service instance. Such
secrets can be mounted into pods as usual. There is also integration with
`PodPresets`, which allow you to express how the secret should be consumed, and
in which pods.
+
.Example `Binding` Resource
----
apiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Binding
metadata:
  name: myBinding
spec:
  secretName: mySecret
  <pod_selector_labels>

== Provided Service Brokers

{product-title} provides the following service brokers for use with the service
catalog.

[NOTE]
====
Because the service catalog is currently Technology Preview, the provided
service brokers are also currently Technology Preview.
