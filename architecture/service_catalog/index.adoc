[[service-catalog-overview]]
== Overview

When developing microservices-based applications to run on cloud native
platforms, there are many ways to provision different resources and share their
coordinates, credentials, and configuration, depending on the service
provider and the platform.

To give developers a more seamless experience, {product-title} includes a
_service catalog_, an implementation of the
link:https://openservicebrokerapi.org/[Open Service Broker API] (OSB API) for
Kubernetes. This allows users to connect any of their applications deployed in
{product-title} to a wide variety of service brokers.

The service catalog allows cluster administrators to integrate multiple
platforms using a single API specification. The {product-title} web console
displays the cluster service classes offered by service brokers in the service
catalog, allowing users to discover and instantiate those services for use with
their applications.

As a result, service users benefit from ease and consistency of use across
different types of services from different providers, while service providers
benefit from having one integration point that gives them access to multiple
platforms.

[[service-catalog-design]]
== Design

The design of the service catalog follows this basic workflow:

[NOTE]
====
New terms in the following are defined further in xref:service-catalog-concepts-terminology[Concepts and Terminology].
====

image::svc-catalog-arch.png["Service Catalog Architecture"]
<1> A cluster administrator registers one or more _cluster service brokers_ with
their {product-title} cluster. This can be done automatically during installation
for some default-provided service brokers or manually.
<2> Each service broker specifies a set of _cluster service classes_ and
variations of those services (_service plans_) to {product-title} that should be
made available to users.
<3> Using the {product-title} web console or CLI, users discover the services that
are available. For example, a cluster service class may be available that is a
database-as-a-service called BestDataBase.
<4> A user chooses a cluster service class and requests a new _instance_ of
their own. For example, a service instance may be a BestDataBase instance named
`my_db`.
<5> A user links, or _binds_, their service instance to a set of pods (their
application). For example, the `my_db` service instance may be bound to the
user's application called `my_app`.

This infrastructure allows a loose coupling between applications running in
{product-title} and the services they use. This allows the application that uses
those services to focus on its own business logic while leaving the management
of these services to the provider.

[[service-catalog-deleting-resources]]
=== Deleting Resources

When a user is done with a service (or perhaps no longer wishes to be billed),
the service instance can be deleted. In order to delete the service instance,
the service bindings must be removed first. Deleting the service bindings is
known as _unbinding_. Part of the deletion process includes deleting the secret
that references the service binding being deleted.

Once all the service bindings are removed, the service instance may be deleted.
Deleting the service instance is known as _deprovisioning_. 

[[service-catalog-concepts-terminology]]
== Concepts and Terminology

Cluster Service Broker::
A _cluster service broker_ is a server that conforms to the OSB API specification
and manages a set of one or more services. The software could be hosted within|
your own {product-title} cluster or elsewhere.
+
Cluster administrators can create `ClusterServiceBroker` API resources
representing cluster service brokers and register them with their {product-title}
cluster. This allows cluster administrators to make new types of managed services
using that cluster service broker available within their cluster.
+
A `ClusterServiceBroker` resource specifies connection details for a cluster
service broker and the set of services (and variations of those services) to
{product-title} that should then be made available to users. Of special note is
the `authInfo` section, which contains the data used to authenticate with the
cluster service broker.
+
.Example `ClusterServiceBroker` Resource
----
apiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterServiceBroker
metadata:
  name: BestCompanySaaS
spec:
  url: http://bestdatabase.example.com
  authInfo:
    basic:
      secretRef:
        namespace: test-ns
        name: secret-name
----

Cluster Service Class::
Also synonymous with "service" in the context of the service catalog, a _cluster
service class_ is a type of managed service offered by a particular cluster
service broker. Each time a new cluser service broker resource is added to the
cluster, the service catalog controller connects to the corresponding cluster
service broker to obtain a list of service offerings. A new `ClusterServiceClass`
resource is automatically created for each.
+
[NOTE]
====
{product-title} also has a core concept called
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[services],
which are separate Kubernetes resources related to internal load balancing.
These resources are not to be confused with how the term is used in the context
of the service catalog and OSB API.
====
+
.Example `ClusterServiceClass` Resource
----
apiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterServiceClass
metadata:
  name: smallDB
  brokerName: BestDataBase
  plans: [...]
----

Service Plan::
A _service plan_ is represents tiers of a cluster service class. For example, a
cluster service class may expose a set of plans that offer varying degrees of
quality-of-service (QoS), each with a different cost associated with it.

Service Instance::
A _service instance_ is a provisioned instance of a cluster service class. When a
user wants to use the capability provided by a service class, they can create a
new service instance.
+
When a new `ServiceInstance` resource is created, the service catalog controller
connects to the appropriate cluster service broker and instructs it to provision
the service instance.
+
.Example `ServiceInstance` Resource
----
apiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceInstance
metadata:
  name: my_db
  namespace: test-ns
spec:
  externalClusterServiceClassName: smallDB
  externalClusterServicePlanName: default
----

Application::
The term _application_ refers to the {product-title} deployment artifacts, for
example pods running in a user's project, that will use a _service instance_.

Credentials::
_Credentials_ are information needed by an application to communicate with a
service instance.

Service Binding::
A _service binding_ is a link between a service instance and an application.
These are created by cluster users who wish for their applications to reference
and use a service instance.
+
Upon creation, the service catalog controller creates a Kubernetes secret
containing connection details and credentials for the service instance. Such
secrets can be mounted into pods as usual. There is also integration with
`PodPresets`, which allow you to express how the secret should be consumed, and
in which pods.
+
.Example `ServiceBinding` Resource
----
apiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: myBinding
  namespace: test-ns
spec:
  instanceRef:
    name: my_db
  parameters:
    securityLevel: confidential
  secretName: mySecret
----

Parameters::
A _parameter_ is a special field available to pass additional data to the cluster
service broker when using either service bindings or service instances. The only
formatting requirement is for the parameters to be valid YAML (or JSON). In the
above example, a security level parameter is passed to the cluster service broker
in the service binding request. For parameters that need more security, place
them in a secret and reference them using `parametersFrom`.
+
.Example Service Binding Resource Referencing a Secret

apiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1beta1

metadata:
  name: myBinding
  namespace: test-ns
spec:

    name: my_db

    - secretKeyRef:
        name: securityLevel
