== Overview
Routers provide external DNS mapping and load balancing to services over protocols that pass distinguishing information directly to the router (HTTP, HTTPS, and TLS with SNI). Routers subscribe to configuration changes and automatically update themselves with new configuration, and routers may be containerized or virtual (converting those changes to API calls to a system like an F5).

Other automatic capabilities exist to load balance individual services within the cluster exposed via configuration on link relations between services and would ensure a set of services would be available. Implementations may choose to implement these as local proxies per host, or to reuse the shared routing infrastructure.
