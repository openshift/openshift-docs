== Overview

OpenShift takes advantage of a feature built into Kubernetes to support
executing commands in containers. This is implemented using HTTP along with a
multiplexed streaming protocol such as link:http://www.chromium.org/spdy[SPDY]
or link:https://http2.github.io/[HTTP/2].

=== Client operation

==== CLI

Support for remote container command execution is built into `kubectl`:

----
kubectl exec -p <pod> [-c <container>] -- <command> [<arg 1> ... <arg n>]
----

==== Protocol

Clients initiate the execution of a remote command in a container by issuing a
request to the Kubernetes API Server:

----
/proxy/minions/node123.openshift.com/exec/myns/mypod/mycontainer?command=date
----

In the above URL:

* `node123.openshift.com` is the node name
* `myns` is the target pod's namespace
* `mypod` is the target pod's name
* `mycontainer` is the target container's name
* `command=date` is the desired command to be executed

Additionally, the client can add parameters to the request to indicate if:

* the client should send input to the remote container's command (stdin)
* the client's terminal is a TTY
* the remote container's command should send output from stdout to the client
* the remote container's command should send output from stderr to the client

After sending an exec request to the API Server, the client upgrades the
connection to one that supports multiplexed streams; the current implementation
uses SPDY.

The client creates one stream each for stdin, stdout, and stderr. To
distinguish among the streams, the client sets the `streamType` header on the
stream to one of `stdin`, `stdout`, or `stderr`.

The client should close all streams, the upgraded connection, and the
underlying connection when it is finished with the remote command execution
request.

=== Server operation

The Kubelet is responsible for handling remote execution requests from clients.
Upon receiving a request, it upgrades the response, evaluates the request
headers to determine what streams (stdin, stdout, stderr)) to expect to
receive, and waits for the client to create the streams. Once the Kubelet has
received all the streams, it executes the command in the container, copying
between the streams and the command's stdin, stdout, and stderr, as
appropriate. When the command terminates, the Kubelet closes the upgraded
connection, as well as the underlying one.

==== Executing a command in a container

There are a few different options for running a command in a container. The
current implementation invokes `nsenter` directly on the host (node) to enter
the container's namespaces prior to executing the command. Other options
include using `docker exec` and running a "helper" container that then runs
`nsenter` (so `nsenter` isn't a required binary that must be installed on the
host).
