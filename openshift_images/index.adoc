== How you can use the Cluster Samplers Operator hello

During the initial start-up, the operator creates the default samples resource to initiate the creation of the image streams and templates.
You can use the Cluster Samples Operator to manage the sample image streams and templates stored in the `openshift` namespace.

As a cluster administrator, you can use the Cluster Samplers Operator to:

** xref:../openshift_images/configuring-samples-operator.adoc#configuring-samples-operator[Configure the operator].
** xref:../openshift_images/samples-operator-alt-registry.adoc#samples-operator-alt-registry[Use the operator with an alternate registry].

== Images

A container image is the binary data that encapsulates an application and all its software dependencies.
A container image is an executable software bundle that runs standalone.
You can xref:../openshift_images/create-images.adoc#creating-images[create], xref:../openshift_images/managing_images/managing-images-overview.adoc#managing-images-overview[manage], and xref:../openshift_images/using_images/using-images-overview.adoc#using-images-overview[use] container images.

== Images streams

An image stream is a single pointer to a set of related images.
A single image stream can contain many different tags, such as `latest`, `develop`, and more.
Each tag points to an image in a registry.

You can xref:../openshift_images/image-streams-manage.adoc#managing-image-streams[manage] image streams, xref:../openshift_images/using-imagestreams-with-kube-resources.adoc#using-imagestreams-with-kube-resources[use image streams with Kubernetes resources], and xref:../openshift_images/triggering-updates-on-imagestream-changes.adoc#triggering-updates-on-imagestream-changes[trigger updates on image stream updates].

== Templates

A template is a definition of an object to be replicated.
You can use xref:../openshift_images/using-templates.adoc#using-templates[templates] to build and deploy configurations.
