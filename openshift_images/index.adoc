== Understanding containers, images, and image streams
Containers, images, and image streams are important concepts to understand when you set out to create and manage containerized software.
An image holds a set of software that is ready to run, while a container is a running instance of a container image.
An image stream provides a way of storing different versions of the same basic image.
Those different versions are represented by different tags on the same image name.

== How you can use the Cluster Samples Operator

During the initial startup, the Operator creates the default samples resource to initiate the creation of the image streams and templates.
You can use the Cluster Samples Operator to manage the sample image streams and templates stored in the `openshift` namespace.

As a cluster administrator, you can use the Cluster Samples Operator to:
