= Building and deploying a DPDK payload using the s2i image

The DPDK base image is a base image for DPDK applications. It uses the Source-to-Image (S2I) build tool to automate the
building of application images.

Source-to-Image (S2I) is a tool for building reproducible, Docker-formatted container images.
It produces ready-to-run images by injecting application source into a container image and assembling a new image.
The new image incorporates the base image (the builder) and built source.
For more information, see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/builds/build-strategies.html#build-strategy-s2i_build-strategies[Source-to-Image (S2I) build].

The DPDK base image that comes preinstalled with DPDK, and a build tool used to create a target image with DPDK and
a user provided application.

.Prerequisites

Before using the S2I tool, make sure you have the following components installed and configured:

* OCP Image Registry Operator (See  https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/registry/configuring-registry-operator.html[Image Registry Operator in OpenShift Container Platform].)

* SR-IOV and performance operator (See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.2/html-single/networking/index#configuring-sr-iov[About SR-IOV hardware on OpenShift Container Platform].

An example DPDK-based application base on the dpdk-based image is available in the following repository:
https://github.com/openshift-kni/cnf-features-deploy/tree/master/tools/s2i-dpdk/test/test-app[cnf-features-deploy/tools/s2i-dpdk/test/test-app/].

This example application is the `test-pmd` application provided by dpdk.org:  https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/testpmd_app_ug/[Testpmd Application User Guide].

To build a target image, create a repository containing an application and the following two scripts:

* `build.sh` - for building the application
* `run.sh` - for running the application

This is an example of `build.sh`:

----
#!/usr/bin/env bash

make -C test-pmd

cp test-pmd/testpmd ./customtestpmd

echo "build done"
----

This is an example of `run.sh`:

----
#!/bin/bash -eux

export CPU=$(cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/cpuset.cpus)
echo ${CPU}
echo ${PCIDEVICE_OPENSHIFT_IO_DPDKNIC}

if [ "$RUN_TYPE" == "testpmd" ]; then
envsubst < test-template.sh > test.sh
chmod +x test.sh
expect -f test.sh
fi

while true; do sleep inf; done;
----

The DPDK base image and the application repository are both used to build a target application image.
S2I copies the application from the repository to the DPDK base image, which then builds a target image using
DPDK base image resources and the copied application.

You can use OpenShift BuildConfig to build a target image in a production environment.
A sample manifest file for building the sample DPDK application described above is available here:
https://github.com/openshift-kni/cnf-features-deploy/blob/master/feature-configs/demo/dpdk/build-config.yaml[build-config.yaml].

The `build-config.yaml` file is the file you use to create your automated build. It creates a new `dpdk` namespace and configures an `ImageStream` for the image and starts a build.

<1> The `kind` type specifies the defined image stream.

<2> The `output` type publishes the result of the image stream object.

<3> The `source` type contains the git repository and a context directory within the repository.

<4> The `strategy` type contains a DPDK base image.

It is the `source` type and `strategy` type that build the image.

A complete guide to using BuildConfigs is available at: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/builds/understanding-buildconfigs.html[Understanding build configurations]


After the base DPDK image build is ready, you should create a new directory with a `kustomization.yaml`
file and a `build-config.yaml` patch.

This is an example of `kustomization.yaml`:

----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

bases:
  - ../demo/dpdk
patchesStrategicMerge:
  - build-config.yaml
