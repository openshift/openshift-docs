[role="_abstract"]
To authenticate with container registries and pull images across {product-title} projects or from secured registries, you can configure and use image pull secrets. 

You first obtain the registry authentication credentials, which are typically found in the `~/.docker/config.json` file for Docker or the `~/.config/containers/auth.json` file for Podman, created by the {cluster-manager-url-pull} process. This content is then used to create or update the global `pullSecret` object within your cluster, allowing access to images from link:https://quay.io/[quay.io] and link:https://registry.redhat.io[registry.redhat.io].

[NOTE]
====
If you are using the {product-registry} and are pulling from image streams located in the same project, then your pod service account should already have the correct permissions. No additional action should be required.
