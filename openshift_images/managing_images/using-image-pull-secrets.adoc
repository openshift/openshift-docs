If you are using {product-title}'s internal registry and are pulling from
image streams located in the same project, then your pod's service account should
already have the correct permissions and no additional action should be
required.

However, for other scenarios, such as referencing images across {product-title}
projects or from secured registries, then additional configuration steps are
required.

You can obtain the image pull secret, `pullSecret`, from the link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Pull Secret] page on the {cloud-redhat-com} site.

You use this pull secret to authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities, including link:quay.io[Quay.io] and link:registry.redhat.io[registry.redhat.io], which serve the container images for {product-title} components.
