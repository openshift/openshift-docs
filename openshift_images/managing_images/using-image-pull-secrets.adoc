If you are using {product-title}'s internal registry and are pulling from
imagestreams located in the same project, then your Pod's service account should
already have the correct permissions and no additional action should be
required.

However, for other scenarios, such as referencing images across {product-title}
projects or from secured registries, then additional configuration steps are
required.
