{product-title} provides Base, Maven, and Node.js images for use as Jenkins agents.

The Base image for Jenkins agents does the following:

* Pulls in both the required tools, headless Java, the Jenkins JNLP client, and the useful ones, including `git`, `tar`, `zip`, and `nss`, among others.
* Establishes the JNLP agent as the entry point.
* Includes the `oc` client tooling for invoking command line operations from within Jenkins jobs.
* Provides Dockerfiles for both Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and `localdev` images.

The Maven v3.5, Node.js v10, and Node.js v12 images extend the Base image. They provide Dockerfiles for the Universal Base Image (UBI) that you can reference when building new agent images. Also note the `contrib` and `contrib/bin` subdirectories, which enable you to insert configuration files and executable scripts for your image.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use a version of the agent image that is appropriate for your {product-title} release version. Embedding an `oc` client version that is not compatible with the {product-title} version can cause unexpected behavior.
====

The {product-title} Jenkins image also defines the following sample Pod templates to illustrate how you can use these agent images with the Jenkins Kubernetes plug-in:

- The `maven` pod template, which uses a single container that uses the {product-title} Maven Jenkins agent image.
- The `nodejs` pod template, which uses a single container that uses the {product-title} Node.js Jenkins agent image.
- The `java-builder` pod template, which employs two containers. One is the `jnlp` container, which uses the {product-title} Base agent image and handles the JNLP contract for starting and stopping Jenkins agents. The second is the `java` container which uses the `java` {product-title} Sample ImageStream, which contains the various Java binaries, including the Maven binary `mvn`, for building code.
- The `nodejs-builder` pod template, which employs two containers. One is the `jnlp` container, which uses the {product-title} Base agent image and handles the JNLP contract for starting and stopping Jenkins agents. The second is the `nodejs` container which uses the `nodejs` {product-title} Sample ImageStream, which contains the various Node.js binaries, including the `npm` binary, for building code.
