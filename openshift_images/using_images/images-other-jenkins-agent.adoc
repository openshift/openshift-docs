{product-title} provides three images that are suitable for use as Jenkins agents: the `Base`, `Maven`, and `Node.js` images.

The first is a base image for Jenkins agents:

* It pulls in both the required tools, headless Java, the Jenkins JNLP client, and the useful ones including `git`, `tar`, `zip`, and `nss` among others.
* It establishes the JNLP agent as the entrypoint.
* It includes the `oc` client tooling for invoking command line operations from within Jenkins jobs.
* It provides Dockerfiles for both Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and `localdev` images.

Two more images that extend the base image are also provided:

* Maven v3.5 image
* Node.js v10 image and Node.js v12 image

The Maven and Node.js Jenkins agent images provide Dockerfiles for the Universal Base Image (UBI) that you can reference when building new agent images. Also note the `contrib` and `contrib/bin` subdirectories. They allow for the insertion of configuration files and executable scripts for your image.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use and extend an appropriate agent image version for the your of {product-title}. If the `oc` client version that is embedded in the agent image is not compatible with the {product-title} version, unexpected behavior can result.
====

{product-title} also provides sample pod templates defined in the {product-title} Jenkins image that illustrates how to use these agent images with the Jenkins Kubernetes plug-in.

The four pod templates defined are:
- The `maven` pod template, which uses a single container that uses the {product-title} Maven Jenkins agent image.
- The 'nodejs' pod template which uses a single container that uses the {product-title} Node.js Jenkins agent image.
- The 'java-builder' pod template which employs 2 containers.  One is the 'jnlp' container which uses the {product-title}
Base agent image and handles the JNLP contract for starting and stopping Jenkins agents. The second is the 'java' container
which uses the 'java' {product-title} Sample ImageStream, which contains the various Java binaries, including the Maven binary
'mvn', for building code.
- The 'nodejs-builder' pod template which employs 2 container.  One is the 'jnlp' container which uses the {product-title}
Base agent image and handles the JNLP contract for starting and stopping Jenkins agents. The second is the 'nodejs' container
which uses the 'nodejs' {product-title} Sample ImageStream, which contains the various Node.js binaries, including the 'npm' binary,
for building code.
