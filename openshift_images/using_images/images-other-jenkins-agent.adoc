{product-title} provides three images that are suitable for use as Jenkins agents:
the *_Base_*, *_Maven_*, and *_Node.js_* images.

The first is a base image for Jenkins agents:

* It pulls in both the required tools, headless Java, the Jenkins JNLP client,
   and the useful ones including `git`, `tar`, `zip`, and `nss` among others.
* It establishes the JNLP agent as the entrypoint.
* It includes the `oc` client tooling for invoking command line operations from
   within Jenkins jobs.
* It provides Dockerfiles for both Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and `localdev` images.

Two more images that extend the base image are also provided:

* Maven v3.5 image
* Node.js v10 image and Node.js v12 image

The Maven and Node.js Jenkins agent images provide Dockerfiles for the Universal
Base Image (UBI) that you can reference when building new agent images. Also
note the `contrib` and `contrib/bin` subdirectories. They allow for the
insertion of configuration files and executable scripts for your image.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use and extend an appropriate agent image version for the your
of {product-title}. If the `oc` client version that is embedded in
the agent image is not compatible with the {product-title} version, unexpected
behavior can result.
