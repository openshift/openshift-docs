You can use the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_software_collections/3/html-single/using_red_hat_software_collections_container_images/index[Red Hat Software Collections] images as a foundation for applications that rely on specific runtime environments such as Node.js, Perl, or Python. You can use the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openjdk/11/html/using_openjdk_11_source-to-image_for_openshift/index[Red Hat Java Source-to-Image for OpenShift] documentation as a reference for runtime environments that use Java. Special versions of some of these runtime base images are referred to as Source-to-Image (S2I) images. With S2I images, you can insert your code into a base image environment that is ready to run that code.

S2I images include:

* .NET
* Java
* Go
* Node.js
* Perl
* PHP
* Python
* Ruby

S2I images are available for you to use directly from the {product-title} web console by following procedure:

. Log in to the {product-title} web console using your login credentials. The default view for the {product-title} web console is the *Administrator* perspective.
. Use the perspective switcher to switch to the *Developer* perspective.
. In the *+Add* view, use the *Project* drop-down list to select an existing project or create a new project.
. Click *All services* in the *Developer Catalog* tile.
. Click *Builder Images* under *Type* to see the available S2I images.

S2I images are also available though the xref:../../openshift_images/configuring-samples-operator.adoc#configuring-samples-operator[Cluster Samples Operator].
