{product-title} provides a container image for running Jenkins. This image
provides a Jenkins server instance, which can be used to set up a basic flow for
continuous testing, integration, and delivery.

The image is based on the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html-single/getting_started_with_containers/index#using_red_hat_base_container_images_standard_and_minimal[Red
Hat Universal Base Images] (UBI).

{product-title} follows the link:https://jenkins.io/changelog-stable/[LTS]
release of Jenkins. {product-title} provides an image that contains Jenkins 2.x.

The {product-title} Jenkins images are available on `quay.io` or
`registry.redhat.io`.

For example:

----
$ docker pull registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-jenkins:<v4.3.0>
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these registries
or push them into your {product-title} container image registry. Additionally,
you can create an ImageStream that points to the image, either in your container
image registry or at the external location. Your {product-title} resources can
then reference the ImageStream.

But for convenience, {product-title} provides ImageStreams in the `openshift` namespace
for the core Jenkins image as well as the example Agent images provided for {product-title}
integration with Jenkins.

== Configuration and customization

You can manage Jenkins authentication in two ways:

* {product-title} OAuth authentication provided by the OpenShift Login
plug-in.
* Standard authentication provided by Jenkins.

== Jenkins cross volume mount points

The Jenkins image can be run with mounted volumes to enable persistent storage
for the configuration:

* `/var/lib/jenkins` - This is the data directory where Jenkins stores
configuration files, including job definitions.
