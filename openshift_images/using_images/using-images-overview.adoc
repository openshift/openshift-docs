Use the following topics to discover the different Source-to-Image (S2I),
database, and other container images that are available for {product-title}
users.

Red Hat’s official container images are provided in the Red Hat Registry at
link:https://registry.redhat.io[registry.redhat.io]. {product-title}’s supported S2I,
database, and Jenkins images are provided in the `openshift4` repository in the
Red Hat Quay Registry. For example,
`quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-<address>` is the name of the OpenShift
Application Platform image.

The xPaaS middleware images are provided in their respective product
repositories on the Red Hat Registry but suffixed with a `-openshift`. For
example, `registry.redhat.io/jboss-eap-6/eap64-openshift` is the name of the
JBoss EAP image.

All Red Hat supported images covered in this section are described in the Red Hat
Container Catalog. For every version of each image, you can find details on its
contents and usage. Browse or search for the image that interests you.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The newer versions of container images are not compatible with earlier versions
of {product-title}. Verify and use the correct version of container images,
based on your version of {product-title}.
