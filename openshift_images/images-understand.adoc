Containers, images, and imagestreams are important concepts
to understand when you set out to create and manage containerized software.
An image holds a set of software that is ready to run,
while a container is a running instance of a container image.
An imagestream provides a way of storing different versions of the
same basic image. Those different versions are represented by different
tags on the same image name.
