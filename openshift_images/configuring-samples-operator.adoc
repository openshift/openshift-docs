[IMPORTANT]
.Cluster Samples Operator is being downsized  
====
* Starting from {product-title} 4.13, Cluster Samples Operator is downsized. Cluster Samples Operator will stop providing the following updates for non-Source-to-Image (Non-S2I) image streams and templates:
- new image streams and templates
- updates to the existing image streams and templates unless it is a CVE update

* Cluster Samples Operator will provide support for Non-S2I image streams and templates as per the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#dates[{product-title} lifecycle policy dates and support guidelines].

* Cluster Samples Operator will continue to support the S2I builder image streams and templates and accept the updates. S2I image streams and templates include:
- Ruby
- Python
- Node.js
- Perl
- PHP
- HTTPD
- Nginx
- EAP
- Java
- Webserver
- .NET
- Go

* Starting from {product-title} 4.16, Cluster Samples Operator will stop managing non-S2I image streams and templates. You can contact the image stream or template owner for any requirements and future plans. In addition, refer to the link:https://github.com/openshift/library/blob/master/official.yaml[list of the repositories hosting the image stream or templates].

* If the Cluster Samples Operator is removed during installation, you can xref:../openshift_images/samples-operator-alt-registry.adoc#samples-operator-alt-registry[use the Cluster Samples Operator with an alternate registry] so content can be imported, and then set the Cluster Samples Operator to `Managed` to get the samples.
// Restricted network not supported ROSA/OSD 
ifndef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* To ensure the Cluster Samples Operator bootstraps as `Removed` in a restricted network installation with initial network access to defer samples installation until you have decided which samples are desired, follow the instructions for xref:../installing/install_config/installing-customizing.adoc#installing-customizing[customizing nodes] to override the Cluster Samples Operator default configuration and initially come up as `Removed`.
** To host samples in your disconnected environment, follow the instructions for xref:../openshift_images/samples-operator-alt-registry.adoc#samples-operator-alt-registry[using the Cluster Samples Operator with an alternate registry].
