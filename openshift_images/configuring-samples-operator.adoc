toc::[]

The Cluster Samples Operator, which operates in the `openshift` namespace, installs and
updates the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)-based {product-title} imagestreams
and {product-title} templates.

== Prerequisites
* Deploy an {product-title} cluster.

//Add any other prereqs that are always valid before you modify the CRD.
//If you must configure a different resource before you configure this one, point it out here.

* If the Cluster Samples Operator is removed during installation, you can xref:../openshift_images/samples-operator-alt-registry.adoc#samples-operator-alt-registry[use the Cluster Samples Operator with an alternate registry].
* To ensure the Cluster Samples Operator bootstraps as `Removed` in a restricted network installation with initial network access in order to defer samples installation until you have decided which samples are desired, follow the instructions for xref:../openshift_images/samples-operator-alt-registry.adoc#samples-operator-alt-registry[using the Cluster Samples Operator with an alternate registry] and xref:../installing/install_config/installing-customizing.adoc#installing-customizing[Customizing nodes], to override the Cluster Samples Operator default configuration and initially come up as `Removed`.
