[IMPORTANT]
.The Cluster Samples Operator is being deprecated  
====
* Starting from {product-title} 4.16, the Cluster Samples Operator is deprecated. No new templates, samples, or non-Source-to-Image (Non-S2I) image streams will be added to the Cluster Samples Operator. However, the existing S2I builder image streams and templates will continue to receive updates until the Cluster Samples Operator is removed in a future release. S2I image streams and templates include:
- Ruby
- Python
- Node.js
- Perl
- PHP
- HTTPD
- Nginx
- EAP
- Java
- Webserver
- .NET
- Go

* The Cluster Samples Operator will stop managing and providing support to the non-S2I samples (image streams and templates). You can contact the image stream or template owner for any requirements and future plans. In addition, refer to the link:https://github.com/openshift/library/blob/master/official.yaml[list of the repositories hosting the image stream or templates].

* If the Cluster Samples Operator is removed during installation, you can xref:../openshift_images/samples-operator-alt-registry.adoc#samples-operator-alt-registry[use the Cluster Samples Operator with an alternate registry] so content can be imported, and then set the Cluster Samples Operator to `Managed` to get the samples.
// Restricted network not supported ROSA/OSD 
ifndef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* To ensure the Cluster Samples Operator bootstraps as `Removed` in a restricted network installation with initial network access to defer samples installation until you have decided which samples are desired, follow the instructions for xref:../installing/install_config/installing-customizing.adoc#installing-customizing[customizing nodes] to override the Cluster Samples Operator default configuration and initially come up as `Removed`.
** To host samples in your disconnected environment, follow the instructions for xref:../openshift_images/samples-operator-alt-registry.adoc#samples-operator-alt-registry[using the Cluster Samples Operator with an alternate registry].
