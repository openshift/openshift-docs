* If the Cluster Samples Operator is removed during installation, you can xref:../openshift_images/samples-operator-alt-registry.adoc#samples-operator-alt-registry[use the Cluster Samples Operator with an alternate registry] so content can be imported, and then set the Cluster Samples Operator to `Managed` to get the samples.
* To ensure the Cluster Samples Operator bootstraps as `Removed` in a restricted network installation with initial network access to defer samples installation until you have decided which samples are desired, follow the instructions for xref:../installing/install_config/installing-customizing.adoc#installing-customizing[customizing nodes] to override the Cluster Samples Operator default configuration and initially come up as `Removed`.
** To host samples in your disconnected environment, follow the instructions for xref:../openshift_images/samples-operator-alt-registry.adoc#samples-operator-alt-registry[using the Cluster Samples Operator with an alternate registry].
