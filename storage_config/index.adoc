After completing the initial installation of an {product-title} cluster (see the
xref:../install_config/index.adoc#install-config-index[Installation and
Configuration] documentation first for installation instructions), you can
configure your cluster to support provisioning
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent
storage] resources depending on your application needs, giving end users a way
to request those resources without having any knowledge of the underlying
infrastructure.

[NOTE]
====
See xref:../dev_guide/persistent_volumes.adoc#dev-guide-persistent-volumes[Using
Persistent Volumes] and
xref:../dev_guide/volumes.adoc#dev-guide-volumes[Managing Volumes] in the
Developer Guide for a look at how end users can request persistent storage in
their projects.
====

There are two methods available for configuring your {product-title} cluster
with persistent storage:

- *Volume Plug-ins*: The Kubernetes volume plug-in framework allows you to
provision an {product-title} cluster with persistent storage using networked
storage available in your environment. Using this volume plug-in method, the
following storage technologies are currently supported:
** xref:../storage_config/volume_plugins/nfs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-nfs[NFS]
** xref:../storage_config/volume_plugins/glusterfs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-glusterfs[GlusterFS]
** xref:../storage_config/volume_plugins/cinder.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-cinder[OpenStack
Cinder]
** xref:../storage_config/volume_plugins/ceph_rbd.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-ceph-rbd[Ceph
RBD]
** xref:../storage_config/volume_plugins/aws.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-aws[AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS)]
** xref:../storage_config/volume_plugins/gce.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-gce[GCE
Persistent Disk]
** xref:../storage_config/volume_plugins/iscsi.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-iscsi[iSCSI]
** xref:../storage_config/volume_plugins/fibre_channel.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-fibre-channel[Fibre Channel]

- *Containerized Storage*: Alternatively, you can deploy containerized storage
directly on your {product-title} cluster. Using this containerized storage
converged with {product-title} method, the following storage technologies are
currently supported:
** xref:../storage_config/containerized/glusterfs.adoc#storage-config-containerized-gluster[GlusterFS]

The following topics detail how to configure your {product-title} cluster using
the persistent volume method and underlying storage technology of your choice.
The topics in
xref:../storage_config/storage_examples/index.html#install-config-storage-examples-index[Persistent
Storage Examples] also provide detailed walkthroughs for various use cases.
