You can install the Cluster Application Migration Operator on your {product-title} {product-version} target cluster and 4.1 source cluster. The Cluster Application Migration Operator installs the Cluster Application Migration (CAM) tool on the target cluster by default.

[NOTE]
====
Optional: You can configure the Cluster Application Migration Operator to install the CAM tool link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/5064151[on an {product-title} 3 cluster or on a remote cluster].
====

In a restricted environment, you can install the Cluster Application Migration Operator from a local mirror registry.

After you have installed the Cluster Application Migration Operator on your clusters, you can launch the CAM tool.

== Installing the Cluster Application Migration Operator

You can install the Cluster Application Migration Operator with the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) on an {product-title} {product-version} target cluster and on an {product-title} 4.1 source cluster.
