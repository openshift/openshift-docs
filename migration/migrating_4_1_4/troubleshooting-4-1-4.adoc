You can view the migration Custom Resources (CRs) and download logs to troubleshoot a failed migration.

If the application was stopped during the failed migration, you must roll it back manually in order to prevent data corruption.

[NOTE]
====
Manual rollback is not required if the application was not stopped during migration because the original application is still running on the source cluster.
