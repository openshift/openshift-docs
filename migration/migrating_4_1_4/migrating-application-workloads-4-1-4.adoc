You can migrate application workloads from {product-title} 4.1 to {product-version} with the Cluster Application Migration (CAM) tool. The CAM tool enables you to control the migration and to minimize application downtime.

[NOTE]
====
You can migrate between {product-title} clusters of the same version, for example, from 4.1 to 4.1, as long as the source and target clusters are configured correctly.
====

The CAM tool's web console and API, based on Kubernetes Custom Resources, enable you to migrate stateful and stateless application workloads at the granularity of a namespace.

The CAM tool supports the file system and snapshot data copy methods for migrating data from the source cluster to the target cluster. You can select a method that is suited for your environment and is supported by your storage provider.

You can use migration hooks to run Ansible playbooks at certain points during the migration. The hooks are added when you create a migration plan.
