You can migrate application workloads from {product-title} 4.2 to {product-version} with the Cluster Application Migration (CAM) tool. The CAM tool enables you to control the migration and to minimize application downtime.

The CAM tool's web console and API, based on Kubernetes Custom Resources, enable you to migrate stateful and stateless application workloads at the granularity of a namespace.
