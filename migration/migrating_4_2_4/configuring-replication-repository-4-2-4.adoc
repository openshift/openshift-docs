You must configure an object storage to use as a replication repository. The {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) copies data from the source cluster to the replication repository, and then from the replication repository to the target cluster.

{mtc-short} supports the xref:../../migration/migrating_4_2_4/migrating-application-workloads-4-2-4.adoc#migration-understanding-data-copy-methods_migrating-4-2-4[file system and snapshot data copy methods] for migrating data from the source cluster to the target cluster. You can select a method that is suited for your environment and is supported by your storage provider.

The following storage providers are supported:

* xref:../../migration/migrating_4_2_4/configuring-replication-repository-4-2-4.adoc#migration-configuring-mcg_migrating-4-2-4[Multi-Cloud Object Gateway (MCG)]
* xref:../../migration/migrating_4_2_4/configuring-replication-repository-4-2-4.adoc#migration-configuring-aws-s3_migrating-4-2-4[Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3]
* xref:../../migration/migrating_4_2_4/configuring-replication-repository-4-2-4.adoc#migration-configuring-gcp_migrating-4-2-4[Google Cloud Provider (GCP)]
* xref:../../migration/migrating_4_2_4/configuring-replication-repository-4-2-4.adoc#migration-configuring-azure_migrating-4-2-4[Microsoft Azure]
* Generic S3 object storage, for example, Minio or Ceph S3

In a restricted environment, you can create an internally hosted replication repository.

.Prerequisites

* All clusters must have uninterrupted network access to the replication repository.
* If you use a proxy server with an internally hosted replication repository, you must ensure that the proxy allows access to the replication repository.
