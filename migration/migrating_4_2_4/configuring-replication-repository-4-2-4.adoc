You must configure an object storage to use as a replication repository. The Cluster Application Migration tool copies data from the source cluster to the replication repository, and then from the replication repository to the target cluster.

The CAM tool supports the xref:../../migration/migrating_4_2_4/migrating-application-workloads-4-2-4.adoc#migration-understanding-data-copy-methods_migrating-4-2-4[file system and snapshot data copy methods] for migrating data from the source cluster to the target cluster. You can select a method that is suited for your environment and is supported by your storage provider.

The following storage providers are supported:

* xref:../../migration/migrating_4_2_4/configuring-replication-repository-4-2-4.adoc#migration-configuring-mcg_migrating-4-2-4[Multi-Cloud Object Gateway (MCG)]
* xref:../../migration/migrating_4_2_4/configuring-replication-repository-4-2-4.adoc#migration-configuring-aws-s3_migrating-4-2-4[Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3]
* xref:../../migration/migrating_4_2_4/configuring-replication-repository-4-2-4.adoc#migration-configuring-gcp_migrating-4-2-4[Google Cloud Provider (GCP)]
* xref:../../migration/migrating_4_2_4/configuring-replication-repository-4-2-4.adoc#migration-configuring-azure_migrating-4-2-4[Microsoft Azure]
* Generic S3 object storage, for example, Minio or Ceph S3

The source and target clusters must have network access to the replication repository during migration.

In a restricted environment, you can create an internally hosted replication repository. If you use a proxy server, you must ensure that your replication repository is whitelisted.
