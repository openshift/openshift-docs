You can install the {mtc-full} Operator on your {product-title} {product-version} target cluster and 4.2 source cluster. The {mtc-full} Operator installs the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) on the target cluster by default.

[NOTE]
====
Optional: You can configure the {mtc-full} Operator to install the {mtc-short} link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/5064151[on an {product-title} 3 cluster or on a remote cluster].
====

In a restricted environment, you can install the {mtc-full} Operator from a local mirror registry.

After you have installed the {mtc-full} Operator on your clusters, you can launch the {mtc-short} web console.

== Installing the {mtc-full} Operator

You can install the {mtc-full} Operator with the Operator Lifecycle Manager on an {product-title} {product-version} target cluster and on an {product-title} 4.1 source cluster.
