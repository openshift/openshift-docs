= Migrating {product-title} 3.x to 4.2

toc::[]

You can migrate application workloads from {product-title} 3.7 (and later) to {product-title} 4.2 with the Cluster Application Migration (CAM) tool. The CAM tool enables you to control the migration and to minimize application downtime.

The CAM tool's web console and API, based on Kubernetes custom resources, enable you to migrate stateful application workloads at the granularity of a namespace.

You can migrate data to a different storage class, for example, from Red Hat Gluster Storage or NFS storage on an {product-title} 3.x cluster to Red Hat Ceph Storage on an {product-title} 4.2 cluster.

Optionally, you can use the xref:migration-understanding-cpma_{context}[Control Plane Migration Assistant (CPMA)] to assist you in migrating control plane settings.

.Prerequisites

* The source cluster must be {product-title} 3.7 or later.
* The target cluster must be {product-title} 4.2.
* You must have xref:../../cli_reference/openshift_cli/administrator-cli-commands.html#policy[`cluster-admin` privileges] on all clusters.
* You must have `podman` installed.
* You must have a replication repository that supports the S3 API and is accessible to the source and target clusters.
* If your application uses images from the `openshift` namespace, the required versions of the images must be present on the target cluster. If not, you must xref:../../openshift_images/image-streams-manage.html#images-imagestreams-update-tag_image-streams-managing[update the `imagestreamtags` references] to use an available version that is compatible with your application.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the `imagestreamtags` cannot be updated, you can manually upload equivalent images to the application namespaces and update the applications to reference them.

The following `imagestreamtags` have been _removed_ from {product-title} 4.2:

* `dotnet:1.0`, `dotnet:1.1`, `dotnet:2.0`
* `dotnet-runtime:2.0`
* `mariadb:10.1`
* `mongodb:2.4`, `mongodb:2.6`
* `mysql:5.5`, `mysql:5.6`
* `nginx:1.8`
* `nodejs:0.10`, `nodejs:4`, `nodejs:6`
* `perl:5.16`, `perl:5.20`
* `php:5.5`, `php:5.6`
* `postgresql:9.2`, `postgresql:9.4`, `postgresql:9.5`
* `python:3.3`, `python:3.4`
* `ruby:2.0`, `ruby:2.2`

== Installing the Cluster Application Migration tool

Installing the CAM tool involves the following steps:

. Installing the CAM Operator manually on the {product-title} 3 source cluster
. Installing the CAM Operator with OLM on the {product-title} 4 target cluster
. Configuring cross-origin resource sharing on the source cluster to enable communication with the CAM tool on the target cluster
