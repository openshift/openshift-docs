You can analyze your control plane settings and generate Custom Resource (CR) manifest files with the Control Plane Migration Assistant (CPMA). The CPMA is a CLI-based tool that assists you in migrating the control plane from {product-title} 3.x to {product-title} {product-version}. The CPMA processes configuration files and generates CR manifest files, which are consumed by the {product-title} {product-version} Operators.
