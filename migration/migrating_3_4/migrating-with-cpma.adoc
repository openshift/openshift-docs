The Control Plane Migration Assistant (CPMA) is a CLI-based tool that assists you in migrating the control plane from {product-title} 3.7 (or later) to {product-version}. The CPMA processes the {product-title} 3 configuration files and generates Custom Resource (CR) manifest files, which are consumed by {product-title} {product-version} Operators.
