You can migrate application workloads from {product-title} 3.7, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11 to {product-title} {product-version} with the Cluster Application Migration (CAM) tool. The CAM tool enables you to control the migration and to minimize application downtime.

The CAM tool's web console and API, based on Kubernetes Custom Resources, enable you to migrate stateful application workloads at the granularity of a namespace.

The CAM tool supports the file system and snapshot data copy methods for migrating data from the source cluster to the target cluster. You can select a method that is suited for your environment and is supported by your storage provider.

You can use migration hooks to run Ansible playbooks at certain points during the migration. The hooks are added when you create a migration plan.

[NOTE]
====
The service catalog is deprecated in {product-title} 4. You can migrate workload resources provisioned with the service catalog from {product-title} 3 to 4 but you cannot perform service catalog actions, such as `provision`, `deprovision`, or `update`, on these workloads after migration.

The CAM tool displays a message about service catalog resources, for example, `ClusterServiceClass`, `ServiceInstance`, or `ServiceBinding`, that cannot be migrated.
====

The Control Plane Migration Assistant (CPMA) is a CLI-based tool that assists you in migrating the control plane. The CPMA processes the {product-title} 3 configuration files and generates Custom Resource (CR) manifest files, which are consumed by {product-title} {product-version} Operators.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you begin your migration, be sure to review the information on xref:../../migration/migrating_3_4/planning-migration-3-to-4.adoc#planning-migration-3-to-4[planning your migration].
