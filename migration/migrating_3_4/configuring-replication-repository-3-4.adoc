You must configure an object storage to use as a replication repository. The Cluster Application Migration tool copies data from the source cluster to the replication repository, and then from the replication repository to the target cluster.

The following storage providers are supported:

* Multi-Cloud Object Gateway (MCG)
* Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3
* Google Cloud Provider (GCP)
* Microsoft Azure
* Generic S3 object storage, for example, Minio or Ceph S3
