You can migrate application workloads from {product-title} 3.7 (and later) to {product-title} {product-version} with the Cluster Application Migration (CAM) tool. The CAM tool enables you to control the migration and to minimize application downtime.

The CAM tool's web console and API, based on Kubernetes Custom Resources, enable you to migrate stateful application workloads at the granularity of a namespace.

You can use the Control Plane Migration Assistant to analyze your control plane settings and convert Custom Resource manifests before migration.
