You can deploy the {mtc-first} on an {product-title} {product-version} target cluster and an {product-title} 3 source cluster by installing the {mtc-operator}. The {mtc-operator} installs the {mtc-first} on the target cluster by default.

[NOTE]
====
Optional: You can configure the {mtc-operator} to install the {mtc-short} link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/5064151[on an {product-title} 3 cluster or on a remote cluster].
====

In a restricted environment, you can install the {mtc-operator} from a local mirror registry.

After you have installed the {mtc-operator} on your clusters, you can launch the {mtc-short} web console.

== Installing the {mtc-operator}

You can install the {mtc-operator} with the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) on an {product-title} {product-version} target cluster and manually on an {product-title} 3 source cluster.

== Installing the {mtc-operator} in a restricted environment

You can install the {mtc-operator} with the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) on an {product-title} {product-version} target cluster and manually on an {product-title} 3 source cluster.

For {product-title} {product-version}, you can build a custom Operator catalog image, push it to a local mirror image registry, and configure OLM to install the {mtc-operator} from the local registry. A `mapping.txt` file is created when you run the `oc adm catalog mirror` command.

On the {product-title} 3 cluster, you can create a manifest file based on the Operator image and edit the file to point to your local image registry. The `image` value in the manifest file uses the `sha256` value from the `mapping.txt` file. Then, you can use the local image to create the {mtc-operator}.
