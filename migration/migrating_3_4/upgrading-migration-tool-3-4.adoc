You can upgrade the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) by installing the latest {mtc-full} Operator.

[IMPORTANT]

You must ensure that the same Operator version is installed on the source and target clusters.

Do not enable automatic updates on the {product-title} {product-version} cluster.
====

If you are upgrading {mtc-short} 1.3, you must perform an additional procedure to update the `MigPlan` custom resource (CR).
