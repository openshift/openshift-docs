You can migrate application workloads from {product-title} 3.7 (and later) to {product-title} {product-version} with the Cluster Application Migration (CAM) tool. The CAM tool enables you to control the migration and to minimize application downtime.

The CAM tool's web console and API, based on Kubernetes Custom Resources, enable you to migrate stateful application workloads at the granularity of a namespace.

Optionally, you can use the xref:../../migration/migrating_3_4/migrating-with-cpma.adoc#migration-understanding-cpma_{context}[Control Plane Migration Assistant (CPMA)] to assist you in migrating control plane settings.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you begin your migration, be sure to review the information on xref:../../migration/migrating_3_4/planning-migration-3-to-4.adoc#planning-migration-3-to-4[planning your migration].
