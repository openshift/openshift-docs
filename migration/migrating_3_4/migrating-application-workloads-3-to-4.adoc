toc::[]

You can migrate application workloads from {product-title} 3.7 (and later) to {product-title} {product-version} with the {mtc-first}. The {mtc-short} enables you to control the migration and to minimize application downtime.

The {mtc-short}'s web console and API, based on Kubernetes Custom Resources, enable you to migrate stateful application workloads at the granularity of a namespace.

Optionally, you can use the xref:../../migration/migrating_3_4/migrating-with-cpma.adoc#migration-understanding-cpma_{context}[Control Plane Migration Assistant (CPMA)] to assist you in migrating control plane settings.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you begin your migration, be sure to review the information on xref:../../migration/migrating_3_4/planning-migration-3-to-4.adoc#planning-migration-3-to-4[planning your migration].
