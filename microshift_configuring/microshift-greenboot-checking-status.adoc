toc::[]

To deploy applications or make other changes through the {microshift-short} API with tools other than `kustomize` manifests, you must wait until the greenboot health checks have finished. This ensures that your changes are not lost if greenboot rolls your `rpm-ostree` system back to an earlier state.

The `greenboot-healthcheck` service runs one time and then exits. After greenboot has exited and the system is in a healthy state, you can proceed with configuration changes and deployments.
