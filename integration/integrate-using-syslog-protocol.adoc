https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424[Syslog] is an event logging protocol that applications use to send messages to a central location, such as a SIEM or a syslog collector, for data retention and security investigations.
With {product-title}, you can send alerts and audit events using the syslog protocol.

[NOTE]
====
* Forwarding events by using the syslog protocol requires the {product-title} version 3.0.52 or newer.
* When you use the syslog integration, {product-title} forwards both violation alerts that you configure and all audit events.
* Currently, {product-title} only supports *CEF* (Common Event Format).
====

The following steps represent a high-level workflow for integrating {product-title} with a syslog events receiver:

. Set up a syslog events receiver to receive alerts.
. Use the receiver's address and port number to set up notifications in the {product-title}.

After the configuration, {product-title} automatically sends all violations and audit events to the configured syslog receiver.
