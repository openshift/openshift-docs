{product-title} ({product-title-short}) integrates with a variety of continuous integration (CI) products. Before you deploy images, you can use {product-title-short} to apply build-time and deploy-time security rules to your images.

After images are built and pushed to a registry, {product-title-short} integrates into CI pipelines. Pushing the image first allows developers to continue testing their artifacts while dealing with any policy violations alongside any other CI test failures, linter violations, or other problems.

If possible, configure the version control system to block pull or merge requests from being merged if the build stage, which includes {product-title-short} checks, fails.

The integration with your CI product functions by contacting your {product-title-short} installation to check whether the image complies with build-time policies you have configured. If there are policy violations, a detailed message is displayed on the console log, including the policy description, rationale, and remediation instructions.

Each policy includes an optional enforcement setting. If you mark a policy for build-time enforcement, failure of that policy causes the client to exit with a nonzero error code.

To integrate {product-title} with your CI system, follow these steps:

. xref:../integration/integrate-with-ci-systems.adoc#configure-build-policies[Configure build policies].
. xref:../integration/integrate-with-ci-systems.adoc#configure-registry-integration[Configure a registry integration].
. xref:../integration/integrate-with-ci-systems.adoc#configure-access[Configure access] to your {product-title-short} instance.

[id="configure-build-policies"]
== Configuring build policies

You can check {product-title-short} policies during builds.

.Procedure

. Configure policies that apply to the build time of the container lifecycle.
. Integrate with the registry that images are pushed to during the build.

[id="configure-registry-integration"]
== Configuring registry integration

To scan images, you must provide {product-title} with access to the image registry you are using in your build pipeline.

[id="configure-access"]
== Configuring access

{product-title-short} provides the `roxctl` command-line interface (CLI) to make it easy to integrate {product-title-short} policies into your build pipeline.
The `roxctl` CLI prints detailed information about problems and how to fix them so that developers can maintain high standards in the early phases of the container lifecycle.

To securely authenticate to the {product-title} API server, you must create an API token.

[id="install-roxctl-cli-binary"]
=== Installing the roxctl CLI by downloading the binary

You can install the `roxctl` CLI to interact with {product-title} from a
command-line interface. You can install `roxctl` on Linux, Windows, or macOS.

[id="integrate-with-your-ci-pipeline"]
== Integrating with your CI pipeline

After you have finished these procedures, the next step is to integrate with your CI pipeline.

Each CI system might require a slightly different configuration.

=== Using Jenkins

Use the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/stackrox-container-image-scanner[StackRox Container Image Scanner] Jenkins plugin for integrating with Jenkins.
You can use this plugin in both Jenkins freestyle projects and pipelines.
