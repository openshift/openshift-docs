If you are using link:https://www.splunk.com/[Splunk], you can forward alerts from {product-title} to Splunk and view the violations, vulnerability detection, and compliance related data from within Splunk.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, Splunk is not supported on {ibm-power} (`ppc64le`) and {ibm-z} (`s390x`).
====

Depending on your use case, you can integrate {product-title} with Splunk by using the following ways:

* By xref:../integration/integrate-with-splunk.adoc#integrate-splunk-http-event-collector[using an HTTP event collector] in Splunk:
** Use the event collector option to forward alerts and audit log data.
* By xref:../integration/integrate-with-splunk.adoc#integrate-splunk-add-on[using the {product-title} add-on]:
** Use the add-on to pull the violations, vulnerability detection, and compliance data into Splunk.

You can use one or both of these integration options to integrate the {product-title} with Splunk.

. Use the token value to set up notifications in {product-title}.
. Identify policies for which you want to send notifications, and update the notification settings for those policies.

== Using the {product-title} add-on

You can use the {product-title} add-on to forward the vulnerability detection and compliance related data from the {product-title} to Splunk.
