[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} ({product-title-short}) integrates with a variety of image registries so that you can understand your images and apply security policies for image usage.

When you integrate with image registries, you can view important image details, such as image creation date and Dockerfile details (including image layers).

After you integrate {product-title-short} with your registry, you can scan images, view image components, and apply security policies to images before or after deployment.

[NOTE]
====
When you integrate with an image registry, {product-title-short} does not scan all images in your registry. {product-title-short} only scans the images when you:

* Use the images in deployments
* Use the `roxctl` CLI to check images
* Use a continuous integration (CI) system to enforce security policies
====

You can integrate {product-title-short} with major image registries, including:

== Manually configuring image registries

If you are using GCR, you must manually create image registry integrations.

==== Using assumerole with Amazon ECR

You can use link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html[AssumeRole] to grant access to AWS resources without manually configuring each user's permissions.
Instead, you can define a role with the desired permissions so that the user is granted access to assume that role. `AssumeRole` enables you to grant, revoke, or otherwise generally manage more fine-grained permissions.
