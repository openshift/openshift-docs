[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} integrates with a variety of image registries so that you can understand your images and apply security policies for image usage.

When you integrate with image registries, you can view important image details, such as image creation date and Dockerfile details (including image layers).

After you integrate {product-title} with your registry, you can scan images, view image components, or apply security policies before you deploy images or to existing images that are already deployed in your clusters.

[NOTE]
====
When you integrate with an image registry, {product-title} does not scan all images in your registry.
{product-title} only scans the images when you:

* Use the images in deployments
* Use the `roxctl` CLI to check images
* Use a continuous integration (CI) system to enforce security policies
====

You can integrate {product-title} with several major image registries, including:

== Manually configuring image registries

If you are using GCR or ECR with node IAM, you must manually create image registry integrations.

==== Using assumerole with Amazon ECR

link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html[AssumeRole] allows access to AWS resources without manually configuring each user's permissions.
Instead, you can define a role with the desired permissions, and the user is granted access to assume that role.
AssumeRole allows more fine-grain permissions to be granted, revoked, and otherwise generally managed.
