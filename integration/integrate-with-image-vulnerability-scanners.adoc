[role="_abstract"]
{rh-rhacs-first} integrates with vulnerability scanners to enable you to import your container images and watch them for vulnerabilities.

[discrete]
== Supported container image registries

Red{nbsp}Hat supports the following container image registries:

* Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
* Generic Docker registries (any generic Docker or Open Container Initiative-compliant image registries, for example, DockerHub, `gcr.io`, `mcr.microsoft.com`)
* Google Container Registry
* Google Artifact Registry
* IBM Cloud Container Registry
* JFrog Artifactory
* Microsoft Azure Container Registry (ACR)
* Red{nbsp}Hat Quay
* Red{nbsp}Hat registry (`registry.redhat.io`, `registry.access.redhat.com`)
* Sonatype Nexus

This enhanced support gives you greater flexibility and choice in managing your container images in your preferred registry.

== Scanners included in {product-title-short}

* Scanner V4: Beginning with {product-title-short} version 4.4, a new scanner is introduced that is built on link:https://github.com/quay/claircore[Claircore], which also powers the link:https://github.com/quay/clair[Clair] scanner. Scanner V4 supports scanning of language and OS-specific image components. Scanner V4 is enabled by default during installation beginning in release 4.8. For more information about Scanner V4, including links to the installation documentation, see xref:../operating/examine-images-for-vulnerabilities.adoc#about-scanner-v4_examine-images-for-vulnerabilities[About {product-title-short} Scanner V4].
* StackRox Scanner: This scanner was the default scanner in {product-title-short} before being replaced by Scanner V4. It originates from a fork of the Clair v2 open source scanner. If delegated scanning is configured and only the StackRox Scanner is installed on secured clusters, StackRox Scanner must also be enabled on the cluster where Central is installed or delegated scanning will not work.

[id="alternative-scanners_{context}"]
== Alternative scanners

* link:https://github.com/quay/clair[Clair]: Scanner V4 in {product-title-short} offers functionality provided by Claircore, which also powers the Clair V4 scanner. You can configure {product-title-short} to use Clair V4 instead of Scanner V4 by configuring an integration.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Scanner V4 is the preferred image vulnerability scanner to use with {product-title-short}, because only Scanner V4 provides full functionality and features.
====

If you use one of these alternative scanners in your DevOps workflow, you can use the {product-title-short} portal to configure an integration with your vulnerability scanner. After the integration, the {product-title-short} portal shows the image vulnerabilities and you can triage them easily. However,  Scanner V4 provides functionality and features that alternative scanners might not offer.

If multiple scanners are configured, {product-title-short} tries to use the non-StackRox/{product-title-short} and non-Clair scanners. If those scanners fail, {product-title-short} tries to use a configured Clair scanner. If that fails, {product-title-short} tries to use Scanner V4. If Scanner V4 is not enabled, {product-title-short} tries to use the StackRox Scanner.
