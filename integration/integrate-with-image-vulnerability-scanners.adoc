{rh-rhacscs-first} integrates with several vulnerability scanners to enable you to import your container images and watch them for vulnerabilities.

== Supported container image registries

Red Hat supports the following container image registries:

* Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
* Generic Docker registries (any generic Docker or Open Container Initiative-compliant image registries, for example, DockerHub, `gcr.io`, `mcr.microsoft.com`)
* Google Container Registry
* Google Artifact Registry
* IBM Cloud Container Registry
* JFrog Artifactory
* Microsoft Azure Container Registry (ACR)
* Red Hat Quay
* Red Hat registry (`registry.redhat.io`, `registry.access.redhat.com`)
* Sonatype Nexus

This enhanced support gives you greater flexibility and choice in managing your container images in your preferred registry.

== Supported Scanners

You can set up {product-title-short} to obtain image vulnerability data from the following commercial container image vulnerability scanners:

* {product-title-short} Scanner (recommended)
* link:https://github.com/quay/clair[Clair]
* link:https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/container-analysis[Google Container Analysis]
* link:https://quay.io[Red Hat Quay]

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title-short} Scanner is the preferred image vulnerability scanner to use with {product-title-short}.
For more information about scanning container images with {product-title-short} Scanner, see xref:../operating/examine-images-for-vulnerabilities.adoc#scanning-images_examine-images-for-vulnerabilities[Scanning images].
====

If you use one of these products in your DevOps workflow, you can use the {product-title-short} portal to configure an integration with your vulnerability scanner. After the integration, the {product-title-short} portal shows the image vulnerabilities and you can triage them easily.
