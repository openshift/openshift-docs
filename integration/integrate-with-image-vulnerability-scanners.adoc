{rh-rhacs-first} integrates with vulnerability scanners to enable you to import your container images and watch them for vulnerabilities.

[discrete]
== Supported container image registries

Red{nbsp}Hat supports the following container image registries:

* Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
* Generic Docker registries (any generic Docker or Open Container Initiative-compliant image registries, for example, DockerHub, `gcr.io`, `mcr.microsoft.com`)
* Google Container Registry
* Google Artifact Registry
* IBM Cloud Container Registry
* JFrog Artifactory
* Microsoft Azure Container Registry (ACR)
* Red{nbsp}Hat Quay
* Red{nbsp}Hat registry (`registry.redhat.io`, `registry.access.redhat.com`)
* Sonatype Nexus

This enhanced support gives you greater flexibility and choice in managing your container images in your preferred registry.

== Supported Scanners

You can set up {product-title-short} to obtain image vulnerability data from the following commercial container image vulnerability scanners:

[discrete]
=== Scanners included in {product-title-short}

* Scanner V4: Beginning with {product-title-short} version 4.4, a new scanner is introduced that is built on link:https://github.com/quay/claircore[ClairCore], which also powers the link:https://github.com/quay/clair[Clair] scanner. Scanner V4 supports scanning of language and OS-specific image components. You do not have to create an integration to use this scanner, but you must enable it during or after installation. For version 4.4, if you enable this scanner, you must also enable the StackRox Scanner. For more information about Scanner V4, including links to the installation documentation, see xref:../operating/examine-images-for-vulnerabilities.adoc#about-scanner-v4_examine-images-for-vulnerabilities[About {product-title-short} Scanner V4].
* StackRox Scanner: This scanner is the default scanner in {product-title-short}. It originates from a fork of the Clair v2 open source scanner.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Even if you have Scanner V4 enabled, at this time, the StackRox Scanner must still be enabled to provide scanning of RHCOS nodes and platform vulnerabilities such as {osp}, Kubernetes, and Istio. Support for that functionality in Scanner V4 is planned for a future release. Do not disable the StackRox Scanner.

=== Alternative scanners

* link:https://github.com/quay/clair[Clair]: As of version 4.4, you can enable Scanner V4 in {product-title-short} to provide functionality provided by ClairCore, which also powers the Clair V4 scanner. However, you can configure Clair V4 as the scanner by configuring an integration.

* link:https://quay.io[Red{nbsp}Hat Quay]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The StackRox Scanner, in conjunction with Scanner V4 (optional), is the preferred image vulnerability scanner to use with {product-title-short}.
For more information about scanning container images with the StackRox Scanner and Scanner V4, see xref:../operating/examine-images-for-vulnerabilities.adoc#scanning-images_examine-images-for-vulnerabilities[Scanning images].
====

If you use one of these alternative scanners in your DevOps workflow, you can use the {product-title-short} portal to configure an integration with your vulnerability scanner. After the integration, the {product-title-short} portal shows the image vulnerabilities and you can triage them easily.

If multiple scanners are configured, {product-title-short} tries to use the non-StackRox/{product-title-short} and Clair scanners. If those scanners fail, {product-title-short} tries to use a configured Clair scanner. If that fails, {product-title-short} tries to use Scanner V4, if configured. If Scanner V4 is not configured, {product-title-short} tries to use the StackRox Scanner.
