= Installing a cluster on {oci-first-no-rt} by using the Agent-based Installer
:context: installing-oci-agent-based-installer

toc::[]

In {product-title} {product-version}, you can use the Agent-based Installer to install a cluster on {oci-first}, so that you can run cluster workloads on infrastructure that supports dedicated, hybrid, public, and multiple cloud environments.

Installing a cluster on {oci} is supported for virtual machines (VMs) and bare-metal machines.

== Installation process workflow

The following workflow describes a high-level outline for the process of installing an {product-title} cluster on {oci} using the Agent-based Installer:

. Create {oci} resources and services (Oracle).
. Disconnected environments: Prepare a web server that is accessible by {oci} instances (Red{nbsp}Hat).
. Prepare configuration files for the Agent-based Installer (Red{nbsp}Hat).
. Generate the agent ISO image (Red{nbsp}Hat).
. Disconnected environments: Upload the rootfs image to the web server (Red{nbsp}Hat).
. Configure your firewall for {product-title} (Red{nbsp}Hat).
. Upload the agent ISO image to a storage bucket (Oracle).
. Create a custom image from the uploaded agent ISO image (Oracle).
. Create compute instances on {oci} (Oracle).
. Verify that your cluster runs on {oci} (Oracle).
