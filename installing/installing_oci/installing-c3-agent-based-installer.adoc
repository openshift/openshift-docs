= Installing a cluster on {oci-c3-no-rt} by using the Agent-based Installer
:context: installing-c3-agent-based-installer

toc::[]

You can use the Agent-based Installer to install a cluster on {oci-c3}, so that you can run cluster workloads on on-premise infrastructure while still using {oci-first} services.

== Installation process workflow

The following workflow describes a high-level outline for the process of installing an {product-title} cluster on {oci-c3-short} using the Agent-based Installer:

. Create {oci-c3-short} resources and services (Oracle).
. Prepare configuration files for the Agent-based Installer (Red{nbsp}Hat).
. Generate the agent ISO image (Red{nbsp}Hat).
. Convert the ISO image to an {oci-first-no-rt} image, upload it to an {oci} Home Region Bucket, and then import the uploaded image to the {oci-c3-short} system (Oracle).
. Disconnected environments: Prepare a web server that is accessible by {oci} instances (Red{nbsp}Hat).
. Disconnected environments: Upload the rootfs image to the web server (Red{nbsp}Hat).
. Configure your firewall for {product-title} (Red{nbsp}Hat).
. Create control plane nodes and configure load balancers (Oracle).
. Create compute nodes and configure load balancers (Oracle).
. Verify that your cluster runs on {oci} (Oracle).
