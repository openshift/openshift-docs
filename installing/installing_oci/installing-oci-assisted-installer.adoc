= Installing a cluster on {oci-first-no-rt} by using the {ai-full}
:context: installing-oci-assisted-installer

toc::[]

You can use the {ai-full} to install a cluster on {oci-first}. This method is recommended for most users, and requires an internet connection.

If you want to set up the cluster manually or using other automation tools, or if you are working in a disconnected environment, you can use the Red Hat Agent-based Installer for the installation. For details, see xref:../../installing/installing_oci/installing-oci-agent-based-installer.adoc#installing-oci-agent-based-installer[Installing a cluster on {oci-first-no-rt} by using the Agent-based Installer].

[NOTE]
====
You can deploy {product-title} on a link:https://www.oracle.com/uk/cloud/cloud-at-customer/dedicated-region/[Dedicated Region] (Oracle documentation) the same as any region from {oci-first-no-rt}.

== Completing the remaining {ai-full} steps

After you provision {oci-first} resources and upload {product-title} custom manifest configuration files to {oci}, you must complete the remaining cluster installation steps on the {ai-full} before you can create an instance {oci}. These steps include assigning node roles and adding custom manifests.
