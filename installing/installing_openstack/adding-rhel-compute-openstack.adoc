The following are additional requirements for xref:../../machine_management/adding-rhel-compute.adoc[Adding RHEL compute machines to an {product-title} cluster],
when the cluster has been deployed on {rh-openstack-first}:

* The RHEL compute nodes being added and the host that executes the playbooks, need to be able to access the cluster api
endpoints using dns resolvable hostnames.

* Security groups must be configured such that RHEL compute nodes and the host executing the playbooks are allowed to
access the cluster api endpoints. This can be tested by trying to access the api tcp port being used by the cluster
from an user account on the hosts.  The default tcp port for api access to the cluster is 6443.
