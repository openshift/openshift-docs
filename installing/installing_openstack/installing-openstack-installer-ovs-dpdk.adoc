toc::[]

If your {rh-openstack-first} deployment has Open vSwitch with the Data Plane Development Kit (OVS-DPDK) enabled, you can install an {product-title} cluster on it. Clusters that run on such {rh-openstack} deployments use OVS-DPDK features by providing access to link:https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/prog_guide/poll_mode_drv.html[poll mode drivers].

== Prerequisites

* Review details about the
xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update]
processes.
** Verify that {product-title} {product-version} is compatible with your {rh-openstack} version by using the "Supported platforms for OpenShift clusters" section. You can also compare platform support across different versions by viewing the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4679401[{product-title} on {rh-openstack} support matrix].

* Have a storage service installed in {rh-openstack}, like block storage (Cinder) or object storage (Swift). Object storage is the recommended storage technology for {product-registry} cluster deployment. For more information, see xref:../../scalability_and_performance/optimization/optimizing-storage.adoc#optimizing-storage[Optimizing storage].

* Have the metadata service enabled in {rh-openstack}.

* Plan your {rh-openstack} OVS-DPDK deployment by referring to link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/16.2/html/network_functions_virtualization_planning_and_configuration_guide/assembly_ovsdpdk_parameters[Planning your OVS-DPDK deployment] in the Network Functions Virtualization Planning and Configuration Guide.

* Configure your {rh-openstack} OVS-DPDK deployment according to link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/16.2/html/network_functions_virtualization_planning_and_configuration_guide/part-dpdk-configure[Configuring an OVS-DPDK deployment] in the Network Functions Virtualization Planning and Configuration Guide.

** You must complete link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/16.2/html/network_functions_virtualization_planning_and_configuration_guide/part-dpdk-configure#p-ovs-dpdk-flavor-deploy-instance[Creating a flavor and deploying an instance for OVS-DPDK] before you install a cluster on {rh-openstack}.

The cluster is operational. Before you can add OVS-DPDK compute machines though, you must perform additional tasks.
