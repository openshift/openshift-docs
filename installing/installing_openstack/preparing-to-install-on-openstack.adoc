== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.

* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].

== Choosing a method to install {product-title} on OpenStack

You can install {product-title} on {rh-openstack-first} by using one of the following deployment methods.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_openstack/installing-openstack-installer-custom.adoc#installing-openstack-installer-custom[Installing a cluster on OpenStack with customizations]**: You can install a customized cluster on {rh-openstack}. The installation program allows for some customization to be applied at the installation stage. Many other customization options are available xref:../../post_installation_configuration/cluster-tasks.adoc#post-install-cluster-tasks[post-installation].

* **xref:../../installing/installing_openstack/installing-openstack-installer-kuryr.adoc#installing-openstack-installer-kuryr[Installing a cluster on OpenStack with Kuryr]**: You can install a customized {product-title} cluster on {rh-openstack} that uses Kuryr SDN. Kuryr and {product-title} integration is primarily designed for {product-title} clusters running on {rh-openstack} VMs. Kuryr improves the network performance by plugging {product-title} pods into {rh-openstack} SDN. In addition, it provides interconnectivity between pods and {rh-openstack} virtual instances.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_openstack/installing-openstack-user.adoc#installing-openstack-user[Installing a cluster on OpenStack on your own infrastructure]**: You can install {product-title} on {rh-openstack} that runs on user-provisioned infrastructure. By using this installation method, you can integrate your cluster with existing infrastructure and modifications. For installations on user-provisioned infrastructure, you must create all {rh-openstack} resources, like Nova servers, Neutron ports, and security groups. You can use the provided Ansible playbooks to assist with the deployment process.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_openstack/installing-openstack-user-kuryr.adoc#installing-openstack-user-kuryr[Installing a cluster on OpenStack with Kuryr on your own infrastructure]**: You can install {product-title} on a user-provisioned {rh-openstack} environment that uses Kuryr SDN.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_openstack/installing-openstack-user-sr-iov.adoc#installing-openstack-user-sr-iov[Installing a cluster on OpenStack on your own SR-IOV infrastructure]**: You can install {product-title} on {rh-openstack} that runs on user-provisioned infrastructure and uses single-root input/output virtualization (SR-IOV) networks to run compute machines.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_openstack/installing-openstack-installer-restricted.adoc#installing-openstack-installer-restricted[Installing a cluster on OpenStack in a restricted network]**: You can install {product-title} on {rh-openstack} in a restricted or disconnected network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content. You can use this method to install a cluster that does not require an active internet connection to obtain the software components. You can also use this installation method to ensure that your clusters only use container images that satisfy your organizational controls on external content.
