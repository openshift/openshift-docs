toc::[]

In {product-title} {product-version}, you can install a cluster on
{rh-openstack-first} in a restricted network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content.

[NOTE]
====
Installing in a restricted network is supported only for installer-provisioned installations.
====

.Prerequisites

* xref:../../installing/installing-mirroring-installation-images.adoc#installing-mirroring-installation-images[Create a registry on your mirror host]
 and obtain the `imageContentSources` data for your version of {product-title}.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the installation media is on the mirror host, you can use that computer to complete all installation steps.
====

* Review details about the
xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update processes].
** Verify that {product-title} {product-version} is compatible with your {rh-openstack} version by consulting the architecture documentation's xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.html#available-platforms_architecture-installation[list of available platforms]. You can also compare platform support across different versions by viewing the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4679401[{product-title} on {rh-openstack} support matrix].

* Verify that your network configuration does not rely on a provider network. Provider networks are not supported.

* Have the metadata service enabled in {rh-openstack}.
