== About the Agent-based Installer

The Agent-based installation method provides the flexibility to boot your on-premises servers in any way that you choose. It combines the ease of use of the Assisted Installation service with the ability to run offline, including in air-gapped environments.
Agent-based installation is a subcommand of the {product-title} installer.
It generates a bootable ISO image containing all of the information required to deploy an {product-title} cluster, with an available release image.

The configuration is in the same format as for the installer-provisioned infrastructure and user-provisioned infrastructure installation methods.
The Agent-based Installer can also optionally generate or accept Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) custom resources. ZTP allows you to provision new edge sites with declarative configurations of bare-metal equipment.

== Requirements for a cluster using the platform "none" option

This section describes the requirements for an Agent-based {product-title} installation that is configured to use the platform `none` option.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Review the information in the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4207611[guidelines for deploying {product-title} on non-tested platforms] before you attempt to install an {product-title} cluster in virtualized or cloud environments.
