== About the Agent-based Installer
The Agent-based Installer is a combination of the Assisted Installer (AI) technology and the installer-provisioned infrastructure (IPI). It is a subcommand that resides in the {product-title} installer and also utilizes the {product-title} installer for the input asset management.
It generates a bootable image containing all of the information required to deploy an {product-title} cluster.

The Agent-based Installer is a sub-command that generates a live {op-system-first} ISO. The live ISO runs all of the required components that are running in containers pulled from the {product-title} release payload.

The Agent-based Installer also utilizes Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) custom resources. ZTP allows you to provision new edge sites with declarative configurations of bare-metal equipment.
