// Reusing applicable content from Disconnected installation mirroring assembly

You can use a mirror registry for disconnected installations and to ensure that your clusters only use container images that satisfy your organization's controls on external content. Before you install a cluster on infrastructure that you provision in a disconnected environment, you must mirror the required container images into that environment. To mirror container images, you must have a registry for mirroring.
