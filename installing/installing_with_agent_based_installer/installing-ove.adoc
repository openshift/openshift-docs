toc::[]

[role="_abstract"]
You can deploy an {product-title} cluster without the need for an external image registry, either in a connected or disconnected environment. This installation method uses a simplified user interface and self-contained media to facilitate the installation.

Although the method supports general clusters, the downloaded media contains an Operator bundle that is curated specifically for {ove-first}, meaning additional Operators must be retrieved separately if required for other use cases.
