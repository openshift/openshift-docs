toc::[]

You can install the {mce-short} and deploy a hub cluster with the Agent-based {product-title} Installer.
The following procedure is partially automated and requires manual steps after the initial cluster is deployed.

== Prerequisites
* You have read the following documentation:
** link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.9/html/clusters/cluster_mce_overview[Cluster lifecycle with multicluster engine operator overview].
** xref:../../storage/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_local/persistent-storage-local.adoc#persistent-storage-using-local-volume[Persistent storage using local volumes].
** xref:../../edge_computing/ztp-deploying-far-edge-clusters-at-scale.adoc#about-ztp_ztp-deploying-far-edge-clusters-at-scale[Using {ztp} to provision clusters at the network far edge].
** xref:../../installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer.adoc#preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer[Preparing to install with the Agent-based Installer].
** xref:../../disconnected/mirroring/index.adoc#installing-mirroring-disconnected-about[About disconnected installation mirroring].
* You have access to the internet to obtain the necessary container images.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* If you are installing in a disconnected environment, you must have a configured local mirror registry for disconnected installation mirroring.
