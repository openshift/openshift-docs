toc::[]

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on
Amazon Web Services (AWS) with customized network configuration options. By
customizing your network configuration, your cluster can coexist with existing
IP address allocations in your environment and integrate with existing MTU and
VXLAN configurations.

You must set most of the network configuration parameters during installation,
and you can modify only `kubeProxy` configuration parameters in a running
cluster.

== Prerequisites

* Review details about the
xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update]
processes.
* xref:../../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.adoc#installing-aws-account[Configure an AWS account]
to host the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have an AWS profile stored on your computer, it must not use a temporary
session token that you generated while using a multi-factor authentication
device. The cluster continues to use your current AWS credentials to
create AWS resources for the entire life of the cluster, so you must
use key-based, long-lived credentials. To generate appropriate keys, see
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html[Managing Access Keys for IAM Users]
in the AWS documentation. You can supply the keys when you run the installation
program.
====
* If you use a firewall, you must
xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configure it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
* If you do not allow the system to manage identity and access management (IAM),
then a cluster administrator can
xref:../../installing/installing_aws/manually-creating-iam.adoc#manually-creating-iam-aws[manually
create and maintain IAM credentials]. Manual mode can also be used in
environments where the cloud IAM APIs are not reachable.
