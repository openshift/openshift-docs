= Installing a cluster on user-provisioned infrastructure in AWS by using CloudFormation templates
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: installing-aws-user-infra

toc::[]

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) that uses infrastructure that you provide.

One way to create this infrastructure is to use the provided CloudFormation templates. You can modify the templates to customize your infrastructure or use the information that they contain to create AWS objects according to your company's policies.

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the
xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update]
processes.
* You xref:../../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.adoc#installing-aws-account[configured an AWS account]
to host the cluster.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have an AWS profile stored on your computer, it must not use a temporary session token that you generated while using a multi-factor authentication device. The cluster continues to use your current AWS credentials to create AWS resources for the entire life of the cluster, so you must use key-based, long-lived credentials. To generate appropriate keys, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html[Managing Access Keys for IAM Users] in the AWS documentation. You can supply the keys when you run the installation program.
====
* You downloaded the AWS CLI and installed it on your computer. See
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-bundle.html[Install the AWS CLI Using the Bundled Installer (Linux, macOS, or Unix)]
in the AWS documentation.
* If you use a firewall, you xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
+
[NOTE]
====
Be sure to also review this site list if you are configuring a proxy.
====
* If you do not allow the system to manage identity and access management (IAM), then a cluster administrator can xref:../../installing/installing_aws/manually-creating-iam.adoc#manually-creating-iam-aws[manually create and maintain IAM credentials]. Manual mode can also be used in environments where the cloud IAM APIs are not reachable.

== Creating worker nodes

You can either manually create worker nodes or use a MachineSet to create worker
nodes after the cluster deploys. If you use a MachineSet to create and maintain
the workers, you can allow the cluster to manage them. This allows you to easily
scale, manage, and upgrade your workers.
