You can expand an {product-title} cluster deployed on AWS by adding bare-metal nodes to the cluster. By default, a cluster deployed on AWS with {product-title} 4.11 or earlier has the Baremetal Operator (BMO) disabled. In {product-title} 4.12 and later releases, the BMO is enabled to support a hybrid cloud consisting of AWS control plane nodes and worker nodes with additional on-premise bare-metal worker nodes.

Expanding an {product-title} cluster deployed on AWS requires using virtual media with bare-metal nodes that meet the xref:../installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-prerequisites.adoc#node-requirements_ipi-install-prerequisites[node requirements] and xref:../installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-prerequisites.adoc#ipi-install-firmware-requirements-for-installing-with-virtual-media_ipi-install-prerequisites[firmware requirements] for installing with virtual media. A `provisioning` network is not required, and if present, should be xref:../installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-installation-workflow.adoc#modifying-install-config-for-no-provisioning-network_ipi-install-installation-workflow[disabled].
