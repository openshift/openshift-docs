You can install {product-title} on {aws-full} using installer-provisioned, user-provisioned infrastructure, or on a single node, depending on the needs of your use case.

The default installation type uses installer-provisioned infrastructure, where the installation program provisions the underlying infrastructure for the cluster.

You can also install {product-title} on infrastructure that you provision. If you do not use infrastructure that the installation program provisions, you must manage and maintain the cluster resources yourself.

You can also install {product-title} on a single node, which is a specialized installation method that is ideal for edge computing environments.

<<<<<<< HEAD
* **xref:../../installing/installing_aws/ipi/installing-aws-customizations.adoc#installing-aws-customizations[Installing a customized cluster on AWS]**: You can install a customized cluster on AWS infrastructure that the installation program provisions. The installation program allows for some customization to be applied at the installation stage. Many other customization options are available xref:../../post_installation_configuration/cluster-tasks.adoc#post-install-cluster-tasks[post-installation].

* **xref:../../installing/installing_aws/ipi/installing-aws-network-customizations.adoc#installing-aws-network-customizations[Installing a cluster on AWS with network customizations]**: You can customize your {product-title} network configuration during installation, so that your cluster can coexist with your existing IP address allocations and adhere to your network requirements.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_aws/ipi/installing-aws-vpc.adoc#installing-aws-vpc[Installing a cluster on an existing Virtual Private Cloud]**: You can install {product-title} on an existing AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). You can use this installation method if you have constraints set by the guidelines of your company, such as limits when creating new accounts or infrastructure.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_aws/ipi/installing-aws-private.adoc#installing-aws-private[Installing a private cluster on an existing VPC]**: You can install a private cluster on an existing AWS VPC. You can use this method to deploy {product-title} on an internal network that is not visible to the internet.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_aws/ipi/installing-aws-government-region.adoc#installing-aws-government-region[Installing a cluster on AWS into a government or secret region]**: {product-title} can be deployed into AWS regions that are specifically designed for US government agencies at the federal, state, and local level, as well as contractors, educational institutions, and other US customers that must run sensitive workloads in the cloud.

== Installing a cluster on user-provisioned infrastructure

You can install a cluster on AWS infrastructure that you provision, by using one of the following methods:

* **xref:../../installing/installing_aws/upi/installing-aws-user-infra.adoc#installing-aws-user-infra[Installing a cluster on AWS infrastructure that you provide]**: You can install {product-title} on AWS infrastructure that you provide. You can use the provided CloudFormation templates to create stacks of AWS resources that represent each of the components required for an {product-title} installation.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_aws/upi/installing-restricted-networks-aws.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-aws[Installing a cluster on AWS in a restricted network with user-provisioned infrastructure]**: You can install {product-title} on AWS infrastructure that you provide by using an internal mirror of the installation release content. You can use this method to install a cluster that does not require an active internet connection to obtain the software components. You can also use this installation method to ensure that your clusters only use container images that satisfy your organizational controls on external content. While you can install {product-title} by using the mirrored content, your cluster still requires internet access to use the AWS APIs.

[id="choosing-an-method-to-install-ocp-on-aws-single-node"]
== Installing a cluster on a single node

Installing {product-title} on a single node alleviates some of the requirements for high availability and large scale clusters. However, you must address the xref:../../installing/installing_sno/install-sno-preparing-to-install-sno.adoc#install-sno-requirements-for-installing-on-a-single-node_install-sno-preparing[requirements for installing on a single node], and the xref:../../installing/installing_sno/install-sno-installing-sno.adoc#additional-requirements-for-installing-sno-on-a-cloud-provider_install-sno-installing-sno-with-the-assisted-installer[additional requirements for installing {sno} on a cloud provider]. After addressing the requirements for single node installation, use the xref:../../installing/installing_aws/ipi/installing-aws-customizations.adoc#installing-aws-customizations[Installing a customized cluster on AWS] procedure to install the cluster. The xref:../../installing/installing_sno/install-sno-installing-sno.adoc#install-sno-installing-sno-manually[installing single-node OpenShift manually] section contains an exemplary `install-config.yaml` file when installing an {product-title} cluster on a single node.
