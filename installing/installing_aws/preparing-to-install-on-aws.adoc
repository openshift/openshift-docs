You can install {product-title} on {aws-full} using installer-provisioned, user-provisioned infrastructure, or on a single node, depending on the needs of your use case.

The default installation type uses installer-provisioned infrastructure, where the installation program provisions the underlying infrastructure for the cluster.

You can also install {product-title} on infrastructure that you provision. If you do not use infrastructure that the installation program provisions, you must manage and maintain the cluster resources yourself.

You can also install {product-title} on a single node, which is a specialized installation method that is ideal for edge computing environments.
