In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) in a restricted network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content on an existing Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

[id="prerequisites_installing-restricted-networks-aws-installer-provisioned"]
== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:../../installing/installing-mirroring-installation-images.adoc#installation-about-mirror-registry_installing-mirroring-installation-images[mirrored the images for a disconnected installation] to your registry and obtained the `imageContentSources` data and installation media for your version of {product-title}.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the installation media is on the mirror registry host, you can use that computer to complete all installation steps.
====
* You have an existing VPC in AWS. When installing to a restricted network using installer-provisioned infrastructure, you cannot use the installer-provisioned VPC. You must use a user-provisioned VPC that satisfies one of the following requirements:
** Contains the mirror registry
** Has firewall rules or a peering connection to access the mirror registry hosted elsewhere
* You xref:../../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.adoc#installing-aws-account[configured an AWS account] to host the cluster.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have an AWS profile stored on your computer, it must not use a temporary session token that you generated while using a multi-factor authentication device. The cluster continues to use your current AWS credentials to create AWS resources for the entire life of the cluster, so you must use key-based, long-lived credentials. To generate appropriate keys, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html[Managing Access Keys for IAM Users] in the AWS documentation. You can supply the keys when you run the installation program.
====
* You downloaded the AWS CLI and installed it on your computer. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-bundle.html[Install the AWS CLI Using the Bundled Installer (Linux, macOS, or Unix)] in the AWS documentation.
* If you use a firewall and plan to use the Telemetry service, you xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured the firewall to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are configuring a proxy, be sure to also review this site list.
====
* If the cloud identity and access management (IAM) APIs are not accessible in your environment, or if you do not want to store an administrator-level credential secret in the `kube-system` namespace, you can xref:../../installing/installing_aws/manually-creating-iam.adoc#manually-creating-iam-aws[manually create and maintain IAM credentials].
