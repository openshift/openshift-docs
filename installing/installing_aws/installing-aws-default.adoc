In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on
Amazon Web Services (AWS) that uses the default configuration options.

.Prerequisites

* Review details about the
xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update]
processes.
* xref:../../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.adoc#installing-aws-account[Configure an AWS account]
to host the cluster.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have an AWS profile stored on your computer, it must not use a temporary
session token that you generated while using a multi-factor authentication
device. The cluster continues to use your current AWS credentials to
create AWS resources for the entire life of the cluster, so you must
use key-based, long-lived credentials. To generate appropriate keys, see
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html[Managing Access Keys for IAM Users]
in the AWS documentation. You can supply the keys when you run the installation
program.
====
* If you use a firewall, you must
xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configure it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
