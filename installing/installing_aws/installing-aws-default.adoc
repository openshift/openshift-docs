In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on
Amazon Web Services (AWS) that uses the default configuration options.

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:../../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.adoc#installing-aws-account[configured an AWS account] to host the cluster.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have an AWS profile stored on your computer, it must not use a temporary session token that you generated while using a multi-factor authentication device. The cluster continues to use your current AWS credentials to create AWS resources for the entire life of the cluster, so you must use key-based, long-lived credentials. To generate appropriate keys, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html[Managing Access Keys for IAM Users] in the AWS documentation. You can supply the keys when you run the installation program.
====
* If you use a firewall, you xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
* If the cloud identity and access management (IAM) APIs are not accessible in your environment, or if you do not want to store an administrator-level credential secret in the `kube-system` namespace, you can xref:../../installing/installing_aws/manually-creating-iam.adoc#manually-creating-iam-aws[manually create and maintain IAM credentials]. Manual mode can also be used in environments where the cloud IAM APIs are not reachable.
