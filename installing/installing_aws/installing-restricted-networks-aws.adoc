= Installing a cluster on AWS that uses mirrored installation content
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: installing-restricted-networks-aws

toc::[]

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a
cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using infrastructure that you provide and
an internal mirror of the installation release content.

[IMPORTANT]
====
While you can install an {product-title} cluster by using mirrored installation
release content, your cluster still requires internet access to use the AWS APIs.
====

One way to create this infrastructure is to use the provided
CloudFormation templates. You can modify the templates to customize your
infrastructure or use the information that they contain to create AWS objects
according to your company's policies.

.Prerequisites

* xref:../../installing/install_config/installing-restricted-networks-preparations.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-preparations[Create a mirror registry on your bastion host]
 and obtain the `imageContentSources` data for your version of {product-title}.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the installation media is on the bastion host, use that computer
to complete all installation steps.
====
* Review details about the
xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update]
processes.
* xref:../../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.adoc#installing-aws-account[Configure an AWS account]
to host the cluster.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have an AWS profile stored on your computer, it must not use a temporary
session token that you generated while using a multi-factor authentication
device. The cluster continues to use your current AWS credentials to
create AWS resources for the entire life of the cluster, so you must
use key-based, long-lived credentials. To generate appropriate keys, see
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html[Managing Access Keys for IAM Users]
in the AWS documentation. You can supply the keys when you run the installation
program.
====
* Download the AWS CLI and install it on your computer. See
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-bundle.html[Install the AWS CLI Using the Bundled Installer (Linux, macOS, or Unix)]
in the AWS documentation.
* If you use a firewall and plan to use telemetry, you must
xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configure the firewall to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
+
[NOTE]
====
Be sure to also review this site list if you are configuring a proxy.

== Creating worker nodes

You can either manually create worker nodes or use a MachineSet to create worker
nodes after the cluster deploys. If you use a MachineSet to create and maintain
the workers, you can allow the cluster to manage them. This allows you to easily
scale, manage, and upgrade your workers.
