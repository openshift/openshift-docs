= Installing a cluster on AWS in a restricted network with user-provisioned infrastructure
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: installing-restricted-networks-aws

toc::[]

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a
cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using infrastructure that you provide and
an internal mirror of the installation release content.

[IMPORTANT]
====
While you can install an {product-title} cluster by using mirrored installation
release content, your cluster still requires Internet access to use the AWS APIs.
====

One way to create this infrastructure is to use the provided
CloudFormation templates. You can modify the templates to customize your
infrastructure or use the information that they contain to create AWS objects
according to your company's policies.

== Prerequisites

* You xref:../../installing/install_config/installing-restricted-networks-preparations.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-preparations[created a mirror registry on your mirror host]
 and obtained the `imageContentSources` data for your version of {product-title}.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the installation media is on the mirror host, you can use that computer
to complete all installation steps.
====
* You reviewed details about the
xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update]
processes.
* You xref:../../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.adoc#installing-aws-account[configured an AWS account]
to host the cluster.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have an AWS profile stored on your computer, it must not use a temporary session token that you generated while using a multi-factor authentication device. The cluster continues to use your current AWS credentials to create AWS resources for the entire life of the cluster, so you must use key-based, long-lived credentials. To generate appropriate keys, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html[Managing Access Keys for IAM Users] in the AWS documentation. You can supply the keys when you run the installation program.
====
* You downloaded the AWS CLI and installed it on your computer. See
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-bundle.html[Install the AWS CLI Using the Bundled Installer (Linux, macOS, or Unix)]
in the AWS documentation.
* If you use a firewall and plan to use the Telemetry service, you xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured the firewall to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
+
[NOTE]
====
Be sure to also review this site list if you are configuring a proxy.
====
* If you do not allow the system to manage identity and access management (IAM), then a cluster administrator can xref:../../installing/installing_aws/manually-creating-iam.adoc#manually-creating-iam-aws[manually create and maintain IAM credentials]. Manual mode can also be used in environments where the cloud IAM APIs are not reachable.

== Creating worker nodes

You can either manually create worker nodes or use a MachineSet to create worker nodes after the cluster deploys. If you use a MachineSet to create and maintain the workers, you can allow the cluster to manage them. This allows you to easily scale, manage, and upgrade your workers.
