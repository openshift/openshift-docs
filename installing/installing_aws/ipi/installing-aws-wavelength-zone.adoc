= Installing a cluster on AWS with compute nodes on AWS Wavelength Zones

toc::[]

You can quickly install an {product-title} cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) {zone-type} by setting the zone names in the edge compute pool of the `install-config.yaml` file, or install a cluster in an existing Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with Wavelength Zone subnets.

AWS {zone-type} is an infrastructure that AWS configured for mobile edge computing (MEC) applications.

A Wavelength Zone embeds AWS compute and storage services within the 5G network of a communication service provider (CSP). By placing application servers in a Wavelength Zone, the application traffic from your 5G devices can stay in the 5G network. The application traffic of the device reaches the target server directly, making latency a non-issue.

== Installing a cluster in an existing VPC that has Wavelength Zone subnets

You can install a cluster into an existing Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The installation program provisions the rest of the required infrastructure, which you can further customize. To customize the installation, modify parameters in the `install-config.yaml` file before you install the cluster.

Installing a cluster on AWS into an existing VPC requires extending compute nodes to the edge of the Cloud Infrastructure by using AWS {zone-type}.

You can use a provided CloudFormation template to create network resources. Additionally, you can modify a template to customize your infrastructure or use the information that they contain to create AWS resources according to your company's policies.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The steps for performing an installer-provisioned infrastructure installation are provided for example purposes only. Installing a cluster in an existing VPC requires that you have knowledge of the cloud provider and the installation process of {product-title}. You can use a CloudFormation template to assist you with completing these steps or to help model your own cluster installation. Instead of using the CloudFormation template to create resources, you can decide to use other methods for generating these resources.
