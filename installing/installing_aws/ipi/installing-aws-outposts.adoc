In {product-title} version 4.14, you could install a cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with compute nodes running in AWS Outposts as a Technology Preview. As of {product-title} version 4.15, this installation method is no longer supported.

Instead, you can xref:../../../installing/installing_aws/ipi/installing-aws-vpc.adoc#installing-aws-vpc[install a cluster on AWS into an existing VPC] and provision compute nodes on AWS Outposts as a postinstallation configuration task.
