= Installing a cluster on AWS with network customizations

:context: installing-aws-network-customizations

toc::[]

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on
Amazon Web Services (AWS) with customized network configuration options. By
customizing your network configuration, your cluster can coexist with existing
IP address allocations in your environment and integrate with existing MTU and
VXLAN configurations.

You must set most of the network configuration parameters during installation,
and you can modify only `kubeProxy` configuration parameters in a running
cluster.

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../../installing/overview/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:../../../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.adoc#installing-aws-account[configured an AWS account] to host the cluster.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have an AWS profile stored on your computer, it must not use a temporary session token that you generated while using a multi-factor authentication device. The cluster continues to use your current AWS credentials to create AWS resources for the entire life of the cluster, so you must use key-based, long-term credentials. To generate appropriate keys, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html[Managing Access Keys for IAM Users] in the AWS documentation. You can supply the keys when you run the installation program.
====
* If you use a firewall, you xref:../../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.

== Alternatives to storing administrator-level secrets in the kube-system project

By default, administrator secrets are stored in the `kube-system` project. If you configured the `credentialsMode` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` file to `Manual`, you must use one of the following alternatives:

* To manage long-term cloud credentials manually, follow the procedure in xref:../../../installing/installing_aws/ipi/installing-aws-network-customizations.adoc#manually-create-iam_installing-aws-network-customizations[Manually creating long-term credentials].

* To implement short-term credentials that are managed outside the cluster for individual components, follow the procedures in xref:../../../installing/installing_aws/ipi/installing-aws-network-customizations.adoc#installing-aws-with-short-term-creds_installing-aws-network-customizations[Configuring an AWS cluster to use short-term credentials].

=== Configuring an AWS cluster to use short-term credentials

To install a cluster that is configured to use the AWS Security Token Service (STS), you must configure the CCO utility and create the required AWS resources for your cluster.

include::modules/cco-ccoctl-configuring.adoc[leveloffset=+3]

//Task part 2: Creating the required AWS resources
[id="sts-mode-create-aws-resources-ccoctl_{context}"]
==== Creating AWS resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

You have the following options when creating AWS resources:

* You can use the `ccoctl aws create-all` command to create the AWS resources automatically. This is the quickest way to create the resources. See xref:../../../installing/installing_aws/ipi/installing-aws-network-customizations.adoc#cco-ccoctl-creating-at-once_installing-aws-network-customizations[Creating AWS resources with a single command].

* If you need to review the JSON files that the `ccoctl` tool creates before modifying AWS resources, or if the process the `ccoctl` tool uses to create AWS resources automatically does not meet the requirements of your organization, you can create the AWS resources individually. See xref:../../../installing/installing_aws/ipi/installing-aws-network-customizations.adoc#cco-ccoctl-creating-individually_installing-aws-network-customizations[Creating AWS resources individually].
