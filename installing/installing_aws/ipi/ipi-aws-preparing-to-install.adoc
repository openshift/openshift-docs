To install an {product-title} cluster on {aws-first}, you must verify your internet connectivity, download the installation program, install the {oc-first}, and generate an SSH key pair.

If required, you also need to manually create long-term credentials for {aws-short} or configure an {aws-short} cluster to use short-term credentials with Amazon Web Services Security Token Service ({aws-short} STS).

The following list outlines in detail the steps to prepare to install an {product-title} cluster on {aws-short}:

* Verifying internet connectivity for your cluster.

* xref:../../../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.adoc#installing-aws-account[Configuring an {aws-short} account].

* Downloading the installation program.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are installing in a disconnected environment, you extract the installation program from the mirrored content. For more information, see xref:../../../installing/disconnected_install/installing-mirroring-installation-images.adoc#installing-mirroring-installation-images[Mirroring images for a disconnected installation].
====
* Installing the {oc-first}.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are installing in a disconnected environment, install `oc` to the mirror host.
====
* Generating an SSH key pair. You can use this key pair to authenticate into the {product-title} cluster's nodes after it is deployed.

* If the cloud identity and access management (IAM) APIs are not accessible in your environment, or if you do not want to store an administrator-level credential secret in the `kube-system` namespace, xref:../../../installing/installing_aws/ipi/installing-aws-customizations.adoc#manually-create-iam_installing-aws-customizations[manually creating long-term credentials for {aws-short}] or xref:../../../installing/installing_aws/ipi/installing-aws-customizations.adoc#installing-aws-with-short-term-creds_installing-aws-customizations[configuring an {aws-short} cluster to use short-term credentials] with ({aws-short} STS).
