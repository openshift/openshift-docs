toc::[]

You can quickly install an {product-title} cluster in Amazon Web Services (AWS) Local Zones by setting the zone names in the edge compute pool of the `install-config.yaml` file, or install a cluster in an existing VPC that lists Local Zone subnets.

AWS Local Zones are a type of infrastructure that place Cloud Resources close to metropolitan regions. For more information, see the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-local-zones[AWS Local Zones Documentation].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The steps for performing an installer-provisioned infrastructure installation are provided for example purposes only. Installing a cluster in an existing VPC requires that you have knowledge of the cloud provider and the installation process of {product-title}. You can use a CloudFormation template to assist you with completing these steps or to help model your own cluster installation. Instead of using the CloudFormation template to create resources, you can decide to use other methods for generating these resources.
====

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:../../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.adoc#installing-aws-account[configured an AWS account] to host the cluster.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have an AWS profile stored on your computer, it must not use a temporary session token that you generated while using a multi-factor authentication device. The cluster continues to use your current AWS credentials to create AWS resources for the entire life of the cluster, so you must use key-based, long-term credentials. To generate appropriate keys, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html[Managing Access Keys for IAM Users] in the AWS documentation. You can supply the keys when you run the installation program.
====
* You noted the region and supported link:https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/locations[AWS Local Zones locations] to create the network resources in.
* You read the link:https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/features/[Features] for each AWS Local Zones location.
* You downloaded the AWS CLI and installed it on your computer. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-bundle.html[Install the AWS CLI Using the Bundled Installer (Linux, macOS, or UNIX)] in the AWS documentation.
* If you use a firewall, you xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
+
[NOTE]
====
Be sure to also review this site list if you are configuring a proxy.
====
* Add permission for the user who creates the cluster to modify the Local Zone group with `ec2:ModifyAvailabilityZoneGroup`. For example:

== Optional: Configuring an AWS cluster to use short-term credentials

To install a cluster that is configured to use the AWS Security Token Service (STS), you must configure the CCO utility and create the required AWS resources for your cluster.

[NOTE]
====
To use the AWS STS, you must configure the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) to run in manual mode. As part of the installation process, you set `credentialsMode` parameter to `Manual` after creating the `install-config.yaml` installation configuration file.

=== Creating AWS resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

You have the following options when creating AWS resources:

* You can use the `ccoctl aws create-all` command to create the AWS resources automatically. This is the quickest way to create the resources. See xref:../../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-localzone.adoc#cco-ccoctl-creating-at-once_installing-aws-localzone[Creating AWS resources with a single command].

* If you need to review the JSON files that the `ccoctl` tool creates before modifying AWS resources, or if the process the `ccoctl` tool uses to create AWS resources automatically does not meet the requirements of your organization, you can create the AWS resources individually. See xref:../../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-localzone.adoc#cco-ccoctl-creating-individually_installing-aws-localzone[Creating AWS resources individually].

== Installing a cluster in an existing VPC that has Local Zone subnets

You can install a cluster into an existing Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The installation program provisions the rest of the required infrastructure, which you can further customize. To customize the installation, modify parameters in the `install-config.yaml` file before you install the cluster.

Installing a cluster on AWS into an existing VPC requires extending workers to the edge of the Cloud Infrastructure by using AWS Local Zones.

Local Zone subnets extend regular workers' nodes to edge networks. Each edge worker nodes runs a user workload. After you create an Amazon Web Service (AWS) Local Zone environment, and you deploy your cluster, you can use edge worker nodes to create user workloads in Local Zone subnets.

You can use a provided CloudFormation template to create the VPC and public subnets. Additionally, you can modify a template to customize your infrastructure or use the information that they contain to create AWS objects according to your company's policies.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to create private subnets, you must either modify the provided CloudFormation template or create your own template.

== Alternatives to storing administrator-level secrets in the kube-system project

By default, administrator secrets are stored in the `kube-system` project. If you configured the `credentialsMode` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` file to `Manual`, you must use one of the following alternatives:

* If you configured the CCO utility (`ccoctl`) to implement short-term credentials for individual components, follow the procedure in xref:../../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-localzone.adoc#cco-ccoctl-install-creating-manifests_installing-aws-localzone[Incorporating the Cloud Credential Operator utility manifests].

* If you will manage cloud credentials manually, follow the procedure in xref:../../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-localzone.adoc#manually-create-iam_installing-aws-localzone[Manually creating long-term credentials].
