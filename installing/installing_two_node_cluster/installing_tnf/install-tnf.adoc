You can deploy a two-node OpenShift cluster with fencing by using either the installer-provisioned infrastructure or the user-provisioned infrastructure installation method. The following examples provide sample `install-config.yaml` configurations for both methods.

[NOTE]
====
Do an etcd backup before proceeding to ensure that you can restore the cluster if any issues occur.
