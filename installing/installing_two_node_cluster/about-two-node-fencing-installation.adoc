:FeatureName: Two-node OpenShift cluster with fencing
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

A two-node OpenShift cluster with fencing provides high availability (HA) with a reduced hardware footprint. This configuration is designed for distributed or edge environments where deploying a full three-node control plane cluster is not practical.

A two-node cluster does not include compute nodes. The two control plane machines run user workloads in addition to managing the cluster.

Fencing is managed by Pacemaker, which can isolate an unresponsive node by using the nodeâ€™s baseboard management controller (BMC). After the unresponsive node is fenced, the remaining node can safely continue recovery without the risk of resource corruption.

For information about installing a two-node OpenShift cluster with fencing, see TBD. 
// xref will be added after merging the TNF PR.
