= Two-Node with Arbiter
:context: about-two-node-arbiter-installation

A Two-Node OpenShift with Arbiter (TNA) cluster is a compact, cost-effective {product-title} topology. The topology consists of two control plane nodes and a lightweight arbiter node. The arbiter node stores the full etcd data, maintaining an etcd quorum and preventing split brain. The arbiter node does not run the additional control plane components `kube-apiserver` and `kube-controller-manager`, nor does it run workloads.

To install a Two-Node OpenShift with Arbiter cluster, assign an arbiter role to at least one of the nodes and set the control plane node count for the cluster to 2. Although {product-title} does not currently impose a limit on the number of arbiter nodes, the typical deployment includes only one to minimize the use of hardware resources.

After installation, you can add additional arbiter nodes to a Two-Node OpenShift with Arbiter cluster but not to a standard multi-node cluster. It is also not possible to convert between a Two-Node OpenShift with Arbiter and standard topology.

You can install a Two-Node Arbiter cluster by using one of the following methods:

* Installing on bare metal: xref:../installing_bare_metal/ipi/ipi-install-installation-workflow.adoc#ipi-install-config-local-arbiter-node_ipi-install-installation-workflow[Configuring a local arbiter node]

* Installing with the Agent-based Installer: xref:../../installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/installing-with-agent-based-installer.adoc#installing-ocp-agent-local-arbiter-node_installing-with-agent-based-installer[Configuring a local arbiter node]
