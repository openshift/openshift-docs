You can customize and install a cluster on {rh-virtualization-first}. The installation program uses installer-provisioned infrastructure to automate creating and deploying the cluster.

To install a customized cluster, you prepare the environment and perform the following steps:

. Create an installation configuration file, the `install-config.yaml` file, by running the installation program and answering its prompts.
. Inspect and modify parameters in the `install-config.yaml` file.
. Make a working copy of the `install-config.yaml` file.
. Run the installation program with a copy of the `install-config.yaml` file.

Then, the installation program creates the {product-title} cluster.

For an alternative to installing a customized cluster, see xref:../../installing/installing_rhv/installing-rhv-default.adoc#installing-rhv-default[Installing a default cluster].

[NOTE]
====
This installation program is available for Linux and macOS only.

.Prerequisites

* Review details about the
xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update]
processes.
* If you use a firewall,
xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configure it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
* xref:../../installing/installing_rhv/installing-rhv-creating-custom-vm.adoc#installing-rhv-creating-custom-vm[Create a custom virtual machine template on {rh-virtualization}].

// The RHV installer for 4.4 GA has not been implemented or tested support for most configuration parameters. This will be fixed in an upcoming z-stream. When that happens, (1) uncomment the following line, (2) update the contents of the included file to display RHV-supported parameters, and (3) remove this comment.

.Troubleshooting
If the installation fails, the installation program times out and displays an error message. To learn more, see

== Post-installation tasks
After the {product-title} cluster initializes, you can perform the following tasks.

* Optional: After deployment, add or replace SSH keys using the Machine Config Operator (MCO) in {product-title}.
* Optional: Remove the `kubeadmin` user. Instead, use the authentication provider to create a user with cluster-admin privileges.
