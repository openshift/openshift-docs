toc::[]

This topic shows you how to install a default, non-customized, {product-title} cluster on {rh-virtualization-first}.

When you run the installer and finish answering the interactive prompts, the installer creates the {product-title} cluster.

NOTE: Instead of installing a default cluster, you can link:XREF TBD[install a customized cluster]. You can also use this alternative workflow to troubleshoot some installation issues or create templates for multiple installations.

.Prerequisites

You have completed the steps in xref:../../installing-rhv-preparing-to-install.adoc[], including:
* Preparing your {rh-virtualization} and network environments
* Setting up the installer software, SSH keys, and CA certificates.

.Procedure

== Starting the installer

. On the installer machine, go to the directory that has the installer and run it.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo ./openshift-install create cluster --dir=<assets-dir> <1>
----
<1> For `<assets-dir>`, specify a new directory name for the installer to create and save files.

NOTE: You have finished installing the {product-title} cluster on {rh-virtualization}.

.Troubleshooting
If something goes wrong with the installation, the installer times out and displays an error message. To learn more, see xref:../../installing-rhv-troubleshooting.adoc[Troubleshooting Installation Problems].
