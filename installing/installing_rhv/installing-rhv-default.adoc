[WARNING]
====
Due to a known issue, this default installation procedure does not work with {product-title} versions 4.4 and 4.5 on {rh-virtualization-first} 4.4.1.  This defect is fixed in {rh-virtualization} 4.4.2.

Instead, follow the steps in link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/installing/installing_rhv/installing-rhv-customizations.html[Installing a cluster on {rh-virtualization} with customizations].
====

[WARNING]
====
Installing {product-title} version 4.6 on {rh-virtualization-first} requires {rh-virtualization} version 4.4. If you are running an earlier version of {product-title} on {rh-virtualization} 4.3, do not update it to {product-title} version 4.6. Red Hat has not tested running {product-title} version 4.6 on {rh-virtualization} version 4.3 and does not support this combination. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4763741[{product-title} 4.x Tested Integrations (for x86_x64)].
====
You can quickly install a default, non-customized, {product-title} cluster on a {rh-virtualization-first} cluster, similar to the one shown in the following diagram.

The installation program uses installer-provisioned infrastructure to automate creating and deploying the cluster.

To install a default cluster, you prepare the environment, run the installation program and answer its prompts. Then, the installation program creates the {product-title} cluster.

For an alternative to installing a default cluster, see xref:../../installing/installing_rhv/installing-rhv-customizations.adoc#installing-rhv-customizations[Installing a cluster with customizations].

[NOTE]
====
This installation program is available for Linux and macOS only.

== Prerequisites

* Review details about the
xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update]
processes.
* If you use a firewall,
xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configure it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.

== Post-installation tasks
After the {product-title} cluster initializes, you can perform the following tasks.

* Optional: After deployment, add or replace SSH keys using the Machine Config Operator (MCO) in {product-title}.
* Optional: Remove the `kubeadmin` user. Instead, use the authentication provider to create a user with cluster-admin privileges.
