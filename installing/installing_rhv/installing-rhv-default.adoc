[WARNING]
====
Due to a known issue, this default installation procedure does not work with {product-title} versions 4.4 and 4.5 on {rh-virtualization-first} 4.4.1.  This defect is fixed in {rh-virtualization} 4.4.2.

Instead, follow the steps in link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/installing/installing_rhv/installing-rhv-customizations.html[Installing a cluster on RHV with customizations].

During that procedure, customize `install-config.yaml` as described in link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5374251[OpenShift IPI installation on RHV-4.x failed with "Error: timeout while waiting for state to become 'up' (last state: 'down', timeout: 10m0s)"].
====

You can quickly install a default, non-customized, {product-title} cluster on a {rh-virtualization-first} cluster, similar to the one shown in the following diagram.

image::92_OpenShift_Cluster_Install_RHV_0520.png[Diagram of an {product-title} cluster on a {rh-virtualization} cluster]

The installation program uses installer-provisioned infrastructure to automate creating and deploying the cluster.

To install a default cluster, you prepare the environment, run the installation program and answer its prompts. Then, the installation program creates the {product-title} cluster.

For an alternative to installing a default cluster, see xref:../../installing/installing_rhv/installing-rhv-customizations.adoc#installing-rhv-customizations[Installing a cluster with customizations].

[NOTE]
====
This installation program is available for Linux and macOS only.

== Prerequisites

* Review details about the
xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update]
processes.
* If you use a firewall,
xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configure it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.

.Troubleshooting
If the installation fails, the installation program times out and displays an error message. To learn more, see

== Post-installation tasks
After the {product-title} cluster initializes, you can perform the following tasks.

* Optional: After deployment, add or replace SSH keys using the Machine Config Operator (MCO) in {product-title}.
* Optional: Remove the `kubeadmin` user. Instead, use the authentication provider to create a user with cluster-admin privileges.
