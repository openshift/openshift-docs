== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You have a supported combination of versions in the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/5485861[Support Matrix for {product-title} on {rh-virtualization-first}].
* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].

== Choosing a method to install {product-title} on RHV

You can install {product-title} on installer-provisioned or user-provisioned infrastructure. The default installation type uses installer-provisioned infrastructure, where the installation program provisions the underlying infrastructure for the cluster. You can also install {product-title} on infrastructure that you provision. If you do not use infrastructure that the installation program provisions, you must manage and maintain the cluster resources yourself.

See xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#installation-process_architecture-installation[Installation process] for more information about installer-provisioned and user-provisioned installation processes.

=== Installing a cluster on installer-provisioned infrastructure

You can install a cluster on {rh-virtualization-first} virtual machines that are provisioned by the {product-title} installation program, by using one of the following methods:

* **xref:../../installing/installing_rhv/installing-rhv-default.adoc#installing-rhv-default[Installing a cluster quickly on RHV]**: You can quickly install {product-title} on {rh-virtualization} virtual machines that the {product-title} installation program provisions.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_rhv/installing-rhv-customizations.adoc#installing-rhv-customizations[Installing a cluster on RHV with customizations]**: You can install a customized {product-title} cluster on installer-provisioned guests on {rh-virtualization}. The installation program allows for some customization to be applied at the installation stage. Many other customization options are available xref:../../post_installation_configuration/cluster-tasks.adoc#post-install-cluster-tasks[post-installation].

[id="choosing-an-method-to-install-ocp-on-rhv-user-provisioned"]
=== Installing a cluster on user-provisioned infrastructure

You can install a cluster on {rh-virtualization} virtual machines that you provision, by using one of the following methods:

* **xref:../../installing/installing_rhv/installing-rhv-user-infra.adoc#installing-rhv-user-infra[Installing a cluster on RHV with user-provisioned infrastructure]**: You can install {product-title} on {rh-virtualization} virtual machines that you provision. You can use the provided Ansible playbooks to assist with the installation.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_rhv/installing-rhv-restricted-network.adoc#installing-rhv-restricted-network[Installing a cluster on RHV in a restricted network]**: You can install {product-title} on {rh-virtualization} in a restricted or disconnected network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content. You can use this method to install a user-provisioned cluster that does not require an active internet connection to obtain the software components. You can also use this installation method to ensure that your clusters only use container images that satisfy your organizational controls on external content.
