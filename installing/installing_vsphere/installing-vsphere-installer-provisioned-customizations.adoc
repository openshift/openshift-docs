In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on your
VMware vSphere instance by using installer-provisioned infrastructure. To customize the installation, you modify parameters in the `install-config.yaml` file before you install the cluster.

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You provisioned xref:../../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage] for your cluster. To deploy a private image registry, your storage must provide `ReadWriteMany` access modes.
* The {product-title} installer requires access to port 443 on the vCenter and ESXi hosts. You verified that port 443 is accessible.
* If you use a firewall, you confirmed with the administrator that port 443 is accessible. Control plane nodes must be able to reach vCenter and ESXi hosts on port 443 for the installation to succeed.
* If you use a firewall, you xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.

== Creating registry storage
After you install the cluster, you must create storage for the registry Operator.
