= Installing a cluster on vSphere in a restricted network with user-provisioned infrastructure
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: installing-restricted-networks-vsphere

toc::[]

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on
VMware vSphere infrastructure that you provision in a restricted network.

:FeatureName: Support for multiple vCenters
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The steps for performing a user-provisioned infrastructure installation are provided as an example only. Installing a cluster with infrastructure you provide requires knowledge of the vSphere platform and the installation process of {product-title}. Use the user-provisioned infrastructure installation instructions as a guide; you are free to create the required resources through other methods.

[id="prerequisites_installing-restricted-networks-vsphere_{context}"]
== Prerequisites

* You have completed the tasks in xref:../../../installing/installing_vsphere/upi/upi-vsphere-preparing-to-install.adoc#upi-vsphere-preparing-to-install[Preparing to install a cluster using user-provisioned infrastructure].
* You reviewed your VMware platform licenses. Red{nbsp}Hat does not place any restrictions on your VMware licenses, but some VMware infrastructure components require licensing.
* You reviewed details about the xref:../../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../../installing/overview/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:../../../disconnected/mirroring/installing-mirroring-installation-images.adoc#installing-mirroring-installation-images[created a registry on your mirror host] and obtained the `imageContentSources` data for your version of {product-title}.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the installation media is on the mirror host, you can use that computer to complete all installation steps.
====
* You provisioned xref:../../../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage] for your cluster. To deploy a private image registry, your storage must provide
`ReadWriteMany` access modes.
* Completing the installation requires that you upload the {op-system-first} OVA on vSphere hosts. The machine from which you complete this process requires access to port 443 on the vCenter and ESXi hosts. You verified that port 443 is accessible.
* If you use a firewall, you confirmed with the administrator that port 443 is accessible. Control plane nodes must be able to reach vCenter and ESXi hosts on port 443 for the installation to succeed.
* If you use a firewall and plan to use the Telemetry service, you xref:../../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured the firewall to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
