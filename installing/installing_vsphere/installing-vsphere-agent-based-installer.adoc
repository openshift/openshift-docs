The Agent-based installation method provides the flexibility to boot your on-premises servers in any way that you choose. It combines the ease of use of the Assisted Installation service with the ability to run offline, including in air-gapped environments.

Agent-based installation is a subcommand of the {product-title} installer. It generates a bootable ISO image containing all of the information required to deploy an {product-title} cluster with an available release image.
