The Agent-based installation method provides the flexibility to boot your on-premise servers in any way that you choose. It combines the ease of use of the Assisted Installation service with the ability to run offline, including in air-gapped environments.

Agent-based installation is a subcommand of the {product-title} installer. It generates a bootable ISO image containing all of the information required to deploy an {product-title} cluster with an available release image.

For more information about installing a cluster using the Agent-based Installer, see xref:../../installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer.adoc#preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer[Preparing to install with the Agent-based Installer].

[IMPORTANT]

Your vSphere account must include privileges for reading and creating the resources required to install an {product-title} cluster.
For more information about privileges, see xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/upi/upi-vsphere-installation-reqs.adoc#installation-vsphere-installer-infra-requirements_upi-vsphere-installation-reqs[vCenter requirements].
