In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on your
VMware vSphere instance by using installer-provisioned infrastructure.

== Prerequisites

* Provision
xref:../../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage]
for your cluster. To deploy a private image registry, your storage must provide
ReadWriteMany access modes.
* Ensure that your vSphere server has only one datacenter and cluster. If it has multiple datacenters and clusters, it also has multiple default root resource pools, and the worker nodes will not provision during installation.
* Review details about the
xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update]
processes.
* If you use a firewall, you must
xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configure it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
