= Installing a cluster on vSphere with user-provisioned infrastructure

:context: installing-vsphere

toc::[]

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on
VMware vSphere infrastructure that you provision.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The steps for performing a user-provisioned infrastructure installation are provided as an example only. Installing a cluster with infrastructure you provide requires knowledge of the vSphere platform and the installation process of {product-title}. Use the user-provisioned infrastructure installation instructions as a guide; you are free to create the required resources through other methods.
====

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You provisioned xref:../../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage] for your cluster. To deploy a private image registry, your storage must provide `ReadWriteMany` access modes.
* Completing the installation requires that you upload the {op-system-first} OVA on vSphere hosts. The machine from which you complete this process requires access to port 443 on the vCenter and ESXi hosts. You verified that port 443 is accessible.
* If you use a firewall, you confirmed with the administrator that port 443 is accessible. Control plane nodes must be able to reach vCenter and ESXi hosts on port 443 for the installation to succeed.
* If you use a firewall, you xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
