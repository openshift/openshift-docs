In {product-title} {product-version}, you can install a cluster on VMware vSphere infrastructure in a restricted network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content.

[id="prerequisites_installing-restricted-networks-installer-provisioned-vsphere"]
== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:../../installing/installing-mirroring-installation-images.adoc#installing-mirroring-installation-images[created a registry on your mirror host] and obtained the `imageContentSources` data for your version of {product-title}.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the installation media is on the mirror registry host, you can use that computer to complete all installation steps.
====
* You provisioned xref:../../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage] for your cluster. To deploy a private image registry, your storage must provide the ReadWriteMany access mode.
* The {product-title} installer requires access to port 443 on the vCenter and ESXi hosts. You verified that port 443 is accessible.
* If you use a firewall, you confirmed with the administrator that port 443 is accessible. Control plane nodes must be able to reach vCenter and ESXi hosts on port 443 for the installation to succeed.
* If you use a firewall and plan to use the Telemetry service, you xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured the firewall to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.

[NOTE]
====
If you are configuring a proxy, be sure to also review this site list.

== Creating registry storage

After you install the cluster, you must create storage for the Registry Operator.
