After installing an {product-title} cluster on vSphere with the platform integration feature enabled, you may update the vSphere connection settings manually.

For installations using the Assisted Installer, you must update the connection settings. This is because the Assisted Installer adds default connection settings to the *vSphere connection configuration* wizard as placeholders.

For installer-provisioned or user-provisioned infrastructure installations, you should have entered valid connection settings during the installation. You may use the *vSphere connection configuration* wizard to validate or modify the connection settings, but this is not mandatory.
