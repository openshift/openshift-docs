== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.

* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].

* If you use a firewall and plan to use Telemetry, you
xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured the firewall to allow the sites] required by your cluster.

* You reviewed your VMware platform licenses. Red Hat does not place any restrictions on your VMware licenses, but some VMware infrastructure components require licensing.

== Choosing a method to install {product-title} on vSphere

You can install {product-title} with the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform/2022/html-single/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform/index[{ai-full}]. This method requires no setup for the installer, and is ideal for connected environments like vSphere. Installing with the {ai-full} also provides integration with vSphere, enabling autoscaling. See xref:../../installing/installing_on_prem_assisted/installing-on-prem-assisted.adoc#installing-on-prem-assisted[Installing an on-premise cluster using the {ai-full}] for additional details.

You can also install {product-title} on vSphere by using installer-provisioned or user-provisioned infrastructure. Installer-provisioned infrastructure is ideal for installing in environments with air-gapped/restricted networks, where the installation program provisions the underlying infrastructure for the cluster. You can also install {product-title} on infrastructure that you provide. If you do not use infrastructure that the installation program provisions, you must manage and maintain the cluster resources yourself.

See the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#installation-process_architecture-installation[Installation process] for more information about installer-provisioned and user-provisioned installation processes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The steps for performing a user-provisioned infrastructure installation are provided as an example only. Installing a cluster with infrastructure you provide requires knowledge of the vSphere platform and the installation process of {product-title}. Use the user-provisioned infrastructure installation instructions as a guide; you are free to create the required resources through other methods.

=== Installer-provisioned infrastructure installation of {product-title} on vSphere

Installer-provisioned infrastructure allows the installation program to preconfigure and automate the provisioning of resources required by {product-title}.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned.adoc#installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned[Installing a cluster on vSphere]**: You can install {product-title} on vSphere by using installer-provisioned infrastructure installation with no customization.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-customizations.adoc#installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-customizations[Installing a cluster on vSphere with customizations]**: You can install {product-title} on vSphere by using installer-provisioned infrastructure installation with the default customization options.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-network-customizations.adoc#installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-network-customizations[Installing a cluster on vSphere with network customizations]**: You can install {product-title} on installer-provisioned vSphere infrastructure, with network customizations. You can customize your {product-title} network configuration during installation, so that your cluster can coexist with your existing IP address allocations and adhere to your network requirements.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-restricted-networks-installer-provisioned-vsphere.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-installer-provisioned-vsphere[Installing a cluster on vSphere in a restricted network]**: You can install a cluster on VMware vSphere infrastructure in a restricted network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content.
 You can use this method to deploy {product-title} on an internal network that is not visible to the internet.

=== User-provisioned infrastructure installation of {product-title} on vSphere

User-provisioned infrastructure requires the user to provision all resources required by {product-title}.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere.adoc#[Installing a cluster on vSphere with user-provisioned infrastructure]**: You can install {product-title} on VMware vSphere infrastructure that you provision.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere-network-customizations.adoc#installing-vsphere-network-customizations[Installing a cluster on vSphere with network customizations with user-provisioned infrastructure]**: You can install {product-title} on VMware vSphere infrastructure that you provision with customized network configuration options.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-restricted-networks-vsphere.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-vsphere[Installing a cluster on vSphere in a restricted network with user-provisioned infrastructure]**: {product-title} can be installed on VMware vSphere infrastructure that you provision in a restricted network.

== Configuring the vSphere connection settings

* **xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere-post-installation-configuration.adoc#installing-vsphere-post-installation-configuration[Updating the vSphere connection settings following an installation]**: For installations on vSphere using the Assisted Installer, you must manually update the vSphere connection settings to complete the installation. For installer-provisioned or user-provisioned infrastructure installations on vSphere, you can optionally validate or modify the vSphere connection settings at any time.

== Uninstalling an installer-provisioned infrastructure installation of {product-title} on vSphere

* **xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/uninstalling-cluster-vsphere-installer-provisioned.adoc#uninstalling-cluster-vsphere-installer-provisioned[Uninstalling a cluster on vSphere that uses installer-provisioned infrastructure]**: You can remove a cluster that you deployed on VMware vSphere infrastructure that used installer-provisioned infrastructure.
