Installer-provisioned installation provides support for installing {product-title} on bare metal nodes. This guide provides a methodology to achieving a successful installation.

During installer-provisioned installation on bare metal, the installer on the bare metal node labeled as `provisioner` creates a bootstrap virtual machine (VM). The role of the bootstrap VM is to assist in the process of deploying an {product-title} cluster. The bootstrap VM connects to the `baremetal` network and to the `provisioning` network, if present, via the network bridges.

When the installation of OpenShift control plane nodes is complete and fully operational, the installer destroys the bootstrap VM automatically and moves the virtual IP addresses (VIPs) to the control plane nodes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `provisioning` network is optional, but it is required for PXE booting. If you deploy without a `provisioning` network, you must use a virtual media BMC addressing option such as `redfish-virtualmedia` or `idrac-virtualmedia`.
