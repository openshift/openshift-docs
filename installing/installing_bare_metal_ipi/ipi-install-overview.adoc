Installer Provisioned Infrastructure (IPI) installation provides support for installing {product-title} on bare metal nodes. This guide provides a methodology to achieving a successful installation.

The bare metal node labeled as `provisioner` contains two network bridges: `provisioning` and `baremetal`, each one connected to a different network. During installation of IPI on bare metal, the installer creates a bootstrap VM and connects it to both the `provisioning` and `baremetal` network via those bridges. The role of the bootstrap VM is to assist in the process of deploying an {product-title} cluster.

When the installation of OpenShift control plane nodes, or master nodes, is complete and fully operational, the installer destroys the bootstrap VM automatically and moves the virtual IP addresses (VIPs) to the appropriate nodes accordingly. The API VIP moves to the Control Plane nodes and the Ingress VIP moves to the worker nodes.
