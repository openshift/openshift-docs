Installer-provisioned installation on bare metal nodes deploys and configures the infrastructure that a {product-title} cluster runs on. This guide provides a methodology to achieving a successful installer-provisioned bare-metal installation. The following diagram illustrates the installation environment in phase 1 of deployment:

For the installation, the key elements in the previous diagram are:

- **Provisioner**: A physical machine that runs the installation program and hosts the bootstrap VM that deploys the controller of a new {product-title} cluster.
- **Bootstrap VM**: A virtual machine used in the process of deploying an {product-title} cluster.
- **Network bridges**: The bootstrap VM connects to the bare metal network and to the provisioning network, if present, via network bridges, `eno1` and `eno2`.

In phase 2 of the deployment, the provisioner destroys the bootstrap VM automatically and moves the virtual IP addresses (VIPs) to the appropriate nodes. The API VIP moves to the control plane nodes and the Ingress VIP moves to the worker nodes.

The following diagram illustrates phase 2 of deployment:

After this point, the node used by the provisioner can be removed or repurposed. From here, all additional provisioning tasks are carried out by controllers.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The provisioning network is optional, but it is required for PXE booting. If you deploy without a provisioning network, you must use a virtual media baseboard management controller (BMC) addressing option such as `redfish-virtualmedia` or `idrac-virtualmedia`.
