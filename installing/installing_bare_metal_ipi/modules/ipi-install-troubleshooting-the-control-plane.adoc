= Troubleshooting the Control Plane

Once Ironic is available, the installer will provision three Control Plane nodes. For early failures, use IPMI to access the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) of each Control Plane node to see if it received any error reports. You may also use a proprietary solution such as iDRAC or ILO.

If commands like `oc get clusteroperators` show degraded operators when the cluster comes up and after the installer destroys the bootstrap VM, it may be useful to examine the logs of the pods within the `openshift-kni-infra` namespace.
