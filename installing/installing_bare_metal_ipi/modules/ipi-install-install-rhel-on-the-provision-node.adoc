= Install RHEL on the provision node

With the networking portions complete, the next step in installing the Red Hat OpenShift (OCP) cluster
is to install RHEL 8 on the provision node.
This node will be used as the orchestrator in installing the OCP cluster on the three master nodes and two worker nodes.

[NOTE]
====
For the purposes of this document, installing RHEL on the provision node is out of scope.
However, options include, but are not limited to, using a RHEL Satellite server, PXE, or installation media.
