Installer Provisioned Infrastructure (IPI) installation provides support for installing {product-title} on bare metal nodes.
This guide provides a methodology to achieving a successful installation.

The bare metal node labeled as `provisioner` contains two network bridges: provisioning and baremetal,
each one connected to a different network.
During installation of IPI on baremetal, a bootstrap VM is created and connected to both the provisioning and
baremetal network via those bridges. The role of the VM is to assist in the process of deploying an {product-title} cluster.

When the installation of OpenShift control plane nodes, or master nodes, is complete and fully operational,
the bootstrap VM is destroyed automatically and the appropriate VIPs are moved accordingly.
The API and DNS VIPs move into the control plane nodes and the Ingress VIP services applications that
reside within the worker nodes.
