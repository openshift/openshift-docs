== Installing {sno} manually

To install {product-title} on a single node, first generate the installation ISO, and then boot the server from the ISO. You can monitor the installation using the `openshift-install` installation program.

== Installing {sno} with {ibm-z-reg} and {ibm-linux-one-reg}

Installing a single-node cluster on {ibm-z-reg} and {ibm-linux-one-reg} requires user-provisioned installation using either the "Installing a cluster with {op-system-base} KVM on {ibm-z-reg} and {ibm-linux-one-reg}" or the "Installing a cluster with z/VM on {ibm-z-reg} and {ibm-linux-one-reg}" procedure.

[NOTE]
====
Installing a single-node cluster on {ibm-z-reg} simplifies installation for development and test environments and requires less resource requirements at entry level.
====

[discrete]
=== Hardware requirements

* The equivalent of two Integrated Facilities for Linux (IFL), which are SMT2 enabled, for each cluster.
* At least one network connection to both connect to the `LoadBalancer` service and to serve data for traffic outside the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
You can use dedicated or shared IFLs to assign sufficient compute resources. Resource sharing is one of the key strengths of {ibm-z-reg}. However, you must adjust capacity correctly on each hypervisor layer and ensure sufficient resources for every {product-title} cluster.
