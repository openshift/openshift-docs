toc::[]

You can install {sno} by using either the web-based Assisted Installer or the `coreos-installer` tool to generate a discovery ISO image. The discovery ISO image writes the {op-system-first} system configuration to the target installation disk, so that you can run a single-cluster node to meet your needs.

Consider using {sno} when you want to run a cluster in a low-resource or an isolated environment for testing, troubleshooting, training, or small-scale project purposes.
