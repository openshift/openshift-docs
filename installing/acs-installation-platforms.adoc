1. The availability of support for each platform depends on the overarching lifecycle of the platform and the end-of-life date.
2. {rh-rhacscs-first} is supported as a self-managed add-on for managed OpenShift services that meet the installation and sizing requirements for {product-title-short}. Deploying and managing {product-title-short} components does not fall under the service description for the managed service, and therefore {product-title-short} is not included in the SRE service.
3. Do not use the `roxctl` installation method unless you have a specific installation that requires this method.
4. {product-title-short} Central is tested, qualified, and is fully supported exclusively on {ocp} 4. Deployment and use of Central in environments that are not {ocp} 4 is possible, but support is limited to the {product-title-short} product software only and not to the underlying infrastructure provider. As part of problem diagnosis and isolation, it is necessary to reproduce problems in an {ocp} 4 environment. If an issue is specific to a provider and cluster that is not {ocp} 4, Red Hat provides commercially reasonable support to isolate issues. You are expected to open a case with your respective provider. For instructions, see the https://access.redhat.com/third-party-software-support[Red Hat 3rd Party Support Policy].
