You can install {product-title} on installer-provisioned or user-provisioned infrastructure. The default installation type uses installer-provisioned infrastructure, where the installation program provisions the underlying infrastructure for the cluster. You can also install {product-title} on infrastructure that you provision. If you do not use infrastructure that the installation program provisions, you must manage and maintain the cluster resources yourself.

See xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#installation-process_architecture-installation[Installation process] for more information about installer-provisioned and user-provisioned installation processes.

You can install a cluster on Azure infrastructure that is provisioned by the {product-title} installation program, by using one of the following methods:

* **xref:../../installing/installing_azure/ipi/installing-azure-default.adoc#installing-azure-default[Installing a cluster quickly on Azure]**: You can install {product-title} on Azure infrastructure that is provisioned by the {product-title} installation program. You can install a cluster quickly by using the default configuration options.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_azure/ipi/installing-azure-customizations.adoc#installing-azure-customizations[Installing a customized cluster on Azure]**: You can install a customized cluster on Azure infrastructure that the installation program provisions. The installation program allows for some customization to be applied at the installation stage. Many other customization options are available xref:../../post_installation_configuration/cluster-tasks.adoc#post-install-cluster-tasks[post-installation].

* **xref:../../installing/installing_azure/ipi/installing-azure-network-customizations.adoc#installing-azure-network-customizations[Installing a cluster on Azure with network customizations]**: You can customize your {product-title} network configuration during installation, so that your cluster can coexist with your existing IP address allocations and adhere to your network requirements.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_azure/ipi/installing-restricted-networks-azure-installer-provisioned.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-azure-installer-provisioned[Installing a cluster on Azure in a restricted network]** : You can install a cluster on Microsoft Azure in a restricted network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content on an existing Azure Virtual Network (VNet).

* **xref:../../installing/installing_azure/ipi/installing-azure-vnet.adoc#installing-azure-vnet[Installing a cluster on Azure into an existing VNet]**: You can install {product-title} on an existing Azure Virtual Network (VNet) on Azure.
