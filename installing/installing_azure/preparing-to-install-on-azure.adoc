You can install {product-title} on installer-provisioned or user-provisioned infrastructure. The default installation type uses installer-provisioned infrastructure, where the installation program provisions the underlying infrastructure for the cluster. You can also install {product-title} on infrastructure that you provision. If you do not use infrastructure that the installation program provisions, you must manage and maintain the cluster resources yourself.

See xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#installation-process_architecture-installation[Installation process] for more information about installer-provisioned and user-provisioned installation processes.

== Installing a cluster on installer-provisioned infrastructure

You can install a cluster on {azure-first} infrastructure that is provisioned by the {product-title} installation program, by using one of the following methods:

* **xref:../../installing/installing_azure/ipi/installing-azure-default.adoc#installing-azure-default[Installing a cluster quickly on Azure]**: You can install {product-title} on {azure-short} infrastructure that is provisioned by the {product-title} installation program. You can install a cluster quickly by using the default configuration options.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_azure/ipi/installing-azure-customizations.adoc#installing-azure-customizations[Installing a customized cluster on {azure-short}]**: You can install a customized cluster on {azure-short} infrastructure that the installation program provisions. The installation program allows for some customization to be applied at the installation stage. Many other customization options are available xref:../../post_installation_configuration/cluster-tasks.adoc#post-install-cluster-tasks[post-installation].

* **xref:../../installing/installing_azure/ipi/installing-azure-network-customizations.adoc#installing-azure-network-customizations[Installing a cluster on {azure-short} with network customizations]**: You can customize your {product-title} network configuration during installation, so that your cluster can coexist with your existing IP address allocations and adhere to your network requirements.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_azure/ipi/installing-restricted-networks-azure-installer-provisioned.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-azure-installer-provisioned[Installing a cluster on {azure-short} in a restricted network]** : You can install a cluster on {azure-short} in a restricted network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content on an existing Azure Virtual Network (VNet).

* **xref:../../installing/installing_azure/ipi/installing-azure-vnet.adoc#installing-azure-vnet[Installing a cluster on {azure-short} into an existing VNet]**: You can install {product-title} on an existing Azure Virtual Network (VNet) on Azure. You can use this installation method if you have constraints set by the guidelines of your company, such as limits when creating new accounts or infrastructure.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_azure/ipi/installing-azure-private.adoc#installing-azure-private[Installing a private cluster on {azure-short}]**: You can install a private cluster into an existing Azure Virtual Network (VNet) on {azure-short}. You can use this method to deploy {product-title} on an internal network that is not visible to the internet.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_azure/ipi/installing-azure-government-region.adoc#installing-azure-government-region[Installing a cluster on {azure-short} into a government region]**: {product-title} can be deployed into Microsoft Azure Government (MAG) regions that are specifically designed for US government agencies at the federal, state, and local level, as well as contractors, educational institutions, and other US customers that must run sensitive workloads on {azure-short}.

== Installing a cluster on user-provisioned infrastructure

You can install a cluster on {azure-short} infrastructure that you provision, by using one of the following methods:

* **xref:../../installing/installing_azure/upi/installing-restricted-networks-azure-user-provisioned.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-azure-user-provisioned[Installing a cluster on {azure-short} in a restricted network with user-provisioned infrastructure]**: You can perform an installation on Azure that does not require an active connection to the internet to obtain software components.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_azure/upi/installing-azure-user-infra.adoc#installing-azure-user-infra[Installing a cluster on {azure-short} using ARM templates]**: You can install {product-title} on {azure-short} by using infrastructure that you provide. You can use the provided Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to assist with an installation.
