toc::[]

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster with a
customized network configuration on infrastructure that the installation program
provisions on Microsoft Azure. By customizing your network configuration, your
cluster can coexist with existing IP address allocations in your environment and
integrate with existing MTU and VXLAN configurations.

You must set most of the network configuration parameters during installation,
and you can modify only `kubeProxy` configuration parameters in a running
cluster.

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:../../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-account.adoc#installing-azure-account[configured an Azure account] to host the cluster and determined the tested and validated region to deploy the cluster to.
* If you use a firewall, you xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
* If the cloud identity and access management (IAM) APIs are not accessible in your environment, or if you do not want to store an administrator-level credential secret in the `kube-system` namespace, you can xref:../../installing/installing_azure/manually-creating-iam-azure.adoc#manually-creating-iam-azure[manually create and maintain IAM credentials]. Manual mode can also be used in environments where the cloud IAM APIs are not reachable.
