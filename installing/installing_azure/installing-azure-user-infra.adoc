toc::[]

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on Microsoft Azure by using infrastructure that you provide.

Several link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview[Azure Resource Manager] (ARM) templates are provided to assist in completing these steps or to help model your own.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The steps for performing a user-provisioned infrastructure installation are provided as an example only. Installing a cluster with infrastructure you provide requires knowledge of the cloud provider and the installation process of {product-title}. Several ARM templates are provided to assist in completing these steps or to help model your own. You are also free to create the required resources through other methods; the templates are just an example.
====

== Prerequisites

* Review details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* xref:../../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-account.adoc#installing-azure-account[Configure an Azure account] to host the cluster.
* Download the Azure CLI and install it on your computer. See link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest[Install the Azure CLI] in the Azure documentation. The documentation below was last tested using version `2.2.0` of the Azure CLI. Azure CLI commands might perform differently based on the version you use.
* If you use a firewall and plan to use telemetry, you must xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configure the firewall to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
* If you do not allow the system to manage identity and access management (IAM), then a cluster administrator can xref:../../installing/installing_azure/manually-creating-iam-azure.adoc#manually-creating-iam-azure[manually create and maintain IAM credentials]. Manual mode can also be used in environments where the cloud IAM APIs are not reachable.

== Configuring your Azure project

Before you can install {product-title}, you must configure an Azure project to host it.

[IMPORTANT]
====
All Azure resources that are available through public endpoints are subject to resource name restrictions, and you cannot create resources that use certain terms. For a list of terms that Azure restricts, see link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-reserved-resource-name[Resolve reserved resource name errors] in the Azure documentation.
