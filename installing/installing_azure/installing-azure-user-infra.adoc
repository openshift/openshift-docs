toc::[]

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on
Microsoft Azure by using infrastructure that you provide.

Several
link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview[Azure Resource Manager]
(ARM) templates are provided to assist in completing these steps or to help
model your own. You can also create the required resources through other
methods; the templates are just an example.

.Prerequisites

* Review details about the
xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update]
processes.
* xref:../../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-account.adoc#installing-azure-account[Configure an Azure account]
to host the cluster.
* Download the Azure CLI and install it on your computer. See
link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest[Install the Azure CLI]
in the Azure documentation. The documentation below was last tested using
version `2.2.0` of the Azure CLI. Azure CLI commands might perform differently
based on the version you use.
* If you use a firewall and plan to use telemetry, you must
xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configure the firewall to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.

== Configuring your Azure project

Before you can install {product-title}, you must configure an Azure project to
host it.

[IMPORTANT]
====
All Azure resources that are available through public endpoints are subject to
resource name restrictions, and you cannot create resources that use certain
terms. For a list of terms that Azure restricts, see
link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-reserved-resource-name[Resolve reserved resource name errors]
in the Azure documentation.

=== Certificate signing requests management

Because your cluster has limited access to automatic machine management when you
use infrastructure that you provision, you must provide a mechanism for approving
cluster certificate signing requests (CSRs) after installation. The
`kube-controller-manager` only approves the kubelet client CSRs. The
`machine-approver` cannot guarantee the validity of a serving certificate
that is requested by using kubelet credentials because it cannot confirm that
the correct machine issued the request. You must determine and implement a
method of verifying the validity of the kubelet serving certificate requests
and approving them.
