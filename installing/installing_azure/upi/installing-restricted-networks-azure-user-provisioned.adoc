= Installing a cluster on Azure in a restricted network with user-provisioned infrastructure
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: installing-restricted-networks-azure-user-provisioned

toc::[]

In {product-title}, you can install a cluster on Microsoft Azure by using infrastructure that you provide.

Several link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview[Azure Resource Manager] (ARM) templates are provided to assist in completing these steps or to help model your own.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The steps for performing a user-provisioned infrastructure installation are provided as an example only. Installing a cluster with infrastructure you provide requires knowledge of the cloud provider and the installation process of {product-title}. Several ARM templates are provided to assist in completing these steps or to help model your own. You are also free to create the required resources through other methods.
====

.Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../../installing/overview/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:../../../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-account.adoc#installing-azure-account[configured an Azure account] to host the cluster and determined the tested and validated region to deploy the cluster to.
* You xref:../../../disconnected/mirroring/installing-mirroring-installation-images.adoc#installation-about-mirror-registry_installing-mirroring-installation-images[mirrored the images for a disconnected installation] to your registry and obtained the `imageContentSources` data for your version of {product-title}.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the installation media is on the mirror host, you must use that computer to complete all installation steps.
====
* If you use a firewall, you xref:../../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
* If the cloud identity and access management (IAM) APIs are not accessible in your environment, or if you do not want to store an administrator-level credential secret in the `kube-system` namespace, you have xref:../../../installing/installing_azure/ipi/installing-azure-customizations.adoc#manually-create-iam_installing-azure-customizations[manually created long-term credentials].
* If you use customer-managed encryption keys, you xref:../../../installing/installing_azure/ipi/installing-azure-preparing-ipi.adoc#preparing-disk-encryption-sets_installing-azure-preparing-ipi[prepared your Azure environment for encryption].

== Configuring your Azure project

Before you can install {product-title}, you must configure an Azure project to host it.

[IMPORTANT]
====
All Azure resources that are available through public endpoints are subject to resource name restrictions, and you cannot create resources that use certain terms. For a list of terms that Azure restricts, see link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-reserved-resource-name[Resolve reserved resource name errors] in the Azure documentation.
