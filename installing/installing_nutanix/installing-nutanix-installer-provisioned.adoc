In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on your Nutanix instance that uses installer-provisioned infrastructure.

== Prerequisites

* You have reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* If you use a firewall, you have configured it to xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[grant access] to the sites that {product-title} requires. This includes the use of Telemetry.
* If your Nutanix environment is using the default self-signed SSL certificate, replace it with a certificate that is signed by a CA. The installation program requires a valid CA-signed certificate to access to the Prism Central API. For more information about replacing the self-signed certificate, see the  https://portal.nutanix.com/page/documents/details?targetId=Nutanix-Security-Guide-v6_1:mul-security-ssl-certificate-pc-t.html[Nutanix AOS Security Guide].

== Configuring the default storage container
After you install the cluster, you must install the Nutanix CSI Operator and configure the default storage container for the cluster.
