In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on your Nutanix instance with two methods:

* Using the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform/2022/html-single/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform/index[{ai-full}] hosted at link:http://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com]. This method requires no setup for the installer, and is ideal for connected environments like Nutanix. Installing with the {ai-full} also provides integration with Nutanix, enabling autoscaling. See xref:../../installing/installing_on_prem_assisted/installing-on-prem-assisted.adoc#installing-on-prem-assisted[Installing an on-premise cluster using the {ai-full}] for additional details.

* Using installer-provisioned infrastructure. Use the procedures in the following sections to use installer-provisioned infrastructure. Installer-provisioned infrastructure is ideal for installing in environments with air-gapped/restricted networks.

== Prerequisites

* You have reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* If you use a firewall, you have configured it to xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[grant access] to the sites that {product-title} requires. This includes the use of Telemetry.
* If your Nutanix environment is using the default self-signed SSL certificate, replace it with a certificate that is signed by a CA. The installation program requires a valid CA-signed certificate to access to the Prism Central API. For more information about replacing the self-signed certificate, see the  https://portal.nutanix.com/page/documents/details?targetId=Nutanix-Security-Guide-v6_1:mul-security-ssl-certificate-pc-t.html[Nutanix AOS Security Guide].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use 2048-bit certificates. The installation fails if you use 4096-bit certificates with Prism Central 2022.x.

== Configuring the default storage container
After you install the cluster, you must install the Nutanix CSI Operator and configure the default storage container for the cluster.

For more information, see the Nutanix documentation for link:https://opendocs.nutanix.com/openshift/operators/csi/[installing the CSI Operator] and link:https://opendocs.nutanix.com/openshift/install/ipi/#openshift-image-registry-configuration[configuring registry storage].
