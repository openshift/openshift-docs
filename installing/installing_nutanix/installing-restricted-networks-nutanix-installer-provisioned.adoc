In {product-title} {product-version}, you can install a cluster on Nutanix infrastructure in a restricted network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content.

== Prerequisites

* You have reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* The installation program requires access to port 9440 on Prism Central and Prism Element. You verified that port 9440 is accessible.
* If you use a firewall, you have met these prerequisites:
** You confirmed that port 9440 is accessible. Control plane nodes must be able to reach Prism Central and Prism Element on port 9440 for the installation to succeed.
** You configured the firewall to xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[grant access] to the sites that {product-title} requires. This includes the use of Telemetry.
* If your Nutanix environment is using the default self-signed SSL/TLS certificate, replace it with a certificate that is signed by a CA. The installation program requires a valid CA-signed certificate to access to the Prism Central API. For more information about replacing the self-signed certificate, see the  https://portal.nutanix.com/page/documents/details?targetId=Nutanix-Security-Guide-v6_1:mul-security-ssl-certificate-pc-t.html[Nutanix AOS Security Guide].
+
If your Nutanix environment uses an internal CA to issue certificates, you must configure a cluster-wide proxy as part of the installation process. For more information, see xref:../../networking/configuring-a-custom-pki.adoc#configuring-a-custom-pki[Configuring a custom PKI].
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Use 2048-bit certificates. The installation fails if you use 4096-bit certificates with Prism Central 2022.x.
====
* You have a container image registry, such as Red Hat Quay. If you do not already have a registry, you can create a mirror registry using  xref:../../disconnected/mirroring/installing-mirroring-creating-registry.adoc#installing-mirroring-creating-registry[_mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_].
* You have used the xref:../../disconnected/mirroring/installing-mirroring-disconnected.adoc#installing-mirroring-disconnected[oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (oc) plugin] to mirror all of the required {product-title} content and other images, including the Nutanix CSI Operator, to your mirror registry.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the installation media is on the mirror host, you can use that computer to complete all installation steps.
