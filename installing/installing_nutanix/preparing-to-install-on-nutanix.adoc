== Agent-based Installer

You can install an {product-title} cluster on Nutanix by using the Agent-based Installer.
For example, the Agent-based Installer can be used to install a three-node cluster, which is a smaller, more resource efficient cluster for testing, development, and production. See xref:../../installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer.adoc#preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer[Preparing to install with the Agent-based Installer] for additional details.
