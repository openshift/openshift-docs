The installation workflows documented in this section are for IBM Cloud VPC infrastructure environments. IBM Cloud Classic is not supported at this time. For more information about the difference between Classic and VPC infrastructures, see the IBM link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-infrastructure?topic=cloud-infrastructure-compare-infrastructure[documentation].

[id="prerequisites_preparing-to-install-on-ibm-cloud"]
== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.

* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].

[id="requirements-for-installing-ocp-on-ibm-cloud"]
== Requirements for installing {product-title} on IBM Cloud VPC

Before installing {product-title} on IBM Cloud VPC, you must create a service account and configure an IBM Cloud account. See xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud_public/installing-ibm-cloud-account.adoc#installing-ibm-cloud-account[Configuring an IBM Cloud account] for details about creating an account, enabling API services, configuring DNS, IBM Cloud account limits, and supported IBM Cloud VPC regions.

You must manually manage your cloud credentials when installing a cluster to IBM Cloud VPC. Do this by configuring the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) for manual mode before you install the cluster. For more information, see xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud_public/configuring-iam-ibm-cloud.adoc#configuring-iam-ibm-cloud[Configuring IAM for IBM Cloud VPC].

[id="choosing-a-method-to-install-ocp-on-ibm-cloud"]
== Choosing a method to install {product-title} on IBM Cloud VPC

You can install {product-title} on IBM Cloud VPC using installer-provisioned infrastructure. This process involves using an installation program to provision the underlying infrastructure for your cluster. Installing {product-title} on IBM Cloud VPC using user-provisioned infrastructure is not supported at this time.

See xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#installation-process_architecture-installation[Installation process] for more information about installer-provisioned installation processes.

=== Installing a cluster on installer-provisioned infrastructure

You can install a cluster on IBM Cloud VPC infrastructure that is provisioned by the {product-title} installation program by using one of the following methods:

* **xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud_public/installing-ibm-cloud-customizations.adoc#installing-ibm-cloud-customizations[Installing a customized cluster on IBM Cloud VPC]**: You can install a customized cluster on IBM Cloud VPC infrastructure that the installation program provisions. The installation program allows for some customization to be applied at the installation stage. Many other customization options are available xref:../../post_installation_configuration/cluster-tasks.adoc#post-install-cluster-tasks[post-installation].

* **xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud_public/installing-ibm-cloud-network-customizations.adoc#installing-ibm-cloud-network-customizations[Installing a cluster on IBM Cloud VPC with network customizations]**: You can customize your {product-title} network configuration during installation, so that your cluster can coexist with your existing IP address allocations and adhere to your network requirements.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud_public/installing-ibm-cloud-vpc.adoc#installing-ibm-cloud-vpc[Installing a cluster on IBM Cloud VPC into an existing VPC]**: You can install {product-title} on an existing IBM  Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). You can use this installation method if you have constraints set by the guidelines of your company, such as limits when creating new accounts or infrastructure.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud_public/installing-ibm-cloud-private.adoc#installing-ibm-cloud-private[Installing a private cluster on an existing VPC]**: You can install a private cluster on an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). You can use this method to deploy {product-title} on an internal network that is not visible to the internet.
