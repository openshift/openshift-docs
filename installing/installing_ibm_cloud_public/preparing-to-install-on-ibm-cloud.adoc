== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.

* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The installation workflows documented in this section are for IBM Cloud VPC infrastructure environments. IBM Cloud Classic is not supported at this time. For more information on the difference between Classic and VPC infrastructures, see IBM's link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-infrastructure?topic=cloud-infrastructure-compare-infrastructure[documentation].

== Requirements for installing {product-title} on IBM Cloud

Before installing {product-title} on IBM Cloud, you must create a service account and configure an IBM Cloud account. See xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud_public/installing-ibm-cloud-account.adoc#installing-ibm-cloud-account[Configuring an IBM Cloud account] for details about creating an account, enabling API services, configuring DNS, IBM Cloud account limits, and supported IBM Cloud regions.

You must manually manage your cloud credentials when installing a cluster to IBM Cloud. Do this by configuring the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) for manual mode before you install the cluster. For more information, see xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud_public/configuring-iam-ibm-cloud.adoc#configuring-iam-ibm-cloud[Configuring IAM for IBM Cloud].

[id="choosing-a-method-to-install-ocp-on-ibm-cloud"]
== Choosing a method to install {product-title} on IBM Cloud

You can install {product-title} on IBM Cloud using installer-provisioned infrastructure. This process involves using an installation program to provision the underlying infrastructure for your cluster. Installing {product-title} on IBM Cloud using user-provisioned infrastructure is not supported at this time.

See xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#installation-process_architecture-installation[Installation process] for more information about installer-provisioned installation processes.

=== Installing a cluster on installer-provisioned infrastructure

You can install a cluster on IBM Cloud infrastructure that is provisioned by the {product-title} installation program by using one of the following methods:

* **xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud_public/installing-ibm-cloud-customizations.adoc#installing-ibm-cloud-customizations[Installing a customized cluster on IBM Cloud]**: You can install a customized cluster on IBM Cloud infrastructure that the installation program provisions. The installation program allows for some customization to be applied at the installation stage. Many other customization options are available xref:../../post_installation_configuration/cluster-tasks.adoc#post-install-cluster-tasks[post-installation].

* **xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud_public/installing-ibm-cloud-network-customizations.adoc#installing-ibm-cloud-network-customizations[Installing a cluster on IBM Cloud with network customizations]**: You can customize your {product-title} network configuration during installation, so that your cluster can coexist with your existing IP address allocations and adhere to your network requirements.
