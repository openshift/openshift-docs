= {oadp-short} Self-Service backup and restore phases

[role="_abstract"]
Review the status phases of `NonAdminBackup` (NAB) and `NonAdminRestore` (NAR) custom resources to track the progress and state of backup and restore operations. This helps you monitor and troubleshoot Self-Service backup and restore requests.

The phase of the CRs only progress forward. Once a phase transitions to the next phase, it cannot revert to a previous phase.

.Phases
|===
|*Value* |*Description*
|`New`|A creation request of the NAB or NAR CR is accepted by the NAC, but it has not yet been validated by the NAC.
|`BackingOff`|NAB or NAR CR is invalidated by the NAC CR because of an invalid `spec` of the NAB or NAR  CR. 

The namespace admin user can update the NAB or NAR `spec` to comply with the policies set by the administrator. After the namespace admin user edits the CRs, the NAC reconciles the CR again.
|`Created`|NAB or NAR CR is validated by the NAC, and the `Velero` backup or restore object is created.
|`Deletion`|NAB or NAR CR is marked for deletion. The NAC deletes the corresponding `Velero` backup or restore object. When the `Velero` object is deleted, the NAB or NAR CR is also deleted.
