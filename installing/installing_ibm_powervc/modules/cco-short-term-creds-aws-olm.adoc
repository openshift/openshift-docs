= OLM-managed Operator support for authentication with {aws-short} {sts-short}

Certain Operators managed by the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) on {aws-short} clusters can use manual mode with {sts-short}. 
These Operators authenticate with limited-privilege, short-term credentials that are managed outside the cluster. 
To determine if an Operator supports authentication with {aws-short} {sts-short}, see the Operator description in the software catalog.
