= About the OSToy application

[role="_abstract"]
OSToy is a Node.js application that deploys to a {product-title} cluster to help explore the functionality of Kubernetes.

This application has a user interface where you can:

* Write messages to the log (stdout / stderr)
* Intentionally crash the application to view self-healing
* Toggle a liveness probe and monitor OpenShift behavior
* Read ConfigMaps, secrets, and environment variables
* Read and write files when connected to shared storage
* Check network connectivity, intra-cluster DNS, and intra-communication with the included microservice
* Increase the load to view automatic scaling of the pods by using the HPA
//* Connect to an AWS S3 bucket to read and write objects
