= Deploying the front-end application

[role="_abstract"]
Deploy the front-end application that provides the external-facing web component for the tutorial.

The simplest way to deploy an application in {product-title} is to run a provided container image.

The following procedure deploys `parksmap`, which is the front-end component of the `national-parks-app` application. The web application displays an interactive map of the locations of national parks across the world.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} cluster.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

* Deploy the `parksmap` application by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-app quay.io/openshiftroadshow/parksmap:latest --name=parksmap -l 'app=national-parks-app,component=parksmap,role=frontend,app.kubernetes.io/part-of=national-parks-app'
----
+
.Example output
[source,text]
----
--> Found container image 0c2f55f (4 years old) from quay.io for "quay.io/openshiftroadshow/parksmap:latest"

    * An image stream tag will be created as "parksmap:latest" that will track this image

--> Creating resources with label app=national-parks-app,app.kubernetes.io/part-of=national-parks-app,component=parksmap,role=frontend ...
    imagestream.image.openshift.io "parksmap" created
    deployment.apps "parksmap" created
    service "parksmap" created
--> Success
    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose service/parksmap'
