= {microshift-short} default networking plugin

[role="_abstract"]
The OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin is the default networking solution for a {microshift-short} node. OVN-Kubernetes is a virtualized network for pods and services that is based on Open Virtual Network (OVN).

* Changing the CNI is not supported on {microshift-short}.
* Default network configuration and connections are applied automatically in {microshift-short} with the `microshift-networking` RPM during installation.
* A node that uses the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin also runs Open vSwitch (OVS) on the node.
* OVN-K configures OVS on the node to implement the declared network configuration.
* Host physical interfaces are not bound by default to the OVN-K gateway bridge, `br-ex`. You can use standard tools on the host for managing the default gateway, such as the Network Manager CLI (`nmcli`).

Using configuration files or custom scripts, you can configure the following networking settings:

* You can use subnet CIDR ranges to allocate IP addresses to pods.
* You can change the maximum transmission unit (MTU) value.
* You can configure firewall ingress and egress.
* You can define network policies in the {microshift-short}, including ingress and egress rules.
* You can use the {microshift-short} Multus plugin to chain other CNI plugins.
* You can configure or remove the ingress router.
