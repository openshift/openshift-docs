= Overview of GNSS timing for PTP grandmaster clocks

{product-title} supports receiving precision PTP timing from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) sources and grandmaster clocks (T-GM) in the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} supports PTP timing from GNSS sources with Intel E810 Westport Channel NICs only.

Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)::
GNSS is a satellite-based system used to provide positioning, navigation, and timing information to receivers around the globe.
In PTP, GNSS receivers are often used as a highly accurate and stable reference clock source.
These receivers receive signals from multiple GNSS satellites, allowing them to calculate precise time information.
The timing information obtained from GNSS is used as a reference by the PTP grandmaster clock.
+
By using GNSS as a reference, the grandmaster clock in the PTP network can provide highly accurate timestamps to other devices, enabling precise synchronization across the entire network.

Digital Phase-Locked Loop (DPLL)::
DPLL provides clock synchronization between different PTP nodes in the network.
DPLL compares the phase of the local system clock signal with the phase of the incoming synchronization signal, for example, PTP messages from the PTP grandmaster clock.
The DPLL continuously adjusts the local clock frequency and phase to minimize the phase difference between the local clock and the reference clock.

== Handling leap second events in GNSS-synced PTP grandmaster clocks

A leap second is a one-second adjustment that is occasionally applied to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to keep it synchronized with International Atomic Time (TAI).
UTC leap seconds are unpredictable.
Internationally agreed leap seconds are listed in link:https://hpiers.obspm.fr/iers/bul/bulc/ntp/leap-seconds.list[leap-seconds.list].
This file is regularly updated by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS).
An unhandled leap second can have a significant impact on far edge RAN networks.
It can cause the far edge RAN application to immediately disconnect voice calls and data sessions.
