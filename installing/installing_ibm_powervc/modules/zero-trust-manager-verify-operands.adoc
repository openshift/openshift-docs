= Verify the health of the operands

[role="_abstract"]
View the status fields to verify the operational health of managed components. This information helps you confirm that the SPIRE Server, SPIRE Agent, SPIFFE CSI driver, and the SPIRE OIDC discovery provider operands are ready and functioning correctly.

* To verify the operands, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc get ZeroTrustWorkloadIdentityManager cluster -o yaml
----
+
.Example output

[source,yaml]

This status is reflected when all operands are healthy and stable.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Operator adds the owner reference for the `ZeroTrustWorkloadIdentityManager` CR on the other operands' CRs. This causes the operands' resources to be deleted once the `ZeroTrustWorkloadIdentityManager` CRs are deleted.
