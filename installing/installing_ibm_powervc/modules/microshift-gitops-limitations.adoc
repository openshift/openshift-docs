= Limitations of using the {gitops} agent with {microshift-short}

[role="_abstract"]
Using {gitops-title} with Argo CD for {microshift-short} is different from using the entire {gitops} Operator in the following ways:

* The `gitops-operator` component is not used with {microshift-short}.
* To maintain the small resource use of {microshift-short} use the Argo CD CLI. The Argo CD web console is not available.
* Because {microshift-short} is single-node, there is no multi-node support. Each instance of {microshift-short} is paired with a local {gitops} agent.
* The `oc adm must-gather` command is not available in {microshift-short}.
