= Configuring Confidential VM by using machine sets

By editing the machine set YAML file, you can configure the Confidential VM options that a machine set uses for machines that it deploys.

For more information about Confidential VM features, functions, and compatibility, see the {gcp-short} Compute Engine documentation about link:https://cloud.google.com/confidential-computing/confidential-vm/docs/about-cvm#confidential-vm[Confidential VM].

[NOTE]
====
Confidential VMs are currently not supported on 64-bit ARM architectures.
If you use Confidential VM, you must ensure that you select a supported region. For details on supported regions and configurations, see the {gcp-short} Compute Engine documentation about link:https://cloud.google.com/confidential-computing/confidential-vm/docs/supported-configurations#supported-zones[supported zones].

.Procedure

. In a text editor, open the YAML file for an existing machine set or create a new one.

. Edit the following section under the `providerSpec` field:
+
[source,yaml]
----
ifndef::cpmso[]
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineSet
# ...
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      providerSpec:
        value:
          confidentialCompute: Enabled <1>
          onHostMaintenance: Terminate <2>
          machineType: n2d-standard-8 <3>
endif::cpmso[]
ifdef::cpmso[]
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1
kind: ControlPlaneMachineSet
# ...
    machines_v1beta1_machine_openshift_io:
      spec:
        providerSpec:
          value:
            confidentialCompute: Enabled <1>
            onHostMaintenance: Terminate <2>
            machineType: n2d-standard-8 <3>
endif::cpmso[]
# ...
----
<1> Specify whether Confidential VM is enabled. The following values are valid:

`Enabled`:: Enables Confidential VM with a default selection of Confidential VM technology. The default selection is AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (AMD SEV).
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `Enabled` value selects Confidential Computing with AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (AMD SEV), which is deprecated.
====

`Disabled`:: Disables Confidential VM.

`AMDEncryptedVirtualizationNestedPaging`:: Enables Confidential VM using AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization Secure Nested Paging (AMD SEV-SNP). AMD SEV-SNP supports n2d machines.

`AMDEncryptedVirtualization`:: Enables Confidential VM using AMD SEV. AMD SEV supports c2d, n2d, and c3d machines.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The use of Confidential Computing with AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (AMD SEV) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
====

`IntelTrustedDomainExtensions`:: Enables Confidential VM using Intel Trusted Domain Extensions (Intel TDX). Intel TDX supports n2d machines.
+
<2> Specify the behavior of the VM during a host maintenance event, such as a hardware or software update. For a machine that uses Confidential VM, this value must be set to `Terminate`, which stops the VM. Confidential VM does not support live VM migration.
<3> Specify a machine type that supports the Confidential VM option that you specified in the `confidentialCompute` field.

.Verification

* On the {gcp-full} console, review the details for a machine deployed by the machine set and verify that the Confidential VM options match the values that you configured.
