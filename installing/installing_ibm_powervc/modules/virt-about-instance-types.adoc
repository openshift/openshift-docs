= About instance types

[role="_abstract"]
An instance type is a reusable object where you can define resources and characteristics to apply to new VMs. You can define custom instance types or use the variety that are included when you install {VirtProductName}.

To create a new instance type, you must first create a manifest, either manually or by using the `virtctl` CLI tool. You then create the instance type object by applying the manifest to your cluster.

{VirtProductName} provides two CRDs for configuring instance types:

* A namespaced object: `VirtualMachineInstancetype`
* A cluster-wide object: `VirtualMachineClusterInstancetype`

These objects use the same `VirtualMachineInstancetypeSpec`.

[id="required-attributes_{context}"]
== Required attributes

When you configure an instance type, you must define the `cpu` and `memory` attributes. Other attributes are optional.

[NOTE]
====
When you create a VM from an instance type, you cannot override any parameters defined in the instance type.

Because instance types require defined CPU and memory attributes, {VirtProductName} always rejects additional requests for these resources when creating a VM from an instance type.
====

You can manually create an instance type manifest. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: instancetype.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualMachineInstancetype
metadata:
  name: example-instancetype
spec:
  cpu:
    guest: 1 <1>
  memory:
    guest: 128Mi <2>
----
<1> Required. Specifies the number of vCPUs to allocate to the guest.
<2> Required. Specifies an amount of memory to allocate to the guest.

You can create an instance type manifest by using the `virtctl` CLI utility. For example:

[source,terminal]
----
$ virtctl create instancetype --cpu 2 --memory 256Mi
----

where:

`--cpu <value>`:: Specifies the number of vCPUs to allocate to the guest. Required.
`--memory <value>`:: Specifies an amount of memory to allocate to the guest. Required.

[TIP]
====
You can immediately create the object from the new manifest by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ virtctl create instancetype --cpu 2 --memory 256Mi | oc apply -f -
----
====

[id="optional-attributes_{context}"]
== Optional attributes

In addition to the required `cpu` and `memory` attributes, you can include the following optional attributes in the `VirtualMachineInstancetypeSpec`:

`annotations`:: List annotations to apply to the VM.
`gpus`:: List vGPUs for passthrough.
`hostDevices`:: List host devices for passthrough.
`ioThreadsPolicy`:: Define an IO threads policy for managing dedicated disk access.
`launchSecurity`:: Configure Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV).
`nodeSelector`:: Specify node selectors to control the nodes where this VM is scheduled.
`schedulerName`:: Define a custom scheduler to use for this VM instead of the default scheduler.

[id="virt-about-instance-types-controller-revisions_{context}"]
== Controller revisions

When you create a VM by using an instance type, a `ControllerRevision` object retains an immutable snapshot of the instance type object. This snapshot locks in resource-related characteristics defined in the instance type object, such as the required guest CPU and memory. The VM status also contains a reference to the `ControllerRevision` object.

This snapshot is essential for versioning, and ensures that the VM instance created when starting a VM does not change if the underlying instance type object is updated while the VM is running.
