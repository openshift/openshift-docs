[role="_abstract"]
Retrieve detailed pod information to confirm the running status and resource configuration of the applications in this tutorial.

{product-title} uses the Kubernetes concept of a _pod_, which is one or more containers deployed together on one host, and the smallest compute unit that can be defined, deployed, and managed.
Pods are the rough equivalent of a machine instance, physical or virtual, to a container.

The *Overview* panel enables you to access many features of the `parksmap` deployment. The *Details* and *Resources* tabs enable you to scale application pods and check the status of builds, services, and routes.

.Prerequisites

* You have deployed the `parksmap` front-end application.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Workloads* -> *Topology*.
. Click the `parksmap` deployment in the `national-parks-app` application.

This opens an overview panel with the following tabs:

** *Details*: View details about your deployment, edit certain settings, and scale your deployment.

** *Resources*: View details for the pods, services, and routes associated with your deployment.

** *Observe*: View metrics and events for your deployment.

. To view the logs for a pod, select the *Resources* tab and click *View logs* next to the `parksmap` pod.
