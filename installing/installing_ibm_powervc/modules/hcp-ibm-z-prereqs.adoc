* The {mce} version 2.7 or later must be installed on an {product-title} cluster. You can install {mce-short} as an Operator from the {product-title} OperatorHub.

* The {mce-short} must have at least one managed {product-title} cluster. The `local-cluster` is automatically imported in {mce-short} 2.7 and later. For more information about the `local-cluster`, see _Advanced configuration_ in the Red{nbsp}Hat Advanced Cluster Management documentation. You can check the status of your hub cluster by running the following command:
