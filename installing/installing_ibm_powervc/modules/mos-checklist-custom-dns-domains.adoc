= Custom DNS and domains

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure a custom domain name server and custom domain name for your cluster.

.Prerequisites
* By default, {product-title} clusters require you to set the `domain name servers` option to `AmazonProvidedDNS` to ensure successful cluster creation and operation.
* To use a custom DNS server and domain name for your cluster, the {product-title} installer must be able to use VPC DNS with default DHCP options so that it can resolve internal IPs and services. This means that you must create a custom DHCP option set to forward DNS lookups to your DNS server, and associate this option set with your VPC before you create the cluster.

.Procedure
* Confirm that your VPC is using VPC Resolver by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws ec2 describe-dhcp-options
