= Installation method advantages

[role="_abstract"]
This method has several advantages for users who want to install a cluster primarily to run virtualized workloads using {VirtProductName}.

Simplified web interface:: The cluster installation is performed through a graphical user interface.
In addition to providing reasonable default configurations, this interface guides you through the installation by providing hints and warnings about configuring your cluster, without limiting the configurations that are available at installation time.
This reduces the need for in-depth knowledge of {product-title} while still allowing for complex configurations to be made.

No external registry needed:: If you are installing your cluster in a disconnected environment, you do not need to configure an external image registry in your environment when using this method.
All other disconnected installation methods require this additional environment setup.

Included Operator bundle:: You can install the Virtualization bundle, which includes all of the additional {olm-first} Operators needed to run virtual machines on your cluster, at the same time as the cluster installation.

[NOTE]
====
This installation method does not come with any storage Operators as part of the Operator bundle.
You must configure your own storage solution separately.
