= Preparing to deploy {hcp} on bare metal

As you prepare to deploy {hcp} on bare metal, consider the following information:

- Run the management cluster and workers on the same platform for {hcp}.

- All bare metal hosts require a manual start with a Discovery Image ISO that the central infrastructure management provides. You can start the hosts manually or through automation by using `Cluster-Baremetal-Operator`. After each host starts, it runs an Agent process to discover the host details and complete the installation. An `Agent` custom resource represents each host.

- When you configure storage for {hcp}, consider the recommended etcd practices. To ensure that you meet the latency requirements, dedicate a fast storage device to all hosted control plane etcd instances that run on each control-plane node. You can use LVM storage to configure a local storage class for hosted etcd pods. For more information, see "Recommended etcd practices" and "Persistent storage using logical volume manager storage".
