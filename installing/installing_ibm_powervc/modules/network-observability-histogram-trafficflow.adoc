= Using the histogram

[role="_abstract"]
The histogram provides a visualization of network flow logs that you can use to analyze traffic volume trends and filter flow data by specific time intervals.

You can click *Show histogram* to display a toolbar view for visualizing the history of flows as a bar chart. The histogram shows the number of logs over time. You can select a part of the histogram to filter the network flow data in the table that follows the toolbar.
