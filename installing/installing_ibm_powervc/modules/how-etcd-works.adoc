= How etcd works

To ensure a reliable approach to cluster configuration and management, etcd uses the etcd Operator. The Operator simplifies the use of etcd on a Kubernetes container platform such as {product-title}.

Additionally, you can use the etcd Operator to deploy and manage the etcd cluster for the {product-title} control plane. The etcd Operator manages the cluster state in the following ways:

* Observes the cluster state by using the Kubernetes API
* Analyzes differences between the current state and the required state
* Corrects the differences through the etcd cluster management APIs, the Kubernetes API, or both

[NOTE]
====
etcd holds the cluster state, which is constantly updated. This state is continuously persisted, which leads to a high number of small changes at high frequency. As a result, it is critical to back up the etcd cluster member with fast, low-latency I/O. For more information about best practices for etcd, see "Recommended etcd practices".
