[role="_abstract"]
Use OVN-Kubernetes network event tracking to monitor and audit network policies, admin network policies, and egress firewall rules in your cluster.

:FeatureName: OVN-Kubernetes networking events tracking
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

You can use the insights from tracking network events to help with the following tasks:

* Network monitoring: Monitor allowed and blocked traffic, detecting whether packets are allowed or blocked based on network policies and admin network policies.

* Network security: You can track outbound traffic and see whether it adheres to egress firewall rules. Detect unauthorized outbound connections and flag outbound traffic that violates egress rules.

See the _Additional resources_ in this section for more information about enabling and working with this view.
