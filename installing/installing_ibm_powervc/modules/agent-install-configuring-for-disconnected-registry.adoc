= Configuring the Agent-based Installer to use mirrored images

You must use the output of either the `oc adm release mirror` command or the oc-mirror plugin to configure the Agent-based Installer to use mirrored images.

.Procedure

. If you used the oc-mirror plugin to mirror your release images:

.. Open the `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` located in the results directory, for example `oc-mirror-workspace/results-1682697932/`.

.. Copy the text in the `repositoryDigestMirrors` section of the yaml file.

. If you used the `oc adm release mirror` command to mirror your release images:

* Copy the text in the `imageContentSources` section of the command output.

. Paste the copied text into the `imageContentSources` field of the `install-config.yaml` file.

. Add the certificate file used for the mirror registry to the `additionalTrustBundle` field of the yaml file.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The value must be the contents of the certificate file that you used for your mirror registry.
The certificate file can be an existing, trusted certificate authority, or the self-signed certificate that you generated for the mirror registry.

.Example `install-config.yaml` file

[source,yaml]
----
  additionalTrustBundle: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----

. If you are using {ztp} manifests: add the `registries.conf` and `ca-bundle.crt` files  to the `mirror` path to add the mirror configuration in the agent ISO image.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can create the `registries.conf` file from the output of either the `oc adm release mirror` command or the `oc mirror` plugin. The format of the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` file has changed. It is now version 2 and in TOML format.
