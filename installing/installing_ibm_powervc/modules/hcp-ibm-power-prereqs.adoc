= Prerequisites to configure {hcp} on {ibm-power-title}

* The {mce} version 2.7 and later installed on an {product-title} cluster. The {mce-short} is automatically installed when you install {rh-rhacm-first}. You can also install the {mce-short} without {rh-rhacm} as an Operator from the {product-title} software catalog.

* The {mce-short} must have at least one managed {product-title} cluster. The `local-cluster` managed hub cluster is automatically imported in the {mce-short} version 2.7 and later. For more information about `local-cluster`, see _Advanced configuration_ in the {rh-rhacm} documentation. You can check the status of your hub cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get managedclusters local-cluster
----

* You need a hosting cluster with at least 3 compute nodes to run the HyperShift Operator.

* You need to enable the central infrastructure management service. For more information, see "Enabling the central infrastructure management service".

* You need to install the hosted control planes command-line interface. For more information, see "Installing the hosted control plane command-line interface".

The {hcp} feature is enabled by default. If you disabled the feature and want to manually enable the feature, see "Manually enabling the {hcp} feature". If you need to disable the feature, see "Disabling the {hcp} feature".
