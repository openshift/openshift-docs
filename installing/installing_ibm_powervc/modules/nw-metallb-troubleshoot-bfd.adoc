= Troubleshooting BFD issues

[role="_abstract"]
To diagnose and resolve Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) issues, execute commands directly within the FRRouting (FRR) container. By accessing the container, you can verify that BFD peers are correctly configured with established BGP sessions.

The BFD implementation that Red{nbsp}Hat supports uses FRRouting (FRR) in a container that exists in a `speaker` pod.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Display the names of the `speaker` pods:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get -n metallb-system pods -l component=speaker
----
+
.Example output
[source,text]
----
NAME            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
speaker-66bth   4/4     Running   0          26m
speaker-gvfnf   4/4     Running   0          26m
...
----

. Display the BFD peers:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -n metallb-system speaker-66bth -c frr -- vtysh -c "show bfd peers brief"
----
+
.Example output
----
Session count: 2
SessionId  LocalAddress              PeerAddress              Status
=========  ============              ===========              ======
3909139637 10.0.1.2                  10.0.2.3                 up
----
+
where:
+
`up`:: Specifies that the `PeerAddress` column includes each BFD peer. If the output does not list a BFD peer IP address that you expected the output to include, troubleshoot BGP connectivity with the peer. If the status field indicates `down`, check for connectivity on the links and equipment between the node and the peer.
You can determine the node name for the speaker pod with a command like `oc get pods -n metallb-system speaker-66bth -o jsonpath='{.spec.nodeName}'`.
