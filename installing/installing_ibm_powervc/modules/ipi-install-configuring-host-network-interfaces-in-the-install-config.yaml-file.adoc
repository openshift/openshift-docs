= Configuring host network interfaces

Before installation, you can set the `networkConfig` configuration setting in the `install-config.yaml` file to use NMState to configure host network interfaces.

The most common use case for this functionality is to specify a static IP address on the bare-metal network, but you can also configure other networks such as a storage network. This functionality supports other NMState features such as VLAN, VXLAN, bridges, bonds, routes, MTU, and DNS resolver settings.

[WARNING]
====
Do not set the unsupported `rotate` option in the DNS resolver settings for your cluster. The option disrupts the DNS resolution function of the internal API.
====

.Prerequisites

* Configure a `PTR` DNS record with a valid hostname for each node with a static IP address.
* Install the NMState CLI (`nmstate`).

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you use a provisioning network, configure it by using the `dnsmasq` tool in Ironic. To do a fully static deployment, you must use virtual media.
====

.Procedure

. Optional: Consider testing the NMState syntax with `nmstatectl gc` before including the syntax in the `install-config.yaml` file, because the installation program does not check the NMState YAML syntax.
+
[NOTE]
====
Errors in the YAML syntax might result in a failure to apply the network configuration. Additionally, maintaining the validated YAML syntax is useful when applying changes by using Kubernetes NMState after deployment or when expanding the cluster.
====
+
.. Create an NMState YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
interfaces: <1>
- name: <nic1_name>
  type: ethernet
  state: up
  ipv4:
    address:
    - ip: <ip_address>
      prefix-length: 24
    enabled: true
dns-resolver:
  config:
    server:
    - <dns_ip_address>
routes:
  config:
  - destination: 0.0.0.0/0
    next-hop-address: <next_hop_ip_address>
    next-hop-interface: <next_hop_nic1_name>
----
+
<1> Replace `<nic1_name>`, `<ip_address>`, `<dns_ip_address>`, `<next_hop_ip_address>` and `<next_hop_nic1_name>` with appropriate values.
+
.. Test the configuration file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ nmstatectl gc <nmstate_yaml_file>
----
+
Replace `<nmstate_yaml_file>` with the configuration file name.

. Use the `networkConfig` configuration setting by adding the NMState configuration to hosts within the `install-config.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: redfish+http://<out_of_band_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
          disableCertificateVerification: null
        bootMACAddress: <NIC1_mac_address>
        bootMode: UEFI
        rootDeviceHints:
          deviceName: "/dev/sda"
        networkConfig: <1>
          interfaces: <2>
          - name: <nic1_name>
            type: ethernet
            state: up
            ipv4:
              address:
              - ip: <ip_address>
                prefix-length: 24
              enabled: true
          dns-resolver:
            config:
              server:
              - <dns_ip_address>
          routes:
            config:
            - destination: 0.0.0.0/0
              next-hop-address: <next_hop_ip_address>
              next-hop-interface: <next_hop_nic1_name>
----
<1> Add the NMState YAML syntax to configure the host interfaces.
<2> Replace `<nic1_name>`, `<ip_address>`, `<dns_ip_address>`, `<next_hop_ip_address>` and `<next_hop_nic1_name>` with appropriate values.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
After deploying the cluster, you cannot modify the `networkConfig` configuration setting of `install-config.yaml` file to make changes to the host network interface. Use the Kubernetes NMState Operator to make changes to the host network interface after deployment.
