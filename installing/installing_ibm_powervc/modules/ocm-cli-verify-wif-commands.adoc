= Verifying a Workload Identity Federation configuration

[role="_abstract"]
You can verify that the configuration of resources associated with a WIF configuration are correct by running the `ocm gcp verify wif-config` command. If a misconfiguration is found, the output provides details about the misconfiguration and recommends that you update the WIF configuration.

You need the name and ID of the WIF configuration you want to verify before verification.
To obtain the name and ID of your active WIF configurations, run the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ ocm gcp list wif-configs
----

To determine if the WIF configuration you want to verify is configured correctly, run the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ ocm gcp verify wif-config <wif_config_name>|<wif_config_id> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<wif_config_name>` and `<wif_config_id>` with the name and ID of your WIF configuration, respectively.
