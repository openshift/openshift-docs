= Disabled OAuth resources

[role="_abstract"]
When you enable direct authentication, several OAuth resources are intentionally removed.

Ensure that you do not rely on these removed resources before configuring direct authentication.

The following resources are unavailable when direct authentication is configured:

* OpenShift OAuth server and OpenShift OAuth API server
* User and group APIs (`*.user.openshift.io`)
* OAuth APIs (`*.oauth.openshift.io`)
* OAuth server and client configurations
