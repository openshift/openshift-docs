= Changing the {rh-openstack} compute flavor by using a control plane machine set

You can change the {rh-openstack-first} compute service (Nova) flavor that your control plane machines use by updating the specification in the control plane machine set custom resource.

In {rh-openstack}, flavors define the compute, memory, and storage capacity of computing instances. By increasing or decreasing the flavor size, you can scale your control plane vertically.

.Prerequisites

* Your {rh-openstack} cluster uses a control plane machine set.

.Procedure

. Edit the following line under the `providerSpec` field:
+
[source,yaml]
----
providerSpec:
  value:
# ...
    flavor: m1.xlarge <1>
----
<1> Specify a {rh-openstack} flavor type that has the same base as the existing selection. For example, you can change `m6i.xlarge` to `m6i.2xlarge` or `m6i.4xlarge`. You can choose larger or smaller flavors depending on your vertical scaling needs.

. Save your changes.

After you save your changes, machines are replaced with ones that use the flavor you chose.
