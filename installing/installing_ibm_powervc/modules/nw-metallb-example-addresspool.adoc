= Example address pool configurations

[role="_abstract"]
To precisely allocate IP address ranges for cluster services, configure MetalLB address pools by using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation or hyphenated bounds. Defining these specific ranges ensures that application workloads receive valid IP assignments that align with your existing network infrastructure requirements.

Example of IPv4 and CIDR ranges::

You can specify a range of IP addresses in classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) notation. You can combine CIDR notation with the notation that uses a hyphen to separate lower and upper bounds.

Example of assigning IP addresses::

You can set the `autoAssign` parameter to `false` to prevent MetalLB from automatically assigning IP addresses from the address pool. You can then assign a single IP address or multiple IP addresses from an IP address pool. To assign an IP address, append the `/32` CIDR notation to the target IP address in the `spec.addresses` parameter. This setting ensures that only the specific IP address is available for assignment, leaving non-reserved IP addresses for application use.

[NOTE]
====
When you add a service, you can request a specific IP address from the address pool or you can specify the pool name in an annotation to request any IP address from the pool.
====

Example of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses::

You can add address pools that use IPv4 and IPv6. You can specify multiple ranges in the `addresses` list, just like several IPv4 examples.

How the service is assigned to a single IPv4 address, a single IPv6 address, or both is determined by how you add the service. The `spec.ipFamilies` and `spec.ipFamilyPolicy` parameters control how IP addresses are assigned to the service.

# ...
----
`spec.addresses`: Where `10.0.100.0/28` is the local network IP address followed by the `/28` network prefix.

Example of assigning IP address pools to services or namespaces::

You can assign IP addresses from an `IPAddressPool` to services and namespaces that you specify.

If you assign a service or namespace to more than one IP address pool, MetalLB uses an available IP address from the higher-priority IP address pool. If no IP addresses are available from the assigned IP address pools with a high priority, MetalLB uses available IP addresses from an IP address pool with lower priority or no priority. 

[NOTE]
====
You can use the `matchLabels` label selector, the `matchExpressions` label selector, or both, for the `namespaceSelectors` and `serviceSelectors` specifications. This example demonstrates one label selector for each specification.
