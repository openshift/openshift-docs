= Day 2 Operators in the hub cluster

The management hub cluster relies on a set of Day 2 Operators to provide critical management services and infrastructure.
Use Operator versions that match the set of managed cluster versions in your fleet.

Install Day 2 Operators using {olm-first} and `Subscription` custom resources (CRs).
`Subscription` CRs identify the specific Day 2 Operator to install, the catalog in which the Operator is found, and the appropriate version channel for the Operator.
By default {olm} installs and attempt to keep Operators updated with the latest z-stream version available in the channel.
By default all Subscriptions are set with an `installPlanApproval: Automatic` value.
In this mode, {olm} automatically installs new Operator versions when they are available in the catalog and channel.

[NOTE]
====
Setting `installPlanApproval` to automatic exposes the risk of the Operator being updated outside of defined maintenance windows if the catalog index is updated to include newer Operator versions.
In a disconnected environment where you are building and maintaining a curated set of Operators and versions in the catalog, and if you follow a strategy of creating a new catalog index for updated versions, the risk of the Operators being inadvertently updated is largely removed.
However, if you want to further close this risk, the `Subscription` CRs can be set to `installPlanApproval: Manual` which prevents Operators from being updated without explicit administrator approval.
====

Limits and requirements::
* When upgrading a telco hub cluster, the versions of {product-title} and Operators must meet the requirements of all relevant compatibility matrixes.
