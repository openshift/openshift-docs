[id="virt-hot-unplugging-bridge-network-interface_{context}"]
= Hot unplugging a secondary network interface by using the CLI

[role="_abstract"]
You can remove a secondary network interface from a running virtual machine (VM).

[NOTE]
====
Hot unplugging is not supported for Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) interfaces.
====

.Prerequisites

* Your VM must be running.
* The VM must be created on a cluster running {VirtProductName} 4.14 or later.
* The VM must have a bridge network interface attached.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Using your preferred text editor, edit the `VirtualMachine` manifest file and set the interface state to `absent`. Setting the interface state to `absent` detaches the network interface from the guest, but the interface still exists in the pod.

Example VM configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: vm-fedora
template:
  spec:
    domain:
      devices:
        interfaces:
          - name: defaultnetwork
            masquerade: {}
          # set the interface state to absent 
          - name: <secondary_nic>
            state: absent # <1>
            bridge: {}
    networks:
      - name: defaultnetwork
        pod: {}
      - name: <secondary_nic>
        multus:
          networkName: <nad_name>
# ...
----
<1> Set the interface state to `absent` to detach it from the running VM. Removing the interface details from the VM specification does not hot unplug the secondary network interface.

. Save your changes and exit the editor.

. For the new configuration to take effect, apply the changes by running the following command. Applying the changes triggers automatic VM live migration and removes the interface from the pod.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml

+
where:

<filename>:: Specifies the name of your `VirtualMachine` manifest YAML file.
