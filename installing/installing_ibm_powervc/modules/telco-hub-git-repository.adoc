= Git repository

The telco management hub cluster supports a GitOps-driven methodology for installing and managing the configuration of OpenShift clusters for various telco applications.
This methodology requires an accessible Git repository that serves as the authoritative source of truth for cluster definitions and configuration artifacts.

Red Hat does not offer a commercially supported Git server.
An existing Git server provided in the production environment can be used.
Gitea and Gogs are examples of self-hosted Git servers that you can use.

The Git repository is typically provided in the production network external to the hub cluster.
In a large-scale deployment, multiple hub clusters can use the same Git repository for maintaining the definitions of managed clusters. Using this approach, you can easily review the state of the complete network.
As the source of truth for cluster definitions, the Git repository should be highly available and recoverable in disaster scenarios.

[NOTE]
====
For disaster recovery and multi-hub considerations, run the Git repository separately from the hub cluster.

Limits and requirements::
* A Git repository is required to support the {ztp} functions of the hub cluster, including installation, configuration, and lifecycle management of the managed clusters.
* The Git repository must be accessible from the management cluster.

Engineering considerations::
* The Git repository is used by the GitOps Operator to ensure continuous deployment and a single source of truth for the applied configuration.
