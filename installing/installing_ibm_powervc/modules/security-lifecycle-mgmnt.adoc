= Lifecycle management

Upgrades are critical for security. When a vulnerability is discovered, it is patched in the latest z-stream release. This fix is then rolled back through each lower y-stream release until all supported versions are patched. Releases that are no longer supported do not receive patches. Therefore, it is important to upgrade {product-title} clusters regularly to stay within a supported release and ensure they remain protected against vulnerabilities.

For more information about lifecycle management and upgrades, see "Upgrading {product-title} clusters".
