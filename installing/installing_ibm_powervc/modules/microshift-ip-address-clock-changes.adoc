= IP address changes or clock adjustments

[role="_abstract"]
{microshift-short} depends on device IP addresses and system-wide clock settings to remain consistent during its runtime. However, these settings might occasionally change on edge devices.

For example, DHCP or Network Time Protocol (NTP) updates can change times. When these changes occur, some {microshift-short} components might stop functioning properly. To mitigate this situation, {microshift-short} monitors the IP address and system time and restarts if either setting changes.

The threshold for clock changes is a time change of greater than 10 seconds in either direction. Smaller drifts on regular time adjustments performed by the Network Time Protocol (NTP) service do not cause a restart.
