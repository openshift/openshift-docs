The Google Cloud Exporter sends telemetry data to Google Cloud Operations Suite. Using the Google Cloud Exporter, you can export metrics to Google Cloud Monitoring, logs to Google Cloud Logging, and traces to Google Cloud Trace.

<1> The `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable that points to the authentication `key.json` file. The `key.json` file is mounted as a secret volume to the OpenTelemetry Collector.

By default, the exporter sends telemetry data to the project specified in the `project` field of the exporter's configuration. You can have an override set up on a per-metric basis by using the `gcp.project.id` resource attribute. For example, if a metric has a label project, you can use the Group-by-Attributes Processor to promote it to a resource label, and then use the Resource Processor to rename the attribute from `project` to `gcp.project.id`.
