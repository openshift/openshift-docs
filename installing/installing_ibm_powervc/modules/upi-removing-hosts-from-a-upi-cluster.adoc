= Removing hosts from a user-provisioned cluster by using the BMO

You can use the Bare Metal Operator (BMO) to remove bare-metal hosts from a user-provisioned cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You created a user-provisioned bare-metal cluster.
* You have baseboard management controller (BMC) access to the hosts.
* You deployed a provisioning service in the cluster by creating a `Provisioning` CR.

.Procedure

. Cordon and drain the node by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm drain app1 --force --ignore-daemonsets=true
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
node/app1 cordoned

. Delete the `customDeploy` specification from the `BareMetalHost` CR.

.. Edit the `BareMetalHost` CR for the host by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit bmh -n openshift-machine-api <host_name>
----

.. Delete the lines `spec.customDeploy` and `spec.customDeploy.method`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
...
  customDeploy:
    method: install_coreos
----

.. Verify that the provisioning state of the host changes to `deprovisioning` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get bmh -A
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAMESPACE               NAME          STATE                    CONSUMER   ONLINE   ERROR   AGE
openshift-machine-api   controller1   externally provisioned              true             58m
openshift-machine-api   worker1       deprovisioning                      true             57m
----

. Delete the host by running the following command when the `BareMetalHost` state changes to `available`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete bmh -n openshift-machine-api <bmh_name>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You can run this step without having to edit the `BareMetalHost` CR. It might take some time for the `BareMetalHost` state to change from `deprovisioning` to `available`. 
====

. Delete the node by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete node <node_name>
----

.Verification

* Verify that you deleted the node by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
