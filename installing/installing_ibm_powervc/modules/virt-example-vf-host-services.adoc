= Example: Node network configuration policy for virtual functions

[role="_abstract"]
You can update host network settings for Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) network virtual functions (VF) in an existing cluster by applying a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` manifest.

You can apply a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` manifest to an existing cluster to complete the following tasks:

* Configure QoS host network settings for VFs to optimize performance.
* Add, remove, or update VFs for a network interface.
* Manage VF bonding configurations.

[NOTE]
====
To update host network settings for SR-IOV VFs by using NMState on physical functions that are also managed through the SR-IOV Network Operator, you must set the `externallyManaged` parameter in the relevant `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` resource to `true`. For more information, see the _Additional resources_ section.
====

The following YAML file is an example of a manifest that defines QoS policies for a VF.
This YAML includes samples values that you must replace with your own information.

<1> Name of the policy.
<2> Optional: If you do not include the `nodeSelector` parameter, the policy applies to all nodes in the cluster.
<3> This example applies to all nodes with the `worker` role.
<4> Name of the physical function (PF) network interface.
<5> Optional: Human-readable description of the interface.
<6> The type of interface.
<7> The requested state for the interface after configuration.
<8> The total number of VFs.
<9> Identifies the VF with an ID of `0`.
<10> Sets a maximum transmission rate, in Mbps, for the VF. This sample value sets a rate of 200 Mbps.

The following YAML file is an example of a manifest that adds a VF for a network interface. 

In this sample configuration, the `ens1f1v0` VF is created on the `ens1f1` physical interface, and this VF is added to a bonded network interface `bond0`. The bond uses `active-backup` mode for redundancy. In this example, the VF is configured to use hardware offloading to manage the VLAN directly on the physical interface.
