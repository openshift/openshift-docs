= Machine CIDR

[role="_abstract"]
To establish the network scope for cluster nodes in {product-title}, specify an IP address range in the Machine Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) parameter. Defining this range ensures that all machines within the environment have valid, routable addresses for internal cluster communication.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot change Machine CIDR ranges after you create your cluster.

This range must encompass all CIDR address ranges for your virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets. Subnets must be contiguous. A minimum range of 128 IP addresses, using the subnet prefix `/25`, is supported for single availability zone deployments. A minimum address range of 256 addresses, using the subnet prefix `/24`, is supported for deployments that use multiple availability zones.
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-rosa-hcp,openshift-dedicated[]

The default is `10.0.0.0/16`. This range must not conflict with any connected networks.

[NOTE]
====
When using {product-title}, the static IP address `172.20.0.1` is reserved for the internal Kubernetes API address. The machine, pod, and service CIDR ranges must not conflict with this IP address.
