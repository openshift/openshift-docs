=  Enhancing the {product-title} web console with Operators

[role="_abstract"]
Cluster administrators can install Operators on clusters in the {product-title} web console by using the software catalog to provide customization outside of layered products for developers. For example, the Web Terminal Operator allows you to start a web terminal in your browser with common CLI tools for interacting with the cluster.
