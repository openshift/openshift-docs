= Additional custom security groups

[role="_abstract"]
During cluster creation, you can add additional custom security groups to a cluster that has an existing non-managed VPC. To do so, complete these prerequisites before you create the cluster:

* Create the custom security groups in AWS before you create the cluster.
* Associate the custom security groups with the VPC that you are using to create the cluster. Do not associate the custom security groups with any other VPC.
* You may need to request additional AWS quota for `Security groups per network interface`.
