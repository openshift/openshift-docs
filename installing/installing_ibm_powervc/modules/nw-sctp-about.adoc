= Support for SCTP on {product-title}

As a cluster administrator, you can enable SCTP on the hosts in the cluster. On {op-system-first}, the SCTP module is disabled by default.

SCTP is a reliable message based protocol that runs on top of an IP network.

When enabled, you can use SCTP as a protocol with pods, services, and network policy.
A `Service` object must be defined with the `type` parameter set to either the `ClusterIP` or `NodePort` value.

== Example configurations using SCTP protocol

You can configure a pod or service to use SCTP by setting the `protocol` parameter to the `SCTP` value in the pod or service object.

In the following example, a pod is configured to use SCTP:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  namespace: project1
  name: example-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: example-pod
...
      ports:
        - containerPort: 30100
          name: sctpserver
          protocol: SCTP
----

In the following example, a service is configured to use SCTP:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  namespace: project1
  name: sctpserver
spec:
...
  ports:
    - name: sctpserver
      protocol: SCTP
      port: 30100
      targetPort: 30100
  type: ClusterIP
----

In the following example, a `NetworkPolicy` object is configured to apply to SCTP network traffic on port `80` from any pods with a specific label:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-sctp-on-http
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: web
  ingress:
  - ports:
    - protocol: SCTP
      port: 80
