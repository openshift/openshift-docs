= Beginning the cluster installation and generating the Discovery ISO

[role="_abstract"]
Begin installing the {product-title} cluster in the {oda-first} environment by using the {hybrid-console}.

.Procedure

. Log in to the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/cluster-list[{hybrid-console}].

. On the *Cluster List* page, click *Create cluster*.

. Click the *Datacenter* tab.

. Under *Assisted Installer*, click *Create cluster*.

. Configure your cluster on the *Cluster details* page:

.. Enter a name for the cluster in the *Cluster name* field.

.. Enter a base domain for the cluster in the *Base domain* field.
All subdomains for the cluster will use this base domain.
+
[NOTE]
====
The base domain must be a valid DNS name.
You must not have a wildcard domain set up for the base domain.
====

.. Select a version from the *OpenShift version* dropdown list.
By default, the dropdown list displays the latest version.

.. Optional: In the *Number of control plane nodes* field, select the number of control plane nodes for your installation from the dropdown menu.
The default value is `3`.

.. Optional: Select the *Include custom manifests* checkbox if you want to upload custom manifests to further configure your cluster.
This option adds an additional page for custom manifests that you use later in the configuration process.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have already added custom manifests, clearing the *Include custom manifests* checkbox automatically deletes them all.
You must confirm the deletion.
====

.. Click *Next* to continue.
Once you proceed to the next page, you cannot go back to change any of these cluster details.

. Choose additional Operators to install on the *Operators* page:

.. If you want to install an Operator bundle, select an option in the *Bundles* section.

.. If you want to install only some Operators, select the individual Operators from the *Single Operators* section.

.. Click *Next* to continue.

. Upload an SSH public key and generate the Discovery ISO:

.. Click the *Add Hosts* button in the *Host Discovery* page.

.. Upload an SSH public key in the *SSH public key* section so that you can connect to the cluster nodes as the `core` user.
If you do not already have an SSH public key, see "Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access" for more information.

.. Select *Show proxy settings*.

.. Enter values for the *HTTP proxy URL*, *HTTPS URL proxy*, and *No proxy domains* fields.

.. Click *Generate Discovery ISO*.

. Copy the command from the *Command to download the ISO* field and run the command as a root user in the {oda-short} environment.
