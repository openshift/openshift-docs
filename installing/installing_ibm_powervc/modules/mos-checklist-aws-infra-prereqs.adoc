//TODO OSDOCS-11789: Moved quota check to the point where it is actually useful - yes, this is checked during install, but it's also worth checking ahead of time so that any issues are known during preparation rather than deployment.

[role="_abstract"]
Before you create your cluster, you need to have sufficient AWS quota.

.Procedure
* To verify that your AWS account has sufficient quota available to deploy a cluster, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa verify quota
----
+
This command only checks the total quota allocated to your account; it does not reflect the amount of quota already consumed from that quota. Running this command is optional because your quota is verified during cluster deployment. However, Red{nbsp}Hat recommends running this command to confirm your quota ahead of time so that deployment is not interrupted by issues with quota availability.
