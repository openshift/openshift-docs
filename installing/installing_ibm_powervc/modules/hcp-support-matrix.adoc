[id="hcp-support-matrix_{context}"]
= Support matrix for {hcp}

Because {mce} includes the HyperShift Operator, releases of {hcp} align with releases of {mce-short}. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift_operators[OpenShift Operator Life Cycles].

[id="hcp-matrix-mgmt_{context}"]
== Management cluster support

Any supported standalone {product-title} cluster can be a management cluster.

[NOTE]
====
A single-node {product-title} cluster is not supported as a management cluster. If you have resource constraints, you can share infrastructure between a standalone {product-title} control plane and {hcp}. For more information, see "Shared infrastructure between hosted and standalone control planes".
====

The following table maps {mce-short} versions to the management cluster versions that support them:

[id="hcp-matrix-hc_{context}"]
== Hosted cluster support

For hosted clusters, no direct relationship exists between the management cluster version and the hosted cluster version. The hosted cluster version depends on the HyperShift Operator that is included with your {mce-short} version.

[NOTE]
====
Ensure a maximum latency of 200 ms between the management cluster and hosted clusters. This requirement is especially important for mixed infrastructure deployments, such as when your management cluster is on {aws-short} and your compute nodes are on-premise.
====

The following table shows the hosted cluster versions that you can create by using the HyperShift Operator that is associated with a version of {mce-short}:

[NOTE]
====
Although the HyperShift Operator supports the hosted cluster versions in the following table, {mce-short} supports only as far back as 2 versions earlier than the current version. For example, if the current hosted cluster version is 4.20, {mce-short} supports as far back as version 4.18. If you want to use a hosted cluster version that is earlier than one of the versions that {mce-short} supports, you can detach your hosted clusters from {mce-short} to be unmanaged, or you can use an earlier version of {mce-short}. For instructions to detach your hosted clusters from {mce-short}, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.13/html/clusters/cluster_mce_overview#remove-managed-cluster[Removing a cluster from management] ({rh-rhacm} documentation). For more information about {mce-short} support, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7120837[The multicluster engine for Kubernetes operator 2.10 Support Matrix] (Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledgebase).

[id="hcp-matrix-platform_{context}"]
== Hosted cluster platform support

A hosted cluster supports only one infrastructure platform. For example, you cannot create multiple node pools on different infrastructure platforms.

The following table indicates which {product-title} versions are supported for each platform of {hcp}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For {ibm-power-title} and {ibm-z-title}:

* You must run the control plane on machine types that are based on 64-bit x86 architecture or s390x architecture
* You must run node pools on {ibm-power-title} or {ibm-z-title}
====

In the following table, the management cluster version is the {product-title} version where the {mce-short} is enabled:

[id="hcp-matrix-updates_{context}"]
== Updates of {mce-short}

When you update to another version of the {mce-short}, your hosted cluster can continue to run if the HyperShift Operator that is included in the version of {mce-short} supports the hosted cluster version. The following table shows which hosted cluster versions are supported on which updated {mce-short} versions.

[NOTE]
====
Although the HyperShift Operator supports the hosted cluster versions in the following table, {mce-short} supports only as far back as 2 versions earlier than the current version. For example, if the current hosted cluster version is 4.20, {mce-short} supports as far back as version 4.18. If you want to use a hosted cluster version that is earlier than one of the versions that {mce-short} supports, you can detach your hosted clusters from {mce-short} to be unmanaged, or you can use an earlier version of {mce-short}. For instructions to detach your hosted clusters from {mce-short}, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.13/html/clusters/cluster_mce_overview#remove-managed-cluster[Removing a cluster from management] ({rh-rhacm} documentation). For more information about {mce-short} support, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7120837[The multicluster engine for Kubernetes operator 2.10 Support Matrix] (Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledgebase).

.Updated {mce-short} version support for hosted clusters
[cols="2",options="header"]
|===
|Updated {mce-short} version |Supported hosted cluster version

|Updated from 2.5 to 2.6
|{product-title} 4.14 - 4.15

|Updated from 2.6 to 2.7
|{product-title} 4.14 - 4.16

|Updated from 2.7 to 2.8
|{product-title} 4.14 - 4.17

|Updated from 2.8 to 2.9
|{product-title} 4.14 - 4.18

|Updated from 2.9 to 2.10
|{product-title} 4.14 - 4.19
|===

For example, if you have an {product-title} 4.18 hosted cluster on the management cluster and you update from {mce-short} 2.8 to 2.9, the hosted cluster can continue to run.
