= About the {external-secrets-operator} stable-v1 channel

[role="_abstract"]
Select the `stable-v1` channel to install and update the latest release of the {external-secrets-operator}. By selecting this channel, you can use the most recent stable release for your Operator.

[NOTE]
====
The `stable-v1` channel is the default and suggested channel while installing the {external-secrets-operator}.
====

The `stable-v1` channel offers the following update approval strategies:

Automatic:: If you choose automatic updates for an installed {external-secrets-operator}, a new version of the {external-secrets-operator} is available in the `stable-v1` channel. The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator without human intervention.

Manual:: If you select manual updates, when a newer version of the {external-secrets-operator} is available, OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve that update request to have the {cert-manager-operator} updated to the new version.
