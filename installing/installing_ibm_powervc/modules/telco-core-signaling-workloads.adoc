= Signaling workloads
Signaling workloads typically use SCTP, REST, gRPC, or similar TCP or UDP protocols.
Signaling workloads support hundreds of thousands of transactions per second (TPS) by using a secondary multus CNI configured as MACVLAN or SR-IOV interface.
These workloads can run in pods with either guaranteed or burstable QoS.
