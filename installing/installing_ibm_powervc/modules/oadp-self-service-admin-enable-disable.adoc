= Enabling and disabling {oadp-short} Self-Service

[role="_abstract"]
Enable or disable the {oadp-short} Self-Service feature to allow namespace administrators to manage their own backup and restore operations without cluster admin privileges. This helps you delegate backup responsibilities while maintaining administrative control.

[NOTE]
====
You can install only one instance of the `NonAdminController` (NAC) CR in the cluster. If you install multiple instances of the NAC CR, you get the following error:

[source,terminal]
----
message: only a single instance of Non-Admin Controller can be installed across the entire cluster. Non-Admin controller is already configured and installed in openshift-adp namespace.
----
====

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the cluster with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the {oadp-short} Operator.
* You have configured the DPA.

.Procedure

* To enable {oadp-short} Self-Service, edit the DPA CR to configure the `nonAdmin.enable` section. See the following example configuration:

.Verification

* To verify that the `NonAdminController` (NAC) pod is running in the {oadp-short} namespace, run the following command:
