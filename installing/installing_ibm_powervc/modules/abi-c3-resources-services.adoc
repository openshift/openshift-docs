= Creating {oci} infrastructure resources and services

You must create an {oci-edge-no-rt} environment on your virtual machine (VM) shape. By creating this environment, you can install {product-title} and deploy a cluster on an infrastructure that supports a wide range of cloud options and strong security policies. Having prior knowledge of {oci-first-no-rt} components can help you with understanding the concept of {oci} resources and how you can configure them to meet your organizational needs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To ensure compatibility with {product-title}, you must set `A` as the record type for each DNS record and name records as follows:

* `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, which targets the `apiVIP` parameter of the API load balancer
* `api-int.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, which targets the `apiVIP` parameter of the API load balancer
* `*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, which targets the `ingressVIP` parameter of the Ingress load balancer

The `api.{asterisk}` and `api-int.{asterisk}` DNS records relate to control plane machines, so you must ensure that all nodes in your installed {product-title} cluster can access these DNS records.

.Prerequisites

* You configured an {oci} account to host the {product-title} cluster.
