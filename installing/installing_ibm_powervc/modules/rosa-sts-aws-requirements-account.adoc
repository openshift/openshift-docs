You must have an AWS account with the following considerations to deploy a {product-title} cluster.

* Your AWS account must allow sufficient quota to deploy your cluster.
* If your organization applies and enforces SCP policies, these policies must not be more restrictive than the roles and policies required by the cluster.
* You can deploy native AWS services within the same AWS account.
* Your account must have a service-linked role to allow the installation program to configure Elastic Load Balancing (ELB). See "Creating the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service-linked role" for more information.
