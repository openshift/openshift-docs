= About using Operators with a {microshift-short} node

[role="_abstract"]
You can use Operators to manage applications and their resources, such as deploying a database or message bus.

Operators offer a more localized configuration experience and integrate with Kubernetes APIs and CLI tools such as `kubectl` and `oc`. You can design or use Operators that are specifically for your applications. By using Operators, you can configure components instead of modifying a global configuration file.

{microshift-short} applications are generally expected to be deployed in static environments. However, Operators are available if helpful in your use case. To discover whether an Operator is compatible with {microshift-short}, check the Operator documentation.
