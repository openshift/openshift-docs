= Applying restrictions on the assignment of an external IP address

[role="_abstract"]
As a cluster administrator, you can specify IP address blocks to allow and to reject IP addresses for a service. Restrictions apply only to users without `cluster-admin` privileges. A cluster administrator can always set the service `spec.externalIPs[]` field to any IP address.

When configuring policy restrictions, the following rules apply:

* If `policy` is set to `{}`, creating a `Service` object with `spec.ExternalIPs[]` results in a failed service. This setting is the default for {product-title}. The same behavior exists for `policy: null`.
* If `policy` is set and either `policy.allowedCIDRs[]` or `policy.rejectedCIDRs[]` is set, the following rules apply:
** If `allowedCIDRs[]` and `rejectedCIDRs[]` are both set, `rejectedCIDRs[]` has precedence over `allowedCIDRs[]`.
** If `allowedCIDRs[]` is set, creating a `Service` object with `spec.ExternalIPs[]` succeeds only if the specified IP addresses are allowed.
** If `rejectedCIDRs[]` is set, creating a `Service` object with `spec.ExternalIPs[]` succeeds only if the specified IP addresses are not rejected.

.Procedure

* Configure an IP address policy by specifying Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) address blocks for the `spec.ExternalIP.policy` parameter in the `policy` object:
