[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} provides a built-in container image registry that runs as a standard workload on the cluster. The registry is configured and managed by an infrastructure Operator. The registry provides an out-of-the-box solution that runs on top of existing cluster infrastructure, so that you can manage the images that run workloads. 

You can scale the registry up or down like any other cluster workload and the registry does not require specific infrastructure provisioning. The registry also integrates into the cluster user authentication and authorization system, which means that defining user permissions on image resources controls access to create and retrieve images.

The registry is typically used as a publication target for images built on the cluster and as a source of images for workloads running on the cluster. When you push a new image to the registry, a notification gets sent to the cluster of the new image so that other components can react to and consume the updated image.

Image data is stored in two locations. The actual image data is stored in a configurable storage location, such as cloud storage or a filesystem volume. The image metadata, which is exposed by the standard cluster APIs and is used to perform access control, is stored as standard API resources, specifically images and image streams.
