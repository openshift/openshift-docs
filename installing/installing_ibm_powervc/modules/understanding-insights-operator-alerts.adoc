= Understanding {insights-operator} alerts

The {insights-operator} declares alerts through the Prometheus monitoring system to the Alertmanager. You can view these alerts in the Alerting UI in the {product-title} web console by using one of the following methods:

* In the *Administrator* perspective, click *Observe* -> *Alerting*.
* In the *Developer* perspective, click *Observe* -> <project_name> -> *Alerts* tab.

Currently, {insights-operator} sends the following alerts when the conditions are met:
