= Built-in Data Mover controller and custom resource definitions (CRDs)

[role="_abstract"]
Review the custom resource definitions (CRDs) that the built-in Data Mover uses to manage volume snapshot backup and restore operations. This helps you understand how Data Mover handles data upload, download, and repository management.

The built-in Data Mover feature introduces three new API objects defined as CRDs for managing backup and restore:

* `DataDownload`: Represents a data download of a volume snapshot. The CSI plugin creates one `DataDownload` object per volume to be restored. The `DataDownload` CR includes information about the target volume, the specified Data Mover, the progress of the current data download, the specified backup repository, and the result of the current data download after the process is complete.

* `DataUpload`: Represents a data upload of a volume snapshot. The CSI plugin creates one `DataUpload` object per CSI snapshot. The `DataUpload` CR includes information about the specified snapshot, the specified Data Mover, the specified backup repository, the progress of the current data upload, and the result of the current data upload after the process is complete.

* `BackupRepository`: Represents and manages the lifecycle of the backup repositories. {oadp-short} creates a backup repository per namespace when the first CSI snapshot backup or restore for a namespace is requested.
