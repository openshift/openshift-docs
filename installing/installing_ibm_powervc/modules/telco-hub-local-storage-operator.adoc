= Local Storage Operator

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
You can create persistent volumes that can be used as `PVC` resources by applications with the Local Storage Operator.
The number and type of `PV` resources that you create depends on your requirements.

Engineering considerations::
* Create backing storage for `PV` CRs before creating the persistent volume.
This can be a partition, a local volume, LVM volume, or full disk.
* Refer to the device listing in `LocalVolume` CRs by the hardware path used to access each device to ensure correct allocation of disks and partitions, for example, `/dev/disk/by-path/<id>`.
Logical names (for example, `/dev/sda`) are not guaranteed to be consistent across node reboots.
