= Preparing to make application RPMs

To build your own RPMs, choose a tool of your choice, such as the `rpmbuild` tool, and initialize the RPM build tree in your home directory. The following is an example procedure. If your RPMs are accessible to image builder, you can use the method you prefer to build the application RPMs.

.Prerequisites

* You have set up a {op-system-ostree-first} {op-system-version} build host that meets the image builder system requirements.
* You have root access to the host.

.Procedure

. Install the `rpmbuild` tool and create the yum repository for it by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo dnf install rpmdevtools rpmlint yum-utils createrepo
----

. Create the file tree you need to build RPM packages by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rpmdev-setuptree
----

.Verification

* List the directories to confirm creation by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ls ~/rpmbuild/
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
