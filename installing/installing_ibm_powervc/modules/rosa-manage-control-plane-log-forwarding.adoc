= Managing control plane log forwarding 

[role="_abstract"]
After you configure the {product-title} clusters to use your selected log forwarder for control plane logs, see the following commands to run based on your specific needs. For all of these commands, you must provide the `clusterid` or cluster name in the `--cluster` flag:

`rosa create log-forwarder -c <cluster_name|cluster_id>`:: Configures your {product-title} cluster to use the log forwarder. 
`rosa list log-forwarder -c <cluster_name|cluster_id>`:: Displays all of the log forwarder configurations for a {product-title} cluster.
`rosa describe log-forwarder -c <cluster_name|cluster_id> <log-fwd-id>`::  Provides more than the basic details for that specific log forwarder. 
`rosa edit log-forwarder -c <cluster_name|cluster_id> <log-fwd-id>`:: Enables you to make changes to the log forwarder. With the edit functionality, you can make changes to the following log forwarder fields: groups, applications, and S3 and CloudWatch configurations, depending on type of configuration.  
`rosa delete log-forwarder -c <cluster_name|cluster_id> <log-fwd-id>`:: Deletes the log forwarder configuration which stops your logs from being forwarded to your chosen destinations. Your logs are not automatically deleted. If you no longer want to store your logs in the S3 bucket or CloudWatch group, you can delete those specific logs. To make changes to the following log forwarder fields, use the delete functionality, then recreate these log forwarder fields, implementing your changes: ID, cluster ID, and the type for S3 and CloudWatch.
