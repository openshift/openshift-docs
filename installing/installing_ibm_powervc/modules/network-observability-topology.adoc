= Observing the network traffic from the Topology view

[role="_abstract"]
The *Topology* view in the *Network Traffic* page provides a graphical representation of network flows and traffic volume across your {product-title} cluster. As an administrator, you can use this view to monitor application traffic data and visualize the relationships between various network components.

The visualization represents network entities as nodes and traffic flows as edges. By selecting individual components within the graph, you can access a side panel containing specific metrics and health details for that resource. This interactive approach allows for rapid identification of traffic patterns and connectivity issues within the cluster.

To manage complex environments, the *Topology* view includes advanced configuration options that allow you to customize the layout and data density. You can adjust the *Scope* of the view, apply *Groups* to represent resource ownership, and choose different *Layout* algorithms to optimize the graphical display. Additionally, you can enable *Edge labels* to show real-time measurements, such as the average byte rate, directly on the flow lines.

For reporting or external analysis, the *Topology* view provides an export feature. You can download the current graphical representation as a PNG image or generate a direct link to the specific view configuration to share with other administrators. These tools ensure that network insights are both accessible and easily documented.
