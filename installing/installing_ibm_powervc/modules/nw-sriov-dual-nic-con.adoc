= NIC partitioning for SR-IOV devices

{product-title} can be deployed on a server with a dual port network interface card (NIC).
You can partition a single, high-speed dual port NIC into multiple virtual functions (VFs) and enable SR-IOV.

This feature supports the use of bonds for high availability with the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP).

[NOTE]
====
Only one LACP can be declared by physical NIC.
====

An {product-title} cluster can be deployed on a bond interface with 2 VFs on 2 physical functions (PFs) using the following methods:

* Agent-based installer
