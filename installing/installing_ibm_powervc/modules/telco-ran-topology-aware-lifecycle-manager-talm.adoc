New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
{cgu-operator} is an Operator that runs only on the hub cluster for managing how changes like cluster upgrades, Operator upgrades, and cluster configuration are rolled out to the network.
{cgu-operator} supports the following features:

* Progressive rollout of policy updates to fleets of clusters in user configurable batches.
* Per-cluster actions add `ztp-done` labels or other user-configurable labels following configuration changes to managed clusters.
* Precaching of {sno} clusters images: {cgu-operator} supports optional pre-caching of OpenShift, OLM Operator, and additional user images to {sno} clusters before initiating an upgrade.
The precaching feature is not applicable when using the recommended image-based upgrade method for upgrading {sno} clusters.
** Specifying optional pre-caching configurations with `PreCachingConfig` CRs.
Review the link:https://github.com/openshift-kni/cluster-group-upgrades-operator/blob/main/config/pre-cache/precachingconfig.yaml[sample reference `PreCachingConfig` CR] for more information.
** Excluding unused images with configurable filtering.
** Enabling before and after pre-caching storage space validations with configurable space-required parameters.

Limits and requirements::
* Supports concurrent cluster deployment in batches of 400
* Pre-caching and backup are limited to {sno} clusters only

Engineering considerations::
* The `PreCachingConfig` CR is optional and does not need to be created if you only need to precache platform-related OpenShift and OLM Operator images.
* The `PreCachingConfig` CR must be applied before referencing it in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR.
* Only policies with the `ran.openshift.io/ztp-deploy-wave` annotation are automatically applied by {cgu-operator} during cluster installation.
* Any policy can be remediated by {cgu-operator} under control of a user created `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR.
