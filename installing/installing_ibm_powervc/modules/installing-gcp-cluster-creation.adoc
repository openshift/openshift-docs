= Configuring user-defined labels and tags for {gcp-short}

Configuring user-defined labels and tags for {gcp-full} means that you can apply key-value pairs to your cloud resources for the purposes of organizing, managing, and automating your infrastructure.

.Prerequisites

* The installation program requires that a service account includes a `TagUser` role, so that the program can create the {product-title} cluster with defined tags at both organization and project levels.

.Procedure

* Update the `install-config.yaml` file to define the list of required labels and tags.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you set labels and tags during creation of the `install-config.yaml` configuration file, you cannot create new or update existing labels and tags after creation of the cluster.
