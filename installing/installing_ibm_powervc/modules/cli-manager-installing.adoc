= Installing the {cli-manager}

You can install the {cli-manager} to facilitate adding CLI plugins in both connected and disconnected environments.

Krew always works with {oc-first} without the {cli-manager} installed. You can use the same commands outlined in this documentation to use Krew with `oc`. For more information, see link:https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/docs/[Krew documentation].
