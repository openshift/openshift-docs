= Removing a secondary NetworkAttachmentDefinition custom resource

[role="_abstract"]
To clean up unused network configurations or free up network resources in {product-title}, you can remove a secondary `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CR. Edit the Cluster Network Operator CR and delete the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CR to remove the secondary network from your cluster.

When a secondary network is removed from the cluster, it is not removed from any pods that it is attached to.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Edit the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) in your default text editor by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit networks.operator.openshift.io cluster
----

. Modify the custom resource (CR) by removing the configuration that the CNO created from the `additionalNetworks` collection for the secondary network that you want to remove.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  additionalNetworks: []
----
+
--
where:

`additionalNetworks`:: Specifies the secondary network attachment definition that you want to remove from the `additionalNetworks` collection. If you are removing the configuration mapping for the only secondary network attachment definition in the `additionalNetworks` collection, you must specify an empty collection.
--

. Remove the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CR from the network of your cluster by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete net-attach-def <name_of_network_attachment_definition>
----
+
Replace `<name_of_network_attachment_definition>` with the name of the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CR that you want to remove.

. Save your changes and quit the text editor to commit your changes.

. Optional: Confirm that the secondary network CR was deleted by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get network-attachment-definition --all-namespaces
----
