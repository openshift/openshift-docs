= Network observability release notes 1.4.0 known issues

[role="_abstract"]
You can review the following known issues in the Network Observability Operator 1.4.0 release.

* Since the 1.2.0 release of the Network Observability Operator, using {loki-op} 5.6, a Loki certificate change periodically affects the `flowlogs-pipeline` pods and results in dropped flows rather than flows written to Loki. The problem self-corrects after some time, but it still causes temporary flow data loss during the Loki certificate change. This issue has only been observed in large-scale environments of 120 nodes or greater. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-980[*NETOBSERV-980*])

* Currently, when `spec.agent.ebpf.features` includes DNSTracking, larger DNS packets require the `eBPF` agent to look for DNS header outside of the 1st socket buffer (SKB) segment. A new `eBPF` agent helper function needs to be implemented to support it. Currently, there is no workaround for this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1304[*NETOBSERV-1304*])

* Currently, when `spec.agent.ebpf.features` includes DNSTracking, DNS over TCP packets requires the `eBPF` agent to look for DNS header outside of the 1st SKB segment. A new `eBPF` agent helper function needs to be implemented to support it. Currently, there is no workaround for this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1245[*NETOBSERV-1245*])

* Currently, when using a `KAFKA` deployment model, if conversation tracking is configured, conversation events might be duplicated across Kafka consumers, resulting in inconsistent tracking of conversations, and incorrect volumetric data. For that reason, it is not recommended to configure conversation tracking when `deploymentModel` is set to `KAFKA`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-926[*NETOBSERV-926*])

* Currently, when the `processor.metrics.server.tls.type` is configured to use a `PROVIDED` certificate, the operator enters an unsteady state that might affect its performance and resource consumption. It is recommended to not use a `PROVIDED` certificate until this issue is resolved, and instead using an auto-generated certificate, setting `processor.metrics.server.tls.type` to `AUTO`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1293)[*NETOBSERV-1293*]

* Since the 1.3.0 release of the Network Observability Operator, installing the Operator causes a warning kernel taint to appear. The reason for this error is that the network observability eBPF agent has memory constraints that prevent preallocating the entire hashmap table. The Operator eBPF agent sets the `BPF_F_NO_PREALLOC` flag so that pre-allocation is disabled when the hashmap is too memory expansive.
