= Network Observability CLI

[role="_abstract"]
The Network Observability CLI (`oc netobserv`) is a lightweight tool that streams flow and packet data for quick, live insight into networking issues without requiring the full Network Observability Operator installation.

The Network Observability CLI is a flow and packet visualization tool that relies on eBPF agents to stream collected data to an ephemeral collector pod. It requires no persistent storage during the capture. After the run, the output is transferred to your local machine. This enables quick, live insight into packets and flow data without installing the Network Observability Operator.
