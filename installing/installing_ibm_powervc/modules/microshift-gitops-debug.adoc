= Debugging {gitops} with oc adm inspect

[role="_abstract"]
If you have problems with your Argo CD for {microshift-short} {gitops-title} controller, you can use the {oc-first} tool to inspect it for errors.

.Prerequisites

.Procedure

* Run the `oc adm inspect` command when in the {gitops} namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm inspect ns/openshift-gitops
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
