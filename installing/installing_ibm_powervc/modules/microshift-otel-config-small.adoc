= Selecting a small configuration

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure {microshift-short} Observability to collect the smallest amount of performance and resource information from various sources by updating the YAML file.

.Procedure

. Select a small configuration by adding the following information to the `/etc/microshift/observability/opentelemetry-collector.yaml` file:
