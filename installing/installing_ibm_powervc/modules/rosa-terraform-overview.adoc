= Overview of Terraform

Terraform is an infrastructure-as-code tool that provides a way to configure your resources once and replicate those resources as desired. Terraform accomplishes the creation tasks by using declarative language. You declare what you want the final state of the infrastructure resource to be, and Terraform creates these resources to your specifications.
