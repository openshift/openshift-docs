[role="_abstract"]
After completing the first y-stream update, you must update the y-stream control plane version to the new EUS version.

.Procedure
. Verify that the <4.y.z> release that you selected is still listed as a good channel to move to:

----
$ oc adm upgrade

Cluster version is 4.15.33

Upgradeable=False

  Reason: AdminAckRequired
  Message: Kubernetes 1.29 and therefore OpenShift 4.16 remove several APIs which require admin consideration. Please see the knowledge article https://access.redhat.com/articles/7031404 for details and instructions.

Upstream is unset, so the cluster will use an appropriate default.
Channel: eus-4.16 (available channels: candidate-4.15, candidate-4.16, eus-4.16, fast-4.15, fast-4.16, stable-4.15, stable-4.16)
