= SPIRE OpenID Connect Discovery Provider

[role="_abstract"]
Use the SPIRE OpenID Connect (OIDC) Discovery Provider to integrate SPIRE workload identities with OIDC-compliant systems. This component exposes endpoints for token verification. It helps ensure compatibility between SPIRE-issued credentials and external APIs requiring standard OIDC tokens.

While SPIRE primarily issues identities for workloads, additional workload-related claims can be embedded into JWT-SVIDs through the configuration of SPIRE, which these claims to be included in the token and verified by OIDC-compliant clients.
