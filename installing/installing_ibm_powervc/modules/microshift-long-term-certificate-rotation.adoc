= Long-term certificates rotation

[role="_abstract"]
Long-term certificates that are expired or close to their expiration dates must be rotated to ensure continued {microshift-short} operation.

The following situations describe {microshift-short} actions during long-term certificate lifetimes:

No rotation::
When a long-term certificate is up to 8.5 years old, no rotation occurs.

Rotation at restart::
When a long-term certificate is 8.5 to 9 years old, it is rotated when {microshift-short} starts or restarts.

Automatic restart for rotation::
When a long-term certificate is more than 9 years old, {microshift-short} might automatically restart so that it can rotate and apply a new certificate.
