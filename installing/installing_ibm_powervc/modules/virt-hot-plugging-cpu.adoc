= Hot plugging CPUs on a virtual machine

[role="_abstract"]
You can increase or decrease the number of CPU sockets allocated to a virtual machine (VM) without having to restart the VM by using the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Virtualization* -> *VirtualMachines*.
. Select the required VM to open the *VirtualMachine details* page.
. On the *Configuration* tab, click *Edit CPU|Memory*.
. Select the *vCPU* radio button.
. Enter the desired number of vCPU sockets and click *Save*.
+
[NOTE]
====
By hot plugging, you can increase the total number of vCPU sockets of a VM up to four times the default initial number. Exceeding this limit requires a restart.
====
+
If the VM is migratable, a live migration is triggered. If not, or if the changes cannot be live-updated, a `RestartRequired` condition is added to the VM.
+
[NOTE]
====
If a VM has the `spec.template.spec.domain.devices.networkInterfaceMultiQueue` field enabled and CPUs are hot plugged, the following behavior occurs:

* Existing network interfaces that you attach before the CPU hot plug retain their original queue count, even after you add more virtual CPUs (vCPUs). The underlying virtualization technology causes this expected behavior.  
* To update the queue count of existing interfaces to match the new vCPU configuration, you can restart the VM. A restart is only necessary if the update improves performance.  
* New VirtIO network interfaces that you hot plugged after the CPU hotplug automatically receive a queue count that matches the updated vCPU configuration.
