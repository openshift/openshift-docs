= Forwarding telemetry data to AWS

[role="_abstract"]
To forward telemetry data to AWS, use the OpenTelemetry Collector with the following exporters: AWS CloudWatch Logs Exporter for logs, AWS EMF Exporter for metrics, and AWS X-Ray Exporter for traces.

// Currently, this docs repository does not permit linking from here to the sections for AWS CloudWatch Logs Exporter, AWS EMF Exporter, and AWS X-Ray Exporter. See the xref to the "Exporters" page placed in observability/otel/otel-forwarding-telemetry-data.adoc.
