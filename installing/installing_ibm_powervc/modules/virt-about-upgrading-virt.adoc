= About updating {VirtProductName}

[role="_abstract"]
When you install {VirtProductName}, you select an update channel and an approval strategy. The update channel determines the versions that {VirtProductName} will be updated to. The approval strategy setting determines whether updates occur automatically or require manual approval.

[NOTE]
====
Both settings can impact supportability.

[id="recommended-settings_{context}"]
== Recommended settings

To maintain a supportable environment, use the following settings:

* Update channel: *stable* 
* Approval strategy: *Automatic* 

With these settings, the update process automatically starts when a new version of the Operator is available in the *stable* channel. This ensures that your {VirtProductName} and {product-title} versions remain compatible, and that your version of {VirtProductName} is suitable for production environments.

[NOTE]
====
Each minor version of {VirtProductName} is supported only if you run the corresponding {product-title} version. For example, you must run {VirtProductName} {VirtVersion} on {product-title} {VirtVersion}.

[id="what-to-expect_{context}"]
== What to expect

You can anticipate update behavior in {VirtProductName}, including duration, automation, and data preservation.

* The amount of time an update takes to complete depends on your network
connection. Most automatic updates complete within fifteen minutes.

* Updating {VirtProductName} does not interrupt network connections.

* Data volumes and their associated persistent volume claims are preserved during an update.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have virtual machines running that use hostpath provisioner storage, they cannot be live migrated and might block an {product-title} cluster update.

As a workaround, you can reconfigure the virtual machines so that they can be powered off automatically during a cluster update. Set the `evictionStrategy` field to `None` and the `runStrategy` field to `Always`.

[id="how-updates-work_{context}"]
== How updates work

Learn how the {VirtProductName} Operator is updated through the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) and how update channels and approval strategies affect upgrade behavior.

* Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) manages the lifecycle of the {VirtProductName} Operator. The Marketplace Operator, which is deployed during {product-title} installation, makes external Operators available to your cluster.

* OLM provides z-stream and minor version updates for {VirtProductName}. Minor version updates become available when you update {product-title} to the next minor version. You cannot update {VirtProductName} to the next minor version without first updating {product-title}.
