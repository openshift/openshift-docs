= TLS certificates

[role="_abstract"]
TLS certificates for {VirtProductName} components are renewed and rotated automatically. You are not required to refresh them manually.

== Automatic renewal schedules

TLS certificates are automatically deleted and replaced according to the following schedule:

* KubeVirt certificates are renewed daily.

* Containerized Data Importer controller (CDI)
 certificates are renewed every 15 days.

* MAC pool certificates are renewed every year.

Automatic TLS certificate rotation does not disrupt any operations. For example, the following operations continue to function without any disruption:

* Migrations

* Image uploads

* VNC and console connections
