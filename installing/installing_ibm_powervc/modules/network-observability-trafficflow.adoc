= Observing the network traffic from the Traffic flows view

[role="_abstract"]
Use the *Traffic flows* view to monitor real-time and historical network communication between cluster components. By analyzing granular flow data collected via eBPF, you can audit network traffic, validate network policies, and export data for external reporting and analysis.

The *Traffic flows* view in the Network Observability Operator provides a granular, tabular representation of network activity across a {product-title} cluster. By leveraging eBPF technology to collect flow data, this view allows administrators to monitor real-time and historical communication between pods, services, and nodes. This visibility is essential for auditing network traffic, validating network policies, and identifying unexpected communication patterns within the cluster infrastructure.

In the *Traffic flows* interface, you can analyze specific connection details by interacting with individual rows to retrieve detailed flow information. The view supports advanced customization through the *Display options* menu, where you can adjust row density and manage columns. By selecting and reordering specific columns, you can tailor the table to highlight the most relevant data points for your environment, such as source and destination endpoints or traffic volume.

To support external analysis and reporting, the *Traffic flows* view includes data export capabilities. You can export the entire dataset or select specific fields to generate a targeted report of network activity. This functionality ensures that network flow data is accessible for long-term auditing or for use in third-party monitoring tools, providing a flexible way to document and analyze the network health of your {product-title} environment.
