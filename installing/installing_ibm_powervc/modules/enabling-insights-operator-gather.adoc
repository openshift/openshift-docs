= Re-enabling the {insights-operator} periodic gather operations

If you disabled the default `InsightsDataGather` data gather operations, you can enable them again so that the {insights-operator} resumes the periodic data collection, and sends the resulting {red-hat-lightspeed} cluster reports to Red{nbsp}Hat.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Administration* > *CustomResourceDefinitions*.
. On the *CustomResourceDefinitions* page, use the *Search by name* field to find the *InsightsDataGather* custom resource definition (CRD), and click to open.
. On the *CustomResourceDefinition details* page, click the *Instances* tab.
. Click *cluster*, and then click the *YAML* tab.
. Edit the `InsightsDataGather` CRD, and complete one of the following steps:

** To enable all disabled gather operations, under the `gatherers` specification, set the `mode` back to *All* as outlined in the following example extract:
+
[source,yaml]
----

apiVersion: insights.openshift.io/v1alpha2
kind: InsightsDataGather
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
# Gatherers configuration
  gatherers:
    mode: All # Options: All, None, Custom
----

** To enable individual gather operations that were previously disabled, find the name of the gatherer operation under the `gatherers:custom:configs` key section and change the `state` to *Enabled*. Alternatively, under the `config` specification, remove the `name` and `state` configuration lines for the operation you want to enable.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: insights.openshift.io/v1alpha2
kind: InsightsDataGather
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
    # Gatherers configuration
  gatherers:
    mode: Custom  # Options: All, None, Custom
    custom:
      configs:
        # Essential cluster configuration gatherers
        - name: clusterconfig/authentication
          state: Enabled
        - name: clusterconfig/clusteroperators
          state: Enabled
        - name: workloads
          state: Enabled
----
+
. Click *Save*.
+
After you save the changes, the {insights-operator} gather configurations are updated and the affected gather operations start.

[NOTE]
====
Disabling gather operations restricts the ability of the {red-hat-lightspeed} advisor service to offer effective recommendations for your cluster.
