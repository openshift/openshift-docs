ifdef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
You
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
can add additional custom security groups during cluster creation. Custom security groups are subject to the following limitations:

* You must create the custom security groups in AWS before you create the cluster. For more information, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html[Amazon EC2 security groups for Linux instances].
* You must associate the custom security groups with the VPC that the cluster will be installed into. Your custom security groups cannot be associated with another VPC.
* You might need to request additional quota for your VPC if you are adding additional custom security groups. For information on AWS quota requirements for {product-title} see _Required AWS service quotas_ in _Prepare your environment_. For information on requesting an AWS quota increase, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html[Requesting a quota increase].
