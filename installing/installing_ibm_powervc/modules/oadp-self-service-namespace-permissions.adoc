[id="oadp-self-service-namespace-permissions_{context}"]
= {oadp-short} Self-Service namespace permissions

[role="_abstract"]
Assign namespace permissions to namespace administrators to create and manage backup, restore, and storage location resources in their assigned namespaces. This grants namespace administrators the required access for Self-Service data protection operations.

As a cluster administrator, ensure that a namespace admin user has editor roles assigned for the following list of objects in their namespace.

* `nonadminbackups.oadp.openshift.io`
* `nonadminbackupstoragelocations.oadp.openshift.io`
* `nonadminrestores.oadp.openshift.io`
* `nonadmindownloadrequests.oadp.openshift.io`

For more details on the namespace `admin` role, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{product-version}/html/authentication_and_authorization/using-rbac#default-roles_using-rbac[Default cluster roles].

A cluster administrator can also define their own specifications so that users can have rights similar to `project` or namespace `admin` roles.
