= Developer role in the web console

[role="_abstract"]
The developer role in the web console offers several built-in ways to deploy applications, services, and databases. With the developer role, you can:

* View real-time visualization of rolling and recreating rollouts on the component.
* View the application status, resource utilization, project event streaming, and quota consumption.
* Share your project with others.
* Troubleshoot problems with your applications by running Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) queries on your project and examining the metrics visualized on a plot. The metrics provide information about the state of a cluster and any user-defined workloads that you are monitoring.

Cluster administrators can also open an embedded command-line terminal instance in the web console in {product-title} 4.7 and later.

Developers have access to workflows specific to their use cases, such as the ability to:

* Create and deploy applications on {product-title} by importing existing codebases, images, and container files.
* Visually interact with applications, components, and services associated with them within a project and monitor their deployment and build status.
* Group components within an application and connect the components within and across applications.
* Integrate serverless capabilities (Technology Preview).
* Create workspaces to edit their application code using Eclipse Che.

You can use the *Topology* view to display applications, components, and workloads of your project. If you have no workloads in the project, the *Topology* view will show some links to create or import them. You can also use the *Quick Search* to import components directly.
