= The {microshift-short} health check script

The `40_microshift_running_check.sh` health check script only performs validation of core {microshift-short} services. Install your customized workload health check scripts in the greenboot directories to ensure successful application operations after system updates. Scripts run in alphabetical order.

{microshift-short} health checks are listed in the following table:

[id="validation-wait-period_{context}"]
== Validation wait period

The wait period in each validation is 10 minutes by default. After the wait period, if the validation has not succeeded, it is declared a failure. This wait period is incrementally increased by the base wait period after each boot in the verification loop.

* You can override the base-time wait period by setting the `MICROSHIFT_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SEC` environment variable in the `/etc/greenboot/greenboot.conf` configuration file. For example, you can change the wait time to 5 minutes by resetting the value to 300 seconds, such as `MICROSHIFT_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SEC=300`.
