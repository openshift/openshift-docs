= Checking OVN-Kubernetes network traffic with OVS sampling using the CLI

:FeatureName: Checking OVN-Kubernetes network traffic with OVS sampling
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

OVN-Kubernetes network traffic can be viewed with OVS sampling via the CLI for the following network APIs: 

* `NetworkPolicy`
* `AdminNetworkPolicy`
* `BaselineNetworkPolicy`
* `UserDefinedNetwork` isolation
* `EgressFirewall`
* Multicast ACLs. 

Scripts for these networking events are found in the `/usr/bin/ovnkube-observ` path of each OVN-Kubernetes node.

Although both the Network Observability Operator and checking OVN-Kubernetes network traffic with OVS sampling are good for debuggability, the Network Observability Operator is intended for observing network events. Alternatively, checking OVN-Kubernetes network traffic with OVS sampling using the CLI is intended to help with packet tracing; it can also be used while the Network Observability Operator is installed, however that is not a requirement.

Administrators can add the `--add-ovs-collect` option to view network traffic across the node, or pass in additional flags to filter result for specific pods. Additional flags can be found in the "OVN-Kubernetes network traffic with OVS sampling flags" section.

Use the following procedure to view OVN-Kubernetes network traffic using the CLI.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have created a source pod and a destination pod and ran traffic between them.
* You have created at least one of the following network APIs: `NetworkPolicy`, `AdminNetworkPolicy`, `BaselineNetworkPolicy`, `UserDefinedNetwork` isolation, multicast, or egress firewalls.

.Procedure

. To enable the `OVNObservability` with OVS sampling feature, enable `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set in the `FeatureGate` CR named `cluster` by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch --type=merge --patch '{"spec": {"featureSet": "TechPreviewNoUpgrade"}}' featuregate/cluster
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
featuregate.config.openshift.io/cluster patched
----

. Confirm that the `OVNObservability` feature is enabled by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get featuregate cluster -o yaml
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,yaml]
----
  featureGates:
# ...
    enabled:
    - name: OVNObservability
----

. Obtain a list of the pods inside of the namespace in which you have created one of the relevant network APIs by entering the following command. Note the `NODE` name of the pods, as they are used in the following step.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n <namespace> -o wide
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----

----

. Obtain a list of OVN-Kubernetes pods and locate the pod that shares the same `NODE` as the pods from the previous step by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-ovn-kubernetes -o wide
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----

...
----

. Open a bash shell inside of the `ovnkube-node` pod by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -it <pod_name> -n openshift-ovn-kubernetes -- bash
----

. While inside of the `ovnkube-node` pod, you can run the `ovnkube-observ -add-ovs-collector` script to show network events using the OVS collector. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# /usr/bin/ovnkube-observ -add-ovs-collector
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
