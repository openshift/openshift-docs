= Removing conflicts between the Gateway API and the OSSM v2.x

[role="_abstract"]
To restore cluster health and resolve operator degradation in {product-title} 4.20 and later, identify and remove conflicts between the Gateway API and OpenShift Service Mesh (OSSM) v2.x. Ensuring these subscriptions do not overlap allows the ingress Cluster Operator to maintain a healthy status when you create a GatewayClass resource.

The conflict occurs because the Gateway API implementation requires OSSM v3.x, which cannot coexist with OSSM v2.x. The CIO detects this conflict, stops the Gateway API provisioning, and reports the `Degraded` status to alert administrators. 

.Prerequisites

Your Cluster Operator reports a status of `True` and a type of `Degraded` with a reason of `GatewayAPIOSSMConflict`. Verify by running the following command: 

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusteroperator ingress -o yaml
----

In the `status` section of the output, look for a `Degraded` condition with `status: "True"` and `reason: GatewayAPIOSSMConflict`.

[source,yaml]
----
status:
  conditions:

    lastTransitionTime: "2025-10-22T17:00:00Z"

    message: 'Failed to install OpenShift Service Mesh 3.x for Gateway API: A
      conflicting OpenShift Service Mesh 2.x subscription was found. Remove the
      GatewayClass resource or the conflicting OSSM 2.x subscription to resolve.'
    reason: GatewayAPIOSSMConflict
    status: "True"
    type: Degraded
----

You can resolve this issue and clear the `Degraded` status either by removing the `GatewayClass` resource or by using OpenShift Gateway API to remove the conflicting OpenShift Service Mesh v2.x subscription from the cluster.

.Procedure

* If you do not intend to use the OpenShift Gateway API, remove the `GatewayClass` resource. This signals to the Ingress Operator to stop attempting to provision Gateway API.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete gatewayclass <gatewayclass-name>
----

* If you do intend to use the OpenShift Gateway API, you must remove the conflicting OpenShift Service Mesh v2.x subscription from the cluster. 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-operators delete subscription <OSSM v2.x subscription name>
----
+
After you remove the v2.x subscription, the Ingress Operator automatically retries the installation of OSSM v3.x and completes the Gateway API provisioning.
