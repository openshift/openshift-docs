== eBPF Manager Operator with network observability

The eBPF Manager Operator reduces the attack surface and ensures compliance, security, and conflict prevention by managing all eBPF programs. Network observability can use the eBPF Manager Operator to load hooks. This eliminates the need to provide the eBPF Agent with privileged mode or additional Linux capabilities like `CAP_BPF` and `CAP_PERFMON`. The eBPF Manager Operator with network observability is only supported on 64-bit AMD architecture.
