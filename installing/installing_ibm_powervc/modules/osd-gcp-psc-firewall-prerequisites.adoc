= {gcp-short} firewall prerequisites

If you are using a firewall to control egress traffic from {product-title} on {GCP}, you must configure your firewall to grant access to certain domains and port combinations listed in the tables below. {product-title} requires this access to provide a fully managed OpenShift service.

// .Prerequisites
// Per SMEs, no prereqs. Will confirm with QE when ticket is reviewed.

.Procedure

. Add the following URLs that are used to install and download packages and tools to an allowlist:

[NOTE]
====
Managed clusters require the enabling of telemetry to allow Red Hat to react more quickly to problems, better support the customers, and better understand how product upgrades impact clusters. For more information about how remote health monitoring data is used by Red Hat, see _About remote health monitoring_ in the _Additional resources_ section.
