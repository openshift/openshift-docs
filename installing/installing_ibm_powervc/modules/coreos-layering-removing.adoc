= Reverting an out-of-cluster node

You can revert an out-of-cluster custom layered image from the nodes in specific machine config pools. The Machine Config Operator (MCO) reboots those nodes with the cluster base {op-system-first} image, overriding the custom layered image.

To remove a {op-system-first} custom layered image from your cluster, you need to delete the machine config that applied the image.

.Procedure

* Delete the machine config that applied the custom layered image.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete mc os-layer-custom
----
+
After deleting the machine config, the nodes reboot.

.Verification

You can verify that the custom layered image is removed by performing any of the following checks:

. Check that the worker machine config pool is updating with the previous machine config:

$ oc get mcp

<1> When the `UPDATING` field is `True`, the machine config pool is updating with the previous machine config. When the field becomes `False`, the worker machine config pool has rolled out to the previous machine config.

. Check the nodes to see that scheduling on the nodes is disabled. This indicates that the change is being applied:

. When the node is back in the `Ready` state, check that the node is using the base image:

.. Open an `oc debug` session to the node by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<node_name>
----

.. Set `/host` as the root directory within the debug shell by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-5.1# chroot /host
----

.. Run the `rpm-ostree status` command to view that the custom layered image is in use:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-5.1# sudo rpm-ostree status
----
