= Installing managed clusters with SiteConfig resources and {rh-rhacm}

{ztp-first} uses `SiteConfig` custom resources (CRs) in a Git repository to manage the processes that install {product-title} clusters. The `SiteConfig` CR contains cluster-specific parameters required for installation. It has options for applying select configuration CRs during installation including user defined extra manifests.

The {ztp} plugin processes `SiteConfig` CRs to generate a collection of CRs on the hub cluster. This triggers the assisted service in {rh-rhacm-first} to install {product-title} on the bare-metal host. You can find installation status and error messages in these CRs on the hub cluster.

You can provision single clusters manually or in batches with {ztp}:

Provisioning a single cluster:: Create a single `SiteConfig` CR and related installation and configuration CRs for the cluster, and apply them in the hub cluster to begin cluster provisioning. This is a good way to test your CRs before deploying on a larger scale.

Provisioning many clusters:: Install managed clusters in batches of up to 400 by defining `SiteConfig` and related CRs in a Git repository. ArgoCD uses the `SiteConfig` CRs to deploy the sites. The {rh-rhacm} policy generator creates the manifests and applies them to the hub cluster. This starts the cluster provisioning process.
