= Using the {gcp-short} Marketplace offering

Using the {gcp-short} Marketplace offering lets you deploy an {product-title} cluster, which is billed on pay-per-use basis (hourly, per core) through {gcp-short}, while still being supported directly by Red{nbsp}Hat.

By default, the installation program downloads and installs the {op-system-first} image that is used to deploy compute machines. To deploy an {product-title} cluster using an {op-system} image from the {gcp-short} Marketplace, override the default behavior by modifying the `install-config.yaml` file to reference the location of {gcp-short} Marketplace offer.

.Prerequisites

* You have an existing `install-config.yaml` file.

.Procedure

. Edit the `compute.platform.gcp.osImage` parameters to specify the location of the {gcp-short} Marketplace image:
** Set the `project` parameter to `redhat-marketplace-public`
** Set the `name` parameter to one of the following offers:
+
{product-title}:: `redhat-coreos-ocp-413-x86-64-202305021736`
{opp}:: `redhat-coreos-opp-413-x86-64-202305021736`
{oke}:: `redhat-coreos-oke-413-x86-64-202305021736`
. Save the file and reference it when deploying the cluster.
