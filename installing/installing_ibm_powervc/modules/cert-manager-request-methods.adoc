= Certificate request methods

[role="_abstract"]
To obtain certificates for your workloads, choose a request method supported by the {cert-manager-operator}. You can select the approach that fits your operational requirements and automation workflow.

There are two ways to request a certificate using the {cert-manager-operator}:

Using the `cert-manager.io/CertificateRequest` object:: With this method a service developer creates a `CertificateRequest` object with a valid `issuerRef` pointing to a configured issuer (configured by a service infrastructure administrator). A service infrastructure administrator then accepts or denies the certificate request. Only accepted certificate requests create a corresponding certificate.

Using the `cert-manager.io/Certificate` object:: With this method, a service developer creates a `Certificate` object with a valid `issuerRef` and obtains a certificate from a secret that they pointed to the `Certificate` object.
