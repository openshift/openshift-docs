= Network Observability Operator 1.10.1 fixed issues

[role="_abstract"]
The Network Observability Operator 1.10.1 release contains several fixed issues that improve performance and the user experience.

Warning Generated for Direct Mode on Clusters Over 15 Nodes::
Before this update, the recommendation against using the `Direct` deployment model on large clusters was only available in the documentation.
+
With this release, the Network Observability Operator now generates a warning when the Direct deployment mode is used on a cluster exceeding 15 nodes.

Network policy deployment disabled on OpenShiftSDN::
Before this update, when OpenShift SDN was the cluster network plugin, enabling the `FlowCollector` network policy would break communication between network observability pods. This issue does not occur with OVN-Kubernetes, which is the default supported network plugin.
+
With this release, the Network Observability Operator no longer attempts to deploy the network policy when OpenShift SDN is detected; a warning is displayed instead. Additionally, the default value for enabling the network policy is modified: it is now enabled by default only when OVN-Kubernetes is detected as the cluster network plugin.

Validation added for subnet label characters::
Before this update, there were no restrictions on characters allowed in the subnet labels "name" configuration, meaning users could enter text containing spaces or special characters. This generated errors in the web console plugin when users tried to apply filters, and clicking the filter icon for a subnet label often failed.
+
With this release, the configured subnet label name is validated immediately when configured in the `FlowCollector` custom resource. The validation ensures the name contains only alphanumeric characters, `:`, `_`, and `-`. As a result, filtering on subnet labels from the web console plugin now works as expected.

Network Observability CLI uses unique temporary directory per run::
Before this update, the Network Observability CLI created or reused a single temporary (`tmp`) directory in the current working directory. This could lead to conflicts or data corruption between separate runs.
+
With this release, the Network Observability CLI now creates a unique temporary directory for each run, preventing potential conflicts and improving file management hygiene.
