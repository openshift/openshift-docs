= {microshift-short} installation tools

To use {microshift-short}, you must already have or plan to install a {op-system-base-full} type, such as on bare metal, or as a virtual machine (VM) that you provision. Although each use case has different details, each installation of {op-system-bundle} uses {op-system-base} tools and the {oc-first}.

You can use RPMs to install {microshift-short} on an existing {op-system-base} machine. You do not need other tools unless you are also installing an image-based {op-system-base} system or VM at the same time.
