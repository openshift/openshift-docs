= About using a custom VPC

ifdef::ibm-powervs-vpc[]
In {product-title} {product-version}, you can deploy a cluster using an existing {ibm-name} Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

Because the installation program cannot know what other components are in your existing subnets, it cannot choose subnet CIDRs and so forth. You must configure networking for the subnets to which you will install the cluster.

You must correctly configure the existing VPC and its subnets before you install the cluster. The installation program does not create a VPC or VPC subnet in this scenario.

The installation program cannot:

* Subdivide network ranges for the cluster to use
* Set route tables for the subnets
* Set VPC options like DHCP

[id="installation-custom-ibm-power-vs-validation_{context}"]
== VPC validation

The VPC and all of the subnets must be in an existing resource group. The cluster is deployed to this resource group.

As part of the installation, specify the following in the `install-config.yaml` file:

* The name of the resource group
* The name of VPC
* The name of the VPC subnet

To ensure that the subnets that you provide are suitable, the installation program confirms that all of the subnets you specify exists.

[NOTE]
====
Subnet IDs are not supported.

[id="installation-custom-ibm-power-vs-isolation_{context}"]
== Isolation between clusters

If you deploy {product-title} to an existing network, the isolation of cluster services is reduced in the following ways:

* ICMP Ingress is allowed to the entire network.

* TCP port 22 Ingress (SSH) is allowed to the entire network.

* Control plane TCP 6443 Ingress (Kubernetes API) is allowed to the entire network.

* Control plane TCP 22623 Ingress (MCS) is allowed to the entire network.
