= Security certificate lifetime

[role="_abstract"]
{microshift-short} certificates are digital certificates that secure communication with communication protocols such as HTTPS. They fall into two basic categories:

Short-lived certificates:: Have a certificate validity of one year. Most server or leaf certificates are short-lived.
Long-lived certificates:: Have a certificate validity of 10 years. An example of a long-lived certificate is the client certificate for `system:admin user` authentication, or the certificate of the signer of the `kube-apiserver` external serving certificate.

{microshift-short} restarts automatically in certain cases, depending on certificate age.
