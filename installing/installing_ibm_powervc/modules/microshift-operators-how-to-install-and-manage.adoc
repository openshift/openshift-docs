= How to use Operators with a {microshift-short} node

[role="_abstract"]
There are two ways to install and manage Operators for your {microshift-short} node. You can use manifests or Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

[id="microshift-operators-paths-manifests_{context}"]
== Manifests for Operators

You can install and manage Operators directly by using manifests. You can use the `kustomize` configuration management tool with {microshift-short} to deploy an application. Use the same steps to install Operators with manifests. For more information, see the following links:

[id="microshift-operators-paths-olm_{context}"]
== Operator Lifecycle Manager for Operators

You can also install add-on Operators to a {microshift-short} node by using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). OLM can be used to manage both custom Operators and Operators that are widely available. Building catalogs is required to use OLM with {microshift-short}. For more information, see the following link:
