= Optional: Disabling redirect when using a private storage endpoint on Azure

By default, redirect is enabled when using the image registry. Redirect allows off-loading of traffic from the registry pods into the object storage, which makes pull faster. When redirect is enabled and the storage account is private, users from outside of the cluster are unable to pull images from the registry.

In some cases, users might want to disable redirect so that users from outside of the cluster can pull images from the registry.

Use the following procedure to disable redirect.

.Prerequisites

* You have configured the image registry to run on Azure.
* You have configured a route.

.Procedure

* Enter the following command to disable redirect on the image
registry configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch configs.imageregistry cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"disableRedirect": true}}'
----

.Verification

. Fetch the registry service name by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get imagestream -n openshift
