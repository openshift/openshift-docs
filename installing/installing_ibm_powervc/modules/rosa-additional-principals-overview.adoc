= Additional principals on your {product-title} cluster

You can allow AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles as additional principals to connect to your cluster's private API server endpoint.

You can access your {product-title} cluster's API Server endpoint from either the public internet or the interface endpoint that was created within the VPC private subnets. By default, you can privately access your {product-title} API Server by using the `-kube-system-kube-controller-manager` Operator role. To be able to access {product-title} API server from another account directly without using the primary account where cluster is installed, you must include cross-account IAM roles as additional principals. This feature allows you to simplify your network architecture and reduce data transfer costs by avoiding peering or attaching cross-account VPCs to cluster's VPC.

In this diagram, the cluster creating account is designated as Account A. This account designates that another account, Account B, should have access to the API server.

[NOTE]
====
After you have configured additional allowed principals, you must create the interface VPC endpoint in the VPC from where you want to access the cross-account {product-title} API server. Then, create a private hosted zone in Route53 to route calls made to cross-account {product-title} API server to pass through the created VPC endpoint.
