The `reachabilityTotalTimeoutSeconds` parameter defines the total time limit in seconds for the platform health check process before a node is declared down.

The following table summarizes the acceptable values and their implications:

[cols="1,1,2a", options="header"]
|===
|Parameter Value (Seconds) |Effect on reachability check |Failover impact and use case
|`0` |Disables the reachability check. |No automatic failover: Use only if an external system handles node health monitoring and failover. The platform will not automatically react to node failures.
|`1 - 60` |Sets the total time limit for reachability probing. |Directly controls detection time: This value defines the lower limit for your overall failover time. A smaller value leads to faster failover but might increase network traffic. Default: 1 second. The maximum accepted integer value is 60.
