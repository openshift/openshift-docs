= Querying metrics for the istio-csr operand

[role="_abstract"]
Cluster administrators, or users with view access to all namespaces, can query metrics for the istio-csr operand by using the {product-title} web console. For more information, see "Accessing metrics".

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have installed the {cert-manager-operator}.
* You have enabled monitoring and metrics collection by creating the `ServiceMonitor` object for the istio-csr operand.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.
. Click *Observe* -> *Metrics*.
. In the query field, enter the `{job="cert-manager-istio-csr"}` PromQL expression to query the `istio-csr` operand metrics. The results display metrics collected for the istio-csr operand, which can help you monitor its performance and behavior.
