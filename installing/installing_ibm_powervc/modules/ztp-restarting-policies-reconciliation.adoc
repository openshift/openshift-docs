= Restarting policy reconciliation

You can restart policy reconciliation when unexpected compliance issues occur, for example, when the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` custom resource (CR) has timed out.

.Procedure

. A `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR is generated in the namespace `ztp-install` by the {cgu-operator-full} after the managed cluster becomes `Ready`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export CLUSTER=<clusterName>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clustergroupupgrades -n ztp-install $CLUSTER
----

. If there are unexpected issues and the policies fail to become complaint within the configured timeout (the default is 4 hours), the status of the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR shows `UpgradeTimedOut`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clustergroupupgrades -n ztp-install $CLUSTER -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")]}'
----

. A `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR in the `UpgradeTimedOut` state automatically restarts its policy reconciliation every hour. If you have changed your policies, you can start a retry immediately by deleting the existing `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR. This triggers the automatic creation of a new `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR that begins reconciling the policies immediately:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete clustergroupupgrades -n ztp-install $CLUSTER
----

Note that when the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR completes with status `UpgradeCompleted` and the managed cluster has the label `ztp-done` applied, you can make additional configuration changes by using `{policy-gen-cr}`. Deleting the existing `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR will not make the {cgu-operator} generate a new CR.

At this point, {ztp} has completed its interaction with the cluster and any further interactions should be treated as an update and a new `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR created for remediation of the policies.
