= Configuring disk sharing by using LUN

[role="_abstract"]
To secure data on your VM from outside access, you can enable SCSI persistent reservation and configure a LUN-backed virtual machine disk to be shared among multiple virtual machines.

By enabling the shared option, you can use advanced SCSI commands, such as those required for a Windows failover clustering implementation, for managing the underlying storage.

When a storage volume is configured as the `LUN` disk type, a VM can use the volume as a logical unit number (LUN) device. As a result, the VM can deploy and manage the disk by using SCSI commands.

You reserve a LUN through the SCSI persistent reserve options. To enable the reservation: 

. Configure the feature gate option
. Activate the feature gate option on the LUN disk to issue SCSI device-specific input and output controls (IOCTLs) that the VM requires.

You can set an error policy for each LUN disk. The error policy controls how the hypervisor behaves when an input/output error occurs on a disk Read or Write. The default behavior stops the guest and generates a Kubernetes event.

For a LUN disk with an SCSi connection and a persistent reservation, as required for Windows Failover Clustering for shared volumes, you set the error policy to `report`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{VirtProductName} does not currently support SCSI-3 Persistent Reservations (SCSI-3 PR) over multipath storage. As a workaround, disable multipath or ensure the Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) shared disk is setup from a single device and not part of multipath.
====

.Prerequisites

* You must have cluster administrator privileges to configure the feature gate option.

* The volume access mode must be `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) if the VMs that are sharing disks are running on different nodes.
+
If the VMs that are sharing disks are running on the same node, `ReadWriteOnce` (RWO) volume access mode is sufficient.

* The storage provider must support a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver that uses Fibre Channel (FC), Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), or iSCSI storage protocols.

* If you are a cluster administrator and intend to configure disk sharing by using LUN, you must enable the cluster's feature gate on the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR).

* Disks that you want to share must be in block mode.

.Procedure

. Edit or create the `VirtualMachine` manifest for your VM to set the required values, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: vm-0
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      domain:
        devices:
          disks:
          - disk:
              bus: sata
            name: rootdisk
          - errorPolicy: report <1>
            lun: <2>
              bus: scsi
              reservation: true <3>
            name: na-shared
            serial: shared1234
      volumes:
      - dataVolume:
          name: vm-0
        name: rootdisk
      - name: na-shared
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: pvc-na-share
----
<1> Identifies the error policy.
<2> Identifies a LUN disk.
<3> Identifies that the persistent reservation is enabled.

. Save the `VirtualMachine` manifest file to apply your changes.
