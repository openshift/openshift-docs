.Procedure
. Set the `apply` flag to `false`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-compliance \
patch complianceremediations/rhcos4-moderate-worker-sysctl-net-ipv4-conf-all-accept-redirects \
--patch '{"spec":{"apply":false}}' --type=merge
----

====
The Compliance Operator does not automatically resolve dependency issues that can occur between remediations. Users should perform a rescan after remediations are applied to ensure accurate results.
