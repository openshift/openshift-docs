= About NonAdminDownloadRequest CR

[role="_abstract"]
Review backup and restore logs by using the `NonAdminDownloadRequest` (NADR) custom resource (CR). This helps you troubleshoot backup and restore issues without cluster administrator assistance. 

The NADR CR provides information that is equivalent to what a cluster administrator can access by using the `velero backup describe --details` command.

After the NADR CR request is validated, a secure download URL is generated to access the requested information.

You can download the following NADR resources:
