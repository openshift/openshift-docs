= Glossary of common terms for {product-registry}

[role="_abstract"]
This glossary defines the common terms that are used in the registry content.

container::
Lightweight and executable images that consist of software and all its dependencies. Because containers virtualize the operating system, you can run containers in a data center, a public or private cloud, or your local host.

ifdef::openshift-rosa,openshift-rosa-hcp[]
Image Registry Operator::
ifdef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
The Image Registry Operator runs in the `CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE` of the management cluster, and manages the registry instance in the `openshift-image-registry` of the cluster.
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
The Image Registry Operator runs in the `openshift-image-registry` namespace, and manages the registry instance in that location.
endif::openshift-rosa[]
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-rosa-hcp[]

image repository::
An image repository is a collection of related container images and tags identifying images.

mirror registry::
The mirror registry is a registry that holds the mirror of {product-title} images.

namespace::
A namespace isolates groups of resources within a single cluster.

pod::
The pod is the smallest logical unit in Kubernetes. A pod consists of one or more containers to run in a compute node.

private registry::
A registry is a server that implements the container image registry API. A private registry is a registry that requires authentication so that users can access the content of the registry.

public registry::
A registry is a server that implements the container image registry API. A public registry is a registry that serves its content publicly.

Quay.io::
A public {quay} Container Registry instance provided and maintained by Red Hat, which serves most of the container images and Operators to {product-title} clusters.

{product-registry}::
{product-registry} is the registry provided by {product-title} to manage images.

registry authentication::
To push and pull images to and from private image repositories, the registry needs to authenticate its users with credentials.

route::
Exposes a service to allow for network access to pods from users and applications outside the {product-title} instance.

scale down::
To decrease the number of replicas.

scale up::
To increase the number of replicas.

service::
A service exposes a running application on a set of pods.
