= Creating ConfigMap objects of extra manifests for the image-based upgrade with {lcao}

Create additional manifests that you want to apply to the target cluster.

[NOTE]
====
If you add more than one extra manifest, and the manifests must be applied in a specific order, you must prefix the filenames of the manifests with numbers that represent the required order. For example, `00-namespace.yaml`, `01-sriov-extra-manifest.yaml`, and so on.
====

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file that contains your extra manifests, such as SR-IOV.
