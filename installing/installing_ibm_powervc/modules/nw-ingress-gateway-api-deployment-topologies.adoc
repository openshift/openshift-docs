= Gateway API deployment topologies

[role="_abstract"] 
To optimise network security and resource allocation in {product-title}, choose between shared or dedicated gateway topologies when implementing the Gateway API. Selecting the appropriate topology ensures your infrastructure meets specific security requirements and operational advantages for your workloads.

Dedicated gateway:: Routes and any load balancers or proxies are served from the same namespace. The `Gateway`
object restricts routes to a particular application namespace. This is the default topology when deploying a Gateway API resource in {product-title}.

The following example shows a dedicated `Gateway` resource, `fin-gateway`:

.Example dedicated `Gateway` resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: fin-gateway
  namespace: openshift-ingress
spec:
  listeners:
  - name: http
    protocol: HTTP
    port: 8080
    hostname: "example.com"
----
* `spec.listeneres`:: If you do not set `spec.listeners[].allowedRoutes` for a `Gateway` resource, the system implicitly sets the `namespaces.from` field to the value of `Same`.

The following example shows the associated `HTTPRoute` resource, `sales-db`, which attaches to the dedicated `Gateway` object:

.Example `HTTPRoute` resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: sales-db
  namespace: openshift-ingress
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: fin-gateway
  hostnames:
  - sales-db.example.com
  rules:
    - backendRefs:
        - name: sales-db
        ¦ port: 8080
----

The `HTTPRoute` resource must have the name of the `Gateway` object as the value for its `parentRefs` field in order to attach to the gateway. The system implicitly assumes that the route is exists in the same namespace as the `Gateway` object.

Shared gateway:: Routes are served from multiple namespaces or multiple hostnames. The `Gateway` object allows routes from application namespaces by using the `spec.listeners.allowedRoutes.namespaces` field.

The following example shows a `Gateway` resource, `devops-gateway`, that has a `spec.listeners.allowedRoutes.namespaces` label selector set to match any namespaces containing `shared-gateway-access: "true"`:

.Example shared `Gateway` resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: devops-gateway
  namespace: openshift-ingress
listeners:
  - name: https
    protocol: HTTPS
    hostname: "example.com"
    allowedRoutes:
      namespaces:
        from: Selector
        selector:
        ¦ matchLabels:
        ¦   shared-gateway-access: "true"
----

The following examples show the allowed namespaces for the `devops-gateway` resource:

.Example `Namespace` resources
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: dev
  labels:
    shared-gateway-access: "true"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: ops
  labels:
    shared-gateway-access: "true"
----

In this example, two `HTTPRoute` resources, `dev-portal` and `ops-home`, are in different namespaces but are attached to the shared gateway:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: dev-portal
  namespace: dev
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: devops-gateway
    namespace: openshift-ingress
  rules:
  - backendRefs:
    - name: dev-portal
      port: 8080
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: ops-home
  namespace: ops
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: devops-gateway
    namespace: openshift-ingress
  rules:
  - backendRefs:
    - name: ops-home
      port: 8080
----

With a shared gateway topology, the routes must specify the namespace of the `Gateway` object it wants to attach to. Multiple `Gateway` objects can be deployed and shared across namespaces. When there are multiple shared gateways, this topology becomes conceptually similar to Ingress Controller sharding.
