= Updating mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift from a remote host

This procedure explains how to update the _mirror registry for Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift_ from a remote host by using the `upgrade` command. Updating to the latest version ensures bug fixes and security vulnerability fixes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When upgrading from version 1 to version 2, be aware of the following constraints:

** The worker count is set to `1` because multiple writes are not allowed in SQLite. 
** You must not use the _mirror registry for Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift_ user interface (UP).
** Do not access the `sqlite-storage` Podman volume during the upgrade.
** There is intermittent downtime of your mirror registry because it is restarted during the upgrade process.
** PostgreSQL data is backed up under the `/$HOME/quay-install/quay-postgres-backup/` directory for recovery.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the _mirror registry for Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift_ on a remote host.

[NOTE]
====
Users who upgrade the _mirror registry for Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift_ with the `./mirror-registry upgrade -v` flag must include the same credentials used when creating their mirror registry.

====

* If you are upgrading the  _mirror registry for Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift_ from 1.3 -> 2.y and want to specify a custom SQLite storage path, you must pass in the `--sqliteStorage` flag, for example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./mirror-registry upgrade -v --targetHostname <remote_host_url> --targetUsername <user_name> -k ~/.ssh/my_ssh_key --sqliteStorage <example_directory_name>/quay-storage
