= Configuring registry storage for Nutanix

[role="_abstract"]
As a cluster administrator, following installation you must configure your registry to use storage.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have a cluster on Nutanix.
* You have provisioned persistent storage for your cluster, such as {rh-storage-first}.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} supports `ReadWriteOnce` access for image registry storage when you have only one replica. `ReadWriteOnce` access also requires that the registry uses the `Recreate` rollout strategy. To deploy an image registry that supports high availability with two or more replicas, `ReadWriteMany` access is required.
====
+
* You must have 100 Gi capacity.

.Procedure

. To configure your registry to use storage, change the `spec.storage.pvc` in the `configs.imageregistry/cluster` resource.
+
[NOTE]
====
When you use shared storage, review your security settings to prevent outside access.
====

. Verify that you do not have a registry pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod -n openshift-image-registry -l docker-registry=default
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
No resourses found in openshift-image-registry namespace
----
+
[NOTE]
=====
If you do have a registry pod in your output, you do not need to continue with this procedure.
=====

. Check the registry configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
storage:
  pvc:
    claim:
----
+
Leave the `claim` field blank to allow the automatic creation of an `image-registry-storage` persistent volume claim (PVC). The PVC is generated based on the default storage class. However, be aware that the default storage class might provide ReadWriteOnce (RWO) volumes, such as a RADOS Block Device (RBD), which can cause issues when you replicate to more than one replica.


. Check the `clusteroperator` status:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusteroperator image-registry
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
