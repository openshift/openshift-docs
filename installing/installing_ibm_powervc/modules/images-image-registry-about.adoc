[role="_abstract"]
An image registry is a content server that stores and serves container images in {product-title}. You can use registries to access container images from external sources or the integrated registry in {product-title}.

Registries contain a collection of one or more image repositories, which contain one or more tagged images. Red{nbsp}Hat provides a registry at link:https://catalog.redhat.com/en[registry.redhat.io] for subscribers. {product-title} can also supply its own {product-registry} for managing custom container images.
