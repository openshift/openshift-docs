= Understanding Private Service Connect

[role="_abstract"]
Private Service Connect (PSC), a capability of {gcp-full} networking, enables private communication between services across different projects or organizations within {gcp-short}. Users that implement PSC as part of their network connectivity can deploy {product-title} clusters in a private and secured environment within {GCP} without any public facing cloud resources.

For more information about PSC, see link:https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect[Private Service Connect].

[IMPORTANT]
