= Host firmware tuning

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
Tune host firmware settings for optimal performance during initial cluster deployment.
For more information, see "Recommended {sno} cluster configuration for vDU application workloads".
Apply tuning settings in the host firmware during initial deployment. For more information, see "Managing host firmware settings with {ztp}".
The managed cluster host firmware settings are available on the hub cluster as individual `BareMetalHost` custom resources (CRs) that are created when you deploy the managed cluster with the `ClusterInstance` CR and {ztp}.
+
[NOTE]
====
Create the `ClusterInstance` CR based on the provided reference `example-sno.yaml` CR.
====

Limits and requirements::
* You must enable Hyper-Threading in the host firmware settings

Engineering considerations::
* Tune all firmware settings for maximum performance.
* All settings are expected to be for maximum performance unless tuned for power savings.
* You can tune host firmware for power savings at the expense of performance as required.
// https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNF-11806
* Enable secure boot.
When secure boot is enabled, only signed kernel modules are loaded by the kernel.
Out-of-tree drivers are not supported.
