= Network Observability Operator

[role="_abstract"]
The Network Observability Operator provides the cluster-scoped `FlowCollector` API custom resource, which manages a pipeline of eBPF agents and services that collect, enrich, and store network flows in Loki or Prometheus.

A `FlowCollector` instance deploys pods and services that form a monitoring pipeline.

The `eBPF` agent is deployed as a `daemonset` object and creates the network flows. The pipeline collects and enriches network flows with Kubernetes metadata before storing them in Loki or generating Prometheus metrics.
