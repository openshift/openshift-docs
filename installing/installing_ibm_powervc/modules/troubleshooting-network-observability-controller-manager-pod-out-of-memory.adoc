= Network observability controller manager pod runs out of memory

[role="_abstract"]
Resolve memory issues with the Network Observability Operator by increasing the memory limits in the `Subscription` object to prevent the controller manager pod from running out of memory.

You can increase memory limits for the Network Observability Operator by editing the `spec.config.resources.limits.memory` specification in the `Subscription` object.

.Procedure

. In the web console, navigate to *Ecosystem* -> *Installed Operators*
. Click *Network Observability* and then select *Subscription*.
. From the *Actions* menu, click *Edit Subscription*.
.. Alternatively, you can use the CLI to open the YAML configuration for the `Subscription` object by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit subscription netobserv-operator -n openshift-netobserv-operator
----
. Edit the `Subscription` object to add the `config.resources.limits.memory` specification and set the value to account for your memory requirements. See the Additional resources for more information about resource considerations:
