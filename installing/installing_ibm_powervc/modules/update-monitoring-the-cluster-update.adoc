[id="update-monitoring-the-cluster-update_{context}"]
= Monitoring the cluster update

[role="_abstract"]
You should check the cluster health often during the update.
Check for the node status, cluster Operators status and failed pods.

.Procedure
+
* Monitor the cluster update.
For example, to monitor the cluster update from version 4.14 to 4.15, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ watch "oc get clusterversion; echo; oc get co | head -1; oc get co | grep 4.14; oc get co | grep 4.15; echo; oc get no; echo; oc get po -A | grep -E -iv 'running|complete'"

.Verification

During the update the `watch` command cycles through one or several of the cluster Operators at a time, providing a status of the Operator update in the `MESSAGE` column.

When the cluster Operators update process is complete, each control plane nodes is rebooted, one at a time.

[NOTE]
====
During this part of the update, messages are reported that state cluster Operators are being updated again or are in a degraded state.
This is because the control plane node is offline while it reboots nodes.
====

As soon as the last control plane node reboot is complete, the cluster version is displayed as updated.

When the control plane update is complete a message such as the following is displayed.
This example shows an update completed to the intermediate y-stream release.
