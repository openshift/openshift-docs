= Workload partitioning

{sno-caps} clusters that run DU workloads require workload partitioning. This limits the cores allowed to run platform services, maximizing the CPU core for application payloads.

[NOTE]
====
Workload partitioning can be enabled during cluster installation only.
You cannot disable workload partitioning postinstallation.
You can however change the set of CPUs assigned to the isolated and reserved sets through the `PerformanceProfile` CR.
Changes to CPU settings cause the node to reboot.
====

.Upgrading from {product-title} 4.12 to 4.13+
[NOTE]
====
When transitioning to using `cpuPartitioningMode` for enabling workload partitioning, remove the workload partitioning `MachineConfig` CRs from the `/extra-manifest` folder that you use to provision the cluster.
====

.Recommended `SiteConfig` CR configuration for workload partitioning

<1> Set the `cpuPartitioningMode` field to `AllNodes` to configure workload partitioning for all nodes in the cluster.

.Verification

Check that the applications and cluster system CPU pinning is correct. Run the following commands:

. Open a remote shell prompt to the managed cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/example-sno-1
----

. Check that the OpenShift infrastructure applications CPU pinning is correct:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.4# pgrep ovn | while read i; do taskset -cp $i; done
----
+
.Example output
