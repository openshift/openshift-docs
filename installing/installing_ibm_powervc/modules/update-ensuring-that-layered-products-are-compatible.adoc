[id="update-ensuring-layered-products-are-compatible_{context}"]
= Ensuring that layered products are compatible with the update

[role="_abstract"]
Verify that all layered products run on the version of {product-title} that you are updating to before you begin the update.
This generally includes all Operators.

.Procedure
+
. Verify the currently installed Operators in the cluster.
For example, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csv -A
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----

. Check that Operators that you install with OLM are compatible with the update version.
+
--
Operators that are installed with the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) are not part of the standard cluster Operators set.

Use the link:https://access.redhat.com/labs/ocpouic/?upgrade_path=4.14%20to%204.16[Operator Update Information Checker] to understand if you must update an Operator after each y-stream update or if you can wait until you have fully updated to the next EUS release.

[TIP]
====
You can also use the link:https://access.redhat.com/labs/ocpouic/?upgrade_path=4.14%20to%204.16[Operator Update Information Checker] to see what versions of {product-title} are compatible with specific releases of an Operator.

. Check that Operators that you install outside of OLM are compatible with the update version.
+
--
For all OLM-installed Operators that are not directly supported by Red Hat, contact the Operator vendor to ensure release compatibility.

* Some Operators are compatible with several releases of {product-title}.
+
See "Updating the worker nodes" for more information.

* See "Updating all the OLM Operators" for information about updating an Operator after performing the first y-stream control plane update.
