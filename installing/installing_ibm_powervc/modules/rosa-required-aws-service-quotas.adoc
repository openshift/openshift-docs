= Required AWS service quotas

[role="_abstract"]
The table below describes the AWS service quotas and levels required to create and run one {product-title} cluster. Although most default values are suitable for most workloads, you might need to request additional quota for the following cases:

* {product-title} clusters require a minimum AWS EC2 service quota of
ifndef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
100{nbsp}vCPUs
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
32{nbsp}vCPUs
endif::[]
to provide for cluster creation, availability, and upgrades. The default maximum value for vCPUs assigned to Running On-Demand Standard Amazon EC2 instances is `5`. Therefore if you have not created a {product-title} cluster using the same AWS account previously, you must request additional EC2 quota for `Running On-Demand Standard (A, C, D, H, I, M, R, T, Z) instances`.

//TODO OSDOCS-11789 confirm number of secgroups on HCP clusters - Bala says 10, who can confirm?
* Some optional cluster configuration features, such as custom security groups, might require you to request additional quota. For example, because {product-title} associates 1 security group with network interfaces in worker machine pools by default, and the default quota for `Security groups per network interface` is `5`, if you want to add 5 custom security groups, you must request additional quota, because this would bring the total number of security groups on worker network interfaces to 6.

[NOTE]
====
The AWS SDK allows {product-title} to check quotas, but the AWS SDK calculation does not account for your existing usage. Therefore, it is possible for cluster creation to fail because of a lack of available quota even though the AWS SDK quota check passes. To fix this issue, increase your quota.
====

If you need to modify or increase a specific AWS quota, see Amazon's documentation on link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html[requesting a quota increase]. Large quota requests are submitted to Amazon Support for review, and can take some time to be approved. If your quota request is urgent, contact AWS Support.
