= Providing user permissions

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure role-based access control (RBAC) objects for the users of your {kueue-name} deployment. These objects determine which types of users can create which types of {kueue-name} objects.  

You need to provide permissions to the users that require access to the specific APIs.

* If the user needs access to the pending workloads from the `ClusterQueue` resource, a `ClusterRoleBinding` schema needs to be created referencing the ClusterRole `kueue-batch-admin-role`.

* If the user needs access to the pending workloads from the `LocalQueue` resource, a `RoleBinding` schema needs to be created referencing the ClusterRole `kueue-batch-user-role`.
