= Cluster Samples Operator tracking and error recovery of image stream imports

[role="_abstract"]
After creation or update of a samples image stream, the Cluster Samples Operator monitors the progress of each image stream tag's image import.

If an import fails, the Cluster Samples Operator retries the import through the image stream image import API at a rate of about every 15 minutes until either one of the following occurs:

* The import succeeds.
* The Cluster Samples Operator configuration is changed such that either the image stream is added to the `skippedImagestreams` list, or the management state is changed to `Removed`.
