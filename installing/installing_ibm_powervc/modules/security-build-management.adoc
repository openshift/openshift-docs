= Managing builds

You can use Source-to-Image (S2I) to combine source code and base images.
_Builder images_ make use of S2I to enable your development and operations teams
to collaborate on a reproducible build environment.
With Red Hat S2I images available as Universal Base Image (UBI) images,
you can now freely redistribute your software with
base images built from real {op-system-base} RPM packages.
Red Hat has removed subscription restrictions to allow this.

When developers commit code with Git for an application using build images,
{product-title} can perform the following functions:

* Trigger, either by using webhooks on the code repository or other automated
continuous integration (CI) process, to automatically assemble a new image from
available artifacts, the S2I builder image, and the newly committed code.
* Automatically deploy the newly built image for testing. 
* Promote the tested image to production where it can be automatically deployed
using a CI process.

You can use the integrated OpenShift Container Registry to manage access to final images.
Both S2I and native build images are automatically pushed to your OpenShift Container
Registry.

In addition to the included Jenkins for CI, you can also integrate your own
build and CI environment with {product-title} using RESTful APIs, as well as use
any API-compliant image registry.
