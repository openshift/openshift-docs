= About in-place pod resizing

In-place pod resizing allows you to change the CPU and memory resources for containers within a running pod without application disruption. The standard methods for changing pod CPU and memory resources cause the pod to be re-created, potentially causing disruption. In-place pod resizing allows you to scale pod resources up or down without suffering the downtime or state loss associated with a pod restart.

When using in-place pod resizing to change CPU or memory resources, you can control whether a pod is restarted by configuring a resize policy in the pod specification. The following example resize policy requires a pod restart upon changing the memory resources, but prevents a restart for CPU resource changes.

.Example resource policy
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: resize-demo
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    seccompProfile:
      type: RuntimeDefault
  containers:
  - name: pause
# ...
    resizePolicy: <1>
    - resourceName: cpu
      restartPolicy: NotRequired
    - resourceName: memory
      restartPolicy: RestartContainer
----
<1> Specifies a resize policy. 

[NOTE]
====
Memory limits cannot be decreased unless the resize policy for `memory` is `RestartContainer`.
====

You cannot add or modify a resize policy to an existing pod, but you can add or edit the policy in the pod's owner object, such as a deployment, if the pod has an owner object. 

Using in-place pod resizing requires that you use the `--subresource resize` flag when editing a pod in the {oc-first}, as shown in the following examples:

.Example commands
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit pod <pod_name>  --subresource resize
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <file_name>.yaml --subresource resize
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch pod <pod_name> --subresource resize --patch \
  '{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"pause", "resources":{"requests":{"cpu":"800m"}, "limits":{"cpu":"800m"}}}]}}'
----

Because you need to use the `--subresource resize` flag with a resize policy, you cannot edit the pod resources in the {product-title} web console.

If the resize policy is `NotRequired` and you change the request or limits, the pod is not restarted.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS     AGE
resize-pod                    1/1     Running   0            5s
----

If the resize policy is `RestartContainer` and you change the request or limits, the pod is restarted.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS    AGE
resize-pod                   1/1     Running   1 (5s ago)  5s
----

After making the resource changes, the pod status conditions indicate the state of a resize request by using the following messages:

* `PodResizeInProgress`: The kubelet is able to allocate the requested resources and the change is being applied.
* `PodResizePending`: The kubelet cannot immediately make the change for one of the following reasons:
** `Infeasible`: The requested resize cannot be executed on the current node. For example, requesting more resources than the node has available would result in an `Infeasible` condition.
** `Deferred`: The requested resize is currently not possible, but might become possible at a later time. For example, if another pod is removed from the node, the requested resources might become available. The kubelet retries the resize when conditions on the node change.
* `Error`: The kubelet is experiencing an error during the resource allocation and reports the reason for the error in the message field.

.Example status for an infeasible change
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: resize-demo
# ...
status:
  conditions:
  - lastProbeTime: "2025-09-03T15:00:50Z"
    lastTransitionTime: "2025-09-03T15:00:50Z"
    message: 'Node didn''t have enough capacity: cpu, requested: 1000000, capacity:
      3500'
    reason: Infeasible
    status: "True"
    type: PodResizePending
----

Note the following limitations:

* In-place pod resizing is not supported for non-restartable init containers and ephemeral containers.
* In-place pod resizing is not allowed if the changes violate other pod mutability constraints, such as the pod QoS class.
* Pods managed by a static `cpuManagerPolicy` or `memoryManagerPolicy` parameter cannot be resized with in-place pod resizing.
* Pods utilizing swap memory must use the `RestartContainer` policy for memory requests with in-place pod resizing.
