= Enabling remote health reporting

If you or your organization have disabled remote health reporting, you can enable this feature again. You can see that remote health reporting is disabled from the message `Insights not available` in the *Status* tile on the {product-title} web console *Overview* page.

To enable remote health reporting, you must change the global cluster pull secret with a new authorization token. Enabling remote health reporting enables both {insights-operator} and Telemetry.
