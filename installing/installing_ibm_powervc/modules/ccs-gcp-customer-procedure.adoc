The Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) model allows Red{nbsp}Hat to deploy and manage {product-title} into a customer's {gcp-first} project. Red{nbsp}Hat requires several prerequisites to be completed before providing these services.
[NOTE]
====
The following requirements in this topic apply to {product-title} on {GCP} clusters created using both the Workload Identity Federation (WIF) and service account authentication types.
Red{nbsp}Hat recommends using WIF as the authentication type for installing and interacting with an {product-title} cluster deployed on {gcp-short} because WIF provides enhanced security.

For information about creating a cluster using the WIF authentication type, see _Additional resources_.

For additional requirements that apply to the WIF authentication type only, see _Workload Identity Federation authentication type procedure_.
For additional requirements that apply to the service account authentication type only, see _Service account authentication type procedure_.
====

.Prerequisites

Before using {product-title} in your {gcp-short} project, confirm that the following organizational policy constraints are configured correctly where applicable:

* `constraints/iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains`
** This policy constraint is supported only if Red{nbsp}Hat's Directory Customer ID's `C02k0l5e8` and `C04j7mbwl` are included in the allowlist.
* `constraints/compute.restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypes`
** This organization policy constraint restricts the types of {GCP} load balancer types that can be created within a project. Certain load balancer types are required depending on the type of {product-title} cluster you are creating.
*** For private Workload Identity Federation (WIF)-enabled {product-title} clusters with {gcp-short} Private Service Connect (PSC), you must ensure the `INTERNAL_TCP_UDP` load balancer type is included in your organization's allowlist or excluded from the denylist.
*** For public WIF-enabled {product-title} clusters, you must ensure the `INTERNAL_TCP_UDP`, `EXTERNAL_TCP_PROXY`, and `EXTERNAL_NETWORK_TCP_UDP` load balancer types are permitted in your organization's allowlist or excluded from the denylist.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Although the `EXTERNAL_NETWORK_TCP_UDP` load balancer type is not required when creating a private cluster with PSC, disallowing it with this constraint will prevent the cluster from being able to create externally accessible load balancers.
====

* `constraints/compute.requireShieldedVm`
** This policy constraint is supported only if the cluster is created with *Enable Secure Boot support for Shielded VMs* selected during the initial cluster creation.
* `constraints/compute.vmExternalIpAccess`
** This policy constraint is supported only when creating a private cluster with {gcp-short} Private Service Connect (PSC). For all other cluster types, this policy constraint is supported only after cluster creation.
* `constraints/compute.trustedImageProjects`
** This policy constraint is supported only when the projects `redhat-marketplace-public`, `rhel-cloud`, and `rhcos-cloud` are included in the allowlist. If this policy constraint is enabled and these projects are not included in the allowlist, cluster creation will fail.
