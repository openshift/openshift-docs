= Troubleshooting internal subnets for hosted clusters

If you encounter issues releated to subnets on {hcp}, the following information can help you determine the cause and find a resolution. 

The following known limitations exist related to internal subnets on hosted clusters:

* IPv6 subnets are not supported.
* The {hcp} command-line interface, `hcp`, might not have native flags for the subnet fields. Manual YAML editing or `oc patch` is required.
* Modifying OVN subnets after you create a cluster triggers a rollout of OVN components, which might cause brief network disruptions.
* You cannot modify OVN subnet configuration while a cluster update is in progress or scheduled.
