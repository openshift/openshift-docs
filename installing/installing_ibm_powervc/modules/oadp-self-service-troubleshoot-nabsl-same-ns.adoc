= Resolving error NonAdminBackupStorageLocation not found in the namespace

[role="_abstract"]
Resolve the `NonAdminBackupStorageLocation not found in the namespace` error by using a backup storage location that belongs to the same namespace as your backup. This helps ensure successful backup operations.

Consider the following scenario of a namespace `admin` backup:

* You have created two `NonAdminBackupStorageLocations` (NABLs) custom resources (CRs) in two different namespaces, for example, `nabsl-1` in `namespace-1` and `nabsl-2` in `namespace-2`.
* You are taking a backup of `namespace-1` and use `nabsl-2` in the `NonAdminBackup` (NAB) CR.

In this scenario, after creating the NAB CR, you get the following error. The cause of the error is that the NABSL CR does not belong to the namespace that you are trying to back up.

In this scenario, you must use `nabsl-1` in the NAB CR to back up `namespace-1`.
