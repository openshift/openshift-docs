The **Settings** tab provides a few options for the cluster owner:

ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
* **Monitoring**, which is enabled by default, allows for reporting done on user-defined actions.
endif::openshift-rosa[]
* **Update strategy** allows you to determine if the cluster automatically updates on a certain day of the week at a specified time or if all updates are scheduled manually.
ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
* **Node draining** sets the duration that protected workloads are respected during updates. When this duration has passed, the node is forcibly removed.
endif::openshift-rosa[]
* **Update status** shows the current version and if there are any updates available.
