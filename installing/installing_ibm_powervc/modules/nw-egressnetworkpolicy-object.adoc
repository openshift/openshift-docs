= EgressNetworkPolicy custom resource (CR)

You can define one or more rules for an egress firewall. A rule is either an `Allow` rule or a `Deny` rule, with a specification for the traffic that the rule applies to.

The following YAML describes an `EgressNetworkPolicy` CR:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: network.openshift.io/v1
kind: EgressNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name:
spec:
  egress:
  ...
----

where:

<name>:: Specifies the name for your egress firewall policy.
<egress>:: Specifies a collection of one or more egress network policy rules as described in the following section.

[id="egressnetworkpolicy-rules_{context}"]
== EgressNetworkPolicy rules

The user can select either an IP address range in CIDR format, a domain name, or use the `nodeSelector` to allow or deny egress traffic. The `egress` stanza expects an array of one or more objects. The following YAML describes an egress firewall rule object.

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
egress:
- type: <type>
  to:
    cidrSelector: <cidr>
    dnsName: <dns_name>
    nodeSelector: <label_name>: <label_value>
----

where:

<type>:: Specifies the type of rule. The value must be either `Allow` or `Deny`.
<to>:: Specifies a stanza describing an egress traffic match rule that specifies the `cidrSelector` field or the `dnsName` field. You cannot use both fields in the same rule.
<cidr_range>:: Specifies an IP address range in CIDR format.
<dns_name>:: Specifies a DNS domain name.
<nodeSelector>:: Specifies labels which are key and value pairs that the user defines. Labels are attached to objects, such as pods. The `nodeSelector` allows for one or more node labels to be selected and attached to pods.
// - OVN-Kubernetes does not support DNS
// - OpenShift SDN does not support port and protocol specification

== Example EgressNetworkPolicy CR objects

The following example defines several egress firewall rules:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: EgressNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  egress: <1>
  - type: Allow

  - type: Deny
    to:

where:

<egress>:: Specifies a collection of egress firewall policy rule objects.
