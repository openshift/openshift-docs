= Implementing velero resource timeout

[role="_abstract"]
`resourceTimeout` defines how long to wait for several Velero resources before timeout occurs, such as Velero custom resource definition (CRD) availability, `volumeSnapshot` deletion, and repository availability. The default is `10m`.

Use the `resourceTimeout` for the following scenarios:

* For backups with total PV data usage that is greater than 1 TB. This parameter is used as a timeout value when Velero tries to clean up or delete the Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots, before marking the backup as complete.
** A sub-task of this cleanup tries to patch VSC, and this timeout can be used for that task.

* To create or ensure a backup repository is ready for filesystem based backups for Restic or Kopia.
* To check if the Velero CRD is available in the cluster before restoring the custom resource (CR) or resource from the backup.

.Procedure

* Edit the values in the `spec.configuration.velero.resourceTimeout` block of the `DataProtectionApplication` CR manifest, as shown in the following example:
