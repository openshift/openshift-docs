= Setting build resources

By default, builds are completed by pods using unbound resources, such as memory and CPU. These resources can be limited.

.Procedure

You can limit resource use in two ways:

* Limit resource use by specifying resource limits in the default container limits of a project.
* Limit resource use by specifying resource limits as part of the build configuration.
** In the following example, each of the `resources`, `cpu`, and `memory` parameters are optional:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "BuildConfig"
metadata:
  name: "sample-build"
spec:
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: "100m" <1>
      memory: "256Mi" <2>
----
<1> `cpu` is in CPU units: `100m` represents 0.1 CPU units (100 * 1e-3).
<2> `memory` is in bytes: `256Mi` represents 268435456 bytes (256 * 2 ^ 20).
+
However, if a quota has been defined for your project, one of the following two items is required:
+
*** A `resources` section set with an explicit `requests`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
resources:
  requests: <1>
    cpu: "100m"
    memory: "256Mi"
----
<1> The `requests` object contains the list of resources that correspond to the list of resources in the quota.
+
*** A limit range defined in your project, where the defaults from the `LimitRange` object apply to pods created during the build process.
+
Otherwise, build pod creation will fail, citing a failure to satisfy quota.
