= Challenges of managing symmetric routing with MetalLB

[role="_abstract"]
To resolve network isolation and asymmetric routing challenges on multiple host interfaces, implement a configuration combining MetalLB, NMState, and OVN-Kubernetes. This solution ensures symmetric routing and prevents overlapping CIDR addresses without requiring manual static route maintenance.

One option to ensure that return traffic reaches the correct client is to use static routes. However, with this solution, MetalLB cannot isolate the services and then announce each service through a different interface. Additionally, static routing requires manual configuration and requires maintenance if remote sites are added.

A further challenge of symmetric routing when implementing a MetalLB service is scenarios where external systems expect the source and destination IP address for an application to be the same. The default behavior for {product-title} is to assign the IP address of the host network interface as the source IP address for traffic originating from pods. This is problematic with multiple host interfaces.

You can overcome these challenges by implementing a configuration that combines features from MetalLB, NMState, and OVN-Kubernetes.
