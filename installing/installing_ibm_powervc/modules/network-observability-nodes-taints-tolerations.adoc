= Network observability deployment in specific nodes

[role="_abstract"]
Configure the `FlowCollector` resource using scheduling specifications, including `NodeSelector`, `Tolerations`, and `Affinity`, to control the deployment of network observability components on specific nodes.

The `spec.agent.ebpf.advanced.scheduling`, `spec.processor.advanced.scheduling`, and `spec.consolePlugin.advanced.scheduling` specifications have the following configurable settings:

* `NodeSelector`
* `Tolerations`
* `Affinity`
* `PriorityClassName`
