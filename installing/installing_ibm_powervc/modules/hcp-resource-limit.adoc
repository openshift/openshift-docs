= Request-based resource limit

The maximum number of {hcp} that the cluster can host is calculated based on the hosted control plane CPU and memory requests from the pods.

A highly available hosted control plane consists of 78 pods that request 5 vCPUs and 18 GiB memory. These baseline numbers are compared to the cluster worker node resource capacities to estimate the maximum number of {hcp}.
