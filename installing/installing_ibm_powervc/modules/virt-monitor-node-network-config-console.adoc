= Monitoring the policy status

[role="_abstract"]
You can monitor the policy status from the *NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy* page. This page displays all the policies created in the cluster in a tabular format, with the following columns:

Name:: The name of the policy created.

Matched nodes:: The count of nodes where the policies are applied. This could be either a subset of nodes based on the node selector or all the nodes on the cluster.

Node network state:: The enactment state of the matched nodes. You can click on the enactment state and view detailed information on the status.

To find the desired policy, you can filter the list either based on enactment state by using the *Filter* option, or by using the search option.
