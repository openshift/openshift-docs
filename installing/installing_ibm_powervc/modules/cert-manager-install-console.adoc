= Installing the {cert-manager-operator} by using the web console

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the web console to install the {cert-manager-operator}.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have access to the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.

. Navigate to *Ecosystem* -> *Software Catalog*.

. Enter *{cert-manager-operator}* into the filter box.

. Select the *{cert-manager-operator}*

. Select the {cert-manager-operator} version from *Version* drop-down list, and click *Install*.
+
[NOTE]
====
See supported {cert-manager-operator} versions in the following "Additional resources" section.
====

. On the *Install Operator* page:
.. Update the *Update channel*, if necessary. The channel defaults to *stable-v1*, which installs the latest stable release of the {cert-manager-operator}.
.. Choose the *Installed Namespace* for the Operator. The default Operator namespace is `cert-manager-operator`.
+
If the `cert-manager-operator` namespace does not exist, it is created for you.
+
[NOTE]
====
During the installation, the {product-title}  web console allows you to select between `AllNamespaces` and `SingleNamespace` installation modes. For installations with {cert-manager-operator} version 1.15.0 or later, it is recommended to choose the `AllNamespaces` installation mode. `SingleNamespace` and `OwnNamespace` support will remain for earlier versions but will be deprecated in future versions.
====

.. Select an *Update approval* strategy.
+
* The *Automatic* strategy allows Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to automatically update the Operator when a new version is available.
+
* The *Manual* strategy requires a user with appropriate credentials to approve the Operator update.

.. Click *Install*.

.Verification

. Navigate to *Ecosystem* -> *Installed Operators*.
. Verify that *{cert-manager-operator}* is listed with a *Status* of *Succeeded* in the `cert-manager-operator` namespace.

+
[source,terminal]
