= BMC addressing for Dell iDRAC

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure the `bmc` parameter to use the iDRAC virtual media protocol, the Redfish network boot protocol, or the IPMI protocol to connect to a Dell iDRAC system.

The `address` configuration setting for each `bmc` entry is a URL for connecting to the {product-title} cluster nodes, including the type of controller in the URL scheme and its location on the network. The `username` configuration for each `bmc` entry must specify a user with `Administrator` privileges.

|====
|Protocol|Address Format
|iDRAC virtual media| `idrac-virtualmedia://<out_of_band_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1`
|Redfish network boot|`redfish://<out_of_band_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1`
|IPMI|`ipmi://<out_of_band_ip>`
|====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use `idrac-virtualmedia` as the protocol for Redfish virtual media. `redfish-virtualmedia` will not work on Dell hardware. Dell's `idrac-virtualmedia` uses the Redfish standard with Dell's OEM extensions.
====

See the following sections for additional details.


== Redfish virtual media for Dell iDRAC

For Redfish virtual media on Dell servers, use `idrac-virtualmedia://` in the `address` setting. Using `redfish-virtualmedia://` will not work.

[NOTE]
====
Use `idrac-virtualmedia://` as the protocol for Redfish virtual media. Using `redfish-virtualmedia://` will not work on Dell hardware, because the `idrac-virtualmedia://` protocol corresponds to the `idrac` hardware type and the Redfish protocol in Ironic. Dell's `idrac-virtualmedia://` protocol uses the Redfish standard with Dell's OEM extensions. Ironic also supports the `idrac` type with the WSMAN protocol. Therefore, you must specify `idrac-virtualmedia://` to avoid unexpected behavior when electing to use Redfish with virtual media on Dell hardware.
====

The following example demonstrates using iDRAC virtual media within the  `install-config.yaml` file.

It is recommended to have a certificate of authority for the out-of-band management addresses. For {product-title} 4.16 and earlier, you must include `disableCertificateVerification: True` in the `bmc` configuration if using self-signed certificates. For {product-title} 4.17 and later, you can include `disableCertificateVerification: False` when used in conjunction with the `bmcCACert` configuration setting.

[NOTE]
====
Ensure the {product-title} cluster nodes have *AutoAttach* enabled through the iDRAC console. The menu path is: *Configuration* -> *Virtual Media* -> *Attach Mode* -> *AutoAttach*.

== Redfish network boot for iDRAC

To enable Redfish, use `redfish://` or `redfish+http://` to disable transport layer security (TLS). The installation program requires both the hostname or the IP address and the path to the system ID. The following example demonstrates a Redfish configuration within the `install-config.yaml` file.

[NOTE]
====
There is a known issue on Dell iDRAC 9 with firmware version `04.40.00.00` and all releases up to including the `5.xx` series for installer-provisioned installations on bare metal deployments. The virtual console plugin defaults to eHTML5, an enhanced version of HTML5, which causes problems with the *InsertVirtualMedia* workflow. Set the plugin to use HTML5 to avoid this issue. The menu path is *Configuration* -> *Virtual console* -> *Plug-in Type* -> *HTML5* .

Ensure the {product-title} cluster nodes have *AutoAttach* enabled through the iDRAC console. The menu path is: *Configuration* -> *Virtual Media* -> *Attach Mode* -> *AutoAttach* .
