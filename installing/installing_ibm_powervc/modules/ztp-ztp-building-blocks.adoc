= Overview of deploying managed clusters with {ztp}

{rh-rhacm-first} uses {ztp-first} to deploy single-node {product-title} clusters, three-node clusters, and standard clusters. You manage site configuration data as {product-title} custom resources (CRs) in a Git repository. {ztp} uses a declarative GitOps approach for a develop once, deploy anywhere model to deploy the managed clusters.

The deployment of the clusters includes:

* Installing the host operating system (RHCOS) on a blank server

* Deploying {product-title}

* Creating cluster policies and site subscriptions

* Making the necessary network configurations to the server operating system

* Deploying profile Operators and performing any needed software-related configuration, such as performance profile, PTP, and SR-IOV

== Overview of the managed site installation process

After you apply the managed site custom resources (CRs) on the hub cluster, the following actions happen automatically:

. A Discovery image ISO file is generated and booted on the target host.

. When the ISO file successfully boots on the target host it reports the host hardware information to {rh-rhacm}.

. After all hosts are discovered, {product-title} is installed.

. When {product-title} finishes installing, the hub installs the `klusterlet` service on the target cluster.

. The requested add-on services are installed on the target cluster.

The Discovery image ISO process is complete when the `Agent` CR  for the managed cluster is created on the hub cluster.
