= Allocating API and Ingress Load Balancers to Specific Subnets on AWS

[role="_abstract"]
You can control the network placement of {product-title} Load Balancers on {aws-short}, including Load Balancers for the Ingress Controller, by explicitly defining your subnets from the virtual private cloud (VPC). You can then assign the subnets specific roles directly within the `platform.aws.vpc.subnets` section of the `install-config.yaml` file. 

By using this method, you have granular control of subnets that are used for resources, such as the Ingress Controller and other cluster components.
