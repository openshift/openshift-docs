= Understanding Customer Cloud Subscriptions on {gcp-short}

[role="_abstract"]
Red{nbsp}Hat {product-title} provides a Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) model that allows Red{nbsp}Hat to deploy and manage {product-title} into a customer's existing {GCP} account. Red{nbsp}Hat requires several prerequisites be met in order to provide this service.

Red{nbsp}Hat recommends the usage of a {gcp-short} project, managed by the customer, to organize all of your {gcp-short} resources. A project consists of a set of users and APIs, as well as billing, authentication, and monitoring settings for those APIs.

It is recommended for the {product-title} cluster using a CCS model to be hosted in a {gcp-short} project within a {gcp-short} organization. The organization resource is the root node of the {gcp-short} resource hierarchy and all resources that belong to an organization are grouped under the organization node. Customers have the choice of using service account keys or Workload Identity Federation when creating the roles and credentials necessary to access {gcp-full} resources within a {gcp-short} project.
