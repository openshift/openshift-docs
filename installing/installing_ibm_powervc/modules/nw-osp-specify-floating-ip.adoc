= Specifying a floating IP address in the Ingress Controller

[role="_abstract"]
To establish external access to your {product-title} cluster on {rh-openstack-first}, use the automatically assigned floating IP address. The floating IP address is associated with your Ingress port.

You might want to precreate a floating IP address before updating your DNS records and cluster deployment. In this situation, you can define a floating IP address to the Ingress Controller. You can do this regardless of whether you are using Octavia or a user-managed cluster.

.Procedure

. Create the Ingress Controller custom resource (CR) file with the floating IPs:
+
.Example Ingress config `sample-ingress.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
  name: <name>
spec:
  domain: <domain>
  endpointPublishingStrategy:
    type: LoadBalancerService
    loadBalancer:
      scope: External
      providerParameters:
        type: OpenStack
        openstack:
          floatingIP: <ingress_port_IP>
----
+
where:
+
`metadata.name`:: Specifies the name of your Ingress Controller. If you are using the default Ingress Controller, the value for this field is `default`.
`spec.domain`:: Specifies the DNS name serviced by the Ingress Controller.
`loadBalancer.scope`:: You must set the scope to `External` to use a floating IP address.
`openstack.floatingIP`:: Specifies the floating IP address associated with the port your Ingress Controller is listening on.

. Apply the CR file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f sample-ingress.yaml
----

. Update your DNS records with the Ingress Controller endpoint:
+
[source,text]
----
*.apps.<name>.<domain>. IN A <ingress_port_IP>
----

. Continue with creating your {product-title} cluster.

.Verification

* Confirm that the load balancer was successfully provisioned by checking the `IngressController` conditions using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ingresscontroller -n openshift-ingress-operator <name> -o jsonpath="{.status.conditions}" | yq -PC
----
