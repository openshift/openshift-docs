= Adding a custom CA during cluster installation 

[role="_abstract"]
To add a custom Certificate Authority (CA) to your {product-title} cluster during initial cluster installation, you can add the CA certificate to your `install-config.yaml` file. Adding the CA certificate during installation ensures that your cluster trusts the CA after installation.

The following procedure uses the `additionalTrustBundle` parameter. If you are also configuring an egress proxy, you can add this parameter to your `install-config.yaml` file along with your proxy configuration. For more information on the available proxy settings, see the "Configuring the cluster-wide proxy" chapter.

.Prerequisites 

* You have access to the `install-config.yaml` file for your cluster installation.

* You have your custom CA certificate avalable in PEM-encoded format.

.Procedure

. Open your `install-config.yaml` file.

. Add the `additionalTrustBundle` parameter with your PEM-encoded CA certificate:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: my.domain.com
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
additionalTrustBundle: |
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  <MY_PEM_ENCODED_CA_CERT>
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----
+
where:
+
`additionalTrustBundle`:: Specifies the custom CA certificate that you want the cluster to trust. The installation program uses the certificate to generate a `user-ca-bundle` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-config` namespace.

. Save the `install-config.yaml` file and continue with your cluster installation.
