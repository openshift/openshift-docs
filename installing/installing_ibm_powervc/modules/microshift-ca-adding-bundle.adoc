= Adding a certificate authority bundle

[role="_abstract"]
{microshift-short} uses the host trust bundle when clients evaluate server certificates.

You can also use a customized security certificate chain to improve the compatibility of your endpoint certificates with clients specific to your deployments. To do this, you can add a certificate authority (CA) bundle with root and intermediate certificates to the {op-system-ostree-first} system-wide truststore.
