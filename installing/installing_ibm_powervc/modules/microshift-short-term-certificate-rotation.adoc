= Short-term certificates rotation

[role="_abstract"]
Short-term certificates that are expired or close to their expiration dates must be rotated to ensure continued {microshift-short} operation.

The following situations describe {microshift-short} actions during short-term certificate lifetimes:

No rotation::
When a short-term certificate is up to 5 months old, no rotation occurs.

Rotation at restart::
When a short-term certificate is 5 to 8 months old, it is rotated when {microshift-short} starts or restarts.

Automatic restart for rotation::
When a short-term certificate is more than 8 months old, {microshift-short} can automatically restart to rotate and apply a new certificate.
