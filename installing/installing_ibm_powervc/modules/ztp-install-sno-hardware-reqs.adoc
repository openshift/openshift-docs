[NOTE]
====
One vCPU equals one physical core. However, if you enable simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or Hyper-Threading, use the following formula to calculate the number of vCPUs that represent one physical core:

* (threads per core × cores) × sockets = vCPUs

[IMPORTANT]
====
The server must have a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) when booting with virtual media.
