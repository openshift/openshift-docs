= Local Storage Operator Metrics

{product-title} provides the following metrics for the Local Storage Operator:

* `lso_discovery_disk_count`: total number of discovered devices on each node

* `lso_lvset_provisioned_PV_count`: total number of PVs created by `LocalVolumeSet` objects

* `lso_lvset_unmatched_disk_count`: total number of disks that Local Storage Operator did not select for provisioning because of mismatching criteria

* `lso_lvset_orphaned_symlink_count`: number of devices with PVs that no longer match `LocalVolumeSet` object criteria

* `lso_lv_orphaned_symlink_count`: number of devices with PVs that no longer match `LocalVolume` object criteria

* `lso_lv_provisioned_PV_count`: total number of provisioned PVs for `LocalVolume`

To use these metrics, enable them by doing one of the following:

* When installing the Local Storage Operator from the software catalog in the web console, select the _Enable Operator recommended cluster monitoring on this Namespace_ checkbox.

* Manually add the `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true` label to the Operator namespace by running the following command:
