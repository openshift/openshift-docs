= Configure MetalLB with a BGP advertisement and a basic use case

[role="_abstract"]
To advertise specific IPv4 and IPv6 routes to peer BGP routers for assigned load-balancer IP addresses, configure MetalLB by using default preference and community settings. Establishing these routes ensures reliable external traffic delivery and consistent network propagation for your application services.

Ensure that you can configure MetalLB so that the peer BGP routers receive one `203.0.113.200/32` route and one `fc00:f853:ccd:e799::1/128` route for each load-balancer IP address that MetalLB assigns to a service. If you do not specify the `localPref` and `communities` parameters, MetalLB advertises the routes with `localPref` set to `0 and no BGP communities.
