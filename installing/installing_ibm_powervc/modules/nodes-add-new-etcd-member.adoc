= Adding the new etcd member

Finish adding the new control plane node by adding the new etcd member to the cluster.

.Procedure

. Add the new etcd member to the cluster by performing the following steps in a single bash shell session:

.. Find the IP of the new control plane node by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes -owide -l node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
----
+
Make note of the node's IP address for later use.

.. List the etcd pods by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get -n openshift-etcd pods -l k8s-app=etcd -o wide
----

.. Connect to one of the running etcd pods by running the following command. The etcd pod on the new node should be in a `CrashLoopBackOff` state.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rsh -n openshift-etcd <running_pod>
----
+
Replace `<running_pod>` with the name of a running pod shown in the previous step.

.. View the etcd member list by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# etcdctl member list -w table
----

.. Add the new control plane etcd member by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# etcdctl member add <new_node> --peer-urls="https://<ip_address>:2380"
----
+
where:

`<new_node>`:: Specifies the name of the new control plane node
`<ip_address>`:: Specifies the IP address of the new node.

.. Exit the rsh shell by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# exit
----

. Force an etcd redeployment by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch etcd cluster -p='{"spec": {"forceRedeploymentReason": "single-master-recovery-'"$( date --rfc-3339=ns )"'"}}' --type=merge
----

. Turn the etcd quorum guard back on by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch etcd/cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec": {"unsupportedConfigOverrides": null}}'
----

. Monitor the cluster Operator rollout by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ watch oc get co
----
