= Starting the y-stream control plane update

[role="_abstract"]
After you have determined the full new release that you are moving to, you can run the `oc adm upgrade –to=x.y.z` command.

.Procedure
* Start the y-stream control plane update.
For example, run the following command:
+
[source,console]
----
$ oc adm upgrade --to=4.16.14
----
+
.Example output
[source,console]
----
Requested update to 4.16.14
----
+
You might move to a z-stream release that has potential issues with platforms other than the one you are running on.
The following example shows a potential problem for cluster updates on Microsoft Azure:
+
[source,console]
----
$ oc adm upgrade --to=4.16.15
----
+
.Example output
[source,console]
----
error: the update 4.16.15 is not one of the recommended updates, but is available as a conditional update. To accept the Recommended=Unknown risk and to proceed with update use --allow-not-recommended.
  Reason: EvaluationFailed
  Message: Exposure to AzureRegistryImagePreservation is unknown due to an evaluation failure: invalid PromQL result length must be one, but is 0

[NOTE]
====
The example shows a potential error that can affect clusters hosted in Microsoft Azure.
It does not show risks for bare-metal clusters.
