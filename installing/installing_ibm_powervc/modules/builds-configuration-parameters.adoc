[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|`Build`
|Holds cluster-wide information on how to handle builds. The canonical, and only valid name is `cluster`.

`spec`: Holds user-settable values for the build controller configuration.

|`buildDefaults`
|Controls the default information for builds.

`defaultProxy`: Contains the default proxy settings for all build operations, including image pull or push and source download.

You can override values by setting the `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables in the `BuildConfig` strategy.

`gitProxy`: Contains the proxy settings for Git operations only. If set, this overrides any proxy settings for all Git commands, such as `git clone`.

Values that are not set here are inherited from DefaultProxy.

`env`: A set of default environment variables that are applied to the build if the specified variables do not exist on the build.

`imageLabels`: A list of labels that are applied to the resulting image. You can override a default label by providing a label with the same name in the `BuildConfig`.

`resources`: Defines resource requirements to execute the build.

|`ImageLabel`
|`name`: Defines the name of the label. It must have non-zero length.

|`buildOverrides`
|Controls override settings for builds.

`imageLabels`: A list of labels that are applied to the resulting image. If you provided a label in the `BuildConfig` with the same name as one in this table, your label will be overwritten.

`nodeSelector`: A selector which must be true for the build pod to fit on a node.

`tolerations`: A list of tolerations that overrides any existing tolerations set on a build pod.

|`BuildList`
|`items`: Standard object's metadata.
