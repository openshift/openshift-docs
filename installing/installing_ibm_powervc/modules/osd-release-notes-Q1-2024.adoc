The following items were added during the first quarter of 2024.

* **{product-title} regions added.** {product-title} on {GCP} is now available in the Delhi, India (`asia-south2`) region. For more information on region availabilities, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_dedicated/4/html/introduction_to_openshift_dedicated/policies-and-service-definition#regions-availability-zones_osd-service-definition[Regions and availability zones].

* **Policy constraint update.** {product-title} on {GCP} users are now allowed to deploy clusters with the `constraints/iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains` constraint in place.
