= Network Observability Operator 1.9.0 new features and enhancements

[role="_abstract"]
You can review the new features and enhancements for the Network Observability Operator 1.9.0 release.

[id="user-defined-networks-with-network-observability_{context}"]
== User-defined networks with network observability
With this release, xref:../../../networking/multiple_networks/understanding-multiple-networks.adoc#understanding-multiple-networks[user-defined networks (UDN)] feature is generally available with network observability. When the `UDNMapping` feature is enabled in network observability, the *Traffic* flow table has a `UDN labels` column. You can filter logs on *Source Network Name* and *Destination Network Name* information.

[id="filter-flowlogs-at-ingestion_{context}"]
== Filter flowlogs at ingestion
With this release, you can create filters to reduce the number of generated network flows and the resource usage of network observability components. The following filters can be configured:

* eBPF Agent filters
* Flowlogs-pipeline filters

[id="ipsec-support_{context}"]
== IPsec support
This update brings the following enhancements to network observability when IPsec is enabled on {product-title}:

* A new column named *IPsec Status* is displayed in the network observability *Traffic* flows view to show whether a flow was successfully IPsec-encrypted or if there was an error during encryption/decryption.

* A new dashboard showing the percentage of encrypted traffic is generated.

[id="network-observability-cli-1-9_{context}"]
== Network Observability CLI
The following filtering options are now available for packets, flows, and metrics capture:

* Configure the ratio of packets being sampled by using the `--sampling` option.
* Filter flows using a custom query by using the `--query` option.
* Specify interfaces to monitor by using the `--interfaces` option.
* Specify interfaces to exclude by using the `--exclude_interfaces` option.
* Specify metric names to generate by using the `--include_list` option.
