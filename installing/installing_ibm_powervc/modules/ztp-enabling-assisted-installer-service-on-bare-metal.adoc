= Enabling the assisted service

{rh-rhacm-first} uses the assisted service to deploy {product-title} clusters. The assisted service is deployed automatically when you enable the MultiClusterHub Operator on {rh-rhacm-first}. After that, you need to configure the `Provisioning` resource to watch all namespaces and to update the `AgentServiceConfig` custom resource (CR) with references to the ISO and RootFS images that are hosted on the mirror registry HTTP server.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oc-first}.

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have {rh-rhacm} with `MultiClusterHub` enabled.

.Procedure

. Enable the `Provisioning` resource to watch all namespaces and configure mirrors for disconnected environments. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.9/html/clusters/cluster_mce_overview#enable-cim[Enabling the central infrastructure management service].

. Open the `AgentServiceConfig` CR to update the `spec.osImages` field by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit AgentServiceConfig
----

. Update the `spec.osImages` field in the `AgentServiceConfig` CR:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: agent-install.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: AgentServiceConfig
metadata:
 name: agent
spec:
# ...
  osImages:
    - cpuArchitecture: x86_64
      openshiftVersion: "{product-version}"
      rootFSUrl: https://<host>/<path>/rhcos-live-rootfs.x86_64.img
      url: https://<host>/<path>/rhcos-live.x86_64.iso
----
+
where:
+
--
`<host>` :: Specifies the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the target mirror registry HTTP server.
`<path>` :: Specifies the path to the image on the target mirror registry.
