= Scoping Operator installations

To provide scoping rules to Operator installations and upgrades on Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), associate a service account with an Operator group.

Using this example, a cluster administrator can confine a set of Operators to a designated namespace.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Create a new namespace:
+
.Example command that creates a `Namespace` object
[%collapsible]
====
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: scoped
EOF
----
====

. Allocate permissions that you want the Operator(s) to be confined to. This involves creating a new service account, relevant role(s), and role binding(s) in the newly created, designated namespace:

.. Create a service account by running the following command:
+
.Example command that creates a `ServiceAccount` object
[%collapsible]
====
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: scoped
  namespace: scoped
EOF
----
====

.. Create a secret by running the following command:
+
.Example command that creates a long-lived API token `Secret` object
[%collapsible]
====
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token <1>
metadata:
  name: scoped
  namespace: scoped
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: scoped
EOF
----
<1> The secret must be a long-lived API token, which is used by the service account.
====

.. Create a role by running the following command.
+
[WARNING]
====
In this example, the role grants the service account permissions to do anything in the designated namespace for demonostration purposes only. In a production environment, you should create a more fine-grained set of permissions. For more information, see "Fine-grained permissions".
====
+
.Example command that creates `Role` and `RoleBinding` objects
[%collapsible]
====
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: scoped
  namespace: scoped
rules:
- apiGroups: ["*"]
  resources: ["*"]
  verbs: ["*"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: scoped-bindings
  namespace: scoped
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: scoped
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: scoped
  namespace: scoped
EOF
----
====

. Create an `OperatorGroup` object in the designated namespace by running the following command. This Operator group targets the designated namespace to ensure that its tenancy is confined to it. In addition, Operator groups allow a user to specify a service account.
+
.Example command that creates an `OperatorGroup` object
[%collapsible]
====
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: scoped
  namespace: scoped
spec:
  serviceAccountName: scoped <1>
  targetNamespaces:
  - scoped
EOF
----
<1> Specify the service account created in the previous step. Any Operator installed in the designated namespace is tied to this Operator group and therefore to the service account specified.
====

. Create a `Subscription` object in the designated namespace to install an Operator:
+
.Example command that creates a `Subscription` object
[%collapsible]
====
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: openshift-cert-manager-operator
  namespace: scoped
spec:
  channel: stable-v1
  name: openshift-cert-manager-operator
  source: <catalog_source_name> <1>
  sourceNamespace: <catalog_source_namespace> <2>
EOF
----
<1> Specify a catalog source that already exists in the designated namespace or one that is in the global catalog namespace, for example `redhat-operators`.
<2> Specify a namespace where the catalog source was created, for example `openshift-marketplace` for the `redhat-operators` catalog.
====
+
Any Operator tied to this Operator group is confined to the permissions granted to the specified service account. If the Operator requests permissions that are outside the scope of the service account, the installation fails with relevant errors.
