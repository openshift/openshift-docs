= Network Observability Operator 1.6.0 fixed issues

[role="_abstract"]
You can review the following fixed issues for the Network Observability Operator 1.6.0.

* Previously, a dead link to the {product-title} documentation was displayed in the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) form for the `FlowMetrics` API creation. Now the link has been updated to point to a valid page. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1607[*NETOBSERV-1607*])
* Previously, the Network Observability Operator description in the Operator Hub displayed a broken link to the documentation. With this fix, this link is restored. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1544[*NETOBSERV-1544*])
* Previously, if Loki was disabled and the Loki `Mode` was set to `LokiStack`, or if Loki manual TLS configuration was configured, the Network Observability Operator still tried to read the Loki CA certificates. With this fix, when Loki is disabled, the Loki certificates are not read, even if there are settings in the Loki configuration. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1647[*NETOBSERV-1647*])
* Previously, the `oc` `must-gather` plugin for the Network Observability Operator was only working on the `amd64` architecture and failing on all others because the plugin was using `amd64` for the `oc` binary. Now, the Network Observability Operator `oc` `must-gather` plugin collects logs on any architecture platform.
* Previously, when filtering on IP addresses using `not equal to`, the Network Observability Operator would return a request error.
Now, the IP filtering works in both `equal` and `not equal to` cases for IP addresses and ranges. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1630[*NETOBSERV-1630*])
* Previously, when a user was not an admin, the error messages were not consistent with the selected tab of the *Network Traffic* view in the web console. Now, the `user not admin` error displays on any tab with improved display.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1621[*NETOBSERV-1621*])
