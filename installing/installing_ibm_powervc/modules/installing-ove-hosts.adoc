= Booting the remaining cluster hosts

[role="_abstract"]
After you have configured initial cluster details in the installation web console and have a defined cluster topology, you must boot the remaining machines that will make up your cluster from the ISO image.

[NOTE]
====
You can boot non-rendezvous node machines earlier in the installation process, even before you designate a machine as the rendezvous node. However, you must know the valid IP address that you will select for the rendezvous node.

When you boot your non-rendezvous node machines, the machines will perform a check to see if an Assisted Service is running at the specified rendezvous IP address.
If the service is not yet running, a warning appears to confirm whether you would still like to proceed booting the machine from the ISO image.

.Prerequisites

* You have downloaded the installation ISO.

.Procedure

. Attach the ISO image to a machine and boot the machine from this image.
You can also boot from a USB drive containing the ISO image.

. Wait for a machine to boot from the image and display the *Rendezvous node setup* menu.

. Enter the rendezvous node IP address in the *Rendezvous node setup* menu and select *Save rendezvous IP*.

. Select *Save and Continue*.

. Repeat this process for each remaining machine that will comprise the hosts in your cluster.
