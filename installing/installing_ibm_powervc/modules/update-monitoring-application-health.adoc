= Application liveness, readiness, and startup probes

[role="_abstract"]
You can use liveness, readiness and startup probes to check the health of your live application containers before you schedule an update.
These are very useful tools to use with pods that are dependent upon keeping state for their application containers.

Liveness health check::
Determines if a container is running.
If the liveness probe fails for a container, the pod responds based on the restart policy.

Readiness probe::
Determines if a container is ready to accept service requests.
If the readiness probe fails for a container, the kubelet removes the container from the list of available service endpoints.

Startup probe::
A startup probe indicates whether the application within a container is started.
All other probes are disabled until the startup succeeds.
If the startup probe does not succeed, the kubelet stops the container, and the container is subject to the pod `restartPolicy` setting.
