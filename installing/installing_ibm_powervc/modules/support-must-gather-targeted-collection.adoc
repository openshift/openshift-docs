= Reducing the size of must-gather output

The `oc adm must-gather` command collects comprehensive cluster information. However, a full data collection can result in a large file that is difficult to upload and analyze and could result in timeouts. 

To manage the output size and target your data collection for more effective troubleshooting, you can pass specific flags to the underlying `gather` script or scope the collection to particular resources.
