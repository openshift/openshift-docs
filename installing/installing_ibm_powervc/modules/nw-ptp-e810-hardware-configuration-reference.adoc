= Intel E810 NIC hardware configuration reference

Use this information to understand how to use the link:https://github.com/openshift/linuxptp-daemon/blob/release-4.16/addons/intel/e810.go[Intel E810 hardware plugin] to configure the E810 network interface as PTP grandmaster clock.
Hardware pin configuration determines how the network interface interacts with other components and devices in the system.
The Intel E810 NIC has four connectors for external 1PPS signals: `SMA1`, `SMA2`, `U.FL1`, and `U.FL2`.

[width="90%", options="header"]
|====
|Hardware pin|Recommended setting|Description
|`U.FL1`|`0 1`|Disables the `U.FL1` connector input.
The `U.FL1` connector is output-only.
|`U.FL2`|`0 2`|Disables the `U.FL2` connector output.
The `U.FL2` connector is input-only.
|`SMA1`|`0 1`|Disables the `SMA1` connector input.
The `SMA1` connector is bidirectional.
|`SMA2`|`0 2`|Disables the `SMA2` connector output.
The `SMA2` connector is bidirectional.

You can set the pin configuration on the Intel E810 NIC by using the `spec.profile.plugins.e810.pins` parameters as shown in the following example:
[source,yaml]
----
pins:
      <interface_name>:
        <connector_name>: <function> <channel_number>
----

Where:

`<function>`: Specifies the role of the pin. The following values are associated with the pin role:

* `0`: Disabled
* `1`: Rx (Receive timestamping)
* `2`: Tx (Transmit timestamping)

`<channel number>`: A number associated with the physical connector. The following channel numbers are associated with the physical connectors:

* `1`: `SMA1` or `U.FL1`
* `2`: `SMA2` or `U.FL2`

Examples:

* `0 1`: Disables the pin mapped to `SMA1` or `U.FL1`.
* `1 2`: Assigns the Rx function to `SMA2` or `U.FL2`.

[NOTE]
====
`SMA1` and `U.FL1` connectors share channel one. `SMA2` and `U.FL2` connectors share channel two.
====

Set `spec.profile.plugins.e810.ublxCmds` parameters to configure the GNSS clock in the `PtpConfig` custom resource (CR).

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must configure an offset value to compensate for T-GM GPS antenna cable signal delay.
To configure the optimal T-GM antenna offset value, make precise measurements of the GNSS antenna cable signal delay.
Red{nbsp}Hat cannot assist in this measurement or provide any values for the required delay offsets.
====

Each of these `ublxCmds` stanzas correspond to a configuration that is applied to the host NIC by using `ubxtool` commands.
For example:

[source,yaml]
----
ublxCmds:
  - args:
      - "-P"
      - "29.20"
      - "-z"
      - "CFG-HW-ANT_CFG_VOLTCTRL,1"
      - "-z"
      - "CFG-TP-ANT_CABLEDELAY,<antenna_delay_offset>"<1>
    reportOutput: false
----
<1> Measured T-GM antenna delay offset in nanoseconds.
To get the required delay offset value, you must measure the cable delay using external test equipment.

The following table describes the equivalent `ubxtool` commands:

[width="90%", options="header"]
|====
|ubxtool command|Description
|`ubxtool -P 29.20 -z CFG-HW-ANT_CFG_VOLTCTRL,1 -z CFG-TP-ANT_CABLEDELAY,<antenna_delay_offset>`|Enables antenna voltage control, allows antenna status to be reported in the `UBX-MON-RF` and `UBX-INF-NOTICE` log messages, and sets a `<antenna_delay_offset>` value in nanoseconds that offsets the GPS antenna cable signal delay.
|`ubxtool -P 29.20 -e GPS`|Enables the antenna to receive GPS signals.
|`ubxtool -P 29.20 -d Galileo`|Configures the antenna to receive signal from the Galileo GPS satellite.
|`ubxtool -P 29.20 -d GLONASS`|Disables the antenna from receiving signal from the GLONASS GPS satellite.
|`ubxtool -P 29.20 -d BeiDou`|Disables the antenna from receiving signal from the BeiDou GPS satellite.
|`ubxtool -P 29.20 -d SBAS`|Disables the antenna from receiving signal from the SBAS GPS satellite.
|`ubxtool -P 29.20 -t -w 5 -v 1 -e SURVEYIN,600,50000`| Configures the GNSS receiver survey-in process to improve its initial position estimate. This can take up to 24 hours to achieve an optimal result.
|`ubxtool -P 29.20 -p MON-HW`|Runs a single automated scan of the hardware and reports on the NIC state and configuration settings.
