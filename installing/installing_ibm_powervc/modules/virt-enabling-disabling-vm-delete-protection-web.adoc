    * For a virtualization-focused view, select *Administrator* → *Virtualization* → *VirtualMachines*.

    * For a general view, navigate to *Virtualization* → *VirtualMachines*.

. From the *VirtualMachines* list, select the VM whose delete protection you want to enable or disable.

. Click the *Configuration* tab.

. In the *VirtualMachines details*, choose to enable or disable the protection as follows:

* To enable the protection:
.. Set the *Deletion protection* switch to *On*.
.. Click *Enable* to confirm the protection.

 * To disable the protection:
.. Set the *Deletion protection* switch to *Off*.
.. Click *Disable* to disable the protection.
