= Network Observability Operator 1.2.0 known issues

[role="_abstract"]
You can review the following issues and their workarounds, if available, to troubleshoot issues with the Network Observability Operator 1.2.0 release.

* In the 1.2.0 release of the Network Observability Operator, using {loki-op} 5.6, a Loki certificate transition periodically affects the `flowlogs-pipeline` pods and results in dropped flows rather than flows written to Loki. The problem self-corrects after some time, but it still causes temporary flow data loss during the Loki certificate transition. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-980[*NETOBSERV-980*])
