= About collecting MetalLB data

[role="_abstract"]
To collect diagnostic data for debugging or support analysis, execute the `oc adm must-gather` CLI command. This utility captures essential information regarding the cluster, the MetalLB configuration, and the MetalLB Operator state.

The following list details features and objects related to MetalLB and the MetalLB Operator:

* The namespace and child objects where you deploy the MetalLB Operator
* All MetalLB Operator custom resource definitions (CRDs)

The command collects the following information from FRRouting (FRR), which Red{nbsp} Hat uses to implement BGP and BFD:

* `/etc/frr/frr.conf`
* `/etc/frr/frr.log`
* `/etc/frr/daemons` configuration file
* `/etc/frr/vtysh.conf`

The command collects log and configuration files from the `frr` container that exists in each `speaker` pod. Additionally, the command collects the output from the following `vtysh` commands:

* `show running-config`
* `show bgp ipv4`
* `show bgp ipv6`
* `show bgp neighbor`
* `show bfd peer`

No additional configuration is required when you run the command.
