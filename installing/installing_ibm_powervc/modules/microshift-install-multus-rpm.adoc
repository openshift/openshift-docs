= Installing the multiple networks plugin

[role="_abstract"]
You can install the {microshift-short} Multus Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin alongside a new {microshift-short} installation. If you want to attach additional networks to a pod for high-performance network configurations, install the `microshift-multus` RPM package.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {microshift-short} Multus CNI plugin manifests are included in the {microshift-short} binary. To enable multiple networks, you can either set the value in the {microshift-short} `config.yaml` file to `Enabled`, or use the configuration snippet in the `microshift-multus` RPM. Uninstalling the {microshift-short} Multus CNI is not supported in either case.
====

.Procedure

* Install the Multus RPM package by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo dnf install microshift-multus
----
+
[TIP]
====
If you create your custom resources (CRs) while you are completing your installation of {microshift-short}, you can avoid restarting the service to apply them.
====

.Next steps

* Continue with your new {microshift-short} installation, including any add-ons.
* Create the custom resources (CRs) needed for your {microshift-short} Multus CNI plugin.
* Configure other networking CNIs as needed.
* After you have finished installing all of the RPMs that you want to include, start the {microshift-short} service. The {microshift-short} Multus CNI plugin is automatically deployed.
