New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

[NOTE]
====
If you have custom `FRRConfiguration` CRs in the `metallb-system` namespace, you must move them under the `openshift-network-operator` namespace.

Description::

* The cluster is configured for dual-stack IP (IPv4 and IPv6).
* The validated physical network configuration consists of two dual-port NICs.
One NIC is shared among the primary CNI (OVN-Kubernetes) and IPVLAN and MACVLAN traffic, while the second one is dedicated to SR-IOV VF-based pod traffic.
* A Linux bonding interface (`bond0`) is created in active-active IEEE 802.3ad LACP mode with the two NIC ports attached.
The top-of-rack networking equipment must support and be configured for multi-chassis link aggregation (mLAG) technology.
* VLAN interfaces are created on top of `bond0`, including for the primary CNI.
* Bond and VLAN interfaces are created at cluster install time during the network configuration stage of the installation.
Except for the `vlan0` VLAN used by the primary CNI, all other VLANs can be created during Day 2 activities with the Kubernetes NMstate Operator.
* MACVLAN and IPVLAN interfaces are created with their corresponding CNIs.
They do not share the same base interface.
For more information, see "Cluster Network Operator".
* SR-IOV VFs are managed by the SR-IOV Network Operator.
* To ensure consistent source IP addresses for pods behind a LoadBalancer Service, configure an `EgressIP` CR and specify the `podSelector` parameter.
EgressIP is further discussed in the "Cluster Network Operator" section.
* You can implement service traffic separation by doing the following:
.. Configure VLAN interfaces and specific kernel IP routes on the nodes using `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` CRs.
.. Create a MetalLB `BGPPeer` CR for each VLAN to establish peering with the remote BGP router.
.. Define a MetalLB `BGPAdvertisement` CR to specify which IP address pools should be advertised to a selected list of `BGPPeer` resources. The following diagram illustrates how specific service IP addresses are advertised externally through specific VLAN interfaces. Services routes are defined in `BGPAdvertisement` CRs and configured with values for `IPAddressPool1` and `BGPPeer1` fields.
