= Network Observability Operator 1.7.0 fixed issues

[role="_abstract"]
You can review the following fixed issues for the Network Observability Operator 1.7.0 release.

* Previously, when using a {op-system-base} 9.2 real-time kernel, some of the webhooks did not work. Now, a fix is in place to check whether this {op-system-base} 9.2 real-time kernel is being used. If the kernel is being used, a warning is displayed about the features that do not work, such as packet drop and neither Round-trip Time when using `s390x` architecture. The fix is in OpenShift 4.16 and later. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1808[*NETOBSERV-1808*])
* Previously, in the *Manage panels* dialog in the *Overview* tab, filtering on *total*, *bar*, *donut*, or *line* did not show a result. Now the available panels are correctly filtered. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1540[*NETOBSERV-1540*])
* Previously, under high stress, the eBPF agents were susceptible to enter into a state where they generated a high number of small flows, almost not aggregated. With this fix, the aggregation process is still maintained under high stress, resulting in less flows being created. This fix improves the resource consumption not only in the eBPF agent but also in `flowlogs-pipeline` and Loki. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1564[*NETOBSERV-1564*])
* Previously, when the `workload_flows_total` metric was enabled instead of the `namespace_flows_total` metric, the health dashboard stopped showing `By namespace` flow charts. With this fix, the health dashboard now shows the flow charts when the `workload_flows_total` is enabled. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1746[*NETOBSERV-1746*])
* Previously, when you used the `FlowMetrics` API to generate a custom metric and later modified its labels, such as by adding a new label, the metric stopped populating and an error was shown in the `flowlogs-pipeline` logs. With this fix, you can modify the labels, and the error is no longer raised in the `flowlogs-pipeline` logs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1748[*NETOBSERV-1748*])
* Previously, there was an inconsistency with the default Loki `WriteBatchSize` configuration: it was set to 100 KB in the `FlowCollector` CRD default, and 10 MB in the OLM sample or default configuration. Both are now aligned to 10 MB, which generally provides better performances and less resource footprint. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1766[*NETOBSERV-1766*])
* Previously, the eBPF flow filter on ports was ignored if you did not specify a protocol. With this fix, you can set eBPF flow filters independently on ports and or protocols. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1779[*NETOBSERV-1779*])
* Previously, traffic from Pods to Services was hidden from the *Topology view*. Only the return traffic from Services to Pods was visible. With this fix, that traffic is correctly displayed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1788[*NETOBSERV-1788*])
* Previously, non-cluster administrator users that had access to Network Observability saw an error in the console plugin when they tried to filter for something that triggered auto-completion, such as a namespace. With this fix, no error is displayed, and the auto-completion returns the expected results. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1798[*NETOBSERV-1798*])
* When the secondary interface support was added, you had to iterate multiple times to register the per network namespace with the netlink to learn about interface notifications. At the same time, unsuccessful handlers caused a leaking file descriptor because with TCX hook, unlike TC, handlers needed to be explicitly removed when the interface went down. Furthermore, when the network namespace was deleted, there was no Go close channel event to terminate the netlink goroutine socket, which caused go threads to leak. Now, there are no longer leaking file descriptors or go threads when you create or delete pods. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1805[*NETOBSERV-1805*])
* Previously, the ICMP type and value were displaying 'n/a' in the *Traffic flows* table even when related data was available in the flow JSON. With this fix, ICMP columns display related values as expected in the flow table. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1806[*NETOBSERV-1806*])
* Previously in the console plugin, it wasn't always possible to filter for unset fields, such as unset DNS latency. With this fix, filtering on unset fields is now possible. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1816[*NETOBSERV-1816*])
* Previously, when you cleared filters in the OpenShift web console plugin, sometimes the filters reappeared after you navigated to another page and returned to the page with filters. With this fix, filters do not unexpectedly reappear after they are cleared. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1733[*NETOBSERV-1733*])
