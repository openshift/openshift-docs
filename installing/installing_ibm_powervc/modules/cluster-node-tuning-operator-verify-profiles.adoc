* `NAME`: Name of the Profile object. There is one Profile object per node and their names match.
* `TUNED`: Name of the desired TuneD profile to apply.
* `APPLIED`: `True` if the TuneD daemon applied the desired profile. (`True/False/Unknown`).
* `DEGRADED`: `True` if any errors were reported during application of the TuneD profile (`True/False/Unknown`).
* `AGE`: Time elapsed since the creation of Profile object.

The `ClusterOperator/node-tuning` object also contains useful information about the Operator and its node agents' health. For example, Operator misconfiguration is reported by `ClusterOperator/node-tuning` status messages.

To get status information about the `ClusterOperator/node-tuning` object, run the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get co/node-tuning -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
----

.Example output
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
NAME          VERSION   AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   DEGRADED   SINCE   MESSAGE
node-tuning   {product-version}.1    True        False         True       60m     1/5 Profiles with bootcmdline conflict
----

If either the `ClusterOperator/node-tuning` or a profile object's status is `DEGRADED`, additional information is provided in the Operator or operand logs.
