= About offline deployments with {op-system-ostree}

[role="_abstract"]
Embedding {microshift-short} containers in an `rpm-ostree` commit means that you can run a node in disconnected or offline environments.

You can embed {product-title} containers in a {op-system-ostree-first} image so that container engines do not need to pull images over a network from a container registry. Workloads can start immediately without network connectivity.
