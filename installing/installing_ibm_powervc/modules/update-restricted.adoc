[id="update-disconnected_{context}"]
= Updating the disconnected cluster

Update the disconnected cluster to the {product-title} version that you downloaded the release images for.

//TODO: Add xrefs in the following note when functionality is enabled.

[NOTE]
====
If you have a local OpenShift Update Service, you can update by using the connected web console or CLI instructions instead of this procedure.
====

.Prerequisites

* You mirrored the images for the new release to your registry.
* You applied the release image signature ConfigMap for the new release to your cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
The release image signature config map allows the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) to ensure the integrity of release images by verifying that the actual image signatures match the expected signatures.
====
* You obtained the sha256 digest for your targeted release image.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You paused all `MachineHealthCheck` resources.

.Procedure

* Update the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade --allow-explicit-upgrade --to-image <defined_registry>/<defined_repository>@<digest>
----
+
--
Where:

`<defined_registry>`:: Specifies the name of the mirror registry you mirrored your images to.

`<defined_repository>`:: Specifies the name of the image repository you want to use on the mirror registry.

`<digest>`:: Specifies the sha256 digest for the targeted release image, for example, `sha256:81154f5c03294534e1eaf0319bef7a601134f891689ccede5d705ef659aa8c92`.
--
+
[NOTE]
====
* See "Mirroring {product-title} images" to review how your mirror registry and repository names are defined.

* If you used an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` or `ImageDigestMirrorSet`, you can use the canonical registry and repository names instead of the names you defined.
The canonical registry name is `quay.io` and the canonical repository name is `openshift-release-dev/ocp-release`.

* You can only configure global pull secrets for clusters that have an `ImageContentSourcePolicy`, `ImageDigestMirrorSet`, or `ImageTagMirrorSet` object. You cannot add a pull secret to a project.
