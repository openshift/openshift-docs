= Monitoring the status of DPU

[role="_abstract"]
You can monitor the DPU infrastructure status to check the current state and health of your DPU devices across the cluster.

You can monitor the DPU status to see the current state of the DPU infrastructure.

The `oc get dpu` command shows the current state of the DPU infrastructure. Follow this procedure to monitor the status of various cards.

.Prerequisites

* The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) is installed.
* An account with `cluster-admin` privileges is available.
* The DPU Operator is installed.

.Procedure

. Run the following command to check the overall health of your nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----
+
The example output provides a list of all nodes in the cluster along with their status. Ensure that all nodes are in the `Ready` state before proceeding.

This output shows three master nodes, and three worker nodes identified by the worker-host prefix, for example, `worker-host-ipu-219`. Each worker node contains a DPU identified by the ocpcluster-dpu prefix, for example, `ocpcluster-dpu-ipu-219`.

. Run the following command to report on the status of the DPUs:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get dpu

The example output provides a list of detected DPUs.

* `DPU PRODUCT`:Displays the vendor or type of DPU, for example, Intel or Marvell.
* `DPU SIDE`:Indicates whether the DPU is operating on the host side (`false`) or the DPU side (`true`). Each physical DPU is represented twice.
* `MODE NAME`:The name of the node where the DPU is located. This is the host worker node for `false` entries and the DPU node for `true` entries.
* `STATUS`:Indicates whether the DPU is functioning correctly (`True`) or has issues (`False`).

[NOTE]
====
Run `oc get dpu -o yaml` to get more details about the status.
