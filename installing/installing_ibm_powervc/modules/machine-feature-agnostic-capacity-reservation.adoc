= Capacity Reservation configuration options

{product-title} version {product-version} and later supports
ifdef::azure[on-demand Capacity Reservation with Capacity Reservation groups on {azure-full} clusters.]
ifdef::aws[Capacity Reservations on {aws-full} clusters, including On-Demand Capacity Reservations and Capacity Blocks for ML.]

You can deploy machines on any available resources that match the parameters of a capacity request that you define.
These parameters specify the 
ifdef::azure[VM size,]
ifdef::aws[instance type,]
region, and number of instances that you want to reserve.
If your 
ifdef::azure[{azure-short} subscription quota]
ifdef::aws[Capacity Reservation]
can accommodate the capacity request, the deployment succeeds.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot change an existing Capacity Reservation configuration for a machine set. 
To use a different Capacity Reservation group, you must replace the machine set and the machines that the previous machine set deployed.

    spec:
      capacityReservationId: <capacity_reservation> # <1>
      capacityReservationPreference: <reservation_preference> # <2>

# ...
----
<1> Specify the ID of the 
ifdef::azure[Capacity Reservation group]
ifdef::aws[Capacity Block for ML or On-Demand Capacity Reservation]
that you want to deploy machines on.
ifdef::aws[]
<2> Specify your preferred capacity reservation behavior.
The following values are valid:
`CapacityReservationsOnly`:: Use this option to require a matching capacity reservation.
If no matching capacity reservation is available, the instance fails to launch.
`Open`:: Use this option to allow using an open capacity reservation that matches the availability zone and instance type.
`None`:: Use this option to prohibit using a capacity reservation.
You might use this option to help keep capacity reservations available for workloads that you want to use them.
<3> Specify the market type to use.
The following values are valid:
`CapacityBlock`:: Use this market type with Capacity Blocks for ML.
`OnDemand`:: Use this market type with On-Demand Capacity Reservations.
`Spot`:: Use this market type with Spot Instances.
This option is not compatible with Capacity Reservations.
