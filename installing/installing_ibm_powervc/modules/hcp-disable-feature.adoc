[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch mce multiclusterengine --type=merge -p \// <1>
  '{"spec":{"overrides":{"components":[{"name":"hypershift","enabled": false}]}}}'
----
+
<1> The default `MultiClusterEngine` resource instance name is `multiclusterengine`, but you can get the `MultiClusterEngine` name from your cluster by running the following command: `$ oc get mce`.

. You can verify that the `hypershift` and `hypershift-local-hosting` features are disabled in the `MultiClusterEngine` custom resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get mce multiclusterengine -o yaml <1>

<1> The default `MultiClusterEngine` resource instance name is `multiclusterengine`, but you can get the `MultiClusterEngine` name from your cluster by running the following command: `$ oc get mce`.
