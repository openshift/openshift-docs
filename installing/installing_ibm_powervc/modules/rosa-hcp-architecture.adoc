[id="rosa-hcp-architecture_{context}"]
= {product-title} with HCP architecture

{product-title} hosts a highly-available, single-tenant OpenShift control plane. The hosted control plane is deployed across 3 availability zones with 2 API server instances and 3 etcd instances.

You can create a {product-title} cluster with or without an internet-facing API server, with the latter considered a “private” cluster and the former considered a “public” cluster. Private API servers are only accessible from your VPC subnets. You access the hosted control plane through an AWS PrivateLink endpoint regardless of API privacy.

The worker nodes are deployed in your AWS account and run on your VPC private subnets. You can add additional private subnets from one or more availability zones to ensure high availability. Worker nodes are shared by OpenShift components and applications. OpenShift components such as the ingress controller, image registry, and monitoring are deployed on the worker nodes hosted on your VPC.
