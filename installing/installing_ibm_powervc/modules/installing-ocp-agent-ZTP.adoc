= Using ZTP manifests

As an optional task, you can use {ztp-first} manifests to configure your installation beyond the options available through the `install-config.yaml` and `agent-config.yaml` files.

[NOTE]
====
{ztp} manifests can be generated with or without configuring the `install-config.yaml` and `agent-config.yaml` files beforehand.
If you chose to configure the `install-config.yaml` and `agent-config.yaml` files, the configurations will be imported to the ZTP cluster manifests when they are generated.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have placed the `openshift-install` binary in a directory that is on your `PATH`.

* Optional: You have created and configured the `install-config.yaml` and `agent-config.yaml` files.

.Procedure

. Generate ZTP cluster manifests by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install agent create cluster-manifests --dir <installation_directory>
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have created the `install-config.yaml` and `agent-config.yaml` files, those files are deleted and replaced by the cluster manifests generated through this command.

Any configurations made to the `install-config.yaml` and `agent-config.yaml` files are imported to the ZTP cluster manifests when you run the `openshift-install agent create cluster-manifests` command.
====

. Navigate to the `cluster-manifests` directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd <installation_directory>/cluster-manifests
----

. Configure the manifest files in the `cluster-manifests` directory.
For sample files, see the "Sample GitOps ZTP custom resources" section.

. Disconnected clusters: If you did not define mirror configuration in the `install-config.yaml` file before generating the ZTP manifests, perform the following steps:

.. Navigate to the `mirror` directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd ../mirror
----

.. Configure the manifest files in the `mirror` directory.
