= Private {product-title} on {GCP} architecture on public and private networks

[role="_abstract"]
You can customize the access patterns for your API server endpoint and Red Hat SRE management by choosing one of the following network configuration types:

* Private cluster with Private Service Connect (PSC).
* Private cluster without PSC
* Public cluster

[IMPORTANT]
====
Red Hat recommends using PSC when deploying a private {product-title} cluster on {GCP}. PSC ensures there is a secured, private connectivity between Red Hat infrastructure, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), and private OpenShift clusters.
