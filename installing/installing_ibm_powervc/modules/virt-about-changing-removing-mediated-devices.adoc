= About changing and removing mediated devices

[role="_abstract"]
As an administrator, you can change or remove mediated devices by editing the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR).

You can reconfigure or remove mediated devices in several ways:

* Edit the `HyperConverged` CR and change the contents of the `mediatedDeviceTypes` stanza.

* Change the node labels that match the `nodeMediatedDeviceTypes` node selector.

* Remove the device information from the `spec.mediatedDevicesConfiguration` and `spec.permittedHostDevices` stanzas of the `HyperConverged` CR.

[NOTE]
====
If you remove the device information from the `spec.permittedHostDevices` stanza without also removing it from the `spec.mediatedDevicesConfiguration` stanza, you cannot create a new mediated device type on the same node. To properly remove mediated devices, remove the device information from both stanzas.
