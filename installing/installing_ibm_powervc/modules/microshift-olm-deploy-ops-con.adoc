= How to deploy Operators using OLM

[role="_abstract"]
After you create and deploy your custom catalog, you must create a Subscription custom resource (CR) that can access the catalog and install the Operators you choose. Where Operators run depends on the namespace in which you create the Subscription CR.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Operators that you are managing with Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) have a watch scope. For example, some Operators only support watching their own namespace, while others support watching every namespace in the node. All Operators installed in a given namespace must have the same watch scope.

== Connectivity and OLM Operator deployment

You can deplpy Operators anywhere a catalog is running.

* For a node that is connected to the internet, mirroring images is not required. Images can be pulled over the network.
* For restricted networks in which {microshift-short} has access to an internal network only, images must be mirrored to an internal registry.
* For use cases in which a {microshift-short} node is completely offline, all images must be embedded into an `osbuild` blueprint or a Containerfile.
//osbuild is removed with RHEL 10/MS 4.21
