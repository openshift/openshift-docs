= Ingress sharding and DNS

[role="_abstract"]
To ensure ingress traffic reaches the correct router in {product-title}, create separate DNS entries for each router in your project. Because a router does not forward unknown traffic to other routers, distinct entries are required to resolve specific domains to their hosting nodes."

Consider the following example:

* Router A lives on host 192.168.0.5 and has routes with `*.foo.com`.
* Router B lives on host 192.168.1.9 and has routes with `*.example.com`.

Separate DNS entries must resolve `\*.foo.com` to the node hosting Router A and `*.example.com` to the node hosting Router B:

* `*.foo.com A IN 192.168.0.5`
* `*.example.com A IN 192.168.1.9`
