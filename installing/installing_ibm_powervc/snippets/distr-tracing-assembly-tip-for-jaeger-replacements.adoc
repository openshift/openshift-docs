The deprecated {JaegerName} 3.5 was the last release of the {JaegerName} that Red Hat supported.

All support and maintenance for the deprecated {JaegerName} 3.5 ended on November 3, 2025.

If you still use {JaegerName}, you must migrate to {OTELOperator} and {TempoOperator} for distributed tracing collection and storage. For more information, see "Migrating" in the {OTELName} documentation, "Installing" in the {OTELName} documentation, and "Installing" in the {TempoName} documentation.
