In {product-title} {product-version}.{olm-np-z}, {olmv0-first} and {olmv1} support the inclusion of network policy manifests in the resource bundles of Operators. These tailored network policies protect against data leaks and harden against many attack vectors on {product-title} clusters.

[TIP]
====
If your current version of OLM does not support tailored network policies, a notification is displayed in the following locations:

* The {hybrid-console}
* The web console of the affected cluster

Update to {product-title} {product-version}.{olm-np-z-stream} or later to enable OLM support for tailored network policies.
