As a cluster administrator, you can install {builds-title} on an {ocp-product-title} cluster.

[id="prerequisites_installing-openshift-builds"]
== Prerequisites

* You have access to the {ocp-product-title} web console.
* You have installed the `oc` CLI.
* You are logged in to the {ocp-product-title} cluster as an administrator.
* Your cluster has the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/installing/cluster-capabilities.html#marketplace-operator_cluster-capabilities[Marketplace capability] enabled or the Red Hat Operator catalog source configured manually.

[NOTE]
====
As a dependency component, the {pipelines-operator} is automatically installed along with the {builds-operator} during installation. If you have already installed the {pipelines-operator}, {builds-shortname} uses that Operator for its functioning.
