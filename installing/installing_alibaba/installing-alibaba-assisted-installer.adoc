You can install an OpenShift cluster on Alibaba Cloud using the {OCP-short} {ai-full}. 
The process is as follows: 

. Create the cluster with {OCP-short} {ai-full} and download the generated image.

. Convert the generated image to `QCOW2` format.

. Create the infrastructure resources using the image from the {ai-full}.

. Complete the cluster configuration and installation with {ai-full}. 

You can also help automate the process using the Alibaba Resource Orchestration Service. After installation, the {OCP-short} cluster is ready for use. 

The configuration this section is a reference implementation for a quick start. More resources can be added to cover specific applications or business requirements.
