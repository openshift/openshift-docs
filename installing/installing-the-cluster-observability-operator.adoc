As a cluster administrator, you can install or remove the {coo-first} from OperatorHub by using the {ocp-product-title} web console.
OperatorHub is a user interface that works in conjunction with Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), which installs and manages Operators on a cluster.

[NOTE]
====
For {ocp-product-title} v4.20+, you can install an Operator using the software catalog.
