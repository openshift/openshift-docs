Running your cluster in a restricted network without direct internet connectivity is possible by installing the cluster from a mirrored set of {product-title} container images in a private registry. This registry must be running at all times as long as the cluster is running. See the xref:../../installing/disconnected_install/installing-mirroring-disconnected.adoc#prerequisites_installing-mirroring-disconnected[Prerequisites] section for more information.

You can use the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (`oc`) plugin to mirror images to a mirror registry in your fully or partially disconnected environments. You must run oc-mirror from a system with internet connectivity in order to download the required images from the official Red Hat registries.

The following steps outline the high-level workflow on how to use the oc-mirror plugin to mirror images to a mirror registry:

. Create an image set configuration file.
. Mirror the image set to the mirror registry by using one of the following methods:
** Mirror an image set directly to the mirror registry.
** Mirror an image set to disk, transfer the image set to the target environment, then upload the image set to the target mirror registry.
. Configure your cluster to use the resources generated by the oc-mirror plugin.
. Repeat these steps to update your mirror registry as necessary.

== Prerequisites

* You must have a container image registry that supports link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2[Docker v2-2] in the location that will host the {product-title} cluster, such as Red Hat Quay.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you use Red Hat Quay, you must use version 3.6 or later with the oc-mirror plugin. If you have an entitlement to Red Hat Quay, see the documentation on deploying Red Hat Quay link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/deploy_red_hat_quay_for_proof-of-concept_non-production_purposes/[for proof-of-concept purposes] or link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/deploying_the_red_hat_quay_operator_on_openshift_container_platform/index[by using the Red Hat Quay Operator]. If you need additional assistance selecting and installing a registry, contact your sales representative or Red Hat Support.
====
+
If you do not already have an existing solution for a container image registry, subscribers of {product-title} are provided a xref:../../installing/disconnected_install/installing-mirroring-creating-registry.adoc#installing-mirroring-creating-registry[mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift]. The _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ is included with your subscription and is a small-scale container registry that can be used to mirror the required container images of {product-title} in disconnected installations.

== Preparing your mirror hosts

Before you can use the oc-mirror plugin to mirror images, you must install the plugin and create a container image registry credentials file to allow the mirroring from Red Hat to your mirror.

== Mirroring an image set to a mirror registry

You can use the oc-mirror CLI plugin to mirror images to a mirror registry in a xref:../../installing/disconnected_install/installing-mirroring-disconnected.adoc#mirroring-image-set-partial[partially disconnected environment] or in a xref:../../installing/disconnected_install/installing-mirroring-disconnected.adoc#mirroring-image-set-full[fully disconnected environment].

These procedures assume that you already have your mirror registry set up.

[id="mirroring-image-set-partial"]
=== Mirroring an image set in a partially disconnected environment

In a partially disconnected environment, you can mirror an image set directly to the target mirror registry.

// Mirroring from mirror to mirror
include::modules/oc-mirror-mirror-to-mirror.adoc[leveloffset=+3]

[id="mirroring-image-set-full"]
=== Mirroring an image set in a fully disconnected environment

To mirror an image set in a fully disconnected environment, you must first xref:../../installing/disconnected_install/installing-mirroring-disconnected.adoc#oc-mirror-mirror-to-disk_installing-mirroring-disconnected[mirror the image set to disk], then xref:../../installing/disconnected_install/installing-mirroring-disconnected.adoc#oc-mirror-disk-to-mirror_installing-mirroring-disconnected[mirror the image set file on disk to a mirror].

[id="updating-mirror-registry-content"]
== Keeping your mirror registry content updated

After your target mirror registry is populated with the initial image set, be sure to update it regularly so that it has the latest content. You can optionally set up a cron job, if possible, so that the mirror registry is updated on a regular basis.

Ensure that you update your image set configuration to add or remove {product-title} and Operator releases as necessary. Any images that are removed are pruned from the mirror registry.
