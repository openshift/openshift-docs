Running your cluster in a restricted network without direct internet connectivity is possible by installing the cluster from a mirrored set of {product-title} container images in a private registry. This registry must be running at all times as long as the cluster is running. See "Prerequisites" section for more information.

== Prerequisites

* You must have a container image registry, which is referred as the mirror registry, that supports link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2[Docker v2-2] in the location that hosts the {product-title} cluster, such as {quay}.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you use {quay}, you must use version 3.6 or later with the oc-mirror plugin. If you have an entitlement to {quay}, see the documentation on deploying {quay} link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/deploy_red_hat_quay_for_proof-of-concept_non-production_purposes/[for proof-of-concept purposes] or link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/deploying_the_red_hat_quay_operator_on_openshift_container_platform/index[by using the Red Hat Quay Operator]. If you need additional assistance selecting and installing a registry, contact your sales representative or Red Hat Support.
====
+
If you do not already have an existing solution for a mirror registry, the subscribers of {product-title} are provided in "Creating a mirror registry with mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift".

* The mirror registry must be reachable by every machine in the clusters that you provision. If the registry is unreachable, installation, updating, or normal operations such as workload relocation might fail. For this reason, you must run mirror registries ensuring highly availability. The mirror registries must meet or exceed the production availability of your {product-title} clusters.

* You have set the umask parameter to `0022` on the operating system that uses oc-mirror plugin v1.

== Preparing your mirror hosts

To use the oc-mirror plugin v1 to mirror images, you need to install the plugin and create a container image registry credentials file to enable mirroring from Red Hat to your mirror.
