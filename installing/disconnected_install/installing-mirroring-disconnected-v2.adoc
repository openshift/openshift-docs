Running your cluster in a restricted network without direct internet connectivity is possible by installing the cluster from a mirrored set of {product-title} container images in a private registry. This registry must be running at all times as long as the cluster is running. See the xref:../../installing/disconnected_install/installing-mirroring-disconnected.adoc#prerequisites_installing-mirroring-disconnected[Prerequisites] section for more information.

You can use the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (`oc`) plugin to mirror images to a mirror registry in your fully or partially disconnected environments. You must run oc-mirror from a system with internet connectivity in order to download the required images from the official Red Hat registries.

The following steps outline the high-level workflow on how to use the oc-mirror plugin to mirror images to a mirror registry:

. Create an image set configuration file.
. Mirror the image set to the mirror registry by using one of the following methods:
** Mirror an image set directly to the mirror registry.
** Mirror an image set to disk, transfer the image set to the target environment, then upload the image set to the target mirror registry.
. Configure your cluster to use the resources generated by the oc-mirror plugin.
. Repeat these steps to update your mirror registry as necessary.

== Prerequisites

* You must have a container image registry that supports link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2[Docker v2-2] in the location that will host the {product-title} cluster, such as Red Hat Quay.

[NOTE]
====
If you use Red Hat Quay, you must use version 3.6 or later with the oc-mirror plugin. If you have an entitlement to Red Hat Quay, see the documentation on deploying Red Hat Quay link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/deploy_red_hat_quay_for_proof-of-concept_non-production_purposes/[for proof-of-concept purposes] or link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/deploying_the_red_hat_quay_operator_on_openshift_container_platform/index[by using the Red Hat Quay Operator]. If you need additional assistance selecting and installing a registry, contact your sales representative or Red Hat Support.

If you do not already have an existing solution for a container image registry, subscribers of {product-title} are provided a xref:../../installing/disconnected_install/installing-mirroring-creating-registry.adoc#installing-mirroring-creating-registry[mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift]. The _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ is included with your subscription and is a small-scale container registry that can be used to mirror the required container images of {product-title} in disconnected installations.
