toc::[]

You can install an {product-title} cluster that uses FIPS Validated / Modules in Process cryptographic libraries on the `x86_64` architecture.

For the {op-system-first} machines in your cluster, this change is applied when the machines are deployed based on the status of an option in the `install-config.yaml` file, which governs the cluster options that a user can change during cluster deployment. With {op-system-base-full} machines, you must enable FIPS mode when you install the operating system on the machines that you plan to use as worker machines. These configuration methods ensure that your cluster meet the requirements of a FIPS compliance audit: only FIPS Validated / Modules in Process cryptography packages are enabled before the initial system boot.

Because FIPS must be enabled before the operating system that your cluster uses boots for the first time, you cannot enable FIPS after you deploy a cluster.

== FIPS validation in {product-title}

{product-title} uses certain FIPS Validated / Modules in Process modules within {op-system-base} and {op-system} for the operating system components that it uses. See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/3655361[RHEL8 core crypto components]. For example, when users SSH into {product-title} clusters and containers, those connections are properly encrypted.

{product-title} components are written in Go and built with Red Hat's golang compiler. When you enable FIPS mode for your cluster, all {product-title} components that require cryptographic signing call {op-system-base} and {op-system} cryptographic libraries.

|Attributes
|Limitations

|FIPS support in {op-system-base} 7, {op-system-base} 8, and {op-system} operating systems.
.3+|The FIPS implementation does not offer a single function that both computes hash functions and validates the keys that are based on that hash. This limitation will continue to be evaluated and improved in future {product-title} releases.

|FIPS support in CRI-O runtimes.
|FIPS support in {product-title} services.

|FIPS Validated / Modules in Process cryptographic module and algorithms that are obtained from {op-system-base} 7, {op-system-base} 8, and {op-system} binaries and images.
|

|Use of FIPS compatible golang compiler.
|TLS FIPS support is not complete but is planned for future {product-title} releases.

|FIPS support across multiple architectures.
|FIPS is currently only supported on {product-title} deployments using the `x86_64` architecture.

[id="installation-about-fips-components_{context}"]
==  FIPS support in components that the cluster uses

Although the {product-title} cluster itself uses FIPS Validated / Modules in Process modules, ensure that the systems that support your {product-title} cluster use FIPS Validated / Modules in Process modules for cryptography.

[id="installation-about-fips-components-etcd_{context}"]
=== etcd

To ensure that the secrets that are stored in etcd use FIPS Validated / Modules in Process encryption, boot the node in FIPS mode. After you install the cluster in FIPS mode, you can xref:../security/encrypting-etcd.adoc#encrypting-etcd[encrypt the etcd data] by using the FIPS-approved `aes cbc` cryptographic algorithm.

[id="installation-about-fips-components-storage_{context}"]
=== Storage

For local storage, use {op-system-base}-provided disk encryption or Container Native Storage that uses {op-system-base}-provided disk encryption. By storing all data in volumes that use {op-system-base}-provided disk encryption and enabling FIPS mode for your cluster, both data at rest and data in motion, or network data, are protected by FIPS Validated / Modules in Process encryption.
You can configure your cluster to encrypt the root filesystem of each node, as described
in xref:../installing/install_config/installing-customizing.adoc#installing-customizing[Customizing nodes].

[id="installation-about-fips-components-runtimes_{context}"]
=== Runtimes

To ensure that containers know that they are running on a host that is using FIPS Validated / Modules in Process cryptography modules, use CRI-O to manage your runtimes. CRI-O supports FIPS mode, in that it configures the containers to know that they are running in FIPS mode.

[id="installing-fips-mode_{context}"]
==  Installing a cluster in FIPS mode

To install a cluster in FIPS mode, follow the instructions to install a customized cluster on your preferred infrastructure. Ensure that you set `fips: true` in the `install-config.yaml` file before you deploy your cluster.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using Azure File storage, you cannot enable FIPS mode.
====

To apply `AES CBC` encryption to your etcd data store, follow the xref:../security/encrypting-etcd.adoc#encrypting-etcd[Encrypting etcd data] process after you install your cluster.

If you add {op-system-base} nodes to your cluster, ensure that you enable FIPS mode on the machines before their initial boot.
