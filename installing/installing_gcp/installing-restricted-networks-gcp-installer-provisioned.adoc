In {product-title} {product-version}, you can install a cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) in a restricted network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content on an existing Google Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can install an {product-title} cluster by using mirrored installation release content, but your cluster will require internet access to use the GCP APIs.

[id="prerequisites_installing-restricted-networks-gcp-installer-provisioned"]
== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:../../installing/installing-mirroring-installation-images.adoc#installation-about-mirror-registry_installing-mirroring-installation-images[mirrored the images for a disconnected installation] to your registry and obtained the `imageContentSources` data and installation media for your version of {product-title}.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the installation media is on the mirror registry host, you can use that computer to complete all installation steps.
====
* You have an existing VPC in GCP. While installing a cluster in a restricted network that uses installer-provisioned infrastructure, you cannot use the installer-provisioned VPC. You must use a user-provisioned VPC that satisfies one of the following requirements:
** Contains the mirror registry
** Has firewall rules or a peering connection to access the mirror registry hosted elsewhere
* If you use a firewall, you xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to. While you might need to grant access to more sites, you must grant access to `*.googleapis.com` and `accounts.google.com`.
* If the cloud identity and access management (IAM) APIs are not accessible in your environment, or if you do not want to store an administrator-level credential secret in the `kube-system` namespace, you can xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/manually-creating-iam-gcp.adoc#manually-creating-iam-gcp[manually create and maintain IAM credentials].
