toc::[]

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) by using infrastructure that you provide.

The steps for performing a user-provided infrastructure install are outlined here. Several
link:https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs[Deployment Manager] templates are provided to assist in
completing these steps or to help model your own. You are also free to create
the required resources through other methods; the templates are just an
example.

[id="csr-management-aws_{context}"]
== Certificate signing requests management

Because your cluster has limited access to automatic machine management when you
use infrastructure that you provision, you must provide a mechanism for approving
cluster certificate signing requests (CSRs) after installation. The
`kube-controller-manager` only approves the kubelet client CSRs. The
`machine-approver` cannot guarantee the validity of a serving certificate
that is requested by using kubelet credentials because it cannot confirm that
the correct machine issued the request. You must determine and implement a
method of verifying the validity of the kubelet serving certificate requests
and approving them.

== Configuring your GCP project

Before you can install {product-title}, you must configure a Google Cloud
Platform (GCP) project to host it.
