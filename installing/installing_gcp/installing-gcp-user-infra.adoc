= Installing a cluster on user-provisioned infrastructure in GCP by using Deployment Manager templates
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: installing-gcp-user-infra

toc::[]

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that uses infrastructure that you provide.

The steps for performing a user-provided infrastructure install are outlined here. Several link:https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs[Deployment Manager] templates are provided to assist in completing these steps or to help model your own. You are also free to create the required resources through other methods.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The steps for performing a user-provisioned infrastructure installation are provided as an example only. Installing a cluster with infrastructure you provide requires knowledge of the cloud provider and the installation process of {product-title}. Several Deployment Manager templates are provided to assist in completing these steps or to help model your own. You are also free to create the required resources through other methods; the templates are just an example.
====

== Prerequisites

* Review details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* If you use a firewall and plan to use telemetry, you must xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configure the firewall to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
* If you do not allow the system to manage identity and access management (IAM), then a cluster administrator can xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/manually-creating-iam-gcp.adoc#manually-creating-iam-gcp[manually create and maintain IAM credentials]. Manual mode can also be used in environments where the cloud IAM APIs are not reachable.

Be sure to also review this site list if you are configuring a proxy.
