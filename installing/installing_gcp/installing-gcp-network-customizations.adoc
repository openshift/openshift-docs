toc::[]

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster with a
customized network configuration on infrastructure that the installation program
provisions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). By customizing your network
configuration, your cluster can coexist with existing IP address allocations in
your environment and integrate with existing MTU and VXLAN configurations. To
customize the installation, you modify parameters in the `install-config.yaml`
file before you install the cluster.

You must set most of the network configuration parameters during installation,
and you can modify only `kubeProxy` configuration parameters in a running
cluster.

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-account.adoc#installing-gcp-account[configured a GCP project] to host the cluster.
* If you use a firewall, you xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.

== Alternatives to storing administrator-level secrets in the kube-system project

By default, administrator secrets are stored in the `kube-system` project. If you configured the `credentialsMode` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` file to `Manual`, you must use one of the following alternatives:

* To manage long-term cloud credentials manually, follow the procedure in xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-network-customizations.adoc#manually-create-iam_installing-gcp-network-customizations[Manually creating long-term credentials].

* To implement short-term credentials that are managed outside the cluster for individual components, follow the procedures in xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-network-customizations.adoc#installing-gcp-with-short-term-creds_installing-gcp-network-customizations[Configuring a GCP cluster to use short-term credentials].

=== Configuring a GCP cluster to use short-term credentials

To install a cluster that is configured to use GCP Workload Identity, you must configure the CCO utility and create the required GCP resources for your cluster.
