toc::[]

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster with a
customized network configuration on infrastructure that the installation program
provisions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). By customizing your network
configuration, your cluster can coexist with existing IP address allocations in
your environment and integrate with existing MTU and VXLAN configurations. To
customize the installation, you modify parameters in the `install-config.yaml`
file before you install the cluster.

You must set most of the network configuration parameters during installation,
and you can modify only `kubeProxy` configuration parameters in a running
cluster.

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-account.adoc#installing-gcp-account[configured a GCP project] to host the cluster.
* If you use a firewall, you xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
* If the cloud identity and access management (IAM) APIs are not accessible in your environment, or if you do not want to store an administrator-level credential secret in the `kube-system` namespace, you can xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/manually-creating-iam-gcp.adoc#manually-creating-iam-gcp[manually create and maintain IAM credentials].
