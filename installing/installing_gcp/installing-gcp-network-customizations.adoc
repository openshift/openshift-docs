In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster with a
customized network configuration on infrastructure that the installation program
provisions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). By customizing your network
configuration, your cluster can coexist with existing IP address allocations in
your environment and integrate with existing MTU and VXLAN configurations. To
customize the installation, you modify parameters in the `install-config.yaml`
file before you install the cluster.

You must set most of the network configuration parameters during installation,
and you can modify only `kubeProxy` configuration parameters in a running
cluster.

== Prerequisites

* Review details about the
xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update]
processes.
* xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-account.adoc#installing-gcp-account[Configure a GCP account]
to host the cluster.
* If you use a firewall, you must
xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configure it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
* If you do not allow the system to manage identity and access management (IAM),
then a cluster administrator can
xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/manually-creating-iam-gcp.adoc#manually-creating-iam-gcp[manually
create and maintain IAM credentials]. Manual mode can also be used in
environments where the cloud IAM APIs are not reachable.
