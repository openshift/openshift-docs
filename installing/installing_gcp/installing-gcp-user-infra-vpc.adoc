= Installing a cluster with shared VPC on user-provisioned infrastructure in GCP by using Deployment Manager templates
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: installing-gcp-user-infra-vpc

toc::[]

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster into a shared Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that uses infrastructure that you provide.

The steps for performing a user-provided infrastructure installation into a shared VPC are outlined here. Several
link:https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs[Deployment Manager] templates are provided to assist in
completing these steps or to help model your own. You are also free to create
the required resources through other methods; the templates are just an
example.

== Prerequisites

* Review details about the
xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update]
processes.
* If you use a firewall and plan to use telemetry, you must
xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configure the firewall to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
* If you do not allow the system to manage identity and access management (IAM),
then a cluster administrator can
xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/manually-creating-iam-gcp.adoc#manually-creating-iam-gcp[manually
create and maintain IAM credentials]. Manual mode can also be used in
environments where the cloud IAM APIs are not reachable.

[NOTE]

Be sure to also review this site list if you are configuring a proxy.

[id="csr-management-gcp-vpc"]
== Certificate signing requests management

Because your cluster has limited access to automatic machine management when you
use infrastructure that you provision, you must provide a mechanism for approving
cluster certificate signing requests (CSRs) after installation. The
`kube-controller-manager` only approves the kubelet client CSRs. The
`machine-approver` cannot guarantee the validity of a serving certificate
that is requested by using kubelet credentials because it cannot confirm that
the correct machine issued the request. You must determine and implement a
method of verifying the validity of the kubelet serving certificate requests
and approving them.

== Configuring the GCP project that hosts your cluster

Before you can install {product-title}, you must configure a Google Cloud
Platform (GCP) project to host it.

[id="installation-gcp-user-infra-vpc-adding-firewall-rules"]
== Adding ingress firewall rules
The cluster requires several firewall rules. If you do not use a shared VPC, these rules are created by the ingress controller via the GCP cloud provider. When you use a shared VPC, you can either create cluster-wide firewall rules for all services now or create each rule based on events, when the cluster requests access. By creating each rule when the cluster requests access, you know exactly which firewall rules are required. By creating cluster-wide firewall rules, you can apply the same rule set across multiple clusters.

If you choose to create each rule based on events, you must create firewall rules after you provision the cluster and during the life of the cluster when the console notifies you that rules are missing. Events that are similar to the following event are displayed, and you must add the firewall rules that are required:

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Firewall change required by security admin: `gcloud compute firewall-rules create k8s-fw-a26e631036a3f46cba28f8df67266d55 --network example-network --description "{\"kubernetes.io/service-name\":\"openshift-ingress/router-default\", \"kubernetes.io/service-ip\":\"35.237.236.234\"}\" --allow tcp:443,tcp:80 --source-ranges 0.0.0.0/0 --target-tags exampl-fqzq7-master,exampl-fqzq7-worker --project example-project`
----

If you encounter issues when creating these rule-based events, you can configure the cluster-wide firewall rules while your cluster is running.
