= Installing a cluster on {gcp-short} into a shared VPC
:context: installing-gcp-shared-vpc
:FeatureName: Installing a cluster on {gcp-short} into a shared VPC

toc::[]

[role="_abstract"]
In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster into a shared Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on {gcp-first}. In this installation method, the cluster is configured to use a VPC from a different {gcp-short} project. A shared VPC enables an organization to connect resources from multiple projects to a common VPC network. You can communicate within the organization securely and efficiently by using internal IP addresses from that network. For more information about shared VPC, see link:https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc[Shared VPC overview in the {gcp-short} documentation].

The installation program provisions the rest of the required infrastructure, which you can further customize. To customize the installation, you modify parameters in the `install-config.yaml` file before you install the cluster.

[id="installation-gcp-shared-vpc-prerequisites_{context}"]
== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/overview/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* If you use a firewall, you xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
* You xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-account.adoc#installing-gcp-account[configured a {gcp-short} project] to host the cluster. This project, known as the service project, must be attached to the host project. For more information, see link:https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/provisioning-shared-vpc#create-shared[Attaching service projects in the {gcp-short} documentation].
* You have a {gcp-short} host project that contains a shared VPC network and that has a configured Cloud Router and Cloud NAT gateway, to ensure that internet access from the VPC is available. For more information, see link:https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/router/concepts/overview[Cloud Router overview] and  link:https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/overview[Cloud NAT overview] (Google documentation).
* You have a {gcp-short} service account that has the xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-account.adoc#minimum-required-permissions-ipi-gcp-xpn_installing-gcp-account[required {gcp-short} permissions] in both the host and service projects.
* If you want to provide your own private hosted zone, you must have created one in the service project with the DNS pattern `cluster-name.baseDomain.`, for example `testCluster.example.com.`. The private hosted zone must be bound to the VPC in the host project. For more information about cross-project binding, see link:https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/zones/cross-project-binding[Create a zone with cross-project binding] (Google documentation). If you do not provide a private hosted zone, the installation program will provision one automatically.
* If you manage your {gcp-short} firewall rules, you xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-account.adoc#installation-gcp-user-managed-firewall-rules_installing-gcp-account[configured the required firewall rules].

== Alternatives to storing administrator-level secrets in the kube-system project

By default, administrator secrets are stored in the `kube-system` project. If you configured the `credentialsMode` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` file to `Manual`, you must use one of the following alternatives:

* To manage long-term cloud credentials manually, follow the procedure in xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-shared-vpc.adoc#manually-create-iam_installing-gcp-shared-vpc[Manually creating long-term credentials].

* To implement short-term credentials that are managed outside the cluster for individual components, follow the procedures in xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-shared-vpc.adoc#installing-gcp-with-short-term-creds_installing-gcp-shared-vpc[Configuring a {gcp-short} cluster to use short-term credentials].

=== Configuring a {gcp-short} cluster to use short-term credentials

To install a cluster that is configured to use {gcp-short} Workload Identity, you must configure the CCO utility and create the required {gcp-short} resources for your cluster.
