:FeatureName: Installing a cluster on GCP into a shared VPC

toc::[]

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster into a shared Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). In this installation method, the cluster is configured to use a VPC from a different GCP project. A shared VPC enables an organization to connect resources from multiple projects to a common VPC network. You can communicate within the organization securely and efficiently by using internal IP addresses from that network. For more information about shared VPC, see link:https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc[Shared VPC overview in the GCP documentation]. 

The installation program provisions the rest of the required infrastructure, which you can further customize. To customize the installation, you modify parameters in the `install-config.yaml` file before you install the cluster.

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* If you use a firewall, you xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
* If the cloud identity and access management (IAM) APIs are not accessible in your environment, or if you do not want to store an administrator-level credential secret in the `kube-system` namespace, you can xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/manually-creating-iam-gcp.adoc#manually-creating-iam-gcp[manually create and maintain IAM credentials].
* You have a GCP host project which contains a shared VPC network.
* You xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-account.adoc#installing-gcp-account[configured a GCP project] to host the cluster. This project, known as the service project, must be attached to the host project. For more information, see link:https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/provisioning-shared-vpc#create-shared[Attaching service projects in the GCP documentation].
* You have a GCP service account that has the xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-account.adoc#installation-gcp-permissions_installing-gcp-account[required GCP permissions] in the host project.
