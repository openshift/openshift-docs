= Configuring the user-defined tags for GCP

In {product-title}, you can use the tags for grouping resources and for managing resource access and cost. You can define the tags on the Azure resources in the `install-config.yaml` file only during {product-title} cluster creation. You cannot modify the user-defined tags after cluster creation.

Support for user-defined tags is available only for the resources created in the Azure Public Cloud. User-defined tags are not supported for the {product-title} clusters upgraded to {product-title} 4.14.

User-defined and {product-title} specific tags are applied only to the resources created by the {product-title} installer and its core operators such as Machine api provider azure Operator, Cluster Ingress Operator, Cluster Image Registry Operator.
