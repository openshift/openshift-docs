= Installing a cluster on GCP in a restricted network with user-provisioned infrastructure
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: installing-restricted-networks-gcp

toc::[]

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that uses infrastructure that you provide and an internal mirror of the installation release content.

[IMPORTANT]
====
While you can install an {product-title} cluster by using mirrored installation release content, your cluster still requires internet access to use the GCP APIs.
====

The steps for performing a user-provided infrastructure install are outlined here. Several link:https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs[Deployment Manager] templates are provided to assist in completing these steps or to help model your own. You are also free to create the required resources through other methods.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The steps for performing a user-provisioned infrastructure installation are provided as an example only. Installing a cluster with infrastructure you provide requires knowledge of the cloud provider and the installation process of {product-title}. Several Deployment Manager templates are provided to assist in completing these steps or to help model your own. You are also free to create the required resources through other methods; the templates are just an example.
====


== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:../../installing/installing-mirroring-installation-images.adoc#installing-mirroring-installation-images[created a registry on your mirror host] and obtained the `imageContentSources` data for your version of {product-title}.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the installation media is on the mirror registry host, you can use that computer to complete all installation steps.
====
* If you use a firewall, you xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to. While you might need to grant access to more sites, you must grant access to `*.googleapis.com` and `accounts.google.com`.
* If the cloud identity and access management (IAM) APIs are not accessible in your environment, or if you do not want to store an administrator-level credential secret in the `kube-system` namespace, you can xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/manually-creating-iam-gcp.adoc#manually-creating-iam-gcp[manually create and maintain IAM credentials].

== Configuring your GCP project

Before you can install {product-title}, you must configure a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project to host it.
