In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that uses infrastructure that you provide and an internal mirror of the installation release content.

[IMPORTANT]
====
While you can install an {product-title} cluster by using mirrored installation
release content, your cluster still requires internet access to use the GCP APIs.
====

The steps for performing a user-provided infrastructure install are outlined here. Several
link:https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs[Deployment Manager] templates are provided to assist in
completing these steps or to help model your own. You are also free to create
the required resources through other methods; the templates are just an
example.

== Prerequisites

* xref:../../installing/install_config/installing-restricted-networks-preparations.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-preparations[Create a mirror registry on your bastion host]
 and obtain the `imageContentSources` data for your version of {product-title}.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the installation media is on the bastion host, use that computer
to complete all installation steps.
====
* Review details about the
xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update]
processes.
* If you use a firewall, you must
xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configure it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to. While you might need to grant access to more sites, you must grant access to `*.googleapis.com` and `accounts.google.com`.
* If you do not allow the system to manage identity and access management (IAM),
then a cluster administrator can
xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/manually-creating-iam-gcp.adoc#manually-creating-iam-gcp[manually
create and maintain IAM credentials]. Manual mode can also be used in
environments where the cloud IAM APIs are not reachable.

== Configuring your GCP project

Before you can install {product-title}, you must configure a Google Cloud
Platform (GCP) project to host it.
