Before you install {product-title}, decide what kind of installation process to follow and make sure you that you have all of the required resources to prepare the cluster for users.

[id="installing-preparing-selecting-cluster-type"]
== Selecting a cluster installation type
Before you install an {product-title} cluster, you need to select the best installation instructions to follow. Think about your answers to the following questions to select the best option.

[id="installing-preparing-install-manage"]
=== Do you want to install and manage an {product-title} cluster yourself?

If you want to install and manage {product-title} yourself, you can install it on the following platforms:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Microsoft Azure
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* {rh-openstack-first}
* {rh-virtualization-first}
* IBM Z and LinuxONE
* IBM Z and LinuxONE for {op-system-base-full} KVM
* IBM Power
* VMware vSphere
* VMware Cloud (VMC) on AWS
* Bare metal or other platform agnostic infrastructure

You can deploy an {product-title} 4 cluster to both on-premise hardware and to cloud hosting services, but all of the machines in a cluster must be in the same datacenter or cloud hosting service.

If you want to use {product-title} but do not want to manage the cluster yourself, you have several managed service options. If you want a cluster that is fully managed by Red Hat, you can use link:https://www.openshift.com/products/dedicated/[OpenShift Dedicated] or link:https://www.openshift.com/products/online/[OpenShift Online]. You can also use OpenShift as a managed service on Azure, AWS, IBM Cloud, or Google Cloud. For more information about managed services, see the link:https://www.openshift.com/products[OpenShift Products] page.

[id="installing-preparing-migrate"]
=== Have you used {product-title} 3 and want to use {product-title} 4?

If you used {product-title} 3 and want to try {product-title} 4, you need to understand how different {product-title} 4 is. {product-title} 4 weaves the Operators that package, deploy, and manage Kubernetes applications and the operating system that the platform runs on, {op-system-first}, together seamlessly. Instead of deploying machines and configuring their operating systems so that you can install {product-title} on them, the {op-system} operating system is an integral part of the {product-title} cluster. Deploying the operating system for the cluster machines as part of the installation process for {product-title}. See xref:../migrating_from_ocp_3_to_4/planning-migration-3-4.adoc#migration-comparing-ocp-3-4[Comparing OpenShift Container Platform 3 and OpenShift Container Platform 4].

Because you need to provision machines as part of the {product-title} cluster installation process, you cannot upgrade an {product-title} 3 cluster to {product-title} 4. Instead, you must create a new {product-title} 4 cluster and migrate your {product-title} 3 workloads to them. For more information about migrating, see link:https://redhat-cop.github.io/openshift-migration-best-practices/01-planning.html[OpenShift Migration Best Practices]. Because you must migrate to {product-title} 4, you can use any type of production cluster installation process to create your new cluster.

[id="installing-preparing-existing-components"]
=== Do you want to use existing components in your cluster?

Because the operating system is integral to {product-title}, it is easier to let the installation program for {product-title} stand up all of the infrastructure. These are called _installer provisioned infrastructure_ installations. In this type of installation, you can provide some existing infrastructure to the cluster, but the installation program deploys all of the machines that your cluster initially needs.

You can deploy an installer-provisioned infrastructure cluster without specifying any customizations to the cluster or its underlying machines to xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-default.adoc#installing-aws-default[AWS], xref:../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-default.adoc#installing-azure-default[Azure], xref:../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-default.adoc#installing-gcp-default[GCP], or xref:../installing/installing_vmc/installing-vmc.adoc#installing-vmc[VMC on AWS]. These installation methods are the fastest way to deploy a production-capable {product-title} cluster.

If you need to perform basic configuration for your installer-provisioned infrastructure cluster, such as the instance type for the cluster machines, you can customize an installation for xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-customizations.adoc#installing-aws-customizations[AWS], xref:../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-customizations.adoc#installing-azure-customizations[Azure], xref:../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-customizations.adoc#installing-gcp-customizations[GCP], or xref:../installing/installing_vmc/installing-vmc-customizations.adoc#installing-vmc-customizations[VMC on AWS].

For installer-provisioned infrastructure installations, you can use an existing xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-vpc.adoc#installing-aws-vpc[VPC in AWS], xref:../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-vnet.adoc#installing-azure-vnet[vNet in Azure], or xref:../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-vpc.adoc#installing-gcp-vpc[VPC in GCP]. You can also reuse part of your networking infrastructure so that your cluster in xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-network-customizations.adoc#installing-aws-network-customizations[AWS], xref:../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-network-customizations.adoc#installing-azure-network-customizations[Azure], xref:../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-network-customizations.adoc#installing-gcp-network-customizations[GCP], or xref:../installing/installing_vmc/installing-vmc-network-customizations.adoc#installing-vmc-network-customizations[VMC on AWS] can coexist with existing IP address allocations in your environment and integrate with existing MTU and VXLAN configurations. If you have existing accounts and credentials on these clouds, you can re-use them, but you might need to modify the accounts to have the required permissions to install {product-title} clusters on them.

You can use the installer-provisioned infrastructure method to create appropriate machine instances on your hardware for xref:../installing/installing_openstack/installing-openstack-installer-custom.adoc#installing-openstack-installer-custom[{rh-openstack}], xref:../installing/installing_openstack/installing-openstack-installer-kuryr.adoc#installing-openstack-installer-kuryr[{rh-openstack} with Kuryr], xref:../installing/installing_rhv/installing-rhv-default.adoc#installing-rhv-default[{rh-virtualization}], xref:../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned.adoc#installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned[vSphere], and xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-overview#ipi-install-overview[bare metal].

If you want to reuse extensive cloud infrastructure, you can complete a _user-provisioned infrastructure_ installation. With these installations, you manually deploy the machines that your cluster requires during the installation process. If you perform a user-provisioned infrastructure installation on xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-user-infra.adoc#installing-aws-user-infra[AWS], xref:../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-user-infra.adoc#installing-azure-user-infra[Azure], xref:../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-user-infra.adoc#installing-gcp-user-infra[GCP], or xref:../installing/installing_vmc/installing-vmc-user-infra.adoc#installing-vmc-user-infra[VMC on AWS], you can use the provided templates to help you stand up all of the required components. Otherwise, you can use the provider-agnostic installation method to deploy a cluster into other clouds.

You can also complete a user-provisioned infrastructure installation on your existing hardware. If you use xref:../installing/installing_openstack/installing-openstack-user.adoc#installing-openstack-user[{rh-openstack}], xref:../installing/installing_openstack/installing-openstack-user-sr-iov.adoc#installing-openstack-user-sr-iov[{rh-openstack} on SR-IOV], xref:../installing/installing_rhv/installing-rhv-user-infra.adoc#installing-rhv-user-infra[{rh-virtualization}], xref:../installing/installing_ibm_z/installing-ibm-z.adoc#installing-ibm-z[IBM Z or LinuxONE], xref:../installing/installing_ibm_power/installing-ibm-power.adoc#installing-ibm-power[IBM Power], or xref:../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere.adoc#installing-vsphere[vSphere], use the specific installation instructions to deploy your cluster. If you use other supported hardware, follow the xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.adoc#installing-bare-metal[bare metal installation] procedure.

[id="installing-preparing-security"]
=== Do you need extra security for your cluster?

If you use a user-provisioned installation method, you can configure a proxy for your cluster. The instructions are included in each installation procedure.

If you want to prevent your cluster on a public cloud from exposing endpoints externally, you can deploy a private cluster with installer-provisioned infrastructure on xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-private.adoc#installing-aws-private[AWS], xref:../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-private.adoc#installing-azure-private[Azure], or xref:../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-private.adoc#installing-gcp-private[GCP].

If you need to install your cluster that has limited access to the internet, such as a disconnected or restricted network cluster, you can xref:../installing/installing-mirroring-installation-images.adoc#installing-mirroring-installation-images[mirror the installation packages] and install the cluster from them. Follow detailed instructions for user provisioned infrastructure installations into restricted networks for xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-restricted-networks-aws.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-aws[AWS], xref:../installing/installing_gcp/installing-restricted-networks-gcp.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-gcp[GCP], xref:../installing/installing_ibm_z/installing-restricted-networks-ibm-z.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-ibm-z[IBM Z or LinuxONE], xref:../installing/installing_ibm_z/installing-restricted-networks-ibm-z-kvm.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-ibm-z-kvm[IBM Z or LinuxONE with {op-system-base} KVM], xref:../installing/installing_ibm_power/installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power[IBM Power], xref:../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-restricted-networks-vsphere.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-vsphere[vSphere], xref:../installing/installing_vmc/installing-restricted-networks-vmc-user-infra.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-vmc-user-infra[VMC on AWS], or xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-restricted-networks-bare-metal.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-bare-metal[bare metal]. You can also install a cluster into a restricted network using installer-provisioned infrastructure by following detailed instructions for xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-restricted-networks-aws-installer-provisioned.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-aws-installer-provisioned[AWS], xref:../installing/installing_gcp/installing-restricted-networks-gcp-installer-provisioned.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-gcp-installer-provisioned[GCP], xref:../installing/installing_vmc/installing-restricted-networks-vmc.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-vmc[VMC on AWS], xref:../installing/installing_openstack/installing-openstack-installer-restricted.adoc#installing-openstack-installer-restricted[{rh-openstack}], xref:../installing/installing_rhv/installing-rhv-restricted-network.adoc#installing-rhv-restricted-network[{rh-virtualization}], and xref:../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-restricted-networks-installer-provisioned-vsphere.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-installer-provisioned-vsphere[vSphere].

If you need to deploy your cluster to an xref:../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-government-region.adoc#installing-aws-government-region[AWS GovCloud region] or xref:../installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-government-region.adoc#installing-azure-government-region[Azure government region], you can configure those custom regions during an installer-provisioned infrastructure installation.

ifndef::openshift-origin[]
You can also configure the cluster machines to use xref:../installing/installing-fips.adoc#installing-fips[FIPS Validated / Modules in Process cryptographic libraries] during installation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The use of FIPS Validated / Modules in Process cryptographic libraries is only supported on {product-title} deployments on the `x86_64` architecture.
====

endif::[]

[id="installing-preparing-cluster-for-users"]
== Preparing your cluster for users after installation

Some configuration is not required to install the cluster but recommended before your users access the cluster. You can customize the cluster itself by xref:../post_installation_configuration/cluster-tasks.adoc#available_cluster_customizations[customizing] the Operators that make up your cluster and integrate you cluster with other required systems, such as an identity provider.
//This link will change when we consolidate the customizations page with the post-installation activities.

For a production cluster, you must configure the following integrations:

* xref:../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#understanding-persistent-storage[Persistent storage]
* xref:../authentication/understanding-identity-provider.adoc#understanding-identity-provider[An identity provider]
* xref:../monitoring/configuring-the-monitoring-stack.adoc#configuring-the-monitoring-stack[Monitoring core OpenShift Container Platform components]

[id="installing-preparing-cluster-for-workloads"]
== Preparing your cluster for workloads

Depending on your workload needs, you might need to take extra steps before you begin deploying applications. For example, after you prepare infrastructure to support your application xref:../cicd/builds/build-strategies.adoc#build-strategies[build strategy], you might need to make provisions for xref:../scalability_and_performance/cnf-performance-addon-operator-for-low-latency-nodes.adoc#cnf-performance-addon-operator-for-low-latency-nodes[low-latency] workloads or to xref:../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-secrets.adoc#nodes-pods-secrets[protect sensitive workloads]. You can also configure xref:../monitoring/enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects.adoc#enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects[monitoring] for application workloads. If you plan to run xref:../windows_containers/enabling-windows-container-workloads.adoc#enabling-windows-container-workloads[Windows workloads], you must enable xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/configuring-hybrid-networking.adoc#configuring-hybrid-networking[hybrid networking with OVN-Kubernetes] during the installation process; hybrid networking cannot be enabled after your cluster is installed.

[id="supported-installation-methods-for-different-platforms"]
== Supported installation methods for different platforms

You can perform different types of installations on different platforms.

[NOTE]
====
Not all installation options are supported for all platforms, as shown in the following tables.
