= Installing a cluster with {op-system-base} KVM on {ibm-z-title} and {ibm-linuxone-title} in a restricted network
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: installing-restricted-networks-ibm-z-kvm

toc::[]

[role="_abstract"]
In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on
{ibm-z-name} or {ibm-linuxone-name} infrastructure that you provision in a restricted network.

[NOTE]
====
While this document refers to only {ibm-z-name}, all information in it also applies to {ibm-linuxone-name}.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Additional considerations exist for non-bare metal platforms. Review the information in the
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4207611[guidelines for deploying {product-title} on non-tested platforms] before you install an {product-title} cluster.
====

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:../../installing/disconnected_install/installing-mirroring-installation-images.adoc#installing-mirroring-installation-images[created a registry on your mirror host] and obtained the `imageContentSources` data for your version of {product-title}.
* You must move or remove any existing installation files, before you begin the installation process. This ensures that the required installation files are created and updated during the installation process.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that installation steps are done from a machine with access to the installation media.
====
* You provisioned xref:../../storage/persistent_storage/persistent-storage-ocs.adoc#persistent-storage-ocs[persistent storage using {rh-storage}] or other supported storage protocols for your cluster. To deploy a private image registry, you must set up persistent storage with `ReadWriteMany` access.
* If you use a firewall, you xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
+
[NOTE]
====
Be sure to also review this site list if you are configuring a proxy.
====
* You provisioned a {op-system-base} Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) system that is hosted on the logical partition (LPAR) and based on {op-system-base} 8.6 or later. See link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata#RHEL8_and_9_Life_Cycle[Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 Life Cycle].

== Next steps

* xref:../../post_installation_configuration/cluster-tasks.adoc#available_cluster_customizations[Customize your cluster].
* If the mirror registry that you used to install your cluster has a trusted CA, add it to the cluster by xref:../../openshift_images/image-configuration.adoc#images-configuration-cas_image-configuration[configuring additional trust stores].
* If necessary, you can xref:../../support/remote_health_monitoring/opting-out-of-remote-health-reporting.adoc#opting-out-remote-health-reporting_opting-out-remote-health-reporting[opt out of remote health reporting].
