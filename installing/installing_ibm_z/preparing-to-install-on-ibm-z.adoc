== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* Before you begin the installation process, you must clean the installation directory. This ensures that the required installation files are created and updated during the installation process.
* You provisioned xref:../../storage/persistent_storage/persistent-storage-ocs.adoc#persistent-storage-ocs[persistent storage using {rh-storage}] or other supported storage protocols for your cluster. To deploy a private image registry, you must set up persistent storage with `ReadWriteMany` access.
* If you use a firewall, you xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.

[NOTE]
====
While this document refers only to {ibm-z-name}, all information in it also applies to {ibm-linuxone-name}.

== Choosing a method to install {product-title} on {ibm-z-title} or {ibm-linuxone-title}

You can install {product-title} with the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform[{ai-full}]. This method requires no setup for the installer, and is ideal for connected environments like {ibm-z-name}.
See xref:../../installing/installing_on_prem_assisted/installing-on-prem-assisted.adoc#installing-on-prem-assisted[Installing an on-premise cluster using the {ai-full}] for additional details.

You can also install {product-title} on infrastructure that you provide. If you do not use infrastructure that the installation program provisions, you must manage and maintain the cluster resources yourself.

See the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#installation-process_architecture-installation[Installation process] for more information about Assisted Installer and user-provisioned installation processes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The steps for performing a user-provisioned infrastructure installation are provided as an example only. Installing a cluster with infrastructure you provide requires knowledge of the {ibm-z-name} platform and the installation process of {product-title}. Use the user-provisioned infrastructure installation instructions as a guide; you are free to create the required resources through other methods.

=== User-provisioned infrastructure installation of {product-title} on {ibm-z-title}

User-provisioned infrastructure requires the user to provision all resources required by {product-title}.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_z/installing-ibm-z.adoc#installing-ibm-z[Installing a cluster with z/VM on {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name}]**: You can install {product-title} with z/VM on {ibm-z-name} or {ibm-linuxone-name} infrastructure that you provision.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_z/installing-restricted-networks-ibm-z.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-ibm-z[Installing a cluster with z/VM on {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name} in a restricted network]**: You can install {product-title} with z/VM on {ibm-z-name} or {ibm-linuxone-name} infrastructure that you provision in a restricted or disconnected network, by using an internal mirror of the installation release content. You can use this method to install a cluster that does not require an active internet connection to obtain the software components. You can also use this installation method to ensure that your clusters only use container images that satisfy your organizational controls on external content.
