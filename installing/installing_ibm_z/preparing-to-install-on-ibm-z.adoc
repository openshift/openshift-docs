You can install an {product-title} cluster on {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name} using a variety of different installation methods.
Each method has qualities that can make them more suitable for different use cases, such as installing a cluster in a disconnected environment or installing a cluster with minimal configuration and provisioning.

====
While this document refers only to {ibm-z-name}, all information in it also applies to {ibm-linuxone-name}.

== Choosing a method to install {product-title} on {ibm-z-title} or {ibm-linuxone-title}

The {product-title} installation program offers the following methods for deploying a cluster on {ibm-z-name}:

* *Interactive*: You can deploy a cluster with the web-based link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform[{ai-full}]. This method requires no setup for the installer, and is ideal for connected environments like {ibm-z-name}.

* *Local Agent-based*: You can deploy a cluster locally with the xref:../../installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer.adoc#preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer[Agent-based Installer]. It provides many of the benefits of the {ai-full}, but you must download and configure the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/ibmz/agent-based[Agent-based Installer] first. Configuration is done with a command line interface (CLI). This approach is ideal for disconnected networks.

* *Full control*: You can deploy a cluster on infrastructure that you prepare and maintain, which provides maximum customizability. You can deploy clusters in connected or disconnected environments.

== User-provisioned infrastructure installation of {product-title} on {ibm-z-title}

User-provisioned infrastructure requires the user to provision all resources required by {product-title}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The steps for performing a user-provisioned infrastructure installation are provided as an example only. Installing a cluster with infrastructure you provide requires knowledge of the {ibm-z-name} platform and the installation process of {product-title}. Use the user-provisioned infrastructure installation instructions as a guide; you are free to create the required resources through other methods.
