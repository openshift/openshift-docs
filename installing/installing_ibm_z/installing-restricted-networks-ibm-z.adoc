= Installing a cluster with z/VM on IBM Z and LinuxONE in a restricted network

toc::[]

[role="_abstract"]
In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on
IBM Z and LinuxONE infrastructure that you provision in a restricted network.

[NOTE]
====
While this document refers to only IBM Z, all information in it also applies to LinuxONE.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Additional considerations exist for non-bare metal platforms. Review the information in the
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4207611[guidelines for deploying {product-title} on non-tested platforms] before you install an {product-title} cluster.
====

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:../../installing/disconnected_install/installing-mirroring-installation-images.adoc#installing-mirroring-installation-images[created a mirror registry for installation in a restricted network] and obtained the `imageContentSources` data for your version of {product-title}.
* Before you begin the installation process, you must move or remove any existing installation files. This ensures that the required installation files are created and updated during the installation process.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that installation steps are done from a machine with access to the installation media.
====
* You provisioned xref:../../storage/persistent_storage/persistent-storage-ocs.adoc#persistent-storage-ocs[persistent storage using {rh-storage}] or other supported storage protocols for your cluster. To deploy a private image registry, you must set up persistent storage with `ReadWriteMany` access.
* If you use a firewall and plan to use the Telemetry service, you xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured the firewall to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
+
[NOTE]
====
Be sure to also review this site list if you are configuring a proxy.

== Requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure

For a cluster that contains user-provisioned infrastructure, you must deploy all
of the required machines.
