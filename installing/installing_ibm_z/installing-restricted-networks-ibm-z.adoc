toc::[]

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on
IBM Z and LinuxONE infrastructure that you provision in a restricted network.

[NOTE]
====
While this document refers only to IBM Z, all information in it also applies to LinuxONE.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Additional considerations exist for non-bare metal platforms. Review the information in the
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4207611[guidelines for deploying {product-title} on non-tested platforms] before you install an {product-title} cluster.
====

== Prerequisites

* xref:../../installing/install_config/installing-restricted-networks-preparations.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-preparations[Create a mirror registry on your bastion host] and obtain the `imageContentSources` data for your version of {product-title}.
* Before you begin the disconnected installation process, you must move or remove the existing `/usr/local/bin/openshift-install` bastion file. This ensures that the updated `/usr/local/bin/openshift-install` file is created during the disconnected installation process.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the installation media is on the bastion host, use that computer
to complete all installation steps.
====
* Provision
xref:../../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage]
using NFS for your cluster. To deploy a private image registry, your storage
must provide ReadWriteMany access modes.
* Review details about the
xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update]
processes.
* If you use a firewall and plan to use telemetry, you must
xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configure the firewall to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.

[NOTE]
====
Be sure to also review this site list if you are configuring a proxy.
