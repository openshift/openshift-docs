toc::[]

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on
IBM Z or LinuxONE infrastructure that you provision.

[NOTE]
====
While this document refers only to IBM Z, all information in it also applies to LinuxONE.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Additional considerations exist for non-bare metal platforms. Review the information in the
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4207611[guidelines for deploying {product-title} on non-tested platforms] before you install an {product-title} cluster.
====

== Prerequisites

* Before you begin the installation process, you must clean the installation directory. This ensures that the required installation files are created and updated during the installation process.

* Provision
xref:../../storage/persistent_storage/persistent-storage-nfs.adoc#persistent-storage-nfs[persistent storage using NFS]
for your cluster. To deploy a private image registry, your storage must provide
ReadWriteMany access modes.
* Review details about the
xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update]
processes.
* If you use a firewall, you must
xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configure it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
* {op-system-base} Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) system that is hosted on the logical partition (LPAR) and based on {op-system-base} 8.3 or higher
