== Choosing a method to install {product-title} with {op-system-base} KVM on IBM Z or LinuxONE

You can install a cluster with {op-system-base} KVM on IBM Z or LinuxONE infrastructure that you provision, by using one of the following methods:

* **xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_z/installing-ibm-z-kvm.adoc#installing-ibm-z-kvm[Installing a cluster with RHEL KVM on IBM Z and LinuxONE]**: You can install {product-title} with KVM on IBM Z or LinuxONE infrastructure that you provision.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_z/installing-restricted-networks-ibm-z-kvm.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-ibm-z-kvm[Installing a cluster with {op-system-base} KVM on IBM Z and LinuxONE in a restricted network]**: You can install {product-title} with {op-system-base} KVM on IBM Z or LinuxONE infrastructure that you provision in a restricted or disconnected network, by using an internal mirror of the installation release content. You can use this method to install a cluster that does not require an active internet connection to obtain the software components. You can also use this installation method to ensure that your clusters only use container images that satisfy your organizational controls on external content.
