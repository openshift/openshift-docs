{product-title-short} uses a special artifact during installation that allows Central to communicate securely with the secured clusters that you are adding. Before the 4.7 release, {product-title-short} used _init bundles_ exclusively for initiating the secure communication channel. Beginning with 4.7, {product-title-short} provides an alternative to init bundles called _cluster registration secrets_ (CRSes).

:FeatureName: Cluster registration secrets

Currently, using an init bundle or a cluster registration secret (CRS) during installation is supported. However, {product-title-short} does not yet provide a way to create a CRS by using the portal. Therefore, you must create the CRS by using the `roxctl` CLI.

You can use CRSes when you are installing {product-title-short} by using the Operator or Helm installation methods.

Before you set up a secured cluster, you must create an init bundle or CRS. The secured cluster then uses this bundle or CRS to authenticate with Central. You can create an init bundle by using either the {product-title-short} portal or the `roxctl` CLI. If you are using a CRS, you must use the `roxctl` CLI to create it.

You can then apply the init bundle or the CRS by using the {ocp} web console or by using the `oc` or `kubectl` CLI. If you install {product-title-short} by using Helm, you provide the init bundle or CRS when you run the `helm install` command.

[NOTE]
====
You must have the `Admin` user role to create an init bundle.
