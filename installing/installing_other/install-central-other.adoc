Central is the resource that contains the {product-title-short} application management interface and services. It handles data persistence, API interactions, and {product-title-short} portal access. You can use the same Central instance to secure multiple {ocp} or Kubernetes clusters.

You can install Central by using one of the following methods:

* Install using Helm charts
* Install using the `roxctl` CLI (do not use this method unless you have a specific installation need that requires using it)

// Install using Helm

== Install Central using Helm charts

You can install Central using Helm charts without any customization, using the default values, or by using Helm charts with additional customizations of configuration parameters.

=== Install Central using Helm charts without customization

You can install {product-title-short} on your {osp} cluster without any customizations. You must add the Helm chart repository and install the `central-services` Helm chart to install the centralized components of Central and Scanner.

=== Install Central using Helm charts with customizations

You can install {product-title-short} on your {osp} cluster with customizations by using Helm chart configuration parameters with the `helm install` and `helm upgrade` commands. You can specify these parameters by using the `--set` option or by creating YAML configuration files.

Create the following files for configuring the Helm chart for installing {product-title}:

* Public configuration file `values-public.yaml`: Use this file to save all non-sensitive configuration options.
* Private configuration file `values-private.yaml`: Use this file to save all sensitive configuration options. Ensure that you store this file securely.
