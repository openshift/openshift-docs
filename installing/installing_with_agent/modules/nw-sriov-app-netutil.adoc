= DPDK library for use with container applications

An link:https://github.com/openshift/app-netutil[optional library], `app-netutil`, provides several API methods for gathering network information about a pod from within a container running within that pod.

This library can assist with integrating SR-IOV virtual functions (VFs) in Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) mode into the container.
The library provides both a Golang API and a C API.

Currently there are three API methods implemented:

`GetCPUInfo()`:: This function determines which CPUs are available to the container and returns the list.

`GetHugepages()`:: This function determines the amount of huge page memory requested in the `Pod` spec for each container and returns the values.

`GetInterfaces()`:: This function determines the set of interfaces in the container and returns the list. The return value includes the interface type and type-specific data for each interface.

The repository for the library includes a sample Dockerfile to build a container image, `dpdk-app-centos`. The container image can run one of the following DPDK sample applications, depending on an environment variable in the pod specification: `l2fwd`, `l3wd` or `testpmd`. The container image provides an example of integrating the `app-netutil` library into the container image itself. The library can also integrate into an init container. The init container can collect the required data and pass the data to an existing DPDK workload.
