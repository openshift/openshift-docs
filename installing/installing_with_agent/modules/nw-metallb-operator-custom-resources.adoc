= MetalLB Operator custom resources

The MetalLB Operator monitors its own namespace for the following custom resources:

`MetalLB`::
When you add a `MetalLB` custom resource to the cluster, the MetalLB Operator deploys MetalLB on the cluster.
The Operator only supports a single instance of the custom resource.
If the instance is deleted, the Operator removes MetalLB from the cluster.

`AddressPool`::
MetalLB requires one or more pools of IP addresses that it can assign to a service when you add a service of type `LoadBalancer`.
When you add an `AddressPool` custom resource to the cluster, the MetalLB Operator configures MetalLB so that it can assign IP addresses from the pool.
An address pool includes a list of IP addresses.
The list can be a single IP address that is set using a range, such as 1.1.1.1-1.1.1.1, a range specified in CIDR notation, a range specified as a starting and ending address separated by a hyphen, or a combination of the three.
An address pool requires a name.
The documentation uses names like `doc-example`, `doc-example-reserved`, and `doc-example-ipv6`.
An address pool specifies whether MetalLB can automatically assign IP addresses from the pool or whether the IP addresses are reserved for services that explicitly specify the pool by name.
An address pool specifies whether MetalLB uses layer 2 protocols to advertise the IP addresses, or whether the BGP protocol is used.

`BGPPeer`::
The BGP peer custom resource identifies the BGP router for MetalLB to communicate with, the AS number of the router, the AS number for MetalLB, and customizations for route advertisement.
MetalLB advertises the routes for service load-balancer IP addresses to one or more BGP peers.
The service load-balancer IP addresses are specified with `AddressPool` custom resources that set the `protocol` field to `bgp`.

`BFDProfile`::
The BFD profile custom resource configures Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for a BGP peer.
BFD provides faster path failure detection than BGP alone provides.

After you add the `MetalLB` custom resource to the cluster and the Operator deploys MetalLB, the MetalLB software components, `controller` and `speaker`, begin running.

The Operator includes validating webhooks for the `AddressPool` and `BGPPeer` custom resources.
The webhook for the address pool custom resource performs the following checks: that the address pool name is unique.

* Address pool names must be unique.
* IP address ranges do not overlap with an existing address pool.
* If the address pool includes a `bgpAdvertisement` field, the `protocol` field must be set to `bgp`.

The webhook for the BGP peer custom resource performs the following checks:

* If the BGP peer name matches an existing peer, the IP address for the peer must be unique.
* If the `keepaliveTime` field is specified, the `holdTime` field must be specified and the keep-alive duration must be less than the hold time.
* The `myASN` field must be the same for all BGP peers.
