= Creating alert routing for user-defined projects
 
[IMPORTANT]
====
[subs="attributes+"]
Alert routing for user-defined projects is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview].

[role="_abstract"]
If you are a non-administrator user who has been given the `alert-routing-edit` role, you can create or edit alert routing for user-defined projects. 

.Prerequisites

* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* A cluster administrator has enabled alert routing for user-defined projects.
* You are logged in as a user that has the `alert-routing-edit` role for the project for which you want to create alert routing.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file for alert routing. The example in this procedure uses a file called `example-app-alert-routing.yaml`.

. Add an `AlertmanagerConfig` YAML definition to the file. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: AlertmanagerConfig
metadata:
  name: example-routing
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  route:
    receiver: default
    groupBy: [job]
  receivers:
  - name: default
    webhookConfigs:
    - url: https://example.org/post
----
+
[NOTE]
====
For user-defined alerting rules, user-defined routing is scoped to the namespace in which the resource is defined.
For example, a routing configuration defined in the `AlertmanagerConfig` object for namespace `ns1` only applies to `PrometheusRules` resources in the same namespace.
====
+
. Save the file.

. Apply the resource to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f example-app-alert-routing.yaml
----
+
The configuration is automatically applied to the Alertmanager pods.
