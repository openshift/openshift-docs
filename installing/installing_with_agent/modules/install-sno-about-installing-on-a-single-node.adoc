= About OpenShift on a single node

You can create a single node cluster with standard installation methods. {product-title} on a single node is a specialized installation that requires the creation of a special ignition configuration ISO. The primary use case is for edge computing workloads, including intermittent connectivity, portable clouds, and 5G radio access networks (RAN) close to a base station. The major tradeoff with an installation on a single node is the lack of high availability.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The use of OpenShiftSDN with single-node OpenShift is deprecated. OVN-Kubernetes is the default networking solution for single-node OpenShift deployments.
