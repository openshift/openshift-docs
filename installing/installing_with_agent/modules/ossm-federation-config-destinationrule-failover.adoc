= Configuring a DestinationRule for failover

Create a `DestinationRule` resource that configures the following:

* Outlier detection for the service. This is required in order for failover to function properly. In particular, it configures the sidecar proxies to know when endpoints for a service are unhealthy, eventually triggering a failover to the next locality.

* Failover policy between regions. This ensures that failover beyond a region boundary will behave predictably.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} CLI as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. Enter the following command. Then, enter your username and password when prompted.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login --username=<NAMEOFUSER> <API token> https://<HOSTNAME>:6443
----
+
. Change to the project where you installed the control plane.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project <smcp-system>
----
+
For example, `green-mesh-system`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project green-mesh-system
----
+
. Create a `DestinationRule` file based on the following example where if green-mesh is unavailable, the traffic should be routed from the green-mesh in the `us-east` region to the red-mesh in `us-west`.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -n green-mesh-system -f green-mesh-usWestDestinationRule.yaml
