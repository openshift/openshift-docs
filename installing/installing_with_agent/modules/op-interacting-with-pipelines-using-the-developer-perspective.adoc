* The namespace in which the pipeline was created
* The last pipeline run
* The status of the tasks in the pipeline run
* The status of the pipeline run

* Click the required pipeline run to see the *Pipeline Run details* page. By default, the *Details* tab displays a visual representation of all the serial tasks, parallel tasks, `finally` tasks, and when expressions in the pipeline run. The results for successful runs are displayed under the *Pipeline Run results* pane at the bottom of the page.
