[id="builds-restricting-build-strategy-to-user_{context}"]
= Restricting build strategies to a user within a project

Similar to granting the build strategy role to a user globally, you can allow a set of specific users within a project to create builds with a particular strategy.

.Prerequisites

* Disable global access to the build strategy.

.Procedure

* Assign the role that corresponds to the build strategy to a specific user within a project. For example, to add the `system:build-strategy-docker` role within the project `devproject` to the user `devuser`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user system:build-strategy-docker devuser -n devproject
