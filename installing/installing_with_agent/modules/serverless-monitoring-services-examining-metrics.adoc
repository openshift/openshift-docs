= Examining metrics of a service

After you have configured the application to export the metrics and the monitoring stack to scrape them, you can examine the metrics in the web console.

.Prerequisites

* You have logged in to the {product-title} web console.
* You have installed the {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving.

.Procedure

. Optional: Run requests against your application that you will be able to see in the metrics:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ hello_route=$(oc get ksvc helloworld-go -n ns1 -o jsonpath='{.status.url}') && \
    curl $hello_route
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Hello Go Sample v1!
----

. In the web console, navigate to the *Observe* -> *Metrics* interface.

. In the input field, enter the query for the metric you want to observe, for example:
+
[source]
----
revision_app_request_count{namespace="ns1", job="helloworld-go-sm"}
----
+
Another example:
+
[source]
----
myapp_processed_ops_total{namespace="ns1", job="helloworld-go-sm"}
----

. Observe the visualized metrics:
