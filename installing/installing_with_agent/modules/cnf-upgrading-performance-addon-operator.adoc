[id="upgrading-performance-addon-operator-configured-for-a-specific-namespace_{context}"]
=== Upgrading Performance Addon Operator when previously installed to a specific namespace

If you previously installed the Performance Addon Operator to a specific namespace on the cluster, for example `openshift-performance-addon-operator`, modify the `OperatorGroup` object to remove the `targetNamespaces` entry before upgrading.

.Prerequisites

* Install the {product-title} CLI (oc).
* Log in to the OpenShift cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

.Procedure

. Edit the Performance Addon Operator `OperatorGroup` CR and remove the `spec` element that contains the `targetNamespaces` entry by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch operatorgroup -n openshift-performance-addon-operator openshift-performance-addon-operator --type json -p '[{ "op": "remove", "path": "/spec" }]'
----

. Wait until the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) processes the change.
. Verify that the OperatorGroup CR change has been successfully applied. Check that the `OperatorGroup` CR `spec` element has been removed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe -n openshift-performance-addon-operator og openshift-performance-addon-operator
----

. Proceed with the Performance Addon Operator upgrade.
//. Proceed with the xref:../scalability_and_performance/cnf-performance-addon-operator-for-low-latency-nodes#upgrading-performance-addon-operator_{context}[Performance Addon Operator upgrade].

[id="performance-addon-operator-monitoring-upgrade-status_{context}"]
== Monitoring upgrade status
The best way to monitor Performance Addon Operator upgrade status is to watch the `ClusterServiceVersion` (CSV) `PHASE`.
You can also monitor the CSV conditions in the web console or by running the `oc get csv` command.

[NOTE]
====
The `PHASE` and conditions values are approximations that are based on available information.
====

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csv
----

. Review the output, checking the `PHASE` field. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
VERSION    REPLACES                                         PHASE

4.8.0                                                       Replacing
----

. Run `get csv` again to verify the output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# oc get csv
