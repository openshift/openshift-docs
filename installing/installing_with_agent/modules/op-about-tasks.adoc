= Tasks

_Tasks_ are the building blocks of a pipeline and consists of sequentially executed steps. It is essentially a function of inputs and outputs. A task can run individually or as a part of the pipeline. Tasks are reusable and can be used in multiple Pipelines.

_Steps_ are a series of commands that are sequentially executed by the task and achieve a specific goal, such as building an image. Every task runs as a pod, and each step runs as a container within that pod. Because steps run within the same pod, they can access the same volumes for caching files, config maps, and secrets.

The following example shows the `apply-manifests` task.

----
<1> The task API version, `v1beta1`.
<2> The type of Kubernetes object, `Task`.
<3> The unique name of this task.
<4> The list of parameters and steps in the task and the workspace used by the task.

This task starts the pod and runs a container inside that pod using the specified image to run the specified commands.

[NOTE]
====
Starting with {pipelines-shortname} 1.6, the following defaults from the step YAML file are removed:

* The `HOME` environment variable does not default to the `/tekton/home` directory
* The `workingDir` field does not default to the `/workspace` directory

Instead, the container for the step defines the `HOME` environment variable and the `workingDir` field. However, you can override the default values by specifying the custom values in the YAML file for the step.

As a temporary measure, to maintain backward compatibility with the older {pipelines-shortname} versions, you can set the following fields in the `TektonConfig` custom resource definition to `false`:
```
spec:
  pipeline:
    disable-working-directory-overwrite: false
    disable-home-env-overwrite: false
```
