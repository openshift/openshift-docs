= Scaling the application

In Kubernetes, a `Deployment` object defines how an application deploys. In most cases, users use `Pod`, `Service`, `ReplicaSets`, and `Deployment` resources together. In most cases, {product-title} creates the resources for you.

When you deploy the `national-parks-app` image, a deployment resource is created.  In this example, only one `Pod` is deployed.

The following procedure scales the `national-parks-image` to use two instances.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console.
* You are in the *Developer* perspective.
* You have a deployed image.

.Procedure

. In the *Topology* view, click the `national-parks-app` application.
. Click the *Details* tab.
. Use the up arrow to scale the pod to two instances.

[NOTE]
====
Application scaling can happen quickly because {product-title} is launching a new instance of an existing image.
====

. Use the down arrow to scale the pod down to one instance.
