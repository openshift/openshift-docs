= Creating more {op-system} machines using an ISO image

You can create more {op-system-first} compute machines for your bare metal cluster by using an ISO image to create the machines.

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the URL of the Ignition config file for the compute machines for your cluster. You uploaded this file to your HTTP server during installation.

.Procedure

. Use the ISO file to install {op-system} on more compute machines. Use the same method that you used when you created machines before you installed the cluster:
** Burn the ISO image to a disk and boot it directly.
** Use ISO redirection with a LOM interface.

. After the instance boots, press the `TAB` or `E` key to edit the kernel command line.
. Add the parameters to the kernel command line:
+
[source,terminal]
----
coreos.inst.install_dev=sda <1>
coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://example.com/worker.ign <2>
----
<1> Specify the block device of the system to install to.
<2> Specify the URL of the compute Ignition config file. Only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported.

. Press `Enter` to complete the installation. After {op-system} installs, the system reboots. After the system reboots, it applies the Ignition config file that you specified.

. Continue to create more compute machines for your cluster.
