= Installing {sandboxed-containers-first} on selected nodes using the web console

You can use labels to install `kata` as a `RuntimeClass` on specific worker nodes.

By default, when you create the `KataConfig` custom resource (CR), the {sandboxed-containers-operator} installs `kata` as a `RuntimeClass` on all worker nodes. Add labels to specific worker nodes and define the label in the `KataConfig` CR when you create it to install Kata only on the labeled nodes.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed {product-title} {product-version} on your cluster.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the {sandboxed-containers-operator}.

.Procedure

. Label the nodes:

.. From the *Administrator* perspective in the web console, navigate to *Compute* → *Nodes*.

.. Select the node you want to label.

.. In the *Node details* page, click *Actions* and select *Edit labels*.

.. In the *Edit labels* window, enter the new label using this format: `<label_key>=<label_value>`.

.. Click *Save*.

.. Repeat for each node you want to label.

. Create the `KataConfig` CR:

.. Navigate to *Operators* → *Installed Operators*.

.. Select the {sandboxed-containers-operator} from the list of operators.

.. In the *KataConfig* tab, click *Create KataConfig*.

.. In the *Create KataConfig* page, select to configure the `KataConfig` CR via *YAML view*.

.. Copy and paste the following manifest in the *YAML view*:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kataconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: KataConfig
metadata:
  name: cluster-kataconfig
spec:
  kataConfigPoolSelector:
    matchLabels:
    <label_key>: '<label_value>'
----

.. Click *Create*.

The new `KataConfig` CR is created and begins to install `kata` as a `RuntimeClass` on the labeled nodes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{sandboxed-containers-first} installs Kata only as a secondary, optional runtime on the cluster and not as the primary runtime.
====

.Verification

. In the *KataConfig* tab, select the new KataConfig CR.

. In the *KataConfig* page, select the *YAML* tab.

.  Monitor the *installationStatus* field in the status.
+
If the value of *Completed nodes* equals the number of labeled nodes, then the installation is completed. The status also contains a list of nodes where the installation is completed.
// TROUBLESHOOTING??
//* You can check to see if the nodes in the `machine-config-pool` object are going through a config update.
//** If you are using the default nodes, you can monitor the `machine-config-pool` resource by running:
//+
//[source,terminal]
//----
//$ watch oc get mcp worker
//----
//** If you are using selected nodes, you can monitor the `machine-config-pool` resource by running:
//+
//[source,terminal]
//----
//$ watch oc get mcp kata-oc
//----
//
//* You can run `watch oc describe kataconfig cluster-kataconfig` to display information about `sandboxed-containers` extension failure on a node. The information is gathered from the status of the `machine-config-pool` object. You can view the information by running:
//+
//[source,terminal]
//----
//$ oc describe mcp <machine-config-pool>
//----
