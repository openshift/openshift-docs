= Broker types

There are multiple broker implementations available for use with {ServerlessProductName}, each of which have different event delivery guarantees and use different underlying technologies. You can choose the broker implementation when creating a broker by specifying a broker class, otherwise the default broker class is used. The default broker class can be configured by cluster administrators.
// TO DO: Need to add docs about setting default broker class.

[id="serverless-using-brokers-channel-based"]
== Channel-based broker

The channel-based broker implementation internally uses channels for event delivery. Channel-based brokers provide different event delivery guarantees based on the channel implementation a broker instance uses, for example:

* A broker using the `InMemoryChannel` implementation is useful for development and testing purposes, but does not provide adequate event delivery guarantees for production environments.

* A broker using the `KafkaChannel` implementation provides the event delivery guarantees required for a production environment.

[id="serverless-using-brokers-kafka"]
== Kafka broker

:FeatureName: Kafka broker
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

The Kafka broker is a broker implementation that uses Kafka internally to provide at-least once delivery guarantees. It supports multiple Kafka versions, and has a native integration with Kafka for storing and routing events.
