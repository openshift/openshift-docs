= Setting the Kourier Gateway service type
// should probably be a procedure but this is out of scope for the abstracts PR

The Kourier Gateway is exposed by default as the `ClusterIP` service type. This service type is determined by the `service-type` ingress spec in the `KnativeServing` custom resource (CR).

.Default spec
[source,yaml]

...
spec:
  ingress:
    kourier:
      service-type: ClusterIP

You can override the default service type to use a load balancer service type instead by modifying the `service-type` spec:

.LoadBalancer override spec
[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
  ingress:
    kourier:
      service-type: LoadBalancer
...
