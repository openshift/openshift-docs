= Deploying an application from the Developer Catalog

From the {product-title} web console, you can deploy a test application from the Developer Catalog and expose it with a route.

.Prerequisites

* You created an {product-title} cluster.
* You configured an identity provider for your cluster.
* You added your user account to the configured identity provider.

.Procedure

. From {cluster-manager}, click *Open console*.

. In the *Administrator* perspective, select *Home* -> *Projects* -> *Create Project*.

. Enter a name for your project and optionally add a *Display Name* and *Description*.

. Click *Create* to create the project.

. Switch to the *Developer* perspective and select *+Add*. Make sure that the selected *Project* is the one that you just created.
