= Example address pool configurations

== Example: IPv4 and CIDR ranges

You can specify a range of IP addresses in CIDR notation.
You can combine CIDR notation with the notation that uses a hyphen to separate lower and upper bounds.

  - 192.168.255.1-192.168.255.5
----

== Example: Reserve IP addresses

You can set the `autoAssign` field to `false` to prevent MetalLB from automatically assigning the IP addresses from the pool.
When you add a service, you can request a specific IP address from the pool or you can specify the pool name in an annotation to request any IP address from the pool.

== Example: IPv4 and IPv6 addresses

You can add address pools that use IPv4 and IPv6.
You can specify multiple ranges in the `addresses` list, just like several IPv4 examples.

Whether the service is assigned a single IPv4 address, a single IPv6 address, or both is determined by how you add the service.
The `spec.ipFamilies` and `spec.ipFamilyPolicy` fields control how IP addresses are assigned to the service.

== Example: Simple address pool with BGP mode

For BGP mode, you must set the `protocol` field set to `bgp`.
Other address pool custom resource fields, such as `autoAssign`, also apply to BGP mode.

In the following example, the peer BGP routers receive one `203.0.113.200/32` route and one `fc00:f853:ccd:e799::1/128` route for each load-balancer IP address that MetalLB assigns to a service.
Because the `localPref` and `communities` fields are not specified, the routes are advertised with `localPref` set to zero and no BGP communities.

== Example: BGP mode with custom advertisement

You can specify sophisticated custom advertisements.

    - fc00:f853:ccd:e799::/124

    - 65535:65282

    localPref: 100
  - communities:
    - 8000:800
    aggregationLength: 30
    aggregationLengthV6: 124
----

In the preceding example, MetalLB assigns IP addresses to load-balancer services in the ranges between `203.0.113.200` and `203.0.113.203` and between `fc00:f853:ccd:e799::0` and `fc00:f853:ccd:e799::f`.

To explain the two BGP advertisements, consider an instance when MetalLB assigns the IP address of `203.0.113.200` to a service.
With that IP address as an example, the speaker advertises two routes to BGP peers:

* `203.0.113.200/32`, with `localPref` set to `100` and the community set to the numeric value of the well-known `NO_ADVERTISE` community.
This specification indicates to the peer routers that they can use this route but they should not propagate information about this route to BGP peers.

* `203.0.113.200/30`, aggregates the load-balancer IP addresses assigned by MetalLB into a single route.
MetalLB advertises the aggregated route to BGP peers with the community attribute set to `8000:800`.
BGP peers propagate the `203.0.113.200/30` route to other BGP peers.
When traffic is routed to a node with a speaker, the `203.0.113.200/32` route is used to forward the traffic into the cluster and to a pod that is associated with the service.

As you add more services and MetalLB assigns more load-balancer IP addresses from the pool, peer routers receive one local route, `203.0.113.20x/32`, for each service, as well as the `203.0.113.200/30` aggregate route.
Each service that you add generates the `/30` route, but MetalLB deduplicates the routes to one BGP advertisement before communicating with peer routers.
