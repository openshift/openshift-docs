= How the network interface is selected

For installations on bare metal or with virtual machines that have more than one network interface controller (NIC), the NIC that {product-title} uses for communication with the Kubernetes API server is determined by the `nodeip-configuration.service` service unit that is run by systemd when the node boots.
The service iterates through the network interfaces on the node and the first network interface that is configured with a subnet than can host the IP address for the API server is selected for {product-title} communication.

After the `nodeip-configuration.service` service determines the correct NIC, the service creates the `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/20-nodenet.conf` file.
The `20-nodenet.conf` file sets the `KUBELET_NODE_IP` environment variable to the IP address that the service selected.

When the kubelet service starts, it reads the value of the environment variable from the `20-nodenet.conf` file and sets the IP address as the value to the `--node-ip` kubelet command-line argument.
As a result, the kubelet service uses the selected IP address as the node IP address.

If hardware or networking is reconfigured after installation, it is possible that the `nodeip-configuration.service` service can select a different NIC after a reboot.
In some cases, you might be able to detect that a different NIC is selected by reviewing the `INTERNAL-IP` column in the output from the `oc get nodes -o wide` command.

If network communication is disrupted or misconfigured because a different NIC is selected, one strategy for overriding the selection process is to set the correct IP address explicitly.
The following list identifies the high-level steps and considerations:

* Create a shell script that determines the IP address to use for {product-title} communication. Have the script create a custom unit file such as `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/98-nodenet-override.conf`. Use the custom unit file, `98-nodenet-override.conf`, to set the `KUBELET_NODE_IP` environment variable to the IP address.

* Do not overwrite the `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/20-nodenet.conf` file. Specify a file name with a numerically higher value such as `98-nodenet-override.conf` in the same directory path. The goal is to have the custom unit file run after `20-nodenet.conf` and override the value of the environment variable.

* Create a machine config object with the shell script as a base64-encoded string and use the Machine Config Operator to deploy the script to the nodes at a file system path such as `/usr/local/bin/override-node-ip.sh`.

* Ensure that `systemctl daemon-reload` runs after the shell script runs. The simplest method is to specify `ExecStart=systemctl daemon-reload` in the machine config, as shown in the following sample.
