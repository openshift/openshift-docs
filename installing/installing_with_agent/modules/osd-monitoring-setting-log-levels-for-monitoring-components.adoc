= Setting log levels for monitoring components

You can configure the log level for Prometheus Operator, Prometheus, and Thanos Ruler.

The following log levels can be applied to each of those components in the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object:

* `debug`. Log debug, informational, warning, and error messages.
* `info`. Log informational, warning, and error messages.
* `warn`. Log warning and error messages only.
* `error`. Log error messages only.

The default log level is `info`.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.
* You have created the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Edit the `ConfigMap` object:
.. Edit the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
----

.. Add `logLevel: <log_level>` for a component under `data.config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>: <1>
      logLevel: <log_level> <2>
----
<1> The monitoring component that you are applying a log level to.
<2> The log level to apply to the component.

. Save the file to apply the changes. The pods for the component restarts automatically when you apply the log-level change.
+
[WARNING]
====
When changes are saved to a monitoring config map, the pods and other resources in the related project might be redeployed. The running monitoring processes in that project might also be restarted.
====

. Confirm that the log level has been applied by reviewing the deployment or pod configuration in the related project. The following example checks the log level in the `prometheus-operator` deployment in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring get deploy prometheus-operator -o yaml |  grep "log-level"
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
        - --log-level=debug
----

. Check that the pods for the component are running. The following example lists the status of pods in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring get pods
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If an unrecognized `loglevel` value is included in the `ConfigMap` object, the pods for the component might not restart successfully.
