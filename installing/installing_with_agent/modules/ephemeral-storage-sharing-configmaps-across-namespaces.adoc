= Sharing a config map across namespaces

[role="_abstract"]
To share a config map across namespaces in a cluster, you create a `SharedConfigMap` custom resource (CR) instance for that config map.

.Prerequisites

You must have permission to perform the following actions:

* Create instances of the `sharedconfigmaps.sharedresource.openshift.io` custom resource definition (CRD) at a cluster-scoped level.
* Manage roles and role bindings across the namespaces in the cluster to control which users can get, list, and watch those instances.
* Manage roles and role bindings across the namespaces in the cluster to control which service accounts in pods that mount your Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume can use those instances.
* Access the namespaces that contain the Secrets you want to share.

.Procedure

. Create a `SharedConfigMap` CR instance for the config map that you want to share across namespaces in the cluster:
