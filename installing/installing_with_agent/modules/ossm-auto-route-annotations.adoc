= {SMProductName} route annotations

Sometimes specific annotations are needed in an OpenShift Route. For example, some advanced features in OpenShift Routes are managed via xref:../../networking/routes/route-configuration.adoc[special annotations]. For this and other use cases, {SMProductName} will copy all annotations present in the Istio Gateway resource (with the exception of those starting with `kubectl.kubernetes.io`) into the managed OpenShift Route resource.

If you need specific annotations in the OpenShift Routes created by {SMProductShortName}, create them in the Istio Gateway resource and they will be copied into the OpenShift Route resources managed by the {SMProductShortName}.
