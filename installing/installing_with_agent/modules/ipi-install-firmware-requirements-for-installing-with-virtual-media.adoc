= Firmware requirements for installing with virtual media

The installer for installer-provisioned {product-title} clusters validates the hardware and firmware compatibility with Redfish virtual media. The following table lists supported firmware for installer-provisioned {product-title} clusters deployed with Redfish virtual media.

.Firmware compatibility for Redfish virtual media
[frame="topbot", options="header"]
|====
|Hardware| Model | Management | Firmware Versions
.2+| HP | 10th Generation | iLO5 | N/A
| 9th Generation | iLO4 | N/A

.2+| Dell | 14th Generation | iDRAC 9 | v4.20.20.20 - 04.40.00.00

| 13th Generation .2+| iDRAC 8 | v2.75.75.75+

|====

[NOTE]
====
See the hardware documentation for the nodes or contact the hardware vendor for information on updating the firmware.

There are no known firmware limitations for HP servers.

For Dell servers, ensure the {product-title} cluster nodes have AutoAttach Enabled through the iDRAC console. The menu path is: *Configuration* -> *Virtual Media* -> *Attach Mode* -> *AutoAttach* . With iDRAC 9 firmware version `04.40.00.00`, the Virtual Console plug-in defaults to `eHTML5`, which causes problems with the *InsertVirtualMedia* workflow. Set the plug-in to `HTML5` to avoid this issue. The menu path is: *Configuration* -> *Virtual console* -> *Plug-in Type* -> *HTML5* .

[IMPORTANT]
====
The installer will not initiate installation on a node if the node firmware is below the foregoing versions when installing with virtual media.
