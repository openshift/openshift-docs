= Deleting the AWS resources by using the AWS IAM Console

After deleting a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster, you can delete the AWS Security Token Service (STS) resources by using the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Console.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Account-wide IAM roles and policies might be used by other ROSA clusters in the same AWS account. You must only remove the resources if they are not required by other clusters.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have deleted your ROSA cluster. For more information, see the _Deleting a cluster_ section.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must delete the cluster before you remove the IAM roles and policies. The account-wide roles are required to delete the resources created by the installer. The cluster-specific Operator roles are required to clean-up the resources created by the OpenShift Operators.
====

.Procedure

. Log in to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/home[AWS IAM Console].

. Delete the OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider that you created for Operator authentication in your cluster:
.. Navigate to *Access management* -> *Identity providers* and click on the OIDC resource that you created to authenticate the cluster Operators.
.. In the dialog page for the resource, select *Delete* to delete the OIDC provider.

. Delete the cluster-specific Operator IAM roles:

[TIP]
====
The IAM role and policy names include the role prefix that is specified when the STS resources are created. The default prefix is `ManagedOpenShift`.
====
+
.. Navigate to *Access management* -> *Roles* and click on one of the cluster-specific Operator roles that you created for your cluster.
.. In the dialog page for the resource, select *Delete role* to delete the role. Select *Yes, delete* to confirm the role deletion.
.. Repeat this step to delete each of the cluster-specific Operator roles for the cluster.

. Delete the account-wide Operator policies that you created for ROSA deployments that use STS:
.. Navigate to *Access management* -> *Policies* and click on one of the Operator policies.
.. In the dialog page for the resource, select *Delete policy* to delete the policy. Select *Delete* to confirm the policy deletion.
.. Repeat this step to delete each of the Operator policies.

. Delete the account-wide IAM roles and inline policies that you created for ROSA deployments that use STS:
.. Navigate to *Access management* -> *Roles* and click on one of the account-wide roles.
.. In the dialog page for the resource, select *Delete role* to delete the role. Select *Yes, delete* to confirm the role deletion.
.. Repeat this step to delete each of the account-wide roles for the cluster.
