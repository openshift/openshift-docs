= Running the cluster capacity tool on the command line

You can run the {product-title} cluster capacity tool from the command line
to estimate the number of pods that can be scheduled onto your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Run the link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/openshift4/ose-cluster-capacity/5cca0324d70cc57c44ae8eb6?container-tabs=overview[OpenShift Cluster Capacity Tool], which is available as a container image from the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog.

* Create a sample `Pod` spec file, which the tool uses for estimating resource usage. The `podspec` specifies its resource
requirements as `limits` or `requests`. The cluster capacity tool takes the
pod's resource requirements into account for its estimation analysis.
+
An example of the `Pod` spec input is:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: small-pod
  labels:
    app: guestbook
    tier: frontend
spec:
  containers:
  - name: php-redis
    image: gcr.io/google-samples/gb-frontend:v4
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 150m
        memory: 100Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 150m
        memory: 100Mi

.Procedure

To use the cluster capacity tool on the command line:

. From the terminal, log in to the Red Hat Registry:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman login registry.redhat.io
----

. Pull the cluster capacity tool image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman pull registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-cluster-capacity
----

. Run the cluster capacity tool:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman run -v $HOME/.kube:/kube:Z -v $(pwd):/cc:Z  ose-cluster-capacity \
/bin/cluster-capacity --kubeconfig /kube/config --podspec /cc/pod-spec.yaml \
--verbose <1>
----
<1> You can also add the `--verbose` option to output a detailed description of how many pods can be scheduled on each node in the cluster.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
small-pod pod requirements:
	- CPU: 150m
	- Memory: 100Mi

The cluster can schedule 88 instance(s) of the pod small-pod.

Termination reason: Unschedulable: 0/5 nodes are available: 2 Insufficient cpu,
3 node(s) had taint {node-role.kubernetes.io/master: }, that the pod didn't
tolerate.

Pod distribution among nodes:
small-pod
	- 192.168.124.214: 45 instance(s)
	- 192.168.124.120: 43 instance(s)
----
+
In the above example, the number of estimated pods that can be scheduled onto
the cluster is 88.
