= Monitoring PTP fast event metrics using the CLI

You can monitor fast events bus metrics directly from `cloud-event-proxy` containers using the `oc` CLI.

[NOTE]
====
PTP fast event notification metrics are also available in the {product-title} web console.
====

.Prerequisites

* Install the {product-title} CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Install and configure the PTP Operator.

.Procedure

. Get the list of active `linuxptp-daemon` pods.

. Access the metrics for the required `cloud-event-proxy` container by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -it <linuxptp-daemon> -n openshift-ptp -c cloud-event-proxy -- curl 127.0.0.1:9091/metrics

where:
+
<linuxptp-daemon>:: Specifies the pod you want to query, for example, `linuxptp-daemon-2t78p`.
