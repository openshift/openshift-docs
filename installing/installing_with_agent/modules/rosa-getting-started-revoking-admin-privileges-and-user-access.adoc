= Revoking administrator privileges and user access

You can revoke `cluster-admin` or `dedicated-admin` privileges from a user by using the ROSA CLI (`rosa`).

To revoke cluster access from a user, you must remove the user from your configured identity provider.

Follow the procedures in this section to revoke administrator privileges or cluster access from a user.
