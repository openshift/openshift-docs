[id="fixed-issues-1-3-2_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

The following issues have been resolved in the current release:

* Previously, in the OperatorHub UI under the *Infrastructure Features* section, when you filtered by `Disconnected` the {gitops-title} Operator did not show in the search results, as the Operator did not have the related annotation set in its CSV file. With this update, the `Disconnected Cluster` annotation has been added to the {gitops-title} Operator as an infrastructure feature. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-1539[GITOPS-1539]

* When using an `Namespace-scoped` Argo CD instance, for example, an Argo CD instance that is not scoped to *All Namepsaces* in a cluster, {gitops-title} dynamically maintains a list of managed namespaces. These namespaces include the `argocd.argoproj.io/managed-by` label. This list of namespaces is stored in a cache in *Argo CD -> Settings -> Clusters -> "in-cluster" -> NAMESPACES*. Before this update, if you deleted one of these namespaces, the Operator ignored that, and the namespace remained in the list. This behavior broke the *CONNECTION STATE* in that cluster configuration, and all sync attempts resulted in errors. For example:
+
[source,text]
----
Argo service account does not have <random_verb> on <random_resource_type> in namespace <the_namespace_you_deleted>. 
----
+
This bug is fixed. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-1521[GITOPS-1521]

* With this update, the {gitops-title} Operator has been annotated with the *Deep Insights* capability level. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-1519[GITOPS-1519]

* Previously, the Argo CD Operator managed the `resource.exclusion` field by itself but ignored the `resource.inclusion` field. This prevented the `resource.inclusion` field configured in the `Argo CD` CR to generate in the `argocd-cm` configuration map. This bug is fixed. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-1518[GITOPS-1518]
