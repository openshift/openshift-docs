= Configuring a secret for the Image Registry Operator

In addition to the `configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io` and ConfigMap
resources, configuration is provided to the Operator by a separate secret
resource located within the `openshift-image-registry` namespace.

The `image-registry-private-configuration-user` secret provides
credentials needed for storage access and management. It overrides the default
credentials used by the Operator, if default credentials were found.

For Swift on {rh-openstack-first} storage, the secret is expected to contain the following two keys:

* `REGISTRY_STORAGE_SWIFT_USER`
* `REGISTRY_STORAGE_SWIFT_PASSWORD`

.Procedure

* Create an {product-title} secret that contains the required keys.
