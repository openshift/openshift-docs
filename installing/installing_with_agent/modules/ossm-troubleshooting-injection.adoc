= Troubleshooting sidecar injection

{SMProductName} does not automatically inject proxy sidecars to pods. You must opt in to sidecar injection.

== Troubleshooting Istio sidecar injection

Check to see if automatic injection is enabled in the Deployment for your application. If automatic injection for the Envoy proxy is enabled, there should be a `sidecar.istio.io/inject:"true"` annotation in the `Deployment` resource under `spec.template.metadata.annotations`.

== Troubleshooting Jaeger agent sidecar injection

Check to see if automatic injection is enabled in the Deployment for your application. If automatic injection for the Jaeger agent is enabled, there should be a `sidecar.jaegertracing.io/inject:"true"` annotation in the `Deployment` resource.
