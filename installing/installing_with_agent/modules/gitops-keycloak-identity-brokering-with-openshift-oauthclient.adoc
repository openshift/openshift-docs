= Keycloak Identity Brokering with {product-title}

You can configure a Keycloak instance to use {product-title} for authentication through Identity Brokering. This allows for Single Sign-On (SSO) between the {product-title} cluster and the Keycloak instance.

.Prerequisites

* `jq` CLI tool is installed.


.Procedure

. Obtain the {product-title} API URL:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -s -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $(oc whoami -t)" https://<openshift-user-facing-api-url>/apis/config.openshift.io/v1/infrastructures/cluster | jq ".status.apiServerURL".
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The address of the {product-title} API is often protected by HTTPS. Therefore, you must configure X509_CA_BUNDLE in the container and set it to `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt`. Otherwise, Keycloak cannot communicate with the API Server.
====

. In the Keycloak server dashboard, navigate to *Identity Providers* and select *Openshift v4*. Specify the following values:
*Base Url*:: {product-title} 4 API URL
*Client ID*:: `keycloak-broker`
*Client Secret*:: A secret that you want define
+
Now you can log in to Argo CD with your {product-title} credentials through Keycloak as an Identity Broker.
