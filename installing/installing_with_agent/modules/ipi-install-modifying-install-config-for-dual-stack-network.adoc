= (Optional) Deploying with dual-stack networking

To deploy an {product-title} cluster with dual-stack networking, edit the `machineNetwork`, `clusterNetwork`, and `serviceNetwork` configuration settings in the `install-config.yaml` file. Each setting must have two CIDR entries each. Ensure the first CIDR entry is the IPv4 setting and the second CIDR entry is the IPv6 setting.

[source,yaml]
----
machineNetwork:
- cidr: {{ extcidrnet }}
- cidr: {{ extcidrnet6 }}
clusterNetwork:
- cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
  hostPrefix: 23
- cidr: fd02::/48
  hostPrefix: 64
serviceNetwork:
- 172.30.0.0/16
- fd03::/112

[IMPORTANT]
====
The API VIP IP address and the Ingress VIP address must be of the primary IP address family when using dual-stack networking. Currently, Red Hat does not support dual-stack VIPs or dual-stack networking with IPv6 as the primary IP address family. However, Red Hat does support dual-stack networking with IPv4 as the primary IP address family. Therefore, the IPv4 entries must go *before* the IPv6 entries.
