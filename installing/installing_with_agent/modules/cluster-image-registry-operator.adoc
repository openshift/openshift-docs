= Cluster Image Registry Operator

[discrete]
== Purpose

The Cluster Image Registry Operator manages a singleton instance of the {product-title} registry. It manages all configuration of the registry, including creating storage.

On initial start up, the Operator creates a default `image-registry` resource instance based on the configuration detected in the cluster. This indicates what cloud storage type to use based on the cloud provider.

If insufficient information is available to define a complete `image-registry` resource, then an incomplete resource is defined and the Operator updates the resource status with information about what is missing.

The Cluster Image Registry Operator runs in the `openshift-image-registry` namespace and it also manages the registry instance in that location. All configuration and workload resources for the registry reside in that namespace.
