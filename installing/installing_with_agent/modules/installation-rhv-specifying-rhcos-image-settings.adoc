= Specifying the {op-system} image settings

Update the {op-system-first} image settings of the `inventory.yml` file. Later, when you run this file one of the playbooks, it downloads a compressed {op-system-first} image from the `image_url` URL to the `local_cmp_image_path` directory. The playbook then uncompresses the image to the `local_image_path` directory and uses it to create oVirt/{rh-virtualization} templates.

// TBD - https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPRHV-414
// Consider combining this topic with another one after we've resolved the issue of getting the files.

. Locate the {op-system} image download page for the version of {product-title} you are installing, such as link:https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/4.10/latest/[Index of /pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/latest/latest].

. From that download page, copy the URL of an OpenStack `qcow2` image, such as `\https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/4.10/latest/rhcos-openstack.x86_64.qcow2.gz`.

. Edit the `inventory.yml` playbook you downloaded earlier. In it, paste the URL as the value for `image_url`. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
rhcos:
  "https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/4.10/latest/rhcos-openstack.x86_64.qcow2.gz"

. Locate the {op-system} image download page, such as link:https://getfedora.org/coreos/download?tab=cloud_operators&stream=stable[Download Fedora CoreOS].

. From that download page, copy the URL of an OpenStack `qcow2` image, such as `\https://builds.coreos.fedoraproject.org/prod/streams/stable/builds/34.20210611.3.0/x86_64/fedora-coreos-34.20210611.3.0-openstack.x86_64.qcow2.xz`.

. Edit the `inventory.yml` playbook you downloaded earlier. In it, replace the `rhcos` stanza and paste the URL as the value for `image_url`. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
rhcos:
  image_url: "https://builds.coreos.fedoraproject.org/prod/streams/stable/builds/34.20210611.3.0/x86_64/fedora-coreos-34.20210611.3.0-openstack.x86_64.qcow2.xz"
