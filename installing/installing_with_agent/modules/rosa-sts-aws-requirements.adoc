= Customer requirements when using STS for deployment

The following prerequisites must be complete before you deploy a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster that uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS).

[id="rosa-account_{context}"]
== Account
* You must ensure that the AWS limits are sufficient to support {product-title} provisioned within your AWS account. Running `rosa verify quota` in the CLI validates that you have the required quota to run a cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
Quota verification checks your AWS quota, but it does not compare your consumption to your AWS quota. See the "Limits and scalability" link in Additional resources for more information.
====
+
* If SCP policies are applied and enforced, these policies must not be more restrictive than the roles and policies required by the cluster.
* You may deploy native AWS services within the same AWS account.
* Your account must have a service-linked role set up as it is required for elastic load balancers (ELBs) to be configured. See AWS Limits in Additional resources for information about creating a service-linked role for your ELB if you have not created a load balancer in your AWS account previously.
+
[NOTE]
====
You are encouraged, but not required, to deploy resources in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) separate from the VPC hosting {product-title} and other Red Hat supported services.
====

[id="rosa-associating-account_{context}"]
== Associating your AWS account

{product-title} (ROSA) cluster-provisioning tasks require linking `ocm-role` and `user-role` {cluster-manager} IAM resources to your AWS account using your Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

The `ocm-role` ARN is stored as a label in your Red Hat organization while the `user-role` ARN is stored as a label inside your Red Hat user account. Red Hat uses these ARN labels to confirm that the user is a valid account holder and that the correct permissions are available to perform the necessary tasks in the AWS account.

.Prerequisites

* You have an AWS account.
* You have the permissions required to install AWS account-wide roles.
* You have installed and configured the latest AWS (`aws`) and ROSA (`rosa`) CLIs on your installation host.
* You have created your `ocm-role` and `user-role` IAM roles.

// Commenting out until ROSA UI release
//
// * You have an AWS account.
// * You are using {cluster-manager-url} to create clusters.
// * You have the permissions required to install AWS account-wide roles.
// * You have installed and configured the latest AWS (`aws`) and ROSA (`rosa`) CLIs on your installation host.
// * You have created your `ocm-role` and `user-role` IAM roles.
//
//  Commenting out until ROSA UI release

.Procedures

. From the CLI, link your `ocm-role` resource to your Red Hat organization by using your Amazon Resource Name (ARN):
+
[NOTE]
====
You must have organization administrator privileges to run the `rosa link` command. After you link the `ocm-role` resource with your AWS account, it is visible for all users in the organization.
====
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa link ocm-role --role-arn <arn>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
I: Linking OCM role
? Link the '<AWS ACCOUNT ID>` role with organization '<ORG ID>'? Yes
I: Successfully linked role-arn '<AWS ACCOUNT ID>' with organization account '<ORG ID>'
----
. From the CLI, link your `user-role` resource to your Red Hat user account by using your Amazon Resource Name (ARN):
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa link user-role --role-arn <arn>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
I: Linking User role
? Link the 'arn:aws:iam::<ARN>:role/ManagedOpenShift-User-Role-125' role with organization '<AWS ID>'? Yes
I: Successfully linked role-arn 'arn:aws:iam::<ARN>:role/ManagedOpenShift-User-Role-125' with organization account '<AWS ID>'

[id="rosa-associating-multiple-account_{context}"]
=== Associating multiple AWS accounts with your Red Hat organization

You can associate multiple AWS accounts with your Red Hat organization. Associating multiple accounts lets you create {product-title} (ROSA) clusters on any of the associated AWS accounts from your Red Hat organization.

With this feature, you can create clusters in different AWS regions by using multiple AWS profiles as region-bound environments.

.Specifying an AWS profile name when creating the OCM, user, and account roles

To associate an additional AWS account, first create a profile in your local AWS configuration. Then, associate the account with your Red Hat organization by creating the `ocm-role`, user, and account roles in the additional AWS account.

To create the roles in an additional region, specify the `--profile <aws-profile>` parameter when running the `rosa create` commands and replace `<aws_profile>` with the additional account profile name:

* To specify an AWS account profile when creating an {cluster-manager} role:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create --profile <aws_profile> ocm-role
----

* To specify an AWS account profile when creating a user role:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create --profile <aws_profile> user-role
----

* To specify an AWS account profile when creating the account roles:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create --profile <aws_profile> account-roles
----

[NOTE]
====
If you do not specify a profile, the default AWS profile is used.

[id="rosa-access-requirements_{context}"]
== Access requirements

* Red Hat must have AWS console access to the customer-provided AWS account. This access is protected and managed by Red Hat.
* You must not use the AWS account to elevate your permissions within the {product-title} cluster.
* Actions available in the `rosa` CLI utility or {cluster-manager-url} console must not be directly performed in your AWS account.
* You do not need to have a preconfigured domain to deploy ROSA clusters. If you want to use a custom domain, see Additional resources for information.

[id="rosa-support-requirements_{context}"]
== Support requirements
* Red Hat recommends that the customer have at least link:https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/[Business Support] from AWS.
* Red Hat may have permission from the customer to request AWS support on their behalf.
* Red Hat may have permission from the customer to request AWS resource limit increases on the customer's account.
* Red Hat manages the restrictions, limitations, expectations, and defaults for all {product-title} clusters in the same manner, unless otherwise specified in this requirements section.

[id="rosa-security-requirements_{context}"]
== Security requirements
* Volume snapshots will remain within the customer's AWS account and customer-specified region.
* Red Hat must have ingress access to EC2 hosts and the API server from allow-listed IP addresses.
* Red Hat must have egress allowed to the documented domains. See the "AWS firewall prerequisites" section for the designated domains.
