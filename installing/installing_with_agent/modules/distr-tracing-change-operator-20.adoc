= Changing the Operator channel for 2.0

{DTProductName} 2.0.0 made the following changes:

* Renamed the Red Hat OpenShift Jaeger Operator to the {JaegerName} Operator.

* Stopped support for individual release channels. Going forward, the {JaegerName} Operator will only support the *stable* Operator channel. Maintenance channels, for example *1.24-stable*, will no longer be supported by future Operators.

As part of the update to version 2.0, you must update your OpenShift Elasticsearch and {JaegerName} Operator subscriptions.

.Prerequisites

* The {product-title} version is 4.6 or later.
* You have updated the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator.
* You have backed up the Jaeger custom resource file.
* An account with the `cluster-admin` role. If you use {product-dedicated}, you must have an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.
