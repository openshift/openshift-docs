= Permissions and RBAC manifests

The controller requires certain role-based access control (RBAC) permissions to interact with the resources it manages. For the Go API, these are specified with RBAC markers, as shown in the Operator SDK tutorial for standard Go-based Operators.

For the Helm API, the permissions are scaffolded by default in `roles.yaml`. Currently, however, due to a known issue when the Go API is scaffolded, the permissions for the Helm API are overwritten. As a result of this issue, ensure that the permissions defined in `roles.yaml` match your requirements.

[NOTE]
====
This known issue is being tracked in link:https://github.com/operator-framework/helm-operator-plugins/issues/142[].

The following is an example `role.yaml` for a Memcached Operator:
