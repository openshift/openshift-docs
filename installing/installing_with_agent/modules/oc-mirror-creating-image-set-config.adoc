= Creating the image set configuration

Before you can use the oc-mirror plug-in to mirror image sets, you must create an image set configuration file. This image set configuration file defines which {product-title} releases, Operators, and other images to mirror, along with other configuration settings for the oc-mirror plug-in.

You must specify a storage backend in the image set configuration file. This storage backend can be a local directory or a registry that supports link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2[Docker v2-2]. The oc-mirror plug-in stores metadata in this storage backend during image set creation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not delete or modify the metadata that is generated by the oc-mirror plug-in. You must use the same storage backend every time you run the oc-mirror plug-in for the same mirror registry.
====

.Procedure

. Create an `ImageSetConfiguration` resource that specifies the necessary configuration details:
+
.Example `ImageSetConfiguration` file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ImageSetConfiguration
archiveSize: 4 <1>
mirror:
 ocp:
   channels:
     - name: stable-4.9 <2>
 operators:
   - catalog: registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.9 <3>
storageConfig: <4>
 registry:
   imageURL: example.com/example/oc-mirror <5>
----
<1> The maximum size, in GiB, of each file within the image set.
<2> The channel to retrieve the {product-title} images from.
<3> The Operator catalog to retrieve the {product-title} images from.
<4> The back-end location to save the image set metadata to. This location can be a registry or local directory. It is required to specify `storageConfig` values.
<5> The registry URL for the storage backend.
+
This example pulls images from the `stable-4.9` channel for the `registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.9` operator catalog and saves the image set metadata to the `example.com/example/oc-mirror` registry.

. Save the file as `imageset-config.yaml`. This file is required by the `oc mirror` command when mirroring content.
