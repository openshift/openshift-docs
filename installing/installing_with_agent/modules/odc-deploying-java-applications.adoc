= Upload JAR files for easy deployment of Java applications

You can use the JAR files in the *Topology* view of the *Developer* perspective to deploy your Java applications. You can upload a JAR file using the following options:

* Navigate to the *+Add* view of the *Developer* perspective, and click *Upload JAR file* in the *From Local Machine* tile. Browse and select your JAR file, or drag and drop a JAR file to deploy your application.

* Navigate to the *Topology* view and use the *Upload JAR file* option, or drag and drop a JAR file to deploy your application.

* Use the in-context menu in the *Topology* view, and then use the *Upload JAR file* option to upload your JAR file to deploy your application.

Use the following instructions to upload a JAR file in the *Topology* view to deploy a Java application:

.Procedure

. In the *Topology* view, right-click anywhere in the *Topology* view to see the *Add to Project* menu.

. Hover over the *Add to Project* menu to see the menu options, and then select the *Upload JAR file* option to see the *Upload JAR file* form . Alternatively, you can drag and drop the JAR file in the *Topology* view.

. In the *JAR file* field, browse for the required JAR file on your local machine and upload it. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the JAR file on the field. A toast alert is displayed at the top right if an incompatible file type is dragged and dropped on the *Topology* view. A field error is displayed if an incompatible file type is dropped on the field in the upload form.

. You can further specify optional Java commands to customize your deployed application. The Runtime Icon and Builder Image is selected by default. If a Builder Image is not auto-detected, select a Builder Image. If required, you can change the version using the *Builder Image Version* drop-down list.

. In the optional *Application Name* field, enter a unique name for your application for the resource labelling.

. In the *Name* field, enter a unique component name to name the associated resources.

. In the *Resources* field, choose the resource type for your application.

. In the *Advanced options*, click on *Create a Route to the Application* to configure a public URL for your deployed application.

. Click *Create* to deploy the application. The user sees a toast notification notifying that the JAR file is being uploaded and takes a while. The toast notification also includes a link to view the build logs.

[NOTE]
====
If the user attempts to close the browser tab while the build is running, a web alert would be displayed asking the user if they actually want to leave the page.

After the JAR file is uploaded and the application is deployed, you can see the deployment in the *Topology* view.
