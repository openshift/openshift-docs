= Using Bitbucket webhooks

link:https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/manage-webhooks-735643732.html[Bitbucket webhooks] handle the call made by Bitbucket when a repository is updated. Similar to the previous triggers, you must specify a secret. The following example is a trigger definition YAML within the `BuildConfig`:

[source,yaml]
----
type: "Bitbucket"
bitbucket:
  secretReference:
    name: "mysecret"
----

The payload URL is returned as the Bitbucket Webhook URL by the `oc describe` command, and is structured as follows:

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/bitbucket
----

.Procedure

. To configure a Bitbucket Webhook:

.. Describe the 'BuildConfig' to get the webhook URL:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe bc <name>
----

.. Copy the webhook URL, replacing `<secret>` with your secret value.

.. Follow the link:https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/manage-webhooks-735643732.html[Bitbucket setup instructions] to paste the webhook URL into your Bitbucket repository settings.

. Given a file containing a valid JSON payload, such as `payload.json`, you can
manually trigger the webhook with `curl`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -H "X-Event-Key: repo:push" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -k -X POST --data-binary @payload.json https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/bitbucket
----
+
The `-k` argument is only necessary if your API server does not have a properly signed certificate.
