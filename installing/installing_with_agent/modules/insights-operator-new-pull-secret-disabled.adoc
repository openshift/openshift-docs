= Modifying the global cluster pull secret to disable remote health reporting

You can modify your existing global cluster pull secret to disable remote health reporting. This disables both Telemetry and the Insights Operator.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Download the global cluster pull secret to your local file system.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc extract secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --to=.
----

. In a text editor, edit the `.dockerconfigjson` file that was downloaded.

. Remove the `cloud.openshift.com` JSON entry, for example:
+
[source,json]
----
"cloud.openshift.com":{"auth":"<hash>","email":"<email_address>"}
----

. Save the file.

You can now update your cluster to use this modified pull secret.
