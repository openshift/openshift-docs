= Setting up the rosa CLI


To set up the `rosa` CLI, download the latest release, then configure and initialize `rosa`:

.Procedure

. Download the latest release of the `rosa` CLI for your operating system from the *Download* page of link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-service-aws/[{product-title}]. 
+
. It is recommended that after you download the release, you rename the executable file that you downloaded to `rosa`, and then add `rosa` to your path.
+
. Optional: After downloading `rosa`, enable Bash completion for `rosa`. Bash completion helps to automatically complete commands and suggest options when you press `Tab`. The command generates a Bash completion file for `rosa` and sources it to your current shell session.
+
To configure your Bash shell to load `rosa` completions for each session, add the following command to your `Bashrc` file (`~/.Bashrc` or `~/.profile`).
