= About adding RHEL compute nodes to a cluster

In {product-title} {product-version}, you have the option of using {op-system-base-full} machines as compute machines in your cluster if you use a user-provisioned infrastructure installation on the `x86_64` architecture. You must use {op-system-first} machines for the control plane machines in your cluster.

If you choose to use {op-system-base} compute machines in your cluster, you are responsible for all operating system life cycle management and maintenance. You must perform system updates, apply patches, and complete all other required tasks.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Because removing {product-title} from a machine in the cluster requires destroying the operating system, you must use dedicated hardware for any {op-system-base} machines that you add to the cluster.

* Swap memory is disabled on all {op-system-base} machines that you add to your {product-title} cluster. You cannot enable swap memory on these machines.
====

You must add any {op-system-base} compute machines to the cluster after you initialize the control plane.
