= The 3scale WebAssembly module system object

The `system` top-level object specifies how to access the 3scale Account Management API for a specific account. The `upstream` field is the most important part of the object. The `system` object is optional, but recommended unless you are providing a fully static configuration for the 3scale WebAssembly module, which is an option if you do not want to provide connectivity to the _system_ component of 3scale.

When you provide static configuration objects in addition to the `system` object, the static ones always take precedence.
