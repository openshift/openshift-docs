= Exploring the daemon sets

Each `FileIntegrity` object represents a scan on a number of nodes. The scan
itself is performed by pods managed by a daemon set.

To find the daemon set that represents a `FileIntegrity` object, run:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ds/aide-ds-$file-integrity-object-name
----

To list the pods in that daemon set, run:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -lapp=$ds-name
----

To view logs of a single AIDE pod, call `oc logs` on one of the pods.

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
debug: aide files locked by aideLoop
running aide check
aide check returned status 0
debug: aide files unlocked by aideLoop
debug: Getting FileIntegrity openshift-file-integrity/worker-fileintegrity
Created OK configMap 'aide-ds-worker-fileintegrity-ip-10-0-128-73.eu-north-1.compute.internal'
----

The config maps created by the AIDE daemon are not retained and are deleted
after the File Integrity Operator processes them. However, on failure and error,
the contents of these config maps are copied to the config map that the
`FileIntegrityNodeStatus` object points to.
