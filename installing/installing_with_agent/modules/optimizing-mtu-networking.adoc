= Optimizing the MTU for your network

There are two important maximum transmission units (MTUs): the network interface controller (NIC) MTU and the cluster network MTU.

The NIC MTU is only configured at the time of {product-title} installation. The MTU must be less than or equal to the maximum supported value of the NIC of your network. If you are optimizing for throughput, choose the largest possible value. If you are optimizing for lowest latency, choose a lower value.

The SDN overlay's MTU must be less than the NIC MTU by 50 bytes at a minimum. This accounts for the SDN overlay header. So, on a normal ethernet network, set this to `1450`. On a jumbo frame ethernet network, set this to `8950`.

For OVN and Geneve, the MTU must be less than the NIC MTU by 100 bytes at a minimum.

[NOTE]
====
This 50 byte overlay header is relevant to the OpenShift SDN. Other SDN solutions might require the value to be more or less.
