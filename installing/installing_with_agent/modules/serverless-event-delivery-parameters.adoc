= Configurable event delivery parameters

Knative Eventing provides configuration parameters that can be used to control what happens to events in cases where events fail to be delivered. For example, you can configure Knative to retry sending events that failed to be consumed, or forward these events to a dead letter sink.

The following parameters can be configured for event delivery:

Dead letter sink:: You can configure the `deadLetterSink` delivery parameter so that if an event fails to be delivered it is sent to the specified event sink.

Retries:: You can set a minimum number of times that the delivery must be retried before the event is sent to the dead letter sink, by configuring the `retry` delivery parameter with an integer value.

Back off delay:: You can set the `backoffDelay` delivery parameter to specify the time delay before an event delivery retry is attempted after a failure. The duration of the `backoffDelay` parameter is specified using the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations[ISO 8601] format.

Back off policy:: The `backoffPolicy` delivery parameter can be used to specify the retry back off policy. The policy can be specified as either `linear` or `exponential`. When using the `linear` back off policy, the back off delay is the time interval specified between retries. When using the `exponential` backoff policy, the back off delay is equal to `backoffDelay*2^<numberOfRetries>`.
