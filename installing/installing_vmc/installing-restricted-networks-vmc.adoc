In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on VMware vSphere infrastructure in a restricted network by deploying it to link:https://cloud.vmware.com/vmc-aws[VMware Cloud (VMC) on AWS].

Once you configure your VMC environment for {product-title} deployment, you use the {product-title} installation program from the bastion management host, co-located in the VMC environment. The installation program and control plane automates the process of deploying and managing the resources needed for the {product-title} cluster.

== vSphere prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:../../installing/installing-mirroring-installation-images.adoc#installing-mirroring-installation-images[created a registry on your mirror host] and obtained the `imageContentSources` data for your version of {product-title}.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the installation media is on the mirror host, you can use that computer to complete all installation steps.
====
* You provisioned xref:../../registry/configuring_registry_storage/configuring-registry-storage-vsphere.adoc#installation-registry-storage-block-recreate-rollout_configuring-registry-storage-vsphere[block registry storage]. For more information on persistent storage, see xref:../../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#understanding-persistent-storage[Understanding persistent storage].
* If you use a firewall and plan to use the Telemetry service, you xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured the firewall to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are configuring a proxy, be sure to also review this site list.
