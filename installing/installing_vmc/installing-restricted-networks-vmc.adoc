In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on VMware vSphere infrastructure in a restricted network by deploying it to link:https://cloud.vmware.com/vmc-aws[VMware Cloud (VMC) on AWS].

Once you configure your VMC environment for {product-title} deployment, you use the {product-title} installation program from the bastion management host, co-located in the VMC environment. The installation program and control plane automates the process of deploying and managing the resources needed for the {product-title} cluster.
