== Requirements for installing {product-title} on IBM Cloud VPC

Before installing {product-title} on IBM Cloud Power VS, you must create a service account and configure an IBM Cloud account. See xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud_public/installing-ibm-cloud-account.adoc#installing-ibm-cloud-account[Configuring an IBM Cloud VPC account] for details about creating an account, configuring DNS and supported IBM Cloud Power VS regions.

You must manually manage your cloud credentials when installing a cluster to IBM Cloud Power VS. Do this by configuring the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) for manual mode before you install the cluster. For more information, see xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud_public/configuring-iam-ibm-cloud.adoc#configuring-iam-ibm-cloud[Configuring IAM for IBM Cloud VPC].

[id="choosing-a-method-to-install-ocp-on-ibm-cloud"]
== Choosing a method to install {product-title} on IBM Cloud VPC

You can install {product-title} on IBM Cloud Power VS using installer-provisioned infrastructure. This process involves using an installation program to provision the underlying infrastructure for your cluster.

See xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#installation-process_architecture-installation[Installation process] for more information about installer-provisioned installation processes.

=== Installing a cluster on installer-provisioned infrastructure

You can install a cluster on IBM Cloud Power VS infrastructure that is provisioned by the {product-title} installation program by using one of the following methods:

* **xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud_public/installing-ibm-cloud-customizations.adoc#installing-ibm-cloud-customizations[Installing a customized cluster on IBM Cloud VPC]**: You can install a customized cluster on IBM Cloud VPC infrastructure that the installation program provisions. The installation program allows for some customization to be applied at the installation stage. Many other customization options are available xref:../../post_installation_configuration/cluster-tasks.adoc#post-install-cluster-tasks[post-installation].
