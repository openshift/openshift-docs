You can use the procedures in this section to ensure your clusters only use container images that satisfy your organizational controls on external content. Before you install a cluster on infrastructure that you provision in a restricted network, you must mirror the required container images into that environment. To mirror container images, you must have a registry for mirroring.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must have access to the internet to obtain the necessary container images.
In this procedure, you place your mirror registry on a mirror host
that has access to both your network and the Internet. If you do not have access
to a mirror host, use the xref:../operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.html#olm-mirror-catalog_olm-restricted-networks[Mirroring an Operator catalog] procedure to copy images to a device you can move across network boundaries with.

== Prerequisites

* You must have a container image registry that supports link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2[Docker v2-2] in the location that will host the {product-title} cluster, such as one of the following registries:

If you have an entitlement to Red Hat Quay, see the documentation on deploying Red Hat Quay link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3.5/html/deploy_red_hat_quay_for_proof-of-concept_non-production_purposes/[for proof-of-concept purposes] or link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3.5/html/deploy_red_hat_quay_on_openshift_with_the_quay_operator/[by using the Quay Operator]. If you need additional assistance selecting and installing a registry, contact your sales representative or Red Hat support.

* If you do not already have an existing solution for a container image registry, subscribers of {product-title} are provided a xref:../installing/installing-mirroring-installation-images.adoc#mirror-registry[mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift]. The _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ is included with your subscription and is a small-scale container registry that can be used to mirror the required container images of {product-title} in disconnected installations.

== Preparing your mirror host

Before you perform the mirror procedure, you must prepare the host to retrieve content
and push it to the remote location.

== Mirroring the content

In production environments, add the required images to a registry in your restricted network. For non-production environments, you can use the images without a separate registry.

[id="mirror-registry"]
== Mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift

The _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ is a small and streamlined container registry that you can use as a target for mirroring the required container images of {product-title} for disconnected installations.

If you already have a container image registry, such as Red Hat Quay, you can skip these steps and go straight to xref:../installing/installing-mirroring-installation-images.adoc#installation-mirror-repository_installing-mirroring-installation-images[Mirroring the OpenShift Container Platform image repository].

.Prerequisites

* An {product-title} subscription.
* {op-system-base-full} 8 with Podman 3.3 installed.
* Fully qualified domain name for the Red Hat Quay service, which must resolve through a DNS server.
* Passwordless `sudo` access on the target host.
* Key-based SSH connectivity on the target host. SSH keys are automatically generated for local installs. For remote hosts, you must generate your own SSH keys.
* 2 or more vCPUs.
* 8 GB of RAM.
* About 6.8 GB for {product-title} 4.6 Release images, or about 696 GB for {product-title} 4.6 Release images and {product-title} 4.6 Red Hat Operator images. Up to 1 TB per stream or more is suggested.

[IMPORTANT]
====
These requirements are based on local testing results with only Release images and Operator images tested. Storage requirements can vary based on your organization's needs. Some users might require more space, for example, when they mirror multiple z-streams. You can use standard Red Hat Quay functionality to remove unnecessary images and free up space.
