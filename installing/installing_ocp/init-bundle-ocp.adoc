To authenticate your secured clusters with Central in Red{nbsp}Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS), you must generate and apply valid credentials. You can create an init bundle by using the RHACS portal for interactive management, or use the `roxctl` CLI to generate a cluster registration secret (CRS) for automation. Applying the resulting YAML file to your cluster enables secure communication between services.
