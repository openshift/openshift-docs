Before you install the `SecuredCluster` resource on a cluster, you must create an init bundle. The cluster that has `SecuredCluster` installed and configured then uses this bundle to authenticate with Central. You can create an init bundle by using either the {product-title-short} portal or the `roxctl` CLI. You then apply the init bundle by using it to create resources.

//add temporary references to Cloud docs until GUI link is changed - ROX-13795 - then this is no longer needed
To configure an init bundle for {product-title-short}, see the following resources:
