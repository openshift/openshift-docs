toc::[]

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on
bare metal infrastructure that you provision in a restricted network.

[IMPORTANT]
====
While you might be able to follow this procedure to deploy a cluster on
virtualized or cloud environments, you must be aware of additional
considerations for non-bare metal platforms. Review the information in the
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4207611[guidelines for deploying {product-title} on non-tested platforms]
before you attempt to install an {product-title} cluster in such an environment.

.Prerequisites

* xref:../../installing/install_config/installing-restricted-networks-preparations.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-preparations[Create a mirror registry on your bastion host] and obtain the `imageContentSources` data for your version of {product-title}.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Because the installation media is on the bastion host, use that computer
to complete all installation steps.
====
* Provision
xref:../../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage]
for your cluster. To deploy a private image registry, your storage must provide
ReadWriteMany access modes.
* Review details about the
xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update]
processes.
* If you use a firewall and plan to use telemetry, you must

Be sure to also review this site list if you are configuring a proxy.

== Creating {op-system-first} machines

Before you install a cluster on bare metal infrastructure that you provision,
you must create {op-system} machines for it to use. Follow either the steps
to use an ISO image or network PXE booting to create the machines.
