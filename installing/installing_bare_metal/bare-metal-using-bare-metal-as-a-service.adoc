The Bare Metal as a Service (BMaaS) feature for {product-title} enables you to provision and manage bare-metal hosts by using the Metal^3^ API and the Bare Metal Operator (BMO). These hosts, external to the {product-title} cluster, can run workloads that might not be suitable for containerization or virtualization. For example, workloads such as applications that require direct hardware access, conduct high-performance computing tasks or are legacy applications. BMaaS has the following capabilities:

* Provisioning of bare-metal hosts, including initial configuration.
* Lifecycle management such as power management, firmware updates, and decommissioning by using the BMO.

As standalone systems, these hosts operate independently of the {product-title} cluster and support diverse workloads by integrating bare-metal resources with containerized and virtualized applications. BMaaS can run other operating systems, but only {op-system-base-full} and CentOS Stream 9 were tested.
