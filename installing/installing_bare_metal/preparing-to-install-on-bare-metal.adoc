== Choosing a method to install {product-title} on bare metal

The {product-title} installation program offers four methods for deploying a cluster:

* *Interactive*: You can deploy a cluster with the web-based link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform/2022/html-single/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform/index[{ai-full}]. This is the recommended approach for clusters with networks connected to the internet. The {ai-full} is the easiest way to install {product-title}, it provides smart defaults, and it performs pre-flight validations before installing the cluster. It also provides a RESTful API for automation and advanced configuration scenarios.

* *Local Agent-based*: You can deploy a cluster locally with the xref:../../installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer.adoc#preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer[agent-based installer] for air-gapped or restricted networks. It provides many of the benefits of the {ai-full}, but you must download and configure the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/metal/agent-based[agent-based installer] first. Configuration is done with a commandline interface. This approach is ideal for air-gapped or restricted networks.

* *Automated*: You can xref:../../installing/installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-overview.adoc#ipi-install-overview[deploy a cluster on installer-provisioned infrastructure] and the cluster it maintains. The installer uses each cluster host's baseboard management controller (BMC) for provisioning. You can deploy clusters with both connected or air-gapped or restricted networks.

* *Full control*: You can deploy a cluster on xref:../../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.adoc#installing-bare-metal[infrastructure that you prepare and maintain], which provides maximum customizability. You can deploy clusters with both connected or air-gapped or restricted networks.

The clusters have the following characteristics:

* Highly available infrastructure with no single points of failure is available by default.
* Administrators maintain control over what updates are applied and when.

See xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#installation-process_architecture-installation[Installation process] for more information about installer-provisioned and user-provisioned installation processes.

=== Installing a cluster on installer-provisioned infrastructure

You can install a cluster on bare metal infrastructure that is provisioned by the {product-title} installation program, by using the following method:

* **xref:../../installing/installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-overview.adoc#ipi-install-overview[Installing an installer-provisioned cluster on bare metal]**: You can install {product-title} on bare metal by using installer provisioning.

[id="choosing-a-method-to-install-ocp-on-bare-metal-user-provisioned"]
=== Installing a cluster on user-provisioned infrastructure

You can install a cluster on bare metal infrastructure that you provision, by using one of the following methods:

* **xref:../../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.adoc#installing-bare-metal[Installing a user-provisioned cluster on bare metal]**: You can install {product-title} on bare metal infrastructure that you provision. For a cluster that contains user-provisioned infrastructure, you must deploy all of the required machines.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal-network-customizations.adoc#installing-bare-metal-network-customizations[Installing a user-provisioned bare metal cluster with network customizations]**: You can install a bare metal cluster on user-provisioned infrastructure with network-customizations. By customizing your network configuration, your cluster can coexist with existing IP address allocations in your environment and integrate with existing MTU and VXLAN configurations. Most of the network customizations must be applied at the installation stage.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-restricted-networks-bare-metal.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-bare-metal[Installing a user-provisioned bare metal cluster on a restricted network]**: You can install a user-provisioned bare metal cluster on a restricted or disconnected network by using a mirror registry. You can also use this installation method to ensure that your clusters only use container images that satisfy your organizational controls on external content.
