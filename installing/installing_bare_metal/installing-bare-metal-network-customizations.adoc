toc::[]

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on bare
metal infrastructure that you provision with customized network configuration
options. By customizing your network configuration, your cluster can coexist
with existing IP address allocations in your environment and integrate with
existing MTU and VXLAN configurations.

You must set most of the network configuration parameters during installation,
and you can modify only `kubeProxy` configuration parameters in a running
cluster.

== Prerequisites

* Review details about the
xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update]
processes.
* If you use a firewall, you must
xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configure it to access Red Hat Insights].

== Creating {op-system-first} machines

Before you install a cluster on bare metal infrastructure that you provision,
you must create {op-system} machines for it to use. To create the machines, follow either the steps
to use an ISO image or network PXE booting.

There are several methods of configuring {op-system} during ISO and
PXE installations. These include:

* Kernel arguments: For a PXE install, you can `APPEND` arguments to the
kernel of the live installer. For an ISO install, you can interrupt the
live install boot process to add kernel arguments. In both cases, you can use
special `coreos.inst.*` arguments to direct the installer, as well as
standard boot arguments for turning standard kernel services
on or off.

* Ignition configs: You need to generate an {product-title} Ignition config file
(`*.ign`) for the type of node you are installing (worker, control plane,
or bootstrap). You pass the location of the Ignition config to the installed
system so that it takes effect on first boot. In special cases, you can create a
separate, limited Ignition config to pass to the live system. That Ignition config could do a certain set of tasks, such as reporting success to a provisioning system
after completing installation. This special Ignition config is consumed by the installer and should not
be used to include the standard `worker` and `master` Ignition configs.

* `coreos-installer`: You can boot the live ISO installer to a shell prompt,
which allows you to prepare the permanent system in a variety of ways
before first boot. In particular, you can run the `coreos-installer`
command to identify various artifacts to include, work with disk partitions,
and set up networking. In some cases, you can configure features on
the live system and copy them to the installed system.

Whether to use an ISO or PXE install depends on your situation.
A PXE install requires an available DHCP service and more preparation,
but can make the installation process more automated. An ISO install
is a more manual process and can be inconvenient if you are setting
up more than a few machines.
