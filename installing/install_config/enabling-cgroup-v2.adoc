By default, {product-title} uses link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v1.html[Linux control group version 1] (cgroup v1) in your cluster. You can enable link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html[Linux control group version 2] (cgroup v2) upon installation. Enabling cgroup v2 in {product-title} disables all cgroup version 1 controllers and hierarchies in your cluster.

cgroup v2 is the next version of the Linux cgroup API. cgroup v2 offers several improvements over cgroup v1, including a unified hierarchy, safer sub-tree delegation, new features such as link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/accounting/psi.html[Pressure Stall Information], and enhanced resource management and isolation. 

You can switch between cgroup v1 and cgroup v2, as needed, by editing the the `node.config` object. For more information, see "Configuring the Linux cgroup on your nodes" in the "Additional resources" of this section.
