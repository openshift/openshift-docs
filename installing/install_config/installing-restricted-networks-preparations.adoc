Before you install a cluster on infrastructure that you provision in a restricted network, you must mirror the required container images into that environment. Installations on a restricted network are supported on only infrastructure that you provision, not infrastructure that the installer provisions. You can also use this procedure in unrestricted networks to ensure your clusters only use container images that have satisfied your organizational controls on external content.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must have access to the internet to obtain the necessary container images.
In this procedure, you place the mirror registry on a mirror host
that has access to both your network and the internet. If you do not have access
to a mirror host, use the disconnected procedure to copy images to a device you
can move across network boundaries with.

== Preparing your mirror host

Before you perform the mirror procedure, you must prepare the host to retrieve content
and push it to the remote location.

== Mirroring the content

In production environments, add the required images to a registry in your restricted network. For non-production environments, you can use the images without a separate registry.
