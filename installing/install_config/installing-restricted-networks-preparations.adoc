toc::[]

Before you install a cluster on infrastructure that you provision in a restricted network, you must create a mirror registry. Installations on a restricted network are supported on only infrastructure that you provision, not infrastructure that the installer provisions.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must have access to the internet to obtain the data that populates the mirror
repository. In this procedure, you place the mirror registry on a bastion host
that has access to both your network and the internet. If you do not have access
to a bastion host, use the method that best fits your restrictions to bring the
contents of the mirror registry into your restricted network.
