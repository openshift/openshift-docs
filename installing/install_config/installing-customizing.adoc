Although directly making changes to {product-title} nodes is discouraged,
there are times when it is necessary to implement a
required low-level security, networking, or performance feature.
Direct changes to {product-title} nodes can be done by:

* Creating MachineConfigs that are included in manifest files
to start up a cluster during `openshift-install`.

* Creating MachineConfigs that are passed to running
{product-title} nodes via the Machine Config Operator.

The following sections describe features that you might want to
configure on your nodes in this way.
