While we discourage making changes directly to {product-title} nodes,
there are times when that is necessary to implement a
required low-level security, networking, or performance feature.
Direct changes to {product-title} nodes can be done by:

* Creating Ignition configs that are included in manifest files
to start up a cluster during `openshift-install`

* Creating Ignition configs that are passed to running
{product-title} nodes through MachineConfig objects

The following sections describe features that you might want to
configure on your nodes in this way.
