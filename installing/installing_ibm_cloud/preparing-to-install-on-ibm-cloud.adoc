The installation workflows documented in this section are for {ibm-cloud-name} infrastructure environments. {ibm-cloud-name} classic is not supported at this time. For more information about the difference between classic and VPC infrastructures, see the {ibm-name} link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-infrastructure?topic=cloud-infrastructure-compare-infrastructure[documentation].

[id="prerequisites_preparing-to-install-on-ibm-cloud"]
== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.

* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/overview/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].

[id="requirements-for-installing-ocp-on-ibm-cloud"]
== Requirements for installing {product-title} on {ibm-cloud-title}

Before installing {product-title} on {ibm-cloud-name}, you must create a service account and configure an {ibm-cloud-name} account. See xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud/installing-ibm-cloud-account.adoc#installing-ibm-cloud-account[Configuring an {ibm-cloud-name} account] for details about creating an account, enabling API services, configuring DNS, {ibm-cloud-name} account limits, and supported {ibm-cloud-name} regions.

You must manually manage your cloud credentials when installing a cluster to {ibm-cloud-name}. Do this by configuring the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) for manual mode before you install the cluster. For more information, see xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud/configuring-iam-ibm-cloud.adoc#configuring-iam-ibm-cloud[Configuring IAM for {ibm-cloud-name}].

== Choosing a method to install {product-title} on {ibm-cloud-title}

You can install {product-title} on {ibm-cloud-name} using installer-provisioned infrastructure. This process involves using an installation program to provision the underlying infrastructure for your cluster. Installing {product-title} on {ibm-cloud-name} using user-provisioned infrastructure is not supported at this time.

See xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#installation-process_architecture-installation[Installation process] for more information about installer-provisioned installation processes.

=== Installing a cluster on installer-provisioned infrastructure

You can install a cluster on {ibm-cloud-name} infrastructure that is provisioned by the {product-title} installation program by using one of the following methods:

* **xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud/installing-ibm-cloud-customizations.adoc#installing-ibm-cloud-customizations[Installing a customized cluster on {ibm-cloud-name}]**: You can install a customized cluster on {ibm-cloud-name} infrastructure that the installation program provisions. The installation program allows for some customization to be applied at the installation stage. Many other customization options are available xref:../../post_installation_configuration/cluster-tasks.adoc#post-install-cluster-tasks[post-installation].

* **xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud/installing-ibm-cloud-network-customizations.adoc#installing-ibm-cloud-network-customizations[Installing a cluster on {ibm-cloud-name} with network customizations]**: You can customize your {product-title} network configuration during installation, so that your cluster can coexist with your existing IP address allocations and adhere to your network requirements.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud/installing-ibm-cloud-vpc.adoc#installing-ibm-cloud-vpc[Installing a cluster on {ibm-cloud-name} into an existing VPC]**: You can install {product-title} on an existing {ibm-cloud-name}. You can use this installation method if you have constraints set by the guidelines of your company, such as limits when creating new accounts or infrastructure.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud/installing-ibm-cloud-private.adoc#installing-ibm-cloud-private[Installing a private cluster on an existing VPC]**: You can install a private cluster on an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). You can use this method to deploy {product-title} on an internal network that is not visible to the internet.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud/installing-ibm-cloud-restricted.adoc#installing-ibm-cloud-restricted[Installing a cluster on {ibm-cloud-title} in a restricted network]**: You can install {product-title} on {ibm-cloud-title} on installer-provisioned infrastructure by using an internal mirror of the installation release content. You can use this method to install a cluster that does not require an active internet connection to obtain the software components.
