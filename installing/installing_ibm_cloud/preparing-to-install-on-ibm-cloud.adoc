You can install {product-title} on {ibm-cloud-name} using installer-provisioned infrastructure. This process involves using an installation program to provision the underlying infrastructure for your cluster. Installing {product-title} on {ibm-cloud-name} using user-provisioned infrastructure is not supported at this time.

See xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#installation-process_architecture-installation[Installation process] for more information about installer-provisioned installation processes.

== Installing a cluster on installer-provisioned infrastructure

You can install a cluster on {ibm-cloud-name} infrastructure that is provisioned by the {product-title} installation program by using one of the following methods:

* **xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud/installing-ibm-cloud-customizations.adoc#installing-ibm-cloud-customizations[Installing a customized cluster on {ibm-cloud-name}]**: You can install a customized cluster on {ibm-cloud-name} infrastructure that the installation program provisions. The installation program allows for some customization to be applied at the installation stage. Many other customization options are available xref:../../post_installation_configuration/cluster-tasks.adoc#post-install-cluster-tasks[post-installation].

* **xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud/installing-ibm-cloud-network-customizations.adoc#installing-ibm-cloud-network-customizations[Installing a cluster on {ibm-cloud-name} with network customizations]**: You can customize your {product-title} network configuration during installation, so that your cluster can coexist with your existing IP address allocations and adhere to your network requirements.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud/installing-ibm-cloud-vpc.adoc#installing-ibm-cloud-vpc[Installing a cluster on {ibm-cloud-name} into an existing VPC]**: You can install {product-title} on an existing {ibm-cloud-name}. You can use this installation method if you have constraints set by the guidelines of your company, such as limits when creating new accounts or infrastructure.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud/installing-ibm-cloud-private.adoc#installing-ibm-cloud-private[Installing a private cluster on an existing VPC]**: You can install a private cluster on an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). You can use this method to deploy {product-title} on an internal network that is not visible to the internet.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_cloud/installing-ibm-cloud-restricted.adoc#installing-ibm-cloud-restricted[Installing a cluster on {ibm-cloud-title} in a restricted network]**: You can install {product-title} on {ibm-cloud-title} on installer-provisioned infrastructure by using an internal mirror of the installation release content. You can use this method to install a cluster that does not require an active internet connection to obtain the software components.
