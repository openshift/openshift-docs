== Choosing a method to install {product-title} on IBM Power Systems

You can install {product-title} on IBM Power Systems by using one of the following deployment methods.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_power/installing-ibm-power.adoc#installing-ibm-power[Installing a cluster on IBM Power Systems]**: You can install {product-title} on IBM Power Systems infrastructure that you provision.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_power/installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power[Installing a cluster on IBM Power Systems in a restricted network]**: You can install {product-title} on IBM Power Systems infrastructure that you provision in a restricted or disconnected network, by using an internal mirror of the installation release content. You can use this method to install a cluster that does not require an active internet connection to obtain the software components. You can also use this installation method to ensure that your clusters only use container images that satisfy your organizational controls on external content.
