= Installing a cluster on {ibm-power-title} in a restricted network
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: installing-restricted-networks-ibm-power

toc::[]

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a cluster on
{ibm-power-name} infrastructure that you provision in a restricted network.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Additional considerations exist for non-bare metal platforms. Review the information in the
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4207611[guidelines for deploying {product-title} on non-tested platforms] before you install an {product-title} cluster.
====

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:../../installing/disconnected_install/installing-mirroring-installation-images.adoc#installing-mirroring-installation-images[created a mirror registry for installation in a restricted network] and obtained the `imageContentSources` data for your version of {product-title}.
* Before you begin the installation process, you must move or remove any existing installation files. This ensures that the required installation files are created and updated during the installation process.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that installation steps are performed on a machine with access to the installation media.
====
* You provisioned xref:../../storage/persistent_storage/persistent-storage-ocs.adoc#persistent-storage-ocs[persistent storage using {rh-storage}] or other supported storage protocols for your cluster. To deploy a private image registry, you must set up persistent storage with `ReadWriteMany` access.
* If you use a firewall and plan to use the Telemetry service, you xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured the firewall to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.
+
[NOTE]
====
Be sure to also review this site list if you are configuring a proxy.

== Requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure

For a cluster that contains user-provisioned infrastructure, you must deploy all
of the required machines.

This section describes the requirements for deploying {product-title} on user-provisioned infrastructure.

== Installing {op-system} and starting the {product-title} bootstrap process

To install {product-title} on {ibm-power-name} infrastructure that you provision, you must install {op-system-first} on the machines. When you install {op-system}, you must provide the Ignition config file that was generated by the {product-title} installation program for the type of machine you are installing. If you have configured suitable networking, DNS, and load balancing infrastructure, the {product-title} bootstrap process begins automatically after the {op-system} machines have rebooted.

Follow either the steps to use an ISO image or network PXE booting to install {op-system} on the machines.
