You can install {product-title-short} on your secured clusters by using the Operator.

:FeatureName: {product-title-short}
include::snippets/field-trial.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

Ensure that you have performed the following steps:

* Created your {ocp} cluster and installed the Operator on it.
* In the ACS Console in {product-title-short}, you have created and downloaded the init bundle.
* You applied the init bundle by using the `oc create` command.
* During installation, you noted the *Central API Endpoint*, including the address and the port number. You can view this information by choosing *Advanced Cluster Security* -> *ACS Instances* from the cloud console navigation menu, and then clicking the ACS instance you created.

You can install {product-title-short} on your secured clusters by using one of the following methods:

* By using the Operator
* By using Helm charts
* By using the `roxctl` CLI (do not use this method unless you have a specific installation need that requires using it)

== Installing {product-title-short} on secured clusters by using Helm charts

=== Configuring the secured-cluster-services Helm chart with customizations

You can use Helm chart configuration parameters with the `helm install` and `helm upgrade` commands.
Specify these parameters by using the `--set` option or by creating YAML configuration files.

Create the following files for configuring the Helm chart for installing {product-title}:

* Public configuration file `values-public.yaml`: Use this file to save all non-sensitive configuration options.
* Private configuration file `values-private.yaml`: Use this file to save all sensitive configuration options. Ensure that you store this file securely.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using the `secured-cluster-services` Helm chart, do not change the `values.yaml` file that is part of the chart.
