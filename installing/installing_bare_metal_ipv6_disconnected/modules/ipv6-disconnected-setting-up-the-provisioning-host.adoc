= Setting up the provisioning host

The provisioning host deploys OpenShift, which requires a cluster, before a cluster can be expanded to the real
cluster master instances.
The role of the provisioning host is to launch the installer and bring up a VM called bootstrap that starts up
temporary cluster resources.

In our case, the provisioning host will be `worker-0` to avoid problems.
