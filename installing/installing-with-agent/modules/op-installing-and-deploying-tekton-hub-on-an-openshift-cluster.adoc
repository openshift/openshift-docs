= Installing and deploying {tekton-hub} on a {product-title} cluster

[role="_abstract"]
{tekton-hub} is an optional component; cluster administrators cannot install it using the `TektonConfig` custom resource (CR). To install and manage {tekton-hub}, use the `TektonHub` CR.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using Github Enterprise or Gitlab Enterprise, install and deploy {tekton-hub} in the same network as the enterprise server. For example, if the enterprise server is running behind a VPN, deploy {tekton-hub} on a cluster that is also behind the VPN.

.Prerequisites
* Ensure that the {pipelines-title} Operator is installed in the default `openshift-pipelines` namespace on the cluster.

.Procedure

. Create a fork of the link:https://github.com/tektoncd/hub[Tekton Hub] repository.

. Clone the forked repository. 

. Update the `config.yaml` file to include at least one user with the following scopes:
* A user with `agent:create` scope who can set up a cron job that refreshes the {tekton-hub} database after an interval, if there are any changes in the catalog.
* A user with the `catalog:refresh` scope who can refresh the catalog and all resources in the database of the {tekton-hub}.
* A user with the `config:refresh` scope who can get additional scopes.

scopes:
- name: agent:create
  users: <username_registered_with_the_Git_repository_hosting_service_provider>
- name: catalog:refresh
  users: <username_registered_with_the_Git_repository_hosting_service_provider>
- name: config:refresh
  users: <username_registered_with_the_Git_repository_hosting_service_provider>
...
----
+
The supported service providers are GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket.

. Create an OAuth application with your Git repository hosting provider, and note the Client ID and Client Secret. 
* For a GitHub OAuth application, set the `Homepage URL` and the `Authorization callback URL` as `<auth-route>`.
* For a GitLab OAuth application, set the `REDIRECT_URI` as `<auth-route>/auth/gitlab/callback`.
* For a BitBucket OAuth application, set the `Callback URL` as `<auth-route>`.

. Edit the following fields in the `<tekton_hub_repository>/config/02-api/20-api-secret.yaml` file for the {tekton-hub} API secret:
* `GH_CLIENT_ID`: The Client ID from the OAuth application created with the Git repository hosting service provider.
* `GH_CLIENT_SECRET`: The Client Secret from the OAuth application created with the Git repository hosting service provider.
* `GHE_URL`: GitHub Enterprise URL, if you are authenticating using GitHub Enterprise. Do not provide the URL to the catalog as a value for this field.
* `GL_CLIENT_ID`: The Client ID from the GitLab OAuth application.
* `GL_CLIENT_SECRET`: The Client Secret from the GitLab OAuth application.
*  `GLE_URL`: GitLab Enterprise URL, if you are authenticating using GitLab Enterprise. Do not provide the URL to the catalog as a value for this field.
* `BB_CLIENT_ID`: The Client ID from the BitBucket OAuth application.
* `BB_CLIENT_SECRET`: The Client Secret from the BitBucket OAuth application.
* `JWT_SIGNING_KEY`: A long, random string used to sign the JSON Web Token (JWT) created for users.
* `ACCESS_JWT_EXPIRES_IN`: Add the time limit after which the access token expires. For example, `1m`, where `m` denotes minutes. The supported units of time are seconds (`s`), minutes (`m`), hours (`h`), days (`d`), and weeks (`w`).
* `REFRESH_JWT_EXPIRES_IN`: Add the time limit after which the refresh token expires. For example, `1m`, where `m` denotes minutes. The supported units of time are seconds (`s`), minutes (`m`), hours (`h`), days (`d`), and weeks (`w`). Ensure that the expiry time set for token refresh is greater than the expiry time set for token access.
* `AUTH_BASE_URL`: Route URL for the OAuth application.
+
[NOTE]
====
* Use the fields related to Client ID and Client Secret for any one of the supported Git repository hosting service providers.
* The account credentials registered with the Git repository hosting service provider enables the users with `catalog: refresh` scope to authenticate and load all catalog resources to the database. 
==== 

. Commit and push the changes to your forked repository.

. Ensure that the `TektonHub` CR is similar to the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: TektonHub
metadata:
  name: hub
spec:
  targetNamespace: openshift-pipelines <1>

----
<1> The namespace in which Tekton Hub must be installed; default is `openshift-pipelines`.
<2> Substitute with the URL of the `config.yaml` file of your forked repository.

. Install the {tekton-hub}.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f TektonHub.yaml <1>
----
<1> The file name or path of the `TektonConfig` CR.

. Check the status of the installation.
