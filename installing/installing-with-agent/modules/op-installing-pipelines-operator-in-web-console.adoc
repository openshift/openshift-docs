= Installing the {pipelines-title} Operator in web console

You can install {pipelines-title} using the Operator listed in the {product-title} OperatorHub. When you install the {pipelines-title} Operator, the custom resources (CRs) required for the pipelines configuration are automatically installed along with the Operator.

The default Operator custom resource definition (CRD) `config.operator.tekton.dev` is now replaced by `tektonconfigs.operator.tekton.dev`.  In addition, the Operator provides the following additional CRDs to individually manage OpenShift Pipelines components:
 `tektonpipelines.operator.tekton.dev`, `tektontriggers.operator.tekton.dev` and `tektonaddons.operator.tekton.dev`.

If you have OpenShift Pipelines already installed on your cluster, the existing installation is seamlessly upgraded. The Operator will replace the instance of `config.operator.tekton.dev` on your cluster with an instance of `tektonconfigs.operator.tekton.dev` and additional objects of the other CRDs as necessary.

[WARNING]
====
If you manually changed your existing installation, such as, changing the target namespace in the `config.operator.tekton.dev` CRD instance by making changes to the `resource name - cluster` field, then the upgrade path is not smooth. In such cases, the recommended workflow is to uninstall your installation and reinstall the {pipelines-title} Operator.
====

The {pipelines-title} Operator now provides the option to choose the components that you want to install by specifying profiles as part of the `TektonConfig` CR. The `TektonConfig` CR is automatically installed when the Operator is installed.
The supported profiles are:

* Lite: This installs only Tekton Pipelines.
* Basic: This installs Tekton Pipelines and Tekton Triggers.
* All: This is the default profile used when the `TektonConfig` CR is installed. This profile installs all of the Tekton components: Tekton Pipelines, Tekton Triggers, Tekton Addons (which include `ClusterTasks`, `ClusterTriggerBindings`, `ConsoleCLIDownload`, `ConsoleQuickStart` and `ConsoleYAMLSample` resources).

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, navigate to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

. Use the *Filter by keyword* box to search for `{pipelines-title}` Operator in the catalog. Click the *{pipelines-title}* Operator tile.

. Read the brief description about the Operator on the *{pipelines-title}* Operator page. Click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page:
+
.. Select *All namespaces on the cluster (default)* for the *Installation Mode*. This mode installs the Operator in the default `openshift-operators` namespace, which enables the Operator to watch and be made available to all namespaces in the cluster.

.. Select *Automatic* for the *Approval Strategy*. This ensures that the future upgrades to the Operator are handled automatically by the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). If you select the *Manual* approval strategy, OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve the OLM update request to update the Operator to the new version.

.. Select an *Update Channel*.

*** The `pipelines-<version>` channel is the default channel to install the {pipelines-title} Operator. For example, the default channel to install the {pipelines-title} Operator version `1.7` is `pipelines-1.7`.
*** The `latest` channel enables installation of the most recent stable version of the {pipelines-title} Operator. 
+
[NOTE]
====
The `preview` and `stable` channels will be deprecated and removed in a future release.
====  

. Click *Install*. You will see the Operator listed on the *Installed Operators* page.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Operator is installed automatically into the `openshift-operators` namespace.
====
+
. Verify that the *Status* is set to *Succeeded Up to date*  to confirm successful installation of {pipelines-title} Operator.
