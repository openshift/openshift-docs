= Custom Helm reconciler configurations using provided library APIs

A disadvantage of existing Helm-based Operators is the inability to configure the Helm reconciler, because it is abstracted from users. For a Helm-based Operator to reach the Seamless Upgrades capability (level II and later) that reuses an already existing Helm chart, a hybrid between the Go and Helm Operator types adds value.

The APIs provided in the link:https://github.com/operator-framework/helm-operator-plugins[`helm-operator-plugins`] library allow Operator authors to make the following configurations:

* Customize value mapping based on cluster state
* Execute code in specific events by configuring the reconciler's event recorder
* Customize the reconciler's logger
* Setup `Install`, `Upgrade`, and `Uninstall` annotations to enable Helm's actions to be configured based on the annotations found in custom resources watched by the reconciler
* Configure the reconciler to run with `Pre` and `Post` hooks

The above configurations to the reconciler can be done in the `main.go` file:

// Operator's main.go
// With the help of helpers provided in the library, the reconciler can be
// configured here before starting the controller with this reconciler.
reconciler := reconciler.New(
 reconciler.WithChart(*chart),
 reconciler.WithGroupVersionKind(gvk),
)

if err := reconciler.SetupWithManager(mgr); err != nil {
 panic(fmt.Sprintf("unable to create reconciler: %s", err))
}
