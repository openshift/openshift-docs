= The 3scale WebAssembly module mapping_rule object

The `mapping_rule` object is part of an array in the `mapping_rules` object.

The `mapping_rule` object fields specify the following information:

* The _HTTP request method_ to match.
* A pattern to match the path against.
* The 3scale methods to report along with the amount to report. The order in which you specify the fields determines the evaluation order.

.`mapping_rule` object fields
|===
|Name |Description |Required

a|`method`
|Specifies a string representing an HTTP request method, also known as verb. Values accepted match the any one of the accepted HTTP method names, case-insensitive. A special value of any matches any method.
|Yes

a|`pattern`
a|The pattern to match the HTTP request's URI path component. This pattern follows the same syntax as documented by 3scale. It allows wildcards (use of the asterisk (*) character) using any sequence of characters between braces such as `{this}`.
|Yes

a|`usages`
a|A list of `usage` objects. When the rule matches, all methods with their `deltas` are added to the list of methods sent to 3scale for authorization and reporting.

Embed the `usages` object with the following required fields:

* `name`: The `method` system name to report.
* `delta`: For how much to increase that `method` by.
|Yes

a|`last`
|Whether the successful matching of this rule should stop the evaluation of more mapping rules.
a|Optional Boolean. The default is `false`
|===


The following example is independent of existing hierarchies between methods in 3scale. That is, anything run on the 3scale side will not affect this. For example, the _Hits_ metric might be a parent of them all, so it stores 4 hits due to the sum of all reported methods in the authorized request and calls the 3scale `Authrep` API endpoint.

The example below uses a `GET` request to a path, `/products/1/sold`, that matches all the rules.

.`mapping_rules` `GET` request example
[source,yaml]

apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshExtension
metadata:
  name: threescale-wasm-auth
spec:
  config:
    ...
    mapping_rules:
      - method: GET
        pattern: /
        usages:
          - name: hits
            delta: 1
      - method: GET
        pattern: /products/
        usages:
          - name: products
            delta: 1
      - method: ANY
        pattern: /products/{id}/sold
        usages:
          - name: sales
            delta: 1
          - name: products
            delta: 1
    ...

All `usages` get added to the request the module performs to 3scale with usage data as follows:

* Hits: 1
* products: 2
* sales: 1
