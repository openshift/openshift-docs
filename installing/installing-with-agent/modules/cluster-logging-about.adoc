= About deploying the {logging-title}

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin[]
{product-title} cluster administrators can deploy the {logging} using
the {product-title} web console or CLI to install the OpenShift Elasticsearch
Operator and Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator. When the operators are installed, you create
a `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR) to schedule {logging} pods and
other resources necessary to support the {logging}. The operators are
responsible for deploying, upgrading, and maintaining the {logging}.
endif::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin[]

The `ClusterLogging` CR defines a complete {logging} environment that includes all the components
of the logging stack to collect, store and visualize logs. The Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator watches the {logging} CR and adjusts the logging deployment accordingly.

Administrators and application developers can view the logs of the projects for which they have view access.
