= Querying metrics

The OpenShift monitoring dashboard lets you run Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) queries to examine metrics visualized on a plot. This functionality provides information about the state of a cluster and any user-defined projects that you are monitoring.

As a `dedicated-admin`, you can query one or more namespaces at a time for metrics about user-defined projects.

As a developer, you must specify a project name when querying metrics. You must have the required privileges to view metrics for the selected project.
