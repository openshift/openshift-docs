= Deleting AWS resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

To clean up resources after uninstalling an {product-title} cluster with the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) in manual mode with STS, you can use the CCO utility (`ccoctl`) to remove the AWS resources that `ccoctl` created during installation.

= Deleting GCP resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

To clean up resources after uninstalling an {product-title} cluster with the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) in manual mode with GCP Workload Identity, you can use the CCO utility (`ccoctl`) to remove the GCP resources that `ccoctl` created during installation.

.Prerequisites

* Extract and prepare the `ccoctl` binary.
ifdef::aws-sts[]
* Install an {product-title} cluster with the CCO in manual mode with STS.

ifdef::google-cloud-platform[]
* Install an {product-title} cluster with the CCO in manual mode with GCP Workload Identity.
endif::google-cloud-platform[]

.Procedure

ifdef::aws-sts[]
* Delete the AWS resources that `ccoctl` created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ccoctl aws delete --name=<name> --region=<aws_region>
----
+
where:
+
** `<name>` matches the name used to originally create and tag the cloud resources.
** `<aws_region>` is the AWS region in which cloud resources will be deleted.
endif::aws-sts[]
ifdef::google-cloud-platform[]
* Delete the GCP resources that `ccoctl` created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ccoctl gcp delete --name=<name> --project=<gcp_project_id>
----
+
where:
+
** `<name>` matches the name used to originally create and tag the cloud resources.
** `<gcp_project_id>` is the GCP project ID in which cloud resources will be deleted.
endif::google-cloud-platform[]
