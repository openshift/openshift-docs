= Troubleshooting throughput issues
Sometimes applications deployed through {product-title} can cause
network throughput issues such as unusually high latency between
specific services.

Use the following methods to analyze performance issues if pod logs do not
reveal any cause of the problem:

* Use a packet analyzer, such as ping or link:http://www.tcpdump.org/[tcpdump]
to analyze traffic between a pod and its node.
+
For example, run the tcpdump tool on each pod while reproducing the behavior
that led to the issue.
Review the captures on both sides to compare send and receive timestamps to
analyze the latency of traffic to and from a pod.
Latency can occur in {product-title} if a node interface is overloaded with
traffic from other pods, storage devices, or the data plane.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ tcpdump -s 0 -i any -w /tmp/dump.pcap host <podip 1> && host <podip 2> <1>
----
+
<1> `podip` is the IP address for the pod. Run the `oc get pod <pod_name> -o wide` command to get
the IP address of a pod.
+
tcpdump generates a file at `/tmp/dump.pcap` containing all traffic between
these two pods. Ideally, run the analyzer shortly
before the issue is reproduced and stop the analyzer shortly after the issue
is finished reproducing to minimize the size of the file.
You can also run a packet analyzer between the nodes (eliminating the SDN from
  the equation) with:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ tcpdump -s 0 -i any -w /tmp/dump.pcap port 4789
----

* Use a bandwidth measuring tool, such as iperf, to measure streaming throughput
and UDP throughput. Run the tool from the pods first, then from the nodes,
to locate any bottlenecks.
