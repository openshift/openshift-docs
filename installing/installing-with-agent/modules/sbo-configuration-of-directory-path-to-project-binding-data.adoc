= Configuration of the directory path to project the binding data inside workload container

By default, {servicebinding-title} mounts the binding data as files at a specific directory in your workload resource. You can configure the directory path using the `SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT` environment variable setup in the container where your workload runs.

.Example: Binding data mounted as files
----
$SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT <1>
├── account-database <2>
│   ├── type <3>
│   ├── provider <4>
│   ├── uri
│   ├── username
│   └── password
└── transaction-event-stream <2>
    ├── type
    ├── connection-count
    ├── uri
    ├── certificates
    └── private-key
----
<1> Root directory.
<2> Directory that stores the binding data.
<3> Mandatory identifier that identifies the type of the binding data projected into the corresponding directory.
<4> Optional: Identifier to identify the provider so that the application can identify the type of backing service it can connect to.

To consume the binding data as environment variables, use the built-in language feature of your programming language of choice that can read environment variables.

.Example: Python client usage
----
import os
username = os.getenv("USERNAME")
password = os.getenv("PASSWORD")
----

== Computation of the final path for projecting the binding data as files

The following table summarizes the configuration of how the final path for the binding data projection is computed when files are mounted at a specific directory:

.Summary of the final path computation
[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
| `SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT` | Final path

| Not available
| `/bindings/<ServiceBinding_ResourceName>`

| `dir/path/root`
| `dir/path/root/<ServiceBinding_ResourceName>`
|===

In the previous table, the `<ServiceBinding_ResourceName>` entry specifies the name of the `ServiceBinding` resource that you configure in the `.metadata.name` section of the custom resource (CR).

To access and consume the binding data within the existing `SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT` environment variable, use the built-in language feature of your programming language of choice that can read environment variables.

.Example: Python client usage
----
from pyservicebinding import binding
try:
    sb = binding.ServiceBinding()
except binding.ServiceBindingRootMissingError as msg:
    # log the error message and retry/exit
    print("SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT env var not set")
sb = binding.ServiceBinding()
bindings_list = sb.bindings("postgresql")
----

In the previous example, the `bindings_list` variable contains the binding data for the `postgresql` database service type.
