= Disabling automatic creation of routes

By default, the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource automatically synchronizes the Gateway resources with OpenShift routes. Disabling the automatic route creation allows you more flexibility to control routes if you have a special case or prefer to control routes manually.

Disable integration between Istio Gateways and OpenShift Routes by setting the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` field `gateways.openshiftRoute.enabled` to `false`. For example, see the following resource snippet.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  gateways:
    openshiftRoute:
      enabled: false
----
