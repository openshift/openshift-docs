= Collecting {sandboxed-containers-first} data for Red Hat Support

When opening a support case, it is helpful to provide debugging information about your cluster to Red Hat Support.

The `must-gather` tool enables you to collect diagnostic information about your {product-title} cluster, including virtual machines and other data related to {sandboxed-containers-first}.

For prompt support, supply diagnostic information for both {product-title} and {sandboxed-containers-first}.
