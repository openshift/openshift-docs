= Creating restore hooks

You create restore hooks to run commands in a container in a pod while restoring your application by editing the `Restore` custom resource (CR).

You can create two types of restore hooks:

* An `init` hook adds an init container to a pod to perform setup tasks before the application container starts.
+
If you restore a Restic backup, the `restic-wait` init container is added before the restore hook init container.

* An `exec` hook runs commands or scripts in a container of a restored pod.

.Procedure

* Add a hook to the `spec.hooks` block of the `Restore` CR, as in the following example:

<1> Optional: Array of namespaces to which the hook applies. If this value is not specified, the hook applies to all namespaces.
<2> Currently, pods are the only supported resource.
<3> Optional: This hook only applies to objects matching the label selector.
<4> Optional: If the container is not specified, the command runs in the first container in the pod.
<5> Array of commands that the hook runs.
<6> Optional: If the `waitTimeout` is not specified, the restore waits indefinitely. You can specify how long to wait for a container to start and for preceding hooks in the container to complete. The wait timeout starts when the container is restored and might require time for the container to pull the image and mount the volumes.
<7> Optional: How long to wait for the commands to run. The default is `30s`.
<8> Allowed values for error handling are `Fail` and `Continue`:
** `Continue`: Only command failures are logged.
** `Fail`: No more restore hooks run in any container in any pod. The status of the `Restore` CR will be `PartiallyFailed`.
