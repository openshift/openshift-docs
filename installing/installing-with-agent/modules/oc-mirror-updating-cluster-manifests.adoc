= Installing the ImageContentSourcePolicy and CatalogSource resources into the cluster

// TODO: Can we find a better title / more generic than calling out the two resources?

After you have mirrored your image set to the mirror registry, you must install the generated `ImageContentSourcePolicy` and `CatalogSource` resources into the cluster.

The `ImageContentSourcePolicy` resource associates the mirror registry with the source registry and redirects image pull requests from the online registries to the mirror registry. The `CatalogSource` resource is used by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to retrieve information about the available Operators in the mirror registry.

.Prerequisites

* You have mirrored the image set to the registry mirror in the disconnected environment.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Log in to the OpenShift CLI as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

. Apply the YAML files from the results directory to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f ./oc-mirror-workspace/results-1639608409/
----

// TODO: Any example output to show?

.Verification

. Verify that the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` resources were successfully installed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get imagecontentsourcepolicy --all-namespaces
----

. Verify that the `CatalogSource` resources were successfully installed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get catalogsource --all-namespaces
----
