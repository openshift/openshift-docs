[id="ossm-threescale-webassembly-module-credentials-object_{context}"]
= The 3scale WebAssembly module credentials object

The `credentials` object is a component of the `service` object. `credentials` specifies which kind of credentials to be looked up and the steps to perform this action.

All fields are optional, but you must specify at least one, `user_key` or `app_id`. The order in which you specify each credential is irrelevant because it is pre-established by the module. Only specify one instance of each credential.

.`credentials` object fields
|===
|Name |Description |Required

a|`user_key`
|This is an array of lookup queries that defines a 3scale user key. A user key is commonly known as an API key.
|Optional

a|`app_id`
a|This is an array of lookup queries that define a 3scale application identifier. Application identifiers are provided by 3scale or by using an identity provider like link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on[Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SS0)], or OpenID Connect (OIDC). The resolution of the lookup queries specified here, whenever it is successful and resolves to two values, it sets up the `app_id` and the `app_key`.
|Optional

a|`app_key`
a|This is an array of lookup queries that define a 3scale application key. Application keys without a resolved `app_id` are useless, so only specify this field when `app_id` has been specified.
|Optional
