= Creating `SharedVolume` resources using the CLI

You must create one `SharedVolume` resource per file system:access point pair in each project from which you want pods to access it. You can create a SharedVolume manually by entering YAML or JSON definitions, or by dragging and dropping a file into an editor.

.Procedure

. Using the `oc` CLI, create the YAML file using the `accessPointID` and `fileSystemID` values from the EFS resources you created earlier.
+
[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: aws-efs.managed.openshift.io/v1alpha1
  kind: SharedVolume
  metadata:
    name: sv1
    namespace: efsop2
  spec:
    accessPointID: fsap-0123456789abcdef
    fileSystemID: fs-0123cdef
----

. Apply the file to the cluster using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
----
+
The `SharedVolume` resource is created, and triggers the AWS EFS Operator to generate and associate a PersistentVolume:PersistentVolumeClaim pair with the specified EFS access point.

. To verify that the PVC exists and is bound, navigate to *Storage* > *Persistent Volume Claims*.
+
The PVC name is `pvc-{shared_volume_name}`. The associated PV name is `pv-{project_name}-{shared_volume_name}`.
