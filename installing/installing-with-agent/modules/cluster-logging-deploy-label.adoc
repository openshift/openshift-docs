= Labeling nodes

At 100 nodes or more, pre-pull the logging images from the registry. After deploying the logging pods, such as Elasticsearch and Kibana, node labeling should be done in steps of 20 nodes at a time. For example:

Using a simple loop:

[source,terminal]
----
$ while read node; do oc label nodes $node elasticsearch-fluentd=true; done < 20_fluentd.lst
----

The following also works:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label nodes 10.10.0.{100..119} elasticsearch-fluentd=true
----

Labeling nodes in groups paces the daemon sets used by the {logging}, helping to avoid contention on shared resources such as the image registry.

====
Check for the occurrence of any "CrashLoopBackOff | ImagePullFailed | Error" issues.
`oc logs <pod>`, `oc describe pod <pod>` and `oc get event` are helpful diagnostic commands.
