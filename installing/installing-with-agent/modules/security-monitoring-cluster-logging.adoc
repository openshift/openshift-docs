Using the `oc log` command, you can view container logs, build configs and
deployments in real time. Different can users have access different
access to logs:

* Users who have access to a project are able to see the logs for that project by default.
* Users with admin roles can access all container logs.

To save your logs for further audit and analysis, you can enable the `cluster-logging` add-on
feature to collect, manage, and view system, container, and audit logs.
You can deploy, manage, and upgrade OpenShift Logging through the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator
and Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator.
