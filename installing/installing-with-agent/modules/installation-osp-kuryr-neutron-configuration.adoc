= Configuring Neutron

Kuryr CNI leverages the Neutron Trunks extension to plug containers into the
{rh-openstack-first} SDN, so you must use the `trunks` extension for Kuryr to properly work.

In addition, if you leverage the default ML2/OVS Neutron driver, the firewall
must be set to `openvswitch` instead of `ovs_hybrid` so that security groups are
enforced on trunk subports and Kuryr can properly handle network policies.
