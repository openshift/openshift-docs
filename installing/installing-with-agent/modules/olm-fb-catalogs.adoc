= File-based catalogs

_File-based catalogs_ are the latest iteration of the catalog format in Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). It is a plain text-based (JSON or YAML) and declarative config evolution of the earlier SQLite database format, and it is fully backwards compatible. The goal of this format is to enable Operator catalog editing, composability, and extensibility.

[NOTE]
====
The default Red Hat-provided Operator catalogs for {product-title} 4.6 and later are currently still shipped in the SQLite database format.
====

Editing::
With file-based catalogs, users interacting with the contents of a catalog are able to make direct changes to the format and verify that their changes are valid. Because this format is plain text JSON or YAML, catalog maintainers can easily manipulate catalog metadata by hand or with widely known and supported JSON or YAML tooling, such as the `jq` CLI.
+
This editability enables the following features and user-defined extensions:
+
--
* Promoting an existing bundle to a new channel
* Changing the default channel of a package
* Custom algorithms for adding, updating, and removing upgrade edges
--

Composability::
File-based catalogs are stored in an arbitrary directory hierarchy, which enables catalog composition. For example, consider two separate file-based catalog directories: `catalogA` and `catalogB`. A catalog maintainer can create a new combined catalog by making a new directory `catalogC` and copying `catalogA` and `catalogB` into it.
+
This composability enables decentralized catalogs. The format permits Operator authors to maintain Operator-specific catalogs, and it permits maintainers to trivially build a catalog composed of individual Operator catalogs. File-based catalogs can be composed by combining multiple other catalogs, by extracting subsets of one catalog, or a combination of both of these.
+
[NOTE]
====
Duplicate packages and duplicate bundles within a package are not permitted. The `opm validate` command returns an error if any duplicates are found.
====
+
Because Operator authors are most familiar with their Operator, its dependencies, and its upgrade compatibility, they are able to maintain their own Operator-specific catalog and have direct control over its contents. With file-based catalogs, Operator authors own the task of building and maintaining their packages in a catalog. Composite catalog maintainers, however, only own the task of curating the packages in their catalog and publishing the catalog to users.

Extensibility::
The file-based catalog specification is a low-level representation of a catalog. While it can be maintained directly in its low-level form, catalog maintainers can build interesting extensions on top that can be used by their own custom tooling to make any number of mutations.
+
For example, a tool could translate a high-level API, such as `(mode=semver)`, down to the low-level, file-based catalog format for upgrade edges. Or a catalog maintainer might need to customize all of the bundle metadata by adding a new property to bundles that meet a certain criteria.
+
While this extensibility allows for additional official tooling to be developed on top of the low-level APIs for future {product-title} releases, the major benefit is that catalog maintainers have this capability as well.
