= Signing secrets in {tekton-chains}

[role="_abstract"]
Cluster administrators can generate a key pair and use {tekton-chains} to sign artifacts using a Kubernetes secret. For {tekton-chains} to work, a private key and a password for encrypted keys must exist as part of the `signing-secrets` Kubernetes secret, in the `openshift-pipelines` namespace.

Currently, {tekton-chains} supports the `x509` and `cosign` signature schemes.

[NOTE]
====
Use only one of the supported signature schemes.

[id="chains-signing-secrets-x509_{context}"]
== Signing using x509

To use the `x509` signing scheme with {tekton-chains}, store the `x509.pem` private key of the `ed25519` or `ecdsa` type in the `signing-secrets` Kubernetes secret. Ensure that the key is stored as an unencrypted PKCS8 PEM file (`BEGIN PRIVATE KEY`).

[id="chains-signing-secrets-cosign_{context}"]
== Signing using cosign

To use the `cosign` signing scheme with {tekton-chains}:

. Install link:https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/installation/[cosign].

. Generate the `cosign.key` and `cosign.pub` key pairs.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cosign generate-key-pair k8s://openshift-pipelines/signing-secrets
----
+
Cosign prompts you for a password, and creates a Kubernetes secret.

. Store the encrypted `cosign.key` private key and the `cosign.password` decryption password in the `signing-secrets` Kubernetes secret. Ensure that the private key is stored as an encrypted PEM file of the `ENCRYPTED COSIGN PRIVATE KEY` type.

[id="chains-troubleshooting-signing_{context}"]
== Troubleshooting signing

If the signing secrets are already populated, you might get the following error:

[source,yaml]
----
Error from server (AlreadyExists): secrets "signing-secrets" already exists
----

To resolve the error:

. Delete the secrets:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete secret signing-secrets -n openshift-pipelines
----

. Recreate the key pairs and store them in the secrets using your preferred signing scheme.
