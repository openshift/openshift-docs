== Fixed issues

The following issue has been resolved in the current release:

* {gitops-title} Operator v1.4.0 introduced a regression which removes the description fields from `spec` for the following CRDs:

** `argoproj.io_applications.yaml`
** `argoproj.io_appprojects.yaml`
** `argoproj.io_argocds.yaml`
+
Before this update, when you created an `AppProject` resource using the `oc create` command, the resource failed to synchronize due to the missing description fields. This update restores the missing description fields in the preceding CRDs.  link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-1721[GITOPS-1721]
