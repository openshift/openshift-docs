= Limitations for multi-tenant Operator management

{product-title} provides limited support for simultaneously installing different variations of an Operator on a cluster. Operators are control plane extensions. All tenants, or namespaces, share the same control plane of a cluster. Therefore, tenants in a multi-tenant environment also have to share Operators.

The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) installs Operators multiple times in different namespaces. One constraint of this is that the Operatorâ€™s API versions must be the same.

Different major versions of an Operator often have incompatible custom resource definitions (CRDs). This makes it difficult to quickly verify OLMs.
