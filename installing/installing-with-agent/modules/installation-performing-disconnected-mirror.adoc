= Mirroring the {product-title} image registry contents to disk for use in disconnected environments

When you mirror images to disk, you download images as files. Then, you move your
mirror host, which can be a laptop or a removable media device, like a
USB drive, into the restricted network and complete the mirror
procedure.

.Procedure

. On a local host, test the mirror process:
+
----
$ oc adm release mirror <product_version> --to <mirror_repository> --dry-run
----

. On a local host, copy the required `imageContentSources` and `ImageContentSourcePolicy`:
.. Make the mirror directory and change to it:
+
----
$ mkdir <mirror_dir> ; cd <mirror_dir>
----

.. Mirror the images:
+
----
$ oc adm release mirror <product_version> --to file://openshift/release
----

. From within the restricted network, mirror the images to your restricted mirror repository:
+
----
$ oc adm release mirror file://openshift/release:<product_version>* --to <mirror_repository>
----
