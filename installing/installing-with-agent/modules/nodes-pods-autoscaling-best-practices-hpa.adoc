.All pods must have resource requests configured
The HPA makes a scaling decision based on the observed CPU or memory utilization values of pods in an {product-title} cluster. Utilization values are calculated as a percentage of the resource requests of each pod.
Missing resource request values can affect the optimal performance of the HPA.

.Configure the cool down period
During horizontal pod autoscaling, there might be a rapid scaling of events without a time gap. Configure the cool down period to prevent frequent replica fluctuations.
You can specify a cool down period by configuring the `stabilizationWindowSeconds` field. The stabilization window is used to restrict the fluctuation of replicas count when the metrics used for scaling keep fluctuating.
The autoscaling algorithm uses this window to infer a previous desired state and avoid unwanted changes to workload scale.

For example, a stabilization window is specified for the `scaleDown` field:

[source,yaml]
----
behavior:
  scaleDown:
    stabilizationWindowSeconds: 300
----

In the above example, all desired states for the past 5 minutes are considered. This approximates a rolling maximum, and avoids having the scaling algorithm frequently remove pods only to trigger recreating an equivalent pod just moments later.
