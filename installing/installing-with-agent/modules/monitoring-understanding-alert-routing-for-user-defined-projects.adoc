= Understanding alert routing for user-defined projects

[role="_abstract"]
As a cluster administrator, you can enable alert routing for user-defined projects. After doing so, you can allow users to configure alert routing for their user-defined projects. Users can then create and configure user-defined alert routing by creating or editing the `AlertmanagerConfig` objects.

After a user has defined alert routing for a user-defined project, user-defined alerts are routed to the `alertmanager-main` pods in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace. 

Note the following limitations and features of alert routing for user-defined projects:

* For user-defined alerting rules, user-defined routing is scoped to the namespace in which the resource is defined.
For example, a routing configuration in namespace `ns1` only applies to `PrometheusRules` resources in the same namespace.

* The Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) does not deploy a second Alertmanager service dedicated to user-defined alerts.
Cluster administrators continue to define the main Alertmanager configuration by using a custom secret or the {product-title} web console. 

* When a namespace is excluded from user-defined monitoring, `AlertmanagerConfig` resources in the namespace cease to be part of the Alertmanager configuration.
