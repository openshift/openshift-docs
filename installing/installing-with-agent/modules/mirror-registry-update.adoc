[NOTE]
====
* Users who upgrade the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ with the `./mirror-registry upgrade` flag must include the same credentials used when creating their mirror registry. For example, if you installed the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ with `--quayHostname <host_example_com>` and `--quayRoot <example_directory_name>`, you must include that string to properly upgrade the mirror registry.
