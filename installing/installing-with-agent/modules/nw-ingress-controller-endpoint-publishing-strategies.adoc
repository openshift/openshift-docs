*`NodePortService` endpoint publishing strategy*

The `NodePortService` endpoint publishing strategy publishes the Ingress Controller using a Kubernetes NodePort service.

In this configuration, the Ingress Controller deployment uses container networking. A `NodePortService` is created to publish the deployment. The specific node ports are dynamically allocated by {product-title}; however, to support static port allocations, your changes to the node port field of the managed `NodePortService` are preserved.

The preceding graphic shows the following concepts pertaining to {product-title} Ingress NodePort endpoint publishing strategy:

* All the available nodes in the cluster have their own, externally accessible IP addresses. The service running in the cluster is bound to the unique NodePort for all the nodes.
* When the client connects to a node that is down, for example, by connecting the `10.0.128.4` IP address in the graphic, the node port directly connects the client to an available node that is running the service. In this scenario, no load balancing is required. As the image shows, the `10.0.128.4` address is down and another IP address must be used instead.

[NOTE]
====
The Ingress Operator ignores any updates to `.spec.ports[].nodePort` fields of the service.

By default, ports are allocated automatically and you can access the port allocations for integrations. However, sometimes static port allocations are necessary to integrate with existing infrastructure which may not be easily reconfigured in response to dynamic ports. To achieve integrations with static node ports, you can update the managed service resource directly.

*`HostNetwork` endpoint publishing strategy*

The `HostNetwork` endpoint publishing strategy publishes the Ingress Controller on node ports where the Ingress Controller is deployed.

An Ingress Controller with the `HostNetwork` endpoint publishing strategy can have only one pod replica per node. If you want _n_ replicas, you must use at least _n_ nodes where those replicas can be scheduled. Because each pod replica requests ports `80` and `443` on the node host where it is scheduled, a replica cannot be scheduled to a node if another pod on the same node is using those ports.
