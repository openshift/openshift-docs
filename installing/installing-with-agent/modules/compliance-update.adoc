= Updating security content

Security content is shipped as container images that the `ProfileBundle` objects refer to. To accurately track updates to `ProfileBundles` and the custom resources parsed from the bundles such as rules or profiles, identify the container image with the compliance content using a digest instead of a tag:

.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
  kind: ProfileBundle
  metadata:
    name: rhcos4
  spec:
    contentImage: quay.io/user/ocp4-openscap-content@sha256:a1749f5150b19a9560a5732fe48a89f07bffc79c0832aa8c49ee5504590ae687 <1>
    contentFile: ssg-rhcos4-ds.xml
----

<1>  Security container image.

Each `ProfileBundle` is backed by a deployment. When the Compliance Operator detects that the container image digest has changed, the deployment is updated to reflect the change and parse the content again. Using the digest instead of a tag ensures that you use a stable and predictable set of profiles.
