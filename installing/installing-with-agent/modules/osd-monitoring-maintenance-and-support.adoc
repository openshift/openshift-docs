= Maintenance and support for monitoring

The supported way of configuring {product-title} Monitoring is by using the options described in this document. *Do not use other configurations, as they are unsupported.*

[IMPORTANT]
====
Installing another Prometheus instance is not supported by the Red Hat Site Reliability Engineers (SREs).
====

Configuration paradigms can change across Prometheus releases, and such cases can only be handled gracefully if all configuration possibilities are controlled. If you use configurations other than those described in this section, your changes will disappear because the `cluster-monitoring-operator` reconciles any differences. The Operator resets everything to the defined state by default and by design.
