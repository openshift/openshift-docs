[id="new-features-1-1_{context}"]
== New features
In addition to the fixes and stability improvements, the following sections highlight what is new in {gitops-title} 1.1:

* The `ApplicationSet` feature is now added (Technology Preview). The `ApplicationSet` feature enables both automation and greater flexibility when managing Argo CD applications across a large number of clusters and within monorepos. It also makes self-service usage possible on multitenant Kubernetes clusters.
* Argo CD is now integrated with cluster logging stack and with the {product-title} Monitoring and Alerting features.
* Argo CD auth is now integrated with {product-title}.
* Argo CD applications controller now supports horizontal scaling.
* Argo CD Redis servers now support high availability (HA).

[id="fixed-issues-1-1_{context}"]
== Fixed issues
The following issues were resolved in the current release:

* Previously, {gitops-title} did not work as expected in a proxy server setup with active global proxy settings. This issue is fixed and now Argo CD is configured by the {gitops-title} Operator using fully qualified domain names (FQDN) for the pods to enable communication between components. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-703[GITOPS-703]
* The {gitops-title} backend relies on the `?ref=` query parameter in the {gitops-title} URL to make API calls. Previously, this parameter was not read from the URL, causing the backend to always consider the default reference. This issue is fixed and the {gitops-title} backend now extracts the reference query parameter from the {gitops-title} URL and only uses the default reference when there is no input reference provided. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-817[GITOPS-817]
* Previously, the {gitops-title} backend failed to find the valid GitLab repository. This was because the {gitops-title} backend checked for `main` as the branch reference, instead of `master` in the GitLab repository. This issue is fixed now. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-768[GITOPS-768]
* The *Environments* page in the *Developer* perspective of the {product-title} web console now shows the list of applications and the number of environments. This page also displays an Argo CD link that directs you to the Argo CD *Applications* page that lists all the applications. The Argo CD *Applications* page has *LABELS* (for example, `app.kubernetes.io/name=appName`) that help you filter only the applications of your choice. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-544[GITOPS-544]


[id="known-issues-1-1_{context}"]
== Known issues
These are the known issues in {gitops-title} 1.1:

* {gitops-title} does not support Helm v2 and ksonnet.
* The Red Hat SSO (RH SSO) Operator is not supported in disconnected clusters. As a result, the {gitops-title} Operator and RH SSO integration is not supported in disconnected clusters.
* When you delete an Argo CD application from the {product-title} web console, the Argo CD application gets deleted in the user interface, but the deployments are still present in the cluster. As a workaround, delete the Argo CD application from the Argo CD console. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-830[GITOPS-830]


[id="breaking-change-1-1_{context}"]
== Breaking Change
=== Upgrading from {gitops-title} v1.0.1

When you upgrade from {gitops-title} `v1.0.1` to `v1.1`, the {gitops-title} Operator renames the default Argo CD instance created in the `openshift-gitops` namespace from `argocd-cluster` to `openshift-gitops`.

This is a breaking change and needs the following steps to be performed manually, before the upgrade:

. Go to the {product-title} web console and copy the content of the `argocd-cm.yml` config map file in the `openshift-gitops` namespace to a local file. The content may look like the following example:
+
.Example argocd config map YAML

<1> Restore only the `data` section of the content in the `argocd-cm.yml` config map file manually.
<2> Replace the URL value in the config map entry with the new instance name `openshift-gitops`.

. Delete the default `argocd-cluster` instance.
. Edit the new `argocd-cm.yml` config map file to restore the entire `data` section manually.
. Replace the URL value in the config map entry with the new instance name `openshift-gitops`. For example, in the preceding example, replace the URL value with the following URL value:
+

. Login to the Argo CD cluster and verify that the previous configurations are present.
