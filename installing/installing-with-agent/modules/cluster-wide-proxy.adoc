= Configuring a cluster-wide proxy during installation

You can add a proxy during cluster installation. Prior to installation, however, you should verify that the proxy is accessible from the intended cluster virtual private cloud (VPC) and its private subnets.

[WARNING]
====
Only cluster system egress traffic is proxied, including calls to the AWS API. A system-wide proxy does not affect user workloads. It only affects system components.

.Procedure
* To create a cluster with a proxy, run the following command:
+
ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create cluster \
 <other_arguments_here> \
 --additional-trust-bundle-file <path_to_CA_bundle_file> \ <1> <2> <3>
 --http-proxy http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> \ <1> <4>
 --https-proxy http(s)://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> <4>
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ ocm create cluster \
 <other_arguments_here> \
 --additional-trust-bundle-file <path_to_CA_bundle_file> \ <1> <2> <3>
 --http-proxy http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> \ <1> <4>
 --https-proxy http(s)://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> <4>
----
endif::[]
+
<1> The `http-proxy`, `https-proxy`, and `additional-trust-bundle-file` arguments are all optional.
<2> If you use the `additional-trust-bundle-file` option without an `http(s)-proxy` argument, the passed additional trust bundle is set on the cluster, but it is not configured to be used with the proxy.
<3> The `additional-trust-bundle-file` argument is a file path pointing to a bundle of PEM-encoded X.509 certificates, which are all concatenated together. The `additionalTrustBundle` parameter is required unless the proxy's identity certificate is signed by an authority from the {op-system} trust bundle. If you use an MITM transparent proxy network that does not require additional proxy configuration but requires additional CAs, you must provide the MITM CA certificate.
<4> The `http-proxy` and `https-proxy` arguments must point to a valid URL.
