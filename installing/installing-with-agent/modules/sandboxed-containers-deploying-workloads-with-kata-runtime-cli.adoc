[id="sandboxed-containers-deploying-workloads-with-kata-runtime-cli_{context}"]
= Deploying a workload in a sandboxed container using the CLI

{sandboxed-containers-first} installs Kata as a secondary, optional runtime on your cluster, and not as the primary runtime.

To deploy a pod-templated workload in a sandboxed container, you must add `kata` as the `runtimeClassName` to the workload YAML file.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed {product-title} {product-version} on your cluster.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the {sandboxed-containers-operator}.
* You have created a `KataConfig` custom resource (CR).

.Procedure

* Add `runtimeClassName: kata` to any pod-templated object:
** `Pod` objects
** `ReplicaSet` objects
** `ReplicationController` objects
** `StatefulSet` objects
** `Deployment` objects
** `DeploymentConfig` objects

.Example for Pod objects
[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
   name: mypod
  spec:
    runtimeClassName: kata
----

.Example for Deployment objects
[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: mypod
    labels:
      app: mypod
  spec:
    replicas: 3
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: mypod
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: mypod
      spec:
        runtimeClassName: kata
        containers:
        - name: mypod
          image: myImage
----

{product-title} creates the workload and begins scheduling it.

.Verification

* Inspect the `runtimeClassName` field on a pod-templated object. If the `runtimeClassName` is `kata`, then the workload is running on a {sandboxed-containers-first}.
