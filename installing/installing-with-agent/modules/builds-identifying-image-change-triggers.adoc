= Identifying the image change trigger of a build

As a developer, if you have image change triggers, you can identify which image change initiated the last build. This can be useful for debugging or troubleshooting builds.

.Prerequisites

* You have configured multiple image change triggers. These triggers have triggered one or more builds.

.Procedure

. In `buildConfig.status.imageChangeTriggers` to identify the `lastTriggerTime` that has the latest timestamp.
+
This `ImageChangeTriggerStatus`


 Then you use the `name` and `namespace` from that build to find the corresponding image change trigger in `buildConfig.spec.triggers`.

. Under `imageChangeTriggers`, compare  timestamps to identify the latest

.Image change triggers

In your build configuration, `buildConfig.spec.triggers` is an array of build trigger policies, `BuildTriggerPolicy`.

Each `BuildTriggerPolicy` has a `type` field and set of pointers fields. Each pointer field corresponds to one of the allowed values for the `type` field. As such, you can only set `BuildTriggerPolicy` to only one pointer field.

For image change triggers, the value of `type` is `ImageChange`. Then, the `imageChange` field is the pointer to an `ImageChangeTrigger` object, which has the following fields:

* `lastTriggeredImageID`: This field, which is not shown in the example, is deprecated in {product-title} 4.8 and will be ignored in a future release. It contains the resolved image reference for the `ImageStreamTag` when the last build was triggered from this `BuildConfig`.
* `paused`: You can use this field, which is not shown in the example, to temporarily disable this particular image change trigger.
* `from`: You use this field to reference the `ImageStreamTag` that drives this image change trigger. Its type is the core Kubernetes type, `OwnerReference`.

The `from` field has the following fields of note:
** `kind`: For image change triggers, the only supported value is `ImageStreamTag`.
** `namespace`: You use this field to specify the namespace of the `ImageStreamTag`.
** `name`: You use this field to specify the `ImageStreamTag`.

.Image change trigger status

In your build configuration, `buildConfig.status.imageChangeTriggers` is an array of `ImageChangeTriggerStatus` elements. Each `ImageChangeTriggerStatus` element includes the `from`, `lastTriggeredImageID`, and `lastTriggerTime` elements shown in the preceding example.

The `ImageChangeTriggerStatus` that has the most recent `lastTriggerTime` triggered the most recent build. You use its `name` and `namespace` to identify the image change trigger in `buildConfig.spec.triggers` that triggered the build.

The `lastTriggerTime` with the most recent timestamp signifies the `ImageChangeTriggerStatus` of the last build. This `ImageChangeTriggerStatus` has the same `name` and `namespace` as the image change trigger in `buildConfig.spec.triggers` that triggered the build.
