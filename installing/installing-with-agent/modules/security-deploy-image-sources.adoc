= Controlling what image sources can be deployed

It is important that the intended images are actually being deployed, that the
images including the contained content
are from trusted sources, and they have not been altered. Cryptographic signing
provides this assurance. {product-title} enables cluster administrators to apply
security policy that is broad or narrow, reflecting deployment environment and
security requirements. Two parameters define this policy:

* one or more registries, with optional project namespace
* trust type, such as accept, reject, or require public key(s)

You can use these policy parameters to allow, deny, or require a trust
relationship for entire registries, parts of registries, or individual
images. Using trusted public keys, you can ensure that the source is
cryptographically verified.
The policy rules apply to nodes. Policy may be
applied uniformly across all nodes or targeted for different node workloads (for
example, build, zone, or environment).

The policy can be saved onto a node as `/etc/containers/policy.json`.
Saving this file to a node is best accomplished using a new
`MachineConfig` object. This
example enforces the following rules:

* Require images from the Red Hat Registry (`registry.access.redhat.com`) to be
signed by the Red Hat public key.
* Require images from your OpenShift Container Registry in the `openshift`
namespace to be signed by the Red Hat public key.
* Require images from your OpenShift Container Registry in the `production`
namespace to be signed by the public key for `example.com`.
* Reject all other registries not specified by the global `default` definition.
