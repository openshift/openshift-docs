= Installing {op-system-base} on the provisioner node

With the configuration of the prerequisites complete, the next step is to install {op-system-base} {op-system-version} on the provisioner node. The installer uses the provisioner node as the orchestrator while installing the {product-title} cluster. For the purposes of this document, installing {op-system-base} on the provisioner node is out of scope. However, options include but are not limited to using a RHEL Satellite server, PXE, or installation media.
