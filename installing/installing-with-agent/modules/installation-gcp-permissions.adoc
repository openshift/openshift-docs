= Required GCP permissions

When you attach the `Owner` role to the service account that you create, you
grant that service account all permissions, including those that are required to
install {product-title}. To deploy an {product-title} cluster, the service
account requires the following permissions. If you deploy your cluster into an existing VPC, the service account does not require certain networking permissions, which are noted in the following lists:

.Required roles for the installation program
* Compute Admin
* Security Admin
* Service Account Admin
* Service Account User
* Storage Admin

.Required roles for creating network resources during installation
* DNS Administrator

ifdef::template[]
.Required roles for user-provisioned GCP infrastructure
* Deployment Manager Editor
* Service Account Key Admin
endif::template[]

.Optional roles
For the cluster to create new limited credentials for its Operators, add
the following role:

* Service Account Key Admin

The roles are applied to the service accounts that the control plane and compute
machines use:
