= Specifying pipelines resource quota using priority class

A `PriorityClass` object maps priority class names to the integer values that indicates their relative priorities. Higher values increase the priority of a class. After you create a priority class, you can create pods that specify the priority class name in their specifications. In addition, you can control a pod's consumption of system resources based on the pod's priority.

Specifying resource quota for a pipeline is similar to setting a resource quota for the subset of pods created by a pipeline run. The following steps provide an example of the workaround by specifying resource quota based on priority class.

.Procedure

. Create a priority class for a pipeline.

.Example: Priority class for a pipeline
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: scheduling.k8s.io/v1
kind: PriorityClass
metadata:
  name: pipeline1-pc
value: 1000000
description: "Priority class for pipeline1"
----

. Create a resource quota for a pipeline.

----
Name:       pipeline1-rq
Namespace:  default
Resource    Used  Hard

cpu         0     1k
memory      0     200Gi
pods        0     10
----
+
Because pods are not running, the quota is unused.

. Create the pipelines and tasks.

[NOTE]
====
Ensure that all tasks in the pipeline belongs to the same priority class.

. Create and start the pipeline run.

. After the pods are created, verify the resource quota usage for the pipeline run.

The output indicates that you can manage the combined resource quota for all concurrent running pods belonging to a priority class, by specifying the resource quota per priority class.
