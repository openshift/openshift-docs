= OpenShift Container Registry

{product-title} includes the _OpenShift Container Registry_, a private registry
running as an integrated component of the platform that you can use to manage your container
images. The OpenShift Container Registry provides role-based access controls
that allow you to manage who can pull and push which container images.

{product-title} also supports integration with other private registries that you might
already be using, such as Red Hat Quay.
