= Enabling feature sets using the web console

You can use the {product-title} web console to enable feature sets for all of the nodes in a cluster by editing the `FeatureGate` custom resource (CR).

.Procedure

To enable feature sets:

. In the {product-title} web console, switch to the *Administration* -> *Custom Resource Definitions* page.

. On the *Custom Resource Definitions* page, click *FeatureGate*.

. On the *Custom Resource Definition Details* page, click the *Instances* tab.

. Click the *cluster* feature gate, then click the *YAML* tab.

. Edit the *cluster* instance to add specific feature sets:
+
.Sample Feature Gate custom resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: FeatureGate
metadata:
  name: cluster <1>
....

spec:
  featureSet: TechPreviewNoUpgrade <2>
----
+
--
<1> The name of the `FeatureGate` CR must be `cluster`.
<2> Add the feature set that you want to enable:
* `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` enables specific Technology Preview features.
--
+
After you save the changes, new machine configs are created, the machine config pools are updated, and scheduling on each node is disabled while the change is being applied.
+
[NOTE]
====
Enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set cannot be undone and prevents minor version updates. These feature sets are not recommended on production clusters. 
====

.Verification

You can verify that the feature gates are enabled by looking at the `kubelet.conf` file on a node after the nodes return to the ready state.

. From the *Administrator* perspective in the web console, navigate to *Compute* -> *Nodes*.

. Select a node.

. In the *Node details* page, click *Terminal*.

. In the terminal window, change your root directory to the host:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# chroot /host
----

. View the `kubelet.conf` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# cat /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
----
+
.Sample output
+
[source,terminal]
----
 ...
featureGates:
  InsightsOperatorPullingSCA: true,
  LegacyNodeRoleBehavior: false
 ...
----
+
The features that are listed as `true` are enabled on your cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
The features listed vary depending upon the {product-title} version.
