[id="ossm-threescale-webassembly-module-services-object_{context}"]
= The 3scale WebAssembly module services object

The `services` top-level object specifies which service identifiers are handled by this particular instance of the `module`.

Since accounts have multiple services, you must specify which ones are handled. The rest of the configuration revolves around how to configure services.

The `services` field is required. It is an array that must contain at least one service to be useful.
