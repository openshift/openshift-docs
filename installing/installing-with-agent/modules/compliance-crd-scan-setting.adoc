= ScanSetting object
Use the `ScanSetting` object to define and reuse the operational policies to run your scans.
By default, the Compliance Operator creates the following `ScanSetting` objects:

* *default* - it runs a scan every day at 1 AM on both master and worker nodes using a 1Gi Persistent Volume (PV) and keeps the last three results. Remediation is neither applied nor updated automatically.
* *default-auto-apply* - it runs a scan every day at 1AM on both control plane and worker nodes using a 1Gi Persistent Volume (PV) and keeps the last three results. Both `autoApplyRemediations` and `autoUpdateRemediations` are set to true.

metadata:
  name: <name of the scan>

----

<1> Set to `true` to enable auto remediations. Set to `false` to disable auto remediations.
<2> Set to `true` to enable auto remediations for content updates. Set to `false` to disable auto remediations for content updates.
<3> Specify how often the scan should be run in cron format.
<4> Specify the storage size that should be created for the scan to store the raw results. The default value is `1Gi`
<5> Specify the amount of scans for which the raw results will be stored. The default value is `3`. As the older results get rotated, the administrator has to store the results elsewhere before the rotation happens.

[NOTE]
====
To disable the rotation policy, set the value to `0`.
====
<6> Specify the `node-role.kubernetes.io` label value to schedule the scan for `Node` type. This value has to match the name of a `MachineConfigPool`.
