= Running the Operator

There are three ways you can use the Operator SDK CLI to build and run your Operator:

* Run locally outside the cluster as a Go program.
* Run as a deployment on the cluster.
* Bundle your Operator and use Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to deploy on the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Before running your Go-based Operator as either a deployment on {product-title} or as a bundle that uses OLM, ensure that your project has been updated to use supported images.
