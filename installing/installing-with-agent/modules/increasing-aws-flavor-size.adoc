=  Increasing the flavor size of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) master instances

When you have overloaded AWS master nodes in a cluster and the master nodes require more resources, you can increase the flavor size of the master instances.
[NOTE]
====
It is recommended to backup etcd before increasing the flavor size of the AWS master instances.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have an IPI (installer-provisioned infrastructure) or UPI (user-provisioned infrastructure) cluster on AWS.


.Procedure

. Open the AWS console, fetch the master instances.

. Stop one master instance.

. Select the stopped instance, and click *Actions* -> *Instance Settings* -> *Change instance type*.

. Change the instance to a larger type, ensuring that the type is the same base as the previous selection, and apply changes. For example, you can change `m6i.xlarge` to `m6i.2xlarge` or `m6i.4xlarge`.

. Backup the instance, and repeat the steps for the next master instance.
