= Enabling access to the environment

At deployment, all {product-title} machines are created in a {rh-openstack-first}-tenant network. Therefore, they are not accessible directly in most {rh-openstack} deployments.

You can configure {product-title} API and application access by using floating IP addresses (FIPs) during installation. You can also complete an installation without configuring FIPs, but the installer will not configure a way to reach the API or applications externally.
