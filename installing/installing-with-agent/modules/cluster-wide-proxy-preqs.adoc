= Prerequisites for configuring a cluster-wide proxy

To configure a cluster-wide proxy, you must meet the following requirements. These requirements are valid for both fresh installation and post installation proxy configuration.

[id="cluster-wide-proxy-general-prereqs_{context}"]
== General requirements

* You are the cluster owner.
* Your account has sufficient privileges.
* You have added the `ec2.<region>.amazonaws.com`, `elasticloadbalancing.<region>.amazonaws.com`, and `s3.<region>.amazonaws.com` endpoints to your virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint. These endpoints are required to complete requests from the nodes to the AWS EC2 API. Because the proxy works on the container level, not the node level, you must route these requests to the AWS EC2 API through the AWS private network. Adding the public IP address of the EC2 API to your allowlist in your proxy server is not sufficient.
ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
* You have the `rosa` CLI installed and configured.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
* You must have a Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) cluster with a VPC that the proxy can access.
* You have the `ocm` CLI installed and configured.
endif::[]

[id="cluster-wide-proxy-network-prereqs_{context}"]
== Network requirements

* If your proxy re-encyrpts egress traffic, you must create exclusions to the domain and port combinations. The following table offers guidance into these exceptions.
