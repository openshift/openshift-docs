[id="knative-service-cluster-local_{context}"]
= Setting cluster availability to cluster local

By default, Knative services are published to a public IP address.
Being published to a public IP address means that Knative services are public applications, and have a publicly accessible URL.

Publicly accessible URLs are accessible from outside of the cluster.
However, developers may need to build back-end services that are only be accessible from inside the cluster, known as _private services_.
// Cluster administrators can configure private services for the cluster so that all services are private by default.
// Need to add additional details about editing the configmap for admins
Developers can label individual services in the cluster with the `networking.knative.dev/visibility=cluster-local` label to make them private.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For {ServerlessProductName} 1.15.0 and newer versions, the `serving.knative.dev/visibility` label is no longer available. You must update existing services to use the `networking.knative.dev/visibility` label instead.

// remove note for 4.10, OSD

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving are installed on the cluster.
* You have created a Knative service.

.Procedure

* Set the visibility for your service by adding the `networking.knative.dev/visibility=cluster-local` label:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label ksvc <service_name> networking.knative.dev/visibility=cluster-local
----

.Verification

* Check that the URL for your service is now in the format `\http://<service_name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`, by entering the following command and reviewing the output:
+
[source,termina]
----
$ oc get ksvc
----
+
.Example output
