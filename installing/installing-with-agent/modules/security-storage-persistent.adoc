=  Persistent volume plug-ins

Containers are useful for both stateless and stateful applications.
Protecting attached storage is a key element of securing stateful services.
Using the Container Storage Interface (CSI), {product-title} can
incorporate storage from any storage back end that supports the CSI interface.

{product-title} provides plug-ins for multiple types of storage, including:

* {rh-storage-first} *
* AWS Elastic Block Stores (EBS) *
* AWS Elastic File System (EFS) *
* Azure Disk *
* Azure File *
* OpenStack Cinder *
* GCE Persistent Disks *
* VMware vSphere *
* Network File System (NFS)
* FlexVolume
* Fibre Channel
* iSCSI

Plug-ins for those storage types with dynamic provisioning are marked with
an asterisk (*). Data in transit is encrypted via HTTPS for all
{product-title} components communicating with each other.

You can mount a persistent volume (PV) on a host in any way supported by your
storage type. Different types of storage have different capabilities and each
PV's access modes are set to the specific modes supported by that particular
volume.

For example, NFS can support multiple read/write clients, but a specific NFS PV
might be exported on the server as read-only. Each PV has its own set of access
modes describing that specific PV's capabilities, such as `ReadWriteOnce`,
`ReadOnlyMany`, and `ReadWriteMany`.
