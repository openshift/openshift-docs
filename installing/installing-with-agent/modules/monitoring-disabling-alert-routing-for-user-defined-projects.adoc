= Disabling alert routing for user-defined projects

[role="_abstract"]
If you have enabled alert routing for user-defined projects, you can disable it. By doing so, you prevent users with the **alert-routing-edit** role from configuring alert routing for user-defined projects in Alertmanager.

[NOTE]
====
Alert routing for user-defined projects is disabled by default. You do not need to disable it if the feature is not already enabled.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have enabled alert routing for user-defined projects.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----
+
. Change the value to `false` for `enableUserAlertmanagerConfig` under the `alertmanagerMain` key in `data/config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    enableUserWorkload: true
    alertmanagerMain:
      enableUserAlertmanagerConfig: false <1>
----
<1> When set to `false`, the `enableUserAlertmanagerConfig` parameter disables alert routing for user-defined projects in a cluster.
+
. Save the file to apply the changes. Alert routing for user-defined projects is disabled automatically.
