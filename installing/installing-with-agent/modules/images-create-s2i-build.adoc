= Understanding the source-to-image build process

The build process consists of the following three fundamental elements, which are combined into a final container image:

* Sources
* Source-to-image (S2I) scripts
* Builder image

S2I generates a Dockerfile with the builder image as the first `FROM` instruction. The Dockerfile generated by S2I is then passed to Buildah.
