= Service serving certificate secrets

Service serving certificate secrets are intended to support complex middleware applications that need out-of-the-box certificates. It has the same settings as the server certificates generated by the administrator tooling for nodes and masters.

.Procedure

To secure communication to your service, have the cluster generate a signed serving certificate/key pair into a secret in your namespace.

* Set the `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name` annotation on your service with the value set to the name you want to use for your secret.
+
Then, your `PodSpec` can mount that secret. When it is available, your pod runs. The certificate is good for the internal service DNS name, `<service.name>.<service.namespace>.svc`.
+
The certificate and key are in PEM format, stored in `tls.crt` and `tls.key` respectively. The certificate/key pair is automatically replaced when it gets close to expiration. View the expiration date in the `service.beta.openshift.io/expiry` annotation on the secret, which is in RFC3339 format.

[NOTE]
====
In most cases, the service DNS name `<service.name>.<service.namespace>.svc` is not externally routable. The primary use of `<service.name>.<service.namespace>.svc` is for intracluster or intraservice communication, and with re-encrypt routes.
====

Other pods can trust cluster-created certificates, which are only signed for
internal DNS names, by using the certificate authority (CA) bundle in the `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-ca.crt` file that is automatically mounted in their pod.

The signature algorithm for this feature is `x509.SHA256WithRSA`. To manually rotate, delete the generated secret. A new certificate is created.
