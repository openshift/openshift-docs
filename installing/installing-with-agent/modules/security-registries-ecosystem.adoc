= Getting containers from Red Hat Registry and Ecosystem Catalog

Red Hat lists certified container images for Red Hat products and partner offerings from the
link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/explore[Container Images]
section of the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog. From that catalog,
you can see details of each image, including CVE, software packages listings, and health
scores.

Red Hat images are actually stored in what is referred to as the _Red Hat Registry_,
which is represented by a public container registry (`registry.access.redhat.com`)
and an authenticated registry (`registry.redhat.io`).
Both include basically the same set of container images, with
`registry.redhat.io` including some additional images that require authentication
with Red Hat subscription credentials.

Container content is monitored for vulnerabilities by Red Hat and updated
regularly. When Red Hat releases security updates, such as fixes to _glibc_,
link:https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/drown[DROWN], or
link:https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/2757141[Dirty Cow],
any affected container images are also rebuilt and pushed
to the Red Hat Registry.

Red Hat uses a `health index` to reflect the security risk for each container provided through
the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog. Because containers consume software provided by Red
Hat and the errata process, old, stale containers are insecure whereas new,
fresh containers are more secure.

To illustrate the age of containers, the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog uses a
grading system. A freshness grade is a measure of the oldest and most severe
security errata available for an image. "A" is more up to date than "F". See
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2803031[Container Health Index grades as used inside the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog] for more details on this grading system.
