= Minor versions (x.Y.z)

Starting with the 4.8 OpenShift Container Platform minor version, Red Hat supports all minor
versions within a 9 month period following general availability of the given minor version. Patch
versions do not affect the 9 month supportability period.

Customers are notified 60, 30, and 15 days prior to the end of the 9 month period. Clusters must be upgraded to
a supported minor version prior to the end of the 9 month period, or the cluster will enter
a "Limited Support" status.

.Example
. A customer's cluster is currently running on 4.8.14. The 4.8 minor version became generally
  available on July 27, 2021.
. On Feb 26, March 28, and April 12, 2022, the customer is notified that their cluster will enter "Limited Support" status
  on April 27, 2022 if the cluster has not already been upgraded to a supported minor version.
. The cluster must be upgraded to 4.9 or later by April 27, 2022.
. If the upgrade has not been performed, the cluster will be flagged as being in a "Limited Support" status.
