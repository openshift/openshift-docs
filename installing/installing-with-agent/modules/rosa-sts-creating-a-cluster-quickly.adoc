= Creating a ROSA cluster with STS using the default options

Through the {product-title} CLI (`rosa`), you can quickly create an OpenShift cluster that uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS).

Additionally, you can use `auto` mode to immediately create the required AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources using the current AWS account. `auto` mode is used in the following procedure to immediately create the account-wide IAM roles and policies, including the Operator policies, as well as the OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider.

.Prerequisites

* You have completed the AWS prerequisites for ROSA with STS.
* You have available AWS service quotas.
* You have enabled the ROSA service in the AWS Console.
* You installed and configured the latest AWS (`aws`), ROSA (`rosa`), and OpenShift (`oc`) CLIs on your workstation.
* You logged in to your Red Hat account by using the `rosa` CLI.
* You verified that the AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service role exists in your AWS account.

[NOTE]
====
To successfully install ROSA 4.10 clusters, use ROSA CLI 1.1.11 or above.
====

.Procedure

. Create the required account-wide roles and policies, including the Operator policies:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create account-roles --mode auto
----
+
[NOTE]
====
When using `auto` mode, you can optionally specify the `-y` argument to bypass the interactive prompts and automatically confirm operations.
====

. Create a cluster with STS using the defaults. When you use the defaults, the latest stable OpenShift version is installed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create cluster --cluster-name <cluster_name> --sts --mode auto <1>
----
<1> Replace `<cluster_name>` with the name of your cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
When you specify `--mode auto`, the `rosa create cluster` command creates the cluster-specific Operator IAM roles and the OIDC provider automatically. The Operators use the OIDC provider to authenticate.
====

. Check the status of your cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa describe cluster --cluster <cluster_name|cluster_id>
----
+
The following `State` field changes are listed in the output as the cluster installation progresses:
+
* `waiting (Waiting for OIDC configuration)`
* `pending (Preparing account)`
* `installing (DNS setup in progress)`
* `installing`
* `ready`
+
[NOTE]
====
If installation fails or the `State` field does not change to `ready` after about 40 minutes, check the installation troubleshooting documentation for more details.
====

. Track the progress of the cluster creation by watching the OpenShift installer logs:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa logs install --cluster <cluster_name|cluster_id> --watch <1>
----
<1> Specify the `--watch` flag to watch for new log messages as the installation progresses. This argument is optional.
