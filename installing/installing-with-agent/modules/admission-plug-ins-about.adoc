= About admission plug-ins

Admission plug-ins are used to help regulate how {product-title} {product-version} functions. Admission plug-ins intercept requests to the master API to validate resource requests and ensure policies are adhered to, after the request is authenticated and authorized. For example, they are commonly used to enforce security policy, resource limitations or configuration requirements.

Admission plug-ins run in sequence as an admission chain. If any admission plug-in in the sequence rejects a request, the whole chain is aborted and an error is returned.

{product-title} has a default set of admission plug-ins enabled for each resource type. These are required for proper functioning of the cluster. Admission plug-ins ignore resources that they are not responsible for.

In addition to the defaults, the admission chain can be extended dynamically through webhook admission plug-ins that call out to custom webhook servers. There are two types of webhook admission plug-ins: a mutating admission plug-in and a validating admission plug-in. The mutating admission plug-in runs first and can both modify resources and validate requests. The validating admission plug-in validates requests and runs after the mutating admission plug-in so that modifications triggered by the mutating admission plug-in can also be validated.

Calling webhook servers through a mutating admission plug-in can produce side effects on resources related to the target object. In such situations, you must take steps to validate that the end result is as expected.

[WARNING]
====
Dynamic admission should be used cautiously because it impacts cluster control plane operations. When calling webhook servers through webhook admission plug-ins in {product-title} {product-version}, ensure that you have read the documentation fully and tested for side effects of mutations. Include steps to restore resources back to their original state prior to mutation, in the event that a request does not pass through the entire admission chain.
