= Preparing the bare metal node

Expanding the cluster requires a DHCP server. Each node must have a DHCP reservation.

[IMPORTANT]
.Reserving IP addresses so they become static IP addresses
====
Some administrators prefer to use static IP addresses so that each node's IP address remains constant in the absence of a DHCP server. To configure static IP addresses with NMState, see "(Optional) Configuring host network interfaces in the `install-config.yaml` file" in the "Setting up the environment for an OpenShift installation" section for additional details.
====

Preparing the bare metal node requires executing the following procedure from the provisioner node.

.Procedure

. Get the `oc` binary, if needed. It should already exist on the provisioner node.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -s https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/$VERSION/openshift-client-linux-$VERSION.tar.gz | tar zxvf - oc
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo cp oc /usr/local/bin
----

. Power off the bare metal node by using the baseboard management controller (BMC), and ensure it is off.

. Retrieve the user name and password of the bare metal node's baseboard management controller. Then, create `base64` strings from the user name and password:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ echo -ne "root" | base64
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ echo -ne "password" | base64
----

. Create a configuration file for the bare metal node.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ vim bmh.yaml

----
<1> Optional: To configure network for a newly created node, specify the name of the secret that contains the network configuration. Follow the `nmstate` syntax to define the network configuration for your node.
<2> Replace `<num>` for the worker number of the bare metal node in the `name` fields, the `credentialsName` field, and the `preprovisioningNetworkDataName` field.
<3> Replace `<base64-of-uid>` with the `base64` string of the user name.
<4> Replace `<base64-of-pwd>` with the `base64` string of the password.
<5> Replace `<NIC1-mac-address>` with the MAC address of the bare metal node's first NIC. See the "BMC addressing" section for additional BMC configuration options.
<6> Replace `<protocol>` with the BMC protocol, such as IPMI, RedFish, or others. Replace `<bmc-ip>` with the IP address of the bare metal node's baseboard management controller.
<7> To skip certificate validation, set `disableCertificateVerification` to `true`.
<8> Replace `<bmc-username>` with the `bmc` string of the user name.
<9> Replace `<bmc-password>` with the `bmc` string of the password.
<10> Optional: Provide the network configuration secret name in the `preprovisioningNetworkDataName` of the `BareMetalHost` CR if you have configured network for the newly created node.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the MAC address of an existing bare metal node matches the MAC address of a bare metal host that you are attempting to provision, then the Ironic installation will fail. If the host enrollment, inspection, cleaning, or other Ironic steps fail, the Bare Metal Operator retries the installation continuously. See "Diagnosing a host duplicate MAC address" for more information.
====

. Create the bare metal node.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-machine-api create -f bmh.yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
secret/openshift-worker-<num>-network-config-secret created
secret/openshift-worker-<num>-bmc-secret created
baremetalhost.metal3.io/openshift-worker-<num> created
----
+
Where `<num>` will be the worker number.

. Power up and inspect the bare metal node.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-machine-api get bmh openshift-worker-<num>
----
+
Where `<num>` is the worker node number.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----

----

[NOTE]
====
To allow the worker node to join the cluster, scale the `machineset` object to the number of the `BareMetalHost` objects. You can scale nodes either manually or automatically. To scale nodes automatically, use the `metal3.io/autoscale-to-hosts` annotation for `machineset`.
