= About dynamic plug-ins

A dynamic plug-in allows you to add custom pages and other extensions to your interface at runtime. The `ConsolePlugin` custom resource registers plug-ins with the console, and a cluster administrator enables plug-ins in the `console-operator` configuration.

[id="dynamic-plugins-features"]
== Key features

A dynamic plug-in allows you to make the following customizations to the {product-title} experience:

* Add custom pages.
* Add perspectives and update navigation items.
* Add tabs and actions to resource pages.

== PatternFly 4 guidelines
When creating your plug-in, follow these guidelines for using PatternFly:

* Use link:https://www.patternfly.org/v4/[PatternFly4] components and PatternFly CSS variables. Core PatternFly components are available through the SDK. Using PatternFly components and variables will help your plug-in look consistent in future console versions.
* Make your plug-in accessible by following link:https://www.patternfly.org/v4/accessibility/accessibility-fundamentals/[PatternFly's accessibility fundamentals].
* _Do not_ use other CSS libraries such as Bootstrap or Tailwind. They can conflict with PatternFly and will not match the console look and feel.

[id="general-plug-in-guidelines"]
== General guidelines
When creating your plug-in, follow these general guidelines:

* Prefix your CSS class names with your plug-in name to avoid collisions. For example, `my-plugin_\_heading` and `my-plugin_\_icon`.
* Maintain a consistent look, feel, and behavior with other console pages.
* Use link:https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/console/dynamic-plugins.md#localization[react-i18next] for localization.
* _Do not_ use console CSS classes in your markup or override console CSS classes. These are not APIs and are subject to change. Using them might break your plug-in. Avoid selectors like element selectors that could affect markup outside of your plug-inâ€™s components.
