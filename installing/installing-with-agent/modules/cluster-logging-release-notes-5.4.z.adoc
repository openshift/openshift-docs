=== Bug fixes
* Before this update, the log file metric exporter only reported logs created while the exporter was running, which resulted in inaccurate log growth data. This update resolves this issue by monitoring `/var/log/pods`. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2442[LOG-2442])

* Before this update, the collector would be blocked because it continually tried to use a stale connection when forwarding logs to fluentd forward receivers. With this release, the `keepalive_timeout` value has been set to 30 seconds (`30s`) so that the collector recycles the connection and re-attempts to send failed messages within a reasonable amount of time. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2534[LOG-2534])

* Before this update, an error in the gateway component enforcing tenancy for reading logs limited access to logs with a Kubernetes namespace causing "audit" and some "infrastructure" logs to be unreadable. With this update, the proxy correctly detects users with admin access and allows access to logs without a namespace. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2448[LOG-2448])

* Before this update, `system:serviceaccount:openshift-monitoring:prometheus-k8s` had cluster level privileges as a `clusterrole` and `clusterrolebinding`. This update restricts the `serviceaccount` to the `openshift-logging` namespace with a role and rolebinding. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2437[LOG-2437])

* Before this update, Linux audit log time parsing relied on an ordinal position of a key/value pair. This update changes the parsing to use a regular expression to find the time entry.  (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2321[LOG-2321])
