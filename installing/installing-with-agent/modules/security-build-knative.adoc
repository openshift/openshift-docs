= Building Knative serverless applications

Relying on Kubernetes and Kourier, you can build, deploy, and manage serverless applications by using OpenShift Serverless in {product-title}.

As with other builds, you can use S2I images to build your containers, then serve them using Knative services. View Knative application builds through the
*Topology* view of the {product-title} web console.
