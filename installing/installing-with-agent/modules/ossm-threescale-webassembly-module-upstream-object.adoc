.`upstream` object fields
|===
|Name |Description |Required

a|`name`
a|`name` is not a free-form identifier. It is the identifier for the external host as defined by the proxy configuration. In the case of stand-alone `Envoy` configurations, it maps to the name of a link:https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.19.0/api-v3/config/cluster/v3/cluster.proto#config-cluster-v3-cluster[Cluster], also known as `upstream` in other proxies. *Note:* the value of this field, because the {SMProductShortName} and 3scale Istio adapter control plane configure the name according to a format using a vertical bar (\|) as the separator of multiple fields. For the purposes of this integration, always use the format: `outbound\|<port>\|\|<hostname>`.
|Yes

a|`url`
|The complete URL to access the described service. Unless implied by the scheme, you must include the TCP port.
|Yes

a|`Timeout`
|Timeout in milliseconds so that connections to this service that take more than the amount of time to respond will be considered errors. Default is 1000 seconds.
|Optional
