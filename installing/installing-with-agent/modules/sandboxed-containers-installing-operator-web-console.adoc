= Installing the {sandboxed-containers-operator} using the web console

You can install the {sandboxed-containers-operator} from the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites

* You have {product-title} {product-version} installed.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. From the *Administrator* perspective in the web console, navigate to *Operators* → *OperatorHub*.

. In the *Filter by keyword* field, type `OpenShift sandboxed containers`.

. Select the *{sandboxed-containers-first}* tile.

. Read the information about the Operator and click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page:
.. Select *stable-{sandboxed-containers-version}* from the list of available *Update Channel* options.
.. Verify that *Operator recommended Namespace* is selected for *Installed Namespace*. This installs the Operator in the mandatory `openshift-sandboxed-containers-operator` namespace. If this namespace does not yet exist, it is automatically created.
+
[NOTE]
====
Attempting to install the {sandboxed-containers-operator} in a namespace other than `openshift-sandboxed-containers-operator` causes the installation to fail.
====
.. Verify that *Automatic* is selected for *Approval Strategy*. *Automatic* is the default value, and enables automatic updates to {sandboxed-containers-first} when a new z-stream release is available.

. Click *Install*.

The {sandboxed-containers-operator} is now installed on your cluster.
