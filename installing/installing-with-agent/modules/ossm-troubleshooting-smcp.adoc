= Troubleshooting the Service Mesh control plane

If you are experiencing issues while deploying the Service Mesh control plane,

* Ensure that the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource is installed in a project that is separate from your services and Operators. This documentation uses the `istio-system` project as an example, but you can deploy your control plane in any project as long as it is separate from the project that contains your Operators and services.

* Ensure that the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` and `Jaeger` custom resources are deployed in the same project. For example, use the `istio-system` project for both.

//* If you selected to install the Elasticsearch Operator in a specific namespace in the cluster instead of selecting *All namespaces in on the cluster (default)*, then OpenShift could not automatically copy the Operator to the istio-system namespace and the {JaegerName} Operator could not call the Elasticsearch Operator during the installation?

//The steps for deploying the service mesh control plane (SMCP) include verifying the deployment in the OpenShift console.
