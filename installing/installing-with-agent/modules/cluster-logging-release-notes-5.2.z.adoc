=== Bug fixes
* Before this update some log forwarder outputs could re-order logs with the same time-stamp. With this update, a sequence number has been added to the log record to order entries that have matching timestamps.(https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2335[LOG-2335])

* Before this update, clusters with a large number of namespaces caused Elasticsearch to stop serving requests because the list of namespaces reached the maximum header size limit. With this update, headers only include a list of namespace names, resolving the issue. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2475[LOG-2475])

* Before this update, `system:serviceaccount:openshift-monitoring:prometheus-k8s` had cluster level privileges as a `clusterrole` and `clusterrolebinding`. This update restricts the `serviceaccount` to the `openshift-logging` namespace with a role and rolebinding. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2480[LOG-2480])

* Before this update, the `cluster-logging-operator` utilized cluster scoped roles and bindings to establish permissions for the Prometheus service account to scrape metrics. These permissions were only created when deploying the Operator using the console interface, and were missing when the Operator was deployed from the command line. This fixes the issue by making this role and binding namespace scoped. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1972[LOG-1972])

* Before this update, defining a toleration with no key and the existing Operator caused the Operator to be unable to complete an upgrade. With this update, this toleration no longer blocks the upgrade from completing. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2304[LOG-2304])

* Before this update, Elasticsearch pods failed to start after updating with FIPS enabled. With this update, Elasticsearch pods start successfully. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2000[LOG-2000])

* Before this update, if a persistent volume claim (PVC) already existed, Elasticsearch generated an error, "Unable to create PersistentVolumeClaim due to forbidden: exceeded quota: infra-storage-quota." With this update, Elasticsearch checks for existing PVCs, resolving the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2118[LOG-2118])

[id="openshift-logging-5-2-5-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes
* Before this update, Elasticsearch rejected logs from the Event Router due to a parsing error. This update changes the data model to resolve the parsing error. However, as a result, previous indices might cause warnings or errors within Kibana. The `kubernetes.event.metadata.resourceVersion` field causes errors until existing indices are removed or reindexed. If this field is not used in Kibana, you can ignore the error messages. If you have a retention policy that deletes old indices, the policy eventually removes the old indices and stops the error messages. Otherwise, manually reindex to stop the error messages. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2087[LOG-2087])

[id="openshift-logging-5-2-4-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Before this update records shipped via syslog would serialize a ruby hash encoding key/value pairs to contain a '=>' character, as well as replace tabs with "#11".  This update serializes the message correctly as proper JSON. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1775[LOG-1775])

* Before this update, the Elasticsearch Prometheus exporter plugin compiled index-level metrics using a high-cost query that impacted the Elasticsearch node performance. This update implements a lower-cost query that improves performance. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1970[LOG-1970])

* Before this update, Elasticsearch sometimes rejected messages when Log Forwarding was configured with multiple outputs. This happened because configuring one of the outputs modified message content to be a single message. With this update, Log Forwarding duplicates the messages for each output so that output-specific processing does not affect the other outputs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1824[LOG-1824])

* Before this update, some alerts did not include a namespace label. This omission doesn't comply with the OpenShift Monitoring Team's guidelines for writing alerting rules in OpenShift. With this update, all the alerts in Elasticsearch Operator include a namespace label and follow all the guidelines for writing alerting rules in OpenShift.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1857[LOG-1857])

* Before this update, a regression introduced in a prior release intentionally disabled JSON message parsing. This update re-enables JSON parsing. It also sets the log entry "level" based on the "level" field in parsed JSON message or by using regex to extract a match from a message field.

== OpenShift Logging 5.2.2

This release includes link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2021:3747[RHBA-2021:3747 OpenShift Logging Bug Fix Release 5.2.2]

[id="openshift-logging-5-2-2-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Before this update, the `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR) applied the value of the `totalLimitSize` field to the Fluentd `total_limit_size` field, even if the required buffer space was not available. With this update, the CR applies the lesser of the two `totalLimitSize` or 'default' values to the Fluentd `total_limit_size` field, resolving the issue.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1738[LOG-1738])

* Before this update, a regression introduced in a prior release configuration caused the collector to flush its buffered messages before shutdown, creating a delay the termination and restart of collector Pods. With this update, fluentd no longer flushes buffers at shutdown, resolving the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1739[LOG-1739])

* Before this update, an issue in the bundle manifests prevented installation of the Elasticsearch operator through OLM on OpenShift 4.9. With this update, a correction to bundle manifests re-enables installs and upgrades in 4.9.(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1780[LOG-1780])

This release includes link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2021:3550[RHBA-2021:3550 OpenShift Logging Bug Fix Release 5.2.1]

[id="openshift-logging-5-2-1-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* Before this update, due to an issue in the release pipeline scripts, the value of the `olm.skipRange` field remained unchanged at `5.2.0` instead of reflecting the current release number. This update fixes the pipeline scripts to update the value of this field when the release numbers change. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1743[LOG-1743])
