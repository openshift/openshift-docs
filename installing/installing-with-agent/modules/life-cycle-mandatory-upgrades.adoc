= Mandatory upgrades

In the event that a Critical or Important CVE, or other bug identified by Red Hat, significantly
impacts the security or stability of the cluster, the customer must upgrade to the next supported
patch release within two link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2623321[business days].

In extreme circumstances and based on Red Hat's assessment of the CVE criticality to the
environment, if the upgrade to the next supported patch release has not been performed within
two link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2623321[business days] of notification, the cluster
will be automatically updated to the latest patch release to mitigate potential security breach
or instability.
