= Backup and Restore CR issues

You might encounter these common issues with `Backup` and `Restore` custom resources (CRs).

[id="backup-cannot-retrieve-volume_{context}"]
== Backup CR cannot retrieve volume

The `Backup` CR displays the error message, `InvalidVolume.NotFound: The volume ‘vol-xxxx’ does not exist`.

.Cause

The persistent volume (PV) and the snapshot locations are in different regions.

.Solution

. Edit the value of the `spec.snapshotLocations.velero.config.region` key in the `DataProtectionApplication` manifest so that the snapshot location is in the same region as the PV.
. Create a new `Backup` CR.

[id="backup-cr-remains-in-progress_{context}"]
== Backup CR status remains in progress

The status of a `Backup` CR remains in the `InProgress` phase and does not complete.

.Cause

If a backup is interrupted, it cannot be resumed.

.Solution

. Retrieve the details of the `Backup` CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n {namespace} exec deployment/velero -c velero -- ./velero \
  backup describe <backup>
----

. Delete the `Backup` CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete backup <backup> -n openshift-adp
----
+
You do not need to clean up the backup location because a `Backup` CR in progress has not uploaded  files to object storage.

. Create a new `Backup` CR.
