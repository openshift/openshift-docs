= New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

== New features and enhancements {DTProductName} 2.4

This release of {DTProductName} addresses Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and bug fixes.

This release also adds support for auto-provisioning certificates using the Red Hat Elasticsearch Operator.

* Self-provisioning, which means using the {JaegerName} Operator to call the Red Hat Elasticsearch Operator during installation. Self provisioning is fully supported with this release.
* Creating the Elasticsearch instance and certificates first and then configuring the {JaegerShortName} to use the certificate is a Technology Preview for this release.

[NOTE]
====
When upgrading to Elasticsearch 2.4, the Operator recreates the Elasticsearch instance, which might take five to ten minutes.

* Updates {JaegerName} Operator to Jaeger 1.28. Going forward, {DTProductName} will only support the `stable` Operator channel. Channels for individual releases are no longer supported.

* Introduces a new {OTELName} Operator based on OpenTelemetry 0.33. Note that this Operator is a Technology Preview feature.

* Adds support for OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) to the Query service.
