== Fixed issues

The following issue has been resolved in the current release:

* All versions of Argo CD are vulnerable to a path traversal bug that allows to pass arbitrary values to be consumed by Helm charts. This update fixes the `CVE-2022-24348 gitops` error, path traversal and dereference of symlinks when passing Helm value files. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-1756[GITOPS-1756]

* Before this update, the *Route* resources got stuck in `Progressing` Health status if more than one `Ingress` were attached to the route.  This update fixes the health check and reports the correct health status of the *Route* resources. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-1751[GITOPS-1751]
