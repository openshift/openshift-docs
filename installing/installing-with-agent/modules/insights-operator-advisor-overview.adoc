= About Red Hat Insights Advisor for {product-title}

You can use Insights Advisor to assess and monitor the health of your {product-title} clusters. Whether you are concerned about individual clusters, or with your whole infrastructure, it is important to be aware of your exposure to issues that can affect service availability, fault tolerance, performance, or security.

Insights repeatedly analyzes the data that Insights Operator sends using a database of _recommendations_, which are sets of conditions that can leave your {product-title} clusters at risk. Your data is then uploaded to the Insights Advisor service on Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console where you can perform the following actions:

* See clusters impacted by a specific recommendation.
* Use robust filtering capabilities to refine your results to those recommendations.
* Learn more about individual recommendations, details about the risks they present, and get resolutions tailored to your individual clusters.
* Share results with other stakeholders.
