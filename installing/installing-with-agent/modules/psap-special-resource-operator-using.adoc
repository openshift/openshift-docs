= Using the Special Resource Operator

The Special Resource Operator (SRO) is used to manage the build and deployment of a driver container. The objects required to build and deploy the container can be defined in a Helm chart.

The example in this section uses the simple-kmod `SpecialResource` object to point to a `ConfigMap` object that is created to store the Helm charts.
