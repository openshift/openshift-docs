[id="installation-performing-disconnected-mirror-without-registry"]
= Performing a mirror to disk for use in disconnected environments with a non-production mirror registry

If a production mirror registry is not available, you can configure a simple mirror registry by using the disconnected procedure to serve container images that you downloaded to disk.

.Procedure

. Determine the IP of your host within the restricted network as `<private_ip>`.

. On a local host, copy the required `imageContentSources` and `ImageContentSourcePolicy`:
.. Make the mirror directory and change to it:
+
----
$ mkdir <mirror_dir> ; cd <mirror_dir>
----

.. Mirror the images:
+
----
$ oc adm release mirror <product_version> --to file://openshift/release
----

. From within the restricted network, start an image mirror server on port 5000 on all interfaces on the host:
.. Change to the mirror directory:
+
----
$ cd MIRROR_DIR
----

.. Serve the images for the installation program to use:
+
----
$ oc image serve
----

This registry does not perform authentication and does not require TLS to guarantee integrity of the provided images.
