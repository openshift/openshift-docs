= Updating your mirror registry

After you publish a full image set to the mirror registry, you can use the oc-mirror plug-in to update the mirror registry with updated images.

When you run the oc-mirror plug-in again, it generates an image set that only contains new and updated images since the previous execution.

[NOTE]
====
You must use the same storage backend as the initial execution of oc-mirror for the same mirror registry. Do not delete or modify the metadata that is generated by the oc-mirror plug-in.
====

Because it only pulls in the differences since the previous image set was created, the generated image set is often smaller and faster to process than the initial image set.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Generated image sets are sequential and must be synchronized to the target mirror registry in order.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have used the oc-mirror plug-in to mirror the initial image set to your mirror registry.
* You have access to the storage backend that was used for the initial execution of the oc-mirror plug-in.

.Procedure

. Follow the same steps that you used to create the initial image set and mirror it to the mirror registry. For instructions, see _Mirroring an image set in a partially disconnected environment_ or _Mirroring an image set in a fully disconnected environment_.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
* You must provide the same storage backend so that only a differential image set is created and mirrored.
* If you specified a top-level namespace for the mirror registry during the initial image set creation, then you must use this same namespace every time you run the oc-mirror plug-in for the same mirror registry.
====

. Install the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` and `CatalogSource` resources into the cluster.
