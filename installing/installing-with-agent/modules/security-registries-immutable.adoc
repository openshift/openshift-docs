= Immutable and certified containers

Consuming security updates is particularly important when managing _immutable
containers_. Immutable containers are containers that will never be changed
while running. When you deploy immutable containers, you do not step into the
running container to replace one or more binaries. From an operational
standpoint, you rebuild and redeploy an updated container image
to replace a container instead of changing it.

Red Hat certified images are:

* Free of known vulnerabilities in the platform components or layers
* Compatible across the {op-system-base} platforms, from bare metal to cloud
* Supported by Red Hat

The list of known vulnerabilities is constantly evolving, so you must track the
contents of your deployed container images, as well as newly downloaded images,
over time. You can use
link:https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/security-advisories[Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSAs)]
to alert you to any newly discovered issues in
Red Hat certified container images, and direct you to the updated image.
Alternatively, you can go to the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog
to look up that and other security-related issues for each Red Hat image.
