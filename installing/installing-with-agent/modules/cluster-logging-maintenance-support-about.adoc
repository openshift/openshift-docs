= About unsupported configurations

The supported way of configuring the {logging-title} is by configuring it using the options described in this documentation. Do not use other configurations, as they are unsupported. Configuration paradigms might change across {product-title} releases, and such cases can only be handled gracefully if all configuration possibilities are controlled. If you use configurations other than those described in this documentation, your changes will disappear because the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator and Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator reconcile any differences. The Operators reverse everything to the defined state by default and by design.

[NOTE]
====
If you _must_ perform configurations not described in the {product-title} documentation, you _must_ set your Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator or OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator to *Unmanaged*. An unmanaged OpenShift Logging environment is _not supported_ and does not receive updates until you return OpenShift Logging to *Managed*.
