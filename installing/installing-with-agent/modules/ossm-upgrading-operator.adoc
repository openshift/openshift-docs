= Upgrading the Operators

[IMPORTANT]
====
The version of the Operator does _not_ determine the version of your service mesh. The current Operator supports both v1 and v2 service meshes.

Updating the Operator does not affect the version of any component other than the Operator. Updating the Operators does _not_ update the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` version or deployments.
====

When you installed your Operators, you selected an *Update Channel* and an *Approval Strategy*. Those two settings determine when and how your Operators are updated.
