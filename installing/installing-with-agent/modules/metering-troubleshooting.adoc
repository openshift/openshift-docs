= Troubleshooting metering

A common issue with metering is pods failing to start. Pods might fail to start due to lack of resources or if they have a dependency on a resource that does not exist, such as a `StorageClass` or `Secret` resource.

[id="metering-not-enough-compute-resources_{context}"]
== Not enough compute resources

A common issue when installing or running metering is a lack of compute resources. As the cluster grows and more reports are created, the Reporting Operator pod requires more memory. If memory usage reaches the pod limit, the cluster considers the pod out of memory (OOM) and terminates it with an `OOMKilled` status. Ensure that metering is allocated the minimum resource requirements described in the installation prerequisites.

[NOTE]
====
The Metering Operator does not autoscale the Reporting Operator based on the load in the cluster. Therefore, CPU usage for the Reporting Operator pod does not increase as the cluster grows.
====

To determine if the issue is with resources or scheduling, follow the troubleshooting instructions included in the Kubernetes document https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/#troubleshooting[Managing Compute Resources for Containers].

To troubleshoot issues due to a lack of compute resources, check the following within the `openshift-metering` namespace.

.Prerequisites

* You are currently in the `openshift-metering` namespace. Change to the `openshift-metering` namespace by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project openshift-metering

.Procedure

. Check for metering `Report` resources that fail to complete and show the status of `ReportingPeriodUnmetDependencies`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get reports
----

.Example output

=== Increasing the reporting-operator pod memory limit

If you are experiencing an increase in pod restarts and OOM kill events, you can check the current memory limit set for the Reporting Operator pod. Increasing the memory limit allows the Reporting Operator pod to update the report data sources. If necessary, increase the memory limit in your `MeteringConfig` resource by 25% - 50%.

.Procedure

. Check the current memory limits of the `reporting-operator` `Pod` resource:
+
[source,terminal]

$ oc describe pod reporting-operator-67d6f57c56-79mrt
----

   Environment:

----
<1> The current memory limit for the Reporting Operator pod.

. Edit the `MeteringConfig` resource to update the memory limit:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit meteringconfig/operator-metering
----
+
.Example `MeteringConfig` resource
[source,yaml]
----
kind: MeteringConfig
metadata:
  name: operator-metering
  namespace: openshift-metering

        memory: 750Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 500Mi
...
----
<1> Add or increase memory limits within the `resources` field of the `MeteringConfig` resource.
+
[NOTE]
====
If there continue to be numerous OOM killed events after memory limits are increased, this might indicate that a different issue is causing the reports to be in a pending state.

[id="metering-storageclass-not-configured_{context}"]
== StorageClass resource not configured

Metering requires that a default `StorageClass` resource be configured for dynamic provisioning.

See the documentation on configuring metering for information on how to check if there are any `StorageClass` resources configured for the cluster, how to set the default, and how to configure metering to use a storage class other than the default.

[id="metering-secret-not-configured-correctly_{context}"]
== Secret not configured correctly

A common issue with metering is providing the incorrect secret when configuring your persistent storage. Be sure to review the example configuration files and create you secret according to the guidelines for your storage provider.
