= About the address pool custom resource

The fields for the address pool custom resource are described in the following table.

.MetalLB address pool custom resource
[cols="1,1,3a", options="header"]
|===

|Field
|Type
|Description

|`metadata.name`
|`string`
|Specifies the name for the address pool.
When you add a service, you can specify this pool name in the `metallb.universe.tf/address-pool` annotation to select an IP address from a specific pool.
The names `doc-example`, `silver`, and `gold` are used throughout the documentation.

|`metadata.namespace`
|`string`
|Specifies the namespace for the address pool.
Specify the same namespace that the MetalLB Operator uses.

|`spec.protocol`
|`string`
|Specifies the protocol for announcing the load balancer IP address to peer nodes.
Specify `layer2` or `bgp`.

|`spec.autoAssign`
|`boolean`
|Optional: Specifies whether MetalLB automatically assigns IP addresses from this pool.
Specify `false` if you want explicitly request an IP address from this pool with the `metallb.universe.tf/address-pool` annotation.
The default value is `true`.

|`spec.addresses`
|`array`
|Specifies a list of IP addresses for MetalLB to assign to services.
You can specify multiple ranges in a single pool.
Specify each range in CIDR notation or as starting and ending IP addresses separated with a hyphen.

|`spec.bgpAdvertisements`
|`object`
|Optional: By default, BGP mode advertises each allocated load-balancer IP address to the configured peers with no additional BGP attributes.
The peer routers receive one `/32` route for each service IP address, with the BGP local preference set to zero and no BGP communities.
Use this field to create custom advertisements.

The fields for the `bgpAdvertisements` object are defined in the following table:

.BGP advertisements configuration
[cols="1,1,3a", options="header"]
|===

|Field
|Type
|Description

|`aggregationLength`
|`integer`
|Optional: Specifies the number of bits to include in a 32-bit CIDR mask.
To aggregate the routes that the speaker advertises to BGP peers, the mask is applied to the routes for several service IP addresses and the speaker advertises the aggregated route.
For example, with an aggregation length of `24`, the speaker can aggregate several `10.0.1.x/32` service IP addresses and advertise a single `10.0.1.0/24` route.

|`aggregationLengthV6`
|`integer`
|Optional: Specifies the number of bits to include in a 128-bit CIDR mask.
For example, with an aggregation length of `124`, the speaker can aggregate several `fc00:f853:0ccd:e799::x/128` service IP addresses and advertise a single `fc00:f853:0ccd:e799::0/124` route.

|`community`
|`array`
|Optional: Specifies one or more BGP communities.
Each community is specified as two 16-bit values separated by the colon character.
Well-known communities must be specified as 16-bit values:

* `NO_EXPORT`: `65535:65281`
* `NO_ADVERTISE`: `65535:65282`
* `NO_EXPORT_SUBCONFED`: `65535:65283`

|`localPref`
|`integer`
|Optional: Specifies the local preference for this advertisement.
This BGP attribute applies to BGP sessions within the Autonomous System.
