= When expression

When expressions guard task execution by setting criteria for the execution of tasks within a pipeline. They contain a list of components that allows a task to run only when certain criteria are met. When expressions are also supported in the final set of tasks that are specified using the `finally` field in the pipeline YAML file.

The key components of a when expression are as follows:

* `input`: Specifies static inputs or variables such as a parameter, task result, and execution status. You must enter a valid input. If you do not enter a valid input, its value defaults to an empty string.
* `operator`: Specifies the relationship of an input to a set of `values`. Enter `in` or `notin` as your operator values.
* `values`: Specifies an array of string values. Enter a non-empty array of static values or variables such as parameters, results, and a bound state of a workspace.

The declared when expressions are evaluated before the task is run. If the value of a when expression is `True`, the task is run. If the value of a when expression is `False`, the task is skipped.

You can use the when expressions in various use cases. For example, whether:

* The result of a previous task is as expected.
* A file in a Git repository has changed in the previous commits.
* An image exists in the registry.
* An optional workspace is available.

The following example shows the when expressions for a pipeline run. The pipeline run will execute the `create-file` task only if the following criteria are met: the `path` parameter is `README.md`,  and the `echo-file-exists` task executed only if the `exists` result from the `check-file` task is `yes`.

<1> Specifies the type of Kubernetes object. In this example, `PipelineRun`.
<2> Task `create-file` used in the Pipeline.
<3> `when` expression that specifies to execute the `echo-file-exists` task only if the `exists` result from the `check-file` task is `yes`.
<4> `when` expression that specifies to skip the `task-should-be-skipped-1` task only if the `path` parameter is `README.md`.
<5> `when` expression that specifies to execute the `finally-task-should-be-executed` task only if the execution status of the `echo-file-exists` task and the task status is `Succeeded`, the `exists` result from the `check-file` task is `yes`, and the `path` parameter is `README.md`.

The *Pipeline Run details* page of the {product-title} web console shows the status of the tasks and when expressions as follows:

* All the criteria are met: Tasks and the when expression symbol, which is represented by a diamond shape are green.
* Any one of the criteria are not met: Task is skipped. Skipped tasks and the when expression symbol are grey.
* None of the criteria are met: Task is skipped. Skipped tasks and the when expression symbol are grey.
* Task run fails: Failed tasks and the when expression symbol are red.
