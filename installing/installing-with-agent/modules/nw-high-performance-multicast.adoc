= High performance multicast

The OpenShift SDN default Container Network Interface (CNI) network provider supports multicast between pods on the default network. This is best used for low-bandwidth coordination or service discovery, and not high-bandwidth applications.
For applications such as streaming media, like Internet Protocol television (IPTV) and multipoint videoconferencing, you can utilize Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) hardware to provide near-native performance.

When using additional SR-IOV interfaces for multicast:

* Multicast packages must be sent or received by a pod through the additional SR-IOV interface.
* The physical network which connects the SR-IOV interfaces decides the
multicast routing and topology, which is not controlled by {product-title}.
