= Reducing latency for alerting rules that do not query platform metrics

If an alerting rule for a user-defined project does not query default cluster metrics, you can deploy the rule directly on the Prometheus instance in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project. This reduces latency for alerting rules by bypassing Thanos Ruler when it is not required. This also helps to minimize the overall load on monitoring components.

[WARNING]
====
Default {product-title} metrics for user-defined projects provide information about CPU and memory usage, bandwidth statistics, and packet rate information. Those metrics cannot be included in an alerting rule if you deploy the rule directly to the Prometheus instance in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project. The procedure outlined in this section should only be used if you have read the documentation and have a comprehensive understanding of the monitoring architecture.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You are logged in as a user that has the `monitoring-rules-edit` role for the project where you want to create an alerting rule.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file for alerting rules. In this example, it is called `example-app-alerting-rule.yaml`.

. Add an alerting rule configuration to the YAML file that includes a label with the key `openshift.io/prometheus-rule-evaluation-scope` and value `leaf-prometheus`. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: example-alert
  namespace: ns1
  labels:
    openshift.io/prometheus-rule-evaluation-scope: leaf-prometheus
spec:
  groups:
  - name: example
    rules:
    - alert: VersionAlert
      expr: version{job="prometheus-example-app"} == 0
----

If that label is present, the alerting rule is deployed on the Prometheus instance in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project. If the label is not present, the alerting rule is deployed to Thanos Ruler.

. Apply the configuration file to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f example-app-alerting-rule.yaml
----
+
It takes some time to create the alerting rule.
