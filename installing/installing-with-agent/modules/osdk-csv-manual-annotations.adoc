= Operator metadata annotations

Operator developers can manually define certain annotations in the metadata of a cluster service version (CSV) to enable features or highlight capabilities in user interfaces (UIs), such as OperatorHub.

The following table lists Operator metadata annotations that can be manually defined using `metadata.annotations` fields.

.Annotations
[cols="5a,5a",options="header"]
|===
|Field |Description

|`alm-examples`
|Provide custom resource definition (CRD) templates with a minimum set of configuration. Compatible UIs pre-fill this template for users to further customize.

|`operatorframework.io/initialization-resource`
|Specify a single required custom resource that must be created at the time that the Operator is installed. Must include a template that contains a complete YAML definition.

|`operatorframework.io/suggested-namespace`
|Set a suggested namespace where the Operator should be deployed.

|`operators.openshift.io/infrastructure-features`
|Infrastructure features supported by the Operator. Users can view and filter by these features when discovering Operators through OperatorHub in the web console. Valid, case-sensitive values:

- `disconnected`: Operator supports being mirrored into disconnected catalogs, including all dependencies, and does not require internet access. All related images required for mirroring are listed by the Operator.
- `cnf`: Operator provides a Cloud-native Network Functions (CNF) Kubernetes plug-in.
- `cni`: Operator provides a Container Network Interface (CNI) Kubernetes plug-in.
- `csi`: Operator provides a Container Storage Interface (CSI) Kubernetes plug-in.
- `fips`: Operator accepts the FIPS mode of the underlying platform and works on nodes that are booted into FIPS mode.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The use of FIPS Validated / Modules in Process cryptographic libraries is only supported on {product-title} deployments on the `x86_64` architecture.
====
- `proxy-aware`: Operator supports running on a cluster behind a proxy. Operator accepts the standard proxy environment variables  `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`, which Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) provides to the Operator automatically when the cluster is configured to use a proxy. Required environment variables are passed down to Operands for managed workloads.

|`operators.openshift.io/valid-subscription`
|Free-form array for listing any specific subscriptions that are required to use the Operator. For example, `'["3Scale Commercial License", "Red Hat Managed Integration"]'`.

|`operators.operatorframework.io/internal-objects`
|Hides CRDs in the UI that are not meant for user manipulation.
