== Agent installation
Agent installation is based on the technology of Assisted Installer (AI), that is link:https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com] and the Infrastructure Operator. It is a command line tool that generates an image that runs the Assisted Service and the Assisted Installer Agent.
//TODO>>include telemetry GA

It is a subcommand that resides in the {product-title} installer and also utilizes the {product-title} installer for the input asset management.

This subcommand generates a live {op-system-first} ISO with an embedded Ignition config containing `systemd` units to start the Assisted service, Agent, network, etc. that are running in containers pulled from the {product-title} release payload.
The Agent installation utilizes Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) custom resources. ZTP allows you to provision new edge sites with declarative configurations of bare-metal equipment at remote sites.
