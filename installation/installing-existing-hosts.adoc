toc::[]


You can install {product-title} version {product-version} on existing Red Hat
Enterprise Linux (RHEL) hosts. This is a BYO, or bring-your-own hosts, installation.

You run an Ansible-based installer to establish the cluster on your hosts.

Use this option if you:

* Already have your own mechanisms for building and provisioning machines that
run RHEL
* Have your own infrastructure provisioning
* Are upgrading your {product-title} cluster
* Are willing to give up upgrade automation and the cluster’s default
self-management of nodes in exchange for more flexibility
