image:redcircle-1.png[] Meeting the *_/var/_* file system sizing requirements in
RHEL Atomic Host requires making changes to the default configuration. See
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html/managing_containers/managing_storage_with_docker_formatted_containers[Managing Storage with Docker-formatted Containers] for instructions on configuring
this during or after installation.

image:redcircle-2.png[] The system's temporary directory is determined according
to the rules defined in the
https://docs.python.org/2/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.tempdir[`*tempfile*`]
module in Python's standard library.

You must configure storage for each system that runs a container daemon. For
containerized installations, you need storage on masters. Also, by default, the
web console runs in containers on masters, and masters need storage to
run the web console. Containers run on nodes, so nodes always require storage.
The size of storage depends on workload, the number of containers, the
size of the running containers, and the containers' storage requirements.
You must also configure storage to run containerized etcd.

=== Production level hardware requirements

Test or sample environments function with the minimum requirements. For
production environments, the following recommendations apply:

Master hosts::
In a highly available {product-title} cluster with external etcd, a master host
needs to meet the minimum requirements and have 1 CPU
core and 1.5 GB of memory for each 1000 pods. Therefore, the recommended size of
a master host in an {product-title} cluster of 2000 pods is the minimum
requirements of 2 CPU cores and 16 GB of RAM, plus 2 CPU cores and 3 GB of RAM,
totaling 4 CPU cores and 19 GB of RAM.

See
xref:../scaling_performance/host_practices.adoc#scaling-performance-capacity-host-practices-master[Recommended
Practices for {product-title} Master Hosts] for performance guidance.

Node hosts::
The size of a node host depends on the expected size of its workload. As an
{product-title} cluster administrator, you need to calculate the expected
workload and add about 10 percent for overhead. For production environments,
allocate enough resources so that a node host failure does not affect your
maximum capacity.

For more information, see
xref:index.adoc#sizing[Sizing Considerations] and
xref:../scaling_performance/cluster_maximums.adoc#scaling-performance-cluster-maximums[Cluster
Limits].

[[hardware-glusterfs]]
=== {gluster} hardware requirements

include::install_config/persistent_storage/topics/glusterfs_prereqs_hardware.adoc[]

[[hardware-monitoring]]
=== Monitoring hardware requirements

The monitoring stack imposes additional system resource requirements and is
installed by default. See the
xref:../scaling_performance/scaling_cluster_monitoring.adoc#cluster-monitoring-recommendations-for-OCP[
computing resources recommendations] and the
xref:../install_config/prometheus_cluster_monitoring.adoc#overview[cluster monitoring
documentation].

[[prereq-selinux]]
=== SELinux requirements

Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) must be enabled on all of the servers before
installing {product-title} or the installer will fail. Also, configure
`SELINUX=enforcing` and `SELINUXTYPE=targeted` in the
*_/etc/selinux/config_* file:

----
# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
#     enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#     permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
#     disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
SELINUX=enforcing
# SELINUXTYPE= can take one of these three values:
#     targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
#     minimum - Modification of targeted policy. Only selected processes are protected.
#     mls - Multi Level Security protection.
SELINUXTYPE=targeted
----

[[configuring-core-usage]]
=== Optional: Configuring Core Usage

By default, {product-title} masters and nodes use all available cores in the
system they run on. You can choose the number of cores you want {product-title}
to use by setting the `*GOMAXPROCS*` environment variable. See the
link:https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#GOMAXPROCS[Go Language documentation] for
more information, including how the `*GOMAXPROCS*` environment variable works.

For example, run the following before starting the server to make
{product-title} only run on one core:

----
# export GOMAXPROCS=1
----

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Alternatively, if you plan to
getting_started/administrators.adoc#running-in-a-docker-container[run
OpenShift in a container], add `-e GOMAXPROCS=1` to the `docker run`
command when launching the server.
endif::[]

[[install-prerequisites-overlayfs]]
=== Optional: Using OverlayFS

OverlayFS is a union file system that allows you to overlay one file system on
top of another.

As of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4, you have the option to configure your
{product-title} environment to use OverlayFS. The `overlay2` graph driver is
fully supported in addition to the older `overlay` driver. However, Red Hat
recommends using `overlay2` instead of `overlay`, because of its speed and
simple implementation.

xref:../scaling_performance/optimizing_storage.adoc#comparing-overlay-graph-drivers[Comparing the Overlay Versus Overlay2 Graph Drivers]
has more information about the *overlay* and *overlay2* drivers.

See the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html-single/managing_containers/#using_the_overlay_graph_driver[Overlay Graph Driver] section of the Atomic Host documentation for instructions on how
to enable the `overlay2` graph driver for the Docker service.

[[security-warning]]
=== Security Warning

// tag::container-image-security-warning[]
{product-title} runs containers on hosts in the cluster, and in some cases, such
as build operations and the registry service, it does so using privileged
containers. Furthermore, those containers access the hosts' Docker daemon and
perform `docker build` and `docker push` operations. As such, cluster
administrators must be aware of the inherent security risks associated with
performing `docker run` operations on arbitrary images as they effectively have
root access. This is particularly relevant for `docker build` operations.

Exposure to harmful containers can be limited by assigning specific builds to
nodes so that any exposure is limited to those nodes. To do this, see the
xref:../dev_guide/builds/advanced_build_operations.adoc#dev-guide-assigning-builds-to-nodes[Assigning Builds to Specific Nodes] section of the Developer Guide. For cluster
administrators, see the
xref:../install_config/build_defaults_overrides.adoc#overview[Configuring Global Build Defaults and Overrides] topic.

You can also use
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#security-context-constraints[security
context constraints] to control the actions that a pod can perform and what it
has the ability to access. For instructions on how to enable images to run with
*USER* in the Dockerfile, see
xref:../admin_guide/manage_scc.adoc#how-do-i[Managing Security Context
Constraints] (requires a user with *cluster-admin* privileges).

For more information, see these articles:

- https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/
// end::container-image-security-warning[]

[[envirornment-requirements]]
== Environment Requirements

The following section defines the requirements of the environment containing
your {product-title} configuration. This includes networking considerations
and access to external services, such as Git repository access, storage, and
cloud infrastructure providers.

[[prereq-dns]]
=== DNS Requirements

{product-title} requires a fully functional DNS server in the environment. This
is ideally a separate host running DNS software and can provide name resolution
to hosts and containers running on the platform.

[IMPORTANT]
Adding entries into the *_/etc/hosts_* file on each host is not enough. This
file is not copied into containers running on the platform.

Key components of {product-title} run themselves inside of containers and use
the following process for name resolution:

. By default, containers receive their DNS configuration
file (*_/etc/resolv.conf_*) from their host.

. {product-title} then sets the pod's first nameserver to the IP address of
the node.

As of {product-title}
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
3.2,
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
1.2,
endif::[]
*dnsmasq* is automatically configured on all masters and nodes. The pods use the
nodes as their DNS, and the nodes forward the requests. By default, *dnsmasq*
is configured on the nodes to listen on port 53, therefore the nodes cannot run
any other type of DNS application.

[NOTE]
====
include::install/prerequisites.adoc[tag=networkmanager]

Similarly, if the `PEERDNS` parameter is set to `no` in the network script, for example, *_/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-em1_*, then the dnsmasq files are not generated, and the Ansible install will fail. Ensure the `PEERDNS` setting is set to `yes`.
====

The following is an example set of DNS records:

----
master1    A   10.64.33.100
master2    A   10.64.33.103
node1      A   10.64.33.101
node2      A   10.64.33.102
----

If you do not have a properly functioning DNS environment, you might experience
failure with:

- Product installation via the reference Ansible-based scripts
- Deployment of the infrastructure containers (registry, routers)
- Access to the {product-title} web console, because it is not accessible via
IP address alone


[[dns-config-prereq]]
==== Configuring Hosts to Use DNS

Make sure each host in your environment is configured to resolve hostnames from
your DNS server. The configuration for hosts' DNS resolution depend on whether
DHCP is enabled. If DHCP is:

- Disabled, then configure your network interface to be static, and add DNS
nameservers to NetworkManager.

- Enabled, then the NetworkManager dispatch script automatically configures DNS
based on the DHCP configuration.

To verify that hosts can be resolved by your DNS server:

. Check the contents of *_/etc/resolv.conf_*:
+
----
$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
# Generated by NetworkManager
search example.com
nameserver 10.64.33.1
# nameserver updated by /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-origin-dns.sh
----
+
In this example, 10.64.33.1 is the address of our DNS server.

. Test that the DNS servers listed in *_/etc/resolv.conf_* are able to resolve
host names to the IP addresses of all masters and nodes in your {product-title}
environment:
+
----
$ dig <node_hostname> @<IP_address> +short
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ dig master.example.com @10.64.33.1 +short
10.64.33.100
$ dig node1.example.com @10.64.33.1 +short
10.64.33.101
----

[[wildcard-dns-prereq]]
==== Configuring a DNS Wildcard

Optionally, configure a wildcard for the router to use, so that you do not need
to update your DNS configuration when new routes are added.

A wildcard for a DNS zone must ultimately resolve to the IP address of the
{product-title} xref:../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#routers[router].

For example, create a wildcard DNS entry for *cloudapps* that has a low
time-to-live value (TTL) and points to the public IP address of the host where
the router will be deployed:

----
*.cloudapps.example.com. 300 IN  A 192.168.133.2
----

[WARNING]
====
In your *_/etc/resolv.conf_* file on each node host, ensure that the DNS server
that has the wildcard entry is not listed as a nameserver or that the wildcard
domain is not listed in the search list. Otherwise, containers managed by
{product-title} might fail to resolve host names properly.
====

[[node-hostnames-prereq]]
==== Configuring Node Host Names

When you set up a cluster that is not integrated with a cloud provider, you must
correctly set your nodes' host names. Each node's host name must be resolvable,
and each node must be able to reach each other node.

To confirm that a node can reach another node:

. On one node, obtain the host name:
+
----
$ hostname

master-1.example.com
----

. On that same node, obtain the fully qualified domain name of the host:
+
----
$ hostname -f

master-1.example.com
----

. From a different node, confirm that you can reach the first node:
+
----
$ ping master-1.example.com -c 1

PING master-1.example.com (172.16.122.9) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from master-1.example.com (172.16.122.9): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.319 ms

--- master-1.example.com ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.319/0.319/0.319/0.000 ms
----

[[prereq-network-access]]
=== Network Access Requirements

A shared network must exist between the master and node hosts. If you plan to
configure
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#high-availability-masters[multiple masters for high-availability] using standard cluster installation
 process, you must also select an IP to be configured as your
 xref:../admin_guide/high_availability.adoc#virtual-ips[virtual IP] (VIP)
 during the installation process. The IP that you select must be routable
 between all of your nodes, and if you configure using a FQDN it must resolve
 on all nodes.

[[prereq-networkmanager]]
==== NetworkManager

//tag::networkmanager[]
*NetworkManager*, a program for providing detection and configuration for
systems to automatically connect to the network, is required on the nodes in
order to populate *dnsmasq* with the DNS IP addresses.

`NM_CONTROLLED` is set to `yes` by default. If `NM_CONTROLLED` is set to `no`,
then the NetworkManager dispatch script does not create the relevant
*_origin-upstream-dns.conf_* dnsmasq file, and you must configure
dnsmasq manually.
//end::networkmanager[]

[[install-config-network-using-firewalld]]
==== Configuring firewalld as the firewall

While iptables is the default firewall, firewalld is recommended for new
installations. You can enable firewalld by setting
`os_firewall_use_firewalld=true` in
xref:configuring_inventory_file.adoc#advanced-install-configuring-firewalls[the
Ansible inventory file].

----
[OSEv3:vars]
os_firewall_use_firewalld=True
----

Setting this variable to `true` opens the required ports and adds rules to the
default zone, which ensure that firewalld is configured correctly.

[NOTE]
====
Using the firewalld default configuration comes with limited configuration
options, and cannot be overridden. For example, while you can set up a storage
network with interfaces in multiple zones, the interface that nodes communicate
on must be in the default zone.
====


[[required-ports]]
==== Required Ports

The {product-title} installation automatically creates a set of internal
firewall rules on each host using
xref:../admin_guide/iptables.adoc#overview[iptables]. However, if your
network configuration uses an external firewall, such as a hardware-based
firewall, you must ensure infrastructure components can communicate with each
other through specific ports that act as communication endpoints for certain
processes or services.

Ensure the following ports required by {product-title} are open on your network
and configured to allow access between hosts. Some ports are optional depending
on your configuration and usage.

*Notes*

* In the above examples, port *4789* is used for User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
* When deployments are using the SDN, the pod network is accessed via a service
proxy, unless it is accessing the registry from the same node the registry is
deployed on.
* {product-title} internal DNS cannot be received over SDN. For non-cloud
deployments, this will default to the IP address associated with the default
route on the master host. For cloud deployments, it will default to the IP
address associated with the first internal interface as defined by the cloud
metadata.
* The master host uses port *10250* to reach the nodes and does not go over SDN.
It depends on the target host of the deployment and uses the computed value of
`*openshift_public_hostname*`.

.Aggregated Logging and Metrics
[cols='2,1,8']
|===
| *9200*
|TCP
| For Elasticsearch API use. Required to be internally open on any infrastructure
nodes so Kibana is able to retrieve logs for display. It can be externally
open for direct access to Elasticsearch by means of a route. The route can be
created using `oc expose`.

| *9300*
|TCP
| For Elasticsearch inter-cluster use. Required to be internally open on any
infrastructure node so the members of the Elasticsearch cluster might communicate
with each other.

| *9090*
| TCP
| For Prometheus API and web console use.

| *9100*
| TCP
| For the Prometheus Node-Exporter, which exports hardware and operating system metrics.
Port 9100 needs to be open on each {product-title} host in order for the Prometheus server to scrape the metrics.

| *8443*
| TCP
| For node hosts to communicate to the master API, for the node hosts to
post back status, to receive tasks, and so on. This port needs to be allowed from masters
and infra nodes to any master and node.

| *10250*
| TCP
| For the Kubernetes cAdvisor, a container resource usage and performance analysis agent.
This port must to be allowed from masters and infra nodes to any master and node.
For metrics, the source must be the infra nodes.

| *8444*
| TCP
| Port that the controller manager and scheduler services listen on.
Port 8444 must be open on each {product-title} host.

| *1936*
| TCP
| (*Optional*) Required to be open when running the template router to access
statistics. This port must be allowed from the infra nodes to any infra nodes hosting the routers
if Prometheus metrics are enabled on routers.
Can be open externally or internally to connections depending on if
you want the statistics to be expressed publicly. Can require extra
configuration to open. See the Notes section above for more information.

*Notes*

[[prereq-persistent-storage]]
=== Persistent Storage

The Kubernetes
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent volume]
framework allows you to provision an {product-title} cluster with persistent storage
using networked storage available in your environment. This can be done after
completing the initial {product-title} installation depending on your application
needs, giving users a way to request those resources without having any
knowledge of the underlying infrastructure.

The Configuring Clusters guide  provides instructions for cluster administrators
on provisioning an {product-title} cluster with persistent storage using
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_nfs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-nfs[NFS],

[[prereq-cloud-provider-considerations]]
=== Cloud Provider Considerations

There are certain aspects to take into consideration if installing {product-title}
on a cloud provider.

* For Amazon Web Services, see the xref:../install_config/configuring_aws.adoc#configuring-aws-permissions[Permissions] and the
xref:../install_config/configuring_aws.adoc#configuring-a-security-group-aws[Configuring a Security Group] sections.
* For OpenStack, see the  xref:../install_config/configuring_openstack.adoc#configuring-openstack-permissions[Permissions] and the
xref:../install_config/configuring_openstack.adoc#configuring-a-security-group-openstack[Configuring a Security Group] sections.

[[overriding-detected-ip-addresses-host-names]]
==== Overriding Detected IP Addresses and Host Names

Some deployments require that the user override the detected host names and IP
addresses for the hosts. To see the default values, change to the playbook directory and run the `*openshift_facts*`
playbook:

----
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible
$ ansible-playbook  [-i /path/to/inventory] \
  playbooks/byo/openshift_facts.yml
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
For Amazon Web Services, see the xref:../install_config/configuring_aws.adoc#overriding-detected-ip-addresses-host-names-aws[Overriding Detected IP Addresses and Host Names] section.
====


Now, verify the detected common settings. If they are not what you expect them
to be, you can override them.

The
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-ansible[Configuring Your Inventory File]
topic discusses the available Ansible variables in greater detail.

[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
|Variable |Usage

|`*hostname*`
a| - Resolves to the internal IP address from the instances themselves.

|`*ip*`
a| - The internal IP address of the instance.

|`*public_hostname*`
a| - Resolves to the external IP from hosts outside of the cloud.
- Provider `*openshift_public_hostname*` overrides.

|`*public_ip*`
a| - The externally accessible IP address associated with the instance.
- `*openshift_public_ip*` overrides.

|`*use_openshift_sdn*`
a| - For all clouds but GCE, set to `true`.
- `*openshift_use_openshift_sdn*` overrides.

==== Post-Installation Configuration for Cloud Providers

Following the installation process, you can configure {product-title} for
xref:../install_config/configuring_aws.adoc#install-config-configuring-aws[AWS],
xref:../install_config/configuring_openstack.adoc#install-config-configuring-openstack[OpenStack], or
xref:../install_config/configuring_gce.adoc#install-config-configuring-gce[GCE].
