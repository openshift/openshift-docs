//Working IA. The IA for 3.x is influx. Putting in "Installing" for now as most of the content relates to installing cert-manager, istio-csr, and then creating and installing the Istio resource.
//TP1 content. Likely structure, titles, content, etc will change for GA
//User must install cert-manager before they create and install an Istio resource. However, the spec.updateStrategy they decide on for the Istio resource dictates specific steps istio-csr and cert-manager, esp in regards to how istio-csr and cert-manager are updated.

toc::[]

The cert-manager tool is a solution for X.509 certificate management on Kubernetes. It delivers a unified API to integrate applications with private or public key infrastructure (PKI), such as Vault, Google Cloud Certificate Authority Service, Let's Encrypt, and other providers.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The cert-manager tool must be installed before you create and install your `Istio` resource.
====

The cert-manager tool ensures the certificates are valid and up-to-date by attempting to renew certificates at a configured time before they expire.

To install `istio-csr`, you must follow the `istio-csr` installation instructions for the type of update strategy you want. By default, `spec.updateStrategy` is set to `InPlace` when you create and install your `Istio` resource. You create and install your `Istio` resource after you install `istio-csr`.
