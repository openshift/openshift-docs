toc::[]

Before you install {product-title}, you must prepare the node hosts. They must
meet the following requirements.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]

[[software-prerequisites]]
== Operating system requirements

Master and node hosts must use a base installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux
(RHEL) 7.4 or later with the latest packages from the Extras
channel or RHEL Atomic Host 7.4.2 or later. See the following documentation for
the respective installation instructions, if required:

- https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/index.html[Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Installation Guide]
- https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/installation-and-configuration-guide/[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host 7 Installation and Configuration Guide]

endif::[]

[[setting-path]]
== Setting PATH

The `PATH` for the root user on each host must contain the following directories:

- *_/bin_*
- *_/sbin_*
- *_/usr/bin_*
- *_/usr/sbin_*

These directories set by default in a new RHEL 7.x installation.

[[ensuring-host-access]]
== Ensuring host access

The {product-title} installer requires a user that has access to all hosts. If
you want to run the installer as a non-root user, first configure passwordless
*sudo* rights each host:

. Generate an SSH key on the host you run the installation playbook on:
+
----
# ssh-keygen
----
+
Do *not* use a password.

. Distribute the key to the other cluster hosts. You can use a `bash` loop:
+
----
# for host in master.example.com \
    master.example.com \ <1>
    node1.example.com \  <1>
    node2.example.com; \ <1>
    do ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub $host; \
    done
----
<1> Provide the host name for each cluster host.

. Confirm that you can access each host that is listed in the loop through SSH.

[[setting-proxy-overrides]]
== Setting proxy overrides

If the *_/etc/environment_* file on your nodes contains either an `http_proxy`
or `https_proxy` value, you must also set a `no_proxy` value in that file to
allow open communication between {product-title} components.

[NOTE]
====
The `no_proxy` parameter in *_/etc/environment_* file is not the same value as
the global proxy values that you set in your inventory file. The global proxy
values configure specific {product-title} services with your proxy settings.
See
xref:configuring_inventory_file.adoc#advanced-install-configuring-global-proxy[Configuring Global Proxy Options]
for details.
====

If the *_/etc/environment_* file contains proxy values, define the following
values in the `no_proxy` parameter of that file on each node:

* Master and node host names or their domain suffix.
* Other internal host names or their domain suffix.
* Etcd IP addresses. You must provide IP addresses and not host names because *etcd* access is controlled by IP address.
* Kubernetes IP address, by default `172.30.0.1`. Must be the value set in the
xref:configuring_inventory_file.adoc#advanced-install-networking-variables-table[`openshift_portal_net`] parameter in your inventory file.
* Kubernetes internal domain suffix, `cluster.local`.
* Kubernetes internal domain suffix, `.svc`.

[NOTE]
====
Because `no_proxy` does not support CIDR, you can use domain suffixes.
====

If you use either an `http_proxy` or `https_proxy` value, your `no_proxy`
parameter value resembles the following example:

----
no_proxy=.internal.example.com,10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2,10.0.0.3,.cluster.local,.svc,localhost,127.0.0.1,172.30.0.1
----

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]

[[host-registration]]
== Registering hosts

To access the installation packages, you must register each host with Red Hat
Subscription Manager (RHSM) and attach an active {product-title} subscription.

. On each host, register with RHSM:
+
----
# subscription-manager register --username=<user_name> --password=<password>
----

. Pull the latest subscription data from RHSM:
+
----
# subscription-manager refresh
----

. List the available subscriptions:
+
----
# subscription-manager list --available --matches '*OpenShift*'
----

. In the output for the previous command, find the pool ID for an {product-title} subscription and attach it:
+
----
# subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id>
----

. Disable all yum repositories:
.. Disable all the enabled RHSM repositories:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --disable="*"
----

.. List the remaining yum repositories and note their names under `repo id`, if any:
+
----
# yum repolist
----

.. Use `yum-config-manager` to disable the remaining yum repositories:
+
----
# yum-config-manager --disable <repo_id>
----
+
Alternatively, disable all repositories:
+
----
 yum-config-manager --disable \*
----
+
Note that this might take a few minutes if you have a large number of available repositories

. Enable only the repositories required by {product-title} 3.11:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.11-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ansible-2.6-rpms"
----
endif::[]

[[installing-base-packages]]
== Installing base packages

[IMPORTANT]
====
If your hosts use RHEL 7.5 and you want to accept {product-title}'s
default *docker* configuration (using OverlayFS storage and all default logging
options), do not manually install these packages. These packages
are installed when you run the *prerequisites.yml* playbook during
xref:running_install.adoc#running-the-installation-playbooks[installation].

If your hosts use RHEL 7.4 or if they use RHEL 7.5 and you want
to customize the *docker* configuration, install these packages.
====

.For RHEL 7 systems:

. Install the following base packages:
+
----
# yum install wget git net-tools bind-utils yum-utils iptables-services bridge-utils bash-completion kexec-tools sos psacct
----

. Update the system to the latest packages:
+
----
# yum update
# reboot
----


. Install packages that are required for your installation method:
** If you plan to use the
xref:running_install.adoc#running-the-advanced-installation-system-container[containerized installer],
install the following package:
+
----
# yum install atomic
----

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
** If you plan to use the
xref:running_install.adoc#running-the-advanced-installation-rpm[RPM-based installer],
install the following package:
+
----
# yum install openshift-ansible
----
+
This package provides installer utilities and pulls in other packages that the
cluster installation process needs, such as Ansible, playbooks, and related
configuration files
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
** If you plan to use the
xref:running_install.adoc#running-the-advanced-installation-rpm[RPM-based installer]:

.. Install Ansible. To use EPEL as a package source for Ansible:

... Install the EPEL repository:
+
----
# yum -y install \
    https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
----

... Disable the EPEL repository globally so that it is not accidentally used during
later steps of the installation:
+
----
# sed -i -e "s/^enabled=1/enabled=0/" /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo
----

... Install the packages for Ansible:
+
----
# yum -y --enablerepo=epel install ansible pyOpenSSL
----

.. Clone the *openshift/openshift-ansible* repository from GitHub, which provides
the required playbooks and configuration files:
+
----
# cd ~
# git clone https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible
# cd openshift-ansible
# git checkout release-3.11
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Be sure to use the release branch of the *openshift-ansible* repository that
corresponds to your {product-title} version. Use the *master* branch to install
the version of {product-title} in development.
====
endif::[]

.For RHEL Atomic Host 7 systems:

. Ensure the host is up to date by upgrading to the latest Atomic tree if one is
available:
+
----
# atomic host upgrade
----

. After the upgrade is completed and prepared for the next boot, reboot the
host:
+
----
# reboot
----

[[installing-docker]]
== Installing Docker

At this point, install Docker on all master and node hosts. This
allows you to configure your xref:configuring-docker-storage[Docker storage
options] before you install {product-title}.

[NOTE]
====
The cluster installation process automatically modifies
the *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* file.
====

.For RHEL 7 systems:

. Install Docker 1.13:
+
----
# yum install docker-1.13.1
----

. Verify that version 1.13 was installed:
+
----
# rpm -V docker-1.13.1
# docker version
----

.For RHEL Atomic Host 7 systems:
No action is required. Docker is installed, configured, and running by default.

[[configuring-docker-storage]]
== Configuring Docker Storage

Containers and the images they are created from are stored in Docker's storage
back end. This storage is ephemeral and separate from any
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/index.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-index[persistent
storage] allocated to meet the needs of your applications. With _Ephemeral
storage_, container-saved data is lost when the container is removed. With
_persistent storage_, container-saved data remains if the container is removed.

You must configure storage for all master and node hosts because by default each
system runs a container daemon. For containerized installations, you need
storage on masters. Also, by default, the web console and etcd, which require
storage, run in containers on masters. Containers run on nodes, so storage is
always required on them.

The size of storage depends on workload, number of containers, the
size of the containers being run, and the containers' storage requirements.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If your hosts use RHEL 7.5 and you want to accept {product-title}'s
default *docker* configuration (using OverlayFS storage and all default logging
options), do not manually install these packages. These packages
are installed when you run the *prerequisites.yml* playbook during
xref:running_install.adoc#running-the-installation-playbooks[installation].

If your hosts use RHEL 7.4 or if they use RHEL 7.5 and you want
to customize the *docker* configuration, install these packages.
====

.For RHEL 7 systems:

The default storage back end for Docker on RHEL 7 is a thin pool on loopback
devices, which is not supported for production use and only appropriate for
proof of concept environments. For production environments, you must create a
thin pool logical volume and re-configure Docker to use that volume.

Docker stores images and containers in a graph driver, which is a pluggable storage technology, such as *DeviceMapper*,
*OverlayFS*, and *Btrfs*. Each has advantages and disadvantages. For example, OverlayFS is faster than DeviceMapper
at starting and stopping containers but is not Portable Operating System Interface for Unix (POSIX) compliant
because of the architectural limitations of a union file system. See the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/?version=7[Red Hat Enterprise Linux] release notes
for information on using OverlayFS with your version of RHEL.

For more information about the benefits and limitations of DeviceMapper and OverlayFS,
see xref:../scaling_performance/optimizing_storage.adoc#choosing-a-graph-driver[Choosing a Graph Driver].

.For RHEL Atomic Host 7 systems:

The default storage back end for Docker on RHEL Atomic Host is a thin pool
logical volume, which is supported for production environments. You must ensure
that enough space is allocated for this volume per the Docker storage
requirements mentioned in
xref:prerequisites.adoc#system-requirements[System
Requirements].

If you do not have enough space allocated, see
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html-single/managing_containers/#managing_storage_with_docker_formatted_containers[Managing Storage with Docker Formatted Containers]
for details about using *docker-storage-setup* and basic instructions on storage
management in RHEL Atomic Host.


[[configuring-docker-overlayfs]]
=== Configuring OverlayFS

OverlayFS is a type of union file system. It allows you to overlay one file system on top of another.
Changes are recorded in the upper file system, while the lower file system remains unmodified.

xref:../scaling_performance/optimizing_storage.adoc#comparing-overlay-graph-drivers[Comparing the Overlay Versus Overlay2 Graph Drivers]
has more information about the *overlay* and *overlay2* drivers.

For information about enabling the OverlayFS storage driver for the Docker service, see the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html-single/managing_containers/#using_the_overlay_graph_driver[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host documentation].


[[configuring-docker-thin-pool]]
=== Configuring thin pool storage

You can use the *docker-storage-setup* script included with Docker to create a
thin pool device and configure Docker's storage driver. You can do this after
you install Docker and must do it before you create images or containers. The
script reads configuration options from the
*_/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup_* file and supports three options for
creating the logical volume:

- Use an additional block device.
- Use an existing, specified volume group.
- Use the remaining free space from the volume group where your root
file system is located.

Using an additional block device is the most robust option, but it requires adding another
block device to your host before you configure Docker storage. The other options
both require leaving free space available when you provision your host. Using
the remaining free space in the root file system volume group
is known to cause issues with some applications, for example Red Hat Mobile
Application Platform (RHMAP).

. Create the *docker-pool* volume using one of the following three options:

** To use an additional block device:
.. *_/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup_*, set *DEVS* to the path of the block
device to use. Set *VG* to the volume group name to create, such as
*docker-vg*. For example:
+
----
# cat <<EOF > /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup
DEVS=/dev/vdc
VG=docker-vg
EOF
----
.. Run *docker-storage-setup* and review the output to ensure the
*docker-pool* volume was created:
+
----
# docker-storage-setup                                                                                                                                                                                                                                [5/1868]

[[reconfiguring-docker-storage]]
=== Reconfiguring Docker storage

If you need to reconfigure Docker storage after you create the
*docker-pool*:

. Remove the *docker-pool* logical volume.

. If you use a dedicated volume group, remove the volume group and
any associated physical volumes

. Run *docker-storage-setup* again.

See
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Logical_Volume_Manager_Administration/index.html[Logical Volume Manager Administration]
for more detailed information about LVM management.

[[enabling-image-signature-support]]
=== Enabling image signature support

{product-title} is capable of cryptographically verifying that images are from
trusted sources. The
xref:../security/deployment.adoc#security-deployment-from-where-images-deployed[Container Security Guide]
provides a high-level description of how image signing works.

You can configure image signature verification using the `atomic` command line
interface (CLI), version 1.12.5 or greater.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The `atomic` CLI is pre-installed on RHEL Atomic Host systems.

[NOTE]
====
For more on the `atomic` CLI, see the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html/cli_reference/prerequisites[Atomic CLI documentation].
====
endif::[]

The following files and directories comprise the trust configuration of a host:

- *_/etc/containers/registries.d/*_*
- *_/etc/containers/policy.json_*

You can manage trust configuration directly on each node or manage the files on
a separate host distribute them to the appropriate nodes using
Ansible, for example. See the
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2750891#automating-cluster-configuration[Container
Image Signing Integration Guide] for an example of automating file distribution
with Ansible.

. Install the *atomic* package if it is not installed on the host system:
+
----
$ yum install atomic
----

. View the current trust configuration:
+
----
$ atomic trust show
* (default)                         accept
----
+
The default configuration is to whitelist all registries, which means that no
signature verification is configured.

. Customize your trust configuration. In the following example, you whitelist
one registry or namespace, blacklist (reject) untrusted registries, and require signature
verification on a vendor registry:
+
----
$ atomic trust add --type insecureAcceptAnything 172.30.1.1:5000

----

. Optionally, review the `atomic` man page `man atomic-trust` for more configuration
options.

[[managing-docker-container-logs]]
=== Managing container logs

To prevent a container's log file, the
*_/var/lib/docker/containers/<hash>/<hash>-json.log_* file on the node where the
container is running, from increasing to a problematic size, you can
configure Docker's `json-file` logging driver to restrict the size and number
of log files.

[options="header"]
|===

|Option |Purpose

|`--log-opt max-size`
|Sets the size at which a new log file is created.

|`--log-opt max-file`
|Sets the maximum number of log files to be kept per host.
|===

. To configure the log file, edit the *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* file. For
example, to set the maximum file size to 1 MB and always keep the last three
log files, set the following options:
+
----
OPTIONS='--insecure-registry=172.30.0.0/16 --selinux-enabled --log-opt max-size=1M --log-opt max-file=3'
----
+
See Docker's documentation for additional information on how to
link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/#/options[configure logging drivers].

. Restart the Docker service:
+
----
# systemctl restart docker
----

[[viewing-available-container-logs]]
=== Viewing available container logs

You can view the container logs in the *_/var/lib/docker/containers/<hash>/_*
directory on the node where the container is running. For example:
----
# ls -lh /var/lib/docker/containers/f088349cceac173305d3e2c2e4790051799efe363842fdab5732f51f5b001fd8/

[[blocking-local-volume-usage]]
=== Blocking local volume usage

When a volume is provisioned using the `VOLUME` instruction in a *_Dockerfile_*
or using the `docker run -v <volumename>` command, a host's storage space is
used. Using this storage can lead to an unexpected out of space issue and can
bring down the host.

In {product-title}, users trying to run their own images risk filling the entire
storage space on a node host. One solution to this issue is to prevent users
from running images with volumes. This way, the only storage a user has access
to can be limited, and the cluster administrator can assign storage quota.

Using *docker-novolume-plugin* solves this issue by disallowing starting a
container with local volumes defined. In particular, the plug-in blocks `docker run`
commands that contain:

- The `--volumes-from` option
- Images that have `VOLUME`(s) defined
- References to existing volumes that were provisioned with the `docker volume`
command

The plug-in does not block references to bind mounts.

To enable *docker-novolume-plugin*, perform the following steps on each node
host:

. Install the *docker-novolume-plugin* package:
+
----
$ yum install docker-novolume-plugin
----

. Enable and start the *docker-novolume-plugin* service:
+
----
$ systemctl enable docker-novolume-plugin
$ systemctl start docker-novolume-plugin
----

. Edit the *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* file and append the following to the
`OPTIONS` list:
+
----
--authorization-plugin=docker-novolume-plugin
----

. Restart the *docker* service:
+
----
$ systemctl restart docker
----

After you enable this plug-in, containers with local volumes defined fail to
start and show the following error message:

----
runContainer: API error (500): authorization denied by plugin
docker-novolume-plugin: volumes are not allowed
----
