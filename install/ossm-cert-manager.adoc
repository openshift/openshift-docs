//User must install cert-manager before they create and install an Istio resource. However, the spec.updateStrategy they decide on for the Istio resource dictates specific steps istio-csr and cert-manager, esp in regards to how istio-csr and cert-manager are updated.

toc::[]

The cert-manager tool is a solution for X.509 certificate management on Kubernetes. It delivers a unified API to integrate applications with private or public key infrastructure (PKI), such as Vault, Google Cloud Certificate Authority Service, Let's Encrypt, and other providers.

The cert-manager tool ensures that the certificates are valid and up-to-date by attempting to renew certificates at a configured time before they expire.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The cert-manager tool must be installed before you create and install your `Istio` resource.
