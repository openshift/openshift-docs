Escaping special characters in ansible variables file

This module included in the following assemblies:
* install_config/configuring_openstack.adoc
* install/configuring_inventory_files.adoc
////

[IMPORTANT]
====
If a parameter value in the Ansible inventory file contains special characters,
such as `pass:[#]`, `{` or `}`, you must double-escape the value (that is
enclose the value in both single and double quotation marks). For example, to
use `pass:[mypasswordwith###hashsigns]` as a value for the variable
`openshift_cloudprovider_openstack_password`, declare it as
`openshift_cloudprovider_openstack_password='"mypasswordwith###hashsigns"'` in
the Ansible host inventory file.
