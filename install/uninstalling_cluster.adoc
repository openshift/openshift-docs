You can uninstall {product-title} hosts in your cluster by running the
*_uninstall.yml_* playbook. This playbook deletes {product-title} content
installed by Ansible, including:

- Configuration
- Containers
- Default templates and image streams
- Images
- RPM packages

The playbook deletes content for any hosts defined in the inventory file
that you specify when running the playbook.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you uninstall your cluster, review the following list of scenarios and
make sure that uninstalling is the best option:

* If your installation process failed and you want to continue the process,
you can
xref:../install/running_install.adoc#advanced-retrying-installation[retry the installation].
The installation playbooks are designed so that if they fail to install your
cluster, you can run them again without needing to uninstall the cluster.
* If you want to restart a failed installation from the beginning, you can
uninstall the {product-title} hosts in your cluster by running the
*_uninstall.yml_* playbook, as described in the following section. This playbook
only uninstalls the {product-title} assets for the most recent version that you
installed.
* If you must change the host names or certificate names, you must recreate
your certificates before retrying installation by running the *_uninstall.yml_*
playbook. Running the installation playbooks again will not recreate the
certificates.
* If you want to repurpose hosts that you installed {product-title} on earlier,
such as with a proof-of-concept installation, or want to install a different
minor or asynchronous version of {product-title} you must reimage the hosts
before you use them in a production cluster. After you run the *_uninstall.yml_*
playbooks, some host assets might remain in an altered state.

[[uninstalling]]
= Uninstalling a {product-title} cluster

To uninstall
{product-title} across all hosts in your cluster, change to the playbook directory and run the playbook using the
inventory file you used most recently:

----
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# ansible-playbook [-i /path/to/file] \ <1>
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/adhoc/uninstall.yml
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# ansible-playbook [-i /path/to/file] \ <1>
    ~/openshift-ansible/playbooks/adhoc/uninstall.yml
endif::[]
----
<1> If your inventory file is not in the *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* directory,
specify `-i` and the path to the inventory file.

[[uninstalling-nodes]]
=== Uninstalling nodes

To uninstall node components from specific hosts using the
*_uninstall.yml_* playbook while leaving the remaining hosts and cluster alone:

[WARNING]
====
Use this method only when attempting to uninstall specific node hosts, not
specific masters or etcd hosts. Uninstalling master or etcd hosts requires
more configuration changes in the cluster.
====

. Follow the steps in
xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#deleting-nodes[Deleting Nodes] to
remove the node object from the cluster.

. Create a different inventory file that references only those hosts. For
example, to delete content from only one node:
+
----
[OSEv3:children]
nodes <1>

[OSEv3:vars]
ansible_ssh_user=root
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
openshift_deployment_type=openshift-enterprise
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
openshift_deployment_type=origin
endif::[]

[nodes]
node3.example.com openshift_node_group_name='node-config-infra' <2>
----
<1> Include only the sections that apply to the hosts to uninstall.
<2> Include only the hosts to uninstall.

. Change to the playbook directory and run the *_uninstall.yml_* playbook:
+
----
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# ansible-playbook -i /path/to/new/file \ <1>
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/adhoc/uninstall.yml
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# ansible-playbook -i /path/to/new/file \ <1>
    ~/openshift-ansible/playbooks/adhoc/uninstall.yml
endif::[]
----
<1> Specify the path to the new inventory file.

When the playbook completes, all {product-title} content is removed from
the specified hosts.
