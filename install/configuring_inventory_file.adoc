[[configuring-ansible]]
== Customizing Inventory Files for Your Cluster

Ansible inventory files describe the details about the hosts in your cluster, as
well as the cluster configuration details for your {product-title}
installation. The {product-title} installation playbooks read your inventory
file to know where and how to install {product-title} across your set of hosts.

[NOTE]
====
See link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.4/intro_inventory.html[Ansible documentation]
for details on the format of an inventory file, including basics
on link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.4/YAMLSyntax.html[YAML syntax].
====

When you install the *openshift-ansible-utils* RPM package as described in
xref:host_preparation.adoc#installing-base-packages[Host Preparation], Ansible
dependencies create a file at the default location of *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*.
However, the file is simply the default Ansible example and has no variables
related specifically to {product-title} configuration. To successfully install
{product-title}, you _must_ replace the default contents of the file with your
own desired configuration per your cluster topography and requirements.

The following sections describe commonly used variables to set in your inventory
file during cluster installation. Many of the Ansible variables described
are optional. Accepting the default values for required variables should suffice
for development environments, but for production environments, it is recommended
you read through and become familiar with the various options available.

You can review
xref:example_inventories.adoc#install-config-example-inventories[Example Inventory Files]
for various examples to use as a starting point for your cluster installation.

[NOTE]
====
Images require a version number policy in order to maintain updates. See
the xref:../architecture/core_concepts/containers_and_images.adoc#architecture-images-tag-policy[Image
Version Tag Policy] section in the Architecture Guide for more information.
====

[[configuring-cluster-variables]]
== Configuring Cluster Variables

To assign environment variables during the Ansible install that apply more
globally to your {product-title} cluster overall, indicate the desired variables in
the *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file on separate, single lines within the *[OSEv3:vars]*
section. For example:

----
[OSEv3:vars]

openshift_master_identity_providers=[{'name': 'htpasswd_auth',
'login': 'true', 'challenge': 'true',
'kind': 'HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider',}]

openshift_master_default_subdomain=apps.test.example.com
----

include::install/topics/escaping_special_characters.adoc[]

The following tables describe variables for use with the Ansible installer that
can be assigned cluster-wide:

[[cluster-variables-table]]
.General Cluster Variables
[cols=".^5,.^5a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable |Purpose

|`ansible_ssh_user`
|This variable sets the SSH user for the installer to use and defaults to
`root`. This user should allow SSH-based authentication
xref:host_preparation.adoc#ensuring-host-access[without requiring a password]. If
using SSH key-based authentication, then the key should be managed by an SSH
agent.

|`ansible_become`
|If `ansible_ssh_user` is not `root`, this variable must be set to `true` and
the user must be configured for passwordless `sudo`.

|`debug_level`
a|This variable sets which INFO messages are logged to the `systemd-journald.service`. Set one of the following:

* `0` to log errors and warnings only
* `2` to log normal information (This is the default level.)
* `4` to log debugging-level information
* `6` to log API-level debugging information (request / response)
* `8` to log body-level API debugging information

For more information on debug log levels, see xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-node-config-logging-levels[Configuring Logging Levels].

|`containerized`
|If set to `true`, containerized {product-title} services are run on all target master
and node hosts in the cluster instead of installed using RPM packages. If set to
`false` or unset, the default RPM method is used. RHEL Atomic Host requires the
containerized method, and is automatically selected for you based on the
detection of the *_/run/ostree-booted_* file. See
xref:index.adoc#planning-installation-types[Installing on
Containerized Hosts] for more details.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Containerized installations are supported starting in {product-title} 3.1.1.
endif::[]

|`openshift_clock_enabled`
a| Whether to enable Network Time Protocol (NTP) on cluster nodes. `true` by default.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To prevent masters and nodes in the
cluster from going out of sync, do not change the default value of this parameter.
====

|`openshift_master_admission_plugin_config`
a|This variable sets the parameter and arbitrary JSON values as per the requirement in your inventory hosts file.

xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-node-config-audit-config[Audit
Configuration] for more information.

|`openshift_master_cluster_hostname`
|This variable overrides the host name for the cluster, which defaults to the
host name of the master.

|`openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname`
|This variable overrides the public host name for the cluster, which defaults to
the host name of the master.

|`openshift_master_cluster_method`
|Optional. This variable defines the HA method when deploying multiple masters.
Supports the `native` method. See xref:example_inventories.adoc#multiple-masters[Multiple Masters] for
more information.

|`openshift_rolling_restart_mode`
|This variable enables rolling restarts of HA masters (i.e., masters are taken
down one at a time) when
upgrading/automated_upgrades.adoc#install-config-upgrading-automated-upgrades[running
the upgrade playbook directly]. It defaults to `services`, which allows rolling
restarts of services on the masters. It can instead be set to `system`, which
enables rolling, full system restarts.

|`openshift_master_identity_providers`
|This variable sets the
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#install-config-configuring-authentication[identity provider].
The default value is
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider[Deny
All]. If you use a supported identity provider, configure {product-title} to
use it.

|`openshift_master_named_certificates`
.2+.^|These variables are used to configure xref:../install_config/certificate_customization.adoc#install-config-certificate-customization[custom certificates] which are deployed as part of the installation. See xref:advanced-install-custom-certificates[Configuring Custom Certificates] for more information.
|`openshift_master_overwrite_named_certificates`

|`openshift_hosted_router_certificate`

for the hosted router.

|`openshift_hosted_registry_cert_expire_days`
|Validity of the auto-generated registry certificate in days. Defaults to `730` (2 years).

|`openshift_ca_cert_expire_days`
|Validity of the auto-generated CA certificate in days. Defaults to `1825` (5 years).

|`openshift_node_cert_expire_days`
|Validity of the auto-generated node certificate in days. Defaults to `730` (2 years).

|`openshift_master_cert_expire_days`
|Validity of the auto-generated master certificate in days. Defaults to `730` (2 years).

|`etcd_ca_default_days`
|Validity of the auto-generated external etcd certificates in days. Controls
validity for etcd CA, peer, server and client certificates. Defaults to `1825`
(5 years).

|`os_firewall_use_firewalld`
|Set to `true` to use firewalld instead of the default iptables. Not available on RHEL Atomic Host. See the xref:advanced-install-configuring-firewalls[Configuring the Firewall] section for more information.

|`openshift_master_session_name`
.4+.^|These variables override defaults for
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#session-options[session
options] in the OAuth configuration. See xref:advanced-install-session-options[Configuring Session Options] for more information.

|`openshift_master_session_max_seconds`

|`openshift_master_session_auth_secrets`

|`openshift_master_session_encryption_secrets`

|`openshift_set_node_ip`
|This variable configures `nodeIP` in the node configuration. This variable is needed in cases where it is desired for node traffic to go over an interface other than the default network interface. The host variable `openshift_ip` can also be configured on each node to set a specific IP that might not be the IP of the default route.

|`openshift_master_image_policy_config`
|Sets `imagePolicyConfig` in the master configuration. See xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-config-image-config[Image Configuration] for details.

|`openshift_router_selector`
|Default node selector for automatically deploying router pods. See
xref:configuring-node-host-labels[Configuring Node Host Labels] for details.

|`openshift_registry_selector`
|Default node selector for automatically deploying registry pods. See
xref:configuring-node-host-labels[Configuring Node Host Labels] for details.

|`openshift_template_service_broker_namespaces`
|This variable enables the template service broker by specifying one or more
namespaces whose templates will be served by the broker.

|`osm_default_node_selector`
|This variable overrides the node selector that projects will use by default when
placing pods, which is defined by the `projectConfig.defaultNodeSelector` field
in the master configuration file. Starting in {product-title} 3.9, this defaults
to `node-role.kubernetes.io/compute=true` if undefined.

|`openshift_docker_additional_registries`
a|{product-title} adds the specified additional registry or registries to the
*docker* configuration. These are the registries to search.
If the registry required to access the registry is other than `80` include the port number required.

For example:

----
openshift_docker_additional_registries=example.com:443
----

[NOTE]
====
If you need to configure your cluster to use an alternate registry, set
`oreg_url` rather than rely on `openshift_docker_additional_registries`.
====

|`openshift_docker_insecure_registries`
|{product-title} adds the specified additional insecure registry or registries to
the *docker* configuration. For any of these registries, secure sockets layer
(SSL) is not verified.

|`openshift_docker_blocked_registries`
|{product-title} adds the specified blocked registry or registries to the
*docker* configuration. Block the listed registries. Setting this to `all`
blocks everything not in the other variables.

|`openshift_metrics_hawkular_hostname`
|This variable sets the host name for integration with the metrics console by
overriding `metricsPublicURL` in the master configuration for cluster metrics.
If you alter this variable, ensure the host name is accessible via your router.
See xref:advanced-install-cluster-metrics[Configuring Cluster Metrics] for
details.

|`openshift_clusterid`
|This variable is a cluster identifier unique to the AWS Availability Zone. Using this avoids potential issues in Amazon Web Service
(AWS) with multiple zones or multiple clusters. See xref:../install_config/configuring_aws.adoc#aws-cluster-labeling[Labeling Clusters for AWS] for details.

|`openshift_image_tag`
|Use this variable to specify a container image tag to install or configure.

|`openshift_pkg_version`
|Use this variable to specify an RPM version to install or configure.

|===

[WARNING]
====
If you modify the `openshift_image_tag` or the `openshift_pkg_version` variables
after the cluster is set up, then an upgrade can be triggered, resulting in
downtime.

* If `openshift_image_tag` is set, its value is used for all hosts in
containerized environments, even those that have another version installed. If
* `openshift_pkg_version` is set, its value is used for all hosts in RPM-based
environments, even those that have another version installed.
====

[[advanced-install-networking-variables-table]]
.Networking Variables
[options="header"]
|===

|Variable |Purpose

|`openshift_master_default_subdomain`
|This variable overrides the default subdomain to use for exposed
xref:../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-routes[routes].

|`os_sdn_network_plugin_name`
|This variable configures which
xref:../architecture/networking/sdn.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-sdn[OpenShift SDN plug-in] to
use for the pod network, which defaults to `redhat/openshift-ovs-subnet` for the
standard SDN plug-in. Set the variable to `redhat/openshift-ovs-multitenant` to
use the multitenant SDN plug-in.

|`osm_cluster_network_cidr`
|This variable overrides the SDN cluster network CIDR block. This is the network
from which pod IPs are assigned. This network block should be a private block
and must not conflict with existing network blocks in your infrastructure to
which pods, nodes, or the master may require access. Defaults to `10.128.0.0/14`
and cannot be arbitrarily re-configured after deployment, although certain
changes to it can be made in the
xref:../install_config/configuring_sdn.adoc#configuring-the-pod-network-on-masters[SDN
master configuration].

|`openshift_portal_net`
|This variable configures the subnet in which
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[services]
will be created within the
xref:../architecture/networking/sdn.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-sdn[{product-title}
SDN]. This network block should be private and must not conflict with any
existing network blocks in your infrastructure to which pods, nodes, or the
master may require access to, or the installation will fail. Defaults to
`172.30.0.0/16`, and cannot be re-configured after deployment. If changing from the default, avoid `172.17.0.0/16`, which the *docker0* network bridge uses by default, or modify the *docker0* network.

|`osm_host_subnet_length`
|This variable specifies the size of the per host subnet allocated for pod IPs
by
xref:../architecture/networking/sdn.adoc#sdn-design-on-masters[{product-title}
SDN]. Defaults to `9` which means that a subnet of size /23 is allocated to each
host; for example, given the default 10.128.0.0/14 cluster network, this will
allocate 10.128.0.0/23, 10.128.2.0/23, 10.128.4.0/23, and so on. This cannot be
re-configured after deployment.

|`openshift_node_proxy_mode`
|This variable specifies the
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#service-proxy-mode[service
proxy mode] to use: either `iptables` for the default, pure-`iptables`
implementation, or `userspace` for the user space proxy.

|`openshift_use_flannel`
|This variable enables *flannel* as an alternative networking layer instead of
the default SDN. If enabling *flannel*, disable the default SDN with the
`openshift_use_openshift_sdn` variable. For more information, see xref:../install_config/configuring_sdn.adoc#using-flannel[Using Flannel].

|`openshift_use_openshift_sdn`
|Set to `false` to disable the OpenShift SDN plug-in.

|===

[[advanced-install-deployment-types]]
== Configuring Deployment Type

Various defaults used throughout the playbooks and roles used by the installer
are based on the deployment type configuration (usually defined in an Ansible
inventory file).

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Ensure the `openshift_deployment_type` parameter in your inventory file's `[OSEv3:vars]`
section is set to `openshift-enterprise` to install the {product-title} variant:

----
[OSEv3:vars]
openshift_deployment_type=openshift-enterprise
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Ensure the `openshift_deployment_type` parameter in your inventory file's `[OSEv3:vars]`
section is set to `origin` to install the {product-title} variant:

----
[OSEv3:vars]
openshift_deployment_type=origin
----
endif::[]


[[configuring-host-variables]]
== Configuring Host Variables

To assign environment variables to hosts during the Ansible installation, indicate
the desired variables in the *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file after the host entry in
the *[masters]* or *[nodes]* sections. For example:

----
[masters]
ec2-52-6-179-239.compute-1.amazonaws.com openshift_public_hostname=ose3-master.public.example.com
----

The following table describes variables for use with the Ansible installer that
can be assigned to individual host entries:

[[advanced-host-variables]]
.Host Variables
[options="header"]
|===

|Variable |Purpose

|`openshift_hostname`
|This variable overrides the internal cluster host name for the system. Use this
when the system's default IP address does not resolve to the system host name.

|`openshift_public_hostname`
|This variable overrides the system's public host name. Use this for cloud
installations, or for hosts on networks using a network address translation
(NAT).

|`openshift_ip`
|This variable overrides the cluster internal IP address for the system. Use this
when using an interface that is not configured with the default
route.`openshift_ip` can be used for etcd.

|`openshift_public_ip`
|This variable overrides the system's public IP address. Use this for cloud
installations, or for hosts on networks using a network address translation
(NAT).

|`containerized`
|If set to *true*, containerized {product-title} services are run on the target master and
node hosts instead of installed using RPM packages. If set to *false* or unset,
the default RPM method is used. RHEL Atomic Host requires the containerized
method, and is automatically selected for you based on the detection of the
*_/run/ostree-booted_* file. See
xref:index.adoc#planning-installation-types[Installing on Containerized Hosts] for more details.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Containerized installations are supported starting in {product-title} 3.1.1.
endif::[]

|`openshift_node_labels`
|This variable adds labels to nodes during installation. See
xref:configuring-node-host-labels[Configuring Node Host Labels] for more
details.

|`openshift_node_kubelet_args`
|This variable is used to configure `kubeletArguments` on nodes, such as
arguments used in xref:../admin_guide/garbage_collection.adoc#admin-guide-garbage-collection[container and
image garbage collection], and to
xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#configuring-node-resources[specify
resources per node]. `kubeletArguments` are key value pairs that are passed
directly to the Kubelet that match the
https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kubelet/[Kubelet's command line
arguments]. `kubeletArguments` are not migrated or validated and may become
invalid if used. These values override other settings in node configuration
which may cause invalid configurations. Example usage:
*{'image-gc-high-threshold': ['90'],'image-gc-low-threshold': ['80']}*.

|`openshift_docker_options`
a|This variable configures additional `docker` options within
*_/etc/sysconfig/docker_*, such as options used in
xref:host_preparation.adoc#managing-docker-container-logs[Managing Container Logs].
It is recommended to use `json-file`.

The following example shows the configuration of Docker to use the `json-file` log
driver, where Docker will rotate between three 1 MB log files:
----
"--log-driver json-file --log-opt max-size=1M --log-opt max-file=3"
----

|`openshift_schedulable`
|This variable configures whether the host is marked as a schedulable node,
meaning that it is available for placement of new pods. See
xref:marking-masters-as-unschedulable-nodes[Configuring Schedulability on Masters].

|`openshift_node_problem_detector_install`
|This variable is used to activate the xref:../admin_guide/node_problem_detector.adoc#admin-guide-node-problem-detector[Node Problem Detector].
If set to `false, the default`, the Node Problem Detector is not installed or started.
|===

[[configuring-host-port]]
== Configuring Master API Port

To configure the default ports used by the master API, configure the following
variables in the *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file:

[[advanced-master-ports]]
.Master API Port
[options="header"]
|===

|Variable |Purpose
|`openshift_master_api_port`
|This variable sets the port number to access the {product-title} API.
|===

For example:

----
openshift_master_api_port=3443
----

The web console port setting (`openshift_master_console_port`) must match the
API server port (`openshift_master_api_port`).

[[configuring-cluster-pre-install-checks]]
== Configuring Cluster Pre-install Checks

Pre-install checks are a set of diagnostic tasks that run as part of the
*openshift_health_checker* Ansible role. They run prior to an Ansible
installation of {product-title}, ensure that required inventory values are set,
and identify potential issues on a host that can prevent or interfere with a
successful installation.

The following table describes available pre-install checks that will run before
every Ansible installation of {product-title}:

[[configuring-cluster-pre-install-checks-pre-install-checks]]
.Pre-install Checks
[options="header"]
|===

|Check Name |Purpose

|`memory_availability`
|This check ensures that a host has the recommended amount of memory for the
specific deployment of {product-title}. Default values have been derived from
the
xref:prerequisites.adoc#system-requirements[latest
installation documentation]. A user-defined value for minimum memory
requirements may be set by setting the `openshift_check_min_host_memory_gb`
cluster variable in your inventory file.

|`disk_availability`
|This check only runs on etcd, master, and node hosts. It ensures that the mount
path for an {product-title} installation has sufficient disk space remaining.
Recommended disk values are taken from the
xref:prerequisites.adoc#system-requirements[latest
installation documentation]. A user-defined value for minimum disk space
requirements may be set by setting `openshift_check_min_host_disk_gb` cluster
variable in your inventory file.

|`docker_storage`
|Only runs on hosts that depend on the *docker* daemon (nodes and containerized
installations). Checks that *docker*'s total usage does not exceed a
user-defined limit. If no user-defined limit is set, *docker*'s maximum usage
threshold defaults to 90% of the total size available. The threshold limit for
total percent usage can be set with a variable in your inventory file:
`max_thinpool_data_usage_percent=90`. A user-defined limit for maximum thinpool
usage may be set by setting the `max_thinpool_data_usage_percent` cluster
variable in your inventory file.

|`docker_storage_driver`
|Ensures that the *docker* daemon is using a storage driver supported by
{product-title}. If the `devicemapper` storage driver is being used, the check
additionally ensures that a loopback device is not being used. For more
information, see
link:https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/device-mapper-driver/[Docker's
Use the Device Mapper Storage Driver guide].

|`docker_image_availability`
|Attempts to ensure that images required by an {product-title} installation are
available either locally or in at least one of the configured container image
registries on the host machine.

|`package_version`
|Runs on `yum`-based systems determining if multiple releases of a required
{product-title} package are available. Having multiple releases of a package
available during an `enterprise` installation of OpenShift suggests that there
are multiple `yum` repositories enabled for different releases, which may lead
to installation problems. This check is skipped if the `openshift_release`
variable is not defined in the inventory file.

|`package_availability`
|Runs prior to non-containerized installations of {product-title}. Ensures that
RPM packages required for the current installation are available.

|`package_update`
|Checks whether a `yum` update or package installation will succeed, without
actually performing it or running `yum` on the host.
|===

To disable specific pre-install checks, include the variable
`openshift_disable_check` with a comma-delimited list of check names in your
inventory file. For example:

----
openshift_disable_check=memory_availability,disk_availability
----

[NOTE]
====
A similar set of health checks meant to run for diagnostics on existing clusters
can be found in
xref:../admin_guide/diagnostics_tool.adoc#admin-guide-health-checks-via-ansible-playbook[Ansible-based Health Checks]. Another set of checks for checking certificate expiration can be
found in
xref:../install_config/redeploying_certificates.adoc#install-config-redeploying-certificates[Redeploying Certificates].
====

[[advanced-install-configuring-system-containers]]
== Configuring System Containers

System containers provide a way to containerize services that need to run before
the `docker` daemon is running. They are Docker-formatted containers that use:

- link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.2/html/content_management_guide/managing_ostree_content[OSTree] for storage,
- link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html-single/managing_containers/#running_containers_with_runc[runC] for the runtime,
- link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html-single/managing_containers/#using_systemd_with_containers[systemd] for service management, and
- link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html-single/managing_containers/#using_skopeo_to_work_with_container_registries[skopeo] for searching.

System containers are therefore stored and run outside of the traditional
`docker` service. For more details on system container technology, see
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html/managing_containers/running_system_containers[Running System Containers] in the _Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host: Managing Containers_ documentation.

You can configure your {product-title} installation to run certain components as
system containers instead of their RPM or standard containerized methods.
Currently, the `docker` and etcd components can be run as system containers in
{product-title}.

[WARNING]
====
System containers are currently OS-specific because they require specific
versions of `atomic` and systemd. For example, different system containers are
created for RHEL, Fedora, or CentOS. Ensure that the system containers you are
using match the OS of the host they will run on.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
{product-title} only supports RHEL and RHEL Atomic as the host OS, so by default
system containers built for RHEL are used.
endif::[]
====

[[advanced-install-etcd-system-container]]
=== Running etcd as a System Container

When using the RPM-based installation method for {product-title}, etcd is
installed using RPM packages on any RHEL systems. When using the containerized
installation method, the `rhel7/etcd` image is used instead for RHEL or RHEL
Atomic Hosts.

However, you can configure your {product-title} installation to alternatively
run etcd as a system container. Whereas the standard containerized method uses
a systemd service named `etcd_container`, the system container method uses the
service name etcd, same as the RPM-based method. The data directory for etcd
using this method is *_/var/lib/etcd_*.

To run etcd as a system container, set the following cluster variable in your
inventory file in the `[OSEv3:vars]` section:

----
openshift_use_etcd_system_container=True
----

[[advanced-install-configuring-registry-location]]
== Configuring a Registry Location

If you are using an image registry other than the default at
`registry.access.redhat.com`, specify the desired registry within the
*_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file.

----
oreg_url={registry}/openshift3/ose-${component}:${version}
openshift_examples_modify_imagestreams=true
----

.Registry Variables
[options="header"]
|===

|Variable |Purpose
|`*oreg_url*`
|Set to the alternate image location. Necessary if you are not using the default registry at `registry.access.redhat.com`.

|`*openshift_examples_modify_imagestreams*`
|Set to `true` if pointing to a registry other than the default. Modifies the image stream location to the value of `*oreg_url*`.
|===

For example:
----
oreg_url=example.com/openshift3/ose-${component}:${version}
openshift_examples_modify_imagestreams=true
----

[[advanced-install-configuring-docker-route]]
== Configuring a Registry Route

To allow users to push and pull images to the internal Docker registry from
outside of the {product-title} cluster, configure the registry route in the
*_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file. By default, the registry route is
*_docker-registry-default.router.default.svc.cluster.local_*.


.Registry Route Variables
[options="header"]
|===

|Variable |Purpose
|`*openshift_hosted_registry_routehost*`
|Set to the value of the desired registry route. The route contains either
a name that resolves to an infrastructure node where a router manages
communication or the subdomain that you set as the default application subdomain
wildcard value. For example, if you set the `openshift_master_default_subdomain`
parameter to `apps.example.com` and `*.apps.example.com` resolves to
infrastructure nodes or a load balancer, you might use
`registry.apps.example.com` as the registry route.

|`*openshift_hosted_registry_routecertificates*`
a|Set the paths to the registry certificates. If you do not provide values for
the certificate locations, certificates are generated. You can define locations
for the following certificates:

* `*certfile*`
* `*keyfile*`
* `*cafile*`

|`*openshift_hosted_registry_routetermination*`
a| Set to one of the following values:

* Set to `reencrypt` to terminate encryption at the edge
router and re-encrypt it with a new certificate supplied by the destination.
* Set to `passthrough` to terminate encryption at
the destination. The destination is responsible for decrypting traffic.
|===

For example:
----
openshift_hosted_registry_routehost=<path>
openshift_hosted_registry_routetermination=reencrypt
openshift_hosted_registry_routecertificates= "{'certfile': '<path>/org-cert.pem', 'keyfile': '<path>/org-privkey.pem', 'cafile': '<path>/org-chain.pem'}"

[[advanced-install-registry-storage]]
=== Configuring Registry Storage

If no registry storage options are used, the default OpenShift Container
Registry is ephemeral and all data will be lost when the pod no longer exists.
There are several options for enabling registry storage when using the advanced
installer:

[discrete]
[[advanced-install-registry-storage-nfs-host-group]]
==== Option A: NFS Host Group

[NOTE]
====
The use of NFS for registry storage is not recommended in {product-title}.
====

When the following variables are set, an NFS volume is created during cluster
installation with the path *_<nfs_directory>/<volume_name>_* on the host within
the `[nfs]` host group. For example, the volume path using these options would
be *_/exports/registry_*:

[[advanced-install-registry-storage-external-nfs]]
==== Option B: External NFS Host

[NOTE]
====
The use of NFS for registry storage is not recommended in {product-title}.
====

To use an external NFS volume, one must already exist with a path of
*_<nfs_directory>/<volume_name>_* on the storage host. The remote volume path
using the following options would be *_nfs.example.com:/exports/registry_*.

[[advanced-install-cluster-registry-storage-upgrade-nfs]]
==== Upgrading or Installing {product-title} with NFS

The use of NFS for the core {product-title} components is not recommended, as NFS
(and the NFS Protocol) does not provide the proper consistency needed for the
applications that make up the {product-title} infrastructure.

As a result, the installer and update playbooks require an option to enable the use
of NFS with core infrastructure components.

[[advanced-install-registry-storage-glusterfs]]
==== Option E: {gluster-native}

Similar to
xref:advanced-install-containerized-glusterfs-persistent-storage[configuring {gluster-native}],

[[advanced-install-configuring-global-proxy]]
== Configuring Global Proxy Options

If your hosts require use of a HTTP or HTTPS proxy in order to connect to
external hosts, there are many components that must be configured to use the
proxy, including masters, Docker, and builds. Node services only connect to the
master API requiring no external access and therefore do not need to be
configured to use a proxy.

In order to simplify this configuration, the following Ansible variables can be
specified at a cluster or host level to apply these settings uniformly across
your environment.

[NOTE]
====
See install_config/build_defaults_overrides.adoc#install-config-build-defaults-overrides[Configuring
Global Build Defaults and Overrides] for more information on how the proxy
environment is defined for builds.
====

.Cluster Proxy Variables
[options="header"]
|===

|Variable |Purpose

|`openshift_http_proxy`
|This variable specifies the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable for masters and
the Docker daemon.

|`openshift_https_proxy`
|This variable specifices the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable for masters
and the Docker daemon.

|`openshift_no_proxy`
|This variable is used to set the `NO_PROXY` environment variable for masters
and the Docker daemon. Provide a comma-separated list of host names, domain
names, or wildcard host names that do not use the defined proxy. By default,
this list is augmented with the list of all defined {product-title} host names.

|`openshift_generate_no_proxy_hosts`
|This boolean variable specifies whether or not the names of all defined
OpenShift hosts and `pass:[*.cluster.local]` should be automatically appended to
the `NO_PROXY` list. Defaults to `true`; set it to `false` to override this
option.

|`openshift_builddefaults_http_proxy`
|This variable defines the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable inserted into
builds using the `BuildDefaults` admission controller. If
`openshift_http_proxy` is set, this variable will inherit that value; you only
need to set this if you want your builds to use a different value.

|`openshift_builddefaults_https_proxy`
|This variable defines the `*HTTPS_PROXY*` environment variable inserted into
builds using the `*BuildDefaults*` admission controller. If
`*openshift_https_proxy*` is set, this variable will inherit that value; you
only need to set this if you want your builds to use a different value.

|`openshift_builddefaults_no_proxy`
|This variable defines the `NO_PROXY` environment variable inserted into
builds using the `BuildDefaults` admission controller. If
`openshift_no_proxy` is set, this variable will inherit that value; you only
need to set this if you want your builds to use a different value.

|`openshift_builddefaults_git_http_proxy`
|This variable defines the HTTP proxy used by `git clone` operations during a
build, defined using the `BuildDefaults` admission controller. If
`openshift_builddefaults_http_proxy` is set, this variable will inherit that
value; you only need to set this if you want your `git clone` operations to use
a different value.

|`openshift_builddefaults_git_https_proxy`
|This variable defines the HTTPS proxy used by `git clone` operations during a
build, defined using the `BuildDefaults` admission controller. If
`openshift_builddefaults_https_proxy` is set, this variable will inherit that
value; you only need to set this if you want your `git clone` operations to use
a different value.
|===

[[advanced-install-no-proxy-list]]
If any of:

- `openshift_no_proxy`
- `openshift_https_proxy`
- `openshift_http_proxy`

are set, then all cluster hosts will have an automatically generated `NO_PROXY`
environment variable injected into several service configuration scripts. The
default `.svc` domain and your cluster's `dns_domain` (typically
`.cluster.local`) will also be added.

[NOTE]
====
Setting `openshift_generate_no_proxy_hosts` to `false` in your inventory will
not disable the automatic addition of the `.svc` domain and the cluster domain.
These are required and added automatically if any of the above listed proxy
parameters are set.
====

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
[[advanced-install-configuring-firewalls]]
== Configuring the Firewall

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are changing the default firewall, ensure that each host in your cluster
is using the same firewall type to prevent inconsistencies.
====

[NOTE]
====
While iptables is the default firewall, firewalld is recommended for new
installations.
====

{product-title} uses iptables as the default firewall, but you can configure
your cluster to use firewalld during the install process.

Because iptables is the default firewall, {product-title} is designed to have it
configured automatically. However, iptables rules can break {product-title} if
not configured correctly. The advantages of firewalld include allowing multiple
objects to safely share the firewall rules.

To use firewalld as the firewall for an {product-title} installation, add the
`os_firewall_use_firewalld` variable to the list of configuration variables in
the Ansible host file at install:

----
[OSEv3:vars]
os_firewall_use_firewalld=True
----

Setting this variable to `true` opens the required ports and adds rules to the
default zone, ensuring that firewalld is configured correctly.

[NOTE]
====
Using the firewalld default configuration comes with limited configuration
options, and cannot be overridden. For example, while you can set up a storage
network with interfaces in multiple zones, the interface that nodes communicate
on must be in the default zone.
====

endif::[]

[[marking-masters-as-unschedulable-nodes]]
== Configuring Schedulability on Masters

Any hosts you designate as masters during the installation process should also
be configured as nodes so that the masters are configured as part of the
xref:../architecture/networking/network_plugins.adoc#openshift-sdn[OpenShift SDN]. You must do so by adding entries for these hosts to the `[nodes]` section:

----
[nodes]
master.example.com
----

In previous versions of {product-title}, master hosts were marked as
unschedulable nodes by default by the installer, meaning that new pods could not
be placed on the hosts. Starting with {product-title} 3.9, however, masters are
marked schedulable automatically during installation. This change is mainly so
that the web console, which used to run as part of the master itself, can
instead be run as a pod deployed to the master.

If you want to change the schedulability of a host post-installation, see
xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#marking-nodes-as-unschedulable-or-schedulable[Marking Nodes as Unschedulable or Schedulable].

[[configuring-node-host-labels]]
== Configuring Node Host Labels

You can assign
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[labels] to
node hosts during the Ansible install by configuring the *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*
file. Labels are useful for determining the placement of pods onto nodes using
the
xref:../admin_guide/scheduling/scheduler.adoc#configurable-predicates[scheduler].
Other than `region=infra` (referred to as _dedicated infrastructure nodes_ and
discussed further in xref:configuring-dedicated-infrastructure-nodes[Configuring
Dedicated Infrastructure Nodes]), the actual label names and values are
arbitrary and can be assigned however you see fit per your cluster's
requirements.

To assign labels to a node host during an Ansible install, use the
`openshift_node_labels` variable with the desired labels added to the desired
node host entry in the `[nodes]` section. In the following example, labels are
set for a region called `primary` and a zone called `east`:

----
[nodes]
node1.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'east'}"
----

Starting in {product-title} 3.9, masters are now marked as schedulable nodes by
default. As a result, the default node selector (defined in the master
configuration file's `projectConfig.defaultNodeSelector` field to determine
which node that projects will use by default when placing pods, and previously
left blank by default) is now set by default during cluster installations. It is
set to `node-role.kubernetes.io/compute=true` unless overridden using the
`osm_default_node_selector` Ansible variable.

In addition, whether `osm_default_node_selector` is set or not, the following
automatic labeling occurs for hosts defined in your inventory file during
installation:

- non-master, non-dedicated infrastructure nodes hosts (for example, the
`node1.example.com` host shown above) are labeled with
`node-role.kubernetes.io/compute=true`
- master nodes are labeled `node-role.kubernetes.io/master=true`

This ensures that the default node selector has available nodes to choose from
when determining pod placement.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you accept the default node selector of
`node-role.kubernetes.io/compute=true` during installation, ensure that you do
not only have dedicated infrastructure nodes as the non-master nodes defined in
your cluster. In that scenario, application pods would fail to deploy because no
nodes with the `node-role.kubernetes.io/compute=true` label would be available
to match the default node selector when scheduling pods for projects.
====

See
xref:../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#setting-the-cluster-wide-default-node-selector[Setting the Cluster-wide Default Node Selector] for steps on adjusting this setting
post-installation if needed.

[[configuring-dedicated-infrastructure-nodes]]
=== Configuring Dedicated Infrastructure Nodes

It is recommended for production environments that you maintain dedicated
infrastructure nodes where the registry and router pods can run separately from
pods used for user applications.

The `openshift_router_selector` and `openshift_registry_selector` Ansible
settings determine the label selectors used when placing registry and router
pods. They are set to `region=infra` by default:

----
# default selectors for router and registry services
# openshift_router_selector='region=infra'
# openshift_registry_selector='region=infra'
----

The registry and router are only able to run on node hosts with the
`region=infra` label, which are then considered dedicated infrastructure nodes.
Ensure that at least one node host in your {product-title} environment has the
`region=infra` label. For example:

----
[nodes]
infra-node1.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'infra','zone': 'default'}"
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
If there is not a node in the `[nodes]` section that matches the selector
settings, the default router and registry will be deployed as failed with
`Pending` status.
====

If you do not intend to use {product-title} to manage the registry and router,
configure the following Ansible settings:

----
openshift_hosted_manage_registry=false
openshift_hosted_manage_router=false
----

If you are using an image registry other than the default `registry.access.redhat.com`,
you need to xref:advanced-install-configuring-registry-location[specify the desired registry]
in the  *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file.

As described in xref:marking-masters-as-unschedulable-nodes[Configuring
Schedulability on Masters], master hosts are marked schedulable by default. If
you label a master host with `region=infra` and have no other dedicated
infrastructure nodes, the master hosts must also be marked as schedulable.
Otherwise, the registry and router pods cannot be placed anywhere:

----
[nodes]
master.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'infra','zone': 'default'}" openshift_schedulable=true
----

[[advanced-install-session-options]]
== Configuring Session Options

xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#session-options[Session
options] in the OAuth configuration are configurable in the inventory file. By
default, Ansible populates a `*sessionSecretsFile*` with generated
authentication and encryption secrets so that sessions generated by one master
can be decoded by the others. The default location is
*_/etc/origin/master/session-secrets.yaml_*, and this file will only be
re-created if deleted on all masters.

You can set the session name and maximum number of seconds with
`*openshift_master_session_name*` and `*openshift_master_session_max_seconds*`:

----
openshift_master_session_name=ssn
openshift_master_session_max_seconds=3600
----

If provided, `*openshift_master_session_auth_secrets*` and
`*openshift_master_encryption_secrets*` must be equal length.

For `*openshift_master_session_auth_secrets*`, used to authenticate sessions
using HMAC, it is recommended to use secrets with 32 or 64 bytes:

----
openshift_master_session_auth_secrets=['DONT+USE+THIS+SECRET+b4NV+pmZNSO']
----

For `*openshift_master_encryption_secrets*`, used to encrypt sessions, secrets
must be 16, 24, or 32 characters long, to select AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256:

----
openshift_master_session_encryption_secrets=['DONT+USE+THIS+SECRET+b4NV+pmZNSO']
----

[[advanced-install-custom-certificates]]
== Configuring Custom Certificates

xref:../install_config/certificate_customization.adoc#install-config-certificate-customization[Custom serving
certificates] for the public host names of the {product-title} API and
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-web-console[web console]
can be deployed during cluster installation and are configurable in the
inventory file.

[NOTE]
====
Custom certificates should only be configured for the host name associated with
the `*publicMasterURL*` which can be set using
`*openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname*`. Using a custom serving certificate
for the host name associated with the `*masterURL*`
(*`openshift_master_cluster_hostname`*) will result in TLS errors as
infrastructure components will attempt to contact the master API using the
internal `*masterURL*` host.
====

Certificate and key file paths can be configured using the
`*openshift_master_named_certificates*` cluster variable:

----
openshift_master_named_certificates=[{"certfile": "/path/to/custom1.crt", "keyfile": "/path/to/custom1.key", "cafile": "/path/to/custom-ca1.crt"}]
----

File paths must be local to the system where Ansible will be run. Certificates
are copied to master hosts and are deployed within the
*_/etc/origin/master/named_certificates/_* directory.

Ansible detects a certificate's `Common Name` and `Subject Alternative Names`.
Detected names can be overridden by providing the `*"names"*` key when setting
`*openshift_master_named_certificates*`:

----
openshift_master_named_certificates=[{"certfile": "/path/to/custom1.crt", "keyfile": "/path/to/custom1.key", "names": ["public-master-host.com"], "cafile": "/path/to/custom-ca1.crt"}]
----

Certificates configured using `*openshift_master_named_certificates*` are cached
on masters, meaning that each additional Ansible run with a different set of
certificates results in all previously deployed certificates remaining in place
on master hosts and within the master configuration file.

If you would like `*openshift_master_named_certificates*` to be overwritten with
the provided value (or no value), specify the
`*openshift_master_overwrite_named_certificates*` cluster variable:

----
openshift_master_overwrite_named_certificates=true
----

For a more complete example, consider the following cluster variables in an
inventory file:

----
openshift_master_cluster_method=native
openshift_master_cluster_hostname=lb-internal.openshift.com
openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname=custom.openshift.com
----

To overwrite the certificates on a subsequent Ansible run, you could set the
following:

----
openshift_master_named_certificates=[{"certfile": "/root/STAR.openshift.com.crt", "keyfile": "/root/STAR.openshift.com.key", "names": ["custom.openshift.com"]}]
openshift_master_overwrite_named_certificates=true
----

[[advanced-install-config-certificate-validity]]
== Configuring Certificate Validity

By default, the certificates used to govern the etcd, master, and kubelet expire
after two to five years. The validity (length in days until they expire) for the
auto-generated registry, CA, node, and master certificates can be configured
during installation using the following variables (default values shown):

----
[OSEv3:vars]

openshift_hosted_registry_cert_expire_days=730
openshift_ca_cert_expire_days=1825
openshift_node_cert_expire_days=730
openshift_master_cert_expire_days=730
etcd_ca_default_days=1825
----

These values are also used when
xref:../install_config/redeploying_certificates.adoc#install-config-redeploying-certificates[redeploying certificates] via Ansible post-installation.

[[advanced-install-cluster-metrics]]
== Configuring Cluster Metrics

Cluster metrics are not set to automatically deploy. Set the following to enable
cluster metrics during cluster installation:

----
[OSEv3:vars]

openshift_metrics_install_metrics=true
----

The metrics public URL can be set during cluster
installation using the `openshift_metrics_hawkular_hostname` Ansible variable,
which defaults to:

`\https://hawkular-metrics.{{openshift_master_default_subdomain}}/hawkular/metrics`

If you alter this variable, ensure the host name is accessible via your router.

`openshift_metrics_hawkular_hostname=hawkular-metrics.{{openshift_master_default_subdomain}}`

[IMPORTANT]
====
In accordance with upstream Kubernetes rules, metrics can be collected only on the default interface of `eth0`.
====

[NOTE]
====
You must set an `openshift_master_default_subdomain` value to deploy metrics.
====

[[advanced-install-cluster-metrics-storage]]
=== Configuring Metrics Storage

The `openshift_metrics_cassandra_storage_type` variable must be set in order to
use persistent storage for metrics. If
`openshift_metrics_cassandra_storage_type` is not set, then cluster metrics data
is stored in an `emptyDir` volume, which will be deleted when the Cassandra pod
terminates.

There are three options for enabling cluster metrics storage during cluster
installation:

[discrete]
[[advanced-install-cluster-metrics-storage-dynamic]]
==== Option A: Dynamic

If your {product-title} environment supports
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-dynamically-provisioning-pvs[dynamic volume provisioning]
for your cloud provider, use the following variable:

----
[OSEv3:vars]

openshift_metrics_cassandra_storage_type=dynamic
----

If there are multiple default dynamically provisioned volume types, such as
gluster-storage and glusterfs-storage-block, you can specify the
provisioned volume type by variable. For example, `openshift_logging_es_pvc_storage_class_name=glusterfs-storage-block
openshift_metrics_cassandra_pvc_storage_class_name=glusterfs-storage-block`.

Check
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-node-config-volume-config[Volume
Configuration] for more information on using `DynamicProvisioningEnabled` to
enable or disable dynamic provisioning.

[discrete]
[[advanced-install-cluster-metrics-storage-nfs-host-group]]
==== Option B: NFS Host Group

[IMPORTANT]
====
The use of NFS for metrics storage is not recommended in
{product-title}.
====

When the following variables are set, an NFS volume is created during cluster
installation with path *_<nfs_directory>/<volume_name>_* on the host within the
`[nfs]` host group. For example, the volume path using these options would be
*_/exports/metrics_*:

----
[OSEv3:vars]

[[advanced-installation-logging-storage]]
=== Configuring Logging Storage

The `openshift_logging_es_pvc_dynamic` variable must be set in order to use
persistent storage for logging. If `openshift_logging_es_pvc_dynamic` is
not set, then cluster logging data is stored in an `emptyDir` volume, which will
be deleted when the Elasticsearch pod terminates.

There are three options for enabling cluster logging storage during cluster
installation:

[discrete]
[[advanced-installation-logging-storage-dynamic]]
==== Option A: Dynamic

If your {product-title} environment supports
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-dynamically-provisioning-pvs[dynamic volume provisioning]
for your cloud provider, use the following variable:

----
[OSEv3:vars]

openshift_logging_es_pvc_dynamic=true
----

If there are multiple default dynamically provisioned volume types, such as
gluster-storage and glusterfs-storage-block, you can specify the
provisioned volume type by variable. For example, `openshift_logging_es_pvc_storage_class_name=glusterfs-storage-block
openshift_metrics_cassandra_pvc_storage_class_name=glusterfs-storage-block`.

Check
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-node-config-volume-config[Volume
Configuration] for more information on using `DynamicProvisioningEnabled` to
enable or disable dynamic provisioning.

[[enabling-service-catalog]]
== Configuring the Service Catalog

The
xref:../architecture/service_catalog/index.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-service-catalog[service catalog] is enabled by default during installation. Enabling the service broker
allows service brokers to be registered with the catalog.

[NOTE]
====
To disable automatic deployment, set the following cluster variables in your
inventory file:

----
openshift_enable_service_catalog=false
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
openshift_service_catalog_image_prefix=openshift/origin-
openshift_service_catalog_image_version=latest
endif::[]
----

When the service catalog is enabled, the OpenShift Ansible broker and template service broker are both enabled
as well; see xref:configuring-openshift-ansible-broker[Configuring the OpenShift Ansible Broker] and xref:configuring-template-service-broker[Configuring the Template Service Broker] for more information.

[[configuring-openshift-ansible-broker]]
== Configuring the OpenShift Ansible Broker

The
xref:../architecture/service_catalog/ansible_service_broker.adoc#arch-ansible-service-broker[OpenShift Ansible broker] (OAB) is enabled by default during installation. However,
further configuration may be required for use.

[[configuring-oab-storage]]
=== Configuring Persistent Storage for the OpenShift Ansible Broker

The OAB deploys its own etcd instance separate from the etcd used by the rest of
the {product-title} cluster. The OAB's etcd instance requires separate storage
using persistent volumes (PVs) to function. If no PV is available, etcd will
wait until the PV can be satisfied. The OAB application will enter a `CrashLoop`
state until its etcd instance is available.

Some Ansible playbook bundles (APBs) also require a PV for their own usage in
order to deploy. For example, each of the database APBs have two plans: the
Development plan uses ephermal storage and does not require a PV, while the
Production plan is persisted and does require a PV.

[options="header"]
|===
|APB |PV Required?

|*postgresql-apb*
|Yes, but only for the Production plan

|*mysql-apb*
|Yes, but only for the Production plan

|*mariadb-apb*
|Yes, but only for the Production plan

|*mediawiki-apb*
|Yes

|===

To configure persistent storage for the OAB:

[NOTE]
====
The following example shows usage of an NFS host to provide the required PVs,
but
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/index.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-index[other persistent storage providers] can be used instead.
====

. In your inventory file, add `nfs` to the `[OSEv3:children]` section to enable
the `[nfs]` group:
+
----
[OSEv3:children]
masters

nfs
----

. Add a `[nfs]` group section and add the host name for the system that will
be the NFS host:

----
<1> An NFS volume will be created with path `<nfs_directory>/<volume_name>` on the
host within the `[nfs]` group. For example, the volume path using these options
would be *_/opt/osev3-etcd/etcd-vol2_*.

These settings create a persistent volume that is attached to the OAB's etcd
instance during cluster installation.

[[configuring-oab-local-apb-devel]]
=== Configuring the OpenShift Ansible Broker for Local APB Development

In order to do xref:../apb_devel/index.adoc#apb-devel-intro[APB development]
with the OpenShift Container Registry in conjunction with the OAB, a whitelist
of images the OAB can access must be defined. If a whitelist is not defined, the
broker will ignore APBs and users will not see any APBs available.

By default, the whitelist is empty so that a user cannot add APB images to the
broker without a cluster administrator configuring the broker. To whitelist all
images that end in `-apb`:

. In your inventory file, add the following to the `[OSEv3:vars]` section:
+
----
ansible_service_broker_local_registry_whitelist=['.*-apb$']

[[configuring-template-service-broker]]
== Configuring the Template Service Broker

The
xref:../architecture/service_catalog/template_service_broker.adoc#arch-template-service-broke[template service broker] (TSB) is enabled by default during installation.

To configure the TSB, one or more projects must be defined as the broker's
source namespace(s) for loading templates and image streams into the service
catalog. Set the desired projects by modifying the following in your inventory
file's `[OSEv3:vars]` section:

----
openshift_template_service_broker_namespaces=['openshift','myproject']
