== Overview
Over time, link:../architecture/core_concepts/index.html[API objects] created
in OpenShift can accumulate in the
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#master[etcd
data store] through normal user operations, such as when building and deploying
applications.

As an administrator, you can periodically prune older versions of objects from
your OpenShift instance that are no longer needed. For example, by pruning
images you can delete older images and layers that are no longer in use, but are
still taking up disk space. 

[[prune-operations]]

== Basic Prune Operations
The CLI groups prune operations under a common parent command.

----
$ oadm prune <object_type> <options>
----

This specifies:

- The `<object_type>` to perform the action on, such as `builds`,
`deployments`, or `images`.
- The `<options>` supported to prune that object type.

[[pruning-deployments]]

== Pruning Deployments

In order to prune deployments that are no longer required by the system due to
age and status, administrators may run the following command:

----
$ oadm prune deployments [<options>]
----

.Prune Deployments CLI Configuration Options
[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===

|Option |Description

.^|`--confirm`
|Indicate that pruning should occur, instead of performing a dry-run.

.^|`--orphans`
|Prune all deployments whose deployment config no longer exists, status is
complete or failed, and replica count is zero.

.^|`--keep-complete=<N>`
|Per deployment config, keep the last N deployments whose status is complete and
replica count is zero. (default `5`)

.^|`--keep-failed=<N>`
|Per deployment config, keep the last N deployments whose status is failed and
replica count is zero. (default `1`)

.^|`--keep-younger-than=<duration>`
|Do not prune any object that is younger than `<duration>` relative to the
current time. (default `60m`)
|===

To see what a pruning operation would delete:

----
$ oadm prune deployments --orphans --keep-complete=5 --keep-failed=1 \
    --keep-younger-than=60m
----

To actually perform the prune operation:

----
$ oadm prune deployments --orphans --keep-complete=5 --keep-failed=1 \
    --keep-younger-than=60m --confirm
----

[[pruning-builds]]

== Pruning Builds

In order to prune builds that are no longer required by the system due to age
and status, administrators may run the following command:

----
$ oadm prune builds [<options>]
----

.Prune Builds CLI Configuration Options
[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===

|Option |Description

.^|`--confirm`
|Indicate that pruning should occur, instead of performing a dry-run.

.^|`--orphans`
|Prune all builds whose build config no longer exists, status is complete,
failed, error, or canceled.

.^|`--keep-complete=<N>`
|Per build config, keep the last N builds whose status is complete. (default
`5`)

.^|`--keep-failed=<N>`
|Per build config, keep the last N builds whose status is failed, error, or
canceled (default `1`)

.^|`--keep-younger-than=<duration>`
|Do not prune any object that is younger than `<duration>` relative to the
current time. (default `60m`)
|===

To see what a pruning operation would delete:

----
$ oadm prune builds --orphans --keep-complete=5 --keep-failed=1 \
    --keep-younger-than=60m
----

To actually perform the prune operation:

----
$ oadm prune builds --orphans --keep-complete=5 --keep-failed=1 \
    --keep-younger-than=60m --confirm
----

[[pruning-images]]

== Pruning Images

In order to prune images that are no longer required by the system due to age
and status, administrators may run the following command:

----
$ oadm prune images [<options>]
----

[NOTE]
====
Currently, to prune images you must first
link:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#basic-setup-and-login[log in to the
CLI] as a user with an
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.html#oauth[access
token]. The user must also have the
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[cluster role]
*system:image-pruner* or greater (for example, *cluster-admin*).

.Prune Images CLI Configuration Options
[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===

|Option |Description

.^|`--certificate-authority`
|The path to a certificate authority file to use when communicating with the
OpenShift-managed registries. Defaults to the certificate authority data from
the current user's config file.

.^|`--confirm`
|Indicate that pruning should occur, instead of performing a dry-run.

.^|`--keep-tag-revisions=<N>`
|For each image stream, keep up to at most N image revisions per tag. (default
`3`)

.^|`--keep-younger-than=<duration>`
|Do not prune any image that is younger than `<duration>` relative to the
current time. Do not prune any image that is referenced by any other object that
is younger than `<duration>` relative to the current time. (default `60m`)
|===

OpenShift uses the following logic to determine which images and layers to
prune:

* Remove any image "managed by OpenShift" (i.e., images with the annotation
`*openshift.io/image.managed*`) that was created at least
`--keep-younger-than` minutes ago and is not currently referenced by:
- any pod created less than `--keep-younger-than` minutes ago.
- any image stream created less than `--keep-younger-than` minutes ago.
- any running pods.
- any pending pods.
- any replication controllers.
- any deployment configurations.
- any build configurations.
- any builds.
- the `--keep-tag-revisions` most recent items in
 `*stream.status.tags[].items*`.

* There is no support for pruning from external registries.

* When an image is pruned, all references to the image are removed from all
image streams that have a reference to the image in `*status.tags*`.

* Image layers that are no longer referenced by any images are removed as well.

To see what a pruning operation would delete:

----
$ oadm prune images --keep-tag-revisions=3 --keep-younger-than=60m
----

To actually perform the prune operation:

----
$ oadm prune images --keep-tag-revisions=3 --keep-younger-than=60m --confirm
----
