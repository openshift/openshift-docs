== Overview

IPsec protects traffic in an {product-title} cluster by encrypting the
communication between all master and node hosts that communicate using the
Internet Protocol (IP).

This topic shows how to secure communication of an entire IP subnet from which
the {product-title} hosts receive their IP addresses, including all cluster
management and pod data traffic. 

[NOTE]
====
Because {product-title} management traffic uses HTTPS, enabling IPsec encrypts
management traffic a second time.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
This procedure should be repeated on each master host, then node host, in your
cluster. Hosts that does not have IPsec enabled will not be able to communicate
with a host that does.

== Encrypting Hosts

[[admin-guide-ipsec-prerequisites]]
=== Step 1: Prerequisites
Ensure that the *libreswan* package, version 3.19 or later, is installed
on cluster hosts. Only version 3.19 and later includes the necessary
opportunistic group functionality that allows hosts to be configured without
knowledge of every other host in the cluster.

[[admin-guide-ipsec-certificates]]
=== Step 2: Certificates
By default, {product-title} secures cluster management communication with
mutually authenticated HTTPS communication. This means that both the client (for
example, an {product-title} node) and the server (for example, an
{product-title} api-server) send each other their certificates, which are
checked against a known certificate authority (CA). These certificates are
generated at cluster set up time, and typically live on each host.

These certificates can also be used to secure pod communications with IPsec. You
need three files on each host:

* Cluster CA file
* Host client certificate file
* Host private key file

. Determine what the certificate's nickname will be after it has been
imported into the *libreswan* certificate database. The nickname is taken
directly from the certificate's subject's Common Name (CN):
+
----
# openssl x509 \
  -in /path/to/client-certificate -subject -noout | \
  sed -n 's/.*CN=\(.*\)/\1/p'
----

. Use *openssl* to combine the client certificate, CA certificate, and private
key files into a *_PKCS#12_* file, which is a common file format for multiple
certificates and keys:
+
----
openssl pkcs12 -export \
  -in /path/to/client-certificate \
  -inkey /path/to/private-key \
  -certfile /path/to/certificate-authority \
  -passout pass: \
  -out certs.p12
----

. Import the *_PKCS#12_* file into the *libreswan* certificate database. The
`-W` option is left empty, because no password is assigned to the *_PKCS#12_*
file, as it is only temporary.
+
----
# ipsec initnss
# pk12util -i certs.p12 -d sql:/etc/ipsec.d -W ""
# rm certs.p12
----

[[admin-guide-ipsec-ipsec-policy]]
=== Step 3: libreswan IPsec Policy
Now that the necessary certificates are imported into the *libreswan*
certificate database, create a policy that uses them to secure communication
between hosts in your cluster.

The following configuration creates two *libreswan* connections. The first
encrypts traffic using the {product-title} certificates, while the second
creates exceptions to the encryption for cluster-external traffic.

. Place the following into the *_/etc/ipsec.d/openshift-cluster.conf_* file:
+
----
conn private
	left=%defaultroute
	leftid=%fromcert
	# our certificate
	leftcert="NSS Certificate DB:<cert_nickname>" <1>
	right=%opportunisticgroup
	rightid=%fromcert
	# their certificate transmitted via IKE
	rightca=%same
	ikev2=insist
	authby=rsasig
	failureshunt=drop
	negotiationshunt=hold
	auto=ondemand

conn clear
	left=%defaultroute
	right=%group
	authby=never
	type=passthrough
	auto=route
	priority=100
----
<1> Replace <cert_nickname> with the certificate nickname from step one.

. Tell *libreswan*
which IP subnets and hosts to apply each policy using policy
files in *_/etc/ipsec.d/policies/_*, where each configured connection has a
corresponding policy file. So, in the example above, the two connections,
`private` and `clear`, each have a file in *_/etc/ipsec.d/policies/_*.
+
*_/etc/ipsec.d/policies/private_* should contain the IP subnet of your cluster,
which your hosts receive IP addresses from. By default, this causes all
communication between hosts in the cluster subnet to be encrypted if the remote
host's client certificate authenticates against the local host's Certificate
Authority certificate. If the remote host's certificate does not authenticate,
all traffic between the two hosts will be blocked.
+
For example, if all hosts are configured to use addresses in the `172.16.0.0/16`
address space, your `private` policy file would contain `172.16.0.0/16`. Any
number of additional subnets to encrypt may be added to this file, which results
in all traffic to those subnets using IPsec as well.

. Unencrypt the encryption between all hosts and the subnet gateway to ensure
that traffic can enter and exit the cluster. Add the gateway to the
*_/etc/ipsec.d/policies/clear_* file:
+
----
172.16.0.1/32
----
+
Additional hosts and subnets may be added to this file, which will result in
all traffic to these hosts and subnets being unencrypted.

. Restart the *libreswan* service to load the new configuration and policies,
and begin encrypting:
+
----
systemctl restart ipsec
----

[[admin-guide-ipsec-troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting
When authentication cannot be completed between two hosts, you will not be able
to ping between them, because all IP traffic will be rejected. If the `clear`
policy is not configured correctly, you will also not be able to SSH to the host
from another host in the cluster. 

You can use the `ipsec status` command to check that the `clear` and `private`
policies have been loaded.
