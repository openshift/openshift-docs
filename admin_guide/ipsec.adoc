== Overview

IPsec protects traffic in an {product-title} cluster by encrypting the
communication between all master and node hosts that communicate using the
Internet Protocol (IP).

This topic shows how to secure communication of an entire IP subnet from which
the {product-title} hosts receive their IP addresses, including all cluster
management and pod data traffic.

[NOTE]
====
Because {product-title} management traffic uses HTTPS, enabling IPsec encrypts
management traffic a second time.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
This procedure must be repeated on each master host, then node host, in your
cluster. Hosts that do not have IPsec enabled will not be able to communicate
with a host that does.

[[admin-guide-ipsec-encrypting-hosts]]
== Encrypting hosts

[discrete]
=== Prerequisites

* Ensure that *libreswan* 3.15 or later is installed on cluster hosts.
If opportunistic group functionality is required, then *libreswan* version 3.19 or later is required.

* This topic describes an IPsec configuration that requires `62` bytes.
If the cluster is operating on an Ethernet network with a maximum transmission unit (MTU) value of `1500` bytes then the SDN MTU value must be changed to `1388` bytes to allow for the overhead of IPsec and the SDN encapsulation.
Complete the following procedure to change the MTU for the nodes in your cluster:
+
.. Edit each of the following ConfigMaps: `node-config-master`, `node-config-infra`, `node-config-compute`.

... Run the following command to edit the ConfigMap. Replace `<config_map>` with the name of the ConfigMap to edit.
+
----
# oc edit cm <config_map> -n openshift-node
----

... Update the `mtu` parameter to an MTU size sufficient for the IPsec overhead, such as `1388` bytes:
+
[source,yaml]
----
networkConfig:
  mtu: 1388
----

.. Remove the SDN interface by running the following command. Replace `<ovs_pod_name>` with the name of the OVS pod.
+
----
# oc exec <ovs_pod_name> -- ovs-vsctl del-br br0
----

.. For each node in your cluster, complete the following actions:

... Confirm that the updated MTU value is saved to the `/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml` file.

... Restart the SDN and OVS pods by running the following commands:
+
----
# oc delete pod -n openshift-sdn -l=app=ovs
# oc delete pod -n openshift-sdn -l=app=sdn
----

[[admin-guide-ipsec-certificates]]
=== Configuring certificates for IPsec

You can generate RSA keys suitable for IPsec by using the {product-title} internal certificate authority (CA). The internal CA has the common name (CN) value set to `openshift-signer`.

. Run the following commands to generate the RSA certificates on the master node:
+
----
# export CA=/etc/origin/master

# oc adm ca create-server-cert \
  --signer-cert=$CA/ca.crt --signer-key=$CA/ca.key \
  --signer-serial=$CA/ca.serial.txt \
  --hostnames='<hostname>' \ <1>
  --cert=<hostname>.crt \ <1>
  --key=<hostname>.key <1>
----
<1> Replace `<hostname>` with the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the node.

. Use *openssl* to combine the client certificate, CA certificate, and private
key files into a *_PKCS#12_* file, which is a common file format for multiple
certificates and keys:
+
----
# openssl pkcs12 -export \
  -in <hostname>.crt \ <1>
  -inkey <hostname>.key \ <1>
  -certfile  /etc/origin/master/ca.crt \
  -passout pass: \
  -out <hostname>.p12 <1>
----
<1> Replace with the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the node.

. For each node in your cluster, securely transfer the file that you created for the host in the previous step, and then import the *_PKCS#12_* file into the *libreswan* certificate database.
+
The `-W` option is left empty because no password is assigned to the *_PKCS#12_*
file, as it is only temporary.
+
----
# ipsec initnss
# pk12util -i <hostname>.p12 -d sql:/etc/ipsec.d -W ""
# rm <hostname>.p12
----

[[admin-guide-ipsec-ipsec-policy]]
=== Creating the libreswan IPsec policy

After ensuring that the necessary certificates are imported into the *libreswan*
certificate database, create a policy that uses them to secure communication
between hosts in your cluster.

If you are using *libreswan* 3.19 or later, then opportunistic
group configuration is recommended. Otherwise, explicit connections are
required.

[[admin-guide-ipsec-opportunistic-group-configuration]]
==== Configuring the opportunistic group

The following configuration creates two *libreswan* connections. The first
encrypts traffic using the {product-title} certificates, while the second
creates exceptions to the encryption for cluster-external traffic.

. Place the following into the *_/etc/ipsec.d/openshift-cluster.conf_* file:
+
----
conn private
	left=%defaultroute
	leftid=%fromcert
	# our certificate
	leftcert="NSS Certificate DB:<cert_nickname>" <1>
	right=%opportunisticgroup
	rightid=%fromcert
	# their certificate transmitted via IKE
	rightca=%same
	ikev2=insist
	authby=rsasig
	failureshunt=drop
	negotiationshunt=hold
	auto=ondemand
	encapsulation=yes <2>

conn clear
	left=%defaultroute
	right=%group
	authby=never
	type=passthrough
	auto=route
	priority=100
----
<1> Replace <cert_nickname> with the certificate nickname from step one.
<2> If you do not use NAT, you must include `encapsulation=yes` in the configuration to force encapsulation. The **Amazon** and **Azure** internal cloud networks do not route IPsec `ESP` or `AH` packets. These packets must be encapsulated in `UDP`, and if it is configured, NAT detection configures the `ESP` in `UDP` encapsulation. If you use NAT or if you are not under the Network/Cloud-Provider limitations as described before, omit this parameter and value.

. Tell *libreswan*
which IP subnets and hosts to apply each policy using policy
files in *_/etc/ipsec.d/policies/_*, where each configured connection has a
corresponding policy file. So, in the example above, the two connections,
`private` and `clear`, each have a file in *_/etc/ipsec.d/policies/_*.
+
*_/etc/ipsec.d/policies/private_* must contain the IP subnet of your cluster,
which your hosts receive IP addresses from. By default, this causes all
communication between hosts in the cluster subnet to be encrypted if the remote
host's client certificate authenticates against the local host's Certificate
Authority certificate. If the remote host's certificate does not authenticate,
all traffic between the two hosts will be blocked.
+
For example, if all hosts are configured to use addresses in the `172.16.0.0/16`
address space, your `private` policy file would contain `172.16.0.0/16`. Any
number of additional subnets to encrypt may be added to this file, which results
in all traffic to those subnets using IPsec as well.

. Unencrypt the communication between all hosts and the subnet gateway to ensure
that traffic can enter and exit the cluster. Add the gateway to the
*_/etc/ipsec.d/policies/clear_* file:
+
----
172.16.0.1/32
----
+
Additional hosts and subnets may be added to this file, which will result in
all traffic to these hosts and subnets being unencrypted.

[[admin-guide-ipsec-explicit-connection-configuration]]
==== Configuring the explicit connection

In this configuration, each IPsec node configuration must explicitly list the
configuration of every other node in the cluster. Using a configuration
management tool such as Ansible to generate this file on each host is
recommended.

[NOTE]
====
Do not manually edit the `node-config.yaml` file.
To modify a node in your cluster, update the xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#modifying-nodes[node configuration maps] as needed.
====

This configuration also requires the full certificate subject of each node to
be placed into the configuration for every other node.

. Use *openssl* to read this subject from the node's certificate:
+
----
# openssl x509 \
  -in /path/to/client-certificate -text | \
  grep "Subject:" | \
  sed 's/[[:blank:]]*Subject: //'
----

. Place the following lines into the *_/etc/ipsec.d/openshift-cluster.conf_* file on each node for every other node in the cluster:
+
----
conn <other_node_hostname>
        left=<this_node_ip> <1>
        leftid="CN=<this_node_cert_nickname>" <2>
        leftrsasigkey=%cert
        leftcert=<this_node_cert_nickname> <2>
        right=<other_node_ip> <3>
        rightid="<other_node_cert_full_subject>" <4>
        rightrsasigkey=%cert
        auto=start
        keyingtries=%forever
	encapsulation=yes <5>	
----
<1> Replace <this_node_ip> with the cluster IP address of this node.
<2> Replace <this_node_cert_nickname> with the node certificate nickname from step one.
<3> Replace <other_node_ip> with the cluster IP address of the other node.
<4> Replace <other_node_cert_full_subject> with the other node's certificate subject from just above. For example: "O=system:nodes,CN=openshift-node-45.example.com".
<5> If you do not use NAT, you must include `encapsulation=yes` in the configuration to force encapsulation. The **Amazon** and **Azure** internal cloud networks do not route IPsec `ESP` or `AH` packets. These packets must be encapsulated in `UDP`, and if it is configured, NAT detection configures the `ESP` in `UDP` encapsulation. If you use NAT or if you are not under the Network/Cloud-Provider limitations as described before, omit this parameter and value.

. Place the following in the *_/etc/ipsec.d/openshift-cluster.secrets_* file on each node:
+
----
: RSA "<this_node_cert_nickname>" <1>
----
<1> Replace <this_node_cert_nickname> with the node certificate nickname from step one.

[[admin-guide-ipsec-firewall-configuration]]
== Configuring the IPsec firewall

All nodes within the cluster need to allow IPsec related network traffic. This
includes IP protocol numbers 50 and 51 as well as UDP port 500.

For example, if the cluster nodes communicate over interface `eth0`:

----
-A OS_FIREWALL_ALLOW -i eth0 -p 50 -j ACCEPT
-A OS_FIREWALL_ALLOW -i eth0 -p 51 -j ACCEPT
-A OS_FIREWALL_ALLOW -i eth0 -p udp --dport 500 -j ACCEPT
----

[NOTE]
====
IPsec also uses UDP port 4500 for NAT traversal, though this should not apply
to normal cluster deployments.
====

[[admin-guide-starting-enabling-ipsec]]
== Starting and enabling IPsec

. Start the *ipsec* service to load the new configuration and policies,
and begin encrypting:
+
----
# systemctl start ipsec
----

. Enable the *ipsec* service to start on boot:
+
----
# systemctl enable ipsec
----

[[admin-guide-ipsec-optimizing]]
== Optimizing IPsec

See the
xref:../scaling_performance/network_optimization.adoc#scaling-performance-optimizing-ipsec[Scaling
and Performance Guide] for performance suggestions when encrypting with IPsec.

[[admin-guide-ipsec-troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting
When authentication cannot be completed between two hosts, you will not be able
to ping between them, because all IP traffic will be rejected. If the `clear`
policy is not configured correctly, you will also not be able to SSH to the host
from another host in the cluster.

You can use the `ipsec status` command to check that the `clear` and `private`
policies have been loaded.
