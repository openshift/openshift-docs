== Overview

IPsec protects traffic in an {product-title} cluster by encrypting the
communication between all master and node hosts that communicate using the
Internet Protocol (IP).

This topic shows how to secure communication of an entire IP subnet from which
the {product-title} hosts receive their IP addresses, including all cluster
management and pod data traffic.

[NOTE]
====
Because {product-title} management traffic uses HTTPS, enabling IPsec encrypts
management traffic a second time.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
This procedure should be repeated on each master host, then node host, in your
cluster. Hosts that do not have IPsec enabled will not be able to communicate
with a host that does.

== Encrypting Hosts

[[admin-guide-ipsec-prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites

* Ensure that *libreswan* 3.15 or later is installed on
cluster hosts. If
xref:../admin_guide/ipsec.adoc#admin-guide-ipsec-opportunistic-group-configuration[opportunistic
group functionality] is required, then *libreswan* version 3.19 or later is
required.
* See the
 xref:../install_config/configuring_sdn.adoc#configuring-the-pod-network-on-nodes[Configure
 the pod network on nodes] section for information on how to configure the MTU
 to allow space for the IPSec header. This topic describes an IPSec
 configuration that requires 62 bytes. If the cluster is operating on an
 Ethernet network with an MTU of 1500 then the SDN MTU should be 1388, to allow
 for the overhead of IPSec and the SDN encapsulation.
+
After modifying the MTU in the {product-title} configuration, the SDN must be
made aware of the change by removing the SDN interface and restarting the
{product-title} node process.

[[admin-guide-ipsec-certificates]]
=== Configuring certificates for IPsec

By default, {product-title} secures cluster management communication with
mutually authenticated HTTPS communication. This means that both the client (for
example, an {product-title} node) and the server (for example, an
{product-title} api-server) send each other their certificates, which are
checked against a known certificate authority (CA). These certificates are
generated at cluster set up time and typically live on each host. These certificates can also be used to secure pod communications with IPsec. 

This procedure assumes you have the following on each host:

* Cluster CA file
* Host client certificate file
* Host private key file

. Determine what the certificate's nickname will be after it has been
imported into the *libreswan* certificate database. The nickname is taken
directly from the certificate's subject's Common Name (CN):
+
----
# openssl x509 \
  -in /path/to/client-certificate -subject -noout | \
  sed -n 's/.*CN=\(.*\)/\1/p'
----

. Use *openssl* to combine the client certificate, CA certificate, and private
key files into a *_PKCS#12_* file, which is a common file format for multiple
certificates and keys:
+
----
# openssl pkcs12 -export \
  -in /path/to/client-certificate \
  -inkey /path/to/private-key \
  -certfile /path/to/certificate-authority \
  -passout pass: \
  -out certs.p12
----

. Import the *_PKCS#12_* file into the *libreswan* certificate database. The
`-W` option is left empty because no password is assigned to the *_PKCS#12_*
file, as it is only temporary.
+
----
# ipsec initnss
# pk12util -i certs.p12 -d sql:/etc/ipsec.d -W ""
# rm certs.p12
----

[[admin-guide-ipsec-ipsec-policy]]
=== libreswan IPsec Policy

After ensuring that the necessary certificates are imported into the *libreswan*
certificate database, create a policy that uses them to secure communication
between hosts in your cluster.

If you are using *libreswan* 3.19 or later, then
xref:../admin_guide/ipsec.adoc#admin-guide-ipsec-opportunistic-group-configuration[opportunistic
group configuration] is recommended. Otherwise, explicit connections are
required.

[[admin-guide-ipsec-opportunistic-group-configuration]]
==== Opportunistic Group Configuration

The following configuration creates two *libreswan* connections. The first
encrypts traffic using the {product-title} certificates, while the second
creates exceptions to the encryption for cluster-external traffic.

. Place the following into the *_/etc/ipsec.d/openshift-cluster.conf_* file:
+
----
conn private
	left=%defaultroute
	leftid=%fromcert
	# our certificate
	leftcert="NSS Certificate DB:<cert_nickname>" <1>
	right=%opportunisticgroup
	rightid=%fromcert
	# their certificate transmitted via IKE
	rightca=%same
	ikev2=insist
	authby=rsasig
	failureshunt=drop
	negotiationshunt=hold
	auto=ondemand

conn clear
	left=%defaultroute
	right=%group
	authby=never
	type=passthrough
	auto=route
	priority=100
----
<1> Replace <cert_nickname> with the certificate nickname from step one.

. Tell *libreswan*
which IP subnets and hosts to apply each policy using policy
files in *_/etc/ipsec.d/policies/_*, where each configured connection has a
corresponding policy file. So, in the example above, the two connections,
`private` and `clear`, each have a file in *_/etc/ipsec.d/policies/_*.
+
*_/etc/ipsec.d/policies/private_* should contain the IP subnet of your cluster,
which your hosts receive IP addresses from. By default, this causes all
communication between hosts in the cluster subnet to be encrypted if the remote
host's client certificate authenticates against the local host's Certificate
Authority certificate. If the remote host's certificate does not authenticate,
all traffic between the two hosts will be blocked.
+
For example, if all hosts are configured to use addresses in the `172.16.0.0/16`
address space, your `private` policy file would contain `172.16.0.0/16`. Any
number of additional subnets to encrypt may be added to this file, which results
in all traffic to those subnets using IPsec as well.

. Unencrypt the communication between all hosts and the subnet gateway to ensure
that traffic can enter and exit the cluster. Add the gateway to the
*_/etc/ipsec.d/policies/clear_* file:
+
----
172.16.0.1/32
----
+
Additional hosts and subnets may be added to this file, which will result in
all traffic to these hosts and subnets being unencrypted.

[[admin-guide-ipsec-explicit-connection-configuration]]
==== Explicit Connection Configuration

In this configuration, each IPSec node configuration must explicitly list the
configuration of every other node in the cluster. Using a configuration
management tool such as Ansible to generate this file on each host is
recommended.

. This configuration also requires the full certificate subject of each node to
be placed into the configuration for every other node. To read this subject from
the node's certificate, use *openssl*:
+
----
# openssl x509 \
  -in /path/to/client-certificate -text | \
  grep "Subject:" | \
  sed 's/[[:blank:]]*Subject: //'
----

. Place the following lines into the *_/etc/ipsec.d/openshift-cluster.conf_* file on each node for every other node in the cluster:
+
----
conn <other_node_hostname>
        left=<this_node_ip> <1>
        leftid="CN=<this_node_cert_nickname>" <2>
        leftrsasigkey=%cert
        leftcert=<this_node_cert_nickname> <2>
        right=<other_node_ip> <3>
        rightid="<other_node_cert_full_subject>" <4>
        rightrsasigkey=%cert
        auto=start
        keyingtries=%forever
----
<1> Replace <this_node_ip> with the cluster IP address of this node.
<2> Replace <this_node_cert_nickname> with the node certificate nickname from step one.
<3> Replace <other_node_ip> with the cluster IP address of the other node.
<4> Replace <other_node_cert_full_subject> with the other node's certificate subject from just above. For example: "O=system:nodes,CN=openshift-node-45.example.com".

. Place the following in the *_/etc/ipsec.d/openshift-cluster.secrets_* file on each node:
+
----
: RSA "<this_node_cert_nickname>" <1>
----
<1> Replace <this_node_cert_nickname> with the node certificate nickname from step one.

[[admin-guide-ipsec-firewall-configuration]]
== IPSec Firewall Configuration

All nodes within the cluster need to allow IPSec related network traffic. This
includes IP protocol numbers 50 and 51 as well as UDP port 500.

For example, if the cluster nodes communicate over interface `eth0`:

----
-A OS_FIREWALL_ALLOW -i eth0 -p 50 -j ACCEPT
-A OS_FIREWALL_ALLOW -i eth0 -p 51 -j ACCEPT
-A OS_FIREWALL_ALLOW -i eth0 -p udp --dport 500 -j ACCEPT
----

[NOTE]
====
IPSec also uses UDP port 4500 for NAT traversal, though this should not apply
to normal cluster deployments.
====

[[admin-guide-starting-enabling-ipsec]]
== Starting and Enabling IPSec

. Start the *ipsec* service to load the new configuration and policies,
and begin encrypting:
+
----
# systemctl start ipsec
----

. Enable the *ipsec* service to start on boot:
+
----
# systemctl enable ipsec
----

[[admin-guide-ipsec-optimizing]]
== Optimizing IPSec

See the
xref:../scaling_performance/network_optimization.adoc#scaling-performance-optimizing-ipsec[Scaling
and Performance Guide] for performance suggestions when encrypting with IPSec.

[[admin-guide-ipsec-troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting
When authentication cannot be completed between two hosts, you will not be able
to ping between them, because all IP traffic will be rejected. If the `clear`
policy is not configured correctly, you will also not be able to SSH to the host
from another host in the cluster.

You can use the `ipsec status` command to check that the `clear` and `private`
policies have been loaded.
