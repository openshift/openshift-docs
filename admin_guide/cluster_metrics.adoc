== Overview

As an OpenShift administrator, you may want to view the metrics from all
containers and components in one user interface. The
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#kubelet[kubelet]
exposes metrics that can be collected and stored in various back ends by
link:https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/heapster[Heapster]. This guide uses 
link:https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-metrics[Hawkular Metrics] as a metrics engine which 
persists the data into a link:http://cassandra.apache.org/[Cassandra] database.

Once configured, CPU and memory-based metrics can be viewable from the OpenShift console.

For more information about the metrics integration, please refer to the
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin-metrics[origin metrics] github project.

== Using the `openshift-infra` Project

The metric components are required to be deployed to the `openshift-infra` project. This
is to allow the `horizontal pod autoscaler` to discover the heapster service and use it
to retrieve metrics to be used for autoscaling.
////
TODO: make a link to the HPA page once it exists.
//// 

All the following commands expect that they will be executed under the `openshift-infra` 
project. To switch to the `openshift-infra` project: 

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc project openshift-infra
----

== Service Accounts

=== Metrics Deployer Service Account

The metrics deployer requires a service account to be created for it. The service account can be created
using the following command:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc create -f - <<API
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: metrics-deployer
secrets:
- name: metrics-deployer
API
----

In order to deploy components within the _openshift-infra_ project, the metrics-deployer service account needs to be 
granted the `edit` permission for this project.

This can be accomplished by running the following command:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oadm policy add-role-to-user edit system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:metrics-deployer
----

=== Heapster Service Account

The heapster component requires accessing the kubernetes node to find all the available nodes as well 
as accessing the `/stats` endpoint on each of those nodes. This means that the heapster service account 
which requires having the `cluster-reader` permission.

The following command will give the heapster service account this required permission:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-reader system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:heapster
----

== Metric Data Storage

The metrics data can be stored to either 
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html[persistent storage] or to a
temporary link:../dev_guide/volumes.html[pod volume].

=== Persistent Storage

Running with persistent storage means that your metrics will be stored to a 
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html#persistent-volumes[persistent volume]
and be able to survive a pod being restarted or recreated. Running with persistent storage
is highly recommended if you require your metric data to be guarded from data loss.

In order to use persistent storage with the metric components, all that is required is that a
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html#persistent-volumes[persistent volume]
of sufficient size is available.

The creation of 
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html#persistent-volume-claims[persisten volume claims]
is handled by the metrics deployer.


=== Non-Persistent Storage

Running with non-persistent storage means that any stored metrics will be deleted with the pod. 
Metrics will still survive a container being restarted. It is 
much easier to run with non-persistent data, but with the tradeoff of potentially losing 
this metric data. Running with non-persistent data should only be done when data loss is acceptable.

In order to use non-persistent storage, you will need to set the 
`USE_PERSISTENT_STORAGE` template option to false for the deployer.


== Metrics Deployer

The `metrics deployer` is what is used to deploy and configure all the various metrics
components.

The `metrics deployer` can configured by passing in information from
link:../dev_guide/secrets.html[secrets] and by passing parameters to the deployer's 
link:../dev_guide/templates.html[template].

=== Metrics Deployer Secrets

By default the deployer will autogenerate self signed certificates to be used between the various
components. If you wish to provide your own certificates, it is possible to do so by passing these
values as link:../dev_guide/secrets.html[secrets] to the deployer.

[WARNING]
====
By default the Hawkular Metrics service uses self signed certificates which can cause problems
when the console accesses it in a browser. You may want to specify your own `hawkular-metrics.pem`
secret to use a certificate which will be trusted by the browser.
====

If you wish to provide your own certificate are configured to be trusted by your browser, you can do so by
pointing your secret to the certificate's pem and certificate authority certificate files:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc secrets new metrics-deployer hawkular-metrics.pem=/home/openshift/metrics/hm.pem \
                               hawkular-metrics-ca.cert=/home/openshift/metrics/hm-ca.cert
----

If you wish to use the default, autogenerated certificates you can do so by running the following
command:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc secrets new metrics-deployer nothing=/dev/null
----

For even more advanced configuration options, the following table contains all the various secrets which can be
used by the deployer:

[cols="2,4",options="header"]
|===

|Secret Name |Description

|hawkular-metrics.pem
|The pem file used for the Hawkular Metrics certificate. Autogenerated if not specified.

|hawkular-metrics-ca.cert
|The certificate for the CA used to sign the _hawkular-metrics.pem_. Ignored if _hawkular-metrics.pem_ is not specified.

|hawkular-cassandra.pem
|The pem file used for the Cassandra certificate. Autogenerated if not specified.

|hawkular-cassandra-ca.cert
|The certificate for the CA used to sign the _hawkular-cassandra.pem_. Ignored if _hawkular-cassandra.pem_ is not specified.

|heapster.cert
|The certificate used by Heapster. Autogenerated if not specified.

|heapster.key
|The key to be used with the heapster certificate. Ignored if _heapster.cert_ is not specified

|heapster_client_ca.cert
|The certificate authority certificate used to generate heapster.cert. Required if _heapster.cert_ is specified, otherwise its autogenerated

|heapster_allowed_users
|A file containing a comma separated list of CN to accept from certificates signed with the specified CA. By default set to no allowed users.

|===

== Creating the Deployer Template

The following is the template used to deploy the metrics components. You will need 
to save this to a file called *_metrics.yaml_*.

====
[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
----
apiVersion: "v1"

=== Deployer Template Parameters

Take note of the various template parameter options and their defaults listed in *_metrics.yaml_*.
If required you can override these values when creating the deployer.

Note that the only required parameter is `HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME`. You will be required to
specify this value when creating the deployer. This value is used to specify the hostname to be used
for the Hawkular Metrics link:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.html[route].

You will need to know this value when link:#accessing-metrics-in-the-console[configuring the console]
for metrics access.


== Deploying the Metric Components

Since deploying and configuring all the metric components is handled by the metrics deployer, its is fairly
simple to deploy everything in one step.

The following examples show how to deploy metrics with and without persistent storage using the default 
template parameters. If you wish, you can also specify any of the template parameters when calling these
commands.

=== Deploying with Persistent Storage

The following command will set the Hawkular Metrics route to use `hawkular-metrics.example.com` and will
be deployed using persistent storage.

In order for this command to work, you must have a persistent volume of sufficient size available to be used.

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc process -f metrics.yaml -v \
HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME=hawkular-metrics.example.com \
| oc create -f -
----

=== Deploying without Persistent Storage

The following command will set the Hawkular Metrics route to use `hawkular-metrics.example.com` and will
be deployed without persistent storage.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Since this is being deployed without persistent storage, metric data loss can occur.
====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc process -f metrics.yaml -v \
HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME=hawkular-metrics.example.com,USE_PERSISTENT_STORAGE=false \
| oc create -f -
----

== Configuring OpenShift

The console uses the data coming from the Hawkular Metrics service in order to display its graphs. The URL of where
the Hawkular Metrics service can be accessed needs to be configured via the `metricsPublicURL` option in the
link:master_node_configuration.html#master-configuration-files[master-config.yaml] file.

The URL corresponds to the route created with the `HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME` template parameter during the 
link:#deploying-the-metric-components[deployment] of the metrics components.

[NOTE]
====
This hostname needs to be resolveable from the browser accessing the console.
====

For instance, if your `HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME` corresponded to `hawkular-metrics.example.com`, then you would 
need to make the following change in the _master-config.yaml_ file:

====
[source,yaml,]
.master-config.yaml
----
  assetConfig:
    ...
    metricsPublicURL: "https://hawkular-metrics.example.com/hawkular/metrics"
----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The use of self signed certificates can be problematic. It is recommended to use certificates which are configured
to be acceptable by your browser. 

If you are using self signed certificates, remember that the Hawkular Metrics service is hosted under a different 
hostname and uses different certificates than the console. You may need to explicitly open a browser tab to the value 
specified in `metricsPublicURL` and accept that certificate.
====

Once you have updated and saved the _master-config.yaml_ file you will need to restart your OpenShift instance. 
Once your OpenShift server is running again, you should be able to see a _metrics_ tab under
the pod overview pages.
