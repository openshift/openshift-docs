[[managing-users-overview]]
== Overview

A user is an entity that interacts with the {product-title} API. These can be a
developer for developing applications or an administrator for managing the
cluster. Users can be assigned to groups, which set the permissions applied to
all the group's members. For example, you can give API access to a group, which
give all members of the group API access.

This topic describes the management of
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-projects-and-users[user]
accounts, including how new user accounts are created in {product-title} and how
they can be deleted.

[[managing-users-adding-a-user]]
== Creating a User

The process for creating a user depends on the configured
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#identity-providers_parameters[identity
provider].
endif::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
identity provider.
endif::openshift-dedicated[]
By default, {product-title} uses the `DenyAll` identity provider,
which denies access for all user names and passwords.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]

The following process creates a new user, then adds a role to the user:

. Create the user account depending on your identity provider. This can depend
on the `mappingmethod` used as part of the
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#identity-providers_parameters[identity
provider configuration].
. Give the new user the desired role:
+
----
# oc create clusterrolebinding <clusterrolebinding_name> \
  --clusterrole=<role> --user=<user>
----
+
Where the `--clusterrole` option is the desired cluster role. For example, to
give the new user `cluster-admin` privileges, which gives the user access to
everything within a cluster:
+
----
# oc create clusterrolebinding registry-controller \
  --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=admin
----
+
For an explanation and list of roles, see the
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[Cluster Roles
and Local Roles section of the Architecture Guide].

As a cluster administrator, you can also
xref:../admin_guide/manage_rbac.adoc#admin-guide-manage-rbac[manage the access
level of each user].

[NOTE]
====
Depending on the identity provider, and on the defined group structure, some
roles may be given to users automatically. See the
xref:../install_config/syncing_groups_with_ldap.adoc#install-config-syncing-groups-with-ldap[Synching
groups with LDAP section] for more information.

[[managing-users-viewing-user-and-identity-lists]]
== Viewing User and Identity Lists

{product-title} user configuration is stored in several locations within
{product-title}. Regardless of the identity provider, {product-title} internally
stores details like role-based access control (RBAC) information and group
membership. To completely remove user information, this data must be removed in
addition to the user account.

In {product-title}, two object types contain user data outside the
identification provider: `*user*` and `*identity*`.

To get the current list of users:

----
$ oc get user
NAME      UID                                    FULL NAME   IDENTITIES
demo     75e4b80c-dbf1-11e5-8dc6-0e81e52cc949               htpasswd_auth:demo
----

To get the current list of identities:

----
$ oc get identity
NAME                  IDP NAME        IDP USER NAME   USER NAME   USER UID
htpasswd_auth:demo    htpasswd_auth   demo            demo        75e4b80c-dbf1-11e5-8dc6-0e81e52cc949
----

Note the matching UID between the two object types. If you attempt to change the
authentication provider after starting to use {product-title}, the user names
that overlap will not work because of the entries in the identity list, which
will still point to the old authentication method.

[[admin-guide-managing-users-creating-groups]]
== Creating Groups

While a user is an entity making requests to {product-title}, users can be
organized into one or more groups made up from a set of users. Groups are useful
for managing many users at one time, such as for authorization policies, or to
grant permissions to multiple users at once.

If your organization is using LDAP, you can synchronize any LDAP records to
{product-title} so that you can configure groups on one place. This presumes
that information about your users is in an LDAP server.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
See the
xref:../install_config/syncing_groups_with_ldap.adoc#install-config-syncing-groups-with-ldap[Synching
groups with LDAP section] for more information.
endif::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]

If you are not using LDAP, you can use the following procedure to manually
create groups.

To create a new group:

----
# oc adm groups new <group_name> <user1> <user2>
----

For example, to create the `west` groups and in it place the `john` and `betty`
users:

----
# oc adm groups new west john betty
----

To verify that the group has been created, and list the users associated with
the group, run the following:

----
# oc get groups
NAME      USERS
west      john, betty
----

[[managing-users-managing-user-and-group-labels]]
== Managing User and Group Labels

To add a label to a user or group:

----
$ oc label user/<user_name> <label_name>=<label_value>
----

For example, if the user name is *theuser* and the label is *level=gold*:

----
$ oc label user/theuser level=gold
----

To remove the label:

----
$ oc label user/<user_name> <label_name>-
----

To show labels for a user or group:

----
$ oc describe user/<user_name>
----

[[managing-users-deleting-a-user]]
== Deleting a User

To delete a user:

. Delete the user record:
+
----
$ oc delete user demo
user "demo" deleted
----
+
. Delete the user identity.
+
The identity of the user is related to the identification provider you use. Get
the provider name from the user record in `oc get user`.
+
In this example, the identity provider name is *htpasswd_auth*. The command is:
+
----
# oc delete identity htpasswd_auth:demo
identity "htpasswd_auth:demo" deleted
----
+
If you skip this step, the user will not be able to log in again.

After you complete these steps, a new account will be created in {product-title}
when the user logs in again.

If your intention is to prevent the user from being able to log in again (for
example, if an employee has left the company and you want to permanently delete
the account), you can also remove the user from your authentication back end
(like *htpasswd*, *kerberos*, or others) for the configured identity
provider.

For example, if you are using *htpasswd*, delete the entry in the *_htpasswd_*
file that is configured for {product-title} with the user name and password.

For external identification management like Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol (LDAP) or Red Hat Identity Management (IdM), use the user management
tools to remove the user entry.
