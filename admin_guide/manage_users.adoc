== Adding Users

Once new users log in to OpenShift, an account is created for that user and the
cluster administrator can
link:../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.html[manage the access level of
each user].

== Deleting Users

=== Improper Deletion

OpenShift user configuration is stored in several locations within OpenShift.
Regardless of the identity provider, OpenShift internally stores details like
role-based access control (RBAC) information and group membership. To completely
remove user information, this data must be removed in addition to the user
account.

If an account is improperly deleted, the following type of error can be seen,
even though the identification provider already shows the user *myuser* as
existing:

====

This error is generated because OpenShift sees the user data in the internal
database that does not correspond to the external identity.

In OpenShift, two object types contain user data outside the identification
provider: type user and type identity.

Type user:

====
----
$ oc get user ashley
NAME      UID                                    FULL NAME   IDENTITIES
peter     75e4b80c-dbf1-11e5-8dc6-0e81e52cc949               htpasswd_auth:ashley
----
====

Type identity (from the user record):

====
----
oc get identity htpasswd_auth:ashley
NAME                  IDP NAME        IDP USER NAME   USER NAME   USER UID
htpasswd_auth:ashley  htpasswd_auth   ashley          ashley      75e4b80c-dbf1-11e5-8dc6-0e81e52cc949
----
====

Note the matching UID between the two object types. If you attempt to change the
authentication provider after starting to use OpenShift, the user names that
overlap will not work because of the entries in the identity list, which will
still point to the old authentication method.

=== Properly Deleting a User

To delete a user, all three sources of the user must be removed:

. Identification manager
. User record
. Identity record

Once you complete these steps, a new account will be created in OpenShift
when the user logs in again.

==== Deleting the Identification Manager Entry

If you are using `htpasswd`, delete the entry in the *_htpasswd_* file that is
configured for OpenShift with the username and password.

For external identification management like Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol (LDAP) or Internet Download Manager (IDM), use the user management
tools to remove the user entry.

==== Deleting the User Record

Delete the user record with `oc delete user`:

====
----
$ oc delete user ashley
user "ashley" deleted
----
====

==== Deleting the User Identity

The identity of the user is related to the identification provider you use. Get
the provider name from the user record in `oc get user`.

In this example, the identity provider name is *htpasswd_auth*. The command is:

====
----
# oc delete identity htpasswd_auth:ashley
identity "htpasswd_auth:ashley" deleted
----
====

If you skip this step, the user will not be able to log in again.
