[[managing-users-overview]]
== Overview

This topic describes the management of
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-projects-and-users[user] accounts,
including how new user accounts are created in {product-title} and how they can
be deleted.

[[managing-users-adding-a-user]]
== Adding a User

After new users log in to {product-title}, an account is created for that user
per the xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#identity-providers[identity
provider] configured on the master. The cluster administrator can
xref:../admin_guide/manage_rbac.adoc#admin-guide-manage-rbac[manage the access level of
each user].


[[managing-users-viewing-user-and-identity-lists]]
== Viewing User and Identity Lists

{product-title} user configuration is stored in several locations within
{product-title}. Regardless of the identity provider, {product-title} internally
stores details like role-based access control (RBAC) information and group
membership. To completely remove user information, this data must be removed in
addition to the user account.

In {product-title}, two object types contain user data outside the
identification provider: `*user*` and `*identity*`.

To get the current list of users:

====
----
$ oc get user
NAME      UID                                    FULL NAME   IDENTITIES
demo     75e4b80c-dbf1-11e5-8dc6-0e81e52cc949               htpasswd_auth:demo
----
====

To get the current list of identities:

====
----
$ oc get identity
NAME                  IDP NAME        IDP USER NAME   USER NAME   USER UID
htpasswd_auth:demo    htpasswd_auth   demo            demo        75e4b80c-dbf1-11e5-8dc6-0e81e52cc949
----
====

Note the matching UID between the two object types. If you attempt to change the
authentication provider after starting to use {product-title}, the user names
that overlap will not work because of the entries in the identity list, which
will still point to the old authentication method.

[[managing-users-managing-user-and-group-labels]]
== Managing User and Group Labels

To add a label to a user or group:

----
$ oc label user/<user_name> <label_name>
----

For example, if the user name is *theuser* and the label is *level=gold*:

----
$ oc label user/theuser level=gold
----

To remove the label:

----
$ oc label user/<user_name> <label_name>-
----

To show labels for a user or group:

----
$ oc describe user/<user_name>
----

[[managing-users-deleting-a-user]]
== Deleting a User

To delete a user:

. Delete the user record:
+
====
----
$ oc delete user demo
user "demo" deleted
----
====
+
. Delete the user identity.
+
The identity of the user is related to the identification provider you use. Get
the provider name from the user record in `oc get user`.
+
In this example, the identity provider name is *htpasswd_auth*. The command is:
+
====
----
# oc delete identity htpasswd_auth:demo
identity "htpasswd_auth:demo" deleted
----
====
+
If you skip this step, the user will not be able to log in again.

After you complete these steps, a new account will be created in {product-title}
when the user logs in again.

If your intention is to prevent the user from being able to log in again (for
example, if an employee has left the company and you want to permanently delete
the account), you can also remove the user from your authentication back end
(like *htpasswd*, *kerberos*, or others) for the configured identity
provider.

For example, if you are using *htpasswd*, delete the entry in the *_htpasswd_*
file that is configured for {product-title} with the user name and password.

For external identification management like Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol (LDAP) or Red Hat Identity Management (IdM), use the user management
tools to remove the user entry.
