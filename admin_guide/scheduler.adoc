== Overview
The Kubernetes pod scheduler is responsible for determining placement of new
pods onto nodes within the cluster. It reads data from the pod and tries to find
a node that is a good fit based on configured policies. It is completely
independent and exists as a standalone/pluggable solution. It does not modify
the pod and just creates a binding for the pod that ties the pod to the
particular node.

== Generic Scheduler
The existing generic scheduler is the default platform-provided scheduler
"engine" that selects a node to host the pod in a 3-step operation:

. Filter the nodes
. Prioritize the filtered list of nodes
. Select the best fit node

=== Filter the nodes
The available nodes are filtered based on the constraints or requirements
specified. This is done by running each of the nodes through the list of filter
functions called 'predicates'.

=== Prioritize the filtered list of nodes
This is achieved by passing each node through a series of 'priority' functions
that assign it a score between 0 - 10, with 0 indicating a bad fit and 10
indicating a good fit to host the pod. The scheduler configuration can also take
in a simple "weight" (positive numeric value) for each priority function. The
node score provided by each priority function is multiplied by the "weight"
(default weight is 1) and then combined by just adding the scores for each node
provided by all the priority functions. This weight attribute can be used by
administrators to give higher importance to some priority functions.

=== Select the best fit node
The nodes are sorted based on their scores and the node with the highest score
is selected to host the pod. If multiple nodes have the same high score, then
one of them is selected at random.

== Available Predicates
There are several predicates provided out of the box in Kubernetes. Some of
these predicates can be customized by providing certain parameters. Multiple
predicates can be combined to provide additional filtering of nodes.

=== Static Predicates
These predicates do not take any configuration parameters or inputs from the
user. These are specified in the scheduler configuration using their exact
name.

**_PodFitsPorts_** deems a node to be fit for hosting a pod based on the absence
of port conflicts.
----
{"name" : "PodFitsPorts"}
----

**_PodFitsResources_** determines a fit based on resource availability. The
nodes can declare their resource capacities and then pods can specify what
resources they require. Fit is based on requested, rather than used
resources.
----
{"name" : "PodFitsResources"}
----

**_NoDiskConflict_** determines fit based on non-conflicting disk volumes.
It evaluates if a pod can fit due to the volumes it requests, and those that are
already mounted. It is GCE and Amazon EBS specific.
----
{"name" : "NoDiskConflict"}
----

**_MatchNodeSelector_** determines fit based on node selector query that is
defined in the pod.
----
{"name" : "MatchNodeSelector"}
----

**_HostName_** determines fit based on the presence of the Host parameter
and a string match with the name of the host.
----
{"name" : "HostName"}
----

=== Configurable Predicates
These predicates can be configured by the user to tweak their functioning. They
can be given any user-defined name. The type of the predicate is identified by
the argument that they take. Since these are configurable, multiple predicates
of the same type (but different configuration parameters) can be combined as
long as their user-defined names are different.

**_ServiceAffinity_** filters out nodes that do not belong to the specified
topological level defined by the provided labels. This predicate takes in a list
of labels and ensures affinity within the nodes (that have the same label
values) for pods belonging to the same service. If the pod specifies a value for
the labels in its NodeSelector, then the nodes matching those labels are the
ones where the pod is scheduled. If the pod does not specify the labels in its
NodeSelector, then the first pod can be placed on any node based on availability
and all subsequent pods of the service will be scheduled on nodes that have the
same label values.
----
{"name" : "Zone", "argument" : {"serviceAffinity" : {"labels" : ["zone"]}}}
----

**_LabelsPresence_** checks whether a particular node has a certain label
defined or not, regardless of its value. Matching by label can be useful, for
example, where nodes have their physical location or status defined by labels.
----
{"name" : "RequireRegion", "argument" : {"labelsPresence" : {"labels" : ["region"], "presence" : true}}}
----
* If "presence" is false, and any of the requested labels match any of the
nodes's labels, it returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.
* If "presence" is true, and any of the requested labels do not match any of
the node's labels, it returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.

== Available Priority Functions
A custom set of priority functions can be specified to configure the scheduler.
There are several priority functions provided out-of-the-box in Kubernetes.
Some of these priority functions can be customized by providing certain
parameters. Multiple priority functions can be combined and different weights
can be given to each in order to impact the prioritization. A weight is required
to be specified and cannot be 0 or negative.

=== Static Priority Functions
These priority functions do not take any configuration parameters or inputs from
the user. These are specified in the scheduler configuration using their exact
name as well as the weight.

**_LeastRequestedPriority_** favors nodes with fewer requested resources. It
calculates the percentage of memory and CPU requested by pods scheduled on the
node, and prioritizes nodes that have the highest available/remaining capacity.
----
{"name" : "LeastRequestedPriority", "weight" : 1}
----

**_BalancedResourceAllocation_** favors nodes with balanced resource usage rate.
It calculates the difference between the consumed CPU and memory as a fraction
of capacity, and prioritizes the nodes based on how close the two metrics are to
each other. This should always be used together with _LeastRequestedPriority_.
----
{"name" : "BalancedResourceAllocation", "weight" : 1}
----

**_ServiceSpreadingPriority_** spreads pods by minimizing the number of pods
belonging to the same service onto the same machine.
----
{"name" : "ServiceSpreadingPriority", "weight" : 1}
----

**_EqualPriority_** gives an equal weight of one to all nodes, if no priority
configs are provided. It is not required/recommended outside of testing.
----
{"name" : "EqualPriority", "weight" : 1}
----

=== Configurable Priority Functions
These priority functions can be configured by the user by providing certain
parameters.  They can be given any user-defined name. The type of the priority
function is identified by the argument that they take. Since these are
configurable, multiple priority functions of the same type (but different
configuration parameters) can be combined as long as their user-defined names
are different.

**_ServiceAntiAffinity_** takes a label and ensures a good spread of the pods
belonging to the same service across the group of nodes based on the label
values. It gives the same score to all nodes that have the same value for the
specified label. It gives a higher score to nodes within a group with the least
concentration of pods.
----
{"name" : "RackSpread", "weight" : 1, "argument" : {"serviceAntiAffinity" : {"label" : "rack"}}}
----

**_LabelPreference_** prefers nodes that have a particular label defined or not,
regardless of its value.
----
{"name" : "RackPreferred", "weight" : 1, "argument" : {"labelPreference" : {"label" : "rack"}}}
----


== Scheduler Policy
The selection of the predicate and priority functions defines the policy for the
scheduler. Administrators can provide a JSON file that specifies the predicates
and priority functions to configure the scheduler. The path to the scheduler
policy file can be specified in the master configuration file. In the absence of
the scheduler policy file, the default configuration gets applied.

It is important to note that the predicates and priority functions defined in
the scheduler configuration file will completely override the default scheduler
policy. If any of the default predicates and priority functions are required,
they have to be explicitly specified in the scheduler configuration file.

=== Default Scheduler Policy
The default scheduler policy includes the following predicates:

. PodFitsPorts
. PodFitsResources
. NoDiskConflict
. MatchNodeSelector
. HostName

The default scheduler policy includes the following priority functions.
Each of the priority function has a weight of '1' applied to it:

. LeastRequestedPriority
. BalancedResourceAllocation
. ServiceSpreadingPriority

== Use Cases
One of the important use cases for scheduling within OpenShift is to support
flexible affinity and anti-affinity policies.

=== Infrastructure Topological Levels
Administrators can define multiple topological levels for their infrastructure
(nodes).  This is done by specifying labels on nodes (eg: region = r1,
zone = z1, rack = s1). These label names have no particular meaning and
administrators are free to name their infrastructure levels anything
(eg, city/building/room). Also, administrators can define any number of levels
for their infrastructure topology, with three levels usually being adequate
(eg. regions -> zones -> racks).  Lastly, administrators can specify affinity
and anti-affinity rules at each of these levels in any combination.

=== Affinity
Administrators should be able to configure the scheduler to specify affinity at
any topological level, or even at multiple levels. Affinity at a particular
level indicates that all pods that belong to the same service will be scheduled
onto nodes that belong to the same level. This handles any latency requirements
of applications by allowing administrators to ensure that peer pods do not end
up being too geographically separated. If no node is available within the same
affinity group to host the pod, then the pod will not get scheduled.

=== Anti Affinity
Administrators should be able to configure the scheduler to specify
anti-affinity at any topological level, or even at multiple levels.
Anti-Affinity (or 'spread') at a particular level indicates that all pods that
belong to the same service will be spread across nodes that belong to that
level. This ensures that the application is well spread for high availability
purposes. The scheduler will try to balance the service pods across all
applicable nodes as evenly as possible.

== Sample Policy Configurations
The configuration below specifies the default scheduler configuration, if it
were to be specified via the scheduler policy file.
----
{
	"kind" : "Policy",
	"version" : "v1",
	"predicates" : [
		{"name" : "PodFitsPorts"},
		{"name" : "PodFitsResources"},
		{"name" : "NoDiskConflict"},
		{"name" : "MatchNodeSelector"},
		{"name" : "HostName"}
	],
	"priorities" : [
		{"name" : "LeastRequestedPriority", "weight" : 1},
		{"name" : "BalancedResourceAllocation", "weight" : 1},
		{"name" : "ServiceSpreadingPriority", "weight" : 1}
	]
}
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
In all of the sample configurations below, the list of predicates and priority
functions is truncated to include only the ones that pertain to the use case
specified.  In practice, a complete/meaningful scheduler policy should include
most, if not all, of the default predicates and priority functions listed above.
====

Three topological levels defined as region (affinity) --> zone (affinity) --> rack (anti-affinity)
----
{
	"kind" : "Policy",
	"version" : "v1",
	"predicates" : [
		...
		{"name" : "RegionZoneAffinity", "argument" : {"serviceAffinity" : {"labels" : ["region", "zone"]}}}
	],
	"priorities" : [
		...
		{"name" : "RackSpread", "weight" : 1, "argument" : {"serviceAntiAffinity" : {"label" : "rack"}}}
	]
}
----

Three topological levels defined as city (affinity) -> building
(anti-affinity) -> room (anti-affinity):
----
{
	"kind" : "Policy",
	"version" : "v1",
	"predicates" : [
		...
		{"name" : "CityAffinity", "argument" : {"serviceAffinity" : {"labels" : ["city"]}}}
	],
	"priorities" : [
		...
		{"name" : "BuildingSpread", "weight" : 1, "argument" : {"serviceAntiAffinity" : {"label" : "building"}}},
		{"name" : "RoomSpread", "weight" : 1, "argument" : {"serviceAntiAffinity" : {"label" : "room"}}}
	]
}
----

Only use nodes with the 'region' label defined and prefer nodes with the 'zone'
label defined:
----
{
	"kind" : "Policy",
	"version" : "v1",
	"predicates" : [
		...
		{"name" : "RequireRegion", "argument" : {"labelsPresence" : {"labels" : ["region"], "presence" : true}}}

	],
	"priorities" : [
		...
		{"name" : "ZonePreferred", "weight" : 1, "argument" : {"labelPreference" : {"label" : "zone", "presence" : true}}}
	]
}
----

Configuration example combining static and configurable predicates and
priority functions:
----
{
	"kind" : "Policy",
	"version" : "v1",
	"predicates" : [
		...
		{"name" : "RegionAffinity", "argument" : {"serviceAffinity" : {"labels" : ["region"]}}},
		{"name" : "RequireRegion", "argument" : {"labelsPresence" : {"labels" : ["region"], "presence" : true}}},
		{"name" : "BuildingNodesAvoid", "argument" : {"labelsPresence" : {"labels" : ["building"], "presence" : false}}},
		{"name" : "PodFitsPorts"},
		{"name" : "MatchNodeSelector"}
	],
	"priorities" : [
		...
		{"name" : "ZoneSpread", "weight" : 2, "argument" : {"serviceAntiAffinity" : {"label" : "zone"}}},
		{"name" : "ZonePreferred", "weight" : 1, "argument" : {"labelPreference" : {"label" : "zone", "presence" : true}}},
		{"name" : "ServiceSpreadingPriority", "weight" : 1}
	]
}
----

== Scheduler Extensibility
As is the case with almost everything else in Kubernetes/OpenShift, the
scheduler is built using a plug-in model and the current implementation itself
is a plug-in. There are two ways to extend the scheduler functionality:

* Enhancements
* Replacement

=== Enhancements
The scheduler functionality can be enhanced by adding new predicates and
priority functions. They can either be contributed upstream or maintained
separately. These predicates and priority functions would need to be registered
with the scheduler factory and then specified in the scheduler policy file.

=== Replacement
Since the scheduler is a plug-in, it can be replaced in favor of an alternate
implementation. The scheduler code has a clean separation that watches new pods
as they get created and identifies the most suitable node to host them. It then
creates bindings (pod to node bindings) for the pods using the master API.

[[controlling-pod-placement]]
== Controlling Pod Placement

As a cluster administrator, you can set a policy to prevent application
developers with certain roles from targeting specific nodes when scheduling
pods. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
This process involves the *pods/binding* permission
link:../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.html[role], which is needed to
target particular nodes. The constraint on the use of the `nodeSelector` field
of a pod configuration is based on the *pods/binding* permission and the
`nodeSelectorLabelBlacklist` configuration option.
====

The `nodeSelectorLabelBlacklist` field of a master configuration file gives you
control over the labels that certain roles can specify in a pod configuration's
`nodeSelector` field. Users, service accounts, and groups that have the
*pods/binding* permission can specify any node selector. Those without the
*pods/binding* permission are prohibited from setting a `nodeSelector` for any
label that appears in `nodeSelectorLabelBlacklist`.

As a hypothetical example, an OpenShift cluster might consist of five data
centers spread across two regions. In the U.S., "us-east", "us-central", and
"us-west"; and in the Asia-Pacific region (APAC), "apac-east" and "apac-west".
Each node in each geographical region
link:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.html#updating-labels-on-nodes[is labeled
accordingly]. For example, `region: us-east`.

As a cluster administrator, you can create an infrastructure where application
developers should be deploying pods only onto the nodes closest to their
geographical location. You can
link:../admin_guide/managing_projects.html#using-node-selectors[create a node
selector], grouping the U.S. data centers into `superregion: us` and the APAC
data centers into `superregion: apac`.

To maintain an even loading of resources per data center, you can add the
desired `region` to the `nodeSelectorLabelBlacklist` section of a master
configuration. Then, whenever a developer located in the U.S. creates a pod, it
is deployed onto a node in one of the regions with the `superregion: us` label.
If the developer tries to target a specific region for their pod (for example,
`region: us-east`), they will receive an error. If they try again, without the
node selector on their pod, it can still be deployed onto the region they tried
to target, because `superregion: us` is set as the project-level node selector,
and nodes labeled `region: us-east` are also labeled `superregion: us`.

[[constraining-pod-placement-labels]]
=== Constraining Pod Placement Using Node Name

Ensure a pod is deployed onto only a specified node host by assigning it a label
and specifying this in the `nodeName` setting in a pod configuration.

. Ensure you have the desired
link:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.html#updating-labels-on-nodes[labels] and
link:../admin_guide/managing_projects.html#using-node-selectors[node selector]
set up in your environment.
+
For example, make sure that your pod configuration features the `nodeName`
value indicating the desired label:
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  nodeName: <key: value>
----

. Modify the master configuration file
(*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*) in two places:
+
.. Add `nodeSelectorLabelBlacklist` to the `admissionConfig` section:
+
====
----
...
admissionConfig:
  pluginConfig:
    PodNodeConstraints:
      configuration:
        apiversion: v1
        kind: PodNodeConstraintsConfig
...
----
====

.. Then, add the same to the `kubernetesMasterConfig` section to restrict direct pod creation:
+
====
----
...
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  admissionConfig:
    pluginConfig:
      PodNodeConstraints:
        configuration:
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: PodNodeConstraintsConfig
...
----
====

. Restart OpenShift for the changes to take effect:

=== Constraining Pod Placement Using a Node Selector

Using `nodeSelector` in a pod configuration, you can ensure that pods are only
placed onto nodes with specific labels.

. Ensure you have the desired
link:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.html#updating-labels-on-nodes[labels] and
link:../admin_guide/managing_projects.html#using-node-selectors[node selector]
set up in your environment.

value indicating the desired label:
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    <key>: <value>
...
----

. Modify the master configuration file
(*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*) in two places:
