== Overview

// tag::admin_limits_overview[]
A limit range, defined by a `*LimitRange*` object, enumerates
xref:../dev_guide/compute_resources.adoc#dev-compute-resources[compute resource
constraints] in a xref:../dev_guide/projects.adoc#dev-guide-projects[project] at the pod,
container, image, image stream, and persistent volume claim level, and specifies the amount of resources
that a pod, container, image, image stream, or persistent volume claim can consume.

All resource create and modification requests are evaluated against each
`*LimitRange*` object in the project. If the resource violates any of the
enumerated constraints, then the resource is rejected. If the resource does not
set an explicit value, and if the constraint supports a default value, then the
default value is applied to the resource.

Both core and {product-title} resources can be specified in just one limit range
object. They are separated here into two examples for clarity.


[[container-limits]]
=== Container Limits

// tag::admin_limits_container_limits[]
*Supported Resources:*

* CPU
* Memory

*Supported Constraints:*

Per container, the following must hold true if specified:

.Container
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Constraint |Behavior

|`*Min*`
|`Min[resource]` less than or equal to `container.resources.requests[resource]`
(required) less than or equal to `container/resources.limits[resource]`
(optional)

If the configuration defines a `min` CPU, then the request value must be greater
than the CPU value. A limit value does not need to be specified.

|`*Max*`
|`container.resources.limits[resource]` (required) less than or equal to
`Max[resource]`

If the configuration defines a `max` CPU, then you do not need to define a
request value, but a limit value does need to be set that satisfies the maximum
CPU constraint.

|`*MaxLimitRequestRatio*`
|`MaxLimitRequestRatio[resource]` less than or equal to (
`container.resources.limits[resource]` /
`container.resources.requests[resource]`)

If a configuration defines a `maxLimitRequestRatio` value, then any new
containers must have both a request and limit value. Additionally,
{product-title} calculates a limit to request ratio by dividing the limit by the
request.

For example, if a container has `cpu: 500` in the `limit` value, and
`cpu: 100` in the `request` value, then its limit to request ratio for `cpu` is
`5`. This ratio must be less than or equal to the `maxLimitRequestRatio`.
|===

*Supported Defaults:*

`Default[resource]`:: Defaults `container.resources.limit[resource]` to specified value if none.
`Default Requests[resource]`:: Defaults `container.resources.requests[resource]` to specified value if none.
// end::admin_limits_container_limits[]

[[pod-limits]]
=== Pod Limits

// tag::admin_limits_pod_limits[]
*Supported Resources:*

* CPU
* Memory

*Supported Constraints:*

Across all containers in a pod, the following must hold true:

.Pod
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Constraint |Enforced Behavior

|`*Min*`
|`Min[resource]` less than or equal to `container.resources.requests[resource]`
(required) less than or equal to `container.resources.limits[resource]`
(optional)

|`*Max*`
|`container.resources.limits[resource]` (required) less than or equal to
`Max[resource]`

|`*MaxLimitRequestRatio*`
|`MaxLimitRequestRatio[resource]` less than or equal to (
`container.resources.limits[resource]` /
`container.resources.requests[resource]`)

|===
// end::admin_limits_pod_limits[]

[[image-limits]]
=== Image Limits

// tag::admin_limits_image_limits[]

*Supported Resources:*

* Storage

*Resource type name:*

- `openshift.io/Image`

Per image, the following must hold true if specified:

.Image
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Constraint |Behavior

|`*Max*`
|`image.dockerimagemetadata.size` less than or equal to `Max[resource]`
|===

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
[NOTE]
====
To prevent blobs exceeding the limit from being uploaded to the registry, the
registry must be configured to enforce quota. An environment variable
`REGISTRY_MIDDLEWARE_REPOSITORY_OPENSHIFT_ENFORCEQUOTA` must be set to
`true` which is done by default for new deployments.
====
endif::[]

[WARNING]
====
The image size is not always available in the manifest of an uploaded image.
This is especially the case for images built with Docker 1.10 or higher and
pushed to a v2 registry. If such an image is pulled with an older Docker daemon,
the image manifest will be converted by the registry to schema v1 lacking all
the size information. No storage limit set on images will prevent it from being
uploaded.

link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/issues/7706[The issue] is being
addressed.
====

// end::admin_limits_image_limits[]

[[image-stream-limits]]
=== Image Stream Limits

// tag::admin_limits_image_stream_limits[]

*Supported Resources:*

* `openshift.io/image-tags`
* `openshift.io/images`

*Resource type name:*

- `openshift.io/ImageStream`

Per image stream, the following must hold true if specified:

.ImageStream
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Constraint |Behavior

|`*Max[openshift.io/image-tags]*`
|`length( uniqueimagetags( imagestream.spec.tags ) )` less than or equal to `Max[openshift.io/image-tags]`

`uniqueimagetags` returns unique references to images of given spec tags.

|`*Max[openshift.io/images]*`
|`length( uniqueimages( imagestream.status.tags ) )` less than or equal to `Max[openshift.io/images]`

`uniqueimages` returns unique image names found in status tags. The name equals
image's digest.

|===

==== Counting of Image References

Resource `openshift.io/image-tags` represents unique
xref:../dev_guide/managing_images.adoc#referencing-images-in-image-streams[image
references]. Possible references are an `*ImageStreamTag*`, an
`*ImageStreamImage*` and a `*DockerImage*`. They may be created using commands
`oc tag` and `oc import-image` or by using
xref:../dev_guide/managing_images.adoc#adding-tag[tag tracking]. No distinction
is made between internal and external references. However, each unique reference
tagged in the image stream's specification is counted just once. It does not
restrict pushes to an internal container registry in any way, but is useful for tag
restriction.

Resource `openshift.io/images` represents unique image names recorded in image
stream status. It allows for restriction of a number of images that can be
pushed to the internal registry. Internal and external references are not
distinguished.

// end::admin_limits_image_stream_limits[]


[[claim-limits]]
=== PersistentVolumeClaim Limits

// tag::admin_limits_claim_limits[]
*Supported Resources:*

* Storage

*Supported Constraints:*

Across all persistent volume claims in a project, the following must hold true:

.Pod
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Constraint |Enforced Behavior

|`*Min*`
|Min[resource] <= claim.spec.resources.requests[resource] (required)

|`*Max*`
|claim.spec.resources.requests[resource] (required) <= Max[resource]

[[creating-a-limit-range]]
== Creating a Limit Range

To apply a limit range to a project, create a limit range
object definition on your file system to your desired specifications, then run:

----
$ oc create -f <limit_range_file> -n <project>
----

[[viewing-limits]]
== Viewing Limits

// tag::admin_limits_viewing[]
You can view any limit ranges defined in a project by navigating in the web
console to the project's *Quota* page.

You can also use the CLI to view limit range details:

. First, get the list of limit ranges defined in the project. For example, for a
project called *demoproject*:
+
----
$ oc get limits -n demoproject
NAME              AGE
resource-limits   6d
----

. Then, describe the limit range you are interested in, for example the
*resource-limits* limit range:
+
----
$ oc describe limits resource-limits -n demoproject
Name:                           resource-limits
Namespace:                      demoproject
