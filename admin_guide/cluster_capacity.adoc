== Overview

As a cluster administrator, you can use the `hypercc cluster-capacity` tool to view the
number of pods that can be scheduled to increase the current resources before
they become exhausted, and to ensure any future pods can be scheduled. This
capacity comes from an individual node host in a cluster, and includes CPU,
memory, disk space, and others.

The `hypercc cluster-capacity` tool simulates a sequence of scheduling decisions to
determine how many instances of an input pod can be scheduled on the cluster
before it is exhausted of resources to provide a more accurate estimation.

[NOTE]
====
The remaining allocatable capacity is a rough estimation, because it does not
count all of the resources being distributed among nodes. It analyzes only the
remaining resources and estimates the available capacity that is still
consumable in terms of a number of instances of a pod with given requirements
that can be scheduled in a cluster.

Also, pods might only have scheduling support on particular sets of nodes based
on its selection and affinity criteria. As a result, the estimation of which
remaining pods a cluster can schedule can be difficult.
====

You can run the `hypercc cluster-capacity` analysis tool as a stand-alone utility from the command line, or xref:admin-guide-running-cluster-capacity-inside-pod[as a job] in a pod inside an {product-title} cluster. Running it as job inside of a pod enables you to run it multiple times without intervention.

== Running Cluster Capacity Analysis on the Command Line

Install the openshift-enterprise-cluster-capacity RPM package to get the tool.
To run the tool on the command line:

----
$ hypercc cluster-capacity --kubeconfig <path-to-kubeconfig> \
    --podspec <path-to-pod-spec>
----

The `--kubeconfig` option indicates your Kubernetes configuration file, and the
`--podspec` option indicates a sample pod specification file, which the tool
uses for estimating resource usage. The `podspec` specifies its resource
requirements as `limits` or `requests`. The `hypercc cluster-capacity` tool takes the
pod's resource requirements into account for its estimation analysis.

An example of the pod specification input is:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: small-pod
  labels:
    app: guestbook
    tier: frontend
spec:
  containers:
  - name: php-redis
    image: gcr.io/google-samples/gb-frontend:v4
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 150m
        memory: 100Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 150m
        memory: 100Mi
----

You can also add the `--verbose` option to output a detailed description of how
many pods can be scheduled on each node in the cluster:

----
$ hypercc cluster-capacity --kubeconfig <path-to-kubeconfig> \
    --podspec <path-to-pod-spec> --verbose
----

The output will look similar to the following:

----
small-pod pod requirements:
	- CPU: 150m
	- Memory: 100Mi

The cluster can schedule 52 instance(s) of the pod small-pod.

Termination reason: Unschedulable: No nodes are available that match all of the
following predicates:: Insufficient cpu (2).

Pod distribution among nodes:
small-pod
	- 192.168.124.214: 26 instance(s)
	- 192.168.124.120: 26 instance(s)
----

In the above example, the number of estimated pods that can be scheduled onto
the cluster is 52.

== Running Cluster Capacity as a Job Inside of a Pod

Running the cluster capacity tool as a job inside of a pod has the advantage of
being able to be run multiple times without needing user intervention. Running
the cluster capacity tool as a job involves using a `ConfigMap`.

. Create the cluster role:
+
----
$ cat << EOF| oc create -f -
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: cluster-capacity-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods", "nodes", "persistentvolumeclaims", "persistentvolumes", "services"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
EOF
----

. Create the service account:
+
----
$ oc create sa cluster-capacity-sa
----

. Add the role to the service account:
+
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-capacity-role \
    system:serviceaccount:default:cluster-capacity-sa
----

. Define and create the pod specification:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: small-pod
  labels:
    app: guestbook
    tier: frontend
spec:
  containers:
  - name: php-redis
    image: gcr.io/google-samples/gb-frontend:v4
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 150m
        memory: 100Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 150m
        memory: 100Mi
----

. The cluster capacity analysis is mounted in a volume using a
`ConfigMap` named `cluster-capacity-configmap` to mount input pod spec file
`pod.yaml` into a volume `test-volume` at the path `/test-pod`.
+
If you haven't created a `ConfigMap`, create one before creating the job:
+
----
$ oc create configmap cluster-capacity-configmap \
    --from-file=pod.yaml=pod.yaml
----

. Create the job using the below example of a job specification file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: cluster-capacity-job
spec:
  parallelism: 1
  completions: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      name: cluster-capacity-pod
    spec:
        containers:
        - name: cluster-capacity
          image: openshift/origin-cluster-capacity
          imagePullPolicy: "Always"
          volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /test-pod
            name: test-volume
          env:
          - name: CC_INCLUSTER <1>
            value: "true"
          command:
          - "/bin/sh"
          - "-ec"
          - |
            /bin/cluster-capacity --podspec=/test-pod/pod.yaml --verbose
        restartPolicy: "Never"
        serviceAccountName: cluster-capacity-sa
        volumes:
        - name: test-volume
          configMap:
            name: cluster-capacity-configmap
----
<1> A required environment variable letting the cluster capacity tool
 know that it is running inside a cluster as a pod.
 +
The `pod.yaml` key of the `ConfigMap` is the same as the pod specification file
name, though it is not required. By doing this, the input pod spec file can be
accessed inside the pod as `/test-pod/pod.yaml`.

. Run the cluster capacity image as a job in a pod:
+
----
$ oc create -f cluster-capacity-job.yaml
----

. Check the job logs to find the number of pods that can be scheduled in the
 cluster:
+
----
$ oc logs jobs/cluster-capacity-job
small-pod pod requirements:
        - CPU: 150m
        - Memory: 100Mi

The cluster can schedule 52 instance(s) of the pod small-pod.

Termination reason: Unschedulable: No nodes are available that match all of the
following predicates:: Insufficient cpu (2).

Pod distribution among nodes:
small-pod
        - 192.168.124.214: 26 instance(s)
        - 192.168.124.120: 26 instance(s)
