== Overview
Security context constraints allow administrators to control permissions for pods.  To learn
more about this API type please refer to the
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#security-context-constraints[security
context constraints] (SCCs) architecture documentation.  You may manage SCCs in your instance as normal API
link:../architecture/core_concepts/index.html[objects] using
link:../cli_reference/index.html[the CLI].

[NOTE]
====
You must have
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[*cluster-admin*
privileges] to manage SCCs.

[[listing-security-context-constraints]]

== Listing Security Context Constraints

To get a current list of SCCs:

====
----
$ oc get scc
NAME         PRIV      CAPS      HOSTDIR   SELINUX     RUNASUSER
privileged   true      []        true      RunAsAny    RunAsAny
restricted   false     []        false     MustRunAs   MustRunAsRange
----

[[examining-a-security-context-constraints-object]]

== Examining a Security Context Constraints Object

To examine a particular SCC, use `oc get`, `oc describe`, `oc export`, or `oc edit`.

====
----
$ oc edit scc restricted
allowHostDirVolumePlugin: false
allowHostNetwork: false
allowHostPorts: false
allowPrivilegedContainer: false
allowedCapabilities: null
apiVersion: v1
groups:
- system:authenticated
kind: SecurityContextConstraints
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2015-09-08T07:37:54Z
  name: restricted <1>
  resourceVersion: "58"
  selfLink: /api/v1/securitycontextconstraints/restricted
  uid: 849d9228-55fc-11e5-976b-080027c5bfa9
runAsUser:
  type: MustRunAsRange
seLinuxContext:
  type: MustRunAs
----
<1> The SCC name specified in the `oc edit` command.
====


[[creating-new-security-context-constraints]]

== Creating New Security Context Constraints

To create a new SCC, first define the SCC in a JSON or YAML file:

.Security Context Constraint Object Definition
====
----
kind: SecurityContextConstraints
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: scc-admin
allowPrivilegedContainer: true
runAsUser:
  type: RunAsAny
seLinuxContext:
  type: RunAsAny
fsGroup:
  type: RunAsAny
supplementalGroups:
  type: RunAsAny
users:
- my-admin-user
groups:
- my-admin-group
----
Although this example definition was written by hand, another way is to modify the definition obtained from link:#examining-a-security-context-constraints-object[examining a particular SCC].
====

Then, run `oc create` passing the file to create it:

====
----
$ oc create -f scc_admin.yaml
securitycontextconstraints/scc-admin

$ oc get scc
NAME         PRIV      CAPS      HOSTDIR   SELINUX     RUNASUSER
privileged   true      []        true      RunAsAny    RunAsAny
restricted   false     []        false     MustRunAs   MustRunAsRange
scc-admin    true      []        false     RunAsAny    RunAsAny
----
====

[[deleting-security-context-constraints]]

== Deleting Security Context Constraints

To delete an SCC:

----
$ oc delete scc <scc_name>
----

[NOTE]
====
If you delete the default SCCs, they will not be regenerated upon restart,
unless you delete all SCCs. If any constraint already exists within the system,
no regeneration will take place.
====

[[updating-security-context-constraints]]

== Updating Security Context Constraints

To update an existing SCC:

----
$ oc edit scc <scc_name>
----

== Updating the default Security Context Constraints

Default SCCs will be created when the master is started if they are missing. To reset SCCs
to defaults, or update existing SCCs to new default definitions after an upgrade you may:

. Delete any SCC you would like to be reset and let it be recreated by restarting the master
. Use the `oadm policy reconcile-sccs` command

The `oadm policy reconcile-sccs` command will set all SCC policies to the default
values but retain any additional users and groups as well as priorities you may have already set.
To view which SCCs will be changed you may run the command with no options or by
specifying your preferred output with the `-o <format>` option.

After reviewing it is recommended that you back up your existing SCCs and then
use the `--confirm` option to persist the data.

[NOTE]
====
If you would like to reset priorities and grants you may use the `--additive-only=false`
option.
====

[[how-do-i]]

== How Do I?

The following describe common scenarios and procedures using SCCs.

[[grant-access-to-the-privileged-scc]]

=== Grant Access to the Privileged SCC

In some cases, an administrator might want to allow users or groups outside the
administrator group access to create more privileged pods. To do so, you can:

. Determine the user or group you would like to have access to the SCC.

. Run:
+
----
$ oc edit scc <name>
----

. Add the user or group to the *users* or *groups* field of the SCC.

For example, to allow the *e2e-user* access to the *privileged* SCC, add their
user:

====
----
$ oc edit scc privileged

allowHostDirVolumePlugin: true
allowPrivilegedContainer: true
apiVersion: v1
groups:
- system:cluster-admins
- system:nodes
kind: SecurityContextConstraints
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2015-06-15T20:44:53Z
  name: privileged
  resourceVersion: "58"
  selfLink: /api/v1/securitycontextconstraints/privileged
  uid: 602a0838-139f-11e5-8aa4-080027c5bfa9
runAsUser:
  type: RunAsAny
seLinuxContext:
  type: RunAsAny
users:
- system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:build-controller
- e2e-user <1>
----

<1> The *e2e-user* added to the users section.

====

[[grant-a-service-account-access-to-the-privileged-scc]]

=== Grant a Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC

First, create a link:../dev_guide/service_accounts.html[service account].
For example, to create service account `My_SVCACCT` in project `My_Project`:

====
----
$ cat <<EOF | oc create -n My_Project -f -
kind: ServiceAccount
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: My_SVCACCT <1>
EOF
----
====

Then, add the service account to the `privileged` SCC.

----
$ oc edit scc privileged
----

Add the following under `users`:

----
   - system:serviceaccount:My_Project:My_SVCACCT
----

[[enable-images-to-run-with-user-in-the-dockerfile]]

=== Enable Images to Run with USER in the Dockerfile

To relax the security in your cluster so that images are not forced to run as a
pre-allocated UID, without granting everyone access to the *privileged* SCC:

. Edit the *restricted* SCC:
+
----
$ oc edit scc restricted
----

. Change the `*runAsUser.Type*` strategy to *RunAsAny*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This allows images to run as the root UID if no *USER* is specified in the
*_Dockerfile_*.
====

[[enable-dockerhub-images-that-require-root]]

=== Enable dockerhub images that require root

Some Dockerhub images (examples: `postgres` and `redis`) require root access and have certain
expectations about how volumes are owned.  For these images, add the service account to the
`anyuid` SCC.

----
$ oc edit scc anyuid
----

Add the following under `users`:

----
   - system:serviceaccount:My_Project:My_SVCACCT
----

[[use-mount-host-on-the-registry]]

=== Use --mount-host on the Registry

It is recommended that
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html[persistent storage] using
`*PersistentVolume*` and `*PersistentVolumeClaim*` objects be used for
link:../install_config/install/docker_registry.html[registry deployments]. If you are testing and
would like to instead use the `oadm registry` command with the `--mount-host`
option, you must first create a new link:service_accounts.html[service account]
for the registry and add it to the *privileged* SCC. See the
link:../install_config/install/docker_registry.html#storage-for-the-registry[Administrator
Guide] for full instructions.

=== Provide Additional Capabilities

In some cases, an image may require capabilities that Docker does not provide
out of the box. You can provide the ability to request additional capabilities
in the pod specification which will be validated against an SCC.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This allows images to run with elevated capabilities and should be used only if
necessary. You should not edit the default *restricted* SCC to enable additional
capabilities.
====

When used in conjunction with a non-root user, you must also ensure that the
file that requires the additional capability is granted the capabilities using
the `setcap` command. For example, in the *_Dockerfile_* of the image:

----
setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+p /usr/bin/ping
----

Further, if a capability is provided by default in Docker, you do not need to
modify the pod specification to request it. For example, `*NET_RAW*` is provided
by default and capabilities should already be set on `*ping*`, therefore no
special steps should be required to run `*ping*`.

To provide additional capabilities:

. Create a new SCC or edit the *privileged* SCC:
+
----
$ oc edit scc <name>
----

. Add the allowed capability using the `*allowedCapabilities*` field.

. When creating the pod, request the capability in the
`*securityContext.capabilities.add*` field.

[[modify-cluster-default-behavior]]

=== Modify Cluster Default Behavior

To modify your cluster so that it does not pre-allocate UIDs, allows containers
to run as any user, and prevents privileged containers:

. Edit the *restricted* SCC:
+
----
 $ oc edit scc restricted
----

. Change `*runAsUser.Type*` to *RunAsAny*.

. Ensure `*allowPrivilegedContainer*` is set to false.

. Save the changes.

To modify your cluster so that it does not pre-allocate UIDs and does not allow
containers to run as root:

. Edit the *restricted* SCC:
+
----
 $ oc edit scc restricted
----

. Change `*runAsUser.Type*` to *MustRunAsNonRoot*.

. Save the changes.

[[use-the-hostpath-volume-plugin]]

=== Use the hostPath Volume Plug-in

To relax the security in your cluster so that pods are allowed to use the `hostPath`
volume plug-in without granting everyone access to the *privileged* SCC:

. Edit the *restricted* SCC:
+
----
$ oc edit scc restricted
----

. Add `*allowHostDirVolumePlugin: true*`.

. Save the changes.

=== Ensure That Admission Attempts to Use a Specific SCC First

You may control the sort ordering of SCCs in admission by setting the `Priority`
field of the SCCs.  Please see the
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#scc-prioritization[SCC Prioritization]
section for more information on sorting.

=== Add an SCC to a User or Group

To add an SCC to a user:

----
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-user <scc_name> <user_name>
----

To add an SCC to a group:

----
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-group <scc_name> <group_name>
----
