== Overview
Security context constraints allow administrators to control permissions for
pods. To learn more about this API type, see the
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#security-context-constraints[security
context constraints] (SCCs) architecture documentation. You can manage SCCs in
your instance as normal API
link:../architecture/core_concepts/index.html[objects] using
link:../cli_reference/index.html[the CLI].

[NOTE]
====
You must have
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[*cluster-admin*
privileges] to manage SCCs.

ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
As an {product-title} cluster administrator, you can list and view details for
SCCs, but cannot edit or delete the default SCCs.

[[examining-a-security-context-constraints-object]]
== Examining a Security Context Constraints Object

To examine a particular SCC, use `oc get`, `oc describe`, `oc export`, or `oc
edit`. For example, to examine the *restricted* SCC:

====
----
$ oc describe scc restricted

Name:						restricted

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
[NOTE]
====
In order to preserve customized SCCs during upgrades, do not edit settings on
the default SCCs other than priority, users, and groups.
====

[[creating-new-security-context-constraints]]
== Creating New Security Context Constraints

To create a new SCC, first define the SCC in a JSON or YAML file:

.Security Context Constraint Object Definition
====
----
kind: SecurityContextConstraints
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: scc-admin
allowPrivilegedContainer: true
runAsUser:
  type: RunAsAny
seLinuxContext:
  type: RunAsAny
fsGroup:
  type: RunAsAny
supplementalGroups:
  type: RunAsAny
users:
- my-admin-user
groups:
- my-admin-group
----
====

Then, run `oc create` passing the file to create it:

====
----
$ oc create -f scc_admin.yaml
securitycontextconstraints/scc-admin

$ oc get scc
NAME         PRIV      CAPS      HOSTDIR   SELINUX     RUNASUSER
privileged   true      []        true      RunAsAny    RunAsAny
restricted   false     []        false     MustRunAs   MustRunAsRange
scc-admin    true      []        false     RunAsAny    RunAsAny
----
====

[[deleting-security-context-constraints]]

== Deleting Security Context Constraints

To delete an SCC:

----
$ oc delete scc <scc_name>
----

[NOTE]
====
If you delete the default SCCs, they will not be regenerated upon restart,
unless you delete all SCCs. If any constraint already exists within the system,
no regeneration will take place.
====

[[updating-security-context-constraints]]

== Updating Security Context Constraints

To update an existing SCC:

----
$ oc edit scc <scc_name>
----

[NOTE]
====
In order to preserve customized SCCs during upgrades, do not edit settings on
the default SCCs other than priority, users, and groups.
====

[[updating-the-default-security-context-constraints]]
== Updating the Default Security Context Constraints

Default SCCs will be created when the master is started if they are missing. To reset SCCs
to defaults, or update existing SCCs to new default definitions after an upgrade you may:

. Delete any SCC you would like to be reset and let it be recreated by restarting the master
. Use the `oadm policy reconcile-sccs` command

The `oadm policy reconcile-sccs` command will set all SCC policies to the default
values but retain any additional users and groups as well as priorities you may have already set.
To view which SCCs will be changed you may run the command with no options or by
specifying your preferred output with the `-o <format>` option.

After reviewing it is recommended that you back up your existing SCCs and then
use the `--confirm` option to persist the data.

[NOTE]
====
If you would like to reset priorities and grants, use the
`--additive-only=false` option.
====

[NOTE]
====
If you have customized settings other than priority, users, or groups in an SCC,
you will lose those settings when you reconcile.
====

[[how-do-i]]
== How Do I?

The following describe common scenarios and procedures using SCCs.

[[grant-access-to-the-privileged-scc]]

=== Grant Access to the Privileged SCC

In some cases, an administrator might want to allow users or groups outside the
administrator group access to create more privileged pods. To do so, you can:

. Determine the user or group you would like to have access to the SCC.

. Run:
+
----
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-user <scc_name> <user_name>
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-group <scc_name> <group_name>
----

For example, to allow the *e2e-user* access to the *privileged* SCC, run:

----
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-user privileged e2e-user
----

[[grant-a-service-account-access-to-the-privileged-scc]]

=== Grant a Service Account Access to the Privileged SCC

First, create a link:../dev_guide/service_accounts.html[service account].
For example, to create service account `mysvcacct` in project `myproject`:

----
$ oc create serviceaccount mysvcacct -n myproject
----

Then, add the service account to the `privileged` SCC.

----
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:myproject:mysvcacct
----

[[enable-images-to-run-with-user-in-the-dockerfile]]

=== Enable Images to Run with USER in the Dockerfile

To relax the security in your cluster so that images are not forced to run as a
pre-allocated UID, without granting everyone access to the *privileged* SCC:

. Grant all authenticated users access to the *anyuid* SCC:
+
----
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-group anyuid system:authenticated
----

[WARNING]
====
This allows images to run as the root UID if no *USER* is specified in the
*_Dockerfile_*.
====

[[enable-dockerhub-images-that-require-root]]

=== Enable Dockerhub Images that Require Root

Some Dockerhub images (examples: `postgres` and `redis`) require root access and
have certain expectations about how volumes are owned.  For these images, add
the service account to the `anyuid` SCC.

----
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccount:myproject:mysvcacct
----

[[use-mount-host-on-the-registry]]

=== Use --mount-host on the Registry

It is recommended that
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html[persistent storage] using
`*PersistentVolume*` and `*PersistentVolumeClaim*` objects be used for
link:../install_config/install/docker_registry.html[registry deployments]. If
you are testing and would like to instead use the `oadm registry` command with
the `--mount-host` option, you must first create a new
link:service_accounts.html[service account] for the registry and add it to the
*privileged* SCC. See the
link:../install_config/install/docker_registry.html#storage-for-the-registry[Administrator
Guide] for full instructions.

=== Provide Additional Capabilities

In some cases, an image may require capabilities that Docker does not provide
out of the box. You can provide the ability to request additional capabilities
in the pod specification which will be validated against an SCC.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This allows images to run with elevated capabilities and should be used only if
necessary. You should not edit the default *restricted* SCC to enable additional
capabilities.
====

When used in conjunction with a non-root user, you must also ensure that the
file that requires the additional capability is granted the capabilities using
the `setcap` command. For example, in the *_Dockerfile_* of the image:

----
setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+p /usr/bin/ping
----

Further, if a capability is provided by default in Docker, you do not need to
modify the pod specification to request it. For example, `*NET_RAW*` is provided
by default and capabilities should already be set on `*ping*`, therefore no
special steps should be required to run `*ping*`.

To provide additional capabilities:

. Create a new SCC

. Add the allowed capability using the `*allowedCapabilities*` field.

. When creating the pod, request the capability in the
`*securityContext.capabilities.add*` field.

[[modify-cluster-default-behavior]]

=== Modify Cluster Default Behavior

To modify your cluster so that it does not pre-allocate UIDs, allows containers
to run as any user, and prevents privileged containers:

[NOTE]
====
In order to preserve customized SCCs during upgrades, do not edit settings on
the default SCCs other than priority, users, and groups.
====

. Edit the *restricted* SCC:
+
----
 $ oc edit scc restricted
----

. Change `*runAsUser.Type*` to *RunAsAny*.

. Ensure `*allowPrivilegedContainer*` is set to false.

. Save the changes.

To modify your cluster so that it does not pre-allocate UIDs and does not allow
containers to run as root:

. Edit the *restricted* SCC:
+
----
 $ oc edit scc restricted
----

. Change `*runAsUser.Type*` to *MustRunAsNonRoot*.

. Save the changes.

[[use-the-hostpath-volume-plugin]]

=== Use the hostPath Volume Plug-in

To relax the security in your cluster so that pods are allowed to use the
`hostPath` volume plug-in without granting everyone access to the *privileged*
SCC:

. Edit the *restricted* SCC:
+
----
$ oc edit scc restricted
----

. Add `*allowHostDirVolumePlugin: true*`.

. Save the changes.

=== Ensure That Admission Attempts to Use a Specific SCC First

You may control the sort ordering of SCCs in admission by setting the `Priority`
field of the SCCs.  Please see the
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#scc-prioritization[SCC
Prioritization] section for more information on sorting.

=== Add an SCC to a User or Group

To add an SCC to a user:

----
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-user <scc_name> <user_name>
----

To add an SCC to a service account:

----
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-user <scc_name>  \
    system:serviceaccount:<serviceaccount_namespace>:<serviceaccount_name>
----

To add an SCC to a group:

----
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-group <scc_name> <group_name>
----

To add an SCC to all service accounts in a namespace:

----
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-group <scc_name>  \
    system:serviceaccounts:<serviceaccount_namespace>
----
