== Overview

[IMPORTANT]
====
Kuryr SDN Administration is a Technology Preview feature.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to
upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide
feedback during the development process.

For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features support scope, see

xref:../../install_config/configuring_kuryrsdn.adoc#install-config-configuring-kuryr-sdn[Kuryr]
(or Kuryr-Kubernetes) is one of the SDN choices for {product-title}. Kuryr uses
an OpenStack networking service, Neutron, to connect pods to the network. With
this method, pods can have interconnectivity with OpenStack virtual machines
(VMs), which is useful for {product-title} clusters deployed on OpenStack VMs.

[[admin-guide-kuryr-orphaned-resources]]
=== Orphaned OpenStack Resources
All OpenStack resources created by Kuryr are tied to the {product-title}
resources lifecycle. This means that if you delete your {product-title} cluster
in a hard way (that is, by deleting OpenStack VMs the cluster is running on),
you may end up with orphaned resources on your OpenStack deployment. In
particular this includes Neutron ports and Octavia (or LBaaS v2) load
balancers, as well as networks, subnets, and security groups precreated for
Kuryr's use.

To get rid of them you can either look them up by ids that were specified in
`kuryr.conf` or if you've created a separate OpenStack user for Kuryr
resources, by querying OpenStack APIs with that user name.
