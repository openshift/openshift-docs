== Overview
You can use link:../cli_reference/index.html[the CLI] to view
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html[authorization
policies] and the administrator CLI to manage the
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html[roles and bindings]
within a policy.

[[viewing-roles-and-bindings]]

== Viewing Roles and Bindings
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[Roles] grant
various levels of access in the system-wide
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#cluster-policy-and-local-policy[cluster
policy] as well as project-scoped
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#cluster-policy-and-local-policy[local
policies].
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.html#users-and-groups[Users
and groups] can be associated with, or _bound_ to, multiple roles at the same
time.  You can view details about the roles and their bindings using the `oc
describe` command.

Users with the *cluster-admin*
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[default role]
in the cluster policy can view cluster policy and all local policies. Users with
the *admin*
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[default role]
in a given local policy can view that project-scoped policy.

=== Viewing Local Policy

While the list of local roles and their associated rule sets are not viewable
within a local policy, all of the
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[default roles]
are still applicable and can be added to users or groups, other than the
*cluster-admin* default role. The local bindings, however, are viewable.

To view the current set of local bindings, which shows the users and groups that
are bound to various roles:

----
$ oc describe policyBindings :default
----

By default, the current project is used when viewing local policy.
Alternatively, a project can be specified with the `-n` flag. This is useful for
viewing the local policy of another project, if the user already has the *admin*
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[default role]
in it.

By default in a local policy, only the binding for the *admin* role is
immediately listed. However, if other
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[default roles]
are added to users and groups within a local policy, they become listed as well.

[[managing-role-bindings]]

== Managing Role Bindings
Adding, or _binding_, a
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[role] to
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.html#users-and-groups[users
or groups] gives the user or group the relevant access granted by the role. You
can add and remove roles to and from users and groups using `oadm policy`
commands.

When managing a user or group's associated roles for a local policy using the
following operations, a project may be specified with the `-n` flag. If it is
not specified, then the current project is used.

.Local Policy Operations
[options="header"]
|===

|Command |Description

|`$ oadm policy who-can _<verb>_ _<resource>_`
|Indicates which users can perform an action on a resource.

|`$ oadm policy add-role-to-user _<role>_ _<username>_`
|Binds a given role to specified users in the current project.

|`$ oadm policy remove-role-from-user _<role>_ _<username>_`
|Removes a given role from specified users in the current project.

|`$ oadm policy remove-user _<username>_`
|Removes specified users and all of their roles in the current project.

|`$ oadm policy add-role-to-group _<role>_ _<groupname>_`
|Binds a given role to specified groups in the current project.

|`$ oadm policy remove-role-from-group _<role>_ _<groupname>_`
|Removes a given role from specified groups in the current project.

|`$ oadm policy remove-group _<groupname>_`
|Removes specified groups and all of their roles in the current project.

|===

You can also manage role bindings for the cluster policy using the following
operations. The `-n` flag is not used used for these operations because the
cluster policy uses non-namespaced resources.

.Cluster Policy Operations
[options="header"]
|===

|Command |Description

|`$ oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user _<role>_ _<username>_`
|Binds a given role to specified users for all projects in the cluster.

|`$ oadm policy remove-cluster-role-from-user _<role>_ _<username>_`
|Removes a given role from specified users for all projects in the cluster.

|`$ oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-group _<role>_ _<groupname>_`
|Binds a given role to specified groups for all projects in the cluster.

|`$ oadm policy remove-cluster-role-from-group _<role>_ _<groupname>_`
|Removes a given role from specified groups for all projects in the cluster.

|===

For example, you can add the *admin* role to the *alice* user in *joe-project*
by running:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oadm policy add-role-to-user admin alice -n joe-project
----
====

You can then view the local bindings and verify the addition in the output:

====
