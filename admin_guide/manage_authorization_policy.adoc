== Overview
You can use xref:../cli_reference/index.adoc#cli-reference-index[the CLI] to view
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authorization[authorization
policies] and the administrator CLI to manage the
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authorization[roles and bindings]
within a policy.

ifdef::atomic-registry[]
The web console also provides some basic management of authorization roles.
Through the web console users and groups may be assigned **registry-admin**,
**registry-editor** or **registry-viewer**.

== Viewing Roles and Bindings
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[Roles] grant
various levels of access in the system-wide
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#cluster-policy-and-local-policy[cluster
policy] as well as project-scoped
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#cluster-policy-and-local-policy[local
policies].
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.adoc#users-and-groups[Users
and groups] can be associated with, or _bound_ to, multiple roles at the same
time.  You can view details about the roles and their bindings using the `oc
describe` command.

Users with the
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[*cluster-admin* default role]
in the cluster policy can view cluster policy and all local policies. Users with
the
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[*admin* default role]
in a given local policy can view that project-scoped policy.

[[viewing-local-policy]]

=== Viewing Local Policy

While the list of local roles and their associated rule sets are not viewable
within a local policy, all of the
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[default roles]
are still applicable and can be added to users or groups, other than the
*cluster-admin* default role. The local bindings, however, are viewable.

To view the current set of local bindings, which shows the users and groups that
are bound to various roles:

----
$ oc describe policyBindings :default
----

By default, the current project is used when viewing local policy.
Alternatively, a project can be specified with the `-n` flag. This is useful for
viewing the local policy of another project, if the user already has the *admin*
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[default role]
in it.

By default in a local policy, only the binding for the *admin* role is
immediately listed. However, if other
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[default roles]
are added to users and groups within a local policy, they become listed as well.

[[managing-role-bindings]]

== Managing Role Bindings
Adding, or _binding_, a
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[role] to
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.adoc#users-and-groups[users
or groups] gives the user or group the relevant access granted by the role. You
can add and remove roles to and from users and groups using `oadm policy`
commands.

When managing a user or group's associated roles for a local policy using the
following operations, a project may be specified with the `-n` flag. If it is
not specified, then the current project is used.

.Local Policy Operations
[options="header"]
|===

|Command |Description

|`$ oadm policy who-can _<verb>_ _<resource>_`
|Indicates which users can perform an action on a resource.

|`$ oadm policy add-role-to-user _<role>_ _<username>_`
|Binds a given role to specified users in the current project.

|`$ oadm policy remove-role-from-user _<role>_ _<username>_`
|Removes a given role from specified users in the current project.

|`$ oadm policy remove-user _<username>_`
|Removes specified users and all of their roles in the current project.

|`$ oadm policy add-role-to-group _<role>_ _<groupname>_`
|Binds a given role to specified groups in the current project.

|`$ oadm policy remove-role-from-group _<role>_ _<groupname>_`
|Removes a given role from specified groups in the current project.

|`$ oadm policy remove-group _<groupname>_`
|Removes specified groups and all of their roles in the current project.

|===

You can also manage role bindings for the cluster policy using the following
operations. The `-n` flag is not used for these operations because the
cluster policy uses non-namespaced resources.

.Cluster Policy Operations
[options="header"]
|===

|Command |Description

|`$ oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user _<role>_ _<username>_`
|Binds a given role to specified users for all projects in the cluster.

|`$ oadm policy remove-cluster-role-from-user _<role>_ _<username>_`
|Removes a given role from specified users for all projects in the cluster.

|`$ oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-group _<role>_ _<groupname>_`
|Binds a given role to specified groups for all projects in the cluster.

|`$ oadm policy remove-cluster-role-from-group _<role>_ _<groupname>_`
|Removes a given role from specified groups for all projects in the cluster.

|===

For example, you can add the *admin* role to the *alice* user in *joe-project*
by running:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oadm policy add-role-to-user admin alice -n joe-project
----
====

You can then view the local bindings and verify the addition in the output:

== Granting Users Daemonset Permissions

By default, project developers do not have the permission to create
xref:../dev_guide/daemonsets.adoc#dev-guide-daemonsets[daemonsets]. As a cluster
administrator, you can grant them the abilities.

== Creating a Local Role

To create a local role for a project, you can either copy and modify an existing
role or build a new role from scratch. It is recommended that you build it from
scratch so that you understand each of the permissions assigned.

To copy the cluster role *view* to use as a local role, run:

----
$ oc get clusterrole view -o yaml > clusterrole_view.yaml
$ cp clusterrole_view.yaml localrole_exampleview.yaml
$ vim localrole_exampleview.yaml
# 1. Update kind: ClusterRole to kind: Role
# 2. Update name: view to name: exampleview
# 3. Remove resourceVersion, selfLink, uid, and creationTimestamp
$ oc create -f path/to/localrole_exampleview.yaml -n <project_you_want_to_add_the_local_role_exampleview_to>
----

To create a new role from scratch, save this snippet into the file
*_role_exampleview.yaml_*:

.Example Role Named exampleview
----
cat examplerole.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: exampleview
rules:
- apiGroups: null
  attributeRestrictions: null
  resources:
  - pods
  - builds
  verbs:
  - get
  - list
  - watch
----

Then, to add the role to your project, run:

----
$ oc project <project_you_want_to_add_the_local_role_exampleview_to>
----

Optionally, annotate it with a description.

Save the following role binding in the policybinding.yaml file:
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PolicyBinding
metadata:
  name: <string>
policyRef:
  name: <role-name>
  namespace: <project-name>
roleBindings: null
----

To create the PolicyBinding, run:
----
$ oc create -f policybinding.yaml -n <project-name>
----

To create the role, run:
----
 $ oc create -f localrole_exampleview.yaml -n <project-name>
----

To use the new role, run:
----
$ oadm policy add-role-to-user customview <new-user> --role-namespace=<project-name>
----

[NOTE]
====
A `clusterrolebinding` is a role binding that exists at the cluster level. A
`rolebinding` exists at the project level. This can be confusing. The
`clusterrolebinding` _view_ must be assigned to a user within a project for that
user to view the project. Local roles are only created if a cluster role does
not provide the set of permissions needed for a particular situation, which is
unlikely.

Some cluster role names are initially confusing. The `clusterrole`
`clusteradmin` can be assigned to a user within a project, making it appear that
this user has the privileges of a cluster administrator. This is not the case.
The `clusteradmin` cluster role bound to a certain project is more like a super
administrator for that project, granting the permissions of the cluster role
`admin`, plus a few additional permissions like the ability to edit rate limits.
This can appear especially confusing via the web console UI, which does not list
cluster policy (where cluster administrators exist). However, it does list local
policy (where a locally bound `clusteradmin` may exist).

Within a project, project administrators should be able to see `rolebindings`,
not `clusterrolebindings`.
