== Overview

{product-title} relies on run-once pods to perform tasks such as
xref:../dev_guide/deployments.adoc#dev-guide-deployments[deploying a pod] or
xref:../dev_guide/builds.adoc#dev-guide-builds[performing a build]. Run-once pods are pods that
have a `*RestartPolicy*` of `Never` or `OnFailure`.

The cluster administrator can use the *RunOnceDuration* admission control
plug-in to force a limit on the time that those run-once pods can be active.
Once the time limit expires, the cluster will try to actively terminate those
pods. The main reason to have such a limit is to prevent tasks such as builds to
run for an excessive amount of time.

[[configuring-the-run-once-duration-plug-in]]
== Configuring the RunOnceDuration Plug-in

The plug-in configuration should include the default active deadline for
run-once pods. This deadline will be enforced globally, but can be superseded on
a per-project basis.

====

[source,yaml]
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  admissionConfig:
    pluginConfig:
      RunOnceDuration:
        configuration:
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: RunOnceDurationConfig
          activeDeadlineSecondsOverride: 3600 <1>
----

<1> Specify the global default for run-once pods in seconds.

[[specifying-a-custom-duration-per-project]]
== Specifying a Custom Duration per Project

In addition to specifying a global maximum duration for run-once pods, an
administrator can add an annotation
(`openshift.io/active-deadline-seconds-override`) to a specific project to
override the global default.

====

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Project
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/active-deadline-seconds-override: "1000" <1>
----

<1> Overrides the default active deadline seconds for run-once pods to 1000 seconds.
Note that the value of the override must be specified in string form.
