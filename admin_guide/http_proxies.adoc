== Overview
Production environments can deny direct access to the Internet and instead have
an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. Configuring OpenShift to use these proxies can
be as simple as setting standard environment variables in configuration or JSON
files.

[[configuring-hosts-for-proxies]]

== Configuring Hosts for Proxies

. Add the `*NO_PROXY*`, `*HTTP_PROXY*`, and `*HTTPS_PROXY*` environment variables
to each host's *_/etc/sysconfig/openshift-master_* or
*_/etc/sysconfig/openshift-node_* file depending on the type of host:
+
====
----
HTTP_PROXY=http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@10.0.1.1:8080/
HTTPS_PROXY=https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@10.0.0.1:8080/
NO_PROXY=master.hostname.example.com
----
====

. Restart the master or node as appropriate:
+
----
# systemctl restart openshift-master
# systemctl restart openshift-node
----

[[proxying-docker-pull]]

== Proxying Docker Pull

OpenShift node hosts need to perform push and pull operations to Docker
registries. If you have a registry that does not need a proxy for nodes to
access, include the NO_PROXY parameter with the registry's hostname, the
registry service's IP address, and service name. This blacklists that registry's
address, leaving the external http proxy as the only option.

. Edit the *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* file and add the variables in shell format:
+
====
----
HTTP_PROXY=http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@10.0.1.1:8080/
HTTPS_PROXY=https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@10.0.0.1:8080/
NO_PROXY=master.hostname.example.com,172.30.123.45,docker-registry.default.svc.cluster.local
----
====

. Restart the Docker service:
+
----
# systemctl restart docker
----

////
. If you had already imported ImageStreams before creating the proxy
configuration, delete, then re-run the process:
+
----
# oc delete imagestreams -n openshift --all
# oc create -f image-streams.json -n openshift
----
////

[[s2i-builds]]

== S2I Builds

S2I builds fetch dependencies from various locations. You can
link:../dev_guide/builds.html#environment-files[use a *_.sti/environment_* file]
to specify simple shell variables and OpenShift will react accordingly when
seeing build images.

The following are the supported proxy environment variables with example values:

====
----
HTTP_PROXY=http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@10.0.1.1:8080/
HTTPS_PROXY=https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@10.0.0.1:8080/
NO_PROXY=master.hostname.example.com
----
====

[[configuring-default-templates-for-proxies]]

== Configuring Default Templates for Proxies

The example templates available in OpenShift by default do not include settings
for http proxies. For existing applications based on these templates, modify the
`*source*` section of the buildConfig and add proxy settings:

====
"source": {
  "type": "Git",
  "git": {
    "uri": "https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git",
    "httpProxy"  : "http://proxy.example.com",
    "httpsProxy" : "https://proxy.example.com"
  }
}
====

This is similar to the process for link:#git-repository-access[using proxies for
Git cloning].

[[setting-environment-variables-in-pods]]

== Setting Environment Variables in Pods

Set the following environment variables in a DeploymentConfig to pass database
connection information. The same can be done for configuring a Pod's proxy at
runtime:

====
----
{
  "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
  "kind": "DeploymentConfig",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "frontend"
  },
  "template": {
    "controllerTemplate": {
      "podTemplate": {
        "desiredState": {
          "manifest": {
            "containers": [
              {
                "env": [
                  {
                    "name": "HTTP_PROXY",
                    "value": "http://USER:PASSWORD@IPADDR:PORT"
                  },
----
====

You can also use the `oc env` command to update a DeploymentConfig with a new
environment variable:

----
oc env <object_type>/<object_type_name> <EN_VAR>=/<VALUE>
----

If you have a link:../dev_guide/deployments.html#triggers[ConfigChange trigger]
set up in your OpenShift instance, the changes happen automatically. Otherwise,
manually redeploy your application for the changes to take effect.
