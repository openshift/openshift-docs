== Overview

In {product-title}, you can _back up_ (saving state to separate storage) and
_restore_ (recreating state from separate storage) at the cluster level. There
is also some preliminary support for xref:project-backup[per-project backup].
The full state of a cluster installation includes:

- etcd data on each master
- API objects
- registry storage
- volume storage

This topic does not cover how to back up and restore
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/index.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-index[persistent
storage], as those topics are left to the underlying storage provider. However,
an example of how to perform a *generic* backup of
xref:backup-application-data[application data] is provided.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This topic only provides a generic way of backing up applications and the
{product-title} cluster. It can not take into account custom requirements.
Therefore, you should create a full backup and restore procedure. To prevent
data loss, necessary precautions should be taken.
====

[[backup-restore-prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

. Because the restore procedure involves a xref:cluster-restore[complete
reinstallation], save all the files used in the initial installation. This may
include:
+
- *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* (from the
xref:../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[Quick Installation]
method)
- Ansible playbooks and inventory files (from the
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[Advanced
Installation] method)
- *_/etc/yum.repos.d/ose.repo_* (from the
xref:../install_config/install/disconnected_install.adoc#install-config-install-disconnected-install[Disconnected
Installation] method)

. Backup the procedures for post-installation steps. Some installations may
involve steps that are not included in the installer. This may include changes
to the services outside of the control of {product-title} or the installation of
extra services like monitoring agents.
Additional configuration that is not supported yet by the advanced installer
might also be affected, for example when using multiple authentication providers.

. Install packages that provide various utility commands:
+
----
# yum install etcd
----
. If using a container-based installation, pull the etcd image instead:
+
----
# docker pull rhel7/etcd
----

Note the location of the *etcd* data directory (or `$ETCD_DATA_DIR` in the
following sections), which depends on how *etcd* is deployed.

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
| Deployment Type| Data Directory

|all-in-one cluster
|*_/var/lib/openshift/openshift.local.etcd_*

|external etcd (not on master)
|*_/var/lib/etcd_*

|embedded etcd (on master)
|*_/var/lib/origin/etcd_*
|===


[[cluster-backup]]
== Cluster Backup

. Save all the certificates and keys, on each master:
+
----
# cd /etc/origin/master
# tar cf /tmp/certs-and-keys-$(hostname).tar \
    master.proxy-client.crt \
    master.proxy-client.key \
    proxyca.crt \
    proxyca.key \
    master.server.crt \
    master.server.key \
    ca.crt \
    ca.key \
    master.etcd-client.crt \
    master.etcd-client.key \
    master.etcd-ca.crt
----

. If *etcd* is running on more than one host, stop it on each host:
+
----
# sudo systemctl stop etcd
----
+
Although this step is not strictly necessary, doing so ensures that the *etcd*
data is fully synchronized.

. Create an *etcd* backup:
+
----
# etcdctl backup \
    --data-dir $ETCD_DATA_DIR \
    --backup-dir $ETCD_DATA_DIR.bak
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If *etcd* is running on more than one host,
the various instances regularly synchronize their data,
so creating a backup for one of them is sufficient.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
For a container-based installation, you must use `docker exec` to run *etcdctl*
inside the container.
====

. Create a template for all cluster API objects:
+
====
----
$ oc export all \
    --exact \//<1>
    --all-namespaces \
    --as-template=mycluster \//<2>
    > mycluster.template.yaml
----
<1> Preserve fields that may be cluster specific,
such as service `portalIP` values or generated names.
<2> The output file has `kind: Template` and `metadata.name: mycluster`.
====
+
The object types included in `oc export all` are:

- BuildConfig
- Build
- DeploymentConfig
- ImageStream
- Pod
- ReplicationController
- Route
- Service

[[cluster-restore]]
== Cluster Restore

[NOTE]
====
This restore operation only works for single-member *etcd* clusters. For
multiple-member *etcd* clusters, see 
xref:../install_config/downgrade.adoc#downgrading-restoring-etcd[Restoring *etcd*]. 
====

To restore the cluster:

. Reinstall {product-title}.
+
This should be done in the
xref:../install_config/index.adoc#install-config-index[same way]
that {product-title} was previously installed.

. Run all necessary post-installation steps.
+
. Restore the certificates and keys, on each master:
+
----
# cd /etc/origin/master
# tar xvf /tmp/certs-and-keys-$(hostname).tar
----

. Restore from the *etcd* backup:
+
----
# mv $ETCD_DATA_DIR $ETCD_DATA_DIR.orig
# cp -Rp $ETCD_DATA_DIR.bak $ETCD_DATA_DIR
# chcon -R --reference $ETCD_DATA_DIR.orig $ETCD_DATA_DIR
# chown -R etcd:etcd $ETCD_DATA_DIR
----
. Create the API objects for the cluster:
+
----
$ oc create -f mycluster.template.yaml
----

[[project-backup]]
== Project Backup

A future release of {product-title} will feature specific support for
per-project back up and restore.

For now, to back up API objects at the project level, use `oc export` for each
object to be saved. For example, to save the deployment configuration `frontend`
in YAML format:

----
$ oc export dc frontend -o yaml > dc-frontend.yaml
----

To back up all of the project (with the exception of cluster objects like
namespaces and projects):

----
$ oc export all -o yaml > project.yaml
----

[[backup-rolebindings]]
=== Role Bindings

Sometimes custom policy
xref:../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.adoc#managing-role-bindings[role
bindings] are used in a project. For example, a project administrator can give
another user a certain role in the project and grant that user project access.

These role bindings can be exported:

----
$ oc get rolebindings -o yaml --export=true > rolebindings.yaml
----

[[backup-serviceaccounts]]
=== Service Accounts

If custom service accounts are created in a project, these need to be exported:

----
$ oc get serviceaccount -o yaml --export=true > serviceaccount.yaml
----

[[backup-secrets]]
=== Secrets

Custom secrets like source control management secrets (SSH Public Keys,
Username/Password) should be exported if they are used:

----
$ oc get secret -o yaml --export=true > secret.yaml
----

[[backup-pvc]]
=== Persistent Volume Claims

If the an application within a project uses a persistent volume through a
persistent volume claim (PVC), these should be backed up:

----
$ oc get pvc -o yaml --export=true > pvc.yaml
----


[[project-restore]]
== Project Restore

To restore a project, recreate the project and recreate all all of the objects
that were exported during the backup:

----
$ oc new-project myproject
$ oc create -f project.yaml
$ oc create -f secret.yaml
$ oc create -f serviceaccount.yaml
$ oc create -f pvc.yaml
$ oc create -f rolebindings.yaml
----

[NOTE]
====
Some resources can fail to be created (for example, pods and default service
accounts).
====

[[backup-application-data]]
== Application Data Backup
In many cases, application data can be backed up using the `oc rsync` command,
assuming `rsync` is installed within the container image. The Red Hat *rhel7*
base image does contain `rsync`. Therefore, all images that are based on *rhel7*
contain it as well.

[WARNING]
====
This is a _generic_ backup of application data and does not take into account
application-specific backup procedures, for example special export/import
procedures for database systems.
====

Other means of backup may exist depending on the type of the persistent volume
(for example, Cinder, NFS, Gluster, or others).

The paths to back up are also _application specific_. You can determine
what path to back up by looking at the `*mountPath*` for volumes in the
`*deploymentconfig*`.

.Example of Backing up a Jenkins Deployment's Application Data

. Get the application data `*mountPath*` from the `*deploymentconfig*`:
+
----
$ oc export dc/jenkins|grep mountPath
        - mountPath: /var/lib/jenkins
----

. Get the name of the pod that is currently running:
+
----
$ oc get po --selector=deploymentconfig=jenkins
NAME              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
jenkins-1-a3347   1/1       Running   0          18h
----

. Use the `oc rsync` command to copy application data:
+
----
$ oc rsync jenkins-1-37nux:/var/lib/jenkins /tmp/
----

[NOTE]
====
This type of application data backup can only be performed while an application
pod is currently running.
====


[[restore-application-data]]
== Application Data Restore

The process for restoring application data is similar to the
xref:backup-application-data[application backup procedure] using the `oc rsync`
tool. The same restrictions apply and the process of restoring application data
requires a persistent volume.

.Example of Restoring a Jenkins Deployment's Application Data

. Verify the backup:
+
----
$ ls -la /tmp/jenkins-backup/
total 8
drwxrwxr-x.  3 user     user   20 Sep  6 11:14 .
drwxrwxrwt. 17 root     root 4096 Sep  6 11:16 ..
drwxrwsrwx. 12 user     user 4096 Sep  6 11:14 jenkins
----

. Use the `oc rsync` tool to copy the data into the running pod:
+
----
$ oc rsync /tmp/jenkins-backup/jenkins jenkins-1-37nux:/var/lib
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Depending on the application, you may be required to restart the application.
====

. Restart the application with new data (_optional_):
+
----
$ oc delete po jenkins-1-37nux
----
+
Alternatively, you can scale down the deployment to 0, and then up again:
+
----
$ oc scale --replicas=0 dc/jenkins
$ oc scale --replicas=1 dc/jenkins
----
