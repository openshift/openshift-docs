== Overview

In {product-title}, you can
_back up_, saving state to separate storage,
and _restore_, recreating state from separate storage,
at the cluster level.
There is also some preliminary support for
xref:project-backup[per-project backup].
The full state of a cluster installation includes:

- etcd data on each master
- API objects
- registry storage
- volume storage

This topic does not cover how to back up and restore
link:../install_config/persistent_storage/index.html[persistent storage],
as those topics are left to the underlying storage provider.


[[backup-restore-prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

As the restore procedure involves a
link:#cluster-restore[complete reinstallation],
it is a good idea to save all the files used in the initial installation.
This may include:

- *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* (from the
link:../install_config/install/quick_install.html[Quick Installation]
method)
- ansible playbooks and inventory files (from the
link:../install_config/install/advanced_install.html[Advanced Installation]
method)
- *_/etc/yum.repos.d/ose.repo_* (from the
link:../install_config/install/disconnected_install.html[Disconnected Installation]
method)
//??? Other files?

Install packages that provide various utility commands:

----
# yum install etcd
----


[[cluster-backup]]
== Cluster Backup

. Save all the certificates and keys, on each master:
+
----
# cd /etc/origin/master
# tar cf /tmp/certs-and-keys-$(hostname).tar \
    master.proxy-client.crt \
    master.proxy-client.key \
    proxyca.crt \
    proxyca.key \
    master.server.crt \
    master.server.key \
    ca.crt \
    ca.key \
    master.etcd-client.crt \
    master.etcd-client.key \
    master.etcd-ca.crt
----
//??? What is missing?
//??? What is unnecessary?

. Create an *etcd* backup:
+
----
# etcdctl backup \
    --data-dir /var/lib/origin/etcd \
    --backup-dir /var/lib/origin/etcd.bak
----
+
[NOTE]
====
- If *etcd* is running on more than one host,
  the various instances regularly synchronize their data,
  so creating a backup for one of them is sufficient.
- If *etcd* is running on an independent host (not on a master),
  use *_/var/lib/etcd_* as the `--data-dir` argument,
  and *_/var/lib/etcd.bak_* as the `--backup-dir` argument.
====

. Create a template for all cluster API objects:
+
====
----
$ oc export all \
    --exact \//<1>
    --all-namespaces \
    --as-template=cluster.template
----
<1> Preserve fields that may be cluster specific,
such as service `portalIP` values or generated names.
====
//??? pkg/cmd/cli/cmd/export.go line 76 says:
//    cmd.Flags().Bool("all", true, "DEPRECATED: all is ignored, specifying a resource without a name selects all the instances of that resource")
//    What does "deprecated" mean for the user?  (Can ‘all’ be used, anyway?)


[[cluster-restore]]
== Cluster Restore

//??? (for this section) Is the ordering (API objects, then etcd) correct?

. Reinstall {product-title}.
//??? Is there a better way to "zero out" the cluster?
This should be done in the
link:../install_config/install/index.html[same way]
that {product-title} was previously installed.

. Restore the certificates and keys, on each master:
+
----
# cd /etc/origin/master
# tar xvf /tmp/certs-and-keys-$(hostname).tar
----

. Create the API objects for the cluster:
+
----
$ oc process -f cluster.template
----
//??? Other flags?

. Restore from the *etcd* backup on each master:
+
----
# etcdctl restore \
    --backup-dir /var/lib/origin/etcd.bak \
    --data-dir /var/lib/origin/etcd
----
//??? This is a guess based on <https://lwn.net/Articles/631630/> (!).
//    What am i missing?


// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//??? Does the cluster need to be "quiescent" for backup/restore/both?
//??? Generally, what are the required conditions for a successful backup/restore?
//??? Are there other considerations for special configurations?
//??? (meta) Is this documentation on the right track?


[[project-backup]]
== Project Backup

A future release of {product-title} will feature specific
support for per-project backup and restore.

For now, to back up API objects at the project level,
use `oc export` for each object to be saved.
For example, to save the deployment configuration `frontend` in YAML format:

----
$ oc export dc frontend -o yaml > dc-frontend.yaml
----

//??? Scare quotes in next sentence because annotations are not included.
//    For this reason, i don't want to include it...
//
// To back up "all" of the project:
//
// ----
// $ oc export all -o yaml > project.yaml
// ----
