== Overview

In {product-title}, you can _back up_ (saving state to separate storage) and
_restore_ (recreating state from separate storage) at the cluster level. There
is also some preliminary support for xref:project-backup[per-project backup].
The full state of a cluster installation includes:

- etcd data on each master
- API objects
- registry storage
- volume storage

This topic does not cover how to back up and restore
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/index.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-index[persistent
storage], as those topics are left to the underlying storage provider.


[[backup-restore-prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

. Because the restore procedure involves a xref:cluster-restore[complete
reinstallation], save all the files used in the initial installation. This may
include:
+
- *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* (from the
xref:../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[Quick Installation]
method)
- Ansible playbooks and inventory files (from the
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[Advanced
Installation] method)
- *_/etc/yum.repos.d/ose.repo_* (from the
xref:../install_config/install/disconnected_install.adoc#install-config-install-disconnected-install[Disconnected
Installation] method)

. Install packages that provide various utility commands:
+
----
# yum install etcd
----

Note the location of the *etcd* data directory (or `$ETCD_DATA_DIR` in the
following sections), which depends on how *etcd* is deployed.

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
| Deployment Type| Data Directory

|all-in-one cluster
|*_/var/lib/openshift/openshift.local.etcd_*

|external etcd (not on master)
|*_/var/lib/etcd_*

|embedded etcd (on master)
|*_/var/lib/origin/etcd_*
|===


[[cluster-backup]]
== Cluster Backup

. Save all the certificates and keys, on each master:
+
----
# cd /etc/origin/master
# tar cf /tmp/certs-and-keys-$(hostname).tar \
    master.proxy-client.crt \
    master.proxy-client.key \
    proxyca.crt \
    proxyca.key \
    master.server.crt \
    master.server.key \
    ca.crt \
    ca.key \
    master.etcd-client.crt \
    master.etcd-client.key \
    master.etcd-ca.crt
----

. If *etcd* is running on more than one host, stop it on each host:
+
----
# sudo systemctl stop etcd
----
+
Although this step is not strictly necessary, doing so ensures that the *etcd*
data is fully synchronized.

. Create an *etcd* backup:
+
----
# etcdctl backup \
    --data-dir $ETCD_DATA_DIR \
    --backup-dir $ETCD_DATA_DIR.bak
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If *etcd* is running on more than one host,
the various instances regularly synchronize their data,
so creating a backup for one of them is sufficient.
====

. Create a template for all cluster API objects:
+
====
----
$ oc export all \
    --exact \//<1>
    --all-namespaces \
    --as-template=mycluster \//<2>
    > mycluster.template.yaml
----
<1> Preserve fields that may be cluster specific,
such as service `portalIP` values or generated names.
<2> The output file has `kind: Template` and `metadata.name: mycluster`.
====
+
The object types included in `oc export all` are:

- BuildConfig
- Build
- DeploymentConfig
- ImageStream
- Pod
- ReplicationController
- Route
- Service

[[cluster-restore]]
== Cluster Restore

. Reinstall {product-title}.
+
This should be done in the
xref:../install_config/index.adoc#install-config-index[same way]
that {product-title} was previously installed.

. Restore the certificates and keys, on each master:
+
----
# cd /etc/origin/master
# tar xvf /tmp/certs-and-keys-$(hostname).tar
----

. Restore from the *etcd* backup:
+
----
# mv $ETCD_DATA_DIR $ETCD_DATA_DIR.orig
# cp -Rp $ETCD_DATA_DIR.bak $ETCD_DATA_DIR
# chcon -R --reference $ETCD_DATA_DIR.orig $ETCD_DATA_DIR
# chown -R etcd:etcd $ETCD_DATA_DIR
----

. Create the API objects for the cluster:
+
----
$ oc create -f mycluster.template.yaml
----

[[project-backup]]
== Project Backup

A future release of {product-title} will feature specific support for
per-project back up and restore.

For now, to back up API objects at the project level, use `oc export` for each
object to be saved. For example, to save the deployment configuration `frontend`
in YAML format:

----
$ oc export dc frontend -o yaml > dc-frontend.yaml
----

To back up all of the project (with the exception of cluster objects like
namespaces and projects):

----
$ oc export all -o yaml > project.yaml
----
