== Overview
As described in the
xref:../architecture/networking/sdn.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-sdn[SDN documentation]
there are multiple layers of interfaces that are created to correctly
pass the traffic from one container to another.  In order to debug
connectivity issues, you have to test the different layers of the
stack to work out where the problem arises.  This guide will help you
dig down through the layers to identify the problem and how to fix it.

Part of the problem is that {product-title} can be set up many ways, and the
networking can be wrong in a few different places.  So this document
will work through some scenarios that, hopefully, will cover the
majority of cases.  If your problem is not covered, the tools and
concepts that are introduced should help guide debugging efforts.

== Nomenclature

Cluster:: The set of machines in the cluster.  _i.e._ the Masters
and the Nodes.
Master:: A controller of the {product-title} cluster.  Note that the
master may not be a node in the cluster, and thus, may not have IP
connectivity to the pods.
Node:: Host in the cluster running {product-title} that can host pods.
Pod:: Group of containers running on a node, managed by {product-title}.
Service:: Abstraction that presents a unified network interface that
is backed by one or more pods.
Router:: A web proxy that can map various URLs and paths into
{product-title} services to allow external traffic to travel into the
cluster.
Node Address:: The IP address of a node.  This is assigned and managed
by the owner of the network to which the node is attached.  Must be
reachable from any node in the cluster (master and client).
Pod Address:: The IP address of a pod.  These are assigned and managed
by {product-title}.  By default they are assigned out of the 10.128.0.0/14
network (or, in older versions, 10.1.0.0/16).  Only reachable from the
client nodes.
Service Address:: An IP address that represents the service, and is
mapped to a pod address internally.  These are assigned and managed by
{product-title}.  By default they are assigned out of the 172.30.0.0/16
network.  Only reachable from the client nodes.

The following diagram shows all of the pieces involved with external access.

== Debugging External Access to an HTTP Service

If you are on an machine outside the cluster and are trying to access
a resource provided by the cluster there needs to be a process running
in a pod that listens on a public IP address and "routes" that traffic
inside the cluster.  The
xref:../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-routes[{product-title} router]
serves that purpose for HTTP, HTTPS (with SNI), WebSockets, or TLS
(with SNI).

Assuming you can't access an HTTP service from the outside of the
cluster, let's start by reproducing the problem on the command line of
the machine where things are failing.  Try:
....
curl -kv http://foo.example.com:8000/bar    # But replace the argument with your URL
....

If that works, are you reproducing the bug from the right place?  It
is also possible that the service has some pods that work, and some
that don't.  So jump ahead to the <<debugging-the-router>> section.


If that failed, then let's resolve the DNS name to an IP address (assuming it isn't already one):
....
dig +short foo.example.com                  # But replace the hostname with yours
....

If that doesn't give back an IP address, it's time to troubleshoot
DNS, but that's outside the scope of this guide.

IMPORTANT: Make sure that the IP address that you got back is one that you expect to be running
the router.  If it's not, fix your DNS.

Next, use `ping -c _address_` and `tracepath _address_` to check that
you can reach the router host.  It is possible that they will not
respond to ICMP packets, in which case those tests will fail, but the
router machine may be reachable.  In which case, try using the telnet
command to access the port for the router directly:
....
telnet 1.2.3.4 8000
....

You may get:
....
Trying 1.2.3.4...
Connected to 1.2.3.4.
Escape character is '^]'.
....

If so, there's something listening on the port on the IP address.
That's good.  Hit `ctrl-]` then hit the _enter_ key and then type
`close` to quit telnet.  Move on to the <<debugging-the-router>>
section to check other things on the router.

Or you could get:
....
Trying 1.2.3.4...
telnet: connect to address 1.2.3.4: Connection refused
....

Which tells us that the router is not listening on that port.  See the 
<<debugging-the-router>> section for more pointers on how to
configure the router.


Or if you see:
[source,sh]
....
Trying 1.2.3.4...
  telnet: connect to address 1.2.3.4: Connection timed out
....

Which tells us that you can't talk to anything on that IP address.
Check your routing, firewalls, and that you have a router listening on
that IP address.  To debug the router, see the
<<debugging-the-router>> section. For IP routing and firewall issues,
debugging that is beyond the purview of this guide.

[[debugging-the-router]]
== Debugging the Router

Now that you have an IP address, we need to `ssh` to that machine and
check that the router software is running on that machine and
configured correctly.  So let's `ssh` there and get administrative
{product-title} credentials.

include::dev_guide/authentication.adoc[tag=systemadminlogin]

Check that the router is running:
....
# oc get endpoints --namespace=default --selector=router
NAMESPACE   NAME              ENDPOINTS
default     router            10.128.0.4:80
....

If that command fails, then your {product-title} configuration is broken.
Fixing that is outside the scope of this document.

You should see one or more router endpoints listed, but that won't
tell you if they are running on the machine with the given external IP
address, since the endpoint IP address will be one of the pod
addresses that is internal to the cluster.  To get the list of router
host IP addresses, run:
....
# oc get pods --all-namespaces --selector=router --template='{{range .items}}HostIP: {{.status.hostIP}} PodIP: {{.status.podIP}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'
HostIP: 192.168.122.202   PodIP: 10.128.0.4
....

You should see the host IP that corresponds to your external address.
If you do not, refer to the
xref:../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-routes[router documentation] to
configure the router pod to run on the right node (by setting the
affinity correctly) or update your DNS to match the IP addresses where
the routers are running.

At this point in the guide, you should be on a node, running your
router pod, but you still cannot get the HTTP request to work.  First
we need to make sure that the router is mapping the external URL to
the correct service, and if that works, we need to dig into that
service to make sure that all endpoints are reachable.

Let's list all of the routes that {product-title} knows about:
....
# oc get route --all-namespaces
NAME              HOST/PORT         PATH      SERVICE        LABELS    TLS TERMINATION
route-unsecured   www.example.com   /test     service-name
....

If the host name and path from your URL don't match anything in the
list of returned routes, then you need to add a route.  See the
xref:../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-routes[router documentation].

If your route is present, then you need to debug access to the
endpoints.  That's the same as if you were debugging problems with a
service, so continue on with the next <<debugging-a-service>>
section.

[[debugging-a-service]]
== Debugging a Service

If you can't communicate with a service from inside the cluster
(either because your services can't communicate directly, or because
you are using the router and everything works until you get into the
cluster) then you need to work out what endpoints are associated with
a service and debug them.

First, let's get the services:
....
# oc get services --all-namespaces
NAMESPACE   NAME              LABELS                                    SELECTOR                  IP(S)            PORT(S)
default     docker-registry   docker-registry=default                   docker-registry=default   172.30.243.225   5000/TCP
default     kubernetes        component=apiserver,provider=kubernetes   <none>                    172.30.0.1       443/TCP
default     router            router=router                             router=router             172.30.213.8     80/TCP
....

You should see your service in the list.  If not, then you need to
define your
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-pods-and-services[service].

The IP addresses listed in the service output are the Kubernetes
service IP addresses that Kubernetes will map to one of the pods that
backs that service.  So you should be able to talk to that IP address.
But, unfortunately, even if you can, it doesn't mean all pods are reachable;
and if you can't, it doesn't mean all pods aren't reachable.  It just
tells you the status of the _one_ that kubeproxy hooked you up to.

Let's test the service anyway.  From one of your nodes:
....
curl -kv http://172.30.243.225:5000/bar                  # Replace the argument with your service IP address and port
....
Then, let's work out what pods are backing our service (replace `docker-registry` with the name of the broken service):
....
# oc get endpoints --selector=docker-registry
NAME              ENDPOINTS
docker-registry   10.128.2.2:5000
....

From this, we can see that there's only one endpoint.  So, if your
service test succeeded, and the router test succeeded, then something
really odd is going on.  But if there's more than one endpoint, or the
service test failed, try the following _for each_ endpoint.  Once you
identify what endpoints aren't working, then proceed to the next
section.

First, test each endpoint (change the URL to have the right endpoint IP, port, and path):
....
curl -kv http://10.128.2.2:5000/bar
....

If that works, great, try the next one.  If it failed, make a note of
it and we'll work out why, in the next section.

If all of them failed, then it is possible that the local node is not
working, jump to the <<debugging-local-networking>> section.

If all of them worked, then jump to the <<debugging-kubernetes>>
section to work out why the service IP address isn't working.


[[debugging-node-to-node-networking]]
== Debugging Node to Node Networking

Using our list of non-working endpoints, we need to test connectivity
to the node.

. Make sure that all nodes have the expected IP addresses:
+
====
[source,terminal]
----
# oc get hostsubnet
NAME                   HOST                   HOST IP           SUBNET
rh71-os1.example.com   rh71-os1.example.com   192.168.122.46    10.1.1.0/24
rh71-os2.example.com   rh71-os2.example.com   192.168.122.18    10.1.2.0/24
rh71-os3.example.com   rh71-os3.example.com   192.168.122.202   10.1.0.0/24
----
====
+
If you are using DHCP they could have changed. Ensure the host names, IP
addresses, and subnets match what you expect. If any node details have changed,
use `oc edit hostsubnet` to correct the entries.

. After ensuring the node addresses and host names are correct, list the
endpoint IPs and node IPs:
+
====
[source,terminal]
----
# oc get pods --selector=docker-registry \
    --template='{{range .items}}HostIP: {{.status.hostIP}}   PodIP: {{.status.podIP}}{{end}}{{"\n"}}'

HostIP: 192.168.122.202   PodIP: 10.128.0.4
----
====

. Find the endpoint IP address you made note of before and look for it in the
`PodIP` entry, and find the corresponding `HostIP` address. Then test
connectivity at the node host level using the address from `HostIP`:

* `ping -c 3 <IP_address>`: No response could mean that an intermediate router is eating the ICMP traffic.

* `tracepath <IP_address>`: Shows the IP route taken to the target, if ICMP packets are returned by all hops.
+
If both `tracepath` and `ping` fail, then look for connectivity issues with your
local or virtual network.

. For local networking, check the following:
+
* Check the route the packet takes out of the box to the target address:
+
====
[source,terminal]
----
# ip route get 192.168.122.202
  192.168.122.202 dev ens3  src 192.168.122.46
    cache
----
====
+
In the above example, it will go out the interface named `ens3` with the
source address of `192.168.122.46` and go directly to the target. If that is what you expected, use `ip a show dev ens3` to get the interface details and
make sure that is the expected interface.
+
An alternate result may be the following:
+
====
[source,terminal]
----
# ip route get 192.168.122.202
  1.2.3.4 via 192.168.122.1 dev ens3  src 192.168.122.46
----
====
+
It will pass through the `via` IP value to route appropriately. Ensure that the
traffic is routing correctly. Debugging route traffic is beyond the scope of
this guide.

Other debugging options for node to node networking can be solved with the following:

* Do you have ethernet link on both ends? Look for `Link detected: yes` in the output from `ethtool <network_interface>`.
* Are your duplex settings, and ethernet speeds right on both ends? Look through the rest of the `ethtool <network_interface>` information.
* Are the cables plugged in correctly? To the correct ports?
* Are the switches configured correctly?

Once you have ascertained that the node to node connectivity is fine,
we need to look at the SDN configuration on both ends.

[[debugging-local-networking]]
== Debugging Local Networking

At this point we should have a list of one or more endpoints that you
can't communicate with, but that have node to node connectivity.  For
each one, we need to work out what is wrong, but first you need to
understand how the SDN sets up the networking on a node for the
different pods.

=== The Interfaces on a Node

These are the interfaces that the OpenShift SDN creates:

* `br0`: The OVS bridge device that containers will be attached to.
OpenShift SDN also configures a set of non-subnet-specific flow rules
on this bridge.
* `tun0`: An OVS internal port (port 2 on `br0`). This gets assigned the
cluster subnet gateway address, and is used for external network
access. OpenShift SDN configures `netfilter` and routing rules to enable access
from the cluster subnet to the external network via NAT.
* `vxlan_sys_4789`: The OVS VXLAN device (port 1 on `br0`), which provides access to containers on remote nodes. Referred to as `vxlan0` in the OVS rules.
* `vethX` (in the main netns): A Linux virtual ethernet peer of `eth0` in the Docker netns. It will be attached to the OVS bridge on one of the other ports.


=== SDN Flows Inside a Node

image:SDN.png[The possible SDN paths]

Depending on what you are trying to access (or be accessed from) the
path will vary.  There are four different places the SDN connects
(inside a node).  They are labeled in red on the diagram above.

* *Pod:* Traffic is going from one pod to another on the same machine (1 to a different 1)
* *Remote Node (or Pod):* Traffic is going from a local pod to a remote node or pod in the same cluster (1 to 2)
* *External Machine:* Traffic is going from a local pod outside the cluster (1 to 3)

Of course the opposite traffic flows are also possible.

=== Debugging Steps

==== Is IP Forwarding Enabled?

Check that `sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward` is set to 1 (and check the host if this is a VM)

====  Are your routes correct?

Check the route tables with `ip route`:
....
# ip route
default via 192.168.122.1 dev ens3
10.128.0.0/14 dev tun0  proto kernel  scope link                        # This sends all pod traffic into OVS
10.128.2.0/23 dev tun0  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.128.2.1        # This is traffic going to local pods, overriding the above
169.254.0.0/16 dev ens3  scope link  metric 1002                        # This is for Zeroconf (may not be present)
172.17.0.0/16 dev docker0  proto kernel  scope link  src 172.17.42.1    # Docker's private IPs... used only by things directly configured by docker; not OpenShift
192.168.122.0/24 dev ens3  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.122.46 # The physical interface on the local subnet
....

You should see the 10.128.x.x lines (assuming you have your pod network set to the default range in your configuration). If you do not, check the {product-title} logs (see the <<reading-the-logs>> section)

=== Is the Open vSwitch (OVS) configured correctly?

You must run the `ovs-vsctl` and `ovs-ofctl` commands on one of the OVS pods.

To list the OVS pods, enter the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod -n openshift-sdn -l app=ovs
----

Check the Open vSwitch bridges on both sides.
Replace `<ovs_pod_name>` with the name of one of the OVS pods.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -n openshift-sdn <ovs_pod_name> -- ovs-vsctl list-br
br0
----

The previous command should return `br0`.

You can list all of the ports that OVS knows about:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -n openshift-sdn <ovs_pod_name> -- ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 dump-ports-desc br0
OFPST_PORT_DESC reply (OF1.3) (xid=0x2):
 1(vxlan0): addr:9e:f1:7d:4d:19:4f
     config:     0
     state:      0
     speed: 0 Mbps now, 0 Mbps max
 2(tun0): addr:6a:ef:90:24:a3:11
     config:     0
     state:      0
     speed: 0 Mbps now, 0 Mbps max
 8(vethe19c6ea): addr:1e:79:f3:a0:e8:8c
     config:     0
     state:      0
     current:    10GB-FD COPPER
     speed: 10000 Mbps now, 0 Mbps max
 LOCAL(br0): addr:0a:7f:b4:33:c2:43
     config:     PORT_DOWN
     state:      LINK_DOWN
     speed: 0 Mbps now, 0 Mbps max
----

In particular, the `vethX` devices for all of the active pods should
be listed as ports.

Next, list the flows that are configured on that bridge:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -n openshift-sdn <ovs_pod_name> --  ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 dump-flows br0
----

The results will vary slightly depending on whether you are using the
*ovs-subnet* or *ovs-multitenant* plug-in, but there are certain general things
you can look for:

. Every remote node should have a flow matching `tun_src=<node_IP_address>` (for
incoming VXLAN traffic from that node) and another flow including the action
`set_field:<node_IP_address>\->tun_dst` (for outgoing VXLAN traffic to that
node).

. Every local pod should have flows matching `arp_spa=<pod_IP_address>` and
`arp_tpa=<pod_IP_address>` (for incoming and outgoing ARP traffic for that pod),
and flows matching `nw_src=<pod_IP_address>` and `nw_dst=<pod_IP_address>` (for
incoming and outgoing IP traffic for that pod).

If there are flows missing, look in the <<reading-the-logs>>
section.

==== Is the `iptables` configuration correct?

Check the output from `iptables-save` to make sure you are not
filtering traffic.  However, {product-title} sets up iptables rules during
normal operation, so do not be surprised to see entries there.


==== Is your external network correct?

Check external firewalls, if any, allow traffic to the target address (this is site-dependent, and beyond the purview of this guide).

[[debugging-virtual-networking]]
== Debugging Virtual Networking

[[builds-on-a-virtual-network-are-failing]]
=== Builds on a Virtual Network are Failing

If you are installing {product-title} using a virtual network (for example,
OpenStack), and a build is failing, the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the
target node host might not be compatible with the MTU of the primary network
interface (for example, `eth0`).

For a build to complete successfully, the MTU of an SDN must be less than the
eth0 network MTU in order to pass data to between node hosts.

. Check the MTU of your network by running the `ip addr` command:
+
====
[source,terminal]
----
# ip addr
---
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP qlen 1000
    link/ether fa:16:3e:56:4c:11 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.16.0.0/24 brd 172.16.0.0 scope global dynamic eth0
       valid_lft 168sec preferred_lft 168sec
    inet6 fe80::f816:3eff:fe56:4c11/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
---
----
====
+
The MTU of the above network is 1500.

. The MTU in your node configuration must be lower than the network value. Check
the `*mtu*` in the node configuration of the targeted node host:
+
====
[source,terminal]
----
# $ oc describe configmaps node-config-infra
...
networkConfig:
   mtu: 1450
   networkPluginName: company/openshift-ovs-subnet
...
----
====
+
In the above node configuration file, the `*mtu*` value is lower than the
network MTU, so no configuration is needed. If the `*mtu*` value was higher,
edit the file and lower the value to at least 50 units fewer than the MTU of the
primary network interface, then restart the node service. This would allow
larger packets of data to pass between nodes.
+
[NOTE]
====
To modify a node in your cluster, update the xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#modifying-nodes[node configuration maps] as needed. 
Do not manually edit the `node-config.yaml` file.
====

== Debugging Pod Egress

If you are trying to access an external service from a pod, e.g.:
....
curl -kv github.com
....

Make sure that the DNS is resolving correctly:
....
dig +search +noall +answer github.com
....

That should return the IP address for the github server, but check
that you got back the correct address.  If you get back no address, or
the address of one of your machines, then you may be matching the
wildcard entry in your local DNS server.

To fix that, you either need to make sure that DNS server that has the
wildcard entry is not listed as a `nameserver` in your
`/etc/resolv.conf` _or_ you need to make sure that the wildcard domain
is not listed in the `search` list.

If the correct IP address was returned, then try the debugging advice
listed above in <<debugging-local-networking>>.  Your traffic should
leave the Open vSwitch on port 2 to pass through the `iptables` rules, then
out the route table normally.

[[reading-the-logs]]
== Reading the Logs
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Run: `journalctl -u origin-node.service --boot | less`
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Run: `journalctl -u atomic-openshift-node.service --boot | less`
endif::[]

Look for the `Output of setup script:` line.  Everything starting with
'+' below that are the script steps.  Look through that for obvious
errors.

Following the script you should see lines with `Output of adding
table=0`.  Those are the OVS rules, and there should be no errors.

[[debugging-kubernetes]]
== Debugging Kubernetes

Check `iptables -t nat -L` to make sure that the service is being
NAT'd to the right port on the local machine for the `kubeproxy`.

WARNING: This is all changing soon... Kubeproxy is being eliminated and
replaced with an `iptables`-only solution.

[[sdn-troubleshooting-diagnostics-tool]]
== Finding Network Issues Using the Diagnostics Tool

As a cluster administrator, run the diagnostics tool to diagnose common network
issues:

[source,terminal]
----
# oc adm diagnostics NetworkCheck
----

The diagnostics tool runs a series of checks for error conditions for the
specified component. See the
xref:../admin_guide/diagnostics_tool.adoc#admin-guide-diagnostics-tool[Diagnostics Tool section] for
more information.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, the diagnostics tool cannot diagnose IP failover issues. As a
workaround, you can run the script at
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/openshift-sdn/master/hack/ipf-debug.sh
on the master (or from another machine with access to the master) to generate
useful debugging information. However, this script is unsupported.
====

By default, `oc adm diagnostics NetworkCheck` logs errors into *_/tmp/openshift/_*. This can be configured with the `--network-logdir` option:

[source,terminal]
----
# oc adm diagnostics NetworkCheck --network-logdir=<path/to/directory>
----

== Miscellaneous Notes

=== Other clarifications on ingress
* Kube - declare a service as NodePort and it will claim that port on all machines in the cluster (on what interface?) and then route into kube-proxy and then to a backing pod.  See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport (some node must be accessible from outside)
* Kube - declare as a LoadBalancer and something _you_ have to write does the rest
* OS/AE - Both use the router

[[tls-handshake-timeout]]
=== TLS Handshake Timeout

When a pod fails to deploy, check its docker log for a TLS handshake timeout:

[source,terminal]
----
$ docker log <container_id>
...
[...] couldn't get deployment [...] TLS handshake timeout
...
----

This condition, and generally, errors in establishing a secure connection,
may be caused by a large difference in the MTU values between tun0
and the primary interface (e.g., eth0),
such as when tun0 MTU is 1500 and eth0 MTU is 9000 (jumbo frames).

=== Other debugging notes
* Peer interfaces (of a Linux virtual ethernet pair) can be determined with `ethtool -S _ifname_`
* Driver type: `ethtool -i _ifname_`
