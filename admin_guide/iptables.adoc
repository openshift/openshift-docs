== Overview
There are many system components including {product-title}, containers, and
software that manage local firewall policies that rely on the kernel iptables
configuration for proper network operation. In addition, the iptables
configuration of all nodes in the cluster must be correct for networking to
work.

All components independently work with iptables without knowledge of how other
components are using them. This makes it very easy for one component to break
another component's configuration. Further, {product-title} and the Docker service
assume that iptables remains set up exactly as they have set it up. They may not
detect changes introduced by other components and if they do there may be some
lag in implementing the fix. In particular, {product-title} does monitor and fix
problems. However, the Docker service does not.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that any changes you make to the iptables configuration on a node do not
impact the operation of {product-title} and the Docker service. Also, changes
will often need to be made on all nodes in the cluster. Use caution, as iptables
is not designed to have multiple concurrent users, and is very easy to break
{product-title} and Docker networking.

{product-title} provides several chains, one of which is specifically intended
for administrators to use for their own purposes:
`OPENSHIFT-ADMIN-OUTPUT-RULES`.

====

The chains, order of the chains, and rules in the kernel iptables must be
properly set up on each node in the cluster for {product-title} and Docker
networking to work properly. There are several tools and services that are
commonly used in the system that interact with the kernel iptables and can
accidentally impact {product-title} and the Docker service.

[[iptables-tool]]
== iptables

The iptables tool can be used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IPv4
packet filter rules in the Linux kernel.

Independent of other use, such as a firewall, {product-title} and the Docker
service manage chains in some of the tables. The chains are inserted in specific
order and the rules are specific to their needs.

[CAUTION]
====
`iptables --flush [chain]` can remove key required configuration. Do not
 execute this command.
====

[[iptables-service]]
== iptables.service

The iptables service supports a local network firewall. It assumes total control
of the iptables configuration. When it starts, it flushes and restores the
complete iptables configuration. The restored rules are from its configuration
file, *_/etc/sysconfig/iptables_*. The configuration file is not kept up to date
during operation, so the dynamically added rules are lost during every restart.

[WARNING]
====
Stopping and starting *iptables.service* will destroy configuration that is
required by {product-title} and Docker. {product-title} and Docker are not
notified of the change.
====

----
# systemctl disable iptables.service
# systemctl mask iptables.service
----

If you need to run *iptables.service*, keep a limited configuration in the
configuration file and rely on {product-title} and Docker to install their
needed rules.

The *iptables.service* configuration is loaded from:

----
/etc/sysconfig/iptables
----

To make permanent rules changes, edit the changes into this file. Do not include
Docker or {product-title} rules.

After *iptables.service* is started or restarted on a node, the Docker service
and *atomic-openshift-node.service* must be restarted to reconstruct the needed
iptables configuration.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Restarting the Docker service will cause all containers running on the node to
be stopped and restarted.
====

----
# systemctl restart iptables.service
# systemctl restart docker
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node.service
----
