== Overview
This topic describes how administrators should work with iptables. openshift-sdn takes care of adding the
necessary iptables rules to make it work. Kubernetes and Docker also manage iptables for port forwarding
and services.


== Restarting
Docker doesn't monitor the iptables rules that it adds for exposing ports from containers and hence if
iptables service is restarted, then these rules are lost. So, to safely restart iptables, it is
recommended that the rules are saved and restored.

$ iptables-save > /path/to/iptables.bkp
$ systemctl restart iptables
$ iptables-restore < /path/to/iptables.bkp
