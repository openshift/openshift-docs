== Overview
There are many system components including {product-title}, Docker, and software that manages local
firewall policies that rely on the kernel iptables configuration for proper network operation. In
addition the iptables configuration of all nodes in the cluster must be correct for networking to work.

All components independently work with iptables without knowledge of how other components
are using them. This makes it very easy for one component to break another component's configuration.
Further, {product-title} and Docker assume that iptables remains set up exactly as they have set it up.
They may not detect changes introduced by other components and if they do there maybe some lag in
implementing the fix. In particular, {product-title} does monitor and fix problems, however, Docker does not.

IMPORTANT: You must make sure that whatever changes you make to the iptables configuration on a node
do not impact the operation of {product-title} and Docker. Also, changes will often need to be made on
all nodes in the cluster. Be careful, iptables is not designed to have multiple concurrent users and it
is very easy to break {product-title} and Docker networking.

The chains, order of the chains and rules in the kernel iptables must be properly set up on each node
in the cluster for {product-title} and Docker networking to work properly. There are several tools and
services that are commonly used in the system that interact with the kernel iptables and can
accidentally impact {product-title} and Docker.

=== iptables
`iptables` is a low level tool that can be used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IPv4
packet filter rules in the Linux kernel.

Independent of other use, such as a firewall, {product-title} and Docker manage chains in some of the tables.
The chains are inserted in specific order and the rules are specific to their needs.

IMPORTANT: `iptables --flush [chain]` can remove key required configuration. Don't execute this command.

=== iptables.service
The iptables service supports a local network firewall. It assumes total control of the iptables
configuration and when it starts it flushes and restores the complete iptables configuration.
The restored rules are from its configuration file (/etc/sysconfig/iptables).
The config file is not kept up to date during operation so every restart the dynamically added rules are lost.

WARNING: Stopping and starting the iptables.service will destroy configuration that is required by
{product-title} and Docker. {product-title} and Docker are not notified of the change.

----
# systemctl disable iptables.service
# systemctl mask iptables.service
----

If you need to run iptables.service, keep a limited configuration in the config file and
rely on Docker and openshift to install their needed rules.

The iptables.service configuration is loaded from:

----
/etc/sysconfig/iptables
----

To make permanent rules changes edit the changes into this file. Do not include Docker or {product-title} rules.

After iptables.service is started or restarted on a node, Docker and atomic-openshift-node.service
must be restarted to reconstruct the needed iptables configuration.

IMPORTANT: Restarting Docker will cause all containers running on the node to be stopped and restarted.

----
# systemctl restart iptables.service
# systemctl restart docker
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node.service
