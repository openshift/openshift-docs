== Overview
The OpenShift
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#master[master]
includes a built-in
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.html#oauth[OAuth
server]. Developers and administrators obtain
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.html#api-authentication[OAuth
access tokens] to authenticate themselves to the API.

As an administrator, you can configure OAuth using a
link:master_node_configuration.html[master configuration file] to specify an
link:#identity-providers[identity provider]. When running a master without a
configuration file, the
link:#AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider[`*AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider*`]
identity provider is used by default, which allows any non-empty user name and
password to log in. This is useful for testing purposes.

To use other link:#identity-providers[identity providers], or to modify any
link:#token-options[token], link:#grant-options[grant], or
link:#session-options[session options], you must run the master from a
configuration file.

[[identity-providers]]

== Identity Providers
You can configure the master for authentication using your desired identity
provider by modifying the link:master_node_configuration.html[master
configuration file]. The following sections detail the identity providers
supported by OpenShift.

There are three parameters common to all identity providers:
[cols="2a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter     | Description
.^|`name`      | The provider name is prefixed to provider usernames to form an identity name.
.^|`challenge` | When `true`, unauthenticated token requests from non-web clients (like
the CLI) are sent a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge header. Not supported by all
identity providers.

To prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks against browser clients
Basic authentication challenges are only sent if a `X-CSRF-Token` header is
present on the request. Clients that expect to receive Basic `WWW-Authenticate`
challenges should set this header to a non-empty value.

.^|`login`     | When `true`, unauthenticated token requests from web clients (like the web
console) are redirected to a login page backed by this provider. Not supported
by all identity providers.
|===

[[AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider]]

=== Allow All
Set `*AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider*` in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to
allow any non-empty user name and password to log in. This is the default
identity provider when running OpenShift without a
link:master_node_configuration.html[master configuration file].

console) are redirected to a login page backed by this provider.
====

[[DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider]]

=== Deny All
Set `*DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider*` in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to deny
access for all user name and passwords.

====

[[HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider]]

=== HTPasswd

Set `*HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider*` in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to
validate user names and passwords against a flat file generated using
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html[`htpasswd`].

Only MD5 and SHA encryption types are supported. MD5 encryption is recommended,
and is the default for `htpasswd`. Plaintext, crypt, and bcrypt hashes are not
currently supported.

The flat file is re-read if its modification time changes, without requiring a
server restart.

To create the file, run:

****
`$ htpasswd -c _</path/to/users.htpasswd>_ _<user_name>_`
****

To add or update a login to the file, run:

****
`$ htpasswd _</path/to/users.htpasswd>_ _<user_name>_`
****

To remove a login from the file, run:

****
`$ htpasswd _</path/to/users.htpasswd>_ -D _<user_name>_`
****

console) are redirected to a login page backed by this provider.
<4> File generated using
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html[`htpasswd`].
====

[[LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider]]

=== LDAP Authentication

Set `*LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider*` in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to
validate user names and passwords against an LDAP v3 server, using simple
bind authentication.

During authentication, the LDAP directory is searched for an entry that matches the provided username.
If a single unique match is found, a simple bind is attempted using the distinguished name (DN) of the entry
plus the provided password. Here are the steps taken:

1. Generate a search filter by combining the attribute and filter in the configured `url` with the user-provided username
2. Search the directory using the generated filter. If the search does not return exactly one entry, deny access
3. Attempt to bind to the LDAP server using the DN of the entry retrieved from the search, and the user-provided password.
4. If the bind is unsuccessful, deny access.
5. If the bind is successful, build an Identity using the configured attributes as the identity, email address, display name, and preferred username.

The configured `url` is an RFC 2255 URL, which specifies the LDAP host and search parameters to use. The syntax of the URL is `ldap://host:port/basedn?attribute?scope?filter`

[cols="2a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|URL Component | Description
.^|`ldap`      | For regular ldap, use the string `ldap`. For secure LDAP, use `ldaps` instead.
.^|`host:port` | The name/port of the ldap server (defaults to `localhost:389` for ldap, and `localhost:636` for ldaps).
.^|`basedn`    | The DN of the branch of the directory where all searches should start from. At the very least, this must be the top of your directory tree, but could also specify a subtree in the directory.
.^|`attribute` | The attribute to search for. Although RFC 2255 allows a comma-separated list of attributes, only the first attribute will be used, no matter how many are provided. If no attributes are provided, the default is to use `uid`. It's a good idea to choose an attribute that will be unique across all entries in the subtree you will be using.
.^|`scope`     | The scope of the search. Can be either either `one` or `sub`. If the scope is not provided, the default is to use a scope of `sub`.
.^|`filter`    | A valid LDAP search filter. If not provided, defaults to `(objectClass=*)`
|===

When doing searches, the attribute, filter and provided username are combined to create a search filter that looks like `(&(<filter>)(<attribute>=<username>))`

For example, consider an URL of `ldap://ldap.example.com/o=Acme?cn?sub?(enabled=true)`. When a client attempts to connect using a username of `bob`, the resulting search filter will be `(&(enabled=true)(cn=bob))`.

If the LDAP directory requires authentication to search, specify a `bindDN` and `bindPassword` to use to perfom the entry search.

<3> When `true`, unauthenticated token requests from web clients (like the web console) are redirected to a login page backed by this provider.
<4> List of attributes to use as the identity. First non-empty attribute is used. At least one attribute is required. If none of the listed attribute have a value, authentication fails. 
<5> List of attributes to use as the preferred user name when provisioning a user for this identity. First non-empty attribute is used.
<6> List of attributes to use as the display name. First non-empty attribute is used.
<7> List of attributes to use as the email address. First non-empty attribute is used.
<8> Optional DN to use to bind during the search phase.
<9> Optional password to use to bind during the search phase.
<10> Certificate bundle to use to validate server certificates for the configured URL. If empty, system trusted roots are used. Only applies if `insecure: false`
<11> When `true`, no TLS connection is made to the server. When `false`, ldaps:// URLs connect using TLS, and ldap:// urls are upgraded to TLS.
<12> An RFC 2255 URL which specifies the LDAP host and search parameters to use, as described above.
====

[[BasicAuthPasswordIdentityProvider]]

=== Basic Authentication (Remote)

Set `*BasicAuthPasswordIdentityProvider*` in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to
validate user names and passwords against a remote server using a
server-to-server Basic authentication request. User names and passwords are
validated against a remote URL that is protected by Basic authentication and
returns JSON.

A `401` response indicates failed authentication.

A non-`200` status, or the presence of a non-empty "error" key, indicates an error:

----
{"error":"Error message"}
----

A `200` status with a `sub` (subject) key indicates success:

----
{"sub":"userid"} <1>
----
<1> The subject must be unique to the authenticated user and must not be able to be modified.

A successful response may optionally provide additional data, such as:

* A display name using the `name` key. For example:
+
----
{"sub":"userid", "name": "User Name", ...}
----
+
* An email address using the `email` key. For example:
+
----
{"sub":"userid", "email":"user@example.com", ...}
----
+
* A preferred user name using the `preferred_username` key. This is useful when the unique, unchangeable subject is a database key or UID, and a more human-readable name exists. This is used as a hint when provisioning the OpenShift user for the authenticated identity. For example:
+
----
{"sub":"014fbff9a07c", "preferred_username":"bob", ...}
----

      certFile: /path/to/client.crt <6>
      keyFile: /path/to/client.key <7>
----
<1> This provider name is prefixed to the returned user ID to form an identity
name.
<2> When `true`, unauthenticated token requests from non-web clients (like the
CLI) are sent a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge header for this provider.
<3> When `true`, unauthenticated token requests from web clients (like the web
console) are redirected to a login page backed by this provider.
<4> URL accepting credentials in Basic authentication headers.
<5> Optional: Certificate bundle to use to validate server certificates for the
configured URL.
<6> Optional: Client certificate to present when making requests to the
configured URL.
<7> Key for the client certificate. Required if `*certFile*` is specified.
====

[[RequestHeaderIdentityProvider]]

=== Request Header

Set `*RequestHeaderIdentityProvider*` in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to
identify users from request header values, such as `X-Remote-User`. It is
typically used in combination with an authenticating proxy, which sets the
request header value.  This is similar to how
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/OpenShift_Enterprise/2/html/Deployment_Guide/Configuring_OpenShift_Enterprise_Authentication.html[the
remote user plugin] allowed admins to provider Kerberos, LDAP and many other
forms of Enterprise authentication.

      clientCA: /path/to/client-ca.file <4>
      headers: <5>
      - X-Remote-User
      - SSO-User
----
<1> This provider name is prefixed to the user name in the request header to
form an identity name.
<2> `*RequestHeaderIdentityProvider*` cannot be used to send `WWW-Authenticate`
challenges.
<3> `*RequestHeaderIdentityProvider*` cannot be used to back a login page.
<4> Optional: PEM-encoded certificate bundle. If set, a valid client certificate
must be presented and validated against the certificate authorities in the
specified file before the request headers are checked for user names.
<5> Header names to check, in order, for user names. The first header containing
a value is used as the user name. Required, case-insensitive.
====

.Apache Authentication Using `*RequestHeaderIdentityProvider*`
====

This example configures an authentication proxy on the same host as the master.
Apache is not strictly required and this can serve as a reference configuration
for other proxies. Having the proxy and master on the same host is merely a
convenience and may not be suitable for your environment. For example, if you
were already running the router on the master, then port 443 would not be
available.

----
# yum install -y httpd mod_ssl <1>

# oadm create-signer-cert \
  --cert='/etc/openshift/master/proxyca.crt' \//<2>
  --key='/etc/openshift/master/proxyca.key' \
  --name='openshift-proxy-signer@1432232228' \

  --signer-serial='/etc/openshift/master/proxyca.serial.txt' \
  --user='system:proxy' <4>

# pushd /etc/openshift/master
# cp master.server.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt <5>
# cp master.server.key /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key
# cp ca.crt /etc/pki/CA/certs/ca.crt
# cat proxy/system\:proxy.crt \
  proxy/system\:proxy.key > \
  /etc/pki/tls/certs/authproxy.pem
# popd
----

<1> Install the prerequisites.
<2> Generate a CA for validating requests that submit the trusted header. This
CA should be used as the file name for `clientCA` in the
link:#requestheader-master-ca-config[master's identity provider configuration].
<3> Generate a client certificate for the proxy. This can be done using any
x509 certificate tooling. For convenience, the `oadm` tool can be used.
<4> The user name can be anything, however it's useful to give it a descriptive
name since it will appear in logs.
<5> When running the authentication proxy on a different hostname than the
master, it is important to generate a certificate that matches the host name
instead of using the default master certificate as shown above. The value for
`masterPublicURL` in the *_/etc/openshift/master/master-config.yaml_* file must
be included in the `X509v3 Subject Alternative Name` in the certificate that is
specified for `SSLCertificateFile`. If a new certificate needs to be created,
the `oadm create-server-cert` command can be used.

*Apache Configuration*

Unlike OpenShift Enterprise version 2, this proxy does not need to reside on the
same host as the master. It uses a client certificate to connect to the master,
which is configured to trust the `X-Remote-User` header.

# HTTPS.

  # The value here will be important to tune for your performance needs.  At
  # some point Apache has to clean up stale connections.  The proxy is unable
  # to differenciate stale connections with say 'oc log -f' on a pod that
  # simply isn't outputing anything.  There are likely many other ProxyPass

  # /outh/token/display OpenShift will check one of the
  # ORIGIN_AUTH_REQUEST_HANDLERS to see if the request is authenticated.
  # Technically it would require authentication for /oauth/token/display simply
  # by modifying these two ProxyMatch stanzas.
  <ProxyMatch /oauth/token/.*>
    Allow from all
  </ProxyMatch>

  # /oauth/authorize and /oauth/approve should be protected by Apache.
  <ProxyMatch /oauth/a.*>

    # For Kerberos remove "AuthType basic" and insert the following:
    # AuthType Kerberos
    # KrbMethodNegotiate on
    # KrbMethodK5Passwd off
    # KrbServiceName Any

    Allow from env=passthrough

    Order Deny,Allow

----

At this point, you can create the users in the system Apache is using to store
accounts information. In this example, file-backed authentication is used:

----
# yum -y install httpd-tools
# touch /etc/openshift/htpasswd
# htpasswd -c /etc/openshift/htpasswd <user_name>
----

*Master Configuration*

In the *_/etc/openshift/master/master-config.yaml_* file, all instances of
`masterPublicURL` and `assetPublicURL` need to match the host name and port for
the Apache VirtualHost:

----
    masterPublicURL: https://ose3-master.example.com:443
    assetPublicURL: https://ose3-master.example.com:443/console/
    publicURL: https://ose3-master.example.com:443/console/
----

[[requestheader-master-ca-config]]The `*identityProviders*` stanza in the
*_/etc/openshift/master/master-config.yaml_* file needs to be updated as well:

----
  identityProviders:
  - name: requestheader
    challenge: false
    login: false
    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: RequestHeaderIdentityProvider
      clientCA: /etc/openshift/master/proxyca.crt
      headers:
      - X-Remote-User
----

Now restart everything:

----
# systemctl restart httpd
# systemctl restart openshift-master
----

*Verification*

Test by bypassing the proxy. You should be able to request a token if you supply
the correct client certificate and header:

----
# curl -L -k -H "X-Remote-User: joe" \
  --cert /etc/pki/tls/certs/authproxy.pem \
  https://ose3-master.example.com:8443/oauth/token/request
----

If you do not supply the client certificate, the request should be denied:

----
# curl -L -k -H "X-Remote-User: joe" \
  https://ose3-master.example.com:8443/oauth/token/request
----

*Handling Logouts from the Web Console*

The link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.html[web
console] manages its own sessions. When a user authenticates to Apache, in this
case there is another session at play. By default if the user clicks the logout
link from the web console, it only clears out the session cookie and delete the
token. However, Apache still thinks the user is logged in and immediately
triggers another log in.

To handle this case, the web console's Asset Server has a setting that allows
admins to specify a logout URL:

----
assetConfig:
  logoutURL: "https://ose3-master.example.com/logout"
----

This page could be another `<Location>` in Apache that loads a static page for
clearing the form of authentication that is in use. This is especially useful
when using `mod_auth_form` in Apache 2.4. Basic Authentication logouts can be
challenging to support across all browsers, so it may simply be useful to
redirect to a page instructing the user to clear their authentication cache or
perhaps run `kdestroy` in the case of Kerberos.

[[OpenID]]

=== OpenID Connect

Set `*OpenIDIdentityProvider*` in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to integrate with
an OpenID Connect identity provider using an
link:http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth[Authorization Code Flow].

NOTE: *ID Token* and *UserInfo* decryptions are not supported.

By default, the `*openid*` scope is requested. If required, extra scopes can be
specified in the `*extraScopes*` field.

Claims are read from the JWT `id_token` returned from the OpenID identity
provider and, if specified, from the JSON returned by the `*UserInfo*` URL.

At least one claim must be configured to use as the user's identity. The
link:http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims[standard
identity claim] is `sub`.

You can also indicate which claims to use as the user's preferred user name,
display name, and email address. If multiple claims are specified, the first one
with a non-empty value is used. The
link:http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims[standard
claims] are:

[horizontal]
`sub`:: The user identity.
`preferred_username`:: The preferred user name when provisioning a user.
`email`:: Email address.
`name`:: Display name.

NOTE: Using an OpenID Connect identity provider requires users to get a token using `_<master>_/oauth/token/request` to use with command-line tools.

[[token-options]]

== Token Options

The OAuth server generates two kinds of tokens:

[horizontal]
Access tokens:: Longer-lived tokens that grant access to the API.
Authorize codes:: Short-lived tokens whose only use is to be exchanged for
an access token.

Use the `*tokenConfig*` stanza to set token options:

.Master Configuration Token Options
====

----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  tokenConfig:
    accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds: 86400 <1>
    authorizeTokenMaxAgeSeconds: 300 <2>
----
<1> Set `*accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds*` to control the lifetime of access tokens.
The default lifetime is 24 hours.
<2> Set `*authorizeTokenMaxAgeSeconds*` to control the lifetime of authorize
codes. The default lifetime is five minutes.
====

[[grant-options]]

== Grant Options

To configure how the OAuth server responds to token requests for a client the
user has not previously granted permission, set the `*method*` value in the
`*grantConfig*` stanza. Valid values for `*method*` are:

[horizontal]
`auto`:: Auto-approve the grant and retry the request.
`prompt`:: Prompt the user to approve or deny the grant.
`deny`:: Auto-deny the grant and return a failure error to the client.

oauthConfig:
  ...
  grantConfig:
    method: auto

====

[[session-options]]

== Session Options

The OAuth server uses a signed and encrypted cookie-based session during login
and redirect flows.

Use the `*sessionConfig*` stanza to set session options:

.Master Configuration Session Options
====

----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  sessionConfig:
    sessionMaxAgeSeconds: 300 <1>
    sessionName: ssn <2>
    sessionSecretsFile: "..." <3>
----
<1> Controls the maximum age of a session; sessions auto-expire once a token request is complete. If link:#grant-options[auto-grant] is not enabled, sessions must last as long as the user is expected to take to approve or reject a client authorization request.
<2> Name of the cookie used to store the session.
<3> File name containing serialized `*SessionSecrets*` object. If empty, a random signing and encryption secret is generated at each server start.
====

If no `*sessionSecretsFile*` is specified, a random signing and encryption
secret is generated at each start of the master server. This means that any
logins in progress will have their sessions invalidated if the master is
restarted. It also means that if multiple masters are configured, they will not
be able to decode sessions generated by one of the other masters.

To specify the signing and encryption secret to use, specify a
`*sessionSecretsFile*`. This allows you separate secret values from the
configuration file and keep the configuration file distributable, for example
for debugging purposes.

Multiple secrets can be specified in the `*sessionSecretsFile*` to enable
rotation. New sessions are signed and encrypted using the first secret in the
list. Existing sessions are decrypted and authenticated by each secret until one
succeeds.

.Session Secret Configuration:
====

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: SessionSecrets
secrets: <1>
- authentication: "..." <2>
  encryption: "..." <3>
- authentication: "..."
  encryption: "..."
...
----
<1> List of secrets used to authenticate and encrypt cookie sessions. At least one secret must be specified. Each secret must set an authentication and encryption secret.
<2> Signing secret, used to authenticate sessions using HMAC. Recommended to use a secret with 32 or 64 bytes.
<3> Encrypting secret, used to encrypt sessions. Must be 16, 24, or 32 characters long, to select AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256.
