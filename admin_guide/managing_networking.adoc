== Overview

This topic describes the management of the overall xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/networking.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-networking[cluster network],
including project isolation and outbound traffic control.

Pod-level networking features, such as per-pod bandwidth limits, are discussed
in xref:../admin_guide/managing_pods.adoc#admin-guide-manage-pods[Managing
Pods].

[[joining-project-networks]]
=== Joining Project Networks

To join projects to an existing project network:

----
$ oadm pod-network join-projects --to=<project1> <project2> <project3>
----

In the above example, all the pods and services in `<project2>` and `<project3>`
can now access any pods and services in `<project1>` and vice versa. Services
can be accessed either by IP or fully-qualified DNS name
(`<service>.<pod_namespace>.svc.cluster.local`). For example, to access a
service named `db` in a project `myproject`, use `db.myproject.svc.cluster.local`.

Alternatively, instead of specifying specific project names, you can use the
`--selector=<project_selector>` option.

[[isolating-project-networks]]
== Isolating Project Networks

To isolate the project network in the cluster and vice versa, run:

----
$ oadm pod-network isolate-projects <project1> <project2>
----

In the above example, all of the pods and services in `<project1>` and
`<project2>` can _not_ access any pods and services from other non-global
projects in the cluster and vice versa.

Alternatively, instead of specifying specific project names, you can use the
`--selector=<project_selector>` option.

[[making-project-networks-global]]
=== Making Project Networks Global

To allow projects to access all pods and services in the cluster and vice versa:

----
$ oadm pod-network make-projects-global <project1> <project2>
----

In the above example, all the pods and services in `<project1>` and `<project2>`
can now access any pods and services in the cluster and vice versa.

Alternatively, instead of specifying specific project names, you can use the
`--selector=<project_selector>` option.

[[admin-guide-disabling-hostname-collision]]
== Disabling Host Name Collision Prevention For Ingress Objects

In {product-title}, host name collision prevention for routes and ingress
objects is enabled by default. This means that the host name in a route or
ingress object can only be set on creation and not edited afterwards. Disabling
host name collision prevention lets you edit a host name for ingress objects after creation.
However, because {product-title} uses the object creation timestamp to determine
the oldest route or ingress object for a given host name, the route or ingress
object can hijack a host name with a newer route. This can happen if an older
route changes its host name, or if an ingress object is introduced.

This is relevant to {product-title} installations that depend upon Kubernetes
behavior, including allowing the host names in ingress objects be edited.

. Add the following to the `master.yaml` file:
+
[source, yaml]
----
admissionConfig:
  pluginConfig:
    openshift.io/IngressAdmission:
      configuration:
        apiVersion: v1
        allowHostnameChanges: true
        kind: IngressAdmissionConfig
      location: ""
----

. Restart the master service for the changes to take effect:
+
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master

[[admin-guide-controlling-egress-traffic]]
== Controlling Egress Traffic

As a cluster administrator you can allocate a number of static IP addresses to a
specific node at the host level. If an application developer needs a dedicated
IP address for their application service, they can request one during the
process they use to ask for firewall access. They can then deploy an egress
router from the developer's project, using a `*nodeSelector*` in the deployment
configuration to ensure that the pod lands on the host with the pre-allocated
static IP address.

The egress pod's deployment declares one of the source IPs, the destination IP
of the protected service, and a gateway IP to reach the destination. After the
pod is deployed, you can
xref:../dev_guide/integrating_external_services.adoc#dev-guide-integrating-external-services[create
a service] to access the egress router pod, then add that source IP to the
corporate firewall. The developer then has access information to the egress
router service that was created in their project, for example,
`service.project.cluster.domainname.com`.

When the developer needs to access the external, firewalled service, they can
call out to the egress router pod's service
(`service.project.cluster.domainname.com`) in their application (for example,
the JDBC connection information) rather than the actual protected service URL.

As an {product-title} cluster administrator, you can control egress traffic in three ways:

xref:admin-guide-limit-pod-access-egress[Firewall]::
Using an egress firewall allows you to enforce the acceptable outbound traffic
policies, so that specific endpoints or IP ranges (subnets) are the only
acceptable targets for the dynamic endpoints (pods within {product-title}) to
talk to.

xref:admin-guide-limit-pod-access-egress-router[Router]::
Using an egress router allows you to create identifiable services to send
traffic to certain destinations, ensuring those external destinations treat
traffic as though it were coming from a known source. This helps with security,
because it allows you to secure an external database so that only specific pods
in a namespace can talk to a service (the egress router), which proxies the
traffic to your database.

xref:admin-guide-limit-pod-access-iptables[iptables]::
In addition to the above {product-title}-internal solutions, it is also
possible to create iptables rules that will be applied to outgoing
traffic. These rules allow for more possibilities than the egress
firewall, but cannot be limited to particular projects.

[[admin-guide-limit-pod-access-egress]]
=== Using an Egress Firewall to Limit Access to External Resources

As an {product-title} cluster administrator, you can use egress firewall policy
to limit the external addresses that some or all pods can access from within the
cluster, so that:

- A pod can only talk to internal hosts, and cannot initiate connections to the
public Internet.
+
Or,
- A pod can only talk to the public Internet, and cannot initiate connections to
internal hosts (outside the cluster).
+
Or,
- A pod cannot reach specified internal subnets/hosts that it should have no
reason to contact.

You can configure projects to have different egress policies. For example,
allowing `<project A>` access to a specified IP range, but denying the same
access to `<project B>`. Or restrict application developers from updating from
(Python) pip mirrors, and forcing updates to only come from desired sources.

[CAUTION]
====
You must have the
xref:../install_config/configuring_sdn.adoc#install-config-configuring-sdn[*ovs-multitenant* plug-in] enabled in order to limit pod access via egress policy.
====

Project administrators can neither create `EgressNetworkPolicy` objects, nor
edit the ones you create in their project. There are also several other
restrictions on where `EgressNetworkPolicy` can be created:

* The `default` project (and any other project that has been made global via
`oadm pod-network make-projects-global`) cannot have egress policy.

* If you merge two projects together (via `oadm pod-network join-projects`),
then you cannot use egress policy in _any_ of the joined projects.

* No project may have more than one egress policy object.

Violating any of these restrictions results in broken egress policy for the
project, and may cause all external network traffic to be dropped.

Use the `oc` command or the REST API to configure egress policy. You can use
`oc [create|replace|delete]` to manipulate `EgressNetworkPolicy` objects. The
*_api/swagger-spec/oapi-v1.json_* file has API-level details on how the objects
actually work.

To configure egress policy:

. Navigate to the project you want to affect.

. Create a JSON file with the desired policy details. For example:
+
----
{
    "kind": "EgressNetworkPolicy",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "default"
    },
    "spec": {
        "egress": [
            {
                "type": "Allow",
                "to": {
                    "cidrSelector": "1.2.3.0/24"
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "Allow",
                "to": {
                    "dnsName": "www.foo.com"
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "Deny",
                "to": {
                    "cidrSelector": "0.0.0.0/0"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
----
+
When the example above is added to a project, it allows traffic to IP range
`1.2.3.0/24` and domain name `www.foo.com`, but denies access to all other
external IP addresses. Traffic to other pods is not affected because the policy
only applies to _external_ traffic.
+
The rules in an `EgressNetworkPolicy` are checked in order, and the first one
that matches takes effect. If the three rules in the above example were
reversed, then traffic would not be allowed to `1.2.3.0/24` and `www.foo.com`
because the `0.0.0.0/0` rule would be checked first, and it would match and deny
all traffic.
+
Domain name updates are polled based on the TTL (time to live) value of the
domain of the local non-authoritative server, or 30 minutes if the TTL is unable
to be fetched. The pod should also resolve the domain from the same local
non-authoritative server when necessary, otherwise the IP addresses for the
domain perceived by the egress network policy controller and the pod will be
different, and the egress network policy may not be enforced as expected. In the
above example, suppose `www.foo.com` resolved to `10.11.12.13` and has a DNS TTL
of one minute, but was later changed to `20.21.22.23`. {product-title} will then
take up to one minute to adapt to these changes.

. Use the JSON file to create an EgressNetworkPolicy object:
+
----
# oc create -f <policy>.json
----

[CAUTION]
====
Exposing services by creating
xref:../dev_guide/routes.adoc#creating-routes[routes] will ignore
`EgressNetworkPolicy`. Egress network policy service endpoint filtering is done
at the node `kubeproxy`. When the router is involved, `kubeproxy` is bypassed
and egress network policy enforcement is not applied. Administrators can prevent
this bypass by limiting access to create routes.
====

[[admin-guide-limit-pod-access-egress-router]]
=== Using an Egress Router to Allow External Resources to Recognize Pod Traffic

The {product-title} egress router runs a service that redirects traffic to a
specified remote server, using a private source IP address that is not used for
anything else. The service allows pods to talk to servers that are set up
to only allow access from whitelisted IP addresses.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The egress router is not intended for every outgoing connection. Creating large
numbers of egress routers can push the limits of your network hardware. For
example, creating an egress router for every project or application could exceed
the number of local MAC addresses that the network interface can handle before
falling back to filtering MAC addresses in software.
====

[[admin-guide-limit-pod-access-important-deployment-considerations]]
==== Important Deployment Considerations

The Egress router adds a second IP address and MAC address to the node's primary
network interface. If you are not running {product-title} on bare metal, you may
need to configure your hypervisor or cloud provider to allow the additional
address.

*Red Hat OpenStack Platform*

If you are deploying {product-title} on Red Hat OpenStack Platform, you need to
whitelist the IP and MAC addresses on your Openstack environment, otherwise

[[admin-guide-egress-router-modes]]
==== Egress Router Modes

The egress router can run in two different modes:

1. A "redirect" mode, where the egress router sets up iptables rules
to redirect traffic from its own IP address to one or more destination
IP addresses. Client pods that want to make use of the reserved source
IP address will need to be modified to connect to the egress router
rather than connecting directly to the destination IP.

2. An HTTP proxy mode, where the egress router runs as an HTTP proxy.
This only works for clients talking to HTTP/HTTPS-based services, but
usually requires fewer changes to the client pods to get them to work.
(Many programs can be told to use an HTTP proxy just by setting an
environment variable.)

====

. Create the pod using the above definition:
+
----
$ oc create -f <pod_name>.json
----
+
To check to see if the pod has been created:
+
----
oc get pod <pod_name>
----

. Ensure other pods can find the pod's IP address by creating a service to point to the egress router:
+
====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: egress-1
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
  - name: https
    port: 443
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    name: egress-1
----
====
+
Your pods can now connect to this service. Their connections are redirected to
the corresponding ports on the external server, using the reserved egress IP
address.

The work of setting up the egress router is done as an "init
container" by the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*openshift3/ose-egress-router*
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*openshift/origin-egress-router*
endif::openshift-origin[]
image, and that container is run privileged so that it can configure the Macvlan
interface and set up `iptables` rules. After it finishes setting up
the `iptables` rules, it exits and the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*openshift3/ose-pod*
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*openshift/origin-pod*
endif::openshift-origin[]
container will run (doing nothing) until the pod is killed.

The environment variables tell the *egress-router* image what addresses to use; it
will configure the Macvlan interface to use `EGRESS_SOURCE` as its IP address,
with `EGRESS_GATEWAY` as its gateway.

NAT rules are set up so that connections to any TCP or UDP port on the
pod's cluster IP address are redirected to the same port on
`EGRESS_DESTINATION`.

If only some of the nodes in your cluster are capable of claiming the specified
source IP address and using the specified gateway, you can specify a
`nodeName` or `nodeSelector` indicating which nodes are acceptable.

[[admin-guide-manage-pods-egress-router-multi-destination]]
==== Redirecting to Multiple Destinations

In the example above, connections to the egress pod (or its
corresponding service) on any port will be redirected to a single
destination IP. It is also possible to configure different destination
IPs depending on the port:

<1> This uses the YAML syntax for a multi-line string; see below for
details.
====

Each line of `EGRESS_DESTINATION` can be one of three types:

- `<port> <protocol> <IP address>` - This says that incoming
connections to the given `<port>` should be redirected to the same
port on the given `<IP address>`. `<protocol>` is either `tcp` or
`udp`. In the example above, the first line redirects traffic from
local port 80 to port 80 on 203.0.113.25.
- `<port> <protocol> <IP address> <remote port>` - As above, except
that the connection is redirected to a different `<remote port>` on
`<IP address>`. In the example above, the second and third lines
redirect local ports 8080 and 8443 to remote ports 80 and 443 on
203.0.113.26.
- `<fallback IP address>` - If the last line of `EGRESS_DESTINATION`
is a single IP address, then any connections on any other port will be
redirected to the corresponding port on that IP address (eg,
203.0.113.27 in the example above). If there is no fallback IP address
then connections on other ports would simply be rejected.)

[[admin-guide-manage-pods-egress-router-configmap]]
==== Using a ConfigMap to specify EGRESS_DESTINATION

In the case of a large or frequently-changing set of destination
mappings, it may be useful to maintain the list externally in a
ConfigMap, and have the egress router pod read it from there. This
also has the advantage that project administrators would be able to
edit the ConfigMap (whereas they may not be able to edit the Pod
definition directly, since it contains a privileged container).

To do this:

. Create a file containing the `EGRESS_DESTINATION` data:
+
----
$ cat my-egress-destination.txt
# Egress routes for Project "Test", version 3

80   tcp 203.0.113.25

8080 tcp 203.0.113.26 80
8443 tcp 203.0.113.26 443

# Fallback
203.0.113.27
----
+
Note that you can put blank lines and comments into this file

. Create a ConfigMap object from the file:
+
----
$ oc delete configmap egress-routes --ignore-not-found
$ oc create configmap egress-routes --from-file=destination=my-egress-destination.txt
----
+
Here `egress-routes` is the name of the ConfigMap object being
created and `my-egress-destination.txt` is the name of the file the
data is being read from.

. Create a egress router pod definition as above, but specifying the
ConfigMap for `EGRESS_DESTINATION` in the environment section:
+
----
    ...
    env:
    - name: EGRESS_SOURCE
      value: 192.168.12.99
    - name: EGRESS_GATEWAY
      value: 192.168.12.1
    - name: EGRESS_DESTINATION
      valueFrom:
        configMapKeyRef:
          name: egress-routes
          key: destination
    - name: EGRESS_ROUTER_MODE
      value: init
    ...
----

Note that the egress router will not automatically update when the
ConfigMap changes; you will need to restart the pod to get updates.

==== Deploying an Egress Router HTTP Proxy Pod

You can specify a variety of things for
`EGRESS_HTTP_PROXY_DESTINATION`. The simplest is to just specify `*`,
meaning "allow connections to all remote destinations". Other than
that, each line specifies one group of connections to allow or deny:

- An IP address (eg, `192.168.1.1`) will allow connections to that IP address.
- A CIDR range (eg, `192.168.1.0/24`) will allow connections to that CIDR range.
- A hostname (eg, `www.example.com`) will allow proxying to that host.
- A domain name preceded by `\*.` (eg, `*.example.com`) will allow proxying to that domain and all of its subdomains.
- A `!` followed by any of the above will deny connections rather than allowing them
- If the last line is `*`, then anything that hasn't been denied will be allowed. Otherwise, anything that hasn't been allowed will be denied.

You can also specify the `EGRESS_HTTP_PROXY_DESTINATION` using a
ConfigMap, similarly to
<<admin-guide-manage-pods-egress-router-configmap,the example with a
redirecting egress router above>>.

==== Enabling Failover for Egress Router Pods

Using a replication controller, you can ensure that there is always one copy of the egress router pod in order to prevent downtime.

. Create a replication controller configuration file using the following:
+
====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: egress-demo-controller
spec:
  replicas: 1 <1>
  selector:
    name: egress-demo
  template:
    metadata:
      name: egress-demo
      labels:
        name: egress-demo
      annotations:
        pod.network.openshift.io/assign-macvlan: "true"
    spec:
      initContainers:
      - name: egress-demo-init
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
        image: registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-egress-router
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
        image: openshift/origin-egress-router
endif::openshift-origin[]
        env:
        - name: EGRESS_SOURCE
          value: 192.168.12.99
        - name: EGRESS_GATEWAY
          value: 192.168.12.1
        - name: EGRESS_DESTINATION
          value: 203.0.113.25
        - name: EGRESS_ROUTER_MODE
          value: init
        securityContext:
          privileged: true
      containers:
      - name: egress-demo-wait
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
        image: registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-pod
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
        image: openshift/origin-pod
endif::openshift-origin[]
      nodeSelector:
        site: springfield-1
----
<1> Ensure `replicas` is set to `1`, because only one pod can be using a given
`EGRESS_SOURCE` value at any time. This means that only a single copy of the
router will be running, on a node with the label `site=springfield-1`.
====

. Create the pod using the definition:
+
----
$ oc create -f <replication_controller>.json
----

. To verify, check to see if the replication controller pod has been created:
+
----
oc describe rc <replication_controller>

[[admin-guide-limit-pod-access-iptables]]
=== Using iptables Rules to Limit Access to External Resources

Some cluster administrators may want to perform actions on outgoing
traffic that do not fit within the model of `EgressNetworkPolicy` or the
egress router. In some cases, this can be done by creating iptables
rules directly.

For example, you could create rules that log traffic to particular
destinations, or to prevent more than a certain number of outgoing
connections per second.

{product-title} does not provide a way to add custom iptables rules
automatically, but it does provide a place where such rules can be
added manually by the administrator. Each node, on startup, will
create an empty chain called `OPENSHIFT-ADMIN-OUTPUT-RULES` in the
`filter` table (assuming that the chain does not already exist). Any
rules added to that chain by an administrator will be applied to all
traffic going from a pod to a destination outside the cluster (and not
to any other traffic).

There are a few things to watch out for when using this functionality:

. It is up to you to ensure that rules get created on each node;
{product-title} does not provide any way to make that happen
automatically.

. The rules are not applied to traffic that exits the cluster via an
egress router, and they run after `EgressNetworkPolicy` rules are applied
(and so will not see traffic that is denied by an
`EgressNetworkPolicy`).

. The handling of connections from pods to nodes or pods to the master
is complicated, because nodes have both "external" IP addresses and
"internal" SDN IP addresses. Thus, some pod-to-node/master traffic may
pass through this chain, but other pod-to-node/master traffic may
bypass it.

== Enabling Multicast

[IMPORTANT]
====
Enabling multicast networking is a Technology Preview feature only.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to
upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide
feedback during the development process.

Multicast traffic between {product-title} pods is disabled by default. You can
enable Multicast on a per-project basis by setting an annotation on the
project's corresponding `netnamespace` object:

----
# oc annotate netnamespace <namespace> \
    netnamespace.network.openshift.io/multicast-enabled=true
----

Disable multicast by removing the annotation:

----
# oc annotate netnamespace <namespace> \
    netnamespace.network.openshift.io/multicast-enabled-
----

If you have
xref:../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#joining-project-networks[joined
networks together], you will need to enable Multicast in each projects'
`netnamespace` in order for it to take effect in any of the projects. To enable
Multicast in the `default` project, you must also enable it in all other
projects that have been
xref:../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#making-project-networks-global[made
global].

[NOTE]
====
Multicast global projects are not "global", but instead communicate with only
other global projects via Multicast, not with all projects in the cluster, as is
the case with unicast.

== Enabling NetworkPolicy

[IMPORTANT]
====
Enabling the Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` is a Technology Preview feature only.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to

Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` is not currently fully supported by {product-title},
and the *ovs-subnet* and *ovs-multitenant* plug-ins ignore `NetworkPolicy`
objects. However, a Technology Preview of `NetworkPolicy` support is available by
using the *ovs-networkpolicy* plug-in.

In a cluster
xref:../install_config/configuring_sdn.adoc#install-config-configuring-sdn[configured
to use the *ovs-networkpolicy* plug-in], network isolation is controlled
entirely by `NetworkPolicy` objects and the link:https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/network-policy.md[associated Namespace annotation]. In particular, by default, all projects are able to access pods
in all other projects. The project to be isolated must first be configured to
opt in to isolation by setting the proper annotation on its Namespace object,
and then creating `NetworkPolicy` objects indicating the incoming connections to
be allowed.
