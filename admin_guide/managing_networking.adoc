== Overview

This topic describes the management of the overall
xref:../architecture/networking/networking.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-networking[cluster
network], including project isolation and outbound traffic control.

Pod-level networking features, such as per-pod bandwidth limits, are discussed
in xref:../admin_guide/managing_pods.adoc#admin-guide-manage-pods[Managing
Pods].

[[admin-guide-pod-network]]
== Managing Pod Networks

When your cluster is configured to use
xref:../architecture/networking/sdn.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-sdn[the *ovs-multitenant* SDN
plug-in], you can manage the separate pod overlay networks for projects using
the administrator CLI.

[[joining-project-networks]]
=== Joining Project Networks

To join projects to an existing project network:

----
$ oadm pod-network join-projects --to=<project1> <project2> <project3>
----

In the above example, all the pods and services in `<project2>` and `<project3>`
can now access any pods and services in `<project1>` and vice versa. Services
can be accessed either by IP or fully-qualified DNS name
(`<service>.<pod_namespace>.svc.cluster.local`). For example, to access a
service named `db` in a project `myproject`, use `db.myproject.svc.cluster.local`.

Alternatively, instead of specifying specific project names, you can use the
`--selector=<project_selector>` option.

[[isolating-project-networks]]
== Isolating Project Networks

To isolate the project network in the cluster and vice versa, run:

----
$ oadm pod-network isolate-projects <project1> <project2>
----

In the above example, all of the pods and services in `<project1>` and
`<project2>` can _not_ access any pods and services from other non-global
projects in the cluster and vice versa.

Alternatively, instead of specifying specific project names, you can use the
`--selector=<project_selector>` option.

[[making-project-networks-global]]
=== Making Project Networks Global

To allow projects to access all pods and services in the cluster and vice versa:

----
$ oadm pod-network make-projects-global <project1> <project2>
----

In the above example, all the pods and services in `<project1>` and `<project2>`
can now access any pods and services in the cluster and vice versa.

Alternatively, instead of specifying specific project names, you can use the
`--selector=<project_selector>` option.

[[admin-guide-disabling-hostname-collision]]
== Disabling Host Name Collision Prevention For Ingress Objects

In {product-title}, host name collision prevention for routes and ingress
objects is enabled by default. This means that the host name in a route or
ingress object can only be set on creation and not edited afterwards. Disabling
host name collision prevention lets you edit a host name for ingress objects after creation.
However, because {product-title} uses the object creation timestamp to determine
the oldest route or ingress object for a given host name, the route or ingress
object can hijack a host name with a newer route. This can happen if an older
route changes its host name, or if an ingress object is introduced.

This is relevant to {product-title} installations that depend upon Kubernetes
behavior, including allowing the host names in ingress objects be edited.

. Add the following to the `master.yaml` file:
+
[source, yaml]
----
admissionConfig:
  pluginConfig:
    openshift.io/IngressAdmission:
      configuration:
        apiVersion: v1
        allowHostnameChanges: true
        kind: IngressAdmissionConfig
      location: ""
----

. Restart the master service for the changes to take effect:
+
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master
----

[[admin-guide-controlling-egress-traffic]]
== Controlling Egress Traffic
As an {product-title} cluster administrator, you can control egress traffic in three ways:

xref:admin-guide-limit-pod-access-egress[Firewall]::
Using an egress firewall allows you to enforce the acceptable outbound traffic
policies, so that specific endpoints or IP ranges (subnets) are the only
acceptable targets for the dynamic endpoints (pods within {product-title}) to
talk to.

xref:admin-guide-limit-pod-access-egress-router[Router]::
Using an egress router allows you to create identifiable services to send
traffic to certain destinations, ensuring those external destinations treat
traffic as though it were coming from a known source. This helps with security,
because it allows you to secure an external database so that only specific pods
in a namespace can talk to a service (the egress router), which proxies the
traffic to your database.

xref:admin-guide-limit-pod-access-iptables[iptables]::
In addition to the above {product-title}-internal solutions, it is also
possible to create iptables rules that will be applied to outgoing
traffic. These rules allow for more possibilities than the egress
firewall, but cannot be limited to particular projects.

[[admin-guide-limit-pod-access-egress]]
=== Using an Egress Firewall to Limit Access to External Resources

As an {product-title} cluster administrator, you can use egress firewall policy
to limit the external addresses that some or all pods can access from within the
cluster, so that:

- A pod can only talk to internal hosts, and cannot initiate connections to the
public Internet.
+
Or,
- A pod can only talk to the public Internet, and cannot initiate connections to
internal hosts (outside the cluster).
+
Or,
- A pod cannot reach specified internal subnets/hosts that it should have no
reason to contact.

You can configure projects to have different egress policies. For example,
allowing `<project A>` access to a specified IP range, but denying the same
access to `<project B>`. Or restrict application developers from updating from
(Python) pip mirrors, and forcing updates to only come from desired sources.

[CAUTION]
====
You must have the
xref:../install_config/configuring_sdn.adoc#install-config-configuring-sdn[*ovs-multitenant* plug-in] enabled in order to limit pod access via egress policy.
====

Project administrators can neither create `EgressNetworkPolicy` objects, nor
edit the ones you create in their project. There are also several other
restrictions on where `EgressNetworkPolicy` can be created:

* The `default` project (and any other project that has been made global via
`oadm pod-network make-projects-global`) cannot have egress policy.

* If you merge two projects together (via `oadm pod-network join-projects`),
then you cannot use egress policy in _any_ of the joined projects.

* No project may have more than one egress policy object.

Violating any of these restrictions results in broken egress policy for the
project, and may cause all external network traffic to be dropped.

Use the `oc` command or the REST API to configure egress policy. You can use
`oc [create|replace|delete]` to manipulate `EgressNetworkPolicy` objects. The
*_api/swagger-spec/oapi-v1.json_* file has API-level details on how the objects
actually work.

To configure egress policy:

. Navigate to the project you want to affect.

. Create a JSON file with the desired policy details. For example:
+
----
{
    "kind": "EgressNetworkPolicy",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "default"
    },
    "spec": {
        "egress": [
            {
                "type": "Allow",
                "to": {
                    "cidrSelector": "1.2.3.0/24"
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "Allow",
                "to": {
                    "dnsName": "www.foo.com"
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "Deny",
                "to": {
                    "cidrSelector": "0.0.0.0/0"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
----
+
When the example above is added to a project, it allows traffic to IP range
`1.2.3.0/24` and domain name `www.foo.com`, but denies access to all other
external IP addresses. Traffic to other pods is not affected because the policy
only applies to _external_ traffic.
+
The rules in an `EgressNetworkPolicy` are checked in order, and the first one
that matches takes effect. If the three rules in the above example were
reversed, then traffic would not be allowed to `1.2.3.0/24` and `www.foo.com`
because the `0.0.0.0/0` rule would be checked first, and it would match and deny
all traffic.
+
Domain name updates are polled based on the TTL (time to live) value of the
domain of the local non-authoritative server, or 30 minutes if the TTL is unable
to be fetched. The pod should also resolve the domain from the same local
non-authoritative server when necessary, otherwise the IP addresses for the
domain perceived by the egress network policy controller and the pod will be
different, and the egress network policy may not be enforced as expected. In the
above example, suppose `www.foo.com` resolved to `10.11.12.13` and has a DNS TTL
of one minute, but was later changed to `20.21.22.23`. {product-title} will then
take up to one minute to adapt to these changes.
+
[NOTE]
====
The egress firewall always allows pods access to the external interface of the
node the pod is on for DNS resolution. If your DNS resolution is not handled by
something on the local node, then you will need to add egress firewall rules
allowing access to the DNS server's IP addresses if you are using domain names
in your pods. The xref:../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[default installer]
sets up a local dnsmasq, so if you are using that setup you will not need to add extra rules.
====


. Use the JSON file to create an EgressNetworkPolicy object:
+
----
# oc create -f <policy>.json
----

[CAUTION]
====
Exposing services by creating
xref:../dev_guide/routes.adoc#creating-routes[routes] will ignore
`EgressNetworkPolicy`. Egress network policy service endpoint filtering is done
at the node `kubeproxy`. When the router is involved, `kubeproxy` is bypassed
and egress network policy enforcement is not applied. Administrators can prevent
this bypass by limiting access to create routes.
====

[[admin-guide-limit-pod-access-egress-router]]
=== Using an Egress Router to Allow External Resources to Recognize Pod Traffic

The {product-title} egress router runs a service that redirects traffic to a
specified remote server, using a private source IP address that is not used for
anything else. The service allows pods to talk to servers that are set up
to only allow access from whitelisted IP addresses.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The egress router is not intended for every outgoing connection. Creating large
numbers of egress routers can push the limits of your network hardware. For
example, creating an egress router for every project or application could exceed
the number of local MAC addresses that the network interface can handle before
falling back to filtering MAC addresses in software.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, the egress router is not compatible with Amazon AWS due to AWS not
being compatible with macvlan traffic.
====

[[admin-guide-limit-pod-access-important-deployment-considerations]]
*Deployment Considerations*

The Egress router adds a second IP address and MAC address to the node's primary
network interface. If you are not running {product-title} on bare metal, you may
need to configure your hypervisor or cloud provider to allow the additional
address.

Red Hat OpenStack Platform::

If you are deploying {product-title} on Red Hat OpenStack Platform, you need to
whitelist the IP and MAC addresses on your OpenStack environment, otherwise

+
----
neutron port-update $neutron_port_uuid \

Hat Enterprise Virtualization], you should set
`EnableMACAntiSpoofingFilterRules` to `false`.

VMware vSphere::

If you are using VMware vSphere, see the link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.0/com.vmware.vsphere.security.doc/GUID-3507432E-AFEA-4B6B-B404-17A020575358.html[VMWare documentation for securing vSphere standard switches].

[[admin-guide-egress-router-modes]]
*Egress Router Modes*

The egress router can run in two different modes:
xref:admin-guide-deploying-an-egress-router-pod[redirect mode] and
xref:admin-guide-deploying-an-egress-router-http-proxy-pod[HTTP proxy mode].
Redirect mode works for all services except for HTTP and HTTPS. For HTTP and
HTTPS services, use HTTP proxy mode.


[[admin-guide-deploying-an-egress-router-pod]]
==== Deploying an Egress Router Pod in Redirect Mode

In _redirect mode_, the egress router sets up iptables rules to redirect traffic
from its own IP address to one or more destination IP addresses. Client pods
that want to make use of the reserved source IP address must be modified to
connect to the egress router rather than connecting directly to the destination
IP.

. Create a pod configuration using the following:
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: egress-1
  labels:
    name: egress-1
  annotations:
    pod.network.openshift.io/assign-macvlan: "true" <1>
spec:
  initContainers:
  - name: egress-router

    securityContext:
      privileged: true
    env:
    - name: EGRESS_SOURCE <2>
      value: 192.168.12.99
    - name: EGRESS_GATEWAY <3>
      value: 192.168.12.1
    - name: EGRESS_DESTINATION <4>
      value: 203.0.113.25
    - name: EGRESS_ROUTER_MODE <5>

endif::openshift-origin[]
  nodeSelector:
    site: springfield-1 <6>
----
<1> The `pod.network.openshift.io/assign-macvlan annotation` creates a Macvlan
network interface on the primary network interface, and then moves it into the
pod's network name space before starting the *egress-router* container. Preserve
the quotation marks around `"true"`. Omitting them results in errors.
<2> IP address from the physical network that the node is on and is
reserved by the cluster administrator for use by this pod.
<3> Same value as the default gateway used by the node.
<4> The external server to direct traffic to. Using this example,
connections to the pod are redirected to 203.0.113.25, with a source IP address
of 192.168.12.99.
<5> This tells the egress router image that it is being deployed as an
"init container". Previous versions of {product-title} (and the egress
router image) did not support this mode and had to be run as an
ordinary container.
<6> The pod is only deployed to nodes with the label `site=springfield-1`.

. Create the pod using the above definition:
+
----
$ oc create -f <pod_name>.json
----
+
To check to see if the pod has been created:
+
----
oc get pod <pod_name>
----

. Ensure other pods can find the pod's IP address by creating a service to point to the egress router:
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: egress-1
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
  - name: https
    port: 443
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    name: egress-1
----
+
Your pods can now connect to this service. Their connections are redirected to
the corresponding ports on the external server, using the reserved egress IP
address.

The egress router setup is performed by an "init container" created from the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*openshift3/ose-egress-router*
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*openshift/origin-egress-router*
endif::openshift-origin[]
image, and that container is run privileged so that it can configure the Macvlan
interface and set up `iptables` rules. After it finishes setting up
the `iptables` rules, it exits and the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*openshift3/ose-pod*
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*openshift/origin-pod*
endif::openshift-origin[]
container will run (doing nothing) until the pod is killed.

The environment variables tell the *egress-router* image what addresses to use; it
will configure the Macvlan interface to use `EGRESS_SOURCE` as its IP address,
with `EGRESS_GATEWAY` as its gateway.

NAT rules are set up so that connections to any TCP or UDP port on the
pod's cluster IP address are redirected to the same port on
`EGRESS_DESTINATION`.

If only some of the nodes in your cluster are capable of claiming the specified
source IP address and using the specified gateway, you can specify a
`nodeName` or `nodeSelector` indicating which nodes are acceptable.

[[admin-guide-manage-pods-egress-router-multi-destination]]
==== Redirecting to Multiple Destinations

In the previous example, connections to the egress pod (or its corresponding
service) on any port are redirected to a single destination IP. You can also
configure different destination IPs depending on the port:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: egress-multi
  labels:

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
    image: openshift/origin-pod
endif::openshift-origin[]
----
<1> This uses the YAML syntax for a multi-line string; see below for
details.

Each line of `EGRESS_DESTINATION` can be one of three types:

- `<port> <protocol> <IP address>` - This says that incoming
connections to the given `<port>` should be redirected to the same
port on the given `<IP address>`. `<protocol>` is either `tcp` or
`udp`. In the example above, the first line redirects traffic from
local port 80 to port 80 on 203.0.113.25.
- `<port> <protocol> <IP address> <remote port>` - As above, except
that the connection is redirected to a different `<remote port>` on
`<IP address>`. In the example above, the second and third lines
redirect local ports 8080 and 8443 to remote ports 80 and 443 on
203.0.113.26.
- `<fallback IP address>` - If the last line of `EGRESS_DESTINATION`
is a single IP address, then any connections on any other port will be
redirected to the corresponding port on that IP address (eg,
203.0.113.27 in the example above). If there is no fallback IP address
then connections on other ports would simply be rejected.)

[[admin-guide-manage-pods-egress-router-configmap]]
==== Using a ConfigMap to specify EGRESS_DESTINATION

For a large or frequently-changing set of destination mappings, you
can use a ConfigMap to externally maintain the list, and have the egress router
pod read it from there. This comes with the advantage of project administrators
being able to edit the ConfigMap, whereas they may not be able to edit the Pod
definition directly, because it contains a privileged container.

. Create a file containing the `EGRESS_DESTINATION` data:
+
----
$ cat my-egress-destination.txt
# Egress routes for Project "Test", version 3

80   tcp 203.0.113.25

8080 tcp 203.0.113.26 80
8443 tcp 203.0.113.26 443

# Fallback
203.0.113.27
----
+
Note that you can put blank lines and comments into this file

. Create a ConfigMap object from the file:
+
----
$ oc delete configmap egress-routes --ignore-not-found
$ oc create configmap egress-routes \
  --from-file=destination=my-egress-destination.txt
----
+
Here `egress-routes` is the name of the ConfigMap object being
created and `my-egress-destination.txt` is the name of the file the
data is being read from.

. Create a egress router pod definition as above, but specifying the
ConfigMap for `EGRESS_DESTINATION` in the environment section:
+
[source, yaml]
----
    ...
    env:
    - name: EGRESS_SOURCE
      value: 192.168.12.99
    - name: EGRESS_GATEWAY
      value: 192.168.12.1
    - name: EGRESS_DESTINATION
      valueFrom:
        configMapKeyRef:
          name: egress-routes
          key: destination
    - name: EGRESS_ROUTER_MODE
      value: init
    ...
----

[NOTE]
====
The egress router does not automatically update when the ConfigMap changes.
Restart the pod to get updates.
====

[[admin-guide-deploying-an-egress-router-http-proxy-pod]]
==== Deploying an Egress Router HTTP Proxy Pod

In _HTTP proxy mode_, the egress router runs as an HTTP proxy on port `8080`.
This only works for clients talking to HTTP or HTTPS-based services, but usually
requires fewer changes to the client pods to get them to work. Programs can be
told to use an HTTP proxy by setting an environment variable.

. Create the pod using the following as an example:
+
[source, yaml]

- A domain name preceded by `\*.` (eg, `*.example.com`) allows proxying to that domain and all of its subdomains.
- A `!` followed by any of the above denies connections rather than allowing them
- If the last line is `*`, then anything that hasn't been denied will be allowed. Otherwise, anything that hasn't been allowed will be denied.

. Ensure other pods can find the pod's IP address by creating a service to point
to the egress router:
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: egress-1
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http-proxy
    port: 8080 <1>
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    name: egress-1
----
<1> Ensure the `http` port is always set to `8080`.

. Configure the client pod (not the egress proxy pod) to use the HTTP proxy by setting the `http_proxy` or `https_proxy` variables:
+
[source, yaml]
----
    ...
    env:
    - name: http_proxy
      value: http://egress-1:8080/ <1>
    - name: https_proxy
      value: http://egress-1:8080/
    ...
----
<1> The service created in step 2.
+
[NOTE]
====
Using the `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` environment variables is not necessary
for all setups. If the above does not create a working setup, then consult the
documentation for the tool or software you are running in the pod.
====

You can also specify the `EGRESS_HTTP_PROXY_DESTINATION` using a
ConfigMap, similarly to
xref:admin-guide-manage-pods-egress-router-configmap[the redirecting egress router example above].

[[admin-guide-manage-pods-egress-router-failover]]
==== Enabling Failover for Egress Router Pods

Using a replication controller, you can ensure that there is always one copy of the egress router pod in order to prevent downtime.

. Create a replication controller configuration file using the following:
+
====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: egress-demo-controller
spec:
  replicas: 1 <1>
  selector:
    name: egress-demo

endif::openshift-enterprise[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
        image: openshift/origin-pod
endif::openshift-origin[]
      nodeSelector:
        site: springfield-1
----
<1> Ensure `replicas` is set to `1`, because only one pod can be using a given
`EGRESS_SOURCE` value at any time. This means that only a single copy of the
router will be running, on a node with the label `site=springfield-1`.
====

. Create the pod using the definition:
+
----
$ oc create -f <replication_controller>.json
----

. To verify, check to see if the replication controller pod has been created:
+
----
oc describe rc <replication_controller>

[[admin-guide-limit-pod-access-iptables]]
=== Using iptables Rules to Limit Access to External Resources

Some cluster administrators may want to perform actions on outgoing
traffic that do not fit within the model of `EgressNetworkPolicy` or the
egress router. In some cases, this can be done by creating iptables
rules directly.

For example, you could create rules that log traffic to particular
destinations, or to prevent more than a certain number of outgoing
connections per second.

{product-title} does not provide a way to add custom iptables rules
automatically, but it does provide a place where such rules can be
added manually by the administrator. Each node, on startup, will
create an empty chain called `OPENSHIFT-ADMIN-OUTPUT-RULES` in the
`filter` table (assuming that the chain does not already exist). Any
rules added to that chain by an administrator will be applied to all
traffic going from a pod to a destination outside the cluster (and not
to any other traffic).

There are a few things to watch out for when using this functionality:

. It is up to you to ensure that rules get created on each node;
{product-title} does not provide any way to make that happen
automatically.

. The rules are not applied to traffic that exits the cluster via an
egress router, and they run after `EgressNetworkPolicy` rules are applied
(and so will not see traffic that is denied by an
`EgressNetworkPolicy`).

. The handling of connections from pods to nodes or pods to the master
is complicated, because nodes have both "external" IP addresses and
"internal" SDN IP addresses. Thus, some pod-to-node/master traffic may
pass through this chain, but other pod-to-node/master traffic may
bypass it.

[[admin-guide-networking-multicast]]
== Enabling Multicast

[IMPORTANT]
====
At this time, multicast is best used for low bandwidth coordination or service
discovery and not a high-bandwidth solution.
====

Multicast traffic between {product-title} pods is disabled by default. You can
enable Multicast on a per-project basis by setting an annotation on the
project's corresponding `netnamespace` object:

----
# oc annotate netnamespace <namespace> \
    netnamespace.network.openshift.io/multicast-enabled=true
----

Disable multicast by removing the annotation:

----
# oc annotate netnamespace <namespace> \
    netnamespace.network.openshift.io/multicast-enabled-
----

If you have
xref:../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#joining-project-networks[joined
networks together], you will need to enable Multicast in each projects'
`netnamespace` in order for it to take effect in any of the projects. To enable
Multicast in the `default` project, you must also enable it in all other
projects that have been
xref:../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#making-project-networks-global[made
global].

[NOTE]
====
Multicast global projects are not "global", but instead communicate with only
other global projects via Multicast, not with all projects in the cluster, as is
the case with unicast.
====

[[admin-guide-networking-networkpolicy]]
== Enabling NetworkPolicy

[IMPORTANT]
====
Enabling the Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` is a Technology Preview feature only.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to
upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide
feedback during the development process.

For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features support scope, see
https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.
endif::[]
====

Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` is not currently fully supported by {product-title},
and the *ovs-subnet* and *ovs-multitenant* plug-ins ignore `NetworkPolicy`
objects. However, a Technology Preview of `NetworkPolicy` support is available
by using the *ovs-networkpolicy* plug-in.

In a cluster
xref:../install_config/configuring_sdn.adoc#install-config-configuring-sdn[configured
to use the *ovs-networkpolicy* plug-in], network isolation is controlled
entirely by
link:https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/network/network-policy.md[`NetworkPolicy` objects]. By default, all pods in a project are accessible from other pods and network endpoints. To isolate
one or more pods in a project, you can create `NetworkPolicy` objects in that
project to indicate the allowed incoming connections. Project administrators can
create and delete `NetworkPolicy` objects within their own project.

Pods that do not have `NetworkPolicy` objects pointing to them are fully
accessible, whereas, pods that have one or more `NetworkPolicy` objects pointing
to them are isolated. These isolated pods only accept connections that are
accepted by at least one of their `NetworkPolicy` objects.

Following are a few sample `NetworkPolicy` object definitions supporting
different scenrios:

* *Deny All Traffic*
+
To make a project "deny by default" add a `NetworkPolicy` object that
matches all pods but accepts no traffic.
+
[source,yaml]
----
networkConfig:
 ...
  networkPluginName: "redhat/openshift-ovs-networkpolicy" <1>
 ...
----
<1> Set to *redhat/openshift-ovs-networkpolicy* for the *ovs-networkpolicy* plug-in

* *Only Accept connections from pods within project*
+
To make pods accept connections from other pods in the same project,
but reject all other connections from pods in other projects:
+
[source,yaml]
----
networkConfig:
  ...
  networkPluginName: "redhat/openshift-ovs-networkpolicy" <1>
----
<1> Set to *redhat/openshift-ovs-networkpolicy* for the *ovs-networkpolicy* plug-in

* *Only allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic based on pod labels*
+
To enable only HTTP and HTTPS access to the pods with a specific label
(`role=frontend` in following example), add a `NetworkPolicy` object similar to:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: allow-http-and-https
spec:
  podSelector:
  ingress:
  - ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 443
----

`NetworkPolicy` objects are additive, which means you can combine multiple
`NetworkPolicy` objects together to satisfy complex network requirements.

For example, for the `NetworkPolicy` objects defined in previous samples, you
can define both `allow-same-namespace` and `allow-http-and-https` policies
within the same project. Thus allowing the pods with the label `role=frontend`,
to accept any connection allowed by each policy. That is,  connections on any
port from pods in the *_same_* namespace, and connections on ports `80` and
`443` from pods in *_any_* namespace.

[[admin-guide-networking-networkpolicy-routers]]
=== NetworkPolicy and Routers

When using the *ovs-multitenant* plugin, traffic from
xref:../architecture/topics/routers.adoc[routers] is automatically allowed into all
namespaces (because the routers are normally in the "default" namespace, and all
namespaces allow connections from pods in that namespace). With the *ovs-networkpolicy*
plugin, this does not happen automatically, so if you have a policy that isolates a
namespace by default, you will need to take additional steps to allow routers to access
it.

One option is to create a policy for each service, allowing access from all sources. eg:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: allow-to-database-service
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: database
  ingress:
  - ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 5432
----

This will allow routers to access the service, but will allow pods in other users'
namespaces to access it as well. (In general, this should not be a problem though, since
those pods could normally just access the service via the public router anyway.)

Alternatively, you can create a policy allowing full access from the default namespace, as
in the *ovs-multitenant* plugin:

. First, a cluster administrator must add a label to the default namespace so it can be
matched:
+
----
$ oc label namespace default name=default
----
. Then project administrators can create policies allowing connections from that
namespace:
[source,yaml]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: allow-from-default-namespace
spec:
  podSelector:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: default
----

[[admin-guide-networking-networkpolicy-setting-default]]
=== Setting a Default NetworkPolicy for New Projects
Cluster administrators can modify the default project template to enable
automatic creation of default `NetworkPolicy` objects (one or more), whenever a
new project is created. To do this:

. Create a custom project template and configure the master to use it, as
described in
xref:../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#modifying-the-template-for-new-projects[Modifying the Template for New Projects].
. Edit the template to include the desired `NetworkPolicy` objects:
+
----
$ oc edit template project-request -n default
----
+
[NOTE]
====
To include `NetworkPolicy` objects into existing template, use the `oc edit`
command. Currently, it is not possible to use `oc patch` to add objects to a
`Template` resource.
====

.. Add each default policy as an element in the `objects` array:
+
[source,yaml]
----
objects:
...
- apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
  kind: NetworkPolicy
  metadata:
    name: allow-from-same-namespace
  spec:
    podSelector:
    ingress:
    - from:
      - podSelector: {}
- apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
  kind: NetworkPolicy
  metadata:
    name: allow-from-default-namespace
  spec:
    podSelector:
    ingress:
    - from:
      - namespaceSelector:
          matchLabels:
            name: default
...
----
