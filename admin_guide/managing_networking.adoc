== Overview

This topic describes the management of the overall xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/networking.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-networking[cluster network],
including project isolation and outbound traffic control.

Pod-level networking features, such as per-pod bandwidth limits, are discussed
in xref:../admin_guide/managing_pods.adoc#admin-guide-manage-pods[Managing
Pods].

[[joining-project-networks]]
=== Joining Project Networks

To join projects to an existing project network:

----
$ oadm pod-network join-projects --to=<project1> <project2> <project3>
----

In the above example, all the pods and services in `<project2>` and `<project3>`
can now access any pods and services in `<project1>` and vice versa. Services
can be accessed either by IP or fully-qualified DNS name
(`<service>.<pod_namespace>.svc.cluster.local`). For example, to access a
service named `db` in a project `myproject`, use `db.myproject.svc.cluster.local`.

Alternatively, instead of specifying specific project names, you can use the
`--selector=<project_selector>` option.

[[isolating-project-networks]]
== Isolating Project Networks

To isolate the project network in the cluster and vice versa, run:

----
$ oadm pod-network isolate-projects <project1> <project2>
----

In the above example, all of the pods and services in `<project1>` and
`<project2>` can _not_ access any pods and services from other non-global
projects in the cluster and vice versa.

Alternatively, instead of specifying specific project names, you can use the
`--selector=<project_selector>` option.

[[making-project-networks-global]]
=== Making Project Networks Global

To allow projects to access all pods and services in the cluster and vice versa:

----
$ oadm pod-network make-projects-global <project1> <project2>
----

In the above example, all the pods and services in `<project1>` and `<project2>`
can now access any pods and services in the cluster and vice versa.

Alternatively, instead of specifying specific project names, you can use the
`--selector=<project_selector>` option.

[[admin-guide-controlling-egress-traffic]]
== Controlling Egress Traffic

As a cluster administrator you can allocate a number of static IP addresses to a
specific node at the host level. If an application developer needs a dedicated
IP address for their application service, they can request one during the
process they use to ask for firewall access. They can then deploy an egress
router from the developer's project, using a `*nodeSelector*` in the deployment
configuration to ensure that the pod lands on the host with the pre-allocated
static IP address.

The egress pod's deployment declares one of the source IPs, the destination IP
of the protected service, and a gateway IP to reach the destination. After the
pod is deployed, you can
xref:../dev_guide/integrating_external_services.adoc#dev-guide-integrating-external-services[create
a service] to access the egress router pod, then add that source IP to the
corporate firewall. The developer then has access information to the egress
router service that was created in their project, for example,
`service.project.cluster.domainname.com`.

When the developer needs to access the external, firewalled service, they can
call out to the egress router pod's service
(`service.project.cluster.domainname.com`) in their application (for example,
the JDBC connection information) rather than the actual protected service URL.

As an {product-title} cluster administrator, you can control egress traffic in three ways:

xref:admin-guide-limit-pod-access-egress[Firewall]::
Using an egress firewall allows you to enforce the acceptable outbound traffic
policies, so that specific endpoints or IP ranges (subnets) are the only
acceptable targets for the dynamic endpoints (pods within {product-title}) to
talk to.

xref:admin-guide-limit-pod-access-egress-router[Router]::
Using an egress router allows you to create identifiable services to send
traffic to a specific destination, ensuring an external destination treats
traffic as though it were coming from a known source. This helps with security,
because it allows you to secure an external database so that only specific pods
in a namespace can talk to a service (the egress router), which proxies the
traffic to your database.


[[admin-guide-limit-pod-access-egress]]
=== Using an Egress Firewall to Limit Access to External Resources

As an {product-title} cluster administrator, you can use egress firewall policy
to limit the external addresses that some or all pods can access from within the
cluster, so that:

- A pod can only talk to internal hosts, and cannot initiate connections to the
public Internet.
+
Or,
- A pod can only talk to the public Internet, and cannot initiate connections to
internal hosts (outside the cluster).
+
Or,
- A pod cannot reach specified internal subnets/hosts that it should have no
reason to contact.

You can configure projects to have different egress policies. For example,
allowing `<project A>` access to a specified IP range, but denying the same
access to `<project B>`. Or restrict application developers from updating from
(Python) pip mirrors, and forcing updates to only come from desired sources.

[CAUTION]
====
You must have the
xref:../install_config/configuring_sdn.adoc#install-config-configuring-sdn[*ovs-multitenant* plug-in] enabled in order to limit pod access via egress policy.
====

Project administrators can neither create `EgressNetworkPolicy` objects, nor
edit the ones you create in their project. There are also several other
restrictions on where `EgressNetworkPolicy` can be created:

* The `default` project (and any other project that has been made global via
`oadm pod-network make-projects-global`) cannot have egress policy.

* If you merge two projects together (via `oadm pod-network join-projects`),
then you cannot use egress policy in _any_ of the joined projects.

* No project may have more than one egress policy object.

Violating any of these restrictions results in broken egress policy for the
project, and may cause all external network traffic to be dropped.

Use the `oc` command or the REST API to configure egress policy. You can use
`oc [create|replace|delete]` to manipulate `EgressNetworkPolicy` objects. The
*_api/swagger-spec/oapi-v1.json_* file has API-level details on how the objects
actually work.

To configure egress policy:

. Navigate to the project you want to affect.

. Create a JSON file with the desired policy details. For example:
+
----
{
    "kind": "EgressNetworkPolicy",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "default"
    },
    "spec": {
        "egress": [
            {
                "type": "Allow",
                "to": {
                    "cidrSelector": "1.2.3.0/24"
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "Allow",
                "to": {
                    "dnsName": "www.foo.com"
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "Deny",
                "to": {
                    "cidrSelector": "0.0.0.0/0"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
----
+
When the example above is added in a project, it allows traffic to IP range
`1.2.3.0/24` and domain name `www.foo.com`, but denies access to all other
external IP addresses. (Traffic to other pods is not affected because the policy
only applies to _external_ traffic.)
+
The rules in an `EgressNetworkPolicy` are checked in order, and the first one
that matches takes effect. If the three rules in the above example were
reversed, then traffic would not be allowed to `1.2.3.0/24` and `www.foo.com`
because the `0.0.0.0/0` rule would be checked first, and it would match and deny
all traffic.
+
Domain name updates are polled based on the TTL(time to live) value of the
domain, or 30 minutes if the TTL is not found. In the above example, suppose
`www.foo.com` resolved to `10.11.12.13` and has a DNS TTL of one minute, but was
later changed to `20.21.22.23`. {product-title} will then take up to one minute
if it is able to fetch the DNS TTL from an authoritative server for
`www.foo.com`. If fetching the DNS TTL value fails, then it will take up to 30
minutes to adapt to these DNS updates.

. Use the JSON file to create an EgressNetworkPolicy object:
+
----
# oc create -f <policy>.json
----

[[admin-guide-limit-pod-access-egress-router]]
=== Using an Egress Router to Allow External Resources to Recognize Pod Traffic

The {product-title} egress router runs a service that redirects traffic to a
specified remote server, using a private source IP address that is not used for
anything else. The service allows pods to talk to servers that are set up
to only allow access from whitelisted IP addresses.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The egress router is not intended for every outgoing connection. Creating large
numbers of egress routers can push the limits of your network hardware. For
example, creating an egress router for every project or application could exceed
the number of local MAC addresses that the network interface can handle before
falling back to filtering MAC addresses in software.
====

[[admin-guide-limit-pod-access-important-deployment-considerations]]
==== Important Deployment Considerations

The Egress router adds a second IP address and MAC address to the node's primary
network interface. If you are not running {product-title} on bare metal, you may
need to configure your hypervisor or cloud provider to allow the additional
address.

*Red Hat OpenStack Platform*

If you are deploying {product-title} on Red Hat OpenStack Platform, you need to
whitelist the IP and MAC addresses on your Openstack environment, otherwise

==== Deploying an Egress Router Pod

. Create a pod configuration using the following:
+
.Example Pod Definition for an Egress Router
====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: egress-1
  labels:
    name: egress-1
  annotations:
    pod.network.openshift.io/assign-macvlan: "true" <1>
spec:
  containers:
  - name: egress-router
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
    image: registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-egress-router
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
    image: openshift/origin-egress-router
endif::openshift-origin[]
    securityContext:
      privileged: true
    env:
    - name: EGRESS_SOURCE <2>
      value: 192.168.12.99
    - name: EGRESS_GATEWAY <3>
      value: 192.168.12.1
    - name: EGRESS_DESTINATION <4>
      value: 203.0.113.25
  nodeSelector:
    site: springfield-1 <5>
----
<1> The `pod.network.openshift.io/assign-macvlan annotation` creates a Macvlan
network interface on the primary network interface, and then moves it into the
pod's network name space before starting the *egress-router* container. Preserve
the the quotation marks around `"true"`. Omitting them will result in errors.
<2> An IP address from the physical network that the node itself is on and is
reserved by the cluster administrator for use by this pod.
<3> Same value as the default gateway used by the node itself.
<4> The external server that to direct traffic to. Using this example,
connections to the pod are redirected to 203.0.113.25, with a source IP address
of 192.168.12.99.
<5> The pod will only be deployed to nodes with the label `site=springfield-1`.
====

. Create the pod using the above definition:
+
----
$ oc create -f <pod_name>.json
----
+
To check to see if the pod has been created:
+
----
oc get pod <pod_name>
----

. Ensure other pods can find the pod's IP address by creating a service to point to the egress router:
+
====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: egress-1
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
  - name: https
    port: 443
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    name: egress-1
----
====
+
Your pods can now connect to this service. Their connections are redirected to
the corresponding ports on the external server, using the reserved egress IP
address.

The pod contains a single container, using the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*openshift3/ose-egress-router*
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*openshift/origin-egress-router*
endif::openshift-origin[]
image, and that container is run privileged so that it can configure the Macvlan
interface and set up `iptables` rules.

The environment variables tell the *egress-router* image what addresses to use; it
will configure the Macvlan interface to use `EGRESS_SOURCE` as its IP address,
with `EGRESS_GATEWAY` as its gateway.

NAT rules are set up so that connections to any TCP or UDP port on the
pod's cluster IP address are redirected to the same port on
`EGRESS_DESTINATION`.

If only some of the nodes in your cluster are capable of claiming the specified
source IP address and using the specified gateway, you can specify a
`nodeName` or `nodeSelector` indicating which nodes are acceptable.

[[admin-guide-manage-pods-egress-router-failover]]
==== Enabling Failover for Egress Router Pods

Using a replication controller, you can ensure that there is always one copy of the egress router pod in order to prevent downtime.

. Create a replication controller configuration file using the following:
+
====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: egress-demo-controller
spec:
  replicas: 1 <1>
  selector:
    name: egress-demo
  template:
    metadata:
      name: egress-demo
      labels:
        name: egress-demo
      annotations:
        pod.network.openshift.io/assign-macvlan: "true"
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: egress-demo-container
        image: openshift/origin-egress-router
        env:
        - name: EGRESS_SOURCE
          value: 192.168.12.99
        - name: EGRESS_GATEWAY
          value: 192.168.12.1
        - name: EGRESS_DESTINATION
          value: 203.0.113.25
        securityContext:
          privileged: true
      nodeSelector:
        site: springfield-1
----
<1> Ensure `replicas` is set to `1`, because only one pod can be using a given
`EGRESS_SOURCE` value at any time. This means that only a single copy of the
router will be running, on a node with the label `site=springfield-1`.
====

. Create the pod using the definition:
+
----
$ oc create -f <replication_controller>.json
----

. To verify, check to see if the replication controller pod has been created:
+
----
oc describe rc <replication_controller>
----

[[admin-guide-networking-multicast]]
== Enabling Multicast

[IMPORTANT]
====
Enabling multicast networking is a Technology Preview feature only.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to
upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide
feedback during the development process.

For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features support scope, see
https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.
endif::[]
====

Multicast traffic between {product-title} pods is disabled by default. You can
enable Multicast on a per-project basis by setting an annotation on the
project's corresponding `netnamespace` object:

----
# oc annotate netnamespace <namespace> \
    netnamespace.network.openshift.io/multicast-enabled=true
----

Disable multicast by removing the annotation:

----
# oc annotate netnamespace <namespace> \
    netnamespace.network.openshift.io/multicast-enabled-
----

If you have
xref:../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#joining-project-networks[joined
networks together], you will need to enable Multicast in each projects'
`netnamespace` in order for it to take effect in any of the projects. To enable
Multicast in the `default` project, you must also enable it in all other
projects that have been
xref:../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#making-project-networks-global[made
global].

[NOTE]
====
Multicast global projects are not "global", but instead communicate with only
other global projects via Multicast, not with all projects in the cluster, as is
the case with unicast.

[[admin-guide-networking-networkpolicy]]
== Enabling NetworkPolicy

[IMPORTANT]
====
Enabling the Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` is a Technology Preview feature only.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to
upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide
feedback during the development process.

====

Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` is not currently fully supported by {product-title},
and the *ovs-subnet* and *ovs-multitenant* plug-ins ignore `NetworkPolicy`
objects. However, a Technology Preview of `NetworkPolicy` support is available by
using the *ovs-networkpolicy* plug-in.

In a cluster
xref:../install_config/configuring_sdn.adoc#install-config-configuring-sdn[configured
to use the *ovs-networkpolicy* plug-in], network isolation is controlled
entirely by `NetworkPolicy` objects and the link:https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/network-policy.md[associated Namespace annotation]. In particular, by default, all projects are able to access pods
in all other projects. The project to be isolated must first be configured to
opt in to isolation by setting the proper annotation on its Namespace object,
and then creating `NetworkPolicy` objects indicating the incoming connections to
be allowed.
