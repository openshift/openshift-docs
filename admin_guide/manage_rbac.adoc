== Overview

You can use xref:../cli_reference/index.adoc#cli-reference-index[the CLI] to
view
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authorization[RBAC
resources] and the administrator CLI to manage the
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authorization[roles
and bindings].

ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
Dedicated administrators can view but not manage cluster roles.  They can manage cluster role bindings
and manage local roles and bindings.

[[viewing-roles-and-bindings]]
== Viewing Roles and Bindings

xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[Roles] can be used to grant
various levels of access both
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#cluster-and-local-rbac[cluster-wide]
as well as at the
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#cluster-and-local-rbac[project-scope].
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.adoc#users-and-groups[Users
and groups] can be associated with, or _bound_ to, multiple roles at the same
time.  You can view details about the roles and their bindings using the `oc
describe` command.

ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
Users with the *dedicated-cluster-admin* role can view but not manage cluster roles.  They can manage cluster
role bindings and manage local roles and bindings.  Users with the *admin*
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[default cluster role]
bound locally can manage roles and bindings in that project.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
Users with the *cluster-admin*
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[default cluster role]
bound cluster-wide can perform any action on any resource. Users with the
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[*admin* default cluster role]
bound locally can manage roles and bindings in that project.

=== Viewing Local Roles and Bindings

All of the
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[default
cluster roles] can be bound locally to users or groups.
xref:creating-local-role[Custom local roles] can be created. The local role
bindings are also viewable.

To view the current set of local role bindings, which show the users and groups
that are bound to various roles:

----
$ oc describe rolebinding.rbac
----

By default, the current project is used when viewing local role bindings.
Alternatively, a project can be specified with the `-n` flag. This is useful for
viewing the local role bindings of another project, if the user already has the
*admin*
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[default
cluster role] in it.

== Managing Role Bindings

Adding, or _binding_, a
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[role] to
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.adoc#users-and-groups[users
or groups] gives the user or group the relevant access granted by the role. You
can add and remove roles to and from users and groups using `oc adm policy`
commands.

When managing a user or group's associated roles for local role bindings using the
following operations, a project may be specified with the `-n` flag. If it is
not specified, then the current project is used.

.Local Role Binding Operations
[options="header"]
|===

|Command |Description

|`$ oc adm policy who-can _<verb>_ _<resource>_`
|Indicates which users can perform an action on a resource.

|`$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user _<role>_ _<username>_`
|Binds a given role to specified users in the current project.

|`$ oc adm policy remove-role-from-user _<role>_ _<username>_`
|Removes a given role from specified users in the current project.

|`$ oc adm policy remove-user _<username>_`
|Removes specified users and all of their roles in the current project.

|`$ oc adm policy add-role-to-group _<role>_ _<groupname>_`
|Binds a given role to specified groups in the current project.

|`$ oc adm policy remove-role-from-group _<role>_ _<groupname>_`
|Removes a given role from specified groups in the current project.

|`$ oc adm policy remove-group _<groupname>_`
|Removes specified groups and all of their roles in the current project.

|===

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]

You can also manage cluster role bindings using the following
operations. The `-n` flag is not used for these operations because
cluster role bindings uses non-namespaced resources.

.Cluster Role Binding Operations
[options="header"]
|===

|Command |Description

|`$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user _<role>_ _<username>_`
|Binds a given role to specified users for all projects in the cluster.

|`$ oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-user _<role>_ _<username>_`
|Removes a given role from specified users for all projects in the cluster.

|`$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-group _<role>_ _<groupname>_`
|Binds a given role to specified groups for all projects in the cluster.

|`$ oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-group _<role>_ _<groupname>_`
|Removes a given role from specified groups for all projects in the cluster.

For example, you can add the *admin* role to the *alice* user in *joe-project*
by running:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user admin alice -n joe-project
----


You can then view the local role bindings and verify the addition in the output:

[[creating-local-role]]
== Creating a Local Role

To create a local role for a project, run the following command:

----
$ oc create role ...
----

The following excerpt from the help of this command describes its usage:

----
Create a role with single rule.

Usage:
  oc create role NAME --verb=verb --resource=resource.group/subresource [--resource-name=resourcename] [--dry-run] [options]

Examples:
  # Create a Role named "pod-reader" that allows user to perform "get", "watch" and "list" on pods
  oc create role pod-reader --verb=get --verb=list --verb=watch --resource=pods

  # Create a Role named "pod-reader" with ResourceName specified
  oc create role pod-reader --verb=get,list,watch --resource=pods --resource-name=readablepod --resource-name=anotherpod

  # Create a Role named "foo" with API Group specified
  oc create role foo --verb=get,list,watch --resource=rs.extensions

  # Create a Role named "foo" with SubResource specified
  oc create role foo --verb=get,list,watch --resource=pods,pods/status

Options:
      --dry-run=false: If true, only print the object that would be sent, without sending it.
      --resource=[]: resource that the rule applies to
      --resource-name=[]: resource in the white list that the rule applies to, repeat this flag for multiple items
      --verb=[]: verb that applies to the resources contained in the rule

For example, to create a role that allows a user to view pods, run:

----
$ oc create role podview --verb=get --resource=pod -n bob-project
----

Optionally, annotate it with a description.

To bind the new role to a user, run:

----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user podview user2 --role-namespace=bob-project -n bob-project

== Cluster and Local Role Bindings

A cluster role binding is a binding that exists at the cluster level.
A role binding exists at the project level. The cluster role _view_ must be
bound to a user using a local role binding for that user to view the project.
Local roles should only created if a cluster role does not provide the set
of permissions needed for a particular situation.

Some cluster role names are initially confusing. The cluster role
`clusteradmin` can be bound to a user using a local role binding, making it appear
that this user has the privileges of a cluster administrator. This is not the case.
The `clusteradmin` cluster role bound to a certain project is more like a super
administrator for that project, granting the permissions of the cluster role
`admin`, plus a few additional permissions like the ability to edit rate limits.
This can appear especially confusing via the web console UI, which does not list
cluster role bindings (which are bound to true cluster administrators). However, it
does list local role bindings (which could be used to locally bind `clusteradmin`).
