== Overview

You can use xref:../cli_reference/index.adoc#cli-reference-index[the CLI] to
view
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authorization[RBAC
resources] and the administrator CLI to manage the
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authorization[roles
and bindings].

ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-aro[]
{cluster-admin-name}s can view but not manage cluster roles. They can manage cluster role bindings
and manage local roles and bindings.

== Viewing roles and bindings

xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[Roles] can be used to grant
various levels of access both
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#cluster-and-local-rbac[cluster-wide]
as well as at the
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#cluster-and-local-rbac[project-scope].
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.adoc#users-and-groups[Users
and groups] can be associated with, or _bound_ to, multiple roles at the same
time. You can view details about the roles and their bindings using the `oc
describe` command.

ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-aro[]
Users with the *{cluster-admin-role}* role can view but not manage cluster roles. They can manage cluster
role bindings and manage local roles and bindings. Users with the *admin*
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[default cluster role]
bound locally can manage roles and bindings in that project.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
Users with the *cluster-admin*
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[default cluster role]
bound cluster-wide can perform any action on any resource. Users with the
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[*admin* default cluster role]
bound locally can manage roles and bindings in that project.

=== Viewing local roles and bindings

All of the
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[default
cluster roles] can be bound locally to users or groups.
xref:creating-local-role[Custom local roles] can be created. The local role
bindings are also viewable.

To view the current set of local role bindings, which show the users and groups
that are bound to various roles:

----
$ oc describe rolebinding.rbac
----

By default, the current project is used when viewing local role bindings.
Alternatively, a project can be specified with the `-n` flag. This is useful for
viewing the local role bindings of another project, if the user already has the
*admin*
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[default
cluster role] in it.

[[managing-role-bindings]]
== Managing role bindings

Adding, or _binding_, a
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[role] to
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.adoc#users-and-groups[users
or groups] gives the user or group the relevant access granted by the role. You
can add and remove roles to and from users and groups using `oc adm policy`
commands.

When managing a user or group's associated roles for local role bindings using the
following operations, a project may be specified with the `-n` flag. If it is
not specified, then the current project is used.

.Local role binding operations
[options="header"]
|===

|Command |Description

|`$ oc adm policy who-can _<verb>_ _<resource>_`
|Indicates which users can perform an action on a resource.

|`$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user _<role>_ _<username>_`
|Binds a given role to specified users in the current project.

|`$ oc adm policy remove-role-from-user _<role>_ _<username>_`
|Removes a given role from specified users in the current project.

|`$ oc adm policy remove-user _<username>_`
|Removes customer-admin-cluster role from specified users in the current project.

|`$ oc adm policy add-role-to-group _<role>_ _<groupname>_`
|Binds a given role to specified groups in the current project.

|`$ oc adm policy remove-role-from-group _<role>_ _<groupname>_`
|Removes a given role from specified groups in the current project.

|`$ oc adm policy remove-group _<groupname>_`
|Removes customer-admin-cluster role from specified groups in the current project.

|`--rolebinding-name=`
|Can be used with `oc adm policy` commands to assign a custom rolebinding name to a user or group.

|===

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]

You can also manage cluster role bindings using the following
operations. The `-n` flag is not used for these operations because
cluster role bindings use non-namespaced resources.

.Cluster role binding operations
[options="header"]
|===

|Command |Description

|`$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user _<role>_ _<username>_`
|Binds a given role to specified users for all projects in the cluster.

|`$ oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-user _<role>_ _<username>_`
|Removes a given role from specified users for all projects in the cluster.

|`$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-group _<role>_ _<groupname>_`
|Binds a given role to specified groups for all projects in the cluster.

|`$ oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-group _<role>_ _<groupname>_`
|Removes a given role from specified groups for all projects in the cluster.

|`--rolebinding-name=`
|Can be used with `oc adm policy` commands to assign a custom rolebinding name to a user or group.

For example, you can add the *admin* role to the *alice* user in *joe-project*
by running:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user admin alice -n joe-project

You can then view the local role bindings and verify the addition in the output:

$ oc create role <name> --verb=<verb> --resource=<resource> -n <project>
----
+
In this command, specify:
* `<name>`, the local role's name
* `<verb>`, a comma-separated list of the verbs to apply to the role
* `<resource>`, the resources that the role applies to
* `<project>`, the project name
+
For example, to create a local role that allows a user to view pods in the
`blue` project, run the following command:
+
----
$ oc create role podview --verb=get --resource=pod -n blue
----

. To bind the new role to a user, run the following command:

----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user podview user2 --role-namespace=blue -n blue

== Creating a cluster role

To create a cluster role, run the following command:

----
$ oc create clusterrole <name> --verb=<verb> --resource=<resource>
----

In this command, specify:

* `<name>`, the local role's name
* `<verb>`, a comma-separated list of the verbs to apply to the role
* `<resource>`, the resources that the role applies to

For example, to create a cluster role that allows a user to view pods, run the
following command:

----
$ oc create clusterrole podviewonly --verb=get --resource=pod
----

[[cluster-and-local-role-bindings]]
== Cluster and local role bindings

A cluster role binding is a binding that exists at the cluster level.
A role binding exists at the project level. The cluster role _view_ must be
bound to a user using a local role binding for that user to view the project.
Create local roles only if a cluster role does not provide the set
of permissions needed for a particular situation.

Some cluster role names are initially confusing. You can bind the `cluster-admin`
to a user, using a local role binding, making it appear that this user has the
privileges of a cluster administrator. This is not the case. Binding the `cluster-admin`
to a certain project is more like a super administrator for that
project, granting the permissions of the cluster role
`admin`, plus a few additional permissions like the ability to edit rate limits.
This can appear confusing especially via the web console UI, which does not list
cluster role bindings that are bound to true cluster administrators. However, it
does list local role bindings that you can use to locally bind `cluster-admin`.

[[updating-policy-definitions]]
== Updating Policy Definitions

During a cluster upgrade, and on every restart of any master, the
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[default
cluster roles] are automatically reconciled to restore any missing permissions.

If you customized default cluster roles and want to ensure a role reconciliation
does not modify them:

. Protect each role from reconciliation:
+
----
$ oc annotate clusterrole.rbac <role_name> --overwrite rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate=false
----
+
[WARNING]
====
You must manually update the roles that contain this setting to include any new
or required permissions after upgrading.
====

. Generate a default bootstrap policy template file:
+
----
$ oc adm create-bootstrap-policy-file --filename=policy.json
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The contents of the file vary based on the {product-title} version, but the file
contains only the default policies.
====

. Update the *_policy.json_* file to include any cluster role customizations.

. Use the policy file to automatically reconcile roles and role bindings that
are not reconcile protected:
+
----
$ oc auth reconcile -f policy.json
----

. Reconcile security context constraints:
+
----
# oc adm policy reconcile-sccs \
    --additive-only=true \
    --confirm
----
