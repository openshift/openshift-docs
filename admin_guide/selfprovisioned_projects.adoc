== Overview
You can allow developers to create their own projects. An accessible endpoint
exists that will provision a project according to a
link:../dev_guide/templates.html[template]. This endpoint is made accessible
when a developer link:../dev_guide/projects.html[creates a new project].

== Template for New Projects
The API server automatically provisions projects based on the template that is
defined in the `projectRequestTemplate` parameter of the *_master-config.yaml_*
file. If the parameter is not defined, the API server creates a default template
that creates a project with the requested name, and assigns the requesting user
to the "admin" role for that project.

To create your own custom project template:

. Start with the current default project template:
+
----
$ oadm create-bootstrap-project-template -o yaml > template.yaml
----

. Modify the template by adding objects or modifying existing objects, then load the template:
+
----
$ oc create -f template.yaml -n default
----

. Modify the *_master-config.yaml_* file to reference the loaded template:
+
====
----
...
projectConfig:
  projectRequestTemplate: "default/project-request"
  ...
----
====

When a project request is submitted, the API substitutes the following parameters into the template:

[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|*PROJECT_NAME*
|The name of the project. Required.

|*PROJECT_DISPLAYNAME*
|The display name of the project. May be empty.

|*PROJECT_DESCRIPTION*
|The description of the project. May be empty.

|*PROJECT_ADMIN_USER*
|The username of the requesting user.
|===

Access to the API is granted to developers with the
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[`self-provisioner`
role] and the `self-provisioners` cluster role binding. This role is available
to all authenticated developers by default.

== Disabling Self-provisioning
Deleting the `self-provisioners`
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[cluster role
binding] will deny permissions for self-provisioning any new projects. When
disabling self-provisioning, set the `projectRequestMessage` parameter in the
*_master-config.yaml_* file instructing developers on how to request a new
project. This parameter is a string that will be presented to the developer in
the web console and command line when they attempt to self-provision a project.
For example:

----
Contact your system administrator at projectname@example.com to request a project.
----

or:

----
To request a new project, fill out the project request form located at
https://internal.example.com/openshift-project-request.
----
