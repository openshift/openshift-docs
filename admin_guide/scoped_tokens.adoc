== Overview
A user may wish to give another entity the power to act as him, but only in a limited way.
For example, a project admin may wish to delegate the power to create pods.  One way to do 
this is to create a scoped token.

A scoped token, is a token that identifies as a given user, but is limited to certain actions 
by its scope.  Right now, only a cluster-admin can create scoped tokens.


== Evaluation
Scopes are evaluated by converting the set of scopes for a token into a set of PolicyRules.
The request is then matched against those rules.  The request attributes must match at least 
one of the scope rules to be passed to the "normal" authorizer for further authorization checks.


== Scopes
=== User Scopes
User scopes are focused on getting information about a given user.  They are intent-based, so
the rules are automatically created for you.

 1. `user:info` - Allows access to information the user: name, groups, etc.
 2. `user:check-access` - Allows access to self-localsubjectaccessreviews and self-subjectaccessreviews.
    Those are the variants where you pass an empty user and groups in your request object.

=== Role Scope
The role scope is about having the same level of access as a given role filtered by namespace.

 1. `role:<cluster-role name>:<namespace or * for all>` - Limits the scope to the rules specified
    by the cluster-role, but only in the namespace specified.

    Caveat: This prevents escalating access.  Even if the role allows access to resources like
    secrets, rolebindings, and roles, this scope will *deny* access to those resources.  This helps
    prevent unexpected escalations.  Many people do not think of a role like `edit` as being an escalating
    role, but with access to a `secret`, it is.

 1.  `role:<cluster-role name>:<namespace or * for all>:!` - Note the bang.  This is like #1, except that it
     *does* allow escalating access.
