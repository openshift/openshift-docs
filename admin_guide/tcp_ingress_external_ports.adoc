== Overview

One approach to getting
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/getting_traffic_into_cluster.adoc#traffic-overview[external traffic into the cluster]
is by using ExternalIP or IngressIP addresses.

[NOTE]
====
This feature is only supported in non-cloud deployments. For cloud (GCE, AWS, and OpenStack) deployments,
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/getting_traffic_into_cluster.adoc#using-the-loadbalancer[load
Balancer] services can be used to automatically deploy a cloud load balancer to target the service's endpoints.
====

{product-title} supports two pools of IP addresses, IngressIP and ExternalIP, that provide
external access to the cluster. IngressIP is uses by the Loadbalancer when chosing an
external IP address for the service. ExternalIP is used when the user selects a specific IP
from the configured pool.

In either case, if routed correctly, external traffic can reach that service's endpoints via
any TCP/UDP port the service exposes. This can be simpler than having to manage the port
space of a limited number of shared IP addresses when manually assigning external IPs to
services. Also, these addresses can be used as virtual IPs (VIPs) when configuring
xref:high_availability.adoc#configuring-ip-failover[high availability].

There is support for both automatic and manual assignment of IP addresses, and each address
is guaranteed to be assigned to a maximum of one service. This ensures that each service can
simply expose its chosen ports regardless of the ports exposed by other services.

[[unique-external-ips-ingress-traffic-restrictions]]
== Restrictions

To use an *ExternalIP*, you can:

- Select an IP address from the
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-node-config-network-config[*ExternalIPNetworkCIDRs*]
in the xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#[/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml] file.
range.
- Have an IP address assigned from the
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-node-config-network-config[*IngressIPNetworkCIDR*]
pool in the xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#[/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml] file.
.Sample xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-node-config-network-config[*servicesNodePortRange*] xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#[/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml]
pool. In this case, {product-title} implements a non-cloud version of the LoadBalancer service type and assigns IP addresses to the services.
+
[CAUTION]
====
You must ensure that the IP address pool you assign terminates at one or more nodes in your cluster. You can use the existing
xref:high_availability.adoc#configuring-ip-failover[`*oadm ipfailover*`] to ensure that the external IPs are
xref:high_availability.adoc#configuring-ip-failover[highly available].
====

For manually-configured external IPs, potential port clashes are handled on a first-come, first-served basis. If you request a port, it is only available if it has not yet been assigned for that IP address. For example:

.Port clash example for manually-configured external IPs
====
Two services have been manually configured with the same external
IP address of 172.7.7.7.

----
`MongoDB service A` requests port 27017, and then
`MongoDB service B` requests the same port; the first request gets the port.
----
====

However, port clashes are not an issue for external IPs assigned by the ingress controller, because the controller assigns each service a unique address.

[NOTE]
====
Ingress IPs can only be assigned if the cluster is not running in the cloud. In cloud environments, LoadBalancer-type services configure cloud-specific load balancers.

== Configuring the Cluster to Use Unique External IPs

In non-cloud clusters,
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-node-config-network-config[`IngressIPNetworkCIDR`]
is set by default to `172.29.0.0/16`. If your cluster environment is not already
using this private range, you can use the default. However, if you want to use a
different range, then you must set
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-node-config-network-config[`IngressIPNetworkCIDR`]
in the xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#[*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*]
file before you assign an ingress IP. Then, restart the master service.

[CAUTION]
====
External IPs assigned to services of type `LoadBalancer` will always be in the
range of `IngressIPNetworkCIDR`. If `IngressIPNetworkCIDR` is changed such that
the assigned external IPs are no longer in range, the affected services will be
assigned new external IPs compatible with the new range.
====

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
[NOTE]
====
If you are using xref:high_availability.adoc#admin-guide-high-availability[high availibility]
, then this range must be less than 255 addresses.

=== Configuring an Ingress IP for a Service

To assign an ingress IP:

. Create a YAML file for a LoadBalancer service that requests a specific IP via the `*loadBalancerIP*` setting:
+
.Sample LoadBalancer Configuration
====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: egress-1
spec:
  ports:
  - name: db
    port: 3306
  loadBalancerIP: 172.29.0.1
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    name: my-db-selector
----
====
. Create a LoadBalancer service on your pod:
+
----
$ oc create -f loadbalancer.yaml
----
. Check the service for an external IP. For example, for a service named `myservice`:
+
----
$ oc get svc myservice
----
+
When your LoadBalancer-type service has an external IP assigned, the output
displays the IP:
+
----
NAME         CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
myservice    172.30.74.106   172.29.0.1    3306/TCP    30s
----

[[unique-external-ips-ingress-traffic-routing-cidr]]
== Routing the Ingress CIDR for Development or Testing

Add a static route directing traffic for the ingress CIDR to a node in the
cluster. For example:

----
# route add -net 172.29.0.0/16 gw 10.66.140.17 eth0
----

In the example above, `172.29.0.0/16` is the `*IngressIPNetworkCIDR*`, and `10.66.140.17` is the node IP.

== Service externalIPs

In addition to the cluster's internal IP addresses, the user can configure IP addresses
that are
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/getting_traffic_into_cluster.adoc#traffic-overview[external to the cluster]
. The administrator is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrives at a node with this IP.

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
The externalIPs must be selected by the admin from the
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-node-config-network-config[*ExternalIPNetworkCIDRs*]
range configured in
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#[*_master-config.yaml_*]
file. When *_master-config.yaml_* is changed, the master service must be
restarted.
