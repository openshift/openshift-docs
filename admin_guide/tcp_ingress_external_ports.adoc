== Overview

One approach to getting
xref:../dev_guide/getting_traffic_into_cluster.adoc#getting-traffic-into-cluster[external
traffic into the cluster] is by using ExternalIP or IngressIP addresses.

[NOTE]
====
This feature is only supported in non-cloud deployments. For cloud (GCE, AWS, and OpenStack) deployments,
xref:../dev_guide/getting_traffic_into_cluster.adoc#using-the-loadbalancer[load
Balancer] services can be used to automatically deploy a cloud load balancer to target the service's endpoints.
====

{product-title} supports two pools of IP addresses:

* IngressIP uses by the Loadbalancer when choosing an external IP address for the service. 
* ExternalIP is used when the user selects a specific IP from the configured
 pool.

[NOTE]
====
Both have to be configured to a device on an {product-title} host to be used,
whether with network interface controller (NIC) or virtual ethernet, as well as
external routing. Ipfailover is recommended for this, because it selects the
host and configures the NIC.
====

IngressIP and ExternalIP both allow external traffic access to the cluster, and,
if routed correctly, external traffic can reach that service's endpoints via any
TCP/UDP port the service exposes. This can be simpler than having to manage the
port space of a limited number of shared IP addresses when manually assigning
external IPs to services. Also, these addresses can be used as virtual IPs
(VIPs) when configuring
xref:../admin_guide/high_availability.adoc#configuring-ip-failover[high
availability].

{product-title} supports both the automatic and manual assignment of IP
addresses, and each address is guaranteed to be assigned to a maximum of one
service. This ensures that each service can expose its chosen ports regardless
of the ports exposed by other services.

[[unique-external-ips-ingress-traffic-restrictions]]
== Restrictions

To use an *ExternalIP*, you can:

- Select an IP address from the xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-node-config-network-config[`externalIPNetworkCIDRs`] range.
- Have an IP address assigned from the
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-node-config-network-config[`ingressIPNetworkCIDR`]
pool in the master configuration file. In this case, {product-title} implements a non-cloud version of the load balancer service type and assigns IP addresses to the services.
+
[CAUTION]
====
You must ensure that the IP address pool you assign terminates at one or more nodes in your cluster. You can use the existing
xref:../admin_guide/high_availability.adoc#configuring-ip-failover[`*oadm ipfailover*`] to ensure that the external IPs are highly available.
====

For manually-configured external IPs, potential port clashes are handled on a first-come, first-served basis. If you request a port, it is only available if it has not yet been assigned for that IP address. For example:

.Port clash example for manually-configured external IPs
====
Two services have been manually configured with the same external
IP address of 172.7.7.7.

`MongoDB service A` requests port 27017, and then
`MongoDB service B` requests the same port; the first request gets the port.
====

However, port clashes are not an issue for external IPs assigned by the ingress controller, because the controller assigns each service a unique address.

[NOTE]
====
Ingress IPs can only be assigned if the cluster is not running in the cloud. In cloud environments, LoadBalancer-type services configure cloud-specific load balancers.

== Configuring the Cluster to Use Unique External IPs

In non-cloud clusters, `ingressIPNetworkCIDR` is set by default to
`172.29.0.0/16`. If your cluster environment is not already using this private
range, you can use the default. However, if you want to use a different range,
then you must set
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-node-config-network-config[`ingressIPNetworkCIDR`]
in the *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file before you assign an
ingress IP. Then, restart the master service.

[CAUTION]
====
External IPs assigned to services of type `LoadBalancer` will always be in the
range of `ingressIPNetworkCIDR`. If `ingressIPNetworkCIDR` is changed such that
the assigned external IPs are no longer in range, the affected services will be
assigned new external IPs compatible with the new range.
====

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
[NOTE]
====
If you are using xref:../admin_guide/high_availability.adoc#admin-guide-high-availability[high availibility], then this range must be less than 255 IP addresses.

=== Configuring an Ingress IP for a Service

To assign an ingress IP:

. Create a YAML file for a LoadBalancer service that requests a specific IP via the `*loadBalancerIP*` setting:
+
.Sample LoadBalancer Configuration
====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: egress-1
spec:
  ports:
  - name: db
    port: 3306
  loadBalancerIP: 172.29.0.1
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    name: my-db-selector
----
====
. Create a LoadBalancer service on your pod:
+
----
$ oc create -f loadbalancer.yaml
----
. Check the service for an external IP. For example, for a service named `myservice`:
+
----
$ oc get svc myservice
----
+
When your LoadBalancer-type service has an external IP assigned, the output
displays the IP:
+
----
NAME         CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
myservice    172.30.74.106   172.29.0.1    3306/TCP    30s
----

[[unique-external-ips-ingress-traffic-routing-cidr]]
== Routing the Ingress CIDR for Development or Testing

Add a static route directing traffic for the ingress CIDR to a node in the
cluster. For example:

----
# route add -net 172.29.0.0/16 gw 10.66.140.17 eth0
----

In the example above, `172.29.0.0/16` is the `*ingressIPNetworkCIDR*`, and `10.66.140.17` is the node IP.

[[service-externalip]]
=== Service externalIPs

In addition to the cluster's internal IP addresses, the application developer
can configure IP addresses that are external to the cluster. As the
{product-title} administrator, you are responsible for ensuring that traffic
arrives at a node with this IP.

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
The externalIPs must be selected by the administrator from the
*externalIPNetworkCIDRs* range configured in the
xref:../admin_guide/tcp_ingress_external_ports.adoc#unique-external-ips-ingress-traffic-configure-cluster[*_master-config.yaml_*]
file. When *_master-config.yaml_* changes, the master service must be restarted.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-online[]
The externalIPs must be selected by the administrator from the
*externalIPNetworkCIDRs* range configured in master configuration file.
