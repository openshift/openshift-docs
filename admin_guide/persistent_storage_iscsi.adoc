== Overview
You can provision your OpenShift cluster with
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html[persistent storage] using
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Storage_Administration_Guide/ch25.html[iSCSI].
Some familiarity with Kubernetes and iSCSI is assumed.

The Kubernetes link:../dev_guide/persistent_volumes.html[persistent volume]
framework allows administrators to provision a cluster with persistent storage
and gives users a way to request those resources without having any knowledge of
the underlying infrastructure.

[IMPORTANT]
====
High-availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.

[[provisioning]]

== Provisioning
Storage must exist in the underlying infrastructure before it can be mounted as
a volume in OpenShift. All that is required for iSCSI is
iSCSI target portal, valid iSCSI IQN, valid LUN number, and filesystem type, and the `*PersistentVolume*` API.

[[enforcing-disk-quotas]]

=== Enforcing Disk Quotas
Use LUN partitions to enforce disk quotas and size constraints. Each LUN is one persistent volume. Kubernetes enforces
unique names for persistent volumes.

Enforcing quotas in this way allows the end user to request persistent storage
by a specific amount (e.g, 10Gi) and be matched with a corresponding volume of
equal or greater capacity.

[[volume-security]]

=== Volume Security
Users request storage with a `*PersistentVolumeClaim*`. This claim only lives in
the user's namespace and can only be referenced by a pod within that same
namespace. Any attempt to access a persistent volume across a namespace causes
the pod to fail.

Each iSCSI LUN must be accessible by all nodes in the cluster.
