== Overview

This topic describes the management of
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#pods[pods], including
limiting their run-once duration, and how much bandwidth they can use.

[[viewing-pods]]
== Viewing Pods

You can display usage statistics about pods, which provide the runtime
environments for containers. These usage statistics include CPU, memory, and
storage consumption.

To view the usage statistics:

----
$ oc adm top pods
NAME                         CPU(cores)   MEMORY(bytes)
hawkular-cassandra-1-pqx6l   219m         1240Mi
hawkular-metrics-rddnv       20m          1765Mi
heapster-n94r4               3m           37Mi
----

To view the usage statistics for pods with labels:

----
$ oc adm top pod --selector=''
----

You must choose the selector (label query) to filter on. Supports `=`, `==`, and `!=`.

[NOTE]
====
You must have `cluster-reader` permission to view the usage statistics.
====

[NOTE]
====
The `metrics-server` must be installed to view the usage statistics.

[[manage-pods-limit-run-once-duration]]
== Limiting Run-once Pod Duration

{product-title} relies on run-once pods to perform tasks such as deploying a pod
or performing a build. Run-once pods are pods that have a `RestartPolicy` of
`Never` or `OnFailure`.

The cluster administrator can use the *RunOnceDuration* admission control
plug-in to force a limit on the time that those run-once pods can be active.
Once the time limit expires, the cluster will try to actively terminate those
pods. The main reason to have such a limit is to prevent tasks such as builds to
run for an excessive amount of time.

[[configuring-the-run-once-duration-plug-in]]
=== Configuring the RunOnceDuration Plug-in

The plug-in configuration should include the default active deadline for
run-once pods. This deadline is enforced globally, but can be superseded on
a per-project basis.

[source,yaml]
----
admissionConfig:
  pluginConfig:
    RunOnceDuration:
      configuration:
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: RunOnceDurationConfig
        activeDeadlineSecondsOverride: 3600 <1>
....
----
<1> Specify the global default for run-once pods in seconds.

[[specifying-a-custom-duration-per-project]]
=== Specifying a Custom Duration per Project

In addition to specifying a global maximum duration for run-once pods, an
administrator can add an annotation
(`openshift.io/active-deadline-seconds-override`) to a specific project to
override the global default.

* For a new project, define the annotation in the project specification _.yaml_ file.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Project
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/active-deadline-seconds-override: "1000" <1>
  name: myproject
----
+
<1> Overrides the default active deadline seconds for run-once pods to 1000
seconds. Note that the value of the override must be specified in string form.

* For an existing project,

** Run `oc edit` and add the `openshift.io/active-deadline-seconds-override: 1000` annotation in the editor.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc edit namespace <project-name>
----
+
Or
+
** Use the `oc patch` command:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc patch namespace <project_name> -p '{"metadata":{"annotations":{"openshift.io/active-deadline-seconds-override":"1000"}}}'
----

==== Deploying an Egress Router Pod

.Example Pod Definition for an Egress Router
====

<1> IP address on the node subnet reserved by the cluster administrator for use by
this pod.
<2> Same value as the default gateway used by the node itself.
<3>  Connections to the pod are redirected to 203.0.113.25, with a source IP
address of 192.168.12.99
<4> The pod will only be deployed to nodes with the label site *springfield-1*.
====

The `pod.network.openshift.io/assign-macvlan annotation` creates a Macvlan
network interface on the primary network interface, and then moves it into the
pod's network name space before starting the *egress-router* container.

[NOTE]
====
Preserve the quotation marks around `"true"`. Omitting them will result in
errors.
====

The pod contains a single container, using the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*openshift3/ose-egress-router*
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*openshift/origin-egress-router*
endif::openshift-origin[]
image, and that container is run privileged so that it can configure the Macvlan
interface and set up `iptables` rules.

The environment variables tell the *egress-router* image what addresses to use; it
will configure the Macvlan interface to use `EGRESS_SOURCE` as its IP address,
with `EGRESS_GATEWAY` as its gateway.

NAT rules are set up so that connections to any TCP or UDP port on the
pod's cluster IP address are redirected to the same port on
`EGRESS_DESTINATION`.

If only some of the nodes in your cluster are capable of claiming the specified
source IP address and using the specified gateway, you can specify a
`nodeName` or `nodeSelector` indicating which nodes are acceptable.

[[admin-guide-deploying-an-egress-router-service]]
==== Deploying an Egress Router Service

Though not strictly necessary, you normally want to create a service pointing to
the egress router:

====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: egress-1
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
  - name: https
    port: 443
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    name: egress-1
----
====

Your pods can now connect to this service. Their connections are redirected to
the corresponding ports on the external server, using the reserved egress IP
address.

[[admin-guide-limit-pod-access-egress-pods]]
=== Limiting Pod Access with Egress Firewall

As an {product-title} cluster administrator, you can use egress policy to limit
the external addresses that some or all pods can access from within the cluster, so that:

- A pod can only talk to internal hosts, and cannot initiate connections to the
public Internet.
+
Or,
- A pod can only talk to the public Internet, and cannot initiate connections to
internal hosts (outside the cluster).
+
Or,
- A pod cannot reach specified internal subnets/hosts that it should have no
reason to contact.

For example, you can configure projects with different egress policies, allowing
`<project A>` access to a specified IP range, but denying the same access to
`<project B>`.

[CAUTION]
====
You must have the
xref:../install_config/configuring_sdn.adoc#install-config-configuring-sdn[*ovs-multitenant* plug-in] enabled in order to limit pod access via egress policy.
====

Project administrators can neither create `EgressNetworkPolicy` objects, nor
edit the ones you create in their project. There are also several other
restrictions on where `EgressNetworkPolicy` can be created:

. The `default` project (and any other project that has been made global via
`oc adm pod-network make-projects-global`) cannot have egress policy.

. If you merge two projects together (via `oc adm pod-network join-projects`),
then you cannot use egress policy in _any_ of the joined projects.

. No project may have more than one egress policy object.

Violating any of these restrictions will result in broken egress policy for the
project, and may cause all external network traffic to be dropped.

[[admin-guide-config-pod-access]]
==== Configuring Pod Access Limits

To configure pod access limits, you must use the `oc` command or the REST API.
You can use `oc [create|replace|delete]` to manipulate `EgressNetworkPolicy`
objects. The *_api/swagger-spec/oapi-v1.json_* file has API-level details on how
the objects actually work.

To configure pod access limits:

. Navigate to the project you want to affect.
. Create a JSON file for the pod limit policy:
+
----
# oc create -f <policy>.json
----
. Configure the JSON file with policy details. For example:
+
----
{
    "kind": "EgressNetworkPolicy",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "default"
    },
    "spec": {
        "egress": [
            {
                "type": "Allow",
                "to": {
                    "cidrSelector": "1.2.3.0/24"
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "Allow",
                "to": {
                    "dnsName": "www.foo.com"
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "Deny",
                "to": {
                    "cidrSelector": "0.0.0.0/0"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
----
+
When the example above is added in a project, it allows traffic to IP range
`1.2.3.0/24` and domain name `www.foo.com`, but denies access to all other
external IP addresses. (Traffic to other pods is not affected because the policy
only applies to _external_ traffic.)
+
The rules in an `EgressNetworkPolicy` are checked in order, and the first one
that matches takes effect. If the three rules in the above example were
reversed, then traffic would not be allowed to `1.2.3.0/24` and `www.foo.com`
because the `0.0.0.0/0` rule would be checked first, and it would match and deny
all traffic.
+
Domain name updates are reflected within 30 minutes. In the above example,
suppose `www.foo.com` resolved to `10.11.12.13`, but later it was changed to
`20.21.22.23`. Then, {product-title} will take up to 30 minutes to adapt to
these DNS updates.

[[admin-guide-manage-pods-limit-bandwidth]]
== Limiting the Bandwidth Available to Pods

You can apply quality-of-service traffic shaping to a pod and effectively limit
its available bandwidth. Egress traffic (from the pod) is handled by policing,
which simply drops packets in excess of the configured rate. Ingress traffic (to
the pod) is handled by shaping queued packets to effectively handle data. The
limits you place on a pod do not affect the bandwidth of other pods.

To limit the bandwidth on a pod:

. Write an object definition JSON file, and specify the data traffic speed using
`kubernetes.io/ingress-bandwidth` and `kubernetes.io/egress-bandwidth`
annotations. For example, to limit both pod egress and ingress bandwidth to 10M/s:
+
.Limited Pod Object Definition
----
{
    "kind": "Pod",
    "spec": {
        "containers": [
            {
                "image": "openshift/hello-openshift",
                "name": "hello-openshift"
            }
        ]
    },
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "iperf-slow",
        "annotations": {
            "kubernetes.io/ingress-bandwidth": "10M",
            "kubernetes.io/egress-bandwidth": "10M"
        }
    }
}
----

. Create the pod using the object definition:
+
----
oc create -f <file_or_dir_path>
----

[[managing-pods-poddisruptionbudget]]
== Setting Pod Disruption Budgets

A _pod disruption budget_ is part of the
link:http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/disruptions/[Kubernetes] API, which can be
managed with `oc` commands like other
xref:../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#object-types[object types]. They
allow the specification of safety constraints on pods during operations, such as
draining a node for maintenance.

`PodDisruptionBudget` is an API object that specifies the minimum number or
percentage of replicas that must be up at a time. Setting these in projects can
be helpful during node maintenance (such as scaling a cluster down or a cluster
upgrade) and is only honored on voluntary evictions (not on node failures).

A `PodDisruptionBudget` object's configuration consists of the following key
parts:

* A label selector, which is a label query over a set of pods.
* An availability level, which specifies the minimum number of pods that must be
 available simultaneously.

The following is an example of a `PodDisruptionBudget` resource:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1 <1>
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: my-pdb
spec:
  selector:  <2>
    matchLabels:
      foo: bar
  minAvailable: 2  <3>
----

<1> `PodDisruptionBudget` is part of the `policy/v1beta1` API group.
<2> A label query over a set of resources. The result of `matchLabels` and
 `matchExpressions` are logically conjoined.
<3> The minimum number of pods that must be available simultaneously. This can
be either an integer or a string specifying a percentage (for example, `20%`).

If you created a YAML file with the above object definition, you could add it to project with the following:

----
$ oc create -f </path/to/file> -n <project_name>
----

You can check for pod disruption budgets across all projects with the following:

----
$ oc get poddisruptionbudget --all-namespaces

NAMESPACE         NAME          MIN-AVAILABLE   SELECTOR
another-project   another-pdb   4               bar=foo
test-project      my-pdb        2               foo=bar
----

The `PodDisruptionBudget` is considered healthy when there are at least
`minAvailable` pods running in the system. Every pod above that limit can be
xref:../admin_guide/out_of_resource_handling.adoc#out-of-resource-eviction-policy[evicted].

[NOTE]
====
Depending on your xref:../admin_guide/scheduling/priority_preemption.adoc#admin-guide-priority-preemption[pod priority and preemption] settings,
lower-priority pods might be removed despite their pod disruption budget requirements.
====

[[admin-manage-pod-critical]]
== Configuring Critical Pods

There are a number of core components, such as DNS, that are critical to a fully functional cluster,
but, run on a regular cluster node rather than the master. A cluster may stop working properly if a critical add-on is evicted.
You can make a pod critical by adding the `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/critical-pod` annotation to the pod specification so that
the xref:../admin_guide/scheduling/descheduler.adoc#admin-guide-descheduler[descheduler] will not remove these pods.

----
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: critical-pod
      annotations:
        scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/critical-pod: "true"
----
