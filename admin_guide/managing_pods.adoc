== Overview

This topic describes the management of
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#pods[pods], including
managing their networks, limiting their run-once duration, and limiting what
they can access, and how much bandwidth they can use.

When your cluster is configured to use
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/sdn.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-sdn[the *ovs-multitenant* SDN
plug-in], you can manage the separate pod overlay networks for projects using
the administrator CLI.

[[joining-project-networks]]
=== Joining Project Networks

To join projects to an existing project network:

----
$ oadm pod-network join-projects --to=<project1> <project2> <project3>
----

In the above example, all the pods and services in `<project2>` and `<project3>`
can now access any pods and services in `<project1>` and vice versa.

Alternatively, instead of specifying specific project names, you can use the
`--selector=<project_selector>` option.

[[making-project-networks-global]]
=== Making Project Networks Global

To allow projects to access all pods and services in the cluster and vice versa:

----
$ oadm pod-network make-projects-global <project1> <project2>
----

In the above example, all the pods and services in `<project1>` and `<project2>`
can now access any pods and services in the cluster and vice versa.

Alternatively, instead of specifying specific project names, you can use the
`--selector=<project_selector>` option.

[[manage-pods-limit-run-once-duration]]
== Limiting Run-once Pod Duration

{product-title} relies on run-once pods to perform tasks such as
xref:../dev_guide/deployments.adoc#dev-guide-deployments[deploying a pod] or
xref:../dev_guide/builds.adoc#dev-guide-builds[performing a build]. Run-once pods are pods that
have a `*RestartPolicy*` of `Never` or `OnFailure`.

The cluster administrator can use the *RunOnceDuration* admission control
plug-in to force a limit on the time that those run-once pods can be active.
Once the time limit expires, the cluster will try to actively terminate those
pods. The main reason to have such a limit is to prevent tasks such as builds to
run for an excessive amount of time.

[[configuring-the-run-once-duration-plug-in]]
=== Configuring the RunOnceDuration Plug-in

The plug-in configuration should include the default active deadline for
run-once pods. This deadline will be enforced globally, but can be superseded on
a per-project basis.

====

[source,yaml]
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  admissionConfig:
    pluginConfig:
      RunOnceDuration:
        configuration:
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: RunOnceDurationConfig
          activeDeadlineSecondsOverride: 3600 <1>
----

<1> Specify the global default for run-once pods in seconds.

====

[[specifying-a-custom-duration-per-project]]
=== Specifying a Custom Duration per Project

In addition to specifying a global maximum duration for run-once pods, an
administrator can add an annotation
(`openshift.io/active-deadline-seconds-override`) to a specific project to
override the global default.

====

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Project
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/active-deadline-seconds-override: "1000" <1>
----

<1> Overrides the default active deadline seconds for run-once pods to 1000 seconds.
Note that the value of the override must be specified in string form.

[[admin-guide-limit-pod-access-egress]]
== Limiting Pod Access with Egress Firewall

As an {product-title} cluster administrator, you can use egress policy to limit
the addresses that some or all pods can access from within the cluster, so that:

- A pod can only talk to internal hosts, and cannot initiate connections to the
public Internet.
+
Or,
- A pod can only talk to the public Internet, and cannot initiate connections to
internal hosts (outside the cluster).
+
Or,
- A pod cannot reach specified internal subnets/hosts that it should have no
reason to contact.

For example, you can configure projects with different egress policies, allowing
`<project A>` access to a specified IP range, but denying the same access to
`<project B>`.

[CAUTION]
====
You must have the
xref:../install_config/configuring_sdn.adoc#install-config-configuring-sdn[*ovs-multitenant* plug-in] enabled in order to limit pod access via egress policy.
====

Project administrators can neither create `*EgressNetworkPolicy*` objects, nor
edit the ones you create in their project.

The `default` project (and any other global namespace) cannot have egress
policy.

[NOTE]
====
If you merge two projects together (via `oadm pod-network join-projects`),
then you cannot use egress policy in _any_ of the joined projects.

If you make a project global (via `oadm pod-network make-projects-global`),
then it cannot have an `*EgressNetworkPolicy*`.

If an allowed network overlaps with a denied network, then the rules are
checked in order, and the first one that matches is enforced.
====

[[admin-guide-config-pod-access]]
=== Configuring Pod Access Limits

To configure pod access limits, you must use the `oc` command or the REST API.
You can use `oc [create|replace|delete]` to manipulate `*EgressNetworkPolicy*`
objects. The *_api/swagger-spec/oapi-v1.json_* file has API-level details on how
the objects actually work.

To configure pod access limits:

. Navigate to the project you want to affect.
. Create a JSON file for the pod limit policy:
+
----
# oc create -f <policy>.json
----
. Configure the JSON file with policy details. For example:
+
----
{
    "kind": "EgressNetworkPolicy",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "default"
    },
    "spec": {
        "egress": [
            {
                "type": "Allow",
                "to": {
                    "cidrSelector": "1.2.3.0/24"
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "Deny",
                "to": {
                    "cidrSelector": "0.0.0.0/32"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
----
+
When the example above is added in a project, it allows traffic to `1.2.3.0/24`,
but denies access to all other external IP addresses. This would not affect
traffic to other pods.

[[admin-guide-manage-pods-limit-bandwidth]]
== Limiting the Bandwidth Available to Pods

You can apply quality-of-service traffic shaping to a pod and effectively limit
its available bandwidth. Egress traffic (from the pod) is handled by policing,
which simply drops packets in excess of the configured rate. Ingress traffic (to
the pod) is handled by shaping queued packets to effectively handle data. The
limits you place on a pod do not affect the bandwidth of other pods.

To limit the bandwidth on a pod:

. Write an object definition JSON file, and specify the data traffic speed using
`*kubernetes.io/ingress-bandwidth*` and `*kubernetes.io/egress-bandwidth*`
annotations. For example, to limit both pod egress and ingress bandwidth to 10M/s:
+
.Limited Pod Object Definition
====
----
{
    "kind": "Pod", 
    "spec": {
        "containers": [
            {
                "image": "nginx", 
                "name": "nginx"
            }
        ]
    }, 
    "apiVersion": "v1", 
    "metadata": {
        "name": "iperf-slow", 
        "annotations": {
            "kubernetes.io/ingress-bandwidth": "10M", 
            "kubernetes.io/egress-bandwidth": "10M"
        }
    }
}
----
====
. Create the pod using the object definition:
+
----
oc create -f <file_or_dir_path>
----
