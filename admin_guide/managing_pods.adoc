== Overview

This topic describes the management of
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#pods[pods], including
limiting their run-once duration, and how much bandwidth they can use.

== Limiting Run-once Pod Duration

{product-title} relies on run-once pods to perform tasks such as deploying a pod
or performing a build. Run-once pods are pods that have a `RestartPolicy` of
`Never` or `OnFailure`.

The cluster administrator can use the *RunOnceDuration* admission control
plug-in to force a limit on the time that those run-once pods can be active.
Once the time limit expires, the cluster will try to actively terminate those
pods. The main reason to have such a limit is to prevent tasks such as builds to
run for an excessive amount of time.

[[configuring-the-run-once-duration-plug-in]]
=== Configuring the RunOnceDuration Plug-in

The plug-in configuration should include the default active deadline for
run-once pods. This deadline is enforced globally, but can be superseded on
a per-project basis.

====

[source,yaml]
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  admissionConfig:
    pluginConfig:
      RunOnceDuration:
        configuration:
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: RunOnceDurationConfig
          activeDeadlineSecondsOverride: 3600 <1>
----

<1> Specify the global default for run-once pods in seconds.

====

[[specifying-a-custom-duration-per-project]]
=== Specifying a Custom Duration per Project

In addition to specifying a global maximum duration for run-once pods, an
administrator can add an annotation
(`openshift.io/active-deadline-seconds-override`) to a specific project to
override the global default.

====

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Project
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/active-deadline-seconds-override: "1000" <1>
----

<1> Overrides the default active deadline seconds for run-once pods to 1000 seconds.
Note that the value of the override must be specified in string form.

[[admin-guide-manage-pods-limit-bandwidth]]
== Limiting the Bandwidth Available to Pods

You can apply quality-of-service traffic shaping to a pod and effectively limit
its available bandwidth. Egress traffic (from the pod) is handled by policing,
which simply drops packets in excess of the configured rate. Ingress traffic (to
the pod) is handled by shaping queued packets to effectively handle data. The
limits you place on a pod do not affect the bandwidth of other pods.

To limit the bandwidth on a pod:

. Write an object definition JSON file, and specify the data traffic speed using
`kubernetes.io/ingress-bandwidth` and `kubernetes.io/egress-bandwidth`
annotations. For example, to limit both pod egress and ingress bandwidth to 10M/s:
+

    "kind": "Pod",
    "spec": {
        "containers": [
            {
                "image": "nginx",
                "name": "nginx"
            }
        ]
    },
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "iperf-slow",
        "annotations": {
            "kubernetes.io/ingress-bandwidth": "10M",
            "kubernetes.io/egress-bandwidth": "10M"
        }
    }
}

== Setting Pod Disruption Budgets

A _pod disruption budget_ is part of the
link:http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/disruptions/[Kubernetes] API, which can be
managed with `oc` commands like other
xref:../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#object-types[object types]. They
allow the specification of safety constraints on pods during operations, such as
draining a node for maintenance.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[NOTE]
====
Starting in {product-title} 3.6, pod disruption budgets are now fully supported. 
====
endif::[]

`PodDisruptionBudget` is an API object that specifies the minimum number or
percentage of replicas that must be up at a time. Setting these in projects can
be helpful during node maintenance (such as scaling a cluster down or a cluster
upgrade) and is only honored on voluntary evictions (not on node failures).

A `PodDisruptionBudget` object's configuration consists of the following key
parts:

* A label selector, which is a label query over a set of pods.
* An availability level, which specifies the minimum number of pods that must be
 available simultaneously.

The following is an example of a `PodDisruptionBudget` resource:

====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1 <1>
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: my-pdb
spec:
  selector:  <2>
    matchLabels:
      foo: bar
  minAvailable: 2  <3>
----

<1> `PodDisruptionBudget` is part of the `policy/v1beta1` API group.
<2> A label query over a set of resources. The result of `matchLabels` and
 `matchExpressions` are logically conjoined.
<3> The minimum number of pods that must be available simultaneously. This can
be either an integer or a string specifying a percentage (for example, `20%`).
====

If you created a YAML file with the above object definition, you could add it to project with the following:

----
$ oc create -f </path/to/file> -n <project_name>
----

You can check for pod disruption budgets across all projects with the following:

----
$ oc get poddisruptionbudget --all-namespaces

NAMESPACE         NAME          MIN-AVAILABLE   SELECTOR
another-project   another-pdb   4               bar=foo
test-project      my-pdb        2               foo=bar
----

The `PodDisruptionBudget` is considered healthy when there are at least
`minAvailable` pods running in the system. Every pod above that limit can be
xref:../admin_guide/out_of_resource_handling.adoc#out-of-resource-eviction-policy[evicted].
