== Overview
You can provision your OpenShift cluster with
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent storage] using
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Storage_Administration_Guide/ch-nfs.html[NFS].
Some familiarity with Kubernetes and NFS is assumed.

The Kubernetes xref:../dev_guide/persistent_volumes.adoc#dev-guide-persistent-volumes[persistent volume]
framework allows administrators to provision a cluster with persistent storage
and gives users a way to request those resources without having any knowledge of
the underlying infrastructure.

For a detailed example, see the guide for
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/wordpress[WordPress and
MySQL using NFS].

[IMPORTANT]
====
High-availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.
====

[[provisioning]]

== Provisioning
Storage must exist in the underlying infrastructure before it can be mounted as
a volume in OpenShift. All that is required for NFS is a distinct list of
servers and paths and the `*PersistentVolume*` API.

  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "kind": "PersistentVolume",

    "name": "pv0001"

  }

[[enforcing-disk-quotas]]

=== Enforcing Disk Quotas
Use disk partitions to enforce disk quotas and size constraints. Each partition
can be its own export. Each export is one persistent volume. Kubernetes enforces
unique names for persistent volumes, but the uniqueness of the NFS volume's
server and path is up to the administrator.

Enforcing quotas in this way allows the end user to request persistent storage
by a specific amount (e.g, 10Gi) and be matched with a corresponding volume of
equal or greater capacity.

[[volume-security]]

=== Volume Security
Users request storage with a `*PersistentVolumeClaim*`. This claim only lives in
the user's namespace and can only be referenced by a pod within that same
namespace. Any attempt to access a persistent volume across a namespace causes
the pod to fail.

Each NFS volume must be mountable by all nodes in the cluster.

[[reclaiming-resources]]

== Reclaiming Resources
NFS implements the Kubernetes *Recyclable* plug-in interface. Automatic
processes handle reclamation tasks based on policies set on each persistent
volume.

By default, persistent volumes are set to *Retain*. NFS volumes which are set to
*Recycle* are scrubbed (i.e., `rm -rf` is run on the volume) after being
released from their claim (i.e, after the user's `*PersistentVolumeClaim*` bound
to the volume is deleted). Once recycled, the NFS volume can be bound to a new
claim.

[[automation]]

== Automation
As discussed, clusters can be provisioned with persistent storage using NFS in
the following way:

- Disk partitions can be used to xref:enforcing-disk-quotas[enforce storage
quotas].
- Security can be enforced by xref:volume-security[restricting volumes] to the
namespace that has a claim to them.
- xref:reclaiming-resources[Reclamation of discarded resources] can be
configured for each persistent volume.

They are many ways that you can use scripts to automate the above tasks. You can
use an
link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/tree/master/roles/kube_nfs_volumes[example
Ansible playbook] to help you get started.

[[selinux-and-nfs-export-settings]]

== SELinux and NFS Export Settings
By default, SELinux does not allow writing from a pod to a remote NFS server.
The NFS volume mounts correctly, but is read-only.

To enable writing in SELinux on each node:

----
# setsebool -P virt_use_nfs 1
----

The `-P` option makes the bool persistent between reboots.

Additionally, in order to enable arbitrary container users to read and write the
volume, each exported volume on the NFS server itself should conform to the
following:

- Each export must be:

----
/<example_fs> *(rw,all_squash)
----

- Each export must be owned by *nfsnobody*:

----
chown -R nfsnobody:nfsnobody /<example_fs>
----

- Each export must have the following permissions:

----
chmod 777 /<example_fs>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The export definition above allows arbitrary network clients to mount this
volume. Exports can be restricted to a range of IP addresses for hosts that will
access the volume. See `man exports` for more information.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Starting in OpenShift Enterprise 3.1, the export values have changed. See the https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_nfs.html[OpenShift Enterprise 3.1 documentation] for instructions on ensuring proper security for NFS in 3.1.
