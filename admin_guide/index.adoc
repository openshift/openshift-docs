[[admin-guide-index-dedicated-admin-role]]
== Dedicated Administrator Role
As a dedicated administrator of an {product-title} cluster, your account has increased
permissions and access to all user-created projects. If you are new to the role,
check out the Getting Started topic on
xref:../getting_started/dedicated_administrators.adoc#getting-started-dedicated-administrators[Administering an
{product-title} Cluster] for a quick overview.

[NOTE]
====
_Some configuration changes or procedures discussed in this guide may be
performed only by the {product-title} Operations Team. They are included in this
guide for informational purposes to help you as an {product-title} cluster
administrator better understand what configuration options are possible. If you
would like to request a change to your cluster that you cannot perform using the
administrator CLI, open a support case on the
https://access.redhat.com/support/[Red Hat Customer Portal]._
====

When your account has the *dedicated-cluster-admin* authorization role
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authorization[bound] to it, you
are automatically bound to the *dedicated-project-admin* for any new projects
that are created by users in the cluster.

You can perform actions associated with a set of
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#evaluating-authorization[verbs]
(e.g., `create`) to operate on a set of
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#evaluating-authorization[resource
names] (e.g., `templates`). To view the details of these roles and their sets of
verbs and resources, run the following:

----
$ oc describe clusterrole/dedicated-cluster-admin
$ oc describe clusterrole/dedicated-project-admin
----

The verb names do not necessarily all map directly to `oc` commands, but rather
equate more generally to the types of CLI operations you can perform. For
example, having the *list* verb means that you can display a list of all objects
of a given resource name (e.g., using `oc get`), while *get* means that you can
display the details of a specific object if you know its name (e.g., using `oc
describe`).

[[admin-guide-index-project-level-permissions]]
== Project-level Permissions

At the project level, an administrator of an {product-title} cluster can perform
all actions that a project administrator can perform. In addition, the
{product-title} administrator can set
xref:../admin_guide/quota.adoc#admin-guide-quota[resource quotas] and
xref:../admin_guide/limits.adoc#admin-guide-limits[limit ranges] for the
project.
