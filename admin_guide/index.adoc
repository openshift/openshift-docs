These Cluster Administration topics cover the day-to-day tasks for managing
your {product-title} cluster and other advanced configuration topics.

ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-aro[]
[[admin-guide-index-dedicated-admin-role]]
== {cluster-admin-name} Role
As a {cluster-admin-name} of an {product-title} cluster, your account has increased
permissions and access to all user-created projects. If you are new to the role,
check out the Getting Started topic on
xref:../getting_started/dedicated_administrators.adoc#getting-started-dedicated-administrators[Administering an
{product-title} Cluster] for a quick overview.

[NOTE]
====
Some configuration changes or procedures discussed in this guide may be
performed only by the {product-title} Operations Team. They are included in this
guide for informational purposes to help you as an {product-title} cluster
administrator better understand what configuration options are possible. If you
would like to request a change to your cluster that you cannot perform using the
administrator CLI, open a support case on the
https://access.redhat.com/support/[Red Hat Customer Portal].
====

When your account has the `{cluster-admin-role}` authorization role
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authorization[bound] to it, you
are automatically bound to the `{project-admin-role}` for any new projects
that are created by users in the cluster.

You can perform actions associated with a set of
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#evaluating-authorization[verbs]
(e.g., `create`) to operate on a set of
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#evaluating-authorization[resource
names] (e.g., `templates`). To view the details of these roles and their sets of
verbs and resources, run the following:

[subs="attributes"]
----
$ oc describe clusterrole/{cluster-admin-role}
$ oc describe clusterrole/{project-admin-role}
----

The verb names do not necessarily all map directly to `oc` commands, but rather
equate more generally to the types of CLI operations you can perform. For
example, having the `list` verb means that you can display a list of all objects
of a given resource name (e.g., using `oc get`), while `get` means that you can
display the details of a specific object if you know its name (e.g., using `oc
describe`).

ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
{product-title} administrators can grant users a `dedicated-reader` role, which
provides view-only access at the cluster level, as well as view access for all
user projects.
endif::[]

[[admin-guide-index-project-level-permissions]]
== Project-level Permissions

At the project level, an administrator of an {product-title} cluster can perform
all actions that a project administrator can perform. In addition, the
{product-title} administrator can set
xref:../admin_guide/quota.adoc#admin-guide-quota[resource quotas] and
xref:../admin_guide/limits.adoc#admin-guide-limits[limit ranges] for the
project.
