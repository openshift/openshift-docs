WHAT IS THE OPENSHIFT DEDICATED ADMINISTRATOR ROLE?::
As an administrator of an {product-title} cluster, your account has increased
permissions and access to all user-created projects. If you are new to the role,
check out the Getting Started topic on
xref:../getting_started/dedicated_administrators.adoc#getting-started-dedicated-administrators[Administering an
{product-title} Cluster] for a quick overview.

[NOTE]
====
_Some configuration changes or procedures discussed in this guide may be
performed only by the OpenShift Operations Team. They are included in this guide for
informational purposes to help you as an {product-title} cluster administrator
better understand what configuration options are possible. If you would like to
request a change to your cluster that you cannot perform using the administrator
CLI, please open a support case on the https://access.redhat.com/support/[Red
Hat Customer Portal]._
====

When your account has the *dedicated-cluster-admin* authorization role
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authorization[bound] to it, you
are automatically bound to the *dedicated-project-admin* for any new projects
that are created by users in the cluster.

You can perform actions associated with a set of
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#evaluating-authorization[verbs]
(e.g., `create`) to operate on a set of
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#evaluating-authorization[resource
names] (e.g., `templates`). To view the details of these roles and their sets of
verbs and resources, run the following:

----
$ oc describe clusterrole/dedicated-cluster-admin
$ oc describe clusterrole/dedicated-project-admin
----

The verb names do not necessarily all map directly to `oc` commands, but rather
equate more generally to the types of CLI operations you can perform. For
example, having the *list* verb means that you can display a list of all objects
of a given resource name (e.g., using `oc get`), while *get* means that you can
display the details of a specific object if you know its name (e.g., using `oc
describe`).
