== Overview

The `oc adm diagnostics` command runs a series of checks for error conditions in
the host or cluster. Specifically, it:

* Verifies that the default registry and router are running and correctly
configured.
* Checks `*ClusterRoleBindings*` and `*ClusterRoles*` for consistency with base
policy.
* Checks that all of the client configuration contexts are valid and can be
connected to.
* Checks that SkyDNS is working properly and the pods have SDN connectivity.
* Validates master and node configuration on the host.
* Checks that nodes are running and available.
* Analyzes host logs for known errors.
* Checks that systemd units are configured as expected for the host.

== Using the Diagnostics Tool

To use the diagnostics tool, preferably on a master host and as cluster
administrator, run:

----
$ oc adm diagnostics
----

This runs all available diagnostics, skipping any that do not apply. For
example, the *NodeConfigCheck* does not run unless a node configuration is
available. You can also run specific diagnostics by name as you work to address
issues. For example:

----
$ oc adm diagnostics NodeConfigCheck UnitStatus
----
