== Overview

The `oc adm diagnostics` command runs a series of checks for error conditions in
the host or cluster. Specifically, it:

* Verifies that the default registry and router are running and correctly
configured.
* Checks `*ClusterRoleBindings*` and `*ClusterRoles*` for consistency with base
policy.
* Checks that all of the client configuration contexts are valid and can be
connected to.
* Checks that SkyDNS is working properly and the pods have SDN connectivity.
* Validates master and node configuration on the host.
* Checks that nodes are running and available.
* Analyzes host logs for known errors.
* Checks that systemd units are configured as expected for the host.


[[admin-guide-using-the-diagnostics-tool]]
== Using the Diagnostics Tool

You can deploy {product-title} in several ways. These include:

* Built from source
* Included within a VM image
* As a container image
* Using enterprise RPMs

Each method is suited for a different configuration and environment. To minimize
environment assumptions, the diagnostics tool is included with the `openshift`
binary to provide diagnostics within an {product-title} server or client.

To use the diagnostics tool, preferably on a master host and as cluster
administrator, run:

[source,terminal]
----
# oc adm diagnostics
----

This runs all available diagnostics and skips any that do not apply to the environment.

You can run a specific diagnostics by name or run specific
diagnostics by name as you work to address issues. For example:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm diagnostics
----

The options for the diagnostics tool require working configuration files. For
example, the *NodeConfigCheck* does not run unless a node configuration is
available.

The diagnostics tool uses the standard configuration file locations by default:

* Client:
** As indicated by the `$KUBECONFIG` environment variable
**  *_~/.kube/config file_*
* Master:
** *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*
* Node:
** *_/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml_*

You can specify non-standard locations with the `--config`, `--master-config`,
and `--node-config` options. If a configuration file is not specified,
related diagnostics are skipped.

Available diagnostics include:

[options="header"]
|===

|Diagnostic Name |Purpose

|`AggregatedLogging`
|Check the aggregated logging integration for proper configuration and operation.

|`AnalyzeLogs`
|Check systemd service logs for problems. Does not require a configuration file to check against.

|`ClusterRegistry`
|Check that the cluster has a working container image registry for builds and image streams.

|`ClusterRoleBindings`
|Check that the default cluster role bindings are present and contain the expected subjects according to base policy.

|`ClusterRoles`
|Check that cluster roles are present and contain the expected permissions according to base policy.

|`ClusterRouter`
|Check for a working default router in the cluster.

|`ConfigContexts`
|Check that each context in the client configuration is complete and has connectivity to its API server.

|`DiagnosticPod`
|Creates a pod that runs diagnostics from an application standpoint, which checks that DNS within the pod is working as expected and the credentials for the default service account authenticate correctly to the master API.

|`EtcdWriteVolume`
|Check the volume of writes against etcd for a time period and classify them by operation and key. This diagnostic only runs if specifically requested, because it does not run as quickly as other diagnostics and can increase load on etcd.

|`MasterConfigCheck`
|Check this host's master configuration file for problems.

|`MasterNode`
|Check that the master running on this host is also running a node to verify that it is a member of the cluster SDN.

|`MetricsApiProxy`
|Check that the integrated Heapster metrics can be reached via the cluster API proxy.

|`NetworkCheck`
|Create diagnostic pods on multiple nodes to diagnose common network issues from
an application or pod standpoint. Run this diagnostic when the master can
schedule pods on nodes, but the pods have connection issues. This check confirms
that pods can connect to services, other pods, and the external network.

If there are any errors, this diagnostic stores results and retrieved files in a local directory (*_/tmp/openshift/_*, by default) for further analysis. The directory can be specified with the `--network-logdir` flag.

|`NodeConfigCheck`
|Checks this host's node configuration file for problems.

|`NodeDefinitions`
|Check that the nodes defined in the master API are ready and can schedule pods.

|`RouteCertificateValidation`
|Check all route certificates for those that might be rejected by extended validation.

|`ServiceExternalIPs`
|Check for existing services that specify external IPs, which are disallowed according to master configuration.

|`UnitStatus`
|Check systemd status for units on this host related to {product-title}. Does not require a configuration file to check against.

[[admin-guide-diagnostics-tool-server-environment]]
== Running Diagnostics in a Server Environment

An Ansible-deployed cluster provides additional diagnostic benefits for
nodes within an {product-title} cluster. These include:

* Master and node configuration is based on a configuration file in a standard
location.
* Systemd units are configured to manage the server(s).
* Both master and node configuration files are in standard locations.
* Systemd units are created and configured for managing the nodes in a cluster.
* All components log to journald.

Keeping to the default location of the configuration files placed by an
Ansible-deployed cluster ensures that running `oc adm diagnostics` works without
any flags. If you are not using the default location for the configuration
files, you must use the `--master-config` and `--node-config` options:

[source,terminal]
----
# oc adm diagnostics --master-config=<file_path> --node-config=<file_path>
----

Systemd units and logs entries in journald are necessary for the current log
diagnostic logic. For other deployment types, logs can be stored in single
files, stored in files that combine node and master logs, or printed to stdout.
If log entries do not use journald, the log diagnostics cannot work and do not
run.

[[admin-guide-diagnostics-tool-client-environment]]
== Running Diagnostics in a Client Environment

You can run the diagnostics tool as an ordinary user or a `cluster-admin`, and
it runs using the level of permissions granted to the  account from which you
run it.

A client with ordinary access can diagnose its connection to the master and run
a diagnostic pod. If multiple users or masters are configured, connections are
tested for all, but the diagnostic pod only runs against the current user,
server, or project.

A client with `cluster-admin` access can diagnose the status of infrastructure
such as nodes, registry, and router. In each case, running `oc adm diagnostics`
searches for the standard client configuration file in its standard location and
uses it if available.

[[ansible-based-tooling-health-checks]]
== Ansible-based Health Checks

// tag::ansible-based-health-checks-intro[]
Additional diagnostic health checks are available through the
xref:../install/index.adoc#install-planning[Ansible-based tooling] used to install and manage {product-title} clusters. They can report
common deployment problems for the current {product-title} installation.

These checks can be run either using the `ansible-playbook` command (the same
method used during
xref:../install/running_install.adoc#install-running-installation-playbooks[cluster installations]) or as a link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/blob/master/README_CONTAINER_IMAGE.md[containerized version] of *openshift-ansible*. For the `ansible-playbook` method, the checks
are provided by the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*openshift-ansible* RPM package.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
xref:../install/host_preparation.adoc#preparing-for-advanced-installations-origin[*openshift-ansible*]
Git repository.
endif::[]
For the containerized method,
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
the *openshift3/ose-ansible* container image is distributed via the
link:https://registry.redhat.io[Red Hat Container Registry].
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
the *openshift/origin-ansible* container image is distributed via Docker Hub.
endif::[]
// end::ansible-based-health-checks-intro[]
Example usage for each method are provided in subsequent sections.

The following health checks are a set of diagnostic tasks that are meant to be
run against the Ansible inventory file for a deployed {product-title} cluster
using the provided *_health.yml_* playbook.

[WARNING]
====
Due to potential changes the health check playbooks can make to the environment,
you must run the playbooks against only Ansible-deployed clusters and using the
same inventory file used for deployment. The changes consist of installing
dependencies so that the checks can gather the required information. In some
circumstances, additional system components, such as `docker` or networking
configurations, can change if their current state differs from the configuration
in the inventory file. You should run these health checks only if you do not
expect the inventory file to make any changes to the existing cluster
configuration.

.Diagnostic Health Checks
[options="header"]
|===

|Check Name |Purpose

|`etcd_imagedata_size`
|This check measures the total size of {product-title} image data in an etcd
cluster. The check fails if the calculated size exceeds a user-defined limit. If
no limit is specified, this check fails if the size of image data amounts to
50% or more of the currently used space in the etcd cluster.

A failure from this check indicates that a significant amount of space in etcd
is being taken up by {product-title} image data, which can eventually result in
the etcd cluster crashing.

A user-defined limit may be set by passing the `etcd_max_image_data_size_bytes`
variable. For example, setting `etcd_max_image_data_size_bytes=40000000000`
causes the check to fail if the total size of image data stored in etcd exceeds
40 GB.

|`etcd_traffic`
|This check detects higher-than-normal traffic on an etcd host. It fails if a
`journalctl` log entry with an etcd sync duration warning is found.

For further information on improving etcd performance, see
xref:../scaling_performance/host_practices.adoc#scaling-performance-capacity-host-practices-etcd[Recommended Practices for {product-title} etcd Hosts] and the
link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2916381[Red Hat Knowledgebase].

|`etcd_volume`
|This check ensures that the volume usage for an etcd cluster is below a maximum
user-specified threshold. If no maximum threshold value is specified, it is
defaulted to `90%` of the total volume size.

A user-defined limit may be set by passing the
`etcd_device_usage_threshold_percent` variable.

|`docker_storage`
|Only runs on hosts that depend on the *docker* daemon (nodes and containerized
installations). Checks that *docker*'s total usage does not exceed a
user-defined limit. If no user-defined limit is set, *docker*'s maximum usage
threshold defaults to 90% of the total size available.

You can set the threshold limit for total percent usage with a variable in the
inventory file, for example `max_thinpool_data_usage_percent=90`.

This also checks that *docker*'s storage is using a
xref:../scaling_performance/optimizing_storage.adoc#choosing-a-graph-driver[supported configuration].

|`curator`, `elasticsearch`, `fluentd`, `kibana`
|This set of checks verifies that Curator, Kibana, Elasticsearch, and Fluentd
pods have been deployed and are in a `running` state, and that a connection can
be established between the control host and the exposed Kibana URL. These checks
run only if the `openshift_logging_install_logging` inventory variable is set to
`true` to ensure that they are executed in a deployment where
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#install-config-aggregate-logging[cluster
logging] is enabled.

|`logging_index_time`
|This check detects higher than normal time delays between log creation and log
aggregation by Elasticsearch in a logging stack deployment. It fails if a new
log entry cannot be queried through Elasticsearch within a timeout (by default,
30 seconds). The check only runs if logging is enabled.

A user-defined timeout may be set by passing the
`openshift_check_logging_index_timeout_seconds` variable. For example, setting
`openshift_check_logging_index_timeout_seconds=45` causes the check to fail
if a newly-created log entry is not able to be queried via Elasticsearch after
45 seconds.

|`sdn`
a|This check performs the following cluster-level diagnostics of the
{product-title} SDN:

* Verify that master hosts can connect to kubelets.
* Verify that nodes can route packets to each other.
* Validate node addresses.
* Validate HostSubnet objects.

If you specify the `*openshift_checks_output_dir*` variable with the
`ansible-playbook` command, the check also saves networking-related objects
from the {product-title} API as well as logs, OVS flows, iptables rules, and
other network configuration information under the specified directory.  See the
example usage of the `ansible-playbook` command below for examples of how to
set variables.

This check can help you diagnose pod or infrastructure problems when the `oc
adm diagnostics` command cannot schedule diagnostic pods or the diagnostic pods
do not provide enough information to troubleshoot the issue.

[NOTE]
====
A similar set of checks meant to run as part of the installation process can be
found in
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-cluster-pre-install-checks[Configuring Cluster Pre-install Checks]. Another set of checks for checking certificate
expiration can be found in
xref:../install_config/redeploying_certificates.adoc#install-config-redeploying-certificates[Redeploying Certificates].

[[admin-guide-health-checks-via-ansible-playbook]]
=== Running Health Checks via ansible-playbook

To run the *openshift-ansible* health checks using the `ansible-playbook`
command, change to the playbook directory, specify your cluster's inventory file, and run the *_health.yml_*
playbook:

[source,terminal]
----
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible
$ ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> \
    playbooks/openshift-checks/health.yml
----

To set variables in the command line, include the `-e` flag with any desired
variables in `key=value` format. For example:

[source,terminal]
----
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible
$ ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> \
    playbooks/openshift-checks/health.yml \
    -e openshift_check_logging_index_timeout_seconds=45 \
    -e etcd_max_image_data_size_bytes=40000000000
----

To disable specific checks, include the variable `openshift_disable_check` with
a comma-delimited list of check names in your inventory file before running the
playbook. For example:

----
openshift_disable_check=etcd_traffic,etcd_volume
----

Alternatively, set any checks to disable as variables with `-e
openshift_disable_check=<check1>,<check2>` when running the `ansible-playbook`
command.

[[admin-guide-health-checks-via-docker-cli]]
=== Running Health Checks via Docker CLI

You can run the *openshift-ansible* playbooks in a container,
avoiding the need for installing and configuring Ansible, on any host that can
run the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*ose-ansible*
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*origin-ansible*
endif::[]
image via the Docker CLI.

Run the following as a non-root user that has privileges to run containers:

[source,terminal]
----
# docker run -u `id -u` \ <1>
    -v $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa:/opt/app-root/src/.ssh/id_rsa:Z,ro \ <2>
    -v /etc/ansible/hosts:/tmp/inventory:ro \ <3>
    -e INVENTORY_FILE=/tmp/inventory \
    -e PLAYBOOK_FILE=playbooks/openshift-checks/health.yml \ <4>
    -e OPTS="-v -e openshift_check_logging_index_timeout_seconds=45 -e etcd_max_image_data_size_bytes=40000000000" \ <5>
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
    openshift3/ose-ansible
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
    openshift/origin-ansible
endif::[]
----
<1> These options make the container run with the same UID as the current user,
which is required for permissions so that the SSH key can be read inside the
container (SSH private keys are expected to be readable only by their owner).
<2> Mount SSH keys as a volume under *_/opt/app-root/src/.ssh_* under normal usage
when running the container as a non-root user.
<3> Change *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* to the location of the cluster's inventory file,
if different. This file is bind-mounted to *_/tmp/inventory_*, which is
used according to the `INVENTORY_FILE` environment variable in the container.
<4> The `PLAYBOOK_FILE` environment variable is set to the location of the
*_health.yml_* playbook relative to *_/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible_*
inside the container.
<5> Set any variables desired for a single run with the `-e key=value` format.

In the previous command, the SSH key is mounted with the `:Z` option so that the
container can read the SSH key from its restricted SELinux context. Adding this
option means that your original SSH key file is relabeled similarly to
`system_u:object_r:container_file_t:s0:c113,c247`. For more details about `:Z`,
see the `docker-run(1)` man page.

[IMPORTANT]
====
These volume mount specifications can have unexpected consequences. For example,
if you mount, and ￼therefore relabel, the *_$HOME/.ssh_* directory, *sshd*
becomes unable to access the public keys to allow remote login. To avoid
altering the original file labels, mount a copy of the SSH key or directory.
====

Mounting an entire *_.ssh_* directory can be helpful for:

* Allowing you to use an SSH configuration to match keys with hosts or
modify other connection parameters.
* Allowing a user to provide a *_known_hosts_* file and have SSH validate host keys. This is disabled by the default configuration and can be re-enabled with an environment variable by adding `-e ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=True` to the `docker` command line.
