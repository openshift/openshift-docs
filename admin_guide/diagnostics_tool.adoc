== Overview

The `oc adm diagnostics` command runs a series of checks for error conditions in
the host or cluster. Specifically, it:

* Verifies that the default registry and router are running and correctly
configured.
* Checks `*ClusterRoleBindings*` and `*ClusterRoles*` for consistency with base
policy.
* Checks that all of the client configuration contexts are valid and can be
connected to.
* Checks that SkyDNS is working properly and the pods have SDN connectivity.
* Validates master and node configuration on the host.
* Checks that nodes are running and available.
* Analyzes host logs for known errors.
* Checks that systemd units are configured as expected for the host.

== Using the Diagnostics Tool

{product-title} can be deployed in many ways: built from source, included in a
VM image, in a container image, or as enterprise RPMs. Each method implies a
different configuration and environment. To minimize environment assumptions,
the diagnostics were added to the `openshift` binary so that wherever there is
an {product-title} server or client, the diagnostics can run in the exact same
environment.

To use the diagnostics tool, preferably on a master host and as cluster
administrator, run:

----
$ oc adm diagnostics
----

This runs all available diagnostics, skipping any that do not apply.

You can run one or multiple specific diagnostics by name, or run specific
diagnostics by name as you work to address issues. For example:

----
$ oc adm diagnostics <name1> <name2>
----

The options mostly require working configuration files. For example, the
*NodeConfigCheck* does not run unless a node configuration is available.

Diagnostics look for configuration files in standard locations:

* Client:
** As indicated by the `$KUBECONFIG` environment variable variable
**  *_~/.kube/config file_*
* Master:
** *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*
* Node:
** *_/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml_*

Non-standard locations can be specified with flags (respectively,
`--config`, `--master-config`, and `--node-config`). If a configuration file
is not found or specified, related diagnostics are skipped.

Available diagnostics include:

[options="header"]
|===

|Diagnostic Name |Purpose

|`AggregatedLogging`
|Check the aggregated logging integration for proper configuration and operation.

|`AnalyzeLogs`
|Check systemd service logs for problems. Does not require a configuration file to check against.

|`ClusterRegistry`
|Check that the cluster has a working Docker registry for builds and image streams.

|`ClusterRoleBindings`
|Check that the default cluster role bindings are present and contain the expected subjects according to base policy.

|`ClusterRoles`
|Check that cluster roles are present and contain the expected permissions according to base policy.

|`ClusterRouter`
|Check for a working default router in the cluster.

|`ConfigContexts`
|Check that each context in the client configuration is complete and has connectivity to its API server.

|`DiagnosticPod`
|Creates a pod that runs diagnostics from an application standpoint, which checks that DNS within the pod is working as expected and the credentials for the default service account authenticate correctly to the master API.

|`EtcdWriteVolume`
|Check the volume of writes against etcd for a time period and classify them by operation and key. This diagnostic only runs if specifically requested, because it does not run as quickly as other diagnostics and can increase load on etcd.

|`MasterConfigCheck`
|Check this host's master configuration file for problems.

|`MasterNode`
|Check that the master running on this host is also running a node to verify that it is a member of the cluster SDN.

|`MetricsApiProxy`
|Check that the integrated Heapster metrics can be reached via the cluster API proxy.

|`NetworkCheck`
|Create diagnostic pods on multiple nodes to diagnose common network issues from an application standpoint. For example, this checks that pods can connect to services, other pods, and the external network.

If there are any errors, this diagnostic stores results and retrieved files in a local directory (*_/tmp/openshift/_*, by default) for further analysis. The directory can be specified with the `--network-logdir` flag.

|`NodeConfigCheck`
|Checks this host's node configuration file for problems.

|`NodeDefinitions`
|Check that the nodes defined in the master API are ready and can schedule pods.

|`RouteCertificateValidation`
|Check all route certificates for those that might be rejected by extended validation.

|`ServiceExternalIPs`
|Check for existing services that specify external IPs, which are disallowed according to master configuration.

|`UnitStatus`
|Check systemd status for units on this host related to {product-title}. Does not require a configuration file to check against.

[[admin-guide-diagnostics-tool-server-environment]]
== Running Diagnostics in a Server Environment

Master and node diagnostics are most useful in an Ansible-deployed cluster. This
provides some diagnostic benefits:

* Master and node configuration is based on a configuration file in a standard
location.
* Systemd units are configured to manage the server(s).
* All components log to journald.

Having configuration files where Ansible places them means that you will
generally not need to specify where to find them. Running `oc adm diagnostics`
without flags will look for master and node configurations in the standard
locations and use them if found; this should make the Ansible-installed use case
as simple as possible. Also, it is easy to specify configuration files that are
not in the expected locations:

----
$ oc adm diagnostics --master-config=<file_path> --node-config=<file_path>
----

Systemd units and logs entries in journald are necessary for the current log
diagnostic logic. For other deployment types, logs may be going into files, to
stdout, or may combine node and master. At this time, for these situations, log
diagnostics are not able to work properly and will be skipped.

[[admin-guide-diagnostics-tool-client-environment]]
== Running Diagnostics in a Client Environment

You may have access as an ordinary user, and/or as a *cluster-admin* user,
and/or may be running on a host where {product-title} master or node servers are
operating. The diagnostics attempt to use as much access as the user has
available.

A client with ordinary access should be able to diagnose its connection
to the master and run a diagnostic pod. If multiple users or masters are
configured, connections will be tested for all, but the diagnostic pod
only runs against the current user, server, or project.

A client with *cluster-admin* access available (for any user, but only the
current master) should be able to diagnose the status of infrastructure such as
nodes, registry, and router. In each case, running `oc adm diagnostics` looks
for the client configuration in its standard location and uses it if available.

[[ansible-based-tooling-health-checks]]
== Ansible-based Health Checks

// tag::ansible-based-health-checks-intro[]
Additional diagnostic health checks are available through the
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[Ansible-based tooling] used to install and manage {product-title} clusters. They can report
common deployment problems for the current {product-title} installation.

These checks can be run either using the `ansible-playbook` command (the same
method used during
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[Advanced Installation]) or as a link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/blob/master/README_CONTAINER_IMAGE.md[containerized version] of *openshift-ansible*. For the `ansible-playbook` method, the checks
are provided by the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*atomic-openshift-utils* RPM package.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
xref:../install_config/install/host_preparation.adoc#preparing-for-advanced-installations-origin[*openshift-ansible*]
Git repository.
endif::[]
For the containerized method,
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
the *openshift3/ose-ansible* container image is distributed via the
link:https://registry.access.redhat.com[Red Hat Container Registry].
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
the *openshift/origin-ansible* container image is distributed via Docker Hub.
endif::[]
// end::ansible-based-health-checks-intro[]
Example usage for each method are provided in subsequent sections.

The following health checks are a set of diagnostic tasks that are meant to be
run against the Ansible inventory file for a deployed {product-title} cluster
using the provided *_health.yml_* playbook.

[WARNING]
====
Due to potential changes the health check playbooks could make to hosts, they
should only be used on clusters that have been deployed using Ansible and using
the same inventory file with which it was deployed. Changes mostly involve
installing dependencies so that the checks can gather required information, but
it is possible for certain system components (for example, `docker` or
networking) to be altered if their current state differs from the configuration
in the inventory file. Only run these health checks if you would not expect your
inventory file to make any changes to your current cluster configuration.

.Diagnostic Health Checks
[options="header"]
|===

|Check Name |Purpose

|`etcd_imagedata_size`
|This check measures the total size of {product-title} image data in an etcd
cluster. The check fails if the calculated size exceeds a user-defined limit. If
no limit is specified, this check will fail if the size of image data amounts to
50% or more of the currently used space in the etcd cluster.

A failure from this check indicates that a significant amount of space in etcd
is being taken up by {product-title} image data, which can eventually result in
your etcd cluster crashing.

A user-defined limit may be set by passing the `etcd_max_image_data_size_bytes`
variable. For example, setting `etcd_max_image_data_size_bytes=40000000000` will
cause the check to fail if the total size of image data stored in etcd
exceeds 40 GB.

|`etcd_traffic`
|This check detects higher-than-normal traffic on an etcd host. It fails if a
`journalctl` log entry with an etcd sync duration warning is found.

For further information on improving etcd performance, see
xref:../scaling_performance/host_practices.adoc#scaling-performance-capacity-host-practices-etcd[Recommended Practices for {product-title} etcd Hosts] and the
link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2916381[Red Hat Knowledgebase].

|`etcd_volume`
|This check ensures that the volume usage for an etcd cluster is below a maximum
user-specified threshold. If no maximum threshold value is specified, it is
defaulted to `90%` of the total volume size.

A user-defined limit may be set by passing the
`etcd_device_usage_threshold_percent` variable.

|`docker_storage`
|Only runs on hosts that depend on the *docker* daemon (nodes and containerized
installations). Checks that *docker*'s total usage does not exceed a
user-defined limit. If no user-defined limit is set, *docker*'s maximum usage
threshold defaults to 90% of the total size available.

The threshold limit for total percent usage can be set with a variable in your
inventory file, for example `max_thinpool_data_usage_percent=90`.

This also checks that *docker*'s storage is using a
xref:../install_config/registry/deploy_registry_existing_clusters.adoc#storage-for-the-registry[supported configuration].

|`curator`, `elasticsearch`, `fluentd`, `kibana`
|This set of checks verifies that Curator, Kibana, Elasticsearch, and Fluentd
pods have been deployed and are in a `running` state, and that a connection can
be established between the control host and the exposed Kibana URL. These checks
will only run if the `openshift_logging_install_logging` inventory variable is set
to `true`, to ensure that they are executed in a deployment where
xref:../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#install-config-aggregate-logging[cluster logging] has been enabled.

|`logging_index_time`
|This check detects higher than normal time delays between log creation and log
aggregation by Elasticsearch in a logging stack deployment. It fails if a new
log entry cannot be queried through Elasticsearch within a timeout (by default,
30 seconds). The check only runs if logging is enabled.

A user-defined timeout may be set by passing the
`openshift_check_logging_index_timeout_seconds` variable. For example, setting
`openshift_check_logging_index_timeout_seconds=45` will cause the check to fail
if a newly-created log entry is not able to be queried via Elasticsearch after
45 seconds.

|===

[NOTE]
====
A similar set of checks meant to run as part of the installation process can be
found in
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#configuring-cluster-pre-install-checks[Configuring Cluster Pre-install Checks]. Another set of checks for checking certificate
expiration can be found in
xref:../install_config/redeploying_certificates.adoc#install-config-redeploying-certificates[Redeploying Certificates].

[[admin-guide-health-checks-via-ansible-playbook]]
=== Running Health Checks via ansible-playbook

To run the *openshift-ansible* health checks using the `ansible-playbook`
command, specify your cluster's inventory file and run the *_health.yml_*
playbook:

----
# ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> \
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-checks/health.yml
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
    ~/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-checks/health.yml
endif::[]
----

To set variables in the command line, include the `-e` flag with any desired
variables in `key=value` format. For example:

----
# ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> \
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-checks/health.yml
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
    ~/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-checks/health.yml
endif::[]
    -e openshift_check_logging_index_timeout_seconds=45
    -e etcd_max_image_data_size_bytes=40000000000
----

To disable specific checks, include the variable `openshift_disable_check` with
a comma-delimited list of check names in your inventory file before running the
playbook. For example:

----
openshift_disable_check=etcd_traffic,etcd_volume
----

Alternatively, set any checks you want to disable as variables with
`-e openshift_disable_check=<check1>,<check2>` when running the
`ansible-playbook` command.

[[admin-guide-health-checks-via-docker-cli]]
=== Running Health Checks via Docker CLI

It is possible to run the *openshift-ansible* playbooks in a Docker container,
avoiding the need for installing and configuring Ansible, on any host that can
run the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*ose-ansible*
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*origin-ansible*
endif::[]
image via the Docker CLI.

To do so, specify your cluster's inventory file and the *_health.yml_* playbook
when running the following `docker run` command as a non-root user that has
privileges to run containers:

----
# docker run -u `id -u` \ <1>
    -v $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa:/opt/app-root/src/.ssh/id_rsa:Z,ro \ <2>
    -v /etc/ansible/hosts:/tmp/inventory:ro \ <3>
    -e INVENTORY_FILE=/tmp/inventory \
    -e PLAYBOOK_FILE=playbooks/openshift-checks/health.yml \ <4>
    -e OPTS="-v -e openshift_check_logging_index_timeout_seconds=45 -e etcd_max_image_data_size_bytes=40000000000" \ <5>
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
    openshift3/ose-ansible
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
    openshift/origin-ansible
endif::[]
----
<1> These options make the container run with the same UID as the current user,
which is required for permissions so that the SSH key can be read inside the
container (SSH private keys are expected to be readable only by their owner).
<2> Mount SSH keys as a volume under *_/opt/app-root/src/.ssh_* under normal usage
when running the container as a non-root user.
<3> Change *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* to the location of your cluster's inventory file,
if different. This file will be bind-mounted to *_/tmp/inventory_*, which is
used according to the `INVENTORY_FILE` environment variable in the container.
<3> The `PLAYBOOK_FILE` environment variable is set to the location of the
*_health.yml_* playbook relative to *_/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible_*
inside the container.
<4> Set any variables desired for a single run with the `-e key=value` format.

In the above command, the SSH key is mounted with the `:Z` flag so that the
container can read the SSH key from its restricted SELinux context; this means
that your original SSH key file will be relabeled to something like
`system_u:object_r:container_file_t:s0:c113,c247`. For more details about `:Z`,
see the `docker-run(1)` man page.

Keep this in mind for these volume mount specifications ￼because it could have
unexpected consequences. For example, if you mount (and ￼therefore relabel) your
*_$HOME/.ssh_* directory, *sshd* will become unable to access your public keys
to allow remote login. To avoid altering the original file labels, mounting a
copy of the SSH key (or directory) is recommended.

You might want to mount an entire *_.ssh_* directory for various reasons. For
example, this would allow you to use an SSH configuration to match keys with
hosts or modify other connection parameters. It would also allow you to provide
a *_known_hosts_* file and have SSH validate host keys, which is disabled by the
default configuration and can be re-enabled with an environment variable by
adding `-e ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=True` to the `docker` command line.
