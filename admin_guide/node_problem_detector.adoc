== Overview

The Node Problem Detector monitors the health of your nodes
by finding certain problems and reporting these problems to the API server.
The detector runs as a daemonset on each node.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Node Problem Detector is a Technology Preview feature
only.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to
upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide
feedback during the development process.

For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features support scope, see
https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.
endif::[]
====

The Node Problem Detector reads system logs and watches for specific entries and makes these problems visible to the control plane,
which you can view using {product-title} commands, such as `oc get node` and `oc get event`. 
You could then take action to correct these problems as appropriate or capture the messages using a tool of your choice, 
such as the {product-title} xref:../security/monitoring.adoc#security-monitoring[log monitoring].

Detected problems can be in one of the following categories:

* `NodeCondition`: A permanent problem that makes the node unavailable for pods. 
The node condition will not be cleared until the host is rebooted.
* `Event`: A temporary problem that has limited impact on a node, but is informative.

The Node Problem Detector can detect:

* container runtime issues:
** unresponsive runtime daemons

* hardware issues:
** bad CPU 
** bad memory
** bad disk

* kernel issues:
** kernel deadlock conditions
** corrupted file systems
** unresponsive runtime daemons

* infrastructure daemon issues: 
** NTP service outages

== Example Node Problem Detector Output

The following examples show output from the Node Problem Detector watching for kernel deadlock node condition on a specific node. The command 
uses `oc get node` to watch a specific node filtering for a `KernelDeadlock` entry in a log. 

----
# oc get node <node> -o yaml | grep -B5 KernelDeadlock
----

.Sample Node Problem Detector output with no issues 
----
message: kernel has no deadlock
reason: KernelHasNoDeadlock
status: false
type: KernelDeadLock
----

.Sample output for KernelDeadLock condition
----
message: task docker:1234 blocked for more than 120 seconds
reason: DockerHung
status: true
type: KernelDeadLock
----

This example shows output from the Node Problem Detector watching for events on a node.
The following command uses `oc get event` against the *default* project watching for 
events listed in the `kernel-monitor.json` section of the 
xref:admin-guide-node-problem-detector-sample[Node Problem Detector configuration map].

----
# oc get event -n default --field-selector=source=kernel-monitor --watch

[[admin-guide-node-problem-detector-install]]
== Installing the Node Problem Detector

If `openshift_node_problem_detector_install` was set to `true` in the *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* inventory file, 
the xref:../install/index.adoc#install-planning[installation] creates 
a Node Problem Detector daemonset by default and creates a project for the detector, called `openshift-node-problem-detector`. 

[NOTE]
====
Because the Node Problem Detector is in Technology Preview, the `openshift_node_problem_detector_install` is set to `false` by default.
You must manually change the parameter to `true` when installing the Node Problem Detector.
====  

If xref:admin-guide-node-problem-detector-verify[the Node Problem Detector is not installed], run the *openshift-node-problem-detector/config.yml* playbook to install Node Problem Detector: 

----
# ansible-playbook /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-node-problem-detector/config.yml

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/monitor-node-health/#node-problem-detector
The Node Problem Detector supports file-based kernel logging. However, it is easy to extend it to support other log formats.
////

To configure the Node Problem Detector, add or remove problem conditions and events.

. Edit the Node Problem Detector configuration map with a text editor.
+
[source,bash]
----
oc edit configmap -n openshift-node-problem-detector node-problem-detector
----

. Remove, add, or edit any node conditions or events as needed. 
+
[source,yaml]
----
{
       "type": <`temporary` or `permanent`>,
       "reason": <free-form text describing the error>,
       "pattern": <log message to watch for>
},
----
+
For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
{
       "type": "temporary",
       "reason": "UnregisterNetDevice",
       "pattern": "unregister_netdevice: waiting for \\w+ to become free. Usage count = \\d+"
},
----

. Restart running pods to apply the changes. To restart pods, you can delete all existing pods:
+
[source,bash]
----
# oc delete pods -n openshift-node-problem-detector -l name=node-problem-detector
----

. To display Node Problem Detector output to standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr)
