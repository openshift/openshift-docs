== Overview

To provide more reliable scheduling and minimize node resource overcommitment,
each node can reserve a portion of its resources for use by all underlying
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#node[node
components] (e.g., kubelet, kube-proxy, Docker) and the remaining system
components (e.g., *sshd*, *NetworkManager*) on the host. Once specified, the
scheduler has more information about the resources (e.g., memory, CPU) a node
has allocated for pods.

[[allocating-node-settings]]
== Configuring Nodes for Allocated Resources

Resources reserved for node components are based on two node settings: `kube-reserved` and `system-reserved`.

You can use the `kube-reserved` setting to reserve a portion of memory dedicated for kubelet and the `system-reserved` setting for the rest of the system processes. 

[NOTE]
====
Use caution when setting these paramters. Enforcing `kube-reserved` and `system-reserved` limits
can lead to critical system services being CPU starved or OOM killed on the node. For more information
on the effects of these settings, see xref:computing-allocated-resources[Computing Allocated Resources].
====

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===

|Setting |Description

|`*kube-reserved*`
| Resources reserved for node resources, such as kubelet, the Docker daemon, SkyDNS, and kube-proxy. Default is none.

|`*system-reserved*`
| Resources reserved for the remaining system components. Default is none.
|===

You can see which services are controlled by `system-reserved`  with a tool such as libcgroup:
+
----
$ yum install libcgroup-tools 
$ lscgroup memory:/system.slice
----

You can set these in the `*kubeletArguments*` section of the
xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#modifying-nodes[node
configuration map] by using a set of `<resource_type>=<resource_quantity>` pairs 
(e.g., *cpu=200m,memory=512Mi*). Add the section if it does not already exist:

.Node Allocatable Resources Settings
====
[source,yaml]
----
kubeletArguments:
  kube-reserved:
    - "cpu=200m,memory=512Mi"
  system-reserved:
    - "cpu=200m,memory=512Mi"
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Do not edit the `node-config.yaml` file directly.
==== 

To determine appropriate values for these settings, introspect corresponding node's resource usage using the node summary API.
For more information, see xref:system-resources-reported-by-node[System Resources Reported by Node].

After making initial settings: 

* Monitor memory usage for node service for high-water marks. 
+
----
$ ps aux | grep <service-name>
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ ps aux | grep atomic-openshift-node

USER       PID   %CPU  %MEM  VSZ     RSS  TTY    STAT  START  TIME  COMMAND
root       11089 11.5  0.3   112712  996  pts/1  R+    16:23  0:00  grep --color=auto atomic-openshift-node
----
+
If this value is close to your `kube-reserved` mark, you can increase the `kube-reserved` value. 

* Monitor memory usage for system services with a tool such as libcgroup:
+
----
$ yum install libcgroup-tools
$ cgget -g memory  /system.slice | grep memory.usage_in_bytes
----
+
If this value is close to your `system-reserved` mark, you can increase the `system-reserved` value. 

{product-title} currently supports the `*cpu*` and `*memory*` resource types. If
your administrator enabled the ephemeral storage technology preview, the
`*ephemeral-resource*` resource type is supported as well. For `*cpu*`, the
resource quantity is specified in units of cores, such as `200m`, `0.5`, or `1`.
For `*memory*` and `*ephemeral-storage*`, it is specified in units of bytes,
such as `200Ki`, `50Mi`, or `5Gi`.

The ephemeral storage management feature is disabled by default. To enable this
feature, see xref:../install_config/configuring_ephemeral.adoc#install-config-configuring-ephemeral-storage[configuring for
ephemeral storage].

See xref:../dev_guide/compute_resources.adoc#dev-guide-compute-resources[Compute Resources] for more
details.

If a flag is not set, it defaults to *0*. If none of the flags are set, the
allocated resource is set to the node's capacity as it was before the
introduction of allocatable resources.

[[computing-allocated-resources]]
== Computing Allocated Resources

An allocated amount of a resource is computed based on the following formula:

----
[Allocatable] = [Node Capacity] - [kube-reserved] - [system-reserved] - [Hard-Eviction-Thresholds]
----

[NOTE]
====
The withholding of `Hard-Eviction-Thresholds` from allocatable is a change in behavior to improve
system reliability now that allocatable is enforced for end-user pods at the node level.
The `*experimental-allocatable-ignore-eviction*` setting is available to preserve legacy behavior,
but it will be deprecated in a future release.
====


If `[Allocatable]` is negative, it is set to *0*.

[[viewing-node-allocatable-resources-and-capacity]]
== Viewing Node Allocatable Resources and Capacity

To see a node's current capacity and allocatable resources, you can run:

====
----
$ oc get node/<node_name> -o yaml
...
status:
...
  allocatable:
    cpu: "4"
    memory: 8010948Ki
    pods: "110"
  capacity:
    cpu: "4"
    memory: 8010948Ki
    pods: "110"
...

[[system-resources-reported-by-node]]
== System Resources Reported by Node

Each node reports system resources utilized by the container runtime and kubelet.
To better aid your ability to configure `*--system-reserved*` and `*--kube-reserved*`,
you can introspect corresponding node's resource usage using the node summary API,
which is accessible at *_<master>/api/v1/nodes/<node>/proxy/stats/summary_*.

For instance, to access the resources from *cluster.node22* node, you can run:

----
$ curl <certificate details> https://<master>/api/v1/nodes/cluster.node22/proxy/stats/summary
{
    "node": {
        "nodeName": "cluster.node22",
        "systemContainers": [
            {
                "cpu": {
                    "usageCoreNanoSeconds": 929684480915,
                    "usageNanoCores": 190998084
                },
                "memory": {
                    "rssBytes": 176726016,

                    "workingSetBytes": 1050509312
                },
                "name": "kubelet"
            },
            {
                "cpu": {
                    "usageCoreNanoSeconds": 128521955903,
                    "usageNanoCores": 5928600
                },

[[node-enforcement]]
== Node enforcement

The node is able to limit the total amount of resources that pods
may consume based on the configured allocatable value.  This feature significantly
improves the reliability of the node by preventing pods from starving
system services (for example: container runtime, node agent, etc.) for resources.
It is strongly encouraged that administrators reserve
resources based on the desired node utilization target
in order to improve node reliability.

The node enforces resource constraints using a new cgroup hierarchy
that enforces quality of service.  All pods are launched in a
dedicated cgroup hierarchy separate from system daemons.

To configure this ability, the following kubelet arguments are provided.

.Node Cgroup Settings
====
[source,yaml]
----
kubeletArguments:
  cgroups-per-qos:
    - "true" <1>
  cgroup-driver:
    - "systemd" <2>
  enforce-node-allocatable:
    - "pods" <3>
----
<1> Enable or disable the new cgroup hierarchy managed by the node.  Any change
of this setting requires a full drain of the node.  This flag must be true to allow the node to
enforce node allocatable.  We do not recommend users change this value.
<2> The cgroup driver used by the node when managing cgroup hierarchies.  This
value must match the driver associated with the container runtime.  Valid values
are `systemd` and `cgroupfs`.  The default is `systemd`.
<3> A comma-delimited list of scopes for where the node should enforce node
resource constraints.  Valid values are `pods`, `system-reserved`, and `kube-reserved`.
The default is `pods`.  We do not recommend users change this value.
====

Optionally, the node can be made to enforce kube-reserved and system-reserved by
specifying those tokens in the enforce-node-allocatable flag.  If specified, the
corresponding `--kube-reserved-cgroup` or `--system-reserved-cgroup` needs to be provided.
In future releases, the node and container runtime will be packaged in a common cgroup
separate from `system.slice`.  Until that time, we do not recommend users
change the default value of enforce-node-allocatable flag.

Administrators should treat system daemons similar to Guaranteed pods.  System daemons
can burst within their bounding control groups and this behavior needs to be managed
as part of cluster deployments.  Enforcing system-reserved limits
can lead to critical system services being CPU starved or OOM killed on the node. The
recommendation is to enforce system-reserved only if operators have profiled their nodes
exhaustively to determine precise estimates and are confident in their ability to
recover if any process in that group is OOM killed.

As a result, we strongly recommended that users only enforce node allocatable for
`pods` by default, and set aside appropriate reservations for system daemons to maintain
overall node reliability.

[[eviction-thresholds]]
== Eviction Thresholds

If a node is under memory pressure, it can impact the entire node and all pods running on
it.  If a system daemon is using more than its reserved amount of memory, an OOM
event may occur that can impact the entire node and all pods running on it.  To avoid
(or reduce the probability of) system OOMs the node
provides xref:../admin_guide/out_of_resource_handling.adoc#admin-guide-handling-out-of-resource-errors[Out Of Resource Handling].

By reserving some memory via the `--eviction-hard` flag, the node attempts to evict
pods whenever memory availability on the node drops below the absolute value or percentage.
If system daemons did not exist on a node, pods are limited to the memory
`capacity - eviction-hard`. For this reason, resources set aside as a buffer for eviction
before reaching out of memory conditions are not available for pods.

Here is an example to illustrate the impact of node allocatable for memory:

* Node capacity is `32Gi`
* --kube-reserved is `2Gi`
* --system-reserved is `1Gi`
* --eviction-hard is set to `<100Mi`.

For this node, the effective node allocatable value is `28.9Gi`. If the node
and system components use up all their reservation, the memory available for pods is `28.9Gi`,
and kubelet will evict pods when it exceeds this usage.

If we enforce node allocatable (`28.9Gi`) via top level cgroups, then pods can never exceed `28.9Gi`.
Evictions would not be performed unless system daemons are consuming more than `3.1Gi` of memory.

If system daemons do not use up all their reservation, with the above example,
pods would face memcg OOM kills from their bounding cgroup before node evictions kick in.
To better enforce QoS under this situation, the node applies the hard eviction thresholds to
the top-level cgroup for all pods to be `Node Allocatable + Eviction Hard Thresholds`.

If system daemons do not use up all their reservation, the node will evict pods whenever
they collectively consume more than `28.9Gi` of memory. If eviction does not occur in time, a pod
will be OOM killed if pods collectively consume `29Gi` of memory.

[[allocating-node-scheduler]]
== Scheduler

The scheduler now uses the value of `*node.Status.Allocatable*` instead of
`*node.Status.Capacity*` to decide if a node will become a candidate for pod
scheduling.

By default, the node will report its machine capacity as fully schedulable by
the cluster.
