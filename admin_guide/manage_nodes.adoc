== Overview
You can manage
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#node[nodes]
in your instance using the xref:../cli_reference/index.adoc#cli-reference-index[CLI].

When you perform node management operations, the CLI interacts with
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#node-object-definition[node objects]
that are representations of actual node hosts. The
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master[master]
uses the information from node objects to validate nodes with
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#node[health checks].

[[listing-nodes]]
== Listing nodes
To list all nodes that are known to the master:

To list only information about a single node, replace `<node>` with the full
node name:

----
$ oc get node <node>
----

The `STATUS` column in the output of these commands can show nodes with the
following conditions:

.Node Conditions [[node-conditions]]
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Condition |Description

|`Ready`
|The node is passing the health checks performed from the master by returning
`StatusOK`.

|`NotReady`
|The node is not passing the health checks performed from the master.

|`SchedulingDisabled`
|Pods cannot be xref:marking-nodes-as-unschedulable-or-schedulable[scheduled
for placement] on the node.

|===

NOTE: The `STATUS` column can also show `Unknown` for a node if the CLI cannot
find any node condition.

To get more detailed information about a specific node, including the reason for
the current condition:

----
$ oc describe node <node>

[[viewing-nodes]]
== Viewing nodes

You can display usage statistics about nodes, which provide the runtime
environments for containers. These usage statistics include CPU, memory, and
storage consumption.

To view the usage statistics:

----
$ oc adm top nodes
NAME       CPU(cores)   CPU%      MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%
node-1     297m         29%       4263Mi          55%
node-0     55m          5%        1201Mi          15%
infra-1    85m          8%        1319Mi          17%
infra-0    182m         18%       2524Mi          32%
master-0   178m         8%        2584Mi          16%
----

To view the usage statistics for nodes with labels:

----
$ oc adm top node --selector=''
----

You must choose the selector (label query) to filter on. Supports `=`, `==`, and `!=`.

[NOTE]
====
You must have `cluster-reader` permission to view the usage statistics.

[[deleting-nodes]]
== Deleting nodes

When you delete a node using the CLI, the node object is deleted in Kubernetes,
but the pods that exist on the node itself are not deleted. Any bare pods not
backed by a replication controller would be inaccessible to {product-title},
pods backed by replication controllers would be rescheduled to other available
nodes, and
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#node-configuration-files[local
manifest pods] would need to be manually deleted.

To delete a node from the {product-title} cluster:

. xref:evacuating-pods-on-nodes[Evacuate pods] from the node you are preparing
to delete.

. Delete the node object:
+
----
$ oc delete node <node>
----

. Check that the node has been removed from the node list:
+
----
$ oc get nodes
----
+
Pods should now be only scheduled for the remaining nodes that are in *Ready*
state.

. If you want to uninstall all {product-title} content from the node host,
including all pods and containers, continue to
xref:../install/uninstalling_cluster.adoc#uninstalling-nodes[Uninstalling
Nodes] and follow the procedure using the *_uninstall.yml_* playbook. The
procedure assumes general understanding of the
xref:../install/index.adoc#install-config-[cluster installation
process] using Ansible.

[[updating-labels-on-nodes]]
== Updating labels on nodes

To add or update
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[labels] on a
node:

----
$ oc label node <node> <key_1>=<value_1> ... <key_n>=<value_n>
----

To see more detailed usage:

----
$ oc label -h
----

[[listing-pods-on-nodes]]
== Listing pods on nodes
To list all or selected pods on one or more nodes:

----
$ oc adm manage-node <node1> <node2> \
    --list-pods [--pod-selector=<pod_selector>] [-o json|yaml]
----

To list all or selected pods on selected nodes:

----
$ oc adm manage-node --selector=<node_selector> \
    --list-pods [--pod-selector=<pod_selector>] [-o json|yaml]
----

[[marking-nodes-as-unschedulable-or-schedulable]]
== Marking nodes as unschedulable or schedulable

By default, healthy nodes with a `Ready` xref:node-conditions[status] are
marked as schedulable, meaning that new pods are allowed for placement on the
node. Manually marking a node as unschedulable blocks any new pods from being
scheduled on the node. Existing pods on the node are not affected.

To mark a node or nodes as unschedulable:

----
$ oc adm manage-node <node1> <node2> --schedulable=false
----

For example:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc adm manage-node node1.example.com --schedulable=false
NAME                 LABELS                                        STATUS
node1.example.com    kubernetes.io/hostname=node1.example.com      Ready,SchedulingDisabled
----

To mark a currently unschedulable node or nodes as schedulable:

----
$ oc adm manage-node <node1> <node2> --schedulable
----

Alternatively, instead of specifying specific node names (e.g., `<node1>
<node2>`), you can use the `--selector=<node_selector>` option to mark selected
nodes as schedulable or unschedulable.

[[evacuating-pods-on-nodes]]
== Evacuating pods on nodes

Evacuating pods allows you to migrate all or selected pods from a given node.
Nodes must first be xref:marking-nodes-as-unschedulable-or-schedulable[marked unschedulable]
to perform pod evacuation.

Only pods backed by a
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#replication-controllers[replication controller]
can be evacuated; the replication controllers create new pods on other nodes and
remove the existing pods from the specified node(s). Bare pods, meaning those
not backed by a replication controller, are unaffected by default. You can
evacuate a subset of pods by specifying a pod-selector. Pod selector is
based on labels, so all the pods with the specified label will be evacuated.

To evacuate all or selected pods on a node:

----
$ oc adm drain <node> [--pod-selector=<pod_selector>]
----

You can force deletion of bare pods by using the `--force` option. When set to
`true`, deletion continues even if there are pods not managed by a replication
controller, ReplicaSet, job, daemonset, or StatefulSet:

----
$ oc adm drain <node> --force=true
----

You can use `--grace-period` to set a period of time in seconds for each pod to
terminate gracefully. If negative, the default value specified in the pod is
used:

----
$ oc adm drain <node> --grace-period=-1
----

You can use `--ignore-daemonsets` and set it to `true` to ignore
daemonset-managed pods:

----
$ oc adm drain <node> --ignore-daemonsets=true
----

You can use `--timeout` to set the length of time to wait before giving up. A
value of `0` sets an infinite length of time:

----
$ oc adm drain <node> --timeout=5s
----

You can use `--delete-local-data` and set it to `true` to continue deletion even
if there are pods using emptyDir (local data that is deleted when the node is
drained):

----
$ oc adm drain <node> --delete-local-data=true
----

To list objects that will be migrated without actually performing the evacuation,
use the `--dry-run` option and set it to `true`:

----
$ oc adm drain <node> --dry-run=true
----

Instead of specifying a specific node name, you can use the
`--selector=<node_selector>` option to evacuate pods on nodes that match the
selector.

[[rebooting-nodes]]
== Rebooting nodes

To reboot a node without causing an outage for applications running on the
platform, it is important to first xref:evacuating-pods-on-nodes[evacuate the
pods]. For pods that are made highly available by the routing tier, nothing
else needs to be done. For other pods needing storage, typically databases, it
is critical to ensure that they can remain in operation with one pod
temporarily going offline. While implementing resiliency for stateful pods
is different for each application, in all cases it is important to configure
the scheduler to use xref:scheduling/scheduler.adoc#anti-affinity[node anti-affinity] to
ensure that the pods are properly spread across available nodes.

Another challenge is how to handle nodes that are running critical
infrastructure such as the router or the registry. The same node evacuation
process applies, though it is important to understand certain edge cases.

[[infrastructure-nodes]]
=== Infrastructure nodes

Infrastructure nodes are nodes that are labeled to run pieces of the
{product-title} environment. Currently, the easiest way to manage node reboots
is to ensure that there are at least three nodes available to run
infrastructure. The scenario below demonstrates a common mistake that can lead
to service interruptions for the applications running on {product-title} when
only two nodes are available.

- Node A is marked unschedulable and all pods are evacuated.
- The registry pod running on that node is now redeployed on node B. This means
node B is now running both registry pods.
- Node B is now marked unschedulable and is evacuated.
- The service exposing the two pod endpoints on node B, for a brief period of
   time, loses all endpoints until they are redeployed to node A.

The same process using three infrastructure nodes does not result in a service
disruption. However, due to pod scheduling, the last node that is evacuated and
brought back in to rotation is left running zero registries. The other two nodes
will run two and one registries respectively. The best solution is to rely on
pod anti-affinity. This is an alpha feature in Kubernetes that is available for
testing now, but is not yet supported for production workloads.

[[pod-anti-affinity]]
=== Using pod anti-affinity

xref:../admin_guide/scheduling/pod_affinity#admin-guide-sched-pod-affinity[Pod anti-affinity] is slightly different than
xref:../admin_guide/scheduling/node_affinity#admin-guide-sched-affinity[node anti-affinity]. Node anti-affinity can be
violated if there are no other suitable locations to deploy a pod. Pod
anti-affinity can be set to either required or preferred.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: with-pod-antiaffinity
spec:
  affinity:
    podAntiAffinity: <1>
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: <2>

            matchExpressions:
            - key: docker-registry <4>
              operator: In <5>
              values:
              - default
          topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
----

<1> Stanza to configure pod anti-affinity.
<2> Defines a preferred rule.
<3> Specifies a weight for a preferred rule. The node with the highest weight is preferred.
<4> Description of the pod label that determines when the anti-affinity rule applies. Specify a key and value for the label.
<5> The operator represents the relationship between the label on the existing pod and the set of values in the `matchExpression` parameters in the specification for the new pod. Can be `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, or `DoesNotExist`.

This example assumes the container image registry pod has a label of
`*docker-registry=default*`. Pod anti-affinity can use any Kubernetes match
expression.

The last required step is to enable the `*MatchInterPodAffinity*` scheduler
predicate in *_/etc/origin/master/scheduler.json_*. With this in place, if only
two infrastructure nodes are available and one is rebooted, the container image registry
pod is prevented from running on the other node. `*oc get pods*` reports the pod
as unready until a suitable node is available. Once a node is available and all
pods are back in ready state, the next node can be restarted.

[[handling-nodes-running-routers]]
=== Handling nodes running routers

In most cases, a pod running an {product-title} router will expose a host port.
The `*PodFitsPorts*` scheduler predicate ensures that no router pods using the
same port can run on the same node, and pod anti-affinity is achieved. If the
routers are relying on
xref:high_availability.adoc#configuring-ip-failover[IP failover]
for high availability, there is nothing else that is needed. For router pods
relying on an external service such as AWS Elastic Load Balancing for high
availability, it is that service's responsibility to react to router pod
restarts.

In rare cases, a router pod might not have a host port configured. In those cases,
it is important to follow the xref:infrastructure-nodes[recommended restart
process] for infrastructure nodes.

[[modifying-nodes]]
== Modifying Nodes

// tag::node-configmap[]
During installation, {product-title} creates a configmap in the *openshift-node* project for each type of node group:

* node-config-master

* node-config-infra

* node-config-compute

* node-config-all-in-one

* node-config-master-infra

To make configuration changes to an existing node, edit the appropriate configuration map. A _sync pod_ on each node
watches for changes in the configuration maps. During installation, the sync pods are created by using _sync Daemonsets_,
and a *_/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml_* file, where the node configuration parameters reside, is added to each node. When a sync pod
detects configuration map change, it updates the *_node-config.yaml_* on all nodes in that node group and restarts the appropriate nodes.

=== Configuring Node Resources

You can configure node resources by adding kubelet arguments to the node configuration map.

. Edit the configuration map:
+
----
$ oc edit cm node-config-compute -n openshift-node
----

. Add the `*kubeletArguments*` section and specify your options:
+
----
kubeletArguments:
  max-pods: <1>
    - "40"
  resolv-conf: <2>
    - "/etc/resolv.conf"
  image-gc-high-threshold: <3>
    - "90"
  image-gc-low-threshold: <4>
    - "80"
  kube-api-qps: <5>
    - "20"
  kube-api-burst: <6>

[[admin-guide-max-pods-per-node]]
=== Setting maximum pods per node

////
The following section is included in the Scaling and Performance Guide.
////
// tag::admin_guide_manage_nodes[]

[NOTE]
====
See the
xref:../scaling_performance/cluster_maximums.adoc#scaling-performance-current-cluster-maximums[Cluster
maximums] page for the maximum supported limits for each version of
{product-title}.
====

In the *_/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml_* file, two parameters control the
maximum number of pods that can be scheduled to a node: `pods-per-core` and
`max-pods`. When both options are in use, the lower of the two limits the number
of pods on a node. Exceeding these values can result in:

* Increased CPU utilization on both {product-title} and Docker.
* Slow pod scheduling.
* Potential out-of-memory scenarios (depends on the amount of memory in the node).
* Exhausting the pool of IP addresses.
* Resource overcommitting, leading to poor user application performance.

[NOTE]
====
In Kubernetes, a pod that is holding a single container actually uses two
containers. The second container is used to set up networking prior to the
actual container starting. Therefore, a system running 10 pods will actually
have 20 containers running.
====

`pods-per-core` sets the number of pods the node can run based on the number of
processor cores on the node. For example, if `pods-per-core` is set to `10` on
a node with 4 processor cores, the maximum number of pods allowed on the node
will be 40.

----
kubeletArguments:
  pods-per-core:
    - "10"
----

[NOTE]
====
Setting `pods-per-core` to 0 disables this limit.
====

`max-pods` sets the number of pods the node can run to a fixed value, regardless
of the properties of the node.
xref:../scaling_performance/cluster_maximums.adoc#scaling-performance-current-cluster-maximums[Cluster
Limits] documents maximum supported values for `max-pods`.

----
kubeletArguments:
  max-pods:
    - "250"
----

Using the above example, the default value for `pods-per-core` is `10` and the
default value for `max-pods` is `250`. This means that unless the node has 25
cores or more, by default, `pods-per-core` will be the limiting factor.

[[managing-nodes-docker-reset]]
== Resetting Docker storage

As you download container images and run and delete containers, Docker does not always free up mapped disk space. As a result, over time you can run out of space on a node,
which might prevent {product-title} from being able to create new pods or cause pod creation to take several minutes.

For example, the following shows pods that are still in the `ContainerCreating` state after six minutes and the events log shows a xref:../dev_guide/events.adoc#events-reference[FailedSync event].

[source,bash]

One solution to this problem is to reset Docker storage to remove artifacts not needed by Docker.

On the node where you want to restart Docker storage:

. Run the following command to mark the node as unschedulable:
+
----
$ oadm manage-node <node> --schedulable=false
----

. Run the following command to shut down Docker and the *atomic-openshift-node* service:
+
----
$ systemctl stop docker atomic-openshift-node
----

. Run the following command to remove the local volume directory:
+
----
$ rm -rf /var/lib/origin/openshift.local.volumes
----
+
This command clears the local image cache. As a result, images, including `ose-*` images, will need to be re-pulled.
This might result in slower pod start times while the image store recovers.

. Remove the *_/var/lib/docker_* directory:
+
----
$ rm -rf /var/lib/docker
----

. Run the following command to reset the Docker storage:
+
----
$ docker-storage-setup --reset
----

. Run the following command to recreate the Docker storage:
+
----
$ docker-storage-setup
----

. Recreate the *_/var/lib/docker_* directory:
+
----
$ mkdir /var/lib/docker
----

. Run the following command to restart Docker and the *atomic-openshift-node* service:
+
----
$ systemctl start docker atomic-openshift-node
----

. Restart the node service by rebooting the host:
+
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node.service
----

. Run the following command to mark the node as schedulable:
+
----
$ oadm manage-node <node> --schedulable=true
----
