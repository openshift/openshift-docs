== Overview
You can manage
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#node[nodes]
in your instance using the xref:../cli_reference/index.adoc#cli-reference-index[CLI].

When you perform node management operations, the CLI interacts with
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#node-object-definition[node objects]
that are representations of actual node hosts. The
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master[master]
uses the information from node objects to validate nodes with
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#node[health checks].

[[listing-nodes]]
== Listing Nodes
To list all nodes that are known to the master:

====
----
$ oc get nodes
NAME                        STATUS                     AGE
master.example.com          Ready,SchedulingDisabled   165d
node1.example.com           Ready                      165d
node2.example.com           Ready                      165d
----
====

To only list information about a single node, replace `<node>` with the full
node name:

----
$ oc get node <node>
----

The `STATUS` column in the output of these commands can show nodes with the
following conditions:

.Node Conditions [[node-conditions]]
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Condition |Description

|`Ready`
|The node is passing the health checks performed from the master by returning
`StatusOK`.

|`NotReady`
|The node is not passing the health checks performed from the master.

|`SchedulingDisabled`
|Pods cannot be xref:marking-nodes-as-unschedulable-or-schedulable[scheduled
for placement] on the node.

|===

NOTE: The `STATUS` column can also show `Unknown` for a node if the CLI cannot
find any node condition.

To get more detailed information about a specific node, including the reason for
the current condition:

----
$ oc describe node <node>
----

For example:

====
----
$ oc describe node node1.example.com
Name:			node1.example.com
Labels:			kubernetes.io/hostname=node1.example.com

[[adding-nodes]]
== Adding Nodes

To add nodes to your existing {product-title} cluster, you can run an Ansible
playbook that handles installing the node components, generating the required
certificates, and other important steps. See the
xref:../install_config/adding_hosts_to_existing_cluster.adoc#adding-nodes-advanced[advanced
installation] method for instructions on running the playbook directly.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Alternatively, if you used the quick installation method, you can
xref:../install_config/adding_hosts_to_existing_cluster.adoc#adding-nodes-or-reinstalling-quick[re-run
the installer to add nodes], which performs the same steps.
endif::[]

[[deleting-nodes]]
== Deleting Nodes

When you delete a node using the CLI, the node object is deleted in Kubernetes,
but the pods that exist on the node itself are not deleted. Any bare pods not
backed by a replication controller would be inaccessible to {product-title},
pods backed by replication controllers would be rescheduled to other available
nodes, and
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#node-configuration-files[local
manifest pods] would need to be manually deleted.

To delete a node from the {product-title} cluster:

. xref:evacuating-pods-on-nodes[Evacuate pods] from the node you are preparing
to delete.

. Delete the node object:
+
----
$ oc delete node <node>
----

. Check that the node has been removed from the node list:
+
----
$ oc get nodes
----
+
Pods should now be only scheduled for the remaining nodes that are in *Ready*
state.

. If you want to uninstall all {product-title} content from the node host,
including all pods and containers, continue to
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#uninstalling-nodes-advanced[Uninstalling
Nodes] and follow the procedure using the *_uninstall.yml_* playbook. The
procedure assumes general understanding of the
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installation
method] using Ansible.

[[updating-labels-on-nodes]]
== Updating Labels on Nodes

To add or update
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[labels] on a
node:

----
$ oc label node <node> <key_1>=<value_1> ... <key_n>=<value_n>
----

To see more detailed usage:

----
$ oc label -h
----

== Listing Pods on Nodes
To list all or selected pods on one or more nodes:

----
$ oadm manage-node <node1> <node2> \
    --list-pods [--pod-selector=<pod_selector>] [-o json|yaml]
----

To list all or selected pods on selected nodes:

----
$ oadm manage-node --selector=<node_selector> \
    --list-pods [--pod-selector=<pod_selector>] [-o json|yaml]
----

[[marking-nodes-as-unschedulable-or-schedulable]]
== Marking Nodes as Unschedulable or Schedulable

By default, healthy nodes with a `Ready` xref:node-conditions[status] are
marked as schedulable, meaning that new pods are allowed for placement on the
node. Manually marking a node as unschedulable blocks any new pods from being
scheduled on the node. Existing pods on the node are not affected.

To mark a node or nodes as unschedulable:

----
$ oadm manage-node <node1> <node2> --schedulable=false
----

For example:

====
[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oadm manage-node node1.example.com --schedulable=false
NAME                 LABELS                                        STATUS
node1.example.com    kubernetes.io/hostname=node1.example.com      Ready,SchedulingDisabled
----
====

To mark a currently unschedulable node or nodes as schedulable:

----
$ oadm manage-node <node1> <node2> --schedulable
----

Alternatively, instead of specifying specific node names (e.g., `<node1>
<node2>`), you can use the `--selector=<node_selector>` option to mark selected
nodes as schedulable or unschedulable.

[[evacuating-pods-on-nodes]]
== Evacuating Pods on Nodes

Evacuating pods allows you to migrate all or selected pods from a given node or
nodes. Nodes must first be
xref:marking-nodes-as-unschedulable-or-schedulable[marked unschedulable] to
perform pod evacuation.

Only pods backed by a
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#replication-controllers[replication
controller] can be evacuated; the replication controllers create new pods on
other nodes and remove the existing pods from the specified node(s). Bare pods,
meaning those not backed by a replication controller, are unaffected by default.

To list pods that will be migrated without actually performing the evacuation,
use the `--dry-run` option:

----
$ oadm manage-node <node1> <node2> \
    --evacuate --dry-run [--pod-selector=<pod_selector>]
----

To actually evacuate all or selected pods on one or more nodes:

----
$ oadm manage-node <node1> <node2> \
    --evacuate [--pod-selector=<pod_selector>]
----

You can force deletion of bare pods by using the `--force` option:

----
$ oadm manage-node <node1> <node2> \
    --evacuate --force [--pod-selector=<pod_selector>]
----

Alternatively, instead of specifying specific node names (e.g., `<node1>
<node2>`), you can use the `--selector=<node_selector>` option to evacuate pods
on selected nodes.

[[rebooting-nodes]]
== Rebooting Nodes

To reboot a node without causing an outage for applications running on the
platform, it is important to first xref:evacuating-pods-on-nodes[evacuate the
pods]. For pods that are made highly available by the routing tier, nothing
else needs to be done. For other pods needing storage, typically databases, it
is critical to ensure that they can remain in operation with one pod
temporarily going offline. While implementing resiliency for stateful pods
is different for each application, in all cases it is important to configure
the scheduler to use xref:scheduler.adoc#anti-affinity[node anti-affinity] to
ensure that the pods are properly spread across available nodes.

Another challenge is how to handle nodes that are running critical
infrastructure such as the router or the registry. The same node evacuation
process applies, though it is important to understand certain edge cases.

[[infrastructure-nodes]]
=== Infrastructure Nodes

Infrastructure nodes are nodes that are labeled to run pieces of the
{product-title} environment. Currently, the easiest way to manage node reboots
is to ensure that there are at least three nodes available to run
infrastructure. The scenario below demonstrates a common mistake that can lead
to service interruptions for the applications running on {product-title} when
only two nodes are available.

- Node A is marked unschedulable and all pods are evacuated.
- The registry pod running on that node is now redeployed on node B. This means
node B is now running both registry pods.
- Node B is now marked unschedulable and is evacuated.
- The service exposing the two pod endpoints on node B, for a brief period of
   time, loses all endpoints until they are redeployed to node A.

The same process using three infrastructure nodes does not result in a service
disruption. However, due to pod scheduling, the last node that is evacuated and
brought back in to rotation is left running zero registries. The other two nodes
will run two and one registries respectively. The best solution is to rely on
pod anti-affinity. This is an alpha feature in Kubernetes that is available for
testing now, but is not yet supported for production workloads.

[[pod-anti-affinity]]
=== Using Pod Anti-Affinity for the Docker Registry Pod

Pod anti-affinity is slightly different than
xref:scheduler.adoc#anti-affinity[node anti-affinity]. Node anti-affinity can be
violated if there are no other suitable locations to deploy a pod. Pod
anti-affinity can be set to either required or preferred.

Using the `*docker-registry*` pod as an example, the first step in enabling
this feature is to set the `*scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/affinity*` on the
pod. Since this pod uses a deployment configuration, the most appropriate
place to add the annotation is to the pod template's metadata.

====
----
$ oc edit dc/docker-registry -o yaml

...
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/affinity: |
          {
            "podAntiAffinity": {
              "requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution": [{
                "labelSelector": {
                  "matchExpressions": [{
                    "key": "docker-registry",
                    "operator": "In",
                    "values":["default"]
                  }]
                },
                "topologyKey": "kubernetes.io/hostname"
              }]
            }
          }
----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
`*scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/affinity*` is internally stored as a string
even though the contents are JSON. The above example shows how this string can
be added as an annotation to a YAML deployment configuration.
====

This example assumes the Docker registry pod has a label of
`*docker-registry=default*`. Pod anti-affinity can use any Kubernetes match
expression.

The last required step is to enable the `*MatchInterPodAffinity*` scheduler
predicate in *_/etc/origin/master/scheduler.json_*. With this in place, if only
two infrastructure nodes are available and one is rebooted, the Docker registry
pod is prevented from running on the other node. `*oc get pods*` reports the pod
as unready until a suitable node is available. Once a node is available and all
pods are back in ready state, the next node can be restarted.

[[handling-nodes-running-routers]]
=== Handling Nodes Running Routers

In most cases, a pod running an {product-title} router will expose a host port.
The `*PodFitsPorts*` scheduler predicate ensures that no router pods using the
same port can run on the same node, and pod anti-affinity is achieved. If the
routers are relying on
xref:high_availability.adoc#configuring-ip-failover[IP failover]
for high availability, there is nothing else that is needed. For router pods
relying on an external service such as AWS Elastic Load Balancing for high
availability, it is that service's responsibility to react to router pod
restarts.

In rare cases, a router pod may not have a host port configured. In those cases,
it is important to follow the xref:infrastructure-nodes[recommended restart
process] for infrastructure nodes.

[[configuring-node-resources]]
== Configuring Node Resources

You can configure node resources by adding kubelet arguments to the node
configuration file (*_/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml_*). Add the
`*kubeletArguments*` section and include any desired options:

====
----
kubeletArguments:
  max-pods <1>
    - "40"
  resolv-conf <2>
    - "/etc/resolv.conf"
  image-gc-high-threshold: <3>
    - "90"
  image-gc-low-threshold: <4>
    - "80"
----

<1> xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#admin-guide-max-pods-per-node[Maximum number of pods that can run on this kubelet].
<2> Resolver configuration file used as the basis for the container DNS
resolution configuration.
<3> The percent of disk usage after which image garbage collection is always run.
Default: 90%
<4> The percent of disk usage before which image garbage collection is never run.
Lowest disk usage to garbage collect to. Default: 80%
====

To view all available kubelet options:

----
$ kubelet -h
----

This can also be set during an
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#configuring-ansible[advanced
installation] using the `*openshift_node_kubelet_args*` variable. For example:

====
----
openshift_node_kubelet_args={'max-pods': ['40'], 'resolv-conf': ['/etc/resolv.conf'],  'image-gc-high-threshold': ['90'], 'image-gc-low-threshold': ['80']}
----
====

[[admin-guide-max-pods-per-node]]
=== Setting Maximum Pods Per Node

In the *_/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml_* file, two parameters control the
maximum number of pods that can be scheduled to a node: `pods-per-core` and
`max-pods`. When both options are in use, the lower of the two limits the number
of pods on a node.

`pods-per-core` sets the number of pods the node can run based on the number of
processor cores on the node. For example, if `pods-per-core` is set to `10` on
a node with 4 processor cores, the maxiumum number of pods allowed on the node
will be 40.

====
----
kubeletArguments:
  pods-per-core:
    - "10"
----
====

`max-pods` sets the number of pods the node can run to a fixed value, regardless
of the properties of the node.

====
----
kubeletArguments:
  max-pods:
    - "250"
----
====

Using the above example, the default value for `pods-per-core` is `10` and the
default value for `max-pods` is `250`. This means that unless the node has 25
cores or more, by default, `pods-per-core` will be the limiting factor.

[[manage-node-change-node-traffic-interface]]
== Changing Node Traffic Interface

By default, DNS routes all node traffic. During node registration, the master
receives the node IP addresses from the DNS configuration, and therefore
accessing nodes via DNS is the most flexible solution for most deployments.

If your deployment is using a cloud provider, then the node gets the IP
information from the cloud provider. However, *openshift-sdn* attempts to
determine the IP through a variety of methods, including a DNS lookup on the
nodeName (if set), or on the system hostname (if nodeName is not set).

However, you may need to change the node traffic interface. For example,
where:

- {product-title} is installed in a cloud provider where internal hostnames are not configured/resolvable by all hosts.
- The node's IP from the master's perspective is not the same as the node's IP from its own perspective.

Configuring the `*openshift_set_node_ip*` Ansible variable
forces node traffic through an interface other than the default network
interface.

To change the node traffic interface:

. Set the `*openshift_set_node_ip*` Ansible variable to `true`.
. Set the `*openshift_ip*` to the IP address for the node you want to configure.
[NOTE]
====
Although  `*openshift_set_node_ip*` can be useful as a workaround for the
cases stated in this section, it is generally not suited for production
environments. This is because the node will no longer function properly if it
receives a new IP address.
====
