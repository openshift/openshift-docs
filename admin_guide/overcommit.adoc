== Overview

Containers can specify xref:../dev_guide/compute_resources.adoc#dev-guide-compute-resources[compute resource
requests and limits]. Requests are used for scheduling your container and
provide a minimum service guarantee. Limits constrain the amount of compute
resource that may be consumed on your node.

The xref:../admin_guide/scheduling/scheduler.adoc#admin-guide-scheduler[scheduler] attempts
to optimize the compute resource use across all nodes in your cluster. It places
pods onto specific nodes, taking the pods' compute resource requests and nodes'
available capacity into consideration.

Requests and limits enable administrators to allow and manage the overcommitment
of resources on a node, which may be desirable in development environments where
a tradeoff of guaranteed performance for capacity is acceptable.

[[requests-and-limits]]
== Requests and Limits

For each compute resource, a container may specify a resource request and limit.
Scheduling decisions are made based on the request to ensure that a node has
enough capacity available to meet the requested value. If a container specifies
limits, but omits requests, the requests are defaulted to the limits. A
container is not able to exceed the specified limit on the node.

The enforcement of limits is dependent upon the compute resource type. If a
container makes no request or limit, the container is scheduled to a node with
no resource guarantees. In practice, the container is able to consume as much of
the specified resource as is available with the lowest local priority. In low
resource situations, containers that specify no resource requests are given the
lowest quality of service.

[[tune-buffer-chunk-limit]]
=== Tune Buffer Chunk Limit

If Fluentd logger is unable to keep up with a high number of logs, it will need
to switch to file buffering to reduce memory usage and prevent data loss.

The Fluentd `buffer_chunk_limit` is determined by the environment variable
`BUFFER_SIZE_LIMIT`, which has the default value `8m`. The file buffer size per
output is determined by the environment variable `FILE_BUFFER_LIMIT`, which has
the default value `256Mi`. The permanent volume size must be larger than
`FILE_BUFFER_LIMIT` multiplied by the output.

On the Fluentd and Mux pods, permanent volume */var/lib/fluentd* should be
prepared by the PVC or hostmount, for example. That area is then used for the
file buffers.

The `buffer_type` and `buffer_path` are configured in the Fluentd configuration files as
follows:

----
$ egrep "buffer_type|buffer_path" *.conf
output-es-config.conf:
  buffer_type file
  buffer_path `/var/lib/fluentd/buffer-output-es-config`
output-es-ops-config.conf:
  buffer_type file
  buffer_path `/var/lib/fluentd/buffer-output-es-ops-config`
filter-pre-mux-client.conf:
  buffer_type file
  buffer_path `/var/lib/fluentd/buffer-mux-client`
----

The Fluentd `buffer_queue_limit` is 32.

[[compute-resources]]
== Compute Resources

The node-enforced behavior for compute resources is specific to the resource
type.

[[overcommit-cpu]]
=== CPU

A container is guaranteed the amount of CPU it requests and is additionally able
to consume excess CPU available on the node, up to any limit specified by the
container. If multiple containers are attempting to use excess CPU, CPU time is
distributed based on the amount of CPU requested by each container.

For example, if one container requested 500m of CPU time and another container
requested 250m of CPU time, then any extra CPU time available on the node is
distributed among the containers in a 2:1 ratio. If a container specified a
limit, it will be throttled not to use more CPU than the specified limit.

CPU requests are enforced using the CFS shares support in the Linux kernel. By
default, CPU limits are enforced using the CFS quota support in the Linux kernel
over a 100ms measuring interval, though xref:enforcing-cpu-limits[this can be
disabled].

[[overcommit-memory]]
=== Memory

A container is guaranteed the amount of memory it requests. A container may use
more memory than requested, but once it exceeds its requested amount, it could
be killed in a low memory situation on the node.

If a container uses less memory than requested, it will not be killed unless
system tasks or daemons need more memory than was accounted for in the node's
resource reservation. If a container specifies a limit on memory, it is
immediately killed if it exceeds the limit amount.

[[overcommit-ephemeral-storage]]
=== Ephemeral Storage

This applies only if you have enabled the Ephemeral Storage tech
preview in {product-title} 3.10.  This is disabled by default; to
enable this feature, please see
xref:../install_config/configuring_ephemeral.adoc[Configuring for
Ephemeral Storage].

A container is guaranteed the amount of ephemeral storage it
requests. A container may use more ephemeral storage than requested,
but once it exceeds its requested amount, it could be killed in if the
available ephemeral disk space gets too low.

If a container uses less ephemeral storage than requested, it will not
be killed unless system tasks or daemons need more local ephemeral
storage than was accounted for in the node's resource reservation. If
a container specifies a limit on ephemeral storage, it is immediately
killed if it exceeds the limit amount.

[[qos-classes]]
== Quality of Service Classes

A node is _overcommitted_ when it has a pod scheduled that makes no request, or
when the sum of limits across all pods on that node exceeds available machine
capacity.

In an overcommitted environment, it is possible that the pods on the node will
attempt to use more compute resource than is available at any given point in
time. When this occurs, the node must give priority to one pod over another. The
facility used to make this decision is referred to as a Quality of Service (QoS)
Class.

For each compute resource, a container is divided into one of three QoS classes
with decreasing order of priority:

.Quality of Service Classes
[options="header",cols="1,1,5"]
|===
|Priority |Class Name |Description

|1 (highest)
|*Guaranteed*
|If limits and optionally requests are set (not equal to 0) for all resources
and they are equal, then the container is classified as *Guaranteed*.

|2
|*Burstable*
|If requests and optionally limits are set (not equal to 0) for all resources,
and they are not equal, then the container is classified as *Burstable*.

|3 (lowest)
|*BestEffort*
|If requests and limits are not set for any of the resources, then the container
is classified as *BestEffort*.
|===

Memory is an incompressible resource, so in low memory situations, containers
that have the lowest priority are killed first:

- *Guaranteed* containers are considered top priority, and are guaranteed to
only be killed if they exceed their limits, or if the system is under memory
pressure and there are no lower priority containers that can be evicted.
- *Burstable* containers under system memory pressure are more likely to be
killed once they exceed their requests and no other *BestEffort* containers
exist.
- *BestEffort* containers are treated with the lowest priority. Processes in
these containers are first to be killed if the system runs out of memory.

[[configuring-masters-for-overcommitment]]
== Configuring Masters for Overcommitment

Scheduling is based on resources requested, while quota and hard limits refer to
resource limits, which can be set higher than requested resources. The difference
between request and limit determines the level of overcommit; for instance, if a
container is given a memory request of 1Gi and a memory limit of 2Gi, it is
scheduled based on the 1Gi request being available on the node, but could use
up to 2Gi; so it is 200% overcommitted.

If {product-title} administrators would like to control the level of overcommit
and manage container density on nodes, masters can be configured
to override the ratio between request and limit set on developer
containers. In conjunction with a xref:./limits.adoc#admin-guide-limits[per-project
LimitRange] specifying limits and defaults, this adjusts the container
limit and request to achieve the desired level of overcommit.

This requires configuring the `*ClusterResourceOverride*` admission controller in the
*_master-config.yaml_* as in the following example (reuse the existing configuration tree
if it exists, or introduce absent elements as needed):

====
----
  admissionConfig:
    pluginConfig:
      ClusterResourceOverride:   <1>
        configuration:
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: ClusterResourceOverrideConfig
          memoryRequestToLimitPercent: 25  <2>
          cpuRequestToLimitPercent: 25     <3>
          limitCPUToMemoryPercent: 200     <4>
----
<1> This is the plug-in name; case matters and anything but an exact match for a plug-in name is ignored.
<2> (optional, 1-100) If a container memory limit has been specified or defaulted, the memory request is overridden to this percentage of the limit.
<3> (optional, 1-100) If a container CPU limit has been specified or defaulted, the CPU request is overridden to this percentage of the limit.
<4> (optional, positive integer) If a container memory limit has been specified or defaulted, the CPU limit is overridden to a percentage of the memory limit, with a 100 percentage scaling 1Gi of RAM to equal 1 CPU core. This is processed prior to overriding CPU request (if configured).
====

After changing the master configuration, a master restart is required.

Note that these overrides have no effect if no limits have
been set on containers. xref:./limits.adoc#admin-guide-limits[Create a LimitRange
object] with default limits (per individual project, or in the
xref:./managing_projects.adoc#modifying-the-template-for-new-projects[project
template]) in order to ensure that the overrides apply.

Note also that after overrides, the container limits and requests must still
be validated by any LimitRange objects in the project. It is possible,
for example, for developers to specify a limit close to the minimum
limit, and have the request then be overridden below the minimum limit,
causing the pod to be forbidden. This unfortunate user experience should
be addressed with future work, but for now, configure this capability
and LimitRanges with caution.

When configured, overrides can be disabled per-project (for example,
to allow infrastructure components to be configured independently of
overrides) by editing the project and adding the following annotation:

----
quota.openshift.io/cluster-resource-override-enabled: "false"
----

[[configuring-nodes-for-overcommitment]]
== Configuring Nodes for Overcommitment

In an overcommitted environment, it is important to properly configure your node
to provide best system behavior.

[[configuring-reserve-resources]]
=== Reserving Memory Across Quality of Service Tiers

You can use the `experimental-qos-reserved` parameter to specify a percentage of memory to be reserved
by a pod in a particular QoS level.  This feature attempts to reserve requested resources to exclude pods
from lower OoS classes from using resources requested by pods in higher QoS classes.

By reserving resources for higher QOS levels, pods that don't have resource limits are prevented from encroaching on the resources
requested by pods at higher QoS levels.

To configure `experimental-qos-reserved`, edit the *_/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml_* file for the node.

----
kubeletArguments:
  cgroups-per-qos:
  - true
  cgroup-driver:
  - 'systemd'
  cgroup-root:
  - '/'
  experimental-qos-reserved: <1>
  - 'memory=50%'
----

<1> Specifies how pod resource requests are reserved at the QoS level.

{product-title} uses the `experimental-qos-reserved` parameter as follows:

- A value of `experimental-qos-reserved=memory=100%` will prevent the `Burstable` and `BestEffort` QOS classes from consuming memory
that was requested by a higher QoS class. This increases the risk of inducing OOM
on `BestEffort` and `Burstable` workloads in favor of increasing memory resource guarantees
for `Guaranteed` and `Burstable` workloads.

- A value of `experimental-qos-reserved=memory=50%` will allow the `Burstable` and `BestEffort` QOS classes
to consume half of the memory requested by a higher QoS class.

- A value of `experimental-qos-reserved=memory=0%`
will allow a `Burstable` and `BestEffort` QoS classes to consume up to the full node
allocatable amount if available, but increases the risk that a `Guaranteed` workload
will not have access to requested memory. This condition effectively disables this feature.


[[enforcing-cpu-limits]]
=== Enforcing CPU Limits

Nodes by default enforce specified CPU limits using the CPU CFS quota support in
the Linux kernel. If you do not want to enforce CPU limits on the node, you can
disable its enforcement by modifying the
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#install-config-master-node-configuration[node configuration file]
(the *_node-config.yaml_* file) to include the following:

====
----
kubeletArguments:
  cpu-cfs-quota:
    - "false"
----
====

If CPU limit enforcement is disabled, it is important to understand the impact that will have on your node:

- If a container makes a request for CPU, it will continue to be enforced by CFS
shares in the Linux kernel.
- If a container makes no explicit request for CPU, but it does specify a limit,
the request will default to the specified limit, and be enforced by CFS shares
in the Linux kernel.
- If a container specifies both a request and a limit for CPU, the request will
be enforced by CFS shares in the Linux kernel, and the limit will have no
impact on the node.

[[reserving-resources-for-system-processes]]
=== Reserving Resources for System Processes

The xref:../admin_guide/scheduling/scheduler.adoc#admin-guide-scheduler[scheduler] ensures that there are enough
resources for all pods on a node based on the pod requests. It verifies that the
sum of requests of containers on the node is no greater than the node capacity.
It includes all containers started by the node, but not containers or processes
started outside the knowledge of the cluster.

It is recommended that you reserve some portion of the node capacity to allow
for the system daemons that are required to run on your node for your cluster to
function (*sshd*, *docker*, etc.). In particular, it is recommended that you
reserve resources for incompressible resources such as memory.

If you want to explicitly reserve resources for non-pod processes, there are two
ways to do so:

- The preferred method is to allocate node resources by specifying resources
available for scheduling. See
xref:../admin_guide/allocating_node_resources.adoc#admin-guide-allocating-node-resources[Allocating Node Resources]
for more details.

- Alternatively, you can create a *resource-reserver* pod that does nothing but
reserve capacity from being scheduled on the node by the cluster. For example:
+
.*resource-reserver* Pod Definition
====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: resource-reserver
spec:
  containers:
  - name: sleep-forever
    image: gcr.io/google_containers/pause:0.8.0
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 100m <1>
        memory: 150Mi <2>
----
<1> The amount of CPU to reserve on a node for host-level daemons unknown to the
cluster.
<2> The amount of memory to reserve on a node for host-level daemons unknown to
the cluster.
====
+
You can save your definition to a file, for example *_resource-reserver.yaml_*,
then place the file in the node configuration directory, for example
*_/etc/origin/node/_* or the `--config=<dir>` location if otherwise specified.
+
Additionally, the node server needs to be configured to read
the definition from the node configuration directory,
by naming the directory in the `kubeletArguments.config` field of the
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#install-config-master-node-configuration[node configuration file]
(usually named *_node-config.yaml_*):
+
====
----
kubeletArguments:
  config:
    - "/etc/origin/node"  <1>
----
<1> If `--config=<dir>` is specified, use `<dir>` here.
====
+
With the *_resource-reserver.yaml_* file in place,
starting the node server also launches the *sleep-forever* container.
The scheduler takes into account the remaining capacity of the node,
adjusting where to place cluster pods accordingly.
+
To remove the *resource-reserver* pod, you can delete or move
the *_resource-reserver.yaml_* file from the node configuration directory.

[[kernel-tunable-flags]]
=== Kernel Tunable Flags

When the node starts, it ensures that the kernel tunable flags for memory
management are set properly. The kernel should never fail memory allocations
unless it runs out of physical memory.

To ensure this behavior, the node instructs the kernel to always overcommit
memory:

----
$ sysctl -w vm.overcommit_memory=1
----

The node also instructs the kernel not to panic when it runs out of memory.
Instead, the kernel OOM killer should kill processes based on priority:

----
$ sysctl -w vm.panic_on_oom=0
----

[NOTE]
====
The above flags should already be set on nodes, and no further action is
required.
====

[[disabling-swap-memory]]
=== Disabling Swap Memory

You can disable swap by default on your nodes in order to preserve quality of
service guarantees. Otherwise, physical resources on a node can oversubscribe,
affecting the resource guarantees the Kubernetes scheduler makes during pod
placement.

For example, if two guaranteed pods have reached their memory limit, each
container could start using swap memory. Eventually, if there is not enough swap
space, processes in the pods can be terminated due to the system being
oversubscribed.

To disable swap:

----
$ swapoff -a
----

Failing to disable swap results in nodes not recognizing that they are
experiencing *MemoryPressure*, resulting in pods not receiving the memory they
made in their scheduling request. As a result, additional pods are placed on the
node to further increase memory pressure, ultimately increasing your risk of
experiencing a system out of memory (OOM) event.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If swap is enabled, any
xref:../admin_guide/out_of_resource_handling.adoc#admin-guide-handling-out-of-resource-errors[out
of resource handling] eviction thresholds for available memory will not work as
expected. Take advantage of out of resource handling to allow pods to be evicted
from a node when it is under memory pressure, and rescheduled on an alternative
node that has no such pressure.
====
