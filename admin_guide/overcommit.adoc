== Overview

Containers can specify link:../dev_guide/compute_resources.html[compute resource
requests and limits]. Requests are used for scheduling your container and
provide a minimum service guarantee. Limits constrain the amount of compute
resource that may be consumed on your node.

The link:../admin_guide/scheduler.html[scheduler] attempts to improve the
utilization of compute resources across all nodes in the cluster. It places pods
on nodes relative to the pods' compute resource requests to find a node that
provides the best fit.

Requests and limits enable administrators to allow and manage the overcommitment
of resources on a node, which may be desirable in development environments where
performance is not a concern.

[[requests-and-limits]]
== Requests and Limits

For each compute resource, a container may specify a resource request and limit.
Scheduling decisions are made based on the request to ensure that a node has
enough capacity available to meet the requested value. If a container specifies
limits, but omits requests, the requests are defaulted to the limits. A
container is not able to exceed the specified limit on the node.

The enforcement of limits is dependent upon the compute resource type. If a
container makes no request or limit, the container is scheduled to a node with
no resource guarantees. In practice, the container is able to consume as much of
the specified resource as is available with the lowest local priority. In low
resource situations, containers that specify no resource requests are given the
lowest quality of service.

[[compute-resources]]
== Compute Resources

The node-enforced behavior for compute resources is specific to the resource
type.

[[overcommit-cpu]]
=== CPU

A container is guaranteed the amount of CPU it requests, but it may or may not
get more CPU time based on local node conditions. If a container does not
specify a corresponding limit, it is able to consume excess CPU available on the
node. If multiple containers are attempting to use excess CPU, CPU time is
distributed based on the amount of CPU requested by each container.

For example, if one container requested 500m of CPU time, and another container
requested 250m of CPU time, any extra CPU time available on the node is
distributed among the containers in a 2:1 ratio. If a container specified a
limit, it will be throttled to not use more CPU than the specified limit.

CPU requests are enforced using the CFS shares support in the Linux kernel. By
default, CPU limits are enforced using the CFS quota support in the Linux kernel
over a 100ms measuring interval, though link:#enforcing-cpu-limits[this can be
disabled].

[[overcommit-memory]]
=== Memory

A container is guaranteed the amount of memory it requests. A container may use
more memory than requested, but once it exceeds its requested amount, it could
be killed in a low memory situation on the node.

If a container uses less memory than requested, it will not be killed unless
system tasks or daemons need more memory than was accounted for in the node's
resource reservation. If a container specifies a limit on memory, it is
immediately killed if it exceeds the limited amount.

[[qos-classes]]
== Quality of Service Classes

A node is _overcommitted_ when it has a pod scheduled that makes no request, or
when the sum of limits across all pods on that node exceeds available machine
capacity.

In an overcommitted environment, it is possible that the pods on the node will
attempt to use more compute resource than is available at any given point in
time. When this occurs, the node must give priority to one pod over another. The
facility used to make this decision is referred to as a Quality of Service (QoS)
Class.

For each compute resource, a container is divided into one of three QoS classes
with decreasing order of priority:

.Quality of Service Classes
[options="header",cols="1,1,5"]
|===
|Priority |Class Name |Description

|1 (highest)
|*Guaranteed*
|If limits and optionally requests are set (not equal to 0) for all resources
and they are equal, then the container is classified as *Guaranteed*.

|2
|*Burstable*
|If requests and optionally limits are set (not equal to 0) for all resources,
and they are not equal, then the container is classified as *Burstable*.

|3 (lowest)
|*BestEffort*
|If requests and limits are not set for any of the resources, then the container
is classified as *BestEffort*.
|===

Memory is an incompressible resource, so in low memory situations, containers
are killed that have the lowest priority:

- *Guaranteed* containers are considered top priority, and are guaranteed to
only be killed if they exceed their limits, or if the system is under memory
pressure and there are no lower priority containers that can be evicted.
- *Burstable* containers under system memory pressure are more likely to be
killed once they exceed their requests and no other *BestEffort* containers
exist.
- *BestEffort* containers are treated with the lowest priority. Processes in
these containers are first to be killed if the system runs out of memory.

[[configuring-nodes-for-overcommitment]]
== Configuring Nodes for Overcommitment

In an overcommitted environment, it is important to properly configure your node
to provide best system behavior.

[[enforcing-cpu-limits]]
=== Enforcing CPU Limits

Nodes by default enforce specified CPU limits using the CPU CFS quota support in
the Linux kernel. If you do not want to enforce CPU limits on the node, you can
disable its enforcement by modifying the
link:../install_config/master_node_configuration.html[node configuration file]
(the *_node-config.yaml_* file) to include the following:

====
----
kubeletArguments:
  cpu-cfs-quota:
    - "false"
----
====

If CPU limit enforcement is disabled, it is important to understand the impact that will have on your node:

- If a container makes a request for CPU, it will continue to be enforced by CFS
shares in the Linux kernel.
- If a container makes no explicit request for CPU, but it does specify a limit,
the request will default to the specified limit, and be enforced by CFS shares
in the Linux kernel.
- If a container specifies both a request and a limit for CPU, the request will
be enforced by CFS shares in the Linux kernel, and the limit will have no
impact on the node.

[[reserving-resources-for-system-processes]]
=== Reserving Resources for System Processes

The link:../admin_guide/scheduler.html[scheduler] ensures that there are enough
resources for all pods on a node based on the pod requests. It verifies that the
sum of requests of containers on the node is no greater than the node capacity.
It includes all containers started by the node, but not containers or processes
started outside the knowledge of the cluster.

It is recommended that you reserve some portion of the node capacity to allow
for the system daemons that are required to run on your node for your cluster to
function (*sshd*, *docker*, etc.). In particular, it is recommended that you
reserve resources for incompressible resources such as memory.

If you want to explicitly reserve resources for non-pod processes, you can
create a *resource-reserver* pod that does nothing but reserve capacity from
being scheduled to on the node by the cluster. For example:

.Definition for a *resource-reserver* Pod
====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: resource-reserver
spec:
  containers:
  - name: sleep-forever
    image: gcr.io/google_containers/pause:0.8.0
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 100m <1>
        memory: 150Mi <2>
----
<1> The amount of CPU to reserve on a node for host-level daemons unknown to the
cluster.
<2> The amount of memory to reserve on a node for host-level daemons unknown to
the cluster.
====

You can save your definition to a file, for example *_resource-reserver.yaml_*,
then place the file in the node configuration directory, for example
*_/etc/origin/node/_* or the `--config=<dir>` location if otherwise specified.

With this file in place, on start of the node, the node agent launches the
specified container, and the remaining capacity for the scheduler to place
cluster pods adjusts accordingly.

[[kernel-tunable-flags]]
=== Kernel Tunable Flags

When the node starts, it ensures that the kernel tunable flags for memory
management are set properly. The kernel should never fail memory allocations
unless it runs out of physical memory.

To ensure this behavior, the node instructs the kernel to always overcommit
memory:

----
$ sysctl -w vm.overcommit_memory=1
----

The node also instructs the kernel not to panic when it runs out of memory.
Instead, the kernel OOM killer should kill processes based on priority:

----
$ sysctl -w vm.panic_on_oom=0
----

[NOTE]
====
The above flags should already be set on nodes, and no further action is
required.
====

[[disabling-swap-memory]]
=== Disabling Swap Memory

It is important to disable the use of swap memory on the node as it makes it
difficult for the resource guarantees that the scheduler makes during pod
placement to hold. For example, if two guaranteed pods have reached their memory
limit, each container would start allocating memory on swap space. Eventually,
if there was not enough swap space, processes in the pods might get killed.

Disable swap memory on each node by running:

----
$ swapoff -a
----
