You can configure an auto-scaler on your {product-title} cluster in
Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide elasticity for yor application
workload. The auto-scaler ensures that enough nodes are active to run
your pods and that the number of active nodes is proportional to
current demand.

[NOTE]

You can run the auto-scaler only on AWS.
