You can configure an auto-scaler on your {product-title} cluster in Amazon Web
Services (AWS) to ensure that
enough nodes are active to run your pods and that the number of active nodes is
proportional to current demand.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The auto-scaler is a Technology Preview feature only.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to
upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide
feedback during the development process.

For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features support scope, see
