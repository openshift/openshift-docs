== Overview
This topic describes setting up high availability for pods and services on your {product-title} cluster.

IP failover manages a pool of Virtual IP (VIP) addresses on a set of nodes. Every VIP in the set will be serviced by a node selected from the set. As long a single node is available, the VIPs will be served. There is no way to explicitly distribute the VIPs over the nodes. so there may be nodes with no VIPs and other nodes with many VIPs. If there is only one node, all VIPs will be on it.

[NOTE]
====
The VIPs must be routable from outside the cluster.
====

IP failover monitors a port on each VIP to determine whether the port is
reachable on the node. If the port is not reachable, the VIP will not be
assigned to the node. If the port is set to `0`, this check is suppressed.
xref:check-notify[The *check* script] does the needed testing.

IP failover uses link:http://www.keepalived.org/[*Keepalived*] to host a set of
externally accessible VIP addresses on a set of hosts. Each VIP is only serviced
by a single host at a time. *Keepalived* uses the VRRP protocol to determine
which host (from the set of hosts) will service which VIP. If a host becomes
unavailable or if the service that *Keepalived* is watching does not respond,
the VIP is switched to another host from the set. Thus, a VIP is always serviced
as long as a host is available.

When a host running *Keepalived* passes the *check* script, the host can become
in the *MASTER* state based on its priority and the priority of the current
*MASTER*, as determined by the xref:vrrp-preemption[preemption strategy].

The administrator can provide a script via the `--notify-script=` option, which
is called whenever the state changes. *Keepalived* is in *MASTER* state when it
is servicing the VIP, in *BACKUP* state when another node is servicing the VIP,
or in *FAULT*` state when the *check* script fails. The
xref:check-notify[*notify* script] is called with the new state whenever the
state changes.

{product-title} supports creation of IP failover deployment configuration, by
running the `oc adm ipfailover` command. The IP failover deployment configuration
specifies the set of VIP addresses, and the set of nodes on which to service
them. A cluster can have multiple IP failover deployment configurations, with
each managing its own set of unique VIP addresses. Each node in the IP failover
configuration runs an IP failover pod, and this pod runs *Keepalived*.

When using VIPs to access a pod with host networking (e.g. a router), the
application pod should be running on all nodes that are running the ipfailover
pods. This enables any of the ipfailover nodes to become the master and service
the VIPs when needed. If application pods are not running on all nodes with
ipfailover, either some ipfailover nodes will never service the VIPs or some
application pods will never receive any traffic. Use the same selector and
replication count, for both ipfailover and the application pods, to avoid this
mismatch.

While using VIPs to access a service, any of the nodes can be in the ipfailover
set of nodes, since the service is reachable on all nodes (no matter where the
application pod is running). Any of the ipfailover nodes can become master at
any time. The service can either use external IPs and a service port or it can
use a nodePort.

When using external IPs in the service definition the VIPs are set to the
external IPs and the ipfailover monitoring port is set to the service port.  A
nodePort is open on every node in the cluster and the service will load balance
traffic from whatever node currently supports the VIP. In this case, the
ipfailover monitoring port is set to the nodePort in the service definition.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Setting up a nodePort is a privileged operation.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Even though a service VIP is highly available, performance can still be affected. *keepalived* makes sure that each of the VIPs is serviced by some node in the configuration, and several VIPs may end up on the same node even when other nodes have none. Strategies that externally load balance across a set of VIPs
may be thwarted when ipfailover puts multiple VIPs on the same node.
====

When you use ingressIP, you can set up ipfailover to have the same VIP range as the ingressIP range. You can also disable the
monitoring port. In this case, all the VIPs will appear on same node in the cluster. Any user can set up a service with an ingressIP and have it highly available.

[IMPORTANT]
====
There are a maximum of 255 VIPs in the cluster.
====

////
You can configure a highly-available router or network setup by running multiple
instances of the pod and fronting them with a balancing tier. This can be
something as simple as DNS round robin, or as complex as multiple load-balancing
layers.

=== DNS Round Robin [[dns-round-robin]]

As a simple example, you can create a zone file for a DNS server, such as BIND,
that maps multiple A records for a single domain name. When clients do a lookup,
they are given one of the many records, in order, as a round robin scheme.

[NOTE]
====
The procedure below uses wildcard DNS with multiple A records to achieve the
desired round robin. The wildcard could be further distributed into shards with:

****
`*._<shard>_`
****
====

.To Configure Simple DNS Round Robin:
. Add a new zone that points to your file:
+
====

----
#### named.conf
    zone "v3.rhcloud.com" IN {
            type master;
            file "v3.rhcloud.com.zone";
    };

----
====

. Define the round robin mappings for the DNS lookup:
+
====

----
#### v3.rhcloud.com.zone
    $ORIGIN v3.rhcloud.com.

    @       IN      SOA     . v3.rhcloud.com. (
                         2009092001         ; Serial
                             604800         ; Refresh
                              86400         ; Retry
                            1206900         ; Expire
                                300 )       ; Negative Cache TTL
            IN      NS      ns1.v3.rhcloud.com.
    ns1     IN      A       127.0.0.1
    *       IN      A       10.245.2.2
            IN      A       10.245.2.3


----
====

. Test the entry. The following example test uses `dig` (available in the
*bind-utils* package) in a *Vagrant* environment to show multiple answers for
the same lookup. Performing multiple pings shows the resolution swapping between
IP addresses:

[[configuring-ip-failover]]
== Configuring IP Failover

Use the `oc adm ipfailover` command with suitable xref:../admin_guide/high_availability.adoc#options-environment-variables[options], to create ipfailover deployment configuration.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, ipfailover is not compatible with cloud
infrastructures. For AWS, an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) can be used to make {product-title} highly available,
link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/elb-getting-started.html[using
the AWS console].
====

As an administrator, you can configure ipfailover on an entire cluster, or on a
subset of nodes, as defined by the label selector. You can also configure
multiple IP failover deployment configurations in your cluster, where each one
is independent of the others. The `oc adm ipfailover` command creates an
ipfailover deployment configuration which ensures that a failover pod runs on
each of the nodes matching the constraints or the label used. This pod runs
link:http://www.keepalived.org/[*Keepalived*] which uses VRRP (Virtual Router
Redundancy Protocol) among all the *Keepalived* daemons to ensure that the
service on the watched port is available, and if it is not, *Keepalived* will
automatically float the virtual IPs (VIPs).

For production use, make sure to use a `--selector=<label>` with at least two nodes to select
the nodes. Also, set a `--replicas=<n>` value that matches the
number of nodes for the given labeled selector.

The `oc adm ipfailover` command includes command line options that set environment
variables that control *Keepalived*. The
xref:../admin_guide/high_availability.adoc#options-environment-variables[environment variables]
start with `OPENSHIFT_HA_*` and they can be changed as needed.

For example, the command below will create an IP failover configuration on a selection of nodes labeled `router=us-west-ha` (on 4 nodes with 7 virtual IPs monitoring a service
listening on port 80, such as the router process).

----
$ oc adm ipfailover --selector="router=us-west-ha" \
    --virtual-ips="1.2.3.4,10.1.1.100-104,5.6.7.8" \
    --watch-port=80 --replicas=4 --create
----


////
You can view what the configuration configuration that would look like
using one of the supported formats (the example below uses the JSON format):

----
$ oc adm ipfailover [<Ip_failover_config_name>] <options> -o json
----

            <string> = a string of characters.
            <number> = a number ([0-9]*).
////

[[virtual-ips]]
=== Virtual IP Addresses
*Keepalived* manages a set of virtual IP addresses (VIPs). The administrator must make sure that all these addresses:

* Are accessible on the configured hosts from outside the cluster.
* Are not used for any other purpose within the cluster.

*Keepalived* on each node determines whether the needed service is running. If it is, VIPs are supported and *Keepalived* participates in the negotiation to determine which node will serve the VIP. For a node to participate, the service must be listening on the watch port on a VIP or the check must be disabled.

[NOTE]
====
Each VIP in the set may end up being served by a different node.
====

[[check-notify]]
=== Check and Notify Scripts

*Keepalived* monitors the health of the application by periodically running
an optional user supplied check script. For example, the script can test a
web server by issuing a request and verifying the response.

The script is provided through the `--check-script=<script>` option to the `oc adm
ipfailover` command. The script must exit with `0` for *PASS* or `1` for *FAIL*.

By default, the check is done every two seconds, but can be changed using the
`--check-interval=<seconds>` option.

When a check script is not provided, a simple default script is run that tests
the xref:../install/prerequisites.adoc#required-ports[TCP
connection]. This default test is suppressed when the monitor port is `0`.

For each virtual IPs (VIPs), *keepalived* keeps the state of the node. The VIP on the node may
be in *MASTER*, *BACKUP*, or *FAULT* state. All VIPs on the node that are not in
the *FAULT* state participate in the negotiation to decide which will be
*MASTER* for the VIP. All of the losers enter the *BACKUP* state. When the
*check* script on the *MASTER* fails, the VIP enters the *FAULT* state and
triggers a renegotiation. When the *BACKUP* fails, the VIP enters the *FAULT*
state. When the *check* script passes again on a VIP in the *FAULT* state, it
exits *FAULT* and negotiates for *MASTER*. The resulting state is either
*MASTER* or *BACKUP*.

The administrator can provide an optional *notify* script, which is called
whenever the state changes. *Keepalived* passes the following three parameters
to the script:

* `$1` - "GROUP"|"INSTANCE"
* `$2` - Name of the group or instance
* `$3` - The new state ("MASTER"|"BACKUP"|"FAULT")

These scripts run in the IP failover pod and use the pod's file system, not the
host file system. The options require the full path to the script. The
administrator must make the script available in the pod to extract the results
from running the *notify* script. The recommended approach for providing the
scripts is to use a
xref:../dev_guide/configmaps.adoc#dev-guide-configmaps[ConfigMap].

The full path names of the *check* and *notify* scripts are added to the
*keepalived* configuration file, *_/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf_*, which is
loaded every time *keepalived* starts. The scripts can be added to the pod with
a ConfigMap as follows.

. Create the desired script and create a ConfigMap to hold it. The script
has no input arguments and must return `0` for *OK* and `1` for *FAIL*.
+
The check script, *_mycheckscript.sh_*:
+
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
    # Whatever tests are needed
    # E.g., send request and verify response
exit 0
----

. Create the ConfigMap:
+
----
$ oc create configmap mycustomcheck --from-file=mycheckscript.sh
----

. There are two approaches to adding the script to the pod: use `oc` commands or
edit the deployment configuration. In both cases, the `defaultMode` for the
mounted `configMap` files must allow execution. A value of `0755` (`493`
decimal) is typical.

.. Using `oc` commands:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc set env dc/ipf-ha-router \
    OPENSHIFT_HA_CHECK_SCRIPT=/etc/keepalive/mycheckscript.sh
$ oc volume dc/ipf-ha-router --add --overwrite \
    --name=config-volume \
    --mount-path=/etc/keepalive \
    --source='{"configMap": { "name": "mycustomcheck", "defaultMode": 493}}'
----
+
.. Editing the *ipf-ha-router* deployment configuration:
+
... Use `oc edit dc ipf-ha-router` to edit the router deployment configuration
with a text editor.
+
[source,yaml]
----
...
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        - name: OPENSHIFT_HA_CHECK_SCRIPT  <1>
          value: /etc/keepalive/mycheckscript.sh
...
        volumeMounts: <2>
        - mountPath: /etc/keepalive
          name: config-volume
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
...
      volumes: <3>
      - configMap:
          defaultMode: 0755 <4>
          name: customrouter
        name: config-volume
...
----
<1> In the `spec.container.env` field, add the `OPENSHIFT_HA_CHECK_SCRIPT`
environment variable to point to the mounted script file.
<2> Add the `spec.container.volumeMounts` field to create the mount point.
<3> Add a new `spec.volumes` field to mention the ConfigMap.
<4> This sets execute permission on the files. When read back, it will be
displayed in decimal (`493`).
+
... Save the changes and exit the editor. This restarts *ipf-ha-router*.

[[vrrp-preemption]]
=== VRRP Preemption

When a host leaves the *FAULT* state by passing the check script, the host
becomes a *BACKUP* if the new host has lower priority than the host currently in
the *MASTER* state. However, if it has a higher priority, the preemption
strategy determines it's role in the cluster.

The *nopreempt* strategy does not move *MASTER* from the lower priority host to
the higher priority host. With *preempt 300*, the default, *keepalived* waits
the specified 300 seconds and moves *MASTER* to the higher priority host.

To specify preemption:

.. When creating ipfailover using the `preemption-strategy`:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc adm ipfailover --preempt-strategy=nopreempt \
  ...
----


.. Setting the variable using the `oc set env` command:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc set env dc/ipf-ha-router \
    --overwrite=true \
    OPENSHIFT_HA_PREEMPTION=nopreempt
----

.. Using `oc edit dc ipf-ha-router` to edit the router deployment configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
...
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        - name: OPENSHIFT_HA_PREEMPTION  <1>
          value: nopreempt
...
----


[[kepalived-multicast]]
=== Keepalived Multicast

{product-title}'s  IP failover internally uses *keepalived*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that *multicast* is enabled on the nodes labeled above and they can
accept network traffic for 224.0.0.18 (the VRRP multicast IP address).
====

Before starting the *keepalived* daemon, the startup script verifies the
`iptables` rule that allows multicast traffic to flow.  If there is no such
rule, the startup script creates a new rule and adds it to the IP tables
configuration.  Where this new rule gets added to the IP tables configuration
depends on the `--iptables-chain=` option. If there is an `--iptables-chain=`
option specified, the rule gets added to the specified chain in the option.
Otherwise, the rule is added to the `INPUT` chain.


[IMPORTANT]
====
The `iptables` rule must be present whenever there is one or more *keepalived* daemon running on the node.
====

The `iptables` rule can be removed after the last *keepalived* daemon terminates. The rule is not automatically removed.

You can manually manage the `iptables` rule on each of the nodes. It only gets created when none is present (as long as ipfailover is not created with the -`-iptable-chain=""` option).

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must ensure that the manually added rules persist after a system restart.

Be careful since every *keepalived* daemon uses the VRRP protocol over multicast 224.0.0.18 to negotiate with its peers.  There must be a different VRRP-id (in the range 0..255) for
xref:../admin_guide/high_availability.adoc#ha-vrrp-id-offset[each VIP].
====

----
$ for node in openshift-node-{5,6,7,8,9}; do   ssh $node <<EOF

export interface=${interface:-"eth0"}
echo "Check multicast enabled ... ";
ip addr show $interface | grep -i MULTICAST

echo "Check multicast groups ... "

[[ha-vrrp-id-offset]]
=== VRRP ID Offset

Each ipfailover pod managed by the ipfailover deployment configuration (1 pod per node/replica) runs a *keepalived* daemon. As more ipfailover deployment configurations are configured, more pods are created and more daemons join into the common VRRP negotiation. This negotiation is done by all the *keepalived* daemons and it determines which nodes will service which virtual IPs (VIPs).

Internally, *keepalived* assigns a unique vrrp-id to each VIP. The negotiation uses this set of vrrp-ids, when a decision is made, the VIP corresponding to the winning vrrp-id is serviced on the winning node.

Therefore, for every VIP defined in the ipfailover deployment configuration, the ipfailover pod must assign a corresponding vrrp-id. This is done by starting at `--vrrp-id-offset` and sequentially assigning the vrrp-ids to
the list of VIPs.  The vrrp-ids may have values in the range 1..255.

When there are multiple ipfailover deployment configuration care must be taken to specify `--vrrp-id-offset` so that there is room to increase the number of VIPS in the deployment configuration and none of the vrrp-id ranges overlap.

[[admin-guide-high-availability-configuring-more-than-254]]
=== Configuring IP failover for more than 254 addresses

IP failover management is limited to 254 groups of VIP addresses. By default
[product-title] assigns one IP address to each group. You can use the
`virtual-ip-groups` option to change this so multiple IP addresses are in each
group and define the number of VIP groups available for each VRRP instance when
xref:configuring-ip-failover[configuring IP failover]. 

Grouping VIPs creates a wider range of allocation of VIPs per VRRP in the case
of VRRP failover events, and is useful when all hosts in the cluster have access
to a service locally. For example, when a service is being exposed with an
`ExternalIP`. 

[NOTE]
====
As a rule for failover, do not limit services, such as the router, to
one specific host. Instead, services should be replicated to each host so that
in the case of IP failover, the services do not have to be recreated on the new
host.
====

[NOTE]
====
If you are using {product-title} health checks, the nature of IP failover and
groups means that all instances in the group will not be checked. For that
reason,
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/[the
Kubernetes health checks] must be used to ensure that services are live.
====

----
# oc adm ipfailover <ipfailover_name> --create \
    ...
    --virtual-ip-groups=<number_of_ipfailover_groups>
----

For example, if `--virtual-ip-groups` is set to `3` in an environment with seven
VIPs, it creates three groups, assigning three VIPs to the first group, and two
VIPs to the two remaining groups.

[NOTE]
====
If the number of groups set by the `--virtual-ip-groups` option is fewer than
the number of IP addresses set to fail over, the group will contain more than

=== Configuring a Highly-available Service

The following example describes how to set up highly-available *router* and
*geo-cache* network services with IP failover on a set of nodes.

. Label the nodes that will be used for the services. This step can be optional
if you run the services on all the nodes in your {product-title} cluster and
will use VIPs that can float within all nodes in the cluster.
+
The following example defines a label for nodes that are servicing
traffic in the US west geography *ha-svc-nodes=geo-us-west*:
+
====
----
$ oc label nodes openshift-node-{5,6,7,8,9} "ha-svc-nodes=geo-us-west"
----
====

. Create the service account. You can use ipfailover or when using a router
(depending on your environment policies), you can either reuse the *router*
service account created previously or a new ipfailover service account.
+
The following example creates a new service account with the name ipfailover in the
*default* namespace:
+
====
----
$ oc create serviceaccount ipfailover -n default
----
====

. Add the ipfailover service account in the *default* namespace to the *privileged* SCC:
+
====
----
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:default:ipfailover
----
====

. Start the *router* and the *geo-cache* services.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Since the ipfailover runs on all nodes from step 1, it is recommended to also
run the router/service on all the step 1 nodes.
====
+
.. Start the router with the nodes matching the labels used in the first step.
The following example runs five instances using the ipfailover service account:
+
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
====
----
$ oc adm router ha-router-us-west --replicas=5 \
    --selector="ha-svc-nodes=geo-us-west" \
    --labels="ha-svc-nodes=geo-us-west" \
    --service-account=ipfailover
----
====
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
====
----
$ oc adm router ha-router-us-west --replicas=5 \
    --selector="ha-svc-nodes=geo-us-west" \
    --labels="ha-svc-nodes=geo-us-west" \
    --service-account=ipfailover
----
====
endif::[]
+
.. Run the *geo-cache* service with a replica on each of the nodes. See an
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/openshift-docs/master/admin_guide/examples/geo-cache.json[example
configuration] for running a *geo-cache* service.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure that you replace the *myimages/geo-cache* Docker image referenced in
the file with your intended image. Change the number of replicas to the number
of nodes in the *geo-cache* label. Check that the label matches the one used in
the first step.
====
+
----
$ oc create -n <namespace> -f ./examples/geo-cache.json
----

. Configure ipfailover for the *router* and *geo-cache* services. Each has its
own VIPs and both use the same nodes labeled with *ha-svc-nodes=geo-us-west* in
the first step. Ensure that the number of replicas match the number of
nodes listed in the label setup, in the first step.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The *router*, *geo-cache*, and ipfailover all create deployment configuration
and all must have different names.
====

. Specify the VIPs and the port number that ipfailover should monitor on the
desired instances.
+
The ipfailover command for the *router*:
+
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
====
----
$ oc adm ipfailover ipf-ha-router-us-west \
    --replicas=5 --watch-port=80 \
    --selector="ha-svc-nodes=geo-us-west" \
    --virtual-ips="10.245.2.101-105" \
    --iptables-chain="INPUT" \
    --service-account=ipfailover --create
----
====
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
====
----
$ oc adm ipfailover ipf-ha-router-us-west \
    --replicas=5 --watch-port=80 \
    --selector="ha-svc-nodes=geo-us-west" \
    --virtual-ips="10.245.2.101-105" \
    --iptables-chain="INPUT" \
    --service-account=ipfailover --create
----
====
endif::[]

+
The following is the `oc adm ipfailover` command for the *geo-cache* service that is
listening on port 9736. Since there are two `ipfailover` deployment
configurations, the `--vrrp-id-offset` must be set so that each VIP gets its own
offset. In this case, setting a value of `10` means that the
`ipf-ha-router-us-west` can have a maximum of 10 VIPs (0-9) since
`ipf-ha-geo-cache` is starting at 10.
+
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
====
----
$ oc adm ipfailover ipf-ha-geo-cache \
    --replicas=5 --watch-port=9736 \
    --selector="ha-svc-nodes=geo-us-west" \
    --virtual-ips=10.245.3.101-105 \
    --vrrp-id-offset=10 \
    --service-account=ipfailover --create
----
====
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
====
----
$ oc adm ipfailover ipf-ha-geo-cache \
    --replicas=5 --watch-port=9736 \
    --selector="ha-svc-nodes=geo-us-west" \
    --virtual-ips=10.245.3.101-105 \
    --vrrp-id-offset=10 \
    --service-account=ipfailover --create
----
====
endif::[]

+
In the commands above, there are *ipfailover*, *router*, and *geo-cache* pods on
each node. The set of VIPs for each ipfailover configuration must not overlap
and they must not be used elsewhere in the external or cloud environments. The
five VIP addresses in each example, `10.245.{2,3}.101-105` are served by the two
ipfailover deployment configurations. IP failover dynamically selects which
address is served on which node.
+
The administrator sets up external DNS to point to the VIP addresses knowing
that all the *router* VIPs point to the same *router*, and all the *geo-cache*
VIPs point to the same *geo-cache* service. As long as one node remains running,
all the VIP addresses are served.

[[dynamically-updating-vips-for-a-highly-available-service]]
=== Dynamically Updating Virtual IPs for a Highly-available Service

The default deployment strategy for the IP failover service is to recreate the deployment. In order to dynamically update the VIPs for a highly available routing service with minimal or no downtime, you must:

- Update the IP failover service deployment configuration to use a rolling update strategy, and
- Update the `OPENSHIFT_HA_VIRTUAL_IPS` environment variable with the updated list or sets of virtual IP addresses.

The following example shows how to dynamically update the deployment strategy and the virtual IP addresses:

. Consider an IP failover configuration that was created using the following:
+
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
====
----
$ oc adm ipfailover ipf-ha-router-us-west \
    --replicas=5 --watch-port=80 \
    --selector="ha-svc-nodes=geo-us-west" \
    --virtual-ips="10.245.2.101-105" \
    --service-account=ipfailover --create
----
====
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
====
----
$ oc adm ipfailover ipf-ha-router-us-west \
    --replicas=5 --watch-port=80 \
    --selector="ha-svc-nodes=geo-us-west" \
    --virtual-ips="10.245.2.101-105" \
    --service-account=ipfailover --create
----
====
endif::[]

. Edit the deployment configuration:
+
====
----
$ oc edit dc/ipf-ha-router-us-west
----
====

. Update the `*spec.strategy.type*` field from `Recreate` to `Rolling`:
+
====
----
spec:
  replicas: 5
  selector:
    ha-svc-nodes: geo-us-west
  strategy:
    recreateParams:
      timeoutSeconds: 600
    resources: {}
    type: Rolling <1>
----
<1> Set to `Rolling`.
====

. Update the `*OPENSHIFT_HA_VIRTUAL_IPS*` environment variable to contain the
additional virtual IP addresses:
+
====
----
- name: OPENSHIFT_HA_VIRTUAL_IPS
  value: 10.245.2.101-105,10.245.2.110,10.245.2.201-205 <1>
----
<1> `10.245.2.110,10.245.2.201-205` have been added to the list.
====

. Update the external DNS to match the set of VIPs.

[[cluster-ip-nodeport]]
== Configuring Service ExternalIP and NodePort

The user can assign VIPs as
xref:../dev_guide/expose_service/expose_internal_ip_service.adoc#getting-traffic-into-cluster-ip[ExternalIPs]
in a service. *Keepalived* makes sure that each VIP is served on some node in the ipfailover configuration. When a request arrives on the node, the service that is running on all nodes in the cluster, load balances the request among the service's endpoints.

The xref:../dev_guide/expose_service/expose_internal_ip_nodeport.adoc#getting-traffic-into-cluster-nodeport[NodePorts] can be set to the ipfailover watch port so that *keepalived* can check the application is running.  The NodePort is exposed on all nodes in the cluster, therefore it is available to *keepalived* on all ipfailover nodes.


[[cluster-ha-ingressIP]]
== High Availability For IngressIP

In non-cloud clusters, ipfailover and xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#service-ingressip[ingressIP] to a service can be combined. The result is high availability services for users that create services using ingressIP.

The approach is to specify an `ingressIPNetworkCIDR` range and then use the same range in creating the ipfailover configuration.

Since, ipfailover can support up to a maximum of 255 VIPs for the entire cluster, the `ingressIPNetworkCIDR` needs to be `/24` or less.
