Seccomp (secure computing mode) is used to restrict the set of system calls
applications can make, allowing cluster administrators greater control over the
security of workloads running in {product-title}.

Seccomp support is achieved via two annotations in the pod configuration:

* *seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod*: profile applies to all containers in the pod that do not override
* *container.seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/<container_name>*: container-specific profile override

[IMPORTANT]
====
Containers are run with *unconfined* seccomp settings by default.

design document].

[[seccomp-enabling-seccomp]]
== Enabling Seccomp

Seccomp is a feature of the Linux kernel. To ensure seccomp is enabled on your
system, run:

----
$ cat /boot/config-`uname -r` | grep CONFIG_SECCOMP=
CONFIG_SECCOMP=y
----

== Configuring {product-title} for Seccomp

A seccomp profile is a json file providing syscalls and the appropriate action
to take when a syscall is invoked.

. Create the seccomp profile.
+
The
link:https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/profiles/seccomp/default.json[default
profile] is sufficient in many cases, but the cluster administrator must define
the security constraints of an individual system.
+
To create your own custom profile, create a file on every node in the
`seccomp-profile-root` directory.
+
If you are using the default *docker/default* profile, you do not need to
create one.

. Configure your nodes to use the *seccomp-profile-root* where your profiles
will be stored. In the *node-config.yaml* via the *kubeletArguments*:
+
----
kubeletArguments:
  seccomp-profile-root:
    - "/your/path"
----

. Restart the node service to apply the changes:
+
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
# systemctl restart origin-node
----
endif::[]

. In order to control which profiles may be used, and to set the default profile,
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#authorization-seccomp[configure
your SCC] via the *seccompProfiles* field. The first profile will be used as a
default.
+
The allowable formats of the *seccompProfiles* field include:
+
* *docker/default*: the default profile for the container runtime (no profile required)
* *unconfined*: unconfined profile, and disables seccomp
* *localhost/<profile-name>*: the profile installed to the node's local seccomp profile root
+
For example, if you are using the default *docker/default* profile, configure your SCC with:
+
----
seccompProfiles:
- docker/default
----

[[seccomp-configuring-openshift-with-custom-seccomp]]
==  Configuring {product-title} for a Custom Seccomp Profile

To ensure pods in your cluster run with a custom profile:

. Create the seccomp profile in *seccomp-profile-root*.

. Configure *seccomp-profile-root*:
+
----
kubeletArguments:
  seccomp-profile-root:
    - "/your/path"
----

. Restart the node service to apply the changes:
+
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
# systemctl restart origin-node
----
endif::[]

. Configure your SCC:
+
----
seccompProfiles:
- localhost/<profile-name>
