== Overview

You can control which images are allowed to run on your cluster using the ImagePolicy
admission plug-in (currently considered beta). It allows you to control:

- *The source of images*: which registries can be used to pull images
- *Image resolution*: force pods to run with immutable digests to ensure the image does not change due to a re-tag
- *Container image label restrictions*: force an image to have or not have particular labels
- *Image annotation restrictions*: force an image in the integrated container registry to have or not have particular annotations

== Configuring the ImagePolicy Admission Plug-in

To enable this feature, configure the plug-in in `*_master-config.yaml_*`:

<1> Try to resolve images to an immutable image digest and update the image pull specification in the pod.
<2> Array of rules to evaluate against incoming resources. If you only have reject==true rules,
    the default is *allow all*. If you have any accept rule, the default is *deny all*.
<3> Indicates which resources to enforce rules upon. If nothing is specified, the default is *pods*.
<4> Indicates that if this rule matches, the pod should be rejected.
<5> List of annotations to match on the image object's metadata.
<6> If you are not able to resolve the image, do not fail the pod.
<7> Array of rules allowing use of image streams in Kubernetes resources. The default configuration
    allows pods, replicationcontrollers, replicasets, statefulsets, daemonsets, deployments, and jobs
    to use same-project image stream tag references in their image fields.
<8> Identifies the group and resource to which this rule applies. If resource is `*`,
    this rule will apply to all resources in that group.
<9> `LocalNames` will allow single segment names (for example, `*ruby:2.4*`) to be
interpreted as namespace-local image stream tags, but only if the resource or
target image stream has
xref:../dev_guide/managing_images.adoc#using-is-with-k8s[`local name
resolution`] enabled.
====

[NOTE]
====
If you normally rely on infrastructure images being pulled using a default
registry prefix (such as *docker.io* or *registry.access.redhat.com*), those
images will not match to any `matchRegistries` value since they will have no
registry prefix. To ensure infrastructure images have a registry prefix that
can match your image policy, set the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
  xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-config-image-config[imageConfig.format]
endif::[]
ifndef::openshift-enterprise[]
  imageConfig.format
endif::[]
value in your `master-config.yaml` file.

== Testing the ImagePolicy Admission Plug-in

. Use the `openshift/image-policy-check` to test your configuration.
+
For example, use the information above, then test like this:
+
----
oc import-image openshift/image-policy-check:latest --confirm
----

. Create a pod using this YAML. The pod should be created.
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  generateName: test-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: docker.io/openshift/image-policy-check:latest
    name: first
----

. Create another pod pointing to a different registry. The pod should be rejected.
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  generateName: test-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: different-registry/openshift/image-policy-check:latest
    name: first
----

. Create a pod pointing to the internal registry using the imported image. The pod
should be created and if you look at the image specification, you should see a
digest in place of the tag.
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  generateName: test-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: <internal registry IP>:5000/<namespace>/image-policy-check:latest
    name: first
----

. Create a pod pointing to the internal registry using the imported image. The pod
should be created and if you look at the image specification, you should see the
tag unmodified.
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  generateName: test-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: <internal registry IP>:5000/<namespace>/image-policy-check:v1
    name: first
----

. Get the digest from `oc get istag/image-policy-check:latest` and use it for
`oc annotate images/<digest> images.openshift.io/deny-execution=true`. For example:
+
----
$ oc annotate images/sha256:09ce3d8b5b63595ffca6636c7daefb1a615a7c0e3f8ea68e5db044a9340d6ba8 images.openshift.io/deny-execution=true
----

. Create this pod again, and you should see the pod rejected:
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  generateName: test-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: <internal registry IP>:5000/<namespace>/image-policy-check:latest
    name: first
