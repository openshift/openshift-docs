== Overview

You can control which images can be imported, tagged, and run in a cluster.
There are two facilities for this purpose.

xref:#image-policy-configuring-the-image-policy-admission-plug-in[Allowed
Registries for import] is an image policy configuration that allows to
restrict image origins to particular set of external registries. This set of
rules is applied to any image being imported or tagged into any image stream.
Therefore any image referencing registry not matched by the rule set will be
rejected.

xref:#image-policy-testing-image-policy-admission-plug-in[ImagePolicy
admission plug-in] lets you specify which images are allowed to be run on
your cluster. This is currently considered beta. It allows you to control:

- *Image sources*: which registries can be used to pull images
- *Image resolution*: force pods to run with immutable digests to ensure the
  image does not change due to a re-tag
- *Container image label restrictions*: limits or requires labels on an image
- *Image annotation restrictions*: limits or requires the annotations on an image
in the integrated container registry

== Configuring Registries Allowed for Import

You can configure registries allowed for import in *_master-config.yaml_*
under `imagePolicyConfig:allowedRegistriesForImport` section as demonstrated in
the following example. If the setting is not present, all images are allowed,
which is the default.

[[example-configuration-of-registries-allowed-for-import]]
.Example Configuration of Registries Allowed for Import
====
[source,yaml]
----
imagePolicyConfig:
  allowedRegistriesForImport:
  -
    domainName: registry.access.redhat.com <1>
  -
    domainName: *.mydomain.com
    insecure: true <2>
  -
    domainName: local.registry.corp:5000 <3>
----
<1> Allow any image from the specified secure registry.
<2> Allow any image from any insecure registry hosted on any sub-domain of
`mydomain.com`. The `mydomain.com` is not whitelisted.
<3> Allow any image from the given registry with port specified.
====

Each rule is composed of the following attributes:

- `*domainName*`: is a hostname optionally terminated by `:<port>` suffix
where special wildcard characters (`?`, `*`) are recognized. The former
matches a sequence of characters of any length while the later matches
exactly one character. The wildcard characters can be present both before and
after `:` separator. The wildcards apply only to the part before or after the
separator regardless of separator's presence.
- `*insecure*`: is a boolean used to decide which ports are matched if the
`:<port>` part is missing from `*domainName*`. If true, the `*domainName*`
will match registries with `:80` suffix or unspecified port as long as the
insecure flag is used during import. If false, registries with `:443` suffix
or unspecified port will be matched.

If a rule should match both secure and insecure ports of the same domain, the
rule must be listed twice (once with `insecure=true` and once with
`insecure=false`.

Unqualified images references are qualified to `docker.io` before any
rule evaluation. To whitelist them, use `domainName: docker.io`.

`*domainName: \**` rule matches any registry hostname, but port is still
restricted to `443`. To match arbitrary registry serving on arbitrary port, use
`*domainName: *:**`.

Based on the rules established in
xref:#example-configuration-of-registries-allowed-for-import[Example
Configuration of Registries Allowed for Import]:

- `oc tag --insecure reg.mydomain.com/app:v1 app:v1` is whitelisted by the
handling of the `mydomain.com` rule
- `oc import-image --from reg1.mydomain.com:80/foo foo:latest` will be also
  whitelisted
- `oc tag local.registry.corp/bar bar:latest` will be rejected because the port
  does not match `5000` in the third rule

Rejected image imports will generate error messages similar to the following text:

----
The ImageStream "bar" is invalid:
* spec.tags[latest].from.name: Forbidden: registry "local.registry.corp" not allowed by whitelist: "local.registry.corp:5000", "*.mydomain.com:80", "registry.access.redhat.com:443"
* status.tags[latest].items[0].dockerImageReference: Forbidden: registry "local.registry.corp" not allowed by whitelist: "local.registry.corp:5000", "*.mydomain.com:80", "registry.access.redhat.com:443"

== Configuring the ImagePolicy Admission Plug-in
To configure which images can run on your cluster, configure the ImagePolicy
Admission plug-in in the `*_master-config.yaml_*` file. You can set one or more
rules as required.

* *Reject images with a particular annotation*:
+
Use this rule to reject all images that have a specific annotation set on them.
The following rejects all images using the `images.openshift.io/deny-execution` annotation:
+
[source, yaml]
----
- name: execution-denied
  onResources:
  - resource: pods
  - resource: builds
  reject: true
  matchImageAnnotations:
  - key: images.openshift.io/deny-execution <1>
    value: "true"
  skipOnResolutionFailure: true
----
<1> If a particular image has been deemed harmful, administrators can set this annotation to flag those images.

* *Enable user to run images from Docker Hub*:
+
Use this rule to allow users to use images from Docker Hub:
+
[source, bash]
----
- name: allow-images-from-dockerhub
  onResources:
    - resource: pods
    - resource: builds
    matchRegistries:
    - docker.io
----

Following is an example configuration for setting multiple ImagePolicy
addmission plugin rules in the `*_master-config.yaml_*` file:

----
<1> Try to resolve images to an immutable image digest and update the image pull
specification in the pod.
<2> Array of rules to evaluate against incoming resources. If you only have
`reject: true` rules, the default is *allow all*. If you have any accept rule,
that is `reject: false` in any of the rules, the default behaviour of the
ImagePolicy switches to *deny-all*.
<3> Indicates which resources to enforce rules upon. If nothing is specified,
the default is *pods*.
<4> Indicates that if this rule matches, the pod should be rejected.
<5> List of annotations to match on the image object's metadata.
<6> If you are not able to resolve the image, do not fail the pod.
<7> Array of rules allowing use of image streams in Kubernetes resources. The
default configuration allows pods, replicationcontrollers, replicasets,
statefulsets, daemonsets, deployments, and jobs to use same-project image stream
tag references in their image fields.
<8> Identifies the group and resource to which this rule applies. If resource is
`*`, this rule will apply to all resources in that group.
<9> `LocalNames` will allow single segment names (for example, `*ruby:2.4*`) to
be interpreted as namespace-local image stream tags, but only if the resource or
target image stream has
xref:../dev_guide/managing_images.adoc#using-is-with-k8s[`local name resolution`] enabled.

[NOTE]
====
If you normally rely on infrastructure images being pulled using a default
registry prefix (such as *docker.io* or *registry.access.redhat.com*), those
images will not match to any `matchRegistries` value since they will have no
registry prefix. To ensure infrastructure images have a registry prefix that
can match your image policy, set the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
  xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-config-image-config[imageConfig.format]
endif::[]
ifndef::openshift-enterprise[]
  imageConfig.format
endif::[]
value in your `master-config.yaml` file.

== Testing the ImagePolicy Admission Plug-in

. Use the `openshift/image-policy-check` to test your configuration.
+
For example, use the information above, then test like this:
+
----
oc import-image openshift/image-policy-check:latest --confirm
----

. Create a pod using this YAML. The pod should be created.
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  generateName: test-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: docker.io/openshift/image-policy-check:latest
    name: first
----

. Create another pod pointing to a different registry. The pod should be rejected.
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  generateName: test-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: different-registry/openshift/image-policy-check:latest
    name: first
----

. Create a pod pointing to the internal registry using the imported image. The pod
should be created and if you look at the image specification, you should see a
digest in place of the tag.
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  generateName: test-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: <internal registry IP>:5000/<namespace>/image-policy-check:latest
    name: first
----

. Create a pod pointing to the internal registry using the imported image. The pod
should be created and if you look at the image specification, you should see the
tag unmodified.
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  generateName: test-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: <internal registry IP>:5000/<namespace>/image-policy-check:v1
    name: first
----

. Get the digest from `oc get istag/image-policy-check:latest` and use it for
`oc annotate images/<digest> images.openshift.io/deny-execution=true`. For example:
+
----
$ oc annotate images/sha256:09ce3d8b5b63595ffca6636c7daefb1a615a7c0e3f8ea68e5db044a9340d6ba8 images.openshift.io/deny-execution=true
----

. Create this pod again, and you should see the pod rejected:
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  generateName: test-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: <internal registry IP>:5000/<namespace>/image-policy-check:latest
    name: first
