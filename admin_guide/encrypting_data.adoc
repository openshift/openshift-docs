[[encrypting-data-overview]]
== Overview

This topic reviews how to enable and configure encryption of secret data at the
datastore layer. While the examples use the `secrets` resource, any resource can be
encrypted, such as `configmaps`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
etcd v3 or later is required in order to use this feature.
====

[[encrypting-data-configuration]]
== Configuration and Determining Whether Encryption Is Already Enabled

To activate data encryption, pass the
`--experimental-encryption-provider-config` argument to the Kubernetes API
server:

.Excerpt of *_master-config.yaml_*
[source,yaml]
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  apiServerArguments:
    experimental-encryption-provider-config:
    - /path/to/encryption-config.yaml
----

For more information about *_master-config.yaml_* and its format, see the
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-configuration-files[Master
Configuration Files] topic.

<1> Each `resources` array item is a separate configuration and contains a complete configuration.
<2> The `resources.resources` field is an array of Kubernetes resource names (`resource` or
`resource.group`) that should be encrypted.
<3> The `providers` array is an ordered xref:encrypting-data-providers[list of
the possible encryption providers]. Only one provider type can be specified per entry (`identity` or
`aescbc` can be provided, but not both in the same item).
<4> The first provider in the list is used to encrypt resources going into storage.
<5> Arbitrary name of the secret.
<6> Base64 encoded random key. Different providers have different key lengths. See instructions
on xref:encrypting-data-process[how to generate the key].

When reading resources from storage, each provider that matches the stored data attempts to decrypt
the data in order. If no provider can read the stored data due to a mismatch in format or secret
key, an error is returned, which prevents clients from accessing that resource.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If any resource is not readable via the encryption configuration (because keys
were changed), the only recourse is to delete that key from the underlying etcd
directly. Calls attempting to read that resource will fail until it is deleted
or a valid decryption key is provided.
====

[[encrypting-data-providers]]
=== Available Providers

[cols="1,1,1,1,1,3"]
|===
| Name | Encryption | Strength | Speed | Key Length | Other Considerations

| *identity*
| None
| N/A
| N/A
| N/A
| Resources written as-is without encryption. When set as the first provider, the resource will be
decrypted as new values are written.

| *aescbc*
| AES-CBC with PKCS#7 padding
| Strongest
| Fast
| 32-byte
| The recommended choice for encryption, but may be slightly slower than *secretbox*.

| *secretbox*
| XSalsa20 and Poly1305
| Strong
| Faster
| 32-byte
| A newer standard and may not be considered acceptable in environments that
require high levels of review.

| *aesgcm*
| AES-GCM with a random initialization vector (IV)
| Must be rotated every 200,000 writes
| Fastest
| 16, 24, or 32-byte
| *Is not recommended* for use except when an automated key rotation scheme is implemented.

|===

Each provider supports multiple keys. The keys are tried in order for
decryption. If the provider is the first provider, the first key is used for
encryption.

[NOTE]
====
Kubernetes has no proper nonce generator and uses a random IV as nonce for
AES-GCM. Since AES-GCM requires a proper nonce to be secure, AES-GCM is not
recommended. The 200,000 write limit just limits the possibility of a fatal
nonce misuse to a reasonable low margin.

[[encrypting-data-process]]
== Encrypting Data

Create a new encryption configuration file.

[source,yaml]
----
kind: EncryptionConfig
apiVersion: v1
resources:
  - resources:
    - secrets
    providers:
    - aescbc:
        keys:
        - name: key1
          secret: <BASE 64 ENCODED SECRET>
    - identity: {}
----

To create a new secret:

. Generate a 32-byte random key and base64 encode it. For example, on Linux and
macOS use:
+
----
$ head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The encryption key must be generated with an appropriate cryptographically
secure random number generator like *_/dev/urandom_*. For example, `math/random`
from Golang or `random.random()` from Python are not suitable.
====

. Place that value in the `secret` field.

. Restart the API server:
+
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
# systemctl restart origin-openshift-master-api origin-openshift-master-controllers
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api
----
endif::[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The encryption provider configuration file contains keys that can decrypt
content in etcd, so you must properly restrict permissions on masters so only
the user who runs the master API server can read it.
====

[[encrypting-data-verification]]
== Verifying that Data is Encrypted

Data is encrypted when written to etcd. After restarting the API server, any newly created or
updated secrets should be encrypted when stored. To check, you can use the `etcdctl` command line
program to retrieve the contents of your secret.

. Create a new secret called `secret1` in the `default` namespace:
+
----
$ oc create secret generic secret1 -n default --from-literal=mykey=mydata
----

. Using the `etcdctl` command line, read that secret out of etcd:
+
----
$ ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl get /kubernetes.io/secrets/default/secret1 -w fields [...] | grep Value
----
+
`[...]` must be the additional arguments for connecting to the etcd server.
+
The final command will look similar to:
+
----
$ ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl get /kubernetes.io/secrets/default/secret1 -w fields \
--cacert=/var/lib/origin/openshift.local.config/master/ca.crt \
--key=/var/lib/origin/openshift.local.config/master/master.etcd-client.key \
--cert=/var/lib/origin/openshift.local.config/master/master.etcd-client.crt \
--endpoints 'https://127.0.0.1:4001' | grep Value
----

. Verify that the output of the command above is prefixed with *k8s:enc:aescbc:v1:* which
indicates the *aescbc* provider has encrypted the resulting data.

. Verify the secret is correctly decrypted when retrieved via the API:
+
----
$ oc get secret secret1 -n default -o yaml | grep mykey
----
+
This should match *mykey: bXlkYXRh*.

[[encrypting-data-migration]]
== Ensure All Secrets are Encrypted

Since secrets are encrypted when written, performing an update on a secret will
encrypt that content.

----
$ oc adm migrate storage --include=secrets --confirm
----

This command reads all secrets, then updates them to apply server-side
encryption. If an error occurs due to a conflicting write, retry the command.

For larger clusters, you can subdivide the secrets by namespace or script an
update.

[[encrypting-data-rotation]]
== Rotating a Decryption Key

Changing the secret without incurring downtime requires a multi-step operation,
especially in the presence of a highly available deployment where multiple API
servers are running.

. Generate a new key and add it as the second key entry for the current provider
on all servers.

. Restart all API servers to ensure each server can decrypt using the new key.
+
[NOTE]
====
If using a single API server, you can skip this step.
====
+
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
# systemctl restart origin-master-api origin-master-controllers
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api
----
endif::[]

. Make the new key the first entry in the `keys` array so that it is used for
encryption in the configuration.

. Restart all API servers to ensure each server now encrypts using the new
key.
+
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
# systemctl restart origin-master-api origin-master-controllers
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api
----
endif::[]

. Run the following to encrypt all existing secrets with the new key:
+
----
$ oc adm migrate storage --include=secrets --confirm
----

. After you back up etcd with the new key in use and update all secrets, remove
the old decryption key from the configuration.

[[encrypting-data-decryption]]
== Decrypting Data

To disable encryption at the datastore layer:

. Place the *identity* provider as the first entry in the configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: EncryptionConfig
apiVersion: v1
resources:
  - resources:
    - secrets
    providers:
    - identity: {}
    - aescbc:
        keys:
        - name: key1
          secret: <BASE 64 ENCODED SECRET>
----

. Restart all API servers:
+
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
# systemctl restart origin-master-api origin-master-controllers
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api
----
endif::[]

. Run the following to force all secrets to be decrypted:
+
----
$ oc adm migrate storage --include=secrets --confirm
----
