== System Requirements

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
You must have an active OpenShift Enterprise subscription on your Red Hat
account to proceed. If you do not, contact your sales representative for more
information.

[[security-warning]]
*Security Warning*

OpenShift runs
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/containers_and_images.html#containers[Docker
containers] on your hosts, and in some cases, such as build operations and the
registry service, it does so using privileged containers. Furthermore, those
containers access your host's Docker daemon and perform `docker build` and
`docker push` operations. As such, you should be aware of the inherent security
risks associated with performing `docker run` operations on arbitrary images as
they effectively have root access.

For more information, see these articles:

- http://opensource.com/business/14/7/docker-security-selinux
- https://docs.docker.com/articles/security/

To address these risks, OpenShift uses
link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#security-context-constraints[security
context constraints] that control the actions that pods can perform and what it
has the ability to access.

== Environment Requirements
*DNS*

A wildcard for a DNS zone must ultimately resolve to the IP address of the
OpenShift link:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.html#routers[router].

For example, create a wildcard DNS entry for *cloudapps*, or something similar,
that has a low TTL and points to the public IP address of the host where the
router will be deployed:

----
*.cloudapps.example.com. 300 IN  A 192.168.133.2
----

In almost all cases, when referencing VMs you must use host names, and the host
names that you use must match the output of the `hostname -f` command on each
node.

*Networking*

A shared network must exist between the master and node hosts.

*Git*

You must have either Internet access and a GitHub account, or read and write
access to an internal, HTTP-based Git server.

== Host Preparation
Before installing OpenShift, you must first prepare each host per the following.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[NOTE]
====
If you are using https://www.vagrantup.com[Vagrant] to run OpenShift Origin, you
do not need to go through the following sections. These changes are only
necessary when you are setting up the host yourself. If you are using Vagrant,
see the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#develop-on-virtual-machine-using-vagrant[Contributing
Guide], then you can skip directly to trying out the
link:../../getting_started/administrators.html#try-it-out[sample applications].
====
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]

=== Software Prerequisites
*Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7*

A base installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.1 is required for
master or node hosts. See the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/index.html[Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 Installation Guide] for more information.

*Registering the Hosts*

Each host must be registered using Red Hat Subscription Manager (RHSM) and have
an active OpenShift Enterprise subscription attached to access the required
packages.

. On each host, register with RHSM:
+
----
# subscription-manager register --username=<user_name> --password=<password>
----

. List the available subscriptions:
+
----
# subscription-manager list --available
----

. In the output for the previous command, find the pool ID for an OpenShift
Enterprise subscription and attach it:
+
----
# subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id>
----

. Disable all repositories and enable only the required ones:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --disable="*"
# subscription-manager repos \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-optional-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.0-rpms"
----
endif::[]

*Managing Base Packages*

. Remove *NetworkManager*:
+
----
# yum remove NetworkManager*
----

. Install the following packages:
+
----
# yum install wget git net-tools bind-utils iptables-services bridge-utils
----

. Update the system to the latest packages:
+
----
# yum update
----

*Installing Docker*

Docker version 1.6.2 or later
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
from the *rhel-7-server-ose-3.0-rpms* repository
endif::[]
must be installed and running on master and node hosts before installing
OpenShift.

. Install Docker:
+
----
# yum install docker
----

. Edit the *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* file and add `--insecure-registry
172.30.0.0/16` to the `*OPTIONS*` parameter. For example:
+
----
OPTIONS=--selinux-enabled --insecure-registry 172.30.0.0/16
----
+
The `--insecure-registry` option instructs the Docker daemon to trust any Docker
registry on the *172.30.0.0/16* subnet, rather than requiring a certificate.

[NOTE]
====
After installing OpenShift, you can choose to
link:docker_registry.html#securing-the-registry[secure the integrated Docker
registry], which involves adjusting the `--insecure-registry` option
accordingly.
====

[[configuring-docker-storage]]
=== Configuring Docker Storage

Docker containers and the images they are created from are stored in Docker's
storage backend. This storage is ephemeral and separate from any persistent
storage allocated to meet the needs of your applications. The default storage
backend is loopback which  is not supported for production use and only
appropriate for proof of concept environments. For production environments
you must create a thin-pool logical volume and re-configure Docker to use
that volume.

You can use the *docker-storage-setup* script to create a thin-pool device and
configure Docker's storage driver after installing Docker but before creating
images or containers. The script reads configuration options from the
*_/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup_* file and supports three options for
creating the logical volume:

- *Option A)* Use an additional block device
- *Option B)* Use a specified volume group
- *Option C)* Use the remaining free space from the volume group where your root
filesystem is located

Option A is the most robust option however it requires adding an additional
block device. Options B and C both require leaving free space available when
provisioning your host.

[NOTE]
====
See the https://access.redhat.com/articles/1492923["Managing Storage with Docker
Formatted Containers on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Enterprise Linux
Atomic Host"] Knowledgebase article for more details about
*docker-storage-setup* and basic instructions on storage management in Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 7.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before using Docker or OpenShift please verify that the docker-pool logical
volume is large enough to meet your needs. The docker-pool volume should be
60% of the available volume group and will grow to fill the volume group
via LVM monitoring.
====


. Create the docker-pool volume using one of the following three options:

** [[docker-storage-a]]*Option A) Use an additional block device*
+
In *_/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup_* set *DEVS* to the path of the block
device you wish to use. Set *VG* to the volume group name you wish to create,
*docker-vg* is a reasonable choice. Run *docker-storage-setup* and review the
output to ensure the *docker-pool* volume was created.
+

[reconfiguring-docker-storage]
*Reconfiguring Docker Storage*

Should you need to re-configure storage after having created the docker-pool
you should remove the docker-pool logical volume. If you're using a
dedicated volume group you should also remove the volume group and any
associated physical volumes before re-configuring docker-storage-setup
according to the instructions above.

== Host Access for Ansible-based Installations

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
If you plan to use the link:advanced_install.html[advanced installation] method,
Ansible requires a user that has access to all hosts.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Ansible, which is used to run OpenShift Enterprise installations, requires a
user that has access to all hosts.
endif::[]
For running the Ansible-based installer as a non-root user, passwordless *sudo*
rights must also be configured on each destination host.

For example, you can generate an SSH key on the host where you will invoke the
installation process:

----
# ssh-keygen
----

Do *not* use a password.

An easy way to distribute your SSH keys is by using a `bash` loop:

----
# for host in master.example.com \
    node1.example.com \
    node2.example.com; \
    do ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub $host; \
    done
----

Modify the host names in the above command according to your configuration.

== What's Next?

Now that your environment and hosts are properly set up, you can install
OpenShift Enterprise using the
