== Overview
The OpenShift link:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.html[router] is the
ingress point for all external traffic destined for
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services[services]
in your OpenShift installation. An
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.html#haproxy-template-router[HAProxy
template router implementation] is provided as the default template router
plug-in. It uses the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*openshift3/ose-haproxy-router*
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*openshift/origin-haproxy-router*
endif::[]
 image to run an
HAProxy instance alongside the template router plug-in inside a container
on OpenShift. It currently supports HTTP(S) traffic and TLS-enabled
traffic via SNI.

The default router's
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*openshift3/ose-haproxy-router*
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*openshift/origin-haproxy-router*
endif::[]
 container listens on
the host network interface, unlike most containers that listen only on private
IPs. The router proxies external requests for route names to the IPs of actual
pods identified by the service associated with the route.

== Deploying the Default HAProxy Router
The `oadm router` command is provided with the administrator CLI to simplify the
tasks of setting up routers in a new installation. Just about every form of
communication between OpenShift components is secured by TLS and uses various
certificates and authentication methods. Use the `--credentials` option to
specify what credentials the router should use to contact the master.

To check if the default router, named *router*, already exists:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
$ oadm router --dry-run \
    --credentials='/etc/openshift/master/openshift-router.kubeconfig' \
    --images='registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-${component}:${version}'
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
$ oadm router --credentials="$KUBECONFIG" --dry-run
----
endif::[]

To see what the default router would look like if created:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
$ oadm router -o yaml \
    --credentials='/etc/openshift/master/openshift-router.kubeconfig' \
    --images='registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-${component}:${version}'
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
$ oadm router -o yaml --credentials="$KUBECONFIG"
----
endif::[]

To create a router if it does not exist:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
$ oadm router <router_name> --replicas=<number> \
    --credentials='/etc/openshift/master/openshift-router.kubeconfig' \
    --images='registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-${component}:${version}'
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
$ oadm router <router_name> --replicas=<number> \
    --credentials="$KUBECONFIG"
----
endif::[]

Multiple instances are created on different hosts according to the
link:../scheduler.html[scheduler policy].

To use a different router image and view the router configuration that would be used:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
$ oadm router <router_name> -o <format> --images=<image> \
    --credentials='/etc/openshift/master/openshift-router.kubeconfig'
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
$ oadm router <router_name> -o <format> --images=<image> \
    --credentials="$KUBECONFIG"
----
endif::[]


For example:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
====
----
$ oadm router region-west -o yaml --images=myrepo/somerouter:mytag \
    --credentials='/etc/openshift/master/openshift-router.kubeconfig'
----
====
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
====
----
$ oadm router region-west -o yaml --images=myrepo/somerouter:mytag \
    --credentials="$KUBECONFIG"
----
====
endif::[]

=== High Availability
You can link:../high_availability.html[set up a highly-available
router] on your OpenShift cluster using IP failover.

=== Using Wildcard DNS

A TLS-enabled route that does not include a certificate uses the router's
default certificate instead. In most cases, this certificate should be provided by a
trusted certificate authority, but for convenience you can use the OpenShift CA
to create the certificate. For example:

====
----
$ CA=/etc/openshift/master
$ oadm create-server-cert --signer-cert=$CA/ca.crt \
      --signer-key=$CA/ca.key --signer-serial=$CA/ca.serial.txt \
      --hostnames='*.cloudapps.example.com' \
      --cert=cloudapps.crt --key=cloudapps.key
----
====

The router expects the ceritifcate and key to be in PEM format in a single
file:

====
----
$ cat cloudapps.crt cloudapps.key $CA/ca.crt > cloudapps.router.pem
----
====

From there you can use the `--default-cert` flag:

====
----
$ oadm router --default-cert=cloudapps.router.pem \
--images=myrepo/somerouter:mytag --credentials="$KUBECONFIG"
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Browsers only consider wildcards valid for subdomains one
level deep. So in this example, the certificate would be valid for
_a.cloudapps.example.com_ but not for _a.b.cloudapps.example.com_.

*Special Note About Secured Routes*

Currently, password protected key files are not supported. HAProxy prompts
for a password upon starting and does not have a way to automate this process.
To remove a passphrase from a keyfile, you can run:

----
# openssl rsa -in <passwordProtectedKey.key> -out <new.key>
----

== Deploying a Customized HAProxy Router

The HAProxy router is based on a
link:http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/[*golang* template] that
generates the HAProxy configuration file from a list of routes. If you
want a customized template router to meet your needs, you can customize
the template file, build a new docker image, and run a customized router.

One common case for this might be implementing new features within the
application back ends. For example, it might be desirable in a highly-available
setup to use stick-tables that synchronizes between peers. The router plug-in
provides all the facilities necessary to make this customization.

.Using Stick Tables

*Adding a Peer Section*

In order to synchronize stick-tables amongst peers you must a define a peers
section in your HAProxy configuration. This section determines how HAProxy
will identify and connect to peers. The plug-in provides data to the template
under the `*.PeerEndpoints*` variable to allow you to easily identify members
of the router service. You may add a peer section to the *_haproxy-config.template_*
inside the router image by adding:

----
{{ if (len .PeerEndpoints) gt 0 }}
peers openshift_peers
  {{ range $endpointID, $endpoint := .PeerEndpoints }}
    peer {{$endpoint.TargetName}} {{$endpoint.IP}}:1937
  {{ end }}
{{ end }}
----

*Changing the Reload Script*

When using stick-tables, you have the option of telling HAProxy what it should
consider the name of the local host in the peer section. When creating
endpoints, the plug-in attempts to set the `*TargetName*` to the value of the
endpoint's `*TargetRef.Name*`. If `*TargetRef*` is not set, it will set the
`*TargetName*` to the IP address. The `*TargetRef.Name*` corresponds with the
Kubernetes host name, therefore you can add the `-L` option to the
`reload-haproxy` script to identify the local host in the peer section.

----
peer_name=$HOSTNAME <1>

if [ -n "$old_pid" ]; then
  /usr/sbin/haproxy -f $config_file -p $pid_file -L $peer_name -sf $old_pid
else
  /usr/sbin/haproxy -f $config_file -p $pid_file -L $peer_name
fi
----
<1> Must match an endpoint target name that is used in the peer section.

*Modifying Back Ends*

Finally, to use the stick-tables within back ends, you can modify the HAProxy
configuration to use the stick-tables and peer set. The following is an example
of changing the existing back end for TCP connections to use stick-tables:

----

            {{ if eq $cfg.TLSTermination "passthrough" }}
backend be_tcp_{{$cfgIdx}}
  balance leastconn
  timeout check 5000ms
  stick-table type ip size 1m expire 5m{{ if (len $.PeerEndpoints) gt 0 }} peers openshift_peers {{ end }}
  stick on src
                {{ range $endpointID, $endpoint := $serviceUnit.EndpointTable }}
  server {{$endpointID}} {{$endpoint.IP}}:{{$endpoint.Port}} check inter 5000ms
                {{ end }}
            {{ end }}
----

*Rebuilding Your Router*

After you have made modifications to the router you must rebuild the docker
image and push it to your repository. Then you can specify your new image when
creating a router either in the pod's object definition directly or by using the
`oadm router` command:

====
----
$ oadm router --credentials="$KUBECONFIG" --images=myrepo/myimage:mytag
----
====

== What's Next?

After you have a router deployed, you can learn more about
link:../router.html[monitoring the HAProxy router].

If you have not yet done so, you can:

- link:../configuring_authentication.html[Configure authentication]; by default,
authentication is set to
link:../configuring_authentication.html#DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider[Deny
All].
- Deploy an link:docker_registry.html[integrated Docker registry].
- link:first_steps.html[Populate your OpenShift installation] with a useful set
of Red Hat-provided image streams and templates.
