== Overview
For production environments, a reference configuration implemented using
http://www.ansible.com[Ansible] playbooks is available as the _advanced
installation_ method for installing OpenShift hosts. Familiarity with Ansible is
assumed.

Alternatively, you can use the link:quick_install.html[quick installation]
method for trial installations.

== Prerequisites

[[default-hosts]]
The following is an example host environment:

[options="header"]
|===

|Host Name |Infrastructure Component to Install

|*master.example.com*
|link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#master[Master]
and
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#node[node]

|*node1.example.com*
|Node

|*node2.example.com*
|Node
|===

Any hosts you designate as masters during the installation process should also
be configured as nodes that are marked
link:../../admin_guide/manage_nodes.html#marking-nodes-as-unschedulable-or-schedulable[unschedulable].
This is so the masters are configured as part of the
link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/networking.html#openshift-sdn[OpenShift
SDN].

Modify the domain and host names in the following instructions as needed for
your environment.

Before installing OpenShift, you must first link:prerequisites.html[satisfy the
prerequisites] on your hosts, which includes verifying system and environment
requirements and properly installing and configuring Docker. After following the
instructions in the link:prerequisites.html[Prerequisites] topic, you can
continue to link:#installing-ansible[installing Ansible].

== Installing Ansible [[installing-ansible]]
OpenShift's installation process is based on Ansible playbooks. The advanced
installation method requires invoking Ansible directly. You can get Ansible from
the EPEL repository.

Install the EPEL repository:

----
# yum -y install \
    http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-5.noarch.rpm
----

Disable the EPEL repository so that it is not accidentally used during later
steps of the installation:

----
# sed -i -e "s/^enabled=1/enabled=0/" /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo
----

Install the packages for Ansible:

----
# yum -y --enablerepo=epel install ansible
----

== Cloning the Ansible Repository
The configuration files for the Ansible installer are currently available
https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/tree/v3.0.0[on Github]. Clone the
repository:

----
# cd ~
# git clone https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible
# cd openshift-ansible
----
////
Removing this line til we have a better instruction:
# git checkout -b 3.x v3.0.0
////

== Configuring Ansible

You must create an *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file for the playbook to use during
the installation. The following is an example of a Bring Your Own (BYO) host
inventory, based on the link:#default-hosts[example host environment]. You can
see these example hosts present in both the *[masters]* and *[nodes]* sections:

====

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
# Create an OSEv3 group that contains the masters and nodes groups
[OSEv3:children]
masters
nodes

# Set variables common for all OSEv3 hosts
[OSEv3:vars]
# SSH user, this user should allow ssh based auth without requiring a password
ansible_ssh_user=root

# If ansible_ssh_user is not root, ansible_sudo must be set to true
#ansible_sudo=true

# To deploy origin, change deployment_type to origin
deployment_type=enterprise

# enable htpasswd authentication
openshift_master_identity_providers=[{'name': 'htpasswd_auth', 'login': 'true', 'challenge': 'true', 'kind': 'HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider', 'filename': '/etc/openshift/openshift-passwd'}]

# host group for masters
[masters]
master.example.com

# host group for nodes, includes region info
[nodes]
master.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'infra', 'zone': 'default'}"
node1.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'east'}"
node2.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'west'}"
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
# Create a group that contains the masters and nodes groups
[OSEv3:children]
masters
nodes

# Set variables common for all hosts
[OSEv3:vars]
# SSH user, this user should allow ssh based auth without requiring a password
ansible_ssh_user=root

# If ansible_ssh_user is not root, ansible_sudo must be set to true
#ansible_sudo=true

# To deploy origin, change deployment_type to origin
deployment_type=origin

# enable htpasswd authentication
openshift_master_identity_providers=[{'name': 'htpasswd_auth', 'login': 'true', 'challenge': 'true', 'kind': 'HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider', 'filename': '/etc/openshift/openshift-passwd'}]

# host group for masters
[masters]
master.example.com

# host group for nodes, includes region info
[nodes]
master.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'infra', 'zone': 'default'}"
node1.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'east'}"
node2.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'west'}"
----
endif::[]
====

Modify the file to your specifications and save it as *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*.

== Running the Ansible Installer

You can now run the Ansible installer:

----
# ansible-playbook ~/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/config.yml
----

After the installer completes, you can verify that the master is started and
nodes are registered and reporting in *Ready* status by running the following as
*root*:

====
----
# oc get nodes

NAME                      LABELS                                                                     STATUS
master.example.com        kubernetes.io/hostname=master.example.com,region=infra,zone=default        Ready,SchedulingDisabled
node1.example.com         kubernetes.io/hostname=node1.example.com,region=primary,zone=east          Ready
node2.example.com         kubernetes.io/hostname=node2.example.com,region=primary,zone=west          Ready
----
====

== What's Next?

Now that you have a working OpenShift instance, you can:

- Deploy an link:docker_registry.html[integrated Docker registry].
- Deploy a link:deploy_router.html[router].
- link:first_steps.html[Populate your OpenShift installation] with a useful set
of Red Hat-provided image streams and templates.
- link:../configuring_authentication.html[Configure authentication]; by default,
authentication is set to
link:../configuring_authentication.html#DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider[Deny
All].
