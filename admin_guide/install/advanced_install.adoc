== Overview
For production environments, a reference configuration implemented using
http://www.ansible.com[Ansible] playbooks is available as the _advanced
installation_ method for installing OpenShift hosts. Familiarity with Ansible is
assumed, however you can use this configuration as a reference to create your
own implementation using the configuration management tool of your choosing.

Alternatively, you can use the link:quick_install.html[quick installation]
method for trial installations.

== Prerequisites

Before installing OpenShift, you must first link:prerequisites.html[satisfy the
prerequisites] on your hosts, which includes verifying system and environment
requirements per component type and properly installing and configuring Docker.

After following the
instructions in the link:prerequisites.html[Prerequisites] topic, you can
continue to link:#installing-ansible[installing Ansible].

[[installing-ansible]]

== Installing Ansible

The advanced installation method is based on Ansible playbooks and as such
requires invoking Ansible directly. Consult with your IT department to confirm
your organization's supported download instructions for Ansible.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Packages installed from the EPEL repository are not supported by Red Hat,
including the Ansible package. However, Red Hat supports the OpenShift
installation playbooks described in this topic. For more information on EPEL
support, see the https://access.redhat.com/solutions/410753[Red Hat
Knowledgebase] and
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#Is_EPEL_commercially_supported_by_Red_Hat.3F[EPEL
FAQ].
====
endif::[]

For convenience, the following steps are provided if you want to use EPEL as a
package source.

Install the EPEL repository:

----
# yum -y install \
    https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-5.noarch.rpm
----

Disable the EPEL repository globally so that it is not accidentally used during
later steps of the installation:

----
# sed -i -e "s/^enabled=1/enabled=0/" /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo
----

Install the packages for Ansible:

----
# yum -y --enablerepo=epel install ansible
----

[[cloning-the-ansible-repository]]

== Cloning the Ansible Repository

The configuration files for the Ansible installer are currently available
https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible[on Github]. Clone the
repository:

----
# cd ~
# git clone https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible
# cd openshift-ansible
----

[NOTE]
====
Be sure to stay on the *master* branch of the *openshift-ansible* repository for
the remaining instructions.
====

[[configuring-ansible]]

== Configuring Ansible

The *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file is Ansible's inventory file for the playbook to
use during the installation. The inventory file describes the configuration for
your OpenShift cluster. You must replace the default contents of the file with
your desired configuration.

The following sections describe commonly-used variables to set in your inventory
file during an advanced installation, followed by example inventory files you
can use as a starting point for your installation. The examples describe various
environment topographies, including
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#high-availability-masters[using
multiple masters for high availability]. You can choose an example that matches
your requirements, modify it to match your own environment, and use it as your
inventory file when link:#running-the-ansible-installer[running the Ansible
installer].

[NOTE]
====
Before running the Ansible installer, any hosts you intend to designate as
masters during the installation process should also be configured as
link:../../admin_guide/manage_nodes.html#marking-nodes-as-unschedulable-or-schedulable[unschedulable]
nodes, in order to configure the masters as part of the
link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/networking.html#openshift-sdn[OpenShift
SDN].
====

[[configuring-host-variables]]

*Configuring Host Variables*

To assign environment variables to hosts during the Ansible install, indicate
the desired variables in the *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file after the host entry in
the *[masters]* or *[nodes]* sections. For example:

====
----
[masters]
ec2-52-6-179-239.compute-1.amazonaws.com openshift_public_hostname=ose3-master.public.example.com
----
====

The following table describes variables for use with the Ansible installer that
can be assigned to individual host entries:

.Host Variables
[options="header"]
|===

|Variable |Purpose

|`*openshift_hostname*`
|This variable overrides the internal cluster host name for the system. Use this
when the system's default IP address does not resolve to the system host name.

|`*openshift_public_hostname*`
|This variable overrides the system's public host name. Use this for cloud
installations, or for hosts on networks using a network address translation
(NAT).

|`*openshift_ip*`
|This variable overrides the cluster internal IP address for the system. Use
this when using an interface that is not configured with the default route.

|`*openshift_public_ip*`
|This variable overrides the system's public IP address. Use this for cloud
installations, or for hosts on networks using a network address translation
(NAT).
|===

[[configuring-cluster-variables]]

*Configuring Cluster Variables*

To assign environment variables during the Ansible install that apply more
globally to your OpenShift cluster overall, indicate the desired variables in
the *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file on separate, single lines within the *[OSEv3:vars]*
section. For example:

====
----
[OSEv3:vars]

openshift_master_identity_providers=[{'name': 'htpasswd_auth', 'login': 'true', 'challenge': 'true', 'kind': 'HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider', 'filename': '/etc/openshift/openshift-passwd'}]

osm_default_subdomain=apps.test.example.com
----
====

The following table describes variables for use with the Ansible installer that
can be assigned cluster-wide:

.Cluster Variables
[options="header", cols="1,2"]
|===

|Variable |Purpose

|`*ansible_ssh_user*`
|This variable sets the SSH user for the installer to use and defaults to
*root*. This user should allow SSH-based authentication
link:prerequisites.html#ensuring-host-access[without requiring a password]. If
using SSH key-based authentication, then the key should be managed by an SSH
agent.

|`*ansible_sudo*`
|If `*ansible_ssh_user*` is not *root*, this variable must be set to *true* and
the user must be configured for passwordless *sudo*.

|`*openshift_master_cluster_hostname*`
|This variable overrides the host name for the cluster, which defaults to the
host name of the master.

|`*openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname*`
|This variable overrides the public host name for the cluster, which defaults to
the host name of the master.

|`*openshift_master_identity_providers*`
|This variable overrides the link:../configuring_authentication.html[identity
provider], which defaults to
link:../configuring_authentication.html#DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider[Deny
All].

|`*osm_default_subdomain*`
|This variable overrides the default subdomain to use for exposed
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.html[routes].

|`*osm_default_node_selector*`
|This variable overrides the node selector that projects will use by default
when placing pods.
|===

[[configuring-node-host-labels]]

*Configuring Node Host Labels*

You can assign
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#labels[labels] to
node hosts during the Ansible install by configuring the *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*
file. Labels are useful for determining the placement of pods onto nodes using
the link:../scheduler.html#configurable-predicates[scheduler].

To assign labels to a node host during an Ansible install, use the
`*openshift_node_labels*` variable with the desired labels added to the desired
node host entry in the *[nodes]* section. For example:

====
----
[nodes]
node1.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'east'}"
----
====

[[single-master-multi-node]]

=== Single Master and Multiple Nodes

To use this example, modify the file to match your environment and
specifications, and save it as *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*.

Note the following when using this configuration:

- Installing multiple masters requires that you
link:#configuring-fencing[configure a fencing device] after running the
installer.
- When specifying multiple masters, the installer handles creating and starting
the high availability (HA) cluster. If during that process the `pcs status`
command indicates that an HA cluster already exists, the installer skips HA
cluster configuration.

== Running the Ansible Installer

After you've link:#configuring-ansible[configured Ansible] by defining an
inventory file in *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*, you can run the Ansible installer:

----
# ansible-playbook ~/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/config.yml
----

If for any reason the installation fails, before re-running the installer, see
link:#installer-known-issues[Known Issues] to check for any specific
instructions or workarounds.


[[configuring-fencing]]

== Configuring Fencing

If you installed OpenShift using a
link:#multi-master-multi-etcd-multi-node[configuration for multiple masters],
you must configure a fencing device. See
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/High_Availability_Add-On_Reference/ch-fencing-HAAR.html[Fencing:
Configuring STONITH] in the High Availability Add-on for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux documentation for instructions, then continue to
link:#verifying-the-installation[Verifying the Installation].

[[verifying-the-installation]]

== Verifying the Installation

After the installer completes, you can verify that the master is started and
nodes are registered and reporting in *Ready* status by running the following as
*root*:

====
----
# oc get nodes

NAME                      LABELS                                                                     STATUS
master.example.com        kubernetes.io/hostname=master.example.com,region=infra,zone=default        Ready,SchedulingDisabled
node1.example.com         kubernetes.io/hostname=node1.example.com,region=primary,zone=east          Ready
node2.example.com         kubernetes.io/hostname=node2.example.com,region=primary,zone=west          Ready
----
====

*Multiple etcd Hosts*

If you installed multiple *etcd* hosts:

. On a master host, verify the *etcd* cluster health, substituting for the FQDNs
of your *etcd* hosts in the following:
+
====
----
# etcdctl -C \
    https://etcd1.example.com:2379,https://etcd2.example.com:2379,https://etcd3.example.com:2379 \
    --ca-file=/etc/openshift/master/master.etcd-ca.crt \
    --cert-file=/etc/openshift/master/master.etcd-client.crt \
    --key-file=/etc/openshift/master/master.etcd-client.key cluster-health
----
====

. Also verify the member list is correct:
+
====
----
# etcdctl -C \
    https://etcd1.example.com:2379,https://etcd2.example.com:2379,https://etcd3.example.com:2379 \
    --ca-file=/etc/openshift/master/master.etcd-ca.crt \
    --cert-file=/etc/openshift/master/master.etcd-client.crt \
    --key-file=/etc/openshift/master/master.etcd-client.key member list
----
====

*Multiple Masters*

If you installed multiple masters:

. On a master host, determine which host is currently running as the active
master:
+
----
# pcs status
----

. After determining the active master, put the specified host into standby mode:
+
----
# pcs cluster standby <host1_name>
----

. Verify the master is now running on another host:
+
----
# pcs status
----

. After verifying the master is running on another node, re-enable the host on standby for normal operation by running:
+
----
# pcs cluster unstandby <host1_name>
----

Red Hat recommends that you also verify your installation by consulting the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html-single/High_Availability_Add-On_Reference/index.html[High
Availability Add-on for Red Hat Enterprise Linux documentation].

[[installer-known-issues]]

== Known Issues

The following are known issues for specified installation configurations.

*Multiple Masters*

- On failover, it is possible for the controller manager to overcorrect, which
causes the system to run more pods than what was intended. However, this is a
transient event and the system does correct itself over time. See
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/issues/10030 for details.

- On failure of the Ansible installer, you must start from a clean operating
system installation. If you are using virtual machines, start from a fresh
image. If you are use bare metal machines:
+
. Run the following on a master host:
+
----
# pcs cluster destroy --all
----
+
. Then, run the following on all node hosts:
+
----
# yum -y remove openshift openshift-* etcd docker

# rm -rf /etc/openshift /var/lib/openshift /etc/etcd \
    /var/lib/etcd /etc/sysconfig/openshift* /etc/sysconfig/docker* \
    /root/.kube/config /etc/ansible/facts.d /usr/share/openshift
