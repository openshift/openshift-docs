== Overview

In {product-title}, you can _restore_ your cluster and its components by
recreating cluster elements, including nodes and applications, from separate storage.

To restore a cluster, you must first xref:../day_two_guide/environment_backup.adoc#day_two_environment_backup[back it up].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The following process describes a generic way of restoring applications and the
{product-title} cluster. It cannot take into account custom requirements. You 
might need to take additional actions to restore your cluster.

== Adding an etcd node

After you restore etcd, you can add more etcd nodes to the cluster. You can 
either add an etcd host by using an Ansible playbook or by manual steps.

== Restoring Persistent Volume Claims

This topic describes two methods for restoring data. The first involves deleting
the file, then placing the file back in the expected location. The second
example shows migrating persistent volume claims. The migration would occur in
the event that the storage needs to be moved or in a disaster scenario when the
backend storage no longer exists.

Check with the restore procedures for the specific application on any steps
required to restore data to the application.
