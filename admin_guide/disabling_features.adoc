As an administrator, you can turn off specific features to specific nodes or to the entire platform
using _feature gates_.

For example, you can turn off new features for production clusters while leaving the features on for test clusters where you can 
fully test them. 

If you disable a feature that appears in the web console, you might see that feature, but
no objects are listed. For example, if you disable builds, you can see the *Builds* tab in the web console, but there are no builds present. 

If you attempt to use commands associated with a disabled feature, such as `oc start-build`, {product-title}
displays an error.

[NOTE]
====
If you disable a feature that any application in the cluster relies on, the application might not
function properly, depending upon the feature disabled and how the application uses that feature.
====

Feature gates use a `key=value` pair in the master configuration file
(*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*) and the 
and node configuration files that describe the feature you want to block.

For example, the following code turns off the Huge Pages feature:

[source,yaml]
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  apiServerArguments:
    feature-gates:
    - HugePages=false <1>
  ... 
  controllerArguments:
    feature-gates:
    - HugePages=false <1>
----

<1> A key/value pair that turns off a feature:
+
* `true` enables the specified feature
+
* `false` disables the specified feature

[[admin-guide-disable-feature-cluster]]
== Disabling Features for a Cluster

To turn off a feature for the entire cluster, edit the master configuration file, by default *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*:

. For the feature you want to turn off, enter: `<feature_name>=false` under `apiServerArguments` and `controllerArguments`. 
+
For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  apiServerArguments:
    feature-gates:
    - HugePages=false
  controllerArguments:
    feature-gates:
    - HugePages=false
----

. Restart the {product-title} master service to apply the changes.
+
----
# master-restart api
# master-restart controllers
----

[[admin-guide-disable-feature-node]]
== Disabling Features for a Node

To turn off a feature for the entire cluster, edit the *_node-config.yaml_*, by default _/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml_:

. For the feature you want to turn off, enter: `<feature_name>=false` under`proxyArguments`.
+
For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
proxyArguments:
  feature-gates:
  - HugePages=false
----

. Restart the {product-title} service for the changes to take effect:
+
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
# systemctl restart origin-node
----
endif::[]

To re-enable a disabled feature, edit the master and node configuration files to remove the `<feature_name>=false`
and restart the master and node services.
