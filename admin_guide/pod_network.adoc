== Overview
As a cluster administrator of OpenShift, you can manage pod overlay network for the projects.

== Join Project Network
Allows projects to join existing project network when using the link:../architecture/additional_concepts/sdn.html#multitenant-plugin[multitenant] network plugin.

----
$ oadm pod-network join-projects --to=<project1> <project2> <project3>
----
In this case, all the pods and services in _<project2>_ and _<project3>_ can access any pods and services in _<project1>_ and vice versa.

Alternatively, instead of specifying specific project names (e.g., `_<project2>_ _<project3>_`), you can use the `--selector=_<project_selector>_` option.

== Make Project Network Global
Allows projects to access all pods and services in the cluster. Also all pods and services in the cluster can reach the selected projects when using the link:../architecture/additional_concepts/sdn.html#multitenant-plugin[multitenant] network plugin.

----
$ oadm pod-network make-projects-global <project1> <project2>
----
In this case, all the pods and services in _<project1>_ and _<project2>_ can access any pods and services in the cluster and vice versa.

Alternatively, instead of specifying specific project names (e.g., `_<project1>_ _<project2>_`), you can use the `--selector=_<project_selector>_` option.
