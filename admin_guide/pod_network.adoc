link:../architecture/additional_concepts/sdn.html[the *ovs-multitenant* SDN
plug-in], you can manage the separate pod overlay networks for projects using
the administrator CLI.

[[joining-project-networks]]
== Joining Project Networks

To join projects to an existing project network:

----
$ oadm pod-network join-projects --to=<project1> <project2> <project3>
----

In the above example, all the pods and services in `<project2>` and `<project3>`
can now access any pods and services in `<project1>` and vice versa.

Alternatively, instead of specifying specific project names, you can use the
`--selector=<project_selector>` option.

[[making-project-networks-global]]
== Making Project Networks Global

To allow projects to access all pods and services in the cluster and vice versa:

----
$ oadm pod-network make-projects-global <project1> <project2>
----

In the above example, all the pods and services in `<project1>` and `<project2>`
can now access any pods and services in the cluster and vice versa.

Alternatively, instead of specifying specific project names, you can use the
`--selector=<project_selector>` option.
