== Overview
{product-title} uses xref:../dev_guide/builds/triggering_builds.adoc#image-change-triggers[image
change triggers] in a `BuildConfig` to detect when an
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-stream-tag[image
stream tag] has been updated. You can use the `oc adm build-chain` command to
build a dependency tree that identifies which
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/containers_and_images.adoc#docker-images[images]
would be affected by updating an image in a specified
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[image
stream].

The `build-chain` tool can determine which
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#builds[builds]
to trigger; it analyzes the output of those builds to determine if they will in
turn update another
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-stream-tag[image
stream tag]. If they do, the tool continues to follow the dependency tree.
Lastly, it outputs a graph specifying the image stream tags
that would be impacted by an update to the top-level tag. The default output
syntax for this tool is set to a human-readable format; the DOT format is also
supported.

== Usage

The following table describes common `build-chain` usage and general syntax:

.Common `build-chain` Operations
[cols=".^5,.^5a",options="header"]
|===

|Description |Syntax

|Build the dependency tree for the *latest* tag in `<image-stream>`.
|----
$ oc adm build-chain <image-stream>
----

|Build the dependency tree for the *v2* tag in DOT format, and visualize it
using the DOT utility.
|----
$ oc adm build-chain <image-stream>:v2 \
    -o dot \
    \| dot -T svg -o deps.svg
----

|Build the dependency tree across all projects for the specified image stream
tag found the *test* project.
|----
$ oc adm build-chain <image-stream>:v1 \
    -n test --all
----

[NOTE]
====
You may need to install the *graphviz* package to use the `dot` command.
