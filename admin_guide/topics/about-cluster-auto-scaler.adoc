= About the {product-title} auto-scaler

The auto-scaler in {product-title} periodically, such as every
30 seconds, checks to see how many pods are pending node allocation. If nodes
are pending allocation and the auto-scaler has not met its maximum capacity,
then new nodes are continuously provisioned to accommodate the current
demand. When demand drops and fewer pods are required, the auto-scaler removes
unused nodes.

In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can deploy the auto-scaler
in only clouds that run on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The auto-scaler uses some
standard AWS objects to manage your cluster size, including Auto Scaling groups
and Launch Configurations.

The auto-scaler uses the following assets:

Auto Scaling groups::
An Auto Scaling group (ASG) is a logical representation of a set of machines. 
You configure an ASG with a minimum number of instances to run, the maximum
number of instances that can run, and your desired number of instances to run.
An ASG starts by launching enough instances to meet your desired capacity. 
You can start an ASGs with a minimum of zero instances.

Launch Configurations::
A Launch Configuration (LC) is a template that an ASG uses to launch
instances; you specify information such as the ID of the Amazon
Machine Image (AMI); the instance type, such as *m4.large*; a key pair;
one or more security groups; or subnets.

{product-title} primed images::
When the ASG provisions a new instance, the image that runs must have
{product-name} already prepared. The ASG uses this image to both automatically
bootstrap the node and enroll it within the cluster without manual
intervention.
