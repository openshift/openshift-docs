= Methods of installing the auto-scaler

You can create a {product-title} cluster in Amazon Web Service (AWS) with the
auto-scaler enabled or add the auto-scaler to an existing cluster in AWS.

* You can install the auto-scaler automatically by using the AWS Ansible
playbooks. You can automatically install the auto-scaler when creating a new
cluster, which provisions new {product-title} nodes in AWS and configures the
auto-scaler, or you can update a cluster to include the auto-scaler by running
the playbook again.

* If you used the `deploy_cluster.yaml` playbook to deploy your cluster in AWS, 
you can manually create an Auto Scaling group and launch configuration file and
manually deploy the auto-scaler components by using the 
openshift-cluster-autoscaler Ansible playbooks.
