= Creating a single-node etcd cluster

To restore the full functionality of your {product-title} instance, make a 
remaining etcd node a standalone etcd cluster.

[discrete]
== Procedure

. On the etcd node that you did not remove from the cluster, stop all etcd services:
+
----
# systemctl stop etcd.service
----

. Run the etcd service on the host, forcing a new cluster.
+
These commands create a custom file for the etcd service, which adds the 
`--force-new-cluster` option to the etcd start command:
+
----
# mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/etcd.service.d/
# echo "[Service]" > /etc/systemd/system/etcd.service.d/temp.conf
# echo "ExecStart=" >> /etc/systemd/system/etcd.service.d/temp.conf
# sed -n '/ExecStart/s/"$/ --force-new-cluster"/p' \
    /usr/lib/systemd/system/etcd.service \
    >> /etc/systemd/system/etcd.service.d/temp.conf

# systemctl daemon-reload
# master-restart etcd
----

. List the etcd member and confirm that the member list contains only your single
etcd host:
+
----
# etcdctl member list
165201190bf7f217: name=192.168.34.20 peerURLs=http://localhost:2380 clientURLs=https://master-0.example.com:2379 isLeader=true
----

. After restoring the data and creating a new cluster, you must update the 
`peerURLs` parameter value to use the IP address where etcd listens for peer 
communication:
+
----
# etcdctl member update 165201190bf7f217 https://192.168.34.20:2380 <1>
----
+
<1> `165201190bf7f217` is the member ID shown in
the output of the previous command, and `https://192.168.34.20:2380` is its IP
address.

. To verify, check that the IP is in the member list:
+
----
$ etcdctl2 member list
5ee217d17301: name=master-0.example.com peerURLs=https://*192.168.55.8*:2380 clientURLs=https://192.168.55.8:2379 isLeader=true
