= About pod priority

When the Pod Priority and Preemption feature is enabled, the scheduler orders pending pods by their priority, and a pending pod is placed ahead of other pending pods with lower priority in the scheduling queue. As a result, the higher priority pod might be scheduled sooner than pods with lower priority if its scheduling requirements are met. If a pod cannot be scheduled, scheduler continues to schedule other lower priority pods.

== Pod priority classes

You can assign pods a priority class, which is a non-namespaced object that defines a mapping from a name to the integer value of the priority. The higher the value, the higher the priority.

A priority class object can take any 32-bit integer value smaller than or equal to 1000000000 (one billion). Reserve numbers larger than one billion for critical pods that should not be preempted or evicted. By default, {product-title} has two reserved priority classes for critical system pods to have guaranteed scheduling.

* *System-node-critical* - This priority class has a value of 2000001000 and is used for all pods that should never be evicted from a node. Examples of pods that have this priority class are sdn-ovs, sdn, and so forth.

* *System-cluster-critical* - This priority class has a value of 2000000000 (two billion) and is used with pods that are important for the cluster. Pods with this priority class can be evicted from a node in certain circumstances. For example, pods configured with the `system-node-critical` priority class can take priority. However, this priority class does ensure guaranteed scheduling. Examples of pods that can have this priority class are fluentd, add-on components like descheduler, and so forth.

[NOTE]
====
If you upgrade your existing cluster, the priority of your existing pods is effectively zero. However, existing pods with 
the `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/critical-pod` annotation are automatically converted to `system-cluster-critical` class.

== Pod priority names

After you have one or more priority classes, you can create pods that specify a priority class name in a pod specification. The priority admission controller uses the priority class name field to populate the integer value of the priority. If the named priority class is not found, the pod is rejected.

The following YAML is an example of a pod configuration that uses the priority class created in the preceding example. The priority admission controller checks the specification and resolves the priority of the pod to 1000000.
