= Example Statefulset

A StatefulSet operates under the same pattern as any other Controller. You define your desired state in a StatefulSet object, 
and the StatefulSet controller makes any necessary updates to get there from the current state.

The following examples show the components of a StatefulSet.

* A headless service:

[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: frontend-headless  <1>
  labels:
    app: ruby-helloworld-sample
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    name: web
  clusterIP: None  <2>
  selector:
    app: ruby-helloworld-sample
----

<1> Name of the headless service.
<2> Setting `clusterIP` variable to `None` declares a headless service.
<3> Selects all pods that use the specified application.

* The StatefulSet:

[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ruby-helloworld-sample <1>
  serviceName: "ruby-helloworld"
  replicas: 3 <2>
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ruby-helloworld-sample <3>
    spec:
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 10
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: k8s.gcr.io/nginx-slim:0.8
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: ruby-helloworld
        volumeMounts:
        - name: www
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: www
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      storageClassName: "my-storage-class"
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
----

<1> The `app` has to match `.spec.template.metadata.labels`.
<2> Indicates the number of replicas of the container that will be launched in unique pods. This is 1 by default.
<2> The `app` has to match `.spec.selector.matchLabels`.

The output of the `oc get pods` command will look like the example below when all of the pods are created:

[source,bash]
----
oc get pods

NAME      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
web-0     0/1       Pending   0          0s
web-0     0/1       Pending   0         0s
web-0     0/1       ContainerCreating   0         0s
web-0     1/1       Running   0         19s
web-1     0/1       Pending   0         0s
web-1     0/1       Pending   0         0s
web-1     0/1       ContainerCreating   0         0s
web-1     1/1       Running   0         18s

The *web-1* pod does not launch until the *web-0* pod is Running and Ready.

The example above creates three Pods named `web-0`, `web-1`, and `web-2`. The domain managed by this Service takes the form: $(service name).$(namespace).svc.cluster.local, where “cluster.local” is the cluster domain. As each Pod is created, it gets a matching DNS subdomain, taking the form: $(podname).$(governing service domain), where the governing service is defined by the serviceName field on the StatefulSet.
