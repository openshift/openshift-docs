= Example Statefulset

A StatefulSet operates under the same pattern as any other Controller. You define your desired state in a StatefulSet object, 
and the StatefulSet controller makes any necessary updates to get there from the current state.

The following examples show the components of a StatefulSet.

. Configure a headless service:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx <1>
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    name: web
  clusterIP: None <2>
  selector:
    app: nginx <3>
----

<1> Name of the headless service.
<2> Setting `clusterIP` variable to `None` declares a headless service.
<3> Selects all pods that use the specified application.

. Create the service:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc create -f headless-service.yaml
----

. Configure a StatefulSet:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  serviceName: "nginx"
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx <1>
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx <2>
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: k8s.gcr.io/nginx-slim:0.8
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: web
        volumeMounts:
        - name: www
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: www
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
----

<1> The `app` has to match `.spec.template.metadata.labels`.
<2> The `app` has to match `.spec.selector.matchLabels`.

. Create the StaefulSet:
+
[source,bash]
----
# oc create -f statefulset.yaml
----

. Check that the objects were created:
+
[source,bash]
----
# oc get service nginx
NAME      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
nginx     ClusterIP   None         <none>        80/TCP    2m

# oc get statefulset web
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   AGE
web       3         1         2m
----

. Use the `oc get pods` command to view the pods that were created:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc get pods

kubectl get pods -w -l app=nginx
NAME      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
web-0     0/1       Pending   0          0s
web-0     0/1       Pending   0         0s
----


The *web-1* pod does not launch until the *web-0* pod is Running and Ready.

The example above creates three Pods named `web-0`, `web-1`, and `web-2`. The domain managed by this Service takes the form: $(service name).$(namespace).svc.cluster.local, where “cluster.local” is the cluster domain. As each Pod is created, it gets a matching DNS subdomain, taking the form: $(podname).$(governing service domain), where the governing service is defined by the serviceName field on the StatefulSet.
