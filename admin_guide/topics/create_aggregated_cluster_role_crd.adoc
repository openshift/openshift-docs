create aggregated cluster role definitions for a custom resource definition

This module contains xrefs. If you need to reuse it, make sure the links work
in your assembly. You might need to add a conditional statement to place the 
right link for your assembly.

= Creating cluster roles for the custom resource definition

After you create cluster-scoped CRDs, you can grant permissions to it. If you
use the admin, edit, and view 
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[default
cluster roles], take advantage of cluster role aggregation for their rules.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must explicitly assign permissions to each of these roles. The roles with
more permissions do not inherit rules from roles with fewer permissions. If you
assign a rule to a role, you must also assign that verb to roles that have more
permissions. For example, if you grant the "get crontabs" permission to the view
role, you must also grant it to the edit and admin roles. The admin or edit role 
is usually assigned to the user that created a project through the 
xref:../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#modifying-the-template-for-new-projects[project 
template].
====

. Create a cluster role definition file for the CRD. The cluster role definition is 
a YAML file that contains the rules that apply to each cluster role. The 
{product-title} controller adds the rules that you specify to the default cluster
roles.

<1> Use the `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1` API.
<2> Specify a name for the definition.
<3> Specify this label to grant permissions to the admin default role. 
<4> Specify this label to grant permissions to the edit default role. 
<5> Specify the group name of the CRD.
<6> Specify the plural name of the CRD that these rules apply to.
<7> Specify the xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#action[verbs]
that represent the permissions that are granted to the role. For example, apply 
read and write permissions to the admin and edit roles and only read permission
to the view role.
