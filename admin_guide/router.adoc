== Overview
Depending on the underlying implementation, you can monitor a running
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-routes[router] in multiple ways. This
topic discusses the HAProxy template router and the components to check to
ensure its health.

[[admin-guide-router-view-stats]]
== Viewing Statistics

The HAProxy router exposes a web listener for the HAProxy statistics. Enter the
router's public IP address and the correctly configured port (*1936* by default)
to view the statistics page. The administrator password and port are configured 
during the router installation, but they
can be found by viewing the *_haproxy.config_* file on the container.

To view HAProxy router stats:

. If needed, xref:../install_config/router/index.adoc#install-config-router-overview[create the router] 
using `--stats-port` to expose statistics on the specified port: 
+
----
$ oc adm router <name> --replicas=<number>  --service-account=router --selector='<zone>' --stats-port=<port>
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ oc adm router router --replicas=1  --selector='zone=west' --stats-port=1936 
----
+
[NOTE]
====
`-replicas` is the replication factor of the router; commonly 2 when high availability is desired.

`-selector` is used to filter nodes on deployment. Used to run routers on a specific set of nodes.
====
+
If you receive the following error, run the `oc adm policy add-scc-to-user hostnetwork -z <name>` command as suggested.
+
----
error: router could not be created; service account "router" is not allowed to access the host network on nodes, grant access with oc adm policy add-scc-to-user hostnetwork -z router
----

. Run the following command to get the router pod name:
+
----
oc get pod
NAME              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
router-1-deploy   0/1       Pending   0          48s
----

. If needed, run the following command to get the stats password that was assigned during router creation:
+
----
$ oc describe pod <pod-name> |grep STATS_PASSWORD
----
+
For example:
+
----
oc describe pod router-1-lt7xm |grep STATS_PASSWORD
      STATS_PASSWORD:				C1dSdUff00
----

. Run the following command to open iptables for the router stats port:
+
----
$ iptables -I OS_FIREWALL_ALLOW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 1936 -j ACCEPT
----
+
You can add this rule to *_/etc/sysconfig/iptables_* to keep the rule across reboots.
+
You can make this port accessible via xref:../dev_guide/port_forwarding.adoc#dev-guide-port-forwarding[port forwarding], if desired. 

. Use one of the following methods to view statistics:

** To launch the stats window, use the following URL in a browser:
+
----
http://admin:<stats-password>@<master-ip>:1936/haproxy_stats
----
+
For example:
+
----
http://admin:C1dSdUff00@master.example.com:1936
----
+
The statistics display in a table similar to the following:
+
image::HAProxy-stats.png["HAProxy statistics in a browser"]

** To generate a CSV output of the statistics, execute the following command on master:
+
----
$ cmd="echo 'show stat' | socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/var/lib/haproxy/run/haproxy.sock"
$ routerPod=$(oc get pods --selector="router=router"  \
    --template="{{with index .items 0}}{{.metadata.name}}{{end}}")
$ oc exec $routerPod -- bash -c "$cmd"
----
+
Statistics are output similar to the following:
+

[IMPORTANT]
====
link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015:1650[For security purposes], the
`oc exec` command does not work when accessing privileged containers. Instead,
you can SSH into a node host, then use the `docker exec` command on the desired
container.
====

[[admin-guide-router-disable-stats]]
== Disabling Statistics View

By default the HAProxy statistics are exposed on port *1936* (with a
password protected account). To disable exposing the HAProxy statistics,
specify *0* as the stats port number.

----
$ oc set env dc/router STATS_PORT=0
----

----
$ oc adm router hap --service-account=router --stats-port=0
----

[NOTE]
====
HAProxy will still collect and store statistics. However, the stats are
 _not_ exposed through a web listener. You can still get access to the CSV
statistics by sending a request to the HAProxy AF_UNIX socket inside
the HAProxy Router container as shown above.
====

[[admin-guide-router-view-logs]]
== Viewing Logs

To view a router log, run the `oc logs` command on the pod. Since the router is
running as a plug-in process that manages the underlying implementation, the log
is for the plug-in, not the actual HAProxy log.

To view the logs generated by HAProxy, start a syslog server and pass the
location to a router pod using the following environment variables.

.Router Syslog Variables [[syslog-vars]]
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Environment Variable | Description

|`*ROUTER_SYSLOG_ADDRESS*`
|The IP address of the syslog server. Port *514* is the default if no port is
specified.

|`*ROUTER_LOG_LEVEL*`
|Optional. Set to change the HAProxy log level. If not set, the default log
level is *warning*. This can be changed to any log level that HAProxy supports.
|===

To set a running router pod to send messages to a syslog server:
====
----
$ oc set env dc/router ROUTER_SYSLOG_ADDRESS=<dest_ip:dest_port>  ROUTER_LOG_LEVEL=<level>
----
====

For example, the following sets HAProxy to send logs to 127.0.0.1 with the
default port *514* and changes the log level to *debug*.

----
$ oc set env dc/router ROUTER_SYSLOG_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1 ROUTER_LOG_LEVEL=debug
----

[[admin-guide-router-view-internals]]
== Viewing the Router Internals

*routes.json*

Routes are processed by the HAProxy router, and are stored both in memory, on
disk, and in the HAProxy configuration file. The internal route representation,
which is passed to the template to generate the HAProxy configuration file, is
found in the *_/var/lib/haproxy/router/routes.json_* file. When
troubleshooting a routing issue, view this file to see the data being used to
drive configuration.

*HAProxy configuration*

You can find the HAProxy configuration and the backends that have been created
for specific routes in the *_/var/lib/haproxy/conf/haproxy.config_* file. The
mapping files are found in the same directory. The helper frontend and
backends use mapping files when mapping incoming requests to a backend.

*Certificates*

Certificates are stored in two places:

- Certificates for edge terminated and re-encrypt terminated routes are stored
in the *_/var/lib/haproxy/router/certs_* directory.
- Certificates that are used for connecting to backends for re-encrypt
terminated routes are stored in the *_/var/lib/haproxy/router/cacerts_*
directory.

The files are keyed by the namespace and name of the route. The key,
certificate, and CA certificate are concatenated into a single file. You can use
link:https://www.openssl.org/[OpenSSL] to view the contents of these files.
