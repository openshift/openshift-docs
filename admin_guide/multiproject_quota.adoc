== Overview

A multi-project quota, defined by a `*ClusterResourceQuota*` object, allows
xref:../admin_guide/quota.adoc#admin-guide-quota[quotas] to be shared across
multiple projects. Resources used in each selected project will be aggregated
and that aggregate will be used to limit resources across all the selected
projects.

[[multi-project-quotas-selecting-projects]]
== Selecting Projects

You can select projects based on annotation selection, label selection, or
both. For example, to select projects based on annotations, run the
following command:

[source, bash]
----
$ oc create clusterquota for-user \
     --project-annotation-selector openshift.io/requester=<user-name> \
     --hard pods=10 \
     --hard secrets=20
----

It creates the following `ClusterResourceQuota` object:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ClusterResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: for-user
spec:
  quota: <1>
    hard:
      pods: "10"
      secrets: "20"
  selector:
    annotations: <2>
      openshift.io/requester: <user-name>
    labels: null <3>
status:
  namespaces: <4>
  - namespace: ns-one
    status:
      hard:
        pods: "10"
        secrets: "20"
      used:
        pods: "1"
        secrets: "9"
  total: <5>
    hard:
      pods: "10"
      secrets: "20"
    used:
      pods: "1"
      secrets: "9"
----
<1> The `*ResourceQuotaSpec*` object that will be enforced over the selected projects.
<2> A simple key/value selector for annotations.
<3> A label selector that can be used to select projects.
<4> A per-namespace map that describes current quota usage in each selected project.
<5> The aggregate usage across all selected projects.

This multi-project quota document controls all projects requested by
*<user-name>* using the default project request endpoint. You are limited to 10
pods and 20 secrets.

Similarly, to select projects based on labels, run this command:

[source, bash]
----
$  oc create clusterresourcequota for-name \ <1>
    --project-label-selector=name=frontend \ <2>
    --hard=pods=10 --hard=secrets=20
----

<1> Both `clusterresourcequota` and `clusterquota` are aliases of the same
command. `for-name` is the name of the `clusterresourcequota` object.
<2> To select projects by label, provide a key-value pair by using the format `--project-label-selector=key=value`.

It creates the following `ClusterResourceQuota` object definition:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ClusterResourceQuota
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: for-name
spec:
  quota:
    hard:
      pods: "10"
      secrets: "20"
  selector:
    annotations: null
    labels:
      matchLabels:
        name: frontend
----

== Viewing Applicable `*ClusterResourceQuotas*`

A project administrator is not allowed to create or modify the multi-project
quota that limits his or her project, but the administrator is allowed to view the
multi-project quota documents that are applied to his or her project. The
project administrator can do this via the `*AppliedClusterResourceQuota*`
resource.

[source, bash]
----
$ oc describe AppliedClusterResourceQuota
----

produces:

[source, bash]
----
Name:   for-user
Namespace:  <none>
Created:  19 hours ago
Labels:   <none>
Annotations:  <none>
Label Selector: <null>
AnnotationSelector: map[openshift.io/requester:<user-name>]
Resource  Used  Hard
--------  ----  ----
pods        1     10
secrets     9     20
----

[[multi-project-quotas-selection-granularity]]
== Selection Granularity

Because of the locking consideration when claiming quota allocations, the number of
active projects selected by a multi-project quota is an important consideration.
Selecting more than 100 projects under a single multi-project quota may have
detrimental effects on API server responsiveness in those projects.
