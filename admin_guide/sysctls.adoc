== Overview

Sysctl settings are exposed via Kubernetes, allowing users to modify certain
kernel parameters at runtime for namespaces within a container. Only sysctls
that are namespaced can be set independently on pods; if a sysctl is not
namespaced (called _node-level_), it cannot be set within {product-title}.
Moreover, only those sysctls considered _safe_ are whitelisted by default; other
_unsafe_ sysctls can be manually enabled on the node to be available to the
user.

== Understanding Sysctls

In Linux, the sysctl interface allows an administrator to modify kernel
parameters at runtime. Parameters are available via the *_/proc/sys/_* virtual
process file system. The parameters cover various subsystems such as:

- kernel (common prefix: *_kernel._*)
- networking (common prefix: *_net._*)
- virtual memory (common prefix: *_vm._*)
- MDADM (common prefix: *_dev._*)

More subsystems are described in
link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/README[Kernel documentation]. To get a list of all parameters, you can run:

----
$ sudo sysctl -a
----

[[namespaced-vs-node-level-sysctls]]
== Namespaced Versus Node-Level Sysctls

A number of sysctls are _namespaced_ in todayâ€™s Linux kernels. This means that
they can be set independently for each pod on a node. Being namespaced is a
requirement for sysctls to be accessible in a pod context within Kubernetes.

The following sysctls are known to be namespaced:

- *_kernel.shm*_*
- *_kernel.msg*_*
- *_kernel.sem_*
- *_fs.mqueue.*_*
- *_net.*_*

Sysctls that are not namespaced are called _node-level_ and must be set
manually by the cluster administrator, either by means of the underlying Linux
distribution of the nodes (e.g., via *_/etc/sysctls.conf_*) or using a DaemonSet
with privileged containers.

[NOTE]
====
Consider marking nodes with special sysctls as tainted. Only schedule pods onto
them that need those sysctl settings. Use the
link:http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl/kubectl_taint/[Kubernetes _taints and toleration_ feature] to implement this.
====

[[safe-vs-unsafe-sysclts]]
== Safe Versus Unsafe Sysctls

Sysctls are grouped into _safe_ and _unsafe_ sysctls. In addition to proper
namespacing, a safe sysctl must be properly isolated between pods on the same
node. This means that setting a safe sysctl for one pod:

- must not have any influence on any other pod on the node,
- must not allow to harm the node's health, and
- must not allow to gain CPU or memory resources outside of the resource limits of
a pod.

By far, most of the namespaced sysctls are not necessarily considered safe.

For {product-title} 3.3.1, the following sysctls are supported (whitelisted) in
the safe set:

- *_kernel.shm_rmid_forced_*
- *_net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range_*

This list will be extended in future versions when the kubelet supports better
isolation mechanisms.

All safe sysctls are enabled by default. All unsafe sysctls are disabled by
default and must be allowed manually by the cluster administrator on a per-node
basis. Pods with disabled unsafe sysctls will be scheduled, but will fail to
launch.

[WARNING]
====
Due to their nature of being unsafe, the use of unsafe sysctls is
at-your-own-risk and can lead to severe problems like wrong behavior of
containers, resource shortage, or complete breakage of a node.
====

[[enabling-unsafe-sysctls]]
== Enabling Unsafe Sysctls

With the warning above in mind, the cluster administrator can allow certain
unsafe sysctls for very special situations, e.g., high-performance or real-time
application tuning.

If you want to use unsafe sysctls, cluster administrators must enable them
individually on nodes. Only namespaced sysctls can be enabled this way.

. Use the `*kubeletArguments*` field in the *_/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml_*
file, as described in
xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#configuring-node-resources[Configuring Node Resources], to set the desired unsafe sysctls:
+
----
kubeletArguments:
  experimental-allowed-unsafe-sysctls:
    - "kernel.msg*,net.ipv4.route.min_pmtu"
----

. Restart the node service to apply the changes:
+
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
# systemctl restart origin-node
----
endif::[]

[[setting-sysctls-for-a-pod]]
== Setting Sysctls for a Pod

Sysctls are set on pods using annotations. They apply to all containers in the
same pod.

Here is an example, with different annotations for safe and unsafe sysctls:

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: sysctl-example
  annotations:
    security.alpha.kubernetes.io/sysctls: kernel.shm_rmid_forced=1
    security.alpha.kubernetes.io/unsafe-sysctls: net.ipv4.route.min_pmtu=1000,kernel.msgmax=1 2 3
spec:
  ...
----

[NOTE]
====
A pod with the unsafe sysctls specified above will fail to launch on any node
that has not enabled those two unsafe sysctls explicitly. As with node-level
sysctls, use the
link:http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl/kubectl_taint[taints and
toleration feature] or
xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#updating-labels-on-nodes[labels on nodes]
to schedule those pods onto the right nodes.
