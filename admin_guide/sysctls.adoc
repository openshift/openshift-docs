== Overview

Sysctl settings are exposed via Kubernetes, allowing users to modify certain
kernel parameters at runtime for namespaces within a container. Only sysctls
that are namespaced can be set independently on pods. If a sysctl is not
namespaced, called _node-level_, it cannot be set within {product-title}.
Moreover, only those sysctls considered _safe_ are whitelisted by default; you
can manually enable other _unsafe_ sysctls on the node to be available to the
user.

[[undersatnding-sysctls]]
== Understanding sysctls

In Linux, the sysctl interface allows an administrator to modify kernel
parameters at runtime. Parameters are available via the *_/proc/sys/_* virtual
process file system. The parameters cover various subsystems, such as:

- kernel (common prefix: *_kernel._*)
- networking (common prefix: *_net._*)
- virtual memory (common prefix: *_vm._*)
- MDADM (common prefix: *_dev._*)

More subsystems are described in
link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/README[Kernel documentation]. To get a list of all parameters, you can run:

[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo sysctl -a
----

[[namespaced-vs-node-level-sysctls]]
== Namespaced versus node-level sysctls

A number of sysctls are _namespaced_ in today’s Linux kernels. This means that
you can set them independently for each pod on a node. Being namespaced is a
requirement for sysctls to be accessible in a pod context within Kubernetes.

The following sysctls are known to be namespaced:

- *_kernel.shm*_*
- *_kernel.msg*_*
- *_kernel.sem_*
- *_fs.mqueue.*_*

Additionally, most of the sysctls in the *_net.*_* group are known
to be namespaced. Their namespace adoption differs based on the kernel
version and distributor.

To check which *_net.*_* sysctls are namespaced on your system, run the
following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ podman run --rm -ti docker.io/fedora \
    /bin/sh -c "dnf install -y findutils && find /proc/sys/ \
    | grep -e /proc/sys/net"
----

Sysctls that are not namespaced are called _node-level_ and must be set
manually by the cluster administrator, either by means of the underlying Linux
distribution of the nodes, such as by modifying the *_/etc/sysctls.conf_* file,
or by using a DaemonSet with privileged containers.

[NOTE]
====
Consider marking nodes with special sysctls as tainted. Only schedule pods onto
them that need those sysctl settings. Use the
xref:../admin_guide/scheduling/taints_tolerations.adoc#admin-guide-taints[taints
and toleration feature] to mark the nodes.
====

[[safe-vs-unsafe-sysclts]]
== Safe versus unsafe sysctls

Sysctls are grouped into _safe_ and _unsafe_ sysctls. In addition to proper
namespacing, a safe sysctl must be properly isolated between pods on the same
node. This means that if you set a sysctl as safe for one pod it must not:

- Influence any other pod on the node
- Harm the node's health
- Gain CPU or memory resources outside of the resource limits of a pod

By far, most of the namespaced sysctls are not necessarily considered safe.

Currently, {product-title} supports, or whitelists, the following sysctls
in the safe set:

- *_kernel.shm_rmid_forced_*
- *_net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range_*
- *_net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies_*

This list might be extended in future versions when the kubelet supports better
isolation mechanisms.

All safe sysctls are enabled by default. All unsafe sysctls are disabled by
default, and the cluster administrator must manually enable them on a per-node
basis. Pods with disabled unsafe sysctls will be scheduled but will fail to
launch.

[[enabling-unsafe-sysctls]]
== Enabling unsafe sysctls

The cluster administrator can allow certain unsafe sysctls for very special
situations such as high-performance or real-time application tuning.

If you want to use unsafe sysctls, cluster administrators must enable them
individually on nodes. They can enable only namespaced sysctls.

[WARNING]
====
Due to their nature of being unsafe, the use of unsafe sysctls is
at-your-own-risk and can lead to severe problems like wrong behavior of
containers, resource shortage, or complete breakage of a node.
====

. Add the unsafe sysctls to the `kubeletArguments` parameter of the appropriate xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#modifying-nodes[node configuration map] file, as described in xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#configuring-node-resources[Configuring Node Resources]:
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit cm node-config-compute -n openshift-node

...
    kubeletArguments:
      allowed-unsafe-sysctls: <1>
      - "net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time"
      - "net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl"
      - "net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes"
----
<1> Add the unsafe sysctls you want to use.

. Create a new SCC that uses the contents of the *restricted* SCC and add the unsafe sysctls:
+
----
...
allowHostDirVolumePlugin: false
allowHostIPC: false
allowHostNetwork: false
allowHostPID: false
allowHostPorts: false
allowPrivilegeEscalation: true
allowPrivilegedContainer: false
allowedCapabilities: null
allowedUnsafeSysctls: <1>
- net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time
- net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl
- net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes
...
metadata:
  name: restricted-sysctls <2>
...
---- 
<1> Add the unsafe sysctls you want to use.
<2> Specify a new name for the SCC.

. Grant the new SCC access to your pod ServiceAccount:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user restricted-sysctls -z default -n your_project_name
----

. Add the unsafe sysctls to the DeploymentConfig for your pods.
+
----
kind: DeploymentConfig

  template:
    ...
    spec:
      containers:
      ...
      securityContext:

          value: "20"
        - name: net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes
          value: "3"
----

. Restart the node service to apply the changes:

# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node

[[setting-sysctls-for-a-pod]]
== Setting sysctls for a pod

Sysctls are set on pods using the pod's `securityContext`. The `securityContext`
applies to all containers in the same pod.

The following example uses the pod `securityContext` to set a safe sysctl
`kernel.shm_rmid_forced` and two unsafe sysctls, `net.ipv4.route.min_pmtu` and
`kernel.msgmax`. There is no distinction between _safe_ and _unsafe_ sysctls in
the specification.

[WARNING]
====
To avoid destabilizing your operating system, modify sysctl parameters only 
after you understand their effects.
====

Modify the YAML file that defines the pod and add the `securityContext` spec, as
shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: sysctl-example
spec:
  securityContext:
    sysctls:
    - name: kernel.shm_rmid_forced
      value: "0"
    - name: net.ipv4.route.min_pmtu
      value: "552"
    - name: kernel.msgmax
      value: "65536"
  ...
----

[NOTE]
====
A pod with the unsafe sysctls specified above will fail to launch on any node
that the admin has not explicitly enabled those two unsafe sysctls. As with
node-level sysctls, use the
xref:../admin_guide/scheduling/taints_tolerations.adoc#admin-guide-taints[taints and
toleration feature] or
xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#updating-labels-on-nodes[labels on nodes]
to schedule those pods onto the right nodes.
