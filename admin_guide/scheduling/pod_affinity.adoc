== Overview

_Pod affinity_ and _pod anti-affinity_ allow you to specify rules about how pods should be placed relative to other pods. The rules are defined using custom xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[labels on nodes] and label selectors specified in pods. Pod affinity/anti-affinity allows a *pod* to specify an affinity (or anti-affinity) towards a group of *pods* it can be placed with. The node does not have control over the placement.

For example, using affinity rules, you could spread or pack pods within a service or relative to pods in other services. Anti-affinity rules allow you to prevent pods of a particular service  from scheduling  on the same nodes as pods of another service that are known to interfere with the performance of the pods of the first service. Or, you could spread the pods of a service across nodes or availability zones to reduce correlated failures.

Pod affinity/anti-affinity allows you to constrain which nodes your pod is eligible to be scheduled on based on the labels on other pods. A xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[label] is a key/value pair.

* Pod affinity can tell the scheduler to locate a new pod on the same node as other pods if the label selector on the new pod matches the label on the current pod.
* Pod anti-affinity can prevent the scheduler from locating a new pod on the same node as pods with the same labels if the label selector on the new pod matches the label on the current pod.

There are two types of pod affinity rules: _required_ and _preferred_.

Required rules *must* be met before a pod can be scheduled on a node. Preferred rules specify that, if the rule is met, the scheduler tries to enforce the rules, but does not guarantee enforcement.

== Configuring Pod Affinity and Anti-affinity

You configure pod affinity/anti-affinity through the pod specification files. You can specify a xref:admin-guide-sched-affinity-config-pod-req[required rule], a xref:admin-guide-sched-affinity-config-pod-pref[preferred rule], or both. If you specify both, the node must first meet the required rule, then attempts to meet the preferred rule.

The following example shows a pod specification configured for pod affinity and anti-affinity.

In this example, the pod affinity rule indicates that the pod can schedule onto a node only if that node has at least one already-running pod with a label that has the key `security` and value `S1`. The pod anti-affinity rule says that the pod prefers to not schedule onto a node if that node is already running a pod with label having key `security` and value `S2`.

[NOTE]
====
If labels on a node change at runtime such that the affinity rules on a pod are no longer met, the pod continues to run on the node.

=== Configuring an Affinity Rule

The following steps demonstrate a simple two-pod configuration that creates pod with a label and a pod that uses affinity to allow scheduling with that pod.

. Create a pod with a specific label in the pod specification:
+
[source,yaml]
----
$ cat team4.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: security-s1
  labels:
    security: S1
spec:
  containers:
  - name: security-s1
    image: docker.io/ocpqe/hello-pod
----

. When creating other pods, edit the pod specification as follows:
+
.. Use the `podAffinity` stanza to configure the `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` parameter or `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` parameter:
+
.. Specify the key and value that must be met. If you want the new pod to be scheduled with the other pod, use the same `key` and `value` parameters as the label on the first pod.
+
[source,yaml]
----
    podAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: security
            operator: In
            values:
            - S1
        topologyKey: failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone
----
+
.. Specify an `operator`. The operator can be `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, or `DoesNotExist`. For example, use the operator `In` to require the label to be in the node.
+
.. Specify a `topologyKey`, which is a prepopulated link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#interlude-built-in-node-labels[Kubernetes label] that the system uses to denote such a topology domain.

. Create the pod.

=== Configuring an Anti-affinity Rule

The following steps demonstrate a simple two-pod configuration that creates pod with a label and a pod that uses an anti-affinity preferred rule to attempt to prevent scheduling with that pod.

. Create a pod with a specific label in the pod specification:
+
[source,yaml]
----
$ cat team4.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: security-s2
  labels:
    security: S2
spec:
  containers:
  - name: security-s2
    image: docker.io/ocpqe/hello-pod
----

. When creating other pods, edit the pod specification to set the following parameters:

. Use the `podAffinity` stanza to configure the `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` parameter or `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` parameter:
+
.. Specify a weight for the node, 1-100. The node that with highest weight is preferred.
+
.. Specify the key and values that must be met. If you want the new pod to not be scheduled with the other pod, use the same `key` and `value` parameters as the label on the first pod.
+
[source,yaml]
----
    podAntiAffinity:
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 100
        podAffinityTerm:
          labelSelector:
            matchExpressions:
            - key: security
              operator: In
              values:
              - S2
          topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
----
+
.. For a preferred rule, specify a weight, 1-100.
+
.. Specify an `operator`. The operator can be `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, or `DoesNotExist`. For example, use the operator `In` to require the label to be in the node.

. Specify a `topologyKey`, which is a prepopulated link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#interlude-built-in-node-labels[Kubernetes label] that the system uses to denote such a topology domain.

. Create the pod.

== Examples

The following examples demonstrate pod affinity and pod anti-affinity.

[[admin-guide-sched-affinity-examples1-pods]]
=== Pod Affinity

The following example demonstrates pod affinity for pods with matching labels and label selectors.

* The pod *team4* has the label `team:4`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
$ cat team4.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: team4
  labels:
     team: "4"
spec:
  containers:
  - name: ocp
    image: docker.io/ocpqe/hello-pod
----

* The pod *team4a* has the label selector `team:4` under `podAffinity`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
$ cat pod-team4a.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: team4a
spec:
  affinity:
    podAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: team
            operator: In
            values:
            - "4"
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
  containers:
  - name: pod-affinity
    image: docker.io/ocpqe/hello-pod
----

* The *team4a* pod is scheduled on the same node as the *team4* pod.


[[admin-guide-sched-affinity-examples2-pods]]
=== Pod Anti-affinity

The following example demonstrates pod anti-affinity for pods with matching labels and label selectors.

* The pod *pod-s1* has the label `security:s1`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
cat pod-s1.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: s1
  labels:
    security: s1
spec:
  containers:
  - name: ocp
    image: docker.io/ocpqe/hello-pod
----

* The pod *pod-s2* has the label selector `security:s1` under `podAntiAffinity`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
cat pod-s2.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-s2
spec:
  affinity:
    podAntiAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: security
            operator: In
            values:

        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
  containers:
  - name: pod-antiaffinity
    image: docker.io/ocpqe/hello-pod
----

* The pod *pod-s2* is not scheduled unless there is a node with a pod that has the `security:s2` label. If there is no other pod with that label, the new pod remains in a pending state:
+
----
NAME      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP        NODE
pod-s2    0/1       Pending   0          32s       <none>
----

[[admin-guide-sched-affinity-examples3-pods]]
=== Pod Affinity with no Matching Labels

The following example demonstrates pod affinity for pods without matching labels and label selectors.


* The pod *pod-s1* has the label `security:s1`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
$ cat pod-s1.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod

          matchExpressions:
          - key: security
            operator: In
            values:
            - s2
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
  containers:
  - name: pod-affinity
    image: docker.io/ocpqe/hello-pod
----

* The pod *pod-s2* cannot be scheduled on the same node as `pod-s1`.
