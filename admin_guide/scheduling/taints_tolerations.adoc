== Overview

Taints and tolerations allow the *node* to control which *pods* should (or should not) be scheduled on them.

== Taints and Tolerations

A _taint_ allows a node to refuse pod to be scheduled unless that pod has a matching _toleration_.

You apply taints to a node through the node specification (`NodeSpec`) and apply tolerations to a pod through the pod specification (`PodSpec`). A taint on a node instructs the node to repel all pods that do not tolerate the taint.

Taints and tolerations consist of a key, value, and effect. An operator allows you to leave one of these parameters empty.

[[taint-components-table]]
.Taint and toleration components
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Parameter |Description

|`key`
|The `key` is any string, up to 253 characters. The key must begin with a letter or number, and may contain letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, and underscores.

|`value`
| The `value` is any string, up to 63 characters. The value must begin with a letter or number, and may contain letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, and underscores.

|`effect`

|The effect is one of the following:
[frame=none]
[cols="2a,3a"]
!====
!`NoSchedule`
!* New pods that do not match the taint are not scheduled onto that node.
* Existing pods on the node remain.
!`PreferNoSchedule`
!* New pods that do not match the taint might be scheduled onto that node, but the scheduler tries not to.
* Existing pods on the node remain.
!`NoExecute`
!* New pods that do not match the taint cannot be scheduled onto that node.
* Existing pods on the node that do not have a matching toleration  are removed.
!====

|`operator`
|[frame=none]
[cols="2,3"]
!====
!`Equal`
!The `key`/`value`/`effect` parameters must match. This is the default.
!`Exists`
!The `key`/`effect` parameters must match. You must leave a blank `value` parameter, which matches any.
!====

|===

A toleration matches a taint:

* If the `operator` parameter is set to `Equal`:
** the `key` parameters are the same;
** the `value` parameters are the same;
** the `effect` parameters are the same.

* If the `operator` parameter is set to `Exists`:
** the `key` parameters are the same;
** the `effect` parameters are the same.

===== Using Multiple Taints

You can put multiple taints on the same node and multiple tolerations on the same pod. {product-title} processes multiple taints and tolerations as follows:

. Process the taints for which the pod has a matching toleration.
. The remaining unmatched taints have the indicated effects on the pod:
+
* If there is at least one unmatched taint with effect `NoSchedule`, {product-title} cannot schedule a pod onto that node.
* If there is no unmatched taint with effect `NoSchedule` but there is at least one unmatched taint with effect `PreferNoSchedule`, {product-title} tries to not schedule the pod onto the node.
* If there is at least one unmatched taint with effect `NoExecute`, {product-title} evicts the pod from the node (if it is already running on the node), or the pod is not scheduled onto the node (if it is not yet running on the node).
+
** Pods that do not tolerate the taint are evicted immediately.
+
** Pods that tolerate the taint without specifying `tolerationSeconds` in their toleration specification remain bound forever.
+
** Pods that tolerate the taint with a specified `tolerationSeconds` remain bound for the specified amount of time.

For example:

* The node has the following taints:
+
----
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoExecute
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 key2=value2:NoSchedule
----

* The pod has the following tolerations:
+
[source, yaml]
----
tolerations:
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value1"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value1"
  effect: "NoExecute"
----

In this case, the pod cannot be scheduled onto the node, because there is no toleration matching the third taint. The pod continues running if it is already running on the node when the taint is added, because the third taint is the only
one of the three that is not tolerated by the pod.


[[admin-guide-taints-add]]
== Adding a Taint to an Existing Node

You add a taint to a node using the `oc adm taint` command with the parameters described in the xref:taint-components-table[Taint and toleration components] table:

----
$ oc adm taint nodes <node-name> <key>=<value>:<effect>
----

For example:

----
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule
----

The example places a taint on `node1` that has key `key1`, value `value1`, and taint effect `NoSchedule`.

[[admin-guide-taints-add-pod]]
== Adding a Toleration to a Pod

To add a toleration to a pod, edit the pod specification to include a `tolerations` section:

.Sample pod configuration file with `Equal` operator
[source, yaml]
----
tolerations:
- key: "key1" <1>
  operator: "Equal" <1>
  value: "value1" <1>
  effect: "NoExecute" <1>
  tolerationSeconds: 3600 <2>
----

<1> The toleration parameters, as described in the xref:taint-components-table[Taint and toleration components] table.
<2> The `tolerationSeconds` parameter specifies how long a pod can remain bound to a node before being evicted. See xref:tolerationSeconds[Using Toleration Seconds to Delay Pod Evictions] below.


.Sample pod configuration file with `Exists` operator
[source, yaml]
----
tolerations:
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: "NoExecute"
  tolerationSeconds: 3600
----

Both of these tolerations match the xref:admin-guide-taints-add[taint created by the `oc adm taint` command above]. A pod with either toleration would be able to schedule onto `node1`.

[[admin-guide-taints-tolerationSeconds]]
=== Using Toleration Seconds to Delay Pod Evictions

You can specify how long a pod can remain bound to a node before being evicted by specifying the `tolerationSeconds` parameter in the pod specification. If a taint with the `NoExecute` effect is added to a node, any pods that do not tolerate the taint are evicted immediately (pods that do tolerate the taint are not evicted). However, if a pod that to be evicted has the `tolerationSeconds` parameter, the pod is not evicted until that time period expires.

For example:
[source, yaml]
----
tolerations:
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value1"
  effect: "NoExecute"
  tolerationSeconds: 3600
----

Here, if this pod is running but does not have a matching taint, the pod stays bound to the node for 3,600 seconds and then be evicted. If the taint is removed before that time, the pod is not evicted.

[[admin-guide-taints-tolsec-default]]
==== Setting a Default Value for Toleration Seconds

This plug-in sets the default forgiveness toleration for pods, to tolerate the `node.alpha.kubernetes.io/notReady:NoExecute` and `node.alpha.kubernetes.io/notReady:NoExecute` taints for five minutes.

If the pod configuration provided by the user already has either toleration, the default is not added.

To enable Default Toleration Seconds:

. Modify the master configuration file (*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*) to Add `DefaultTolerationSeconds` to the admissionConfig section:
+
[source, yaml]
----
admissionConfig:
  pluginConfig:
    DefaultTolerationSeconds:
      configuration:
        kind: DefaultAdmissionConfig
        apiVersion: v1
        disable: false
----

. Restart OpenShift for the changes to take effect:
+
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api atomic-openshift-master-controllers
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
# systemctl restart origin-master-api origin-master-controllers
----
endif::[]

. Verify that the default was added:
+
.. Create a pod:
+
----
$ oc create -f </path/to/file>
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ oc create -f hello-pod.yaml
pod "hello-pod" created
----
+
.. Check the pod tolerations:
+
----
$ oc describe pod <pod-name> |grep -i toleration
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ oc describe pod hello-pod |grep -i toleration
Tolerations:    node.alpha.kubernetes.io/notReady=:Exists:NoExecute for 300s
----



[[admin-guide-taints-pod-eviction]]
== Preventing Pod Eviction for Node Problems

{product-title} can be configured to represent *node unreachable* and *node not ready* conditions as taints.  This allows per-pod specification of how long to remain bound to a node that becomes unreachable or not ready, rather than using the default of five minutes.

When the Taint Based Evictions feature is enabled, the taints are automatically added by the node controller and the normal logic for evicting pods from `Ready` nodes is disabled.

* If a node enters a not ready state, the `node.alpha.kubernetes.io/notReady:NoExecute`  taint is added and pods cannot be scheduled on the node. Existing pods remain for the toleration seconds period.
* If a node enters a not reachable state, the `node.alpha.kubernetes.io/unreachable:NoExecute` taint is added and pods cannot be scheduled on the node. Existing pods remain for the toleration seconds period.

To enable Taint Based Evictions:

. Modify the master configuration file (*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*) to add the following to the `kubernetesMasterConfig` section:
+
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
   controllerArguments:
        feature-gates:
        - "TaintBasedEvictions=true"
----

. Check that the taint is added to a node:
+
----
oc describe node $node | grep -i taint

Taints: node.alpha.kubernetes.io/notReady:NoExecute
----

. Restart OpenShift for the changes to take effect:
+
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api atomic-openshift-master-controllers
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
# systemctl restart origin-master-api origin-master-controllers
----
endif::[]

. Add a toleration to pods:
+
[source, yaml]
----
tolerations:
- key: "node.alpha.kubernetes.io/unreachable"
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: "NoExecute"
  tolerationSeconds: 6000
----
+
or
+
[source, yaml]
----
tolerations:
- key: "node.alpha.kubernetes.io/notReady"
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: "NoExecute"
  tolerationSeconds: 6000
----

[NOTE]
====
To maintain the existing link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/node/#node-controller[rate limiting] behavior of pod evictions due to node problems, the system adds the taints in a rate-limited way. This prevents massive pod evictions in scenarios such as the master becoming partitioned from the nodes.
====


[[admin-guide-taints-daemonsets]]
== Daemonsets and Tolerations

link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/daemons/[DaemonSet] pods are created with `NoExecute` tolerations for `node.alpha.kubernetes.io/unreachable` and `node.alpha.kubernetes.io/notReady`
with no `tolerationSeconds` to ensure that DaemonSet pods are never evicted due to these problems, even when the Default Toleration Seconds feature is disabled.

[[admin-guide-taints-use-cases]]
== Examples

Taints and tolerations are a flexible way to steer pods away from nodes or evict pods that should not be running on a node. A few of typical scenrios are:

* xref:admin-guide-taints-dedicated-user[Dedicating a node for a user]
* xref:admin-guide-taints-dedicated-only[Binding a user to a node]
* xref:admin-guide-taints-special[Dedicating nodes with special hardware]


[[admin-guide-taints-dedicated-user]]
=== Dedicating a Node for a User

You can specify a set of nodes for exclusive use by a particular set of users.

To specify dedicated nodes:

. Add a taint to those nodes:
+
For example:
+
----
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 dedicated=groupName:NoSchedule
----

. Add a corresponding toleration to the pods by writing a custom xref:../../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-config-admission-control-config[admission controller].
+
Only the pods with the tolerations are allowed to use the dedicated nodes.

[[admin-guide-taints-dedicated-only]]
=== Binding a User to a Node

You can configure a node so that particular users can use only the dedicated nodes.

To configure a node so that users can use only that node:

. Add a taint to those nodes:
+
For example:
+
----
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 dedicated=groupName:NoSchedule
----

. Add a corresponding toleration to the pods by writing a custom xref:../../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-config-admission-control-config[admission controller].
+
The admission controller should add a node affinity to require that the pods can only schedule onto nodes labeled with the `key:value` label (`dedicated=groupName`).

. Add a label similar to the taint (such as the `key:value` label) to the dedicated nodes.


[[admin-guide-taints-special]]
=== Nodes with Special Hardware

In a cluster where a small subset of nodes have specialized hardware (for example GPUs), you can use taints and tolerations to keep pods that do not need the specialized hardware off of those nodes, leaving the nodes for pods that do need the specialized hardware. You can also require pods that need specialized hardware to use specific nodes.

To ensure pods are blocked from the specialized hardware:

. Taint the nodes that have the specialized hardware using one of the following commands:
+
----
$ oc adm taint nodes <node-name> disktype=ssd:NoSchedule
$ oc adm taint nodes <node-name> disktype=ssd:PreferNoSchedule
----

. Adding a corresponding toleration to pods that use the special hardware using an xref:../../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-config-admission-control-config[admission controller].

For example, the admission controller could use some characteristic(s) of the pod to determine that the pod should be allowed to use the special nodes by adding a toleration.

To ensure pods can only use the specialized hardware, you need some additional mechanism. For example, you could label the nodes that have the special hardware and use node affinity on the pods that need the hardware.
