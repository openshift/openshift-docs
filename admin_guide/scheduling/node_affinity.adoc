== Overview

_Node affinity_ is a set of rules used by the scheduler to determine where a pod can be placed. The rules are defined using custom xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[labels on nodes] and label selectors specified in pods. Node affinity allows a *pod* to specify an affinity (or anti-affinity) towards a group of *nodes* it can be placed on. The node does not have control over the placement.

For example, you could configure a pod to only run on a node with a specific CPU or in a specific availability zone.

There are two types of node affinity rules: _required_ and _preferred_.

Required rules *must* be met before a pod can be scheduled on a node. Preferred rules specify that, if the rule is met, the scheduler tries to enforce the rules, but does not guarantee enforcement.

[NOTE]
====
If labels on a node change at runtime that results in an node affinity rule on a pod no longer being met, the pod continues to run on the node.

== Configuring Node Affinity

You configure node affinity through the pod specification file. You can specify a xref:admin-guide-sched-affinity-config-req[required rule], a xref:admin-guide-sched-affinity-config-pref[preferred rule], or both. If you specify both, the node must first meet the required rule, then attempts to meet the preferred rule.

The following example is a pod specification with a rule that requires the pod be placed on a node with a label whose key is `e2e-az-NorthSouth` and whose value is either `e2e-az-North` or `e2e-az-South`:

            values:
            - e2e-az-North <3>

<4> The operator represents the relationship between the label on the node and the set of values in the `matchExpression` parameters in the pod specification. This value can be `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, or `DoesNotExist`, `Lt`, or `Gt`.

The following example is a node specification with a preferred rule that a node with a label whose key is `e2e-az-EastWest` and whose value is either `e2e-az-East` or `e2e-az-West` is preferred for the pod:

<1> The stanza to configure node affinity.
<2> Defines a preferred rule.
<3> Specifies a weight for a preferred rule. The node with highest weight is preferred.
<4> The key/value pair (label) that must be matched to apply the rule.
<5> The operator represents the relationship between the label on the node and
the set of values in the `matchExpression` parameters in the pod specification.
This value can be `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, or `DoesNotExist`, `Lt`, or `Gt`.

There is no explicit _node anti-affinity_ concept, but using the `NotIn` or `DoesNotExist` operator replicates that behavior.

[[admin-guide-sched-affinity-selectors]]
[NOTE]
====
If you are using node affinity and xref:../../admin_guide/scheduling/node_selector#admin-guide-sched-selector[node selectors] in the same pod configuration, note the following:

//tag::affinity-and-selectors[]

* If you configure both `nodeSelector` and `nodeAffinity`, both conditions must be satisfied for the pod to be scheduled onto a candidate node.

* If you specify multiple `nodeSelectorTerms` associated with `nodeAffinity` types, then the pod can be scheduled onto a node if one of the `nodeSelectorTerms` is satisfied.

* If you specify multiple `matchExpressions` associated with `nodeSelectorTerms`, then the pod can be scheduled onto a node only if all `matchExpressions` are satisfied.

=== Configuring a Required Node Affinity Rule

Required rules *must* be met before a pod can be scheduled on a node. 

The following steps demonstrate a simple configuration that creates a node and a pod that the scheduler is required to place on the node.

. Add a label to a node by editing the node configuration or by using the `oc label node` command:
+
----
$ oc label node node1 e2e-az-name=e2e-az1
----

. In the pod specification, use the `nodeAffinity` stanza to configure the `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` parameter:
+
.. Specify the key and values that must be met. If you want the new pod to be scheduled on the node you edited, use the same `key` and `value` parameters as the label in the node.
+
.. Specify an `operator`. The operator can be `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, `DoesNotExist`, `Lt`, or `Gt`. For example, use the operator `In` to require the label to be in the node:
+
----
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: e2e-az-name
            operator: In
            values:
            - e2e-az1
            - e2e-az2
----

. Create the pod:
+
----
$ oc create -f e2e-az2.yaml
----

[[admin-guide-sched-affinity-config-pref]]
=== Configuring a Preferred Node Affinity Rule

Preferred rules specify that, if the rule is met, the scheduler tries to enforce the rules, but does not guarantee enforcement.

The following steps demonstrate a simple configuration that creates a node and a pod that the scheduler tries to place on the node.

. Add a label to a node by editing the node configuration or by executing the `oc label node` command:
+
----
$ oc label node node1 e2e-az-name=e2e-az3
----

. In the pod specification, use the `nodeAffinity` stanza to configure the `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` parameter:
+
.. Specify a weight for the node, as a number 1-100. The node with highest weight is preferred.
+
.. Specify the key and values that must be met. If you want the new pod to be scheduled on the node you edited, use the same `key` and `value` parameters as the label in the node:
+
----
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 1
        preference:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: e2e-az-name
            operator: In
            values:
            - e2e-az3
----

. Specify an `operator`. The operator can be `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, `DoesNotExist`, `Lt`, or `Gt`. For example, use the operator `In` to require the label to be in the node.

. Create the pod.
+

$ oc create -f e2e-az3.yaml

== Examples

The following examples demonstrate node affinity.

[[admin-guide-sched-affinity-examples1]]
=== Node Affinity with Matching Labels

The following example demonstrates node affinity for a node and pod with matching labels:

* The *Node1* node has the label `zone:us`:
+
----
$ oc label node node1 zone=us
----

*  The pod *pod-s1* has the `zone` and `us` key/value pair under a required node affinity rule:
+
----
$ cat pod-s1.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-s1
spec:
  containers:
    - image: "docker.io/ocpqe/hello-pod"

              operator: In
              values:

----

* Create the pod using the standard command:
+
----
$ oc create -f pod-s1.yaml
pod "pod-s1" created
----

* The pod *pod-s1* can be scheduled on *Node1*:
