== Overview

A _node selector_ specifies a map of key-value pairs. The rules are defined using custom xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[labels on nodes] and selectors specified in pods.

For the pod to be eligible to run on a node, the pod must have the indicated key-value pairs as the label on the node. 

If you are using node affinity and xref:../../admin_guide/scheduling/node_selector.adoc#admin-guide-sched-selector[node selectors] in the same pod configuration, see the xref:admin-guide-sched-selector-affinity-2[important considerations] below.
