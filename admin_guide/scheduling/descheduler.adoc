== Overview

Descheduling involves evicting pods based on xref:admin-guide-descheduler-policies[specific policies] so that the pods can be rescheduled
onto more appropriate nodes.

Your cluster can benefit from descheduling and rescheduling already-running pods for various reasons:

* Nodes are under- or over-utilized.
* Pod and node affinity requirements, such as taints or labels, have changed and the original scheduling decisions are no longer appropriate for certain nodes.
* Node failure requires pods to be moved.
* New nodes are added to clusters.

The descheduler does not schedule replacement of evicted pods. The xref:../../admin_guide/scheduling/scheduler.adoc#admin-guide-scheduler[scheduler]
automatically performs this task for the evicted pods.

It is important to note that there are a number of core components, such as DNS, that are critical to a fully functional cluster,
but, run on a regular cluster node rather than the master. A cluster may stop working properly if the component is evicted. To prevent the
descheduler from removing these pods, configure the pod as a xref:../../admin_guide/managing_pods.adoc#admin-manage-pod-critical[critical pod]
by adding the `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/critical-pod` annotation to the pod specification.

[NOTE]
====
The descheduler job is considered a critical pod, which prevents the descheduler pod from being evicted by the descheduler.
====

The descheduler job and descheduler pod are created in the `kube-system` project, which is created by default.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The descheduler is a Technology Preview feature only.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to
upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide
feedback during the development process.

For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features support scope, see
https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.
endif::[]
====

The descheduler does not evict the following types of pods:

* Critical pods (with the `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/critical-pod` annotation).
* Pods (link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/static-pod/[static and mirror pods] or pods in standalone mode) not associated with a Replica Set, Replication Controller, Deployment, or Job (because these pods are not recreated).
* Pods associated with xref:../../dev_guide/daemonsets.adoc#dev-guide-daemonsets[DaemonSets].
* Pods with local storage.
* Pods subject to xref:../../admin_guide/managing_pods.adoc#managing-pods-poddisruptionbudget[Pod Disruption Budget (PDB)]
are not evicted if descheduling violates the PDB. The pods can be evicted using
an xref:../../admin_guide/out_of_resource_handling.adoc#out-of-resource-eviction-policy[eviction policy].

[NOTE]
====
Best efforts pods are evicted before Burstable and Guaranteed pods.

The following sections describe the process to configure and run the descheduler:

. xref:admin-guide-descheduler-role[Create a role].
. Define the descheduling behavior in a xref:admin-guide-descheduler-policies[policy file].
. Create a xref:admin-guide-descheduler-policy[configuration map to reference the policy file].
. Create the xref:admin-guide-descheduler-job[descheduler job configuration].
. xref:admin-guide-descheduler-run[Run the descheduler job].

[[admin-guide-descheduler-role]]
== Creating a Cluster Role

To configure the necessary permissions for the descheduler to work in a pod:

. Create a xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[cluster role] with the following rules:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: descheduler-cluster-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["nodes"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"] <1>
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list", "delete"] <2>
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods/eviction"] <3>
  verbs: ["create"]
----
<1> Configures the role to allow viewing nodes.
<2> Configures the role to allow viewing and deleting pods.
<3> Allows a node to evict pods bound to itself.

. Create the xref:../../admin_guide/service_accounts.adoc#admin-guide-service-accounts[service account] which will be used to run the job:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# oc create sa <file-name>.yaml -n kube-system
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# oc create sa descheduler-sa.yaml -n kube-system
----

. Bind the cluster role to the service account:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# oc create clusterrolebinding descheduler-cluster-role-binding \
    --clusterrole=<cluster-role-name> \
    --serviceaccount=kube-system:<service-account-name>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# oc create clusterrolebinding descheduler-cluster-role-binding \
    --clusterrole=descheduler-cluster-role \
    --serviceaccount=kube-system:descheduler-sa

[[admin-guide-descheduler-policies]]
== Creating Descheduler Policies

You can configure the descheduler to remove pods from nodes that violate rules defined by _strategies_ in a YAML policy file. You then create a xref:admin-guide-descheduler-policy[configuration map] that includes a path to the policy file and a xref:admin-guide-descheduler-job[job specification] using that configuration map to apply the specific descheduling strategy.

.Sample descheduler policy file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "descheduler/v1alpha1"
kind: "DeschedulerPolicy"
strategies:
  "RemoveDuplicates":
     enabled: false
  "LowNodeUtilization":
     enabled: true
     params:
       nodeResourceUtilizationThresholds:
         thresholds:
           "cpu" : 20
           "memory": 20
           "pods": 20
         targetThresholds:
           "cpu" : 50
           "memory": 50
           "pods": 50
         numberOfNodes: 3
  "RemovePodsViolatingInterPodAntiAffinity":
     enabled: true
  "RemovePodsViolatingNodeAffinity":
    enabled: true
    params:
      nodeAffinityType:
      - "requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution"
----

There are three default strategies that can be used with the descheduler:

* xref:admin-guide-descheduler-policies-remove[Remove duplicate pods (`RemoveDuplicates`)]
* xref:admin-guide-descheduler-policies-low[Move pods to underutilized nodes (`LowNodeUtilization`)]
* xref:admin-guide-descheduler-policies-anti[Remove pods that violate anti-affinity rules (`RemovePodsViolatingInterPodAntiAffinity`)]
* xref:admin-guide-descheduler-policies-node[Remove Pods Violating Node Affinity (RemovePodsViolatingNodeAffinity)]

You can configure and disable parameters associated with strategies as needed.

[[admin-guide-descheduler-policies-remove]]
=== Removing Duplicate Pods

The `RemoveDuplicates` strategy ensures that there is only one pod associated with
a xref:../../dev_guide/deployments/kubernetes_deployments.adoc#dev-guide-kubernetes-deployments-support[Replica Set],
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#replication-controllers[Replication Controller],
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[Deployment Configuration], or
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#jobs[Job] running on same node.
If there are other pods associated with those objects, the duplicate pods are evicted. Removing duplicate pods results in better spreading of pods in a cluster.

For example, duplicate pods could happen if a node fails and the pods on the node are moved to another node, leading to more than one pod associated with an Replica Set or Replication Controller, running on same node. After the failed node is ready again, this strategy could be used to evict those duplicate pods.

There are no parameters associated with this strategy.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "descheduler/v1alpha1"
kind: "DeschedulerPolicy"
strategies:
  "RemoveDuplicates":
     enabled: false <1>
----
<1> Set this value to `enabled: true` to use this policy. Set to `false` to disable this policy.

[[admin-guide-descheduler-policies-low]]
=== Creating a Low Node Utilization Policy

The `LowNodeUtilization` strategy finds nodes that are underutilized and evicts pods from other nodes so that the evicted pods can be scheduled on these underutilized nodes.

The underutilization of nodes is determined by a configurable threshold, `thresholds`, for CPU, memory, or number of pods (based on percentage). If a node usage is below all these thresholds, the node is considered underutilized and the descheduler can evict pods from other nodes. Pods request resource requirements are considered when computing node resource utilization.

A high threshold value, `targetThresholds` is used to determine properly utilized nodes. Any node that is between the _thresholds_ and _targetThresholds_ is considered properly utilized and is not considered for eviction. The threshold, `targetThresholds`, can be configured for CPU, memory, and number of pods (based on percentage).

These thresholds could be tuned for your cluster requirements.

The `numberOfNodes` parameter can be configured to activate the strategy only when number of underutilized nodes is above the configured value. Set this parameter if it is acceptable for a few nodes to go underutilized. By default, `numberOfNodes` is set to zero.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "descheduler/v1alpha1"
kind: "DeschedulerPolicy"
strategies:
  "LowNodeUtilization":
     enabled: true
     params:
       nodeResourceUtilizationThresholds:
         thresholds: <1>
           "cpu" : 20
           "memory": 20
           "pods": 20
         targetThresholds: <2>
           "cpu" : 50
           "memory": 50
           "pods": 50
         numberOfNodes: 3 <3>
----
<1> Set the low-end threshold. If the node is below all three values, the descheduler considers the node underutilized.
<2> Set the high-end threshold. If the node is below these values and above the `threshold` values, the descheduler considers the node  properly utilized.
<3> Set the number of nodes that can be underutilized before the descheduler will evict pods from underutilized nodes.

[[admin-guide-descheduler-policies-anti]]
=== Remove Pods Violating Inter-Pod Anti-Affinity

The `RemovePodsViolatingInterPodAntiAffinity` strategy ensures that pods violating inter-pod anti-affinity are removed from nodes.

For example, *Node1* has *podA*, *podB*, and *podC*. *podB* and *podC* have anti-affinity rules that prohibit them from running on the same node as *podA*. *podA* will be evicted from the node so that *podB* and *podC* can run on that node. This situation could happen if the anti-affinity rule was applied when *podB* and *podC* were running on the node.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "descheduler/v1alpha1"
kind: "DeschedulerPolicy"
strategies:
  "RemovePodsViolatingInterPodAntiAffinity": <1>
     enabled: true
----

<1> Set this value to `enabled: true` to use this policy. Set to `false` to disable this policy.

[[admin-guide-descheduler-policies-node]]
=== Remove Pods Violating Node Affinity

The `RemovePodsViolatingNodeAffinity` strategy ensures that all pods violating node affinity are removed from nodes. This situation could occur if a node no longer satisfies a pod’s affinity rule. If another node is available that satisfies the affinity rule, the pod is evicted.

For example, *podA* is scheduled on *nodeA*, because the node satisfies the `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` node affinity rule at the time of scheduling.If *nodeA* stops satisfying the rule, and if there is another node available that satisfies the node affinity rule, the strategy evicts *podA* from *nodeA* and moves it to the other node.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "descheduler/v1alpha1"
kind: "DeschedulerPolicy"
strategies:
  "RemovePodsViolatingNodeAffinity": <1>
    enabled: true
    params:
      nodeAffinityType:
      - "requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution" <2>
----

<1> Set this value to `enabled: true` to use this policy. Set to `false` to disable this policy.
<2> Specify the `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` node affinity type.

[[admin-guide-descheduler-policy]]
== Create a Configuration Map for the Descheduler Policy

Create a xref:../../dev_guide/configmaps.adoc#dev-guide-configmaps[configuration map] for the descheduler policy file in the `kube-system` project, so that it can be referenced by the descheduler job.

[source,terminal]
----
# oc create configmap descheduler-policy-configmap \
     -n kube-system --from-file=<path-to-policy-dir/policy.yaml> <1>
----
<1> The path to the policy file you created.

[[admin-guide-descheduler-job]]
== Create the Job Specification

Create a xref:../../dev_guide/jobs.adoc#creating-a-job[job configuration] for the descheduler.
