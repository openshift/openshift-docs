== Overview

Pod scheduling is an internal process that determines placement of new
pods onto nodes within the cluster.

The scheduler code has a clean separation that watches new pods
as they get created and identifies the most suitable node to host them. It then
creates bindings (pod to node bindings) for the pods using the master API.

[[admin-guide-scheduling-index-default]]
== Default scheduling

{product-title} comes with a default scheduler that serves the needs of most users. The default scheduler uses both inherent and customizable tools to determine the best fit for a pod. 

For information on how the default scheduler determines pod placement and available customizable parameters, see xref:../../admin_guide/scheduling/scheduler.adoc#admin-guide-scheduler[Default Scheduling].

[[admin-guide-scheduling-index-advanced]]
== Advanced scheduling

In situations where you might want more control over where new pods are placed, the {product-title} advanced scheduling features allow you to configure a pod so that the pod is required to (or has a preference to) run on a particular node or alongside a specific pod. Advanced scheduling also allows you to prevent pods from being placed on a node or with another pod.  

For information about advanced scheduling, see xref:../../admin_guide/scheduling/scheduler-advanced.adoc#admin-guide-scheduling-advanced[Advanced Scheduling].

[[admin-guide-scheduling-index-custom]]
== Custom scheduling

{product-title} also allows you to use your own or third-party schedulers by editing the pod specification. 

For more information, see xref:../../admin_guide/scheduling/custom_scheduler.adoc#admin-guide-sched-custom[Custom Schedulers].
