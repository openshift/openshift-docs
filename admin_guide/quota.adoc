== Overview

A resource quota, defined by a `*ResourceQuota*` object, provides constraints
that limit aggregate resource consumption per project. It can limit the quantity
of objects that can be created in a project by type, as well as the total amount
of compute resources that may be consumed by resources in that project.

[[resources-managed-by-quota]]
== Resources Managed by Quota

The following describes the set of resources that may be managed by a resource
quota.

[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Resource Name |Description

|`*cpu*`
|Across all pods in a non-terminal state, the sum of CPU requests cannot exceed
this value.

|`*memory*`
|Across all pods in a non-terminal state, the sum of memory requests cannot
exceed this value.

|`*requests.cpu*`
|Across all pods in a non-terminal state, the sum of CPU requests cannot exceed
this value.

|`*requests.memory*`
|Across all pods in a non-terminal state, the sum of memory requests cannot
exceed this value.

|`*limits.cpu*`
|Across all pods in a non-terminal state, the sum of CPU limits cannot exceed
this value.

|`*limits.memory*`
|Across all pods in a non-terminal state, the sum of memory limits cannot exceed
this value.

|`*configmaps*`
|The total number of `*ConfigMap*` objects that can exist in the project.

|`*pods*`
|The total number of pods in a non-terminal state that can exist in the project.
A pod is in a terminal state if `status.phase in (Failed, Succeeded)` is true.

|`*replicationcontrollers*`
|The total number of replication controllers that can exist in the project.

|`*resourcequotas*`
|The total number of resource quotas that can exist in the project.

|`*services*`
|The total number of services that can exist in the project.

|`*secrets*`
|The total number of secrets that can exist in the project.

|`*persistentvolumeclaims*`
|The total number of persistent volume claims that can exist in the project.

[[quota-scopes]]
== Quota Scopes

Each quota can have an associated set of _scopes_. A quota will only
measure usage for a resource if it matches the intersection of enumerated
scopes.

Adding a scope to a quota limits the number of resources it supports to those
that pertain to the scope. Specifying a resource on the quota outside of the
allowed set would result in a validation error.

[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Scope |Description

|*Terminating*
|Match pods where `spec.activeDeadlineSeconds >= 0`

|*NotTerminating*
|Match pods where `spec.activeDeadlineSeconds is nil`

|*BestEffort*
|Match pods that have best effort quality of service for either `*cpu*` or
`*memory*`.

|*NotBestEffort*
|Match pods that do not have best effort quality of service for `*cpu*` and
`*memory*`.
|===

A *BestEffort* scope restricts a quota to limit the following resources:

- `*pods*`

A *Terminating*, *NotTerminating*, and *NotBestEffort* scope restricts a quota
to tracking the following resources:

- `*pods*`
- `*memory*`
- `*requests.memory*`
- `*limits.memory*`
- `*cpu*`
- `*requests.cpu*`
- `*limits.cpu*`

[[quota-enforcement]]
== Quota Enforcement

After a resource quota for a project is first created, the project restricts the
ability to create any new resources that may violate a quota constraint until it
has calculated updated usage statistics.

After a quota is created and usage statistics are updated, the project accepts
the creation of new content. When you create or modify resources, your quota
usage is incremented immediately upon the request to create or modify the
resource.

When you delete a resource, your quota use is decremented during the next full
recalculation of quota statistics for the project. When you delete resources, a
link:#configuring-quota-sync-period[configurable amount of time] determines how
long it takes to reduce quota usage statistics to their current observed system
value.

If project modifications exceed a quota usage limit, the server denies the
action, and an appropriate error message is returned to the user explaining the
quota constraint violated, and what their currently observed usage stats are in
the system.

[[requests-vs-limits]]
=== Requests vs Limits

When allocating compute resources, each container may specify a request and a limit value
for either CPU or memory. The quota can be configured to quota either value.

If the quota has a value specified for `*requests.cpu*` or `*requests.memory*`,
then it requires that every incoming container makes an explicit request for
those resources. If the quota has a value specified for `*limits.cpu*` or
`*limits.memory*`, then it requires that every incoming container specifies an
explicit limit for those resources.

[[create-a-quota]]
== Creating a Quota

To create a quota, first define the quota to your specifications in a file, for
example as seen in
link:../admin_guide/quota.html#sample-resource-quota-definitions[Sample Resource
Quota Definitions]. Then, create using that file to apply it to a project:

----
$ oc create -f <resource_quota_definition> [-n <project_name>]
----

For example:

----
$ oc create -f resource-quota.json -n demoproject
----

[[viewing-a-quota]]
== Viewing a Quota

To view usage statistics related to any hard limits defined in a quota, first
get the list of quotas defined in the project. For example, for a project called
*demoproject*:

====
----
$ oc get quota -n demoproject
NAME                AGE
besteffort          11m
compute-resources   2m
object-counts       29m
----
====

Then, describe the resource quota you are interested in, for example a
*object-counts* quota:

====
----
$ oc describe quota object-counts -n demoproject
Name:			object-counts
Namespace:		demoproject
Resource		Used	Hard
--------		----	----
configmaps		3	10
persistentvolumeclaims	0	4
replicationcontrollers	3	20
secrets			9	10
services		2	10
----
====

[[configuring-quota-sync-period]]
== Configuring Quota Synchronization Period

When a set of resources are deleted, the synchronization time frame of resources
is determined by the `*resource-quota-sync-period*` setting in the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file.

Before quota usage is restored, a user may encounter problems when attempting to
reuse the resources. You can change the `*resource-quota-sync-period*` setting
to have the set of resources regenerate at the desired amount of time (in
seconds) and for the resources to be available again:

====
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  apiLevels:
  - v1beta3
  - v1
  apiServerArguments: null
  controllerArguments:
    resource-quota-sync-period:
      - "10s"
----
====

After making any changes, restart the master service to apply them.

Adjusting the regeneration time can be helpful for creating resources and
determining resource usage when automation is used.

[NOTE]
====
The `*resource-quota-sync-period*` setting is designed to balance system
performance. Reducing the sync period can result in a heavy load on the master.
