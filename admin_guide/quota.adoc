== Overview

// tag::admin_quota_overview[]
A resource quota, defined by a `*ResourceQuota*` object, provides constraints
that limit aggregate resource consumption per project. It can limit the quantity
of objects that can be created in a project by type, as well as the total amount
of compute resources and storage that may be consumed by resources in that project.

// end::admin_quota_resources_managed[]

You can configure an object count quota for these standard namespaced resource types using the `count/<resource>.<group>` syntax 
while xref:create-a-quota[creating a quota]. 

----
$ oc create quota <name> --hard=count/<resource>.<group>=<quota> <1>
----

<1> `<resource>` is the name of the resource, and `<group>` is the API group, if applicable. 
Use the `kubectl api-resources` command for a list of resources and their associated API groups.

[[quota-scopes]]
== Quota Scopes

// tag::admin_quota_scopes[]
Each quota can have an associated set of _scopes_. A quota will only
measure usage for a resource if it matches the intersection of enumerated
scopes.

Adding a scope to a quota restricts the set of resources to which that quota can
apply. Specifying a resource outside of the allowed set results in a validation
error.

[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Scope |Description

|*Terminating*
|Match pods where `spec.activeDeadlineSeconds >= 0`.

|*NotTerminating*
|Match pods where `spec.activeDeadlineSeconds` is `nil`.

|*BestEffort*
|Match pods that have best effort quality of service for either `*cpu*` or
`*memory*`. See the xref:../admin_guide/overcommit.adoc#qos-classes[Quality of
Service Classes] for more on committing compute resources.

|*NotBestEffort*
|Match pods that do not have best effort quality of service for `*cpu*` and
`*memory*`.
|===

A *BestEffort* scope restricts a quota to limiting the following resources:

- `*pods*`

A *Terminating*, *NotTerminating*, and *NotBestEffort* scope restricts a quota
to tracking the following resources:

- `*pods*`
- `*memory*`
- `*requests.memory*`
- `*limits.memory*`
- `*cpu*`
- `*requests.cpu*`
- `*limits.cpu*`
// end::admin_quota_scopes[]

[[quota-enforcement]]
== Quota Enforcement

// tag::admin_quota_enforcement[]
After a resource quota for a project is first created, the project restricts the
ability to create any new resources that may violate a quota constraint until it
has calculated updated usage statistics.

After a quota is created and usage statistics are updated, the project accepts
the creation of new content. When you create or modify resources, your quota
usage is incremented immediately upon the request to create or modify the
resource.

When you delete a resource, your quota use is decremented during the next full
recalculation of quota statistics for the project.
// end::admin_quota_enforcement[]
A xref:configuring-quota-sync-period[configurable amount of time] determines
how long it takes to reduce quota usage statistics to their current observed
system value.

If project modifications exceed a quota usage limit, the server denies the
action, and an appropriate error message is returned to the user explaining the
quota constraint violated, and what their currently observed usage stats are in
the system.


[[requests-vs-limits]]
== Requests Versus Limits

// tag::admin_quota_requests_vs_limits[]
When allocating
xref:../dev_guide/compute_resources.adoc#dev-compute-resources[compute
resources], each container may specify a request and a limit value each for
CPU and memory. Quotas can restrict any of these values.

If the quota has a value specified for `*requests.cpu*` or `*requests.memory*`,
then it requires that every incoming container make an explicit request for
those resources. If the quota has a value specified for `*limits.cpu*` or
`*limits.memory*`, then it requires that every incoming container specify an
explicit limit for those resources.

[[create-a-quota]]
== Creating a Quota

To create a quota, first define the quota in a file, 
such as the examples in
xref:../admin_guide/quota.adoc#sample-resource-quota-definitions[Sample Resource
Quota Definitions]. Then, create using that file to apply it to a project:

----
$ oc create -f <resource_quota_definition> [-n <project_name>]
----

For example:

----
$ oc create -f core-object-counts.yaml -n demoproject
----

=== Creating Object Count Quotas

You can create an xref:object-counts-managed-quota[object count quota] 
for all {product-title} standard namespaced resource types, such as *BuildConfig*, and *DeploymentConfig*. 
An object quota count places a defined quota on all standard namespaced resource types. 

When using a resource quota, an object is charged against the quota if it exists in server storage. 
These types of quotas are useful to protect against exhaustion of storage resources. 

To configure an object count quota for a resource, run the following command:

----
$ oc create quota <name> --hard=count/<resource>.<group>=<quota>,count/<resource>.<group>=<quota>
----

For example:

----
$ oc create quota test --hard=count/deployments.extensions=2,count/replicasets.extensions=4,count/pods=3,count/secrets=4
resourcequota "test" created

$ oc describe quota test
Name:                         test
Namespace:                    quota
Resource                      Used  Hard
--------                      ----  ----
count/deployments.extensions  0     2
count/pods                    0     3
count/replicasets.extensions  0     4
count/secrets                 0     4
----

This example limits the listed resources to the hard limit in each project in the cluster.

[[viewing-a-quota]]
== Viewing a Quota

// tag::admin_quota_viewing[]
You can view usage statistics related to any hard limits defined in a project's
quota by navigating in the web console to the project's *Quota* page.

You can also use the CLI to view quota details:

. First, get the list of quotas defined in the project. For example, for a project
called *demoproject*:
+

----
$ oc get quota -n demoproject
NAME                AGE
besteffort          11m
compute-resources   2m
core-object-counts  29m
----


. Then, describe the quota you are interested in, for example the
*core-object-counts* quota:
+

----
$ oc describe quota core-object-counts -n demoproject
Name:			core-object-counts
Namespace:		demoproject
Resource		Used	Hard
--------		----	----
configmaps		3	10
persistentvolumeclaims	0	4
replicationcontrollers	3	20
secrets			9	10
services		2	10
----

// end::admin_quota_viewing[]

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
[[configuring-quota-sync-period]]
== Configuring Quota Synchronization Period

When a set of resources are deleted, the synchronization time frame of resources
is determined by the `*resource-quota-sync-period*` setting in the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file.

Before quota usage is restored, a user may encounter problems when attempting to
reuse the resources. You can change the `*resource-quota-sync-period*` setting
to have the set of resources regenerate at the desired amount of time (in
seconds) and for the resources to be available again:


[source,yaml]
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  apiLevels:
  - v1beta3
  - v1
  apiServerArguments: null
  controllerArguments:
    resource-quota-sync-period:
      - "10s"
----


After making any changes, restart the master services to apply them.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
# systemctl restart origin-master-api origin-master-controllers
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api atomic-openshift-master-controllers
----
endif::[]

Adjusting the regeneration time can be helpful for creating resources and
determining resource usage when automation is used.

[NOTE]
====
The `*resource-quota-sync-period*` setting is designed to balance system
performance. Reducing the sync period can result in a heavy load on the master.
====
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
[[accounting-quota-dc]]
== Accounting for Quota in Deployment Configurations

If a quota has been defined for your project, see
xref:../dev_guide/deployments/basic_deployment_operations.adoc#deployment-resources[Deployment Resources]
for considerations on any deployment configurations.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
[[limited-resources-quota]]
== Require Explicit Quota to Consume a Resource

If a resource is not managed by quota, a user has no restriction
on the amount of resource that can be consumed.  For example,
if there is no quota on storage related to the gold storage class,
the amount of gold storage a project can create is unbounded.

For high-cost compute or storage resources, administrators may
want to require an explicit quota be granted in order to consume
a resource.  For example, if a project was not explicitly given quota
for storage related to the gold storage class, users of that project
would not be able to create any storage of that type.

In order to require explicit quota to consume a particular resource,
the following stanza should be added to the master-config.yaml.


[source,yaml]
----
admissionConfig:
  pluginConfig:
    ResourceQuota:
      configuration:
        apiVersion: resourcequota.admission.k8s.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Configuration
        limitedResources:
        - resource: persistentvolumeclaims <1>
        matchContains:
        - gold.storageclass.storage.k8s.io/requests.storage <2>
----
<1> The group/resource to whose consumption is limited by default.
<2> The name of the resource tracked by quota associated with the group/resource to limit by default.


In the above example, the quota system will intercept every operation that
creates or updates a `PersistentVolumeClaim`.  It checks what resources understood
by quota would be consumed, and if there is no covering quota for those resources
in the project, the request is denied.  In this example, if a user creates a
`PersistentVolumeClaim` that uses storage associated with the gold storage class,
and there is no matching quota in the project, the request is denied.

endif::[]
