== Overview

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
When a person uses the command line or web console, their API token
authenticates them to the OpenShift API. However, when a regular user's
credentials are not available, it is common for components to make API calls
independently. For example:

* Replication controllers make API calls to create or delete pods
* Applications inside containers can make API calls for discovery purposes
* External applications can make API calls for monitoring or integration purposes

endif::[]
Service accounts provide a flexible way to control API access without sharing a regular user's credentials.

== Usernames and groups

Every service account has an associated username that can be granted roles, just like a regular user.
The username is derived from its project and name: *system:serviceaccount:<project>:<name>*

For example, to add the *view* role to the *robot* service account in the *top-secret* project:
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:top-secret:robot
----

Every service account is also a member of two groups:

* *system:serviceaccounts*, which includes all service accounts in the system
* *system:serviceaccounts:<project>*, which includes all service accounts in the specified project

For example, to allow all service accounts in all projects to view resources in the *top-secret* project:
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-group view system:serviceaccounts -n top-secret
----

To allow all service accounts in the *managers* project to edit resources in the *top-secret* project:
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-group edit system:serviceaccounts:managers -n top-secret
----

== Enable service account authentication

Service accounts authenticate to the API using tokens signed by a private RSA key. The authentication layer verifies the signature using a matching public RSA key.

To enable service account token generation, update the
link:../install_config/master_node_configuration.html#master-configuration-files[master configuration]
`serviceAccountConfig` stanza to specify a `privateKeyFile` (for signing), and a
matching public key file in the `publicKeyFiles` list:

====
----
serviceAccountConfig:
  ...
  masterCA: ca.crt <1>
  privateKeyFile: serviceaccounts.private.key <2>
  publicKeyFiles:
  - serviceaccounts.public.key <3>
  - ...
----
<1> CA file used to validate the API server's serving certificate
<2> Private RSA key file (for token signing)
<3> Public RSA key files (for token verification). If private key files are
provided, then the public key component is used. Multiple public key files can
be specified, and a token will be accepted if it can be validated by one of
the public keys. This allows rotation of the signing key, while still
accepting tokens generated by the previous signer.
====

== Managed service accounts

Service accounts are required in each project to run builds, deployments, and
other pods. The `managedNames` setting in the
link:../install_config/master_node_configuration.html#master-configuration-files[master configuration]
file controls which service accounts are automatically created in every project:

====
----
serviceAccountConfig:
  ...
  managedNames: <1>
  - builder <1>
  - deployer <2>
  - default <3>
  - ...
----
<1> List of service accounts to automatically create in every project
<2> A *builder* service account in each project is required by build pods, and is given the *system:image-builder* role, which allows pushing images to any image stream in the project using the internal Docker registry.
<3> A *deployer* service account in each project is required by deployment pods, and is given the *system:deployer* role, which allows viewing and modifying replication controllers and pods in the project.
<4> A *default* service account is used by all other pods unless they specify a different service account.
====

All service accounts in a project are given the *system:image-puller* role, which allows pulling images from any image stream in the project using the internal Docker registry.

== Infrastructure service accounts

Several infrastructure controllers run using service account credentials.
The following service accounts are created in the OpenShift infrastructure namespace at server start, and given the following roles cluster-wide:

* The *replication-controller* service account is assigned the *system:replication-controller* role
* The *deployment-controller* service account is assigned the *system:deployment-controller* role
* The *build-controller* service account is assigned the *system:build-controller* role. Additionally, the *build-controller* service account is included in the privileged link:manage_scc.html[security context constraint] in order to create privileged build pods.

To configure the namespace where those service accounts are created, set the `openshiftInfrastructureNamespace` field in the
link:../install_config/master_node_configuration.html#master-configuration-files[master configuration] file:

====
----
policyConfig:
  ...
  openshiftInfrastructureNamespace: openshift-infra
----
====

Set `limitSecretReferences` field in link:../install_config/master_node_configuration.html#master-configuration-files[master configuration]
file to `true` to require pod secret references to be whitelisted by their service accounts.
Set its value to `false` to allow pods to reference any secret in the namespace.

====
----
serviceAccountConfig:
  ...
  limitSecretReferences: false
