== Overview

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
When a person uses the {product-title} CLI or web console, their API token
authenticates them to the {product-title} API. However, when a regular user's
credentials are not available, it is common for components to make API calls
independently. For example:

* Replication controllers make API calls to create or delete pods.
* Applications inside containers can make API calls for discovery purposes.
* External applications can make API calls for monitoring or integration purposes.

endif::[]
Service accounts provide a flexible way to control API access without sharing a
regular user's credentials.

[[admin-sa-user-names-and-groups]]
// tag::sa-user-names-and-groups[]
== User Names and Groups

Every service account has an associated user name that can be granted roles,
just like a regular user. The user name is derived from its project and name:

----
system:serviceaccount:<project>:<name>
----

For example, to add the *view* role to the *robot* service account in the
*top-secret* project:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:top-secret:robot
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you want to grant access to a specific service account in a project, you can
use the `-z` flag. From the project to which the service account belongs, use
the `-z` flag and specify the `<serviceaccount_name>`. This is highly
recommended, as it helps prevent typos and ensures that access is granted only
to the specified service account. For example:

----
 $ oc policy add-role-to-user <role_name> -z <serviceaccount_name>
----

If not in the project, use the `-n` option to indicate the project namespace it
applies to, as shown in the examples below.
====

Every service account is also a member of two groups:

system:serviceaccounts:: Includes all service accounts in the system.
system:serviceaccounts:<project>:: Includes all service accounts in the
specified project.

For example, to allow all service accounts in all projects to view resources in
the *top-secret* project:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-group view system:serviceaccounts -n top-secret
----

To allow all service accounts in the *managers* project to edit resources in the
*top-secret* project:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-group edit system:serviceaccounts:managers -n top-secret
----

[[dedicated-admin-granting-service-accounts-access]]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
== Granting Service Accounts Access to Dedicated-Admin Roles

As an {product-title} administrator, you can use service accounts to perform any
actions that require {product-title} *admin* roles.

The *dedicated-admin* service creates the
xref:../admin_guide/index.adoc#admin-guide-index-dedicated-admin-role[*dedicated-admins*
group]. This group is granted the roles at the cluster or individual project
level. Users can be assigned to this group and group membership defines who has
{product-title} administrator access. However, by design, service accounts
cannot be added to regular groups.

Instead, the *dedicated-admin* service creates a special project for this
purpose named *dedicated-admin*. The service account group for this project is
granted {product-title} *admin* roles, granting {product-title} administrator
access to all service accounts within the *dedicated-admin* project. These
service accounts can then be used to perform any actions that require
{product-title} administrator access.

Users that are members of the *dedicated-admins* group, and thus have been
granted the *dedicated-admin* role, have `edit` access to the *dedicated-admin*
project. This allows these users to manage the service accounts in this project
and create new ones as needed.

Users with a *dedicated-reader* role are granted edit and view access to the
*dedicated-reader* project and view-only access to the other projects.

ifdef::openshift-online,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated,openshift-aro,openshift-enterprise[]
== Managing Service Accounts

Service accounts are API objects that exist within each project. To manage
service accounts, you can use the `oc` command with the `sa` or `serviceaccount`
object type or use the web console.

To get a list of existing service accounts in the current project:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get sa
NAME       SECRETS   AGE
builder    2         2d
default    2         2d
deployer   2         2d
----

To create a new service account:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create sa robot
serviceaccount "robot" created
----
endif::[]

ifdef::atomic-registry[]
[[managing-service-account-credentials]]
== Managing Service Account Credentials
endif::[]

As soon as a service account is created, two secrets are automatically added to
it:

* an API token
* credentials for the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin,openshift-online,openshift-dedicated[]
OpenShift Container Registry
endif::[]
ifdef::atomic-registry[]
internal registry
endif::[]

These can be seen by describing the service account:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe sa robot
Name:		robot
Namespace:	project1
Labels:		<none>
Annotations:	<none>

Image pull secrets:	robot-dockercfg-qzbhb

Mountable secrets: 	robot-token-f4khf
                   	robot-dockercfg-qzbhb

Tokens:            	robot-token-f4khf
                   	robot-token-z8h44

----

The system ensures that service accounts always have an API token and registry
credentials.

The generated API token and registry credentials do not expire, but they can be
revoked by deleting the secret. When the secret is deleted, a new one is
automatically generated to take its place.

[[enabling-service-account-authentication]]
== Enabling Service Account Authentication

Service accounts authenticate to the API using tokens signed by a private RSA
key. The authentication layer verifies the signature using a matching public RSA
key.

To enable service account token generation, update the `*serviceAccountConfig*`
stanza in the *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yml_* file on the master to
specify a `*privateKeyFile*` (for signing), and a matching public key file in
the `*publicKeyFiles*` list:

====
----
serviceAccountConfig:
  ...
  masterCA: ca.crt <1>
  privateKeyFile: serviceaccount.private.key <2>
  publicKeyFiles:
  - serviceaccount.public.key <3>
  - ...
----
<1> CA file used to validate the API server's serving certificate.
<2> Private RSA key file (for token signing).
<3> Public RSA key files (for token verification). If private key files are
provided, then the public key component is used. Multiple public key files can
be specified, and a token will be accepted if it can be validated by one of the
public keys. This allows rotation of the signing key, while still accepting
tokens generated by the previous signer.
====

[[managed-service-accounts]]
== Managed Service Accounts

Service accounts are required in each project to run builds, deployments, and
other pods. The `*managedNames*` setting in the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yml_* file on the master controls which
service accounts are automatically created in every project:

====
----
serviceAccountConfig:
  ...
  managedNames: <1>
  - builder <2>
  - deployer <3>
  - default <4>
  - ...
----
<1> List of service accounts to automatically create in every project.
<2> A *builder* service account in each project is required by build pods, and is
given the *system:image-builder* role, which allows pushing images to any image
stream in the project using the internal container image registry.
<3> A *deployer* service account in each project is required by deployment pods, and
is given the *system:deployer* role, which allows viewing and modifying
replication controllers and pods in the project.
<4> A *default* service account is used by all other pods unless they specify a
different service account.
====

All service accounts in a project are given the *system:image-puller* role,
which allows pulling images from any image stream in the project using the
internal container image registry.

[[infrastructure-service-accounts]]
== Infrastructure Service Accounts

Several infrastructure controllers run using service account credentials. The
following service accounts are created in the {product-title} infrastructure
project (*openshift-infra*) at server start, and given the following roles
cluster-wide:

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|====
|Service Account |Description

|*replication-controller*
|Assigned the *system:replication-controller* role

|*deployment-controller*
|Assigned the *system:deployment-controller* role

|*build-controller*
|Assigned the *system:build-controller* role. Additionally, the
*build-controller* service account is included in the privileged
security context constraint in order to create privileged
build pods.
|====

To configure the project where those service accounts are created, set the
`*openshiftInfrastructureNamespace*` field in the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yml_* file on the master:

====
----
policyConfig:
  ...
  openshiftInfrastructureNamespace: openshift-infra
----
====

[[service-accounts-and-secrets]]
== Service Accounts and Secrets

Set the `*limitSecretReferences*` field in the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yml_* file on the master to `true` to require
pod secret references to be whitelisted by their service accounts. Set its value
to `false` to allow pods to reference any secret in the project.

====
----
serviceAccountConfig:
  ...
  limitSecretReferences: false
----
====
