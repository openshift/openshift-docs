== Overview

xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#builds[Builds]
in {product-title} are run in
xref:../install/prerequisites.adoc#security-warning[privileged containers] that
have access to the Docker daemon socket. As a security measure, it is
recommended to limit who can run builds and the strategy that is used for those
builds.
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#custom-build[Custom
builds] are inherently less safe than
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#source-build[Source
builds], given that they can execute any code in the build with potentially full
access to the node's Docker socket, and as such are disabled by default.
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#docker-build[Docker
build] permission should also be granted with caution as a vulnerability in the Docker build
logic could result in a privileges being granted on the host node.

[WARNING]
====
During Docker and custom builds, actions performed by the Docker daemon are privileged and
occur in the host network namespace. Such actions bypass configured networking rules
including those defined by EgressNetworkPolicy objects and static egress IP addresses.
====

By default, all users that can create builds are granted permission to use the
Docker and Source-to-Image build strategies. Users with xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[*cluster-admin*]
privileges can enable the Custom build strategy, as referenced in the xref:restricting-build-strategies-to-a-user-globally[Restricting Build Strategies to a User Globally]
section of this page.

You can control who can build with what build strategy using an
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authorization[authorization
policy]. Each build strategy has a corresponding build subresource.
A user must have permission to create a build _and_ permission to create
on the build strategy subresource in order to create builds using that strategy.
Default roles are provided which grant the *create* permission on the build strategy subresource.

== Disabling a Build Strategy Globally
To prevent access to a particular build strategy globally, log in as a user with
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[*cluster-admin*]
privileges, remove the corresponding role from the *system:authenticated* group, and apply the annotation `openshift.io/reconcile-protect: "true"` to protect them from changes between the API restarts. The following example shows disabling the docker build strategy.

. Apply the `openshift.io/reconcile-protect` annotation
+
[source, bash]
----
$ oc edit clusterrolebinding system:build-strategy-docker-binding

apiVersion: v1
groupNames:
- system:authenticated
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/reconcile-protect: "true" <1>
  creationTimestamp: 2018-08-10T01:24:14Z
  name: system:build-strategy-docker-binding
  resourceVersion: "225"
  selfLink: /oapi/v1/clusterrolebindings/system%3Abuild-strategy-docker-binding
  uid: 17b1f3d4-9c3c-11e8-be62-0800277d20bf
roleRef:
  name: system:build-strategy-docker
subjects:
- kind: SystemGroup
  name: system:authenticated
userNames:
- system:serviceaccount:management-infra:management-admin
----
<1> Change the `openshift.io/reconcile-protect` annotation's value to `"true"`. By default, it is set to `"false"`.

. Remove the role:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-group system:build-strategy-docker system:authenticated
----

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
In versions prior to 1.2, the build strategy subresources were included in the `admin` and `edit` roles.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
In versions prior to 3.2, the build strategy subresources were included in the `admin` and `edit` roles.
endif::[]

Ensure the build strategy subresources are also removed from these roles:

----
$ oc edit clusterrole admin
$ oc edit clusterrole edit
----

For each role, remove the line that corresponds to the resource of the strategy to disable.

.Disable the Docker Build Strategy for *admin*
[source, yaml]
----
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: admin
...
rules:
- resources:
  - builds/custom
  - builds/docker <1>
  - builds/source
  ...
...
----
<1> Delete this line to disable Docker builds globally for users with the *admin* role.

[[restricting-build-strategies-to-a-user-globally]]

== Restricting Build Strategies to a User Globally

To allow only a set of specific users to create builds with a particular strategy:

. xref:disabling-a-build-strategy-globally[Disable global access to the build strategy].

. Assign the role corresponding to the build strategy to a specific user.
For example, to add the *system:build-strategy-docker* cluster role to the user *devuser*:
+
====
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user system:build-strategy-docker devuser
----
====

[WARNING]
====
Granting a user access at the cluster level to the *builds/docker* subresource
means that the user will be able to create builds with the Docker strategy in
any project in which they can create builds.
====

[[restricting-build-strategies-to-a-user-within-a-project]]

== Restricting Build Strategies to a User Within a Project

Similar to granting the build strategy role to a user globally, to allow only a
set of specific users within a project to create builds with a particular
strategy:

. xref:disabling-a-build-strategy-globally[Disable global access to the build strategy].

. Assign the role corresponding to the build strategy to a specific user within a project.
For example, to add the *system:build-strategy-docker* role within the project *devproject* to the user *devuser*:
+
====
----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user system:build-strategy-docker devuser -n devproject
----
====
