== Overview

link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#builds[Builds]
in OpenShift are run in
link:../install_config/install/prerequisites.html#security-warning[privileged containers] that
have access to the Docker daemon socket. As a security measure, it is
recommended to limit who can run builds and the strategy that is used for those
builds.
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#custom-build[Custom
builds] are inherently less safe than
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[Source
builds], given that they can execute any code in the build with potentially full
access to the node's Docker socket.  link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#docker-build[Docker
build] permission should also be granted with caution as a vulnerability in the Docker build 
logic could result in a privileges being granted on the host node.

By default, project administrators (the
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[*admin* role])
and project editors (the
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[*edit* role])
are granted permission to use all build strategies (Docker, Source-to-Image, and
Custom).

You can control who can build with what build strategy using an
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html[authorization
policy]. Each build strategy has a corresponding build subresource. Granting
permission to *create* on the build subresource allows the user to create builds
of that type.

== Disabling a Build Strategy Globally
To prevent access to a particular build strategy globally, log in as a user with
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[*cluster-admin*]
privileges and edit each of the default roles:

----
$ oc edit clusterrole admin
$ oc edit clusterrole edit
----

For each role, remove the line that corresponds to the resource of the strategy to disable:

.Disable the Docker Build Strategy for *admin*
=====

----
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: admin
...

rules:
- attributeRestrictions: null
  resources:
  - builds/custom
  - builds/docker <1>
  - builds/source
  - pods/exec
  - pods/portforward

...
----
<1> Delete this line to disable Docker builds globally for users with the
*admin* role.

== Restricting Build Strategies to a User Globally

To allow only a set of specific users to create builds with a particular
strategy:

. link:#disabling-a-build-strategy-globally[Remove the build strategy
subresource from the default *admin* and *edit* roles].

. [[create-separate-role]]Create a separate role for the build strategy. For
example, create a *_dockerstrategy.yaml_* file that defines a separate role for
the Docker build strategy:
+
====

[source,yaml]
----
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: dockerbuilder
rules:
- resources:
  - builds/docker
  verbs:
  - create
----
====
+
As cluster administrator, create the new cluster role:
+
====
----
$ oc create -f dockerstrategy.yaml
----
====

. Assign the new cluster role to a specific user. For example, to add the new *dockerbuilder* cluster role to the user *devuser*:
+
====

----
$ oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user dockerbuilder devuser
----
====

[WARNING]
====
Granting a user access at the cluster level to the *builds/docker* subresource
means that the user will be able to create builds with the Docker strategy in
any project in which they can create builds.

== Restricting Build Strategies to a User Within a Project

Similar to granting the build strategy role to a user globally, to allow only a
set of specific users within a project to create builds with a particular
strategy:

. link:#disabling-a-build-strategy-globally[Remove the build strategy resource
from the default *admin* and *edit* roles].
. link:#create-separate-role[Create a separate role for that build strategy.]
. Assign the role to a specific user within a project. For example, to add the
new *dockerbuilder* role within the project *devproject* to the user *devuser*:
+
====

----
$ oadm policy add-role-to-user dockerbuilder devuser -n devproject
----
