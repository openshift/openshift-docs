== Overview

Your {product-title} cluster by default comes loaded with a core set of image
streams and templates, which are accessible by all users across the cluster via
the global *openshift* project. As a cluster administrator, you can add, remove,
and edit these defaults at your discretion.

The following sections detail the default image streams and templates, and show
how to modify them or create new ones in the global *openshift* project.
