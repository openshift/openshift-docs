If you lose etcd quorum, you must back up etcd, take down your etcd cluster,
and form a new one. You can use one healthy etcd node to form a new cluster, 
but you must remove all other healthy nodes.

[NOTE]
====
During etcd quorum loss, applications that run on {product-title} are
unaffected. However, the platform functionality is limited to read-only
operations. You cannot take action such as scaling an application up or down, 
changing deployments, or running or modifying builds.
====

To confirm the loss of etcd quorum, run the following command and confirm
that the cluster is unhealthy:

----
# ETCDCTL_API=2 etcdctl  --cert-file=/etc/origin/master/master.etcd-client.crt  \
          --key-file /etc/origin/master/master.etcd-client.key \
          --ca-file /etc/origin/master/master.etcd-ca.crt \
          --endpoints="https://*master-0.example.com*:2379,\
          https://*master-1.example.com*:2379,\
          https://*master-2.example.com*:2379"\
          cluster-health

member 165201190bf7f217 is unhealthy: got unhealthy result from https://master-0.example.com:2379
member b50b8a0acab2fa71 is unreachable: [https://master-1.example.com:2379] are all unreachable
member d40307cbca7bc2df is unreachable: [https://master-2.example.com:2379] are all unreachable
cluster is unhealthy
----

Note the member IDs and host names of the hosts. You use one of the nodes that
can be reached to form a new cluster.
