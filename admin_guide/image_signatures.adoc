== Overview

Container image signing on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) systems provides a
means of:

- Validating where a container image came from,
- Checking that the image has not been tampered with, and
- Setting policies to determine which validated images can be pulled to a host.

For a more complete understanding of the architecture of container image signing
on RHEL systems, see the
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2750891#architecture[Container Image Signing Integration Guide].

The OpenShift Container Registry allows the ability to store signatures via REST
API. The `oc` CLI can be used to verify image signatures, with their validated
displayed in the web console or CLI.

[[signing-images-using-atomic-cli]]
== Signing Images Using Atomic CLI

{product-title} does not automate image signing. Signing requires a developer's
private GPG key, typically stored securely on a workstation. This document
describes that workflow.

The `atomic` command line interface (CLI), version 1.12.5 or greater, provides
commands for signing container images, which can be pushed to an OpenShift
Container Registry. The `atomic` CLI is available on Red Hat-based
distributions: RHEL, Centos, and Fedora.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The `atomic` CLI is pre-installed on RHEL Atomic Host systems. For information
on installing the *atomic* package on a RHEL host, see
xref:../install/host_preparation.adoc#enabling-image-signature-support[Enabling Image Signature Support].
endif::[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `atomic` CLI uses the authenticated credentials from `oc login`. Be sure to
use the same user on the same host for both `atomic` and `oc` commands. For example,
if you execute `atomic` CLI as `sudo`, be sure to log in to {product-title}
using `sudo oc login`.
====

In order to attach the signature to the image, the user must have the
`image-signer` cluster role.
ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
Cluster administrators can add this using:

----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user system:image-signer <user_name>
----
endif::[]

Images may be signed at push time:

----
$ atomic push [--sign-by <gpg_key_id>] --type atomic <image>
----

Signatures are stored in {product-title} when the `atomic` transport type
argument is specified. See
xref:../security/deployment.adoc#security-deployment-signature-transports[Signature Transports] for more information.

For full details on how to set up and perform image signing using the `atomic`
CLI, see the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html/managing_containers/signing_container_images[RHEL Atomic Host Managing Containers: Signing Container Images] documentation
or the `atomic push --help` output for argument details.

A specific example workflow of working with the `atomic` CLI and an OpenShift
Container Registry is documented in the
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2750891#working-with-openshift-and-atomic-registry[Container Image Signing Integration Guide].

[[verifying-image-signatures-using-openshift-cli]]
== Verifying Image Signatures Using OpenShift CLI

You can verify the signatures of an image imported to an OpenShift Container
Registry using the `oc adm verify-image-signature` command. This command
verifies if the image identity contained in the image signature can be trusted
by using the public GPG key to verify the signature itself then match the
provided expected identity with the identity (the pull spec) of the given image.

By default, this command uses the public GPG keyring located in
*_$GNUPGHOME/pubring.gpg_*, typically in path *_~/.gnupg_*. By default, this
command does not save the result of the verification back to the image object.
To do so, you must specify the `--save` flag, as shown below.

[NOTE]
====
In order to verify the signature of an image, the user must have the
`image-auditor` cluster role.
ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
Cluster administrators can add this using:

----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user system:image-auditor <user_name>
----
endif::[]
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Using the `--save` flag on already verified image together with invalid GPG key
or invalid expected identity causes the saved verification status and all
signatures to be removed, and the image will become unverified. 

In order to avoid deleting all signatures by mistake, you can run the command 
without the `--save` flag first and check the logs for potential issues.
====

To verify an image signature use the following format:

----
$ oc adm verify-image-signature <image> --expected-identity=<pull_spec> [--save] [options]
----

The `<pull_spec`> can be found by describing the image stream.
The `<image>` may be found by describing the image stream tag.
See the following example command output.

[[accessing-image-signatures-using-registry-api]]
== Accessing Image Signatures Using Registry API

The OpenShift Container Registry provides an `extensions` endpoint that allows
you to write and read image signatures. The image signatures are stored in the
{product-title} key-value store via the Docker Registry API.

[NOTE]
====
This endpoint is experimental and not supported by the upstream Docker Registry
project. See the link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/[upstream API
documentation] for general information about the Docker Registry API.
====

[[writing-image-signatures-using-registry-api]]
=== Writing Image Signatures via API

In order to add a new signature to the image, you can use the HTTP `PUT` method
to send a JSON payload to the `extensions` endpoint:

----
PUT /extensions/v2/<namespace>/<name>/signatures/<digest>
----

----
$ curl -X PUT --data @signature.json http://<user>:<token>@<registry_endpoint>:5000/extensions/v2/<namespace>/<name>/signatures/sha256:<digest>
----

The JSON payload with the signature content should have the following structure:

----
{
  "version": 2,
  "type":    "atomic",
  "name":    "sha256:4028782c08eae4a8c9a28bf661c0a8d1c2fc8e19dbaae2b018b21011197e1484@cddeb7006d914716e2728000746a0b23",
  "content": "<cryptographic_signature>"
}
----

The `name` field contains the name of the image signature, which must be unique
and in the format `<digest>@<name>`. The `<digest>` represents an image name and
the `<name>` is the name of the signature. The signature name must be 32
characters long. The `<cryptographic_signature>` must follow the specification
documented in the
link:https://github.com/containers/image/blob/master/docs/atomic-signature.md#the-cryptographic-signature[containers/image] library.

[[reading-image-signatures-via-registry-api]]
=== Reading Image Signatures via API

Assuming a signed image has already been pushed into the OpenShift Container
Registry, you can read the signatures using the following command:

----
GET /extensions/v2/<namespace>/<name>/signatures/<digest>
----

----
$ curl http://<user>:<token>@<registry_endpoint>:5000/extensions/v2/<namespace>/<name>/signatures/sha256:<digest>
----

The `<namespace>` represents the {product-title} project name or registry
repository name and the `<name>` refers to the name of the image repository. The
`digest` represents the SHA-256 checksum of the image.

If the given image contains the signature data, the output of the command above
should produce following JSON response:

----
{
  "signatures": [
  {
    "version": 2,
    "type":    "atomic",
    "name":    "sha256:4028782c08eae4a8c9a28bf661c0a8d1c2fc8e19dbaae2b018b21011197e1484@cddeb7006d914716e2728000746a0b23",
    "content": "<cryptographic_signature>"
  }
  ]
}
----

The `name` field contains the name of the image signature, which must be unique
and in the format `<digest>@<name>`. The `<digest>` represents an image name and
the `<name>` is the name of the signature. The signature name must be 32
characters long. The `<cryptographic_signature>` must follow the specification
documented in the
link:https://github.com/containers/image/blob/master/docs/atomic-signature.md#the-cryptographic-signature[containers/image] library.

[[importing-signatures-from-sigstore]]
=== Importing Image Signatures Automatically from Signature Stores

{product-title} can automatically import image signatures if a signature
store is configured on all {product-title} master nodes through the registries
configuration directory. 

The registries configuration directory contains the configuration 
for various registries (servers storing remote container images) 
and for the content stored in them. The single directory ensures that the configuration 
does not have to be provided in command-line options for each command, 
so that it can be shared by all the users of the containers/image.

The default registries configuration directory is
located in the *_/etc/containers/registries.d/default.yaml_* file. 

A sample configuration that will cause image signatures to be imported
automatically for all Red Hat images:

----
docker:
  registry.access.redhat.com:
    sigstore: https://access.redhat.com/webassets/docker/content/sigstore <1>
----

<1> Defines the URL of a signature store. This URL is used for reading existing signatures.

[NOTE] 
====
Signatures imported automatically by {product-title} will be
_unverified_ by default and will have to be verified by image administrators.
====

For more details about the registries configuration directory, see
link:https://github.com/containers/image/blob/master/docs/registries.d.md[Registries Configuration Directory].
