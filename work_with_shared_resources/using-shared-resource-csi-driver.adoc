Storage vendors have traditionally provided storage drivers as part of Kubernetes. With the implementation of the Container Storage Interface (CSI), third-party providers can deliver storage plugins by using a standard interface without changing the core Kubernetes code. CSI Operators give Builds users storage options, such as volume snapshots, that are not possible with in-tree volume plugins.

Shared resources CSI driver is a special type of CSI driver that allows cluster administrators to securely share 'Secrets' and 'ConfigMaps' objects across namespaces using the 'csi' volume type. The Shared resources CSI driver provisions inline ephemeral volumes, enabling pods and {ocp-product-title} Builds to use these shared resources. 

Shared resources CSI driver supports the following types of custom resources:

* `SharedSecret` custom resource for sharing `Secret` objects
* `SharedConfigMap` custom resource for `ConfigMap` objects

As a cluster administrator, you can use the Shared Resource Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver in any Kubernetes object that uses the volume type as `csi` to provision inline ephemeral volumes that contain the contents of `Secret` or `ConfigMap` objects. This way, pods and other Kubernetes types that expose volume mounts, and {ocp-product-title} Builds can securely use the contents of those objects across potentially any namespace in the cluster. To accomplish this, there are currently two types of shared resources:

* `SharedSecret` custom resource for `Secret` objects
* `SharedConfigMap` custom resource for `ConfigMap` objects
