Storage vendors have traditionally provided storage drivers as a part of Kubernetes. With the implementation of the Container Storage Interface (CSI), third-party providers can deliver storage plugins by using a standard interface without changing the core Kubernetes code. CSI Operators give {builds-shortname}' users storage options, such as volume snapshots that are not possible with in-tree volume plugins.

The Shared Resource CSI driver is a special type of CSI driver that allows cluster administrators to securely share `Secret` and `ConfigMap` objects across namespaces by using the `csi` volume type. The Shared resources CSI driver provisions inline ephemeral volumes, enabling pods and {ocp-product-title} Builds to use these shared resources.

The Shared Resource CSI driver supports the following types of custom resources:

* `SharedSecret` custom resource for sharing `Secret` objects
* `SharedConfigMap` custom resource for sharing `ConfigMap` objects
