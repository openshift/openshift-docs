Storage vendors have traditionally provided storage drivers as part of Kubernetes. With the implementation of the Container Storage Interface (CSI), third-party providers can deliver storage plugins by using a standard interface without changing the core Kubernetes code.
CSI Operators give {builds-shortname} users storage options, such as volume snapshots, that are not possible with in-tree volume plugins.

A Shared Resources CSI Driver is a type of CSI driver that allows Kubernetes pods to access and share certain host resources, such as files or sockets, across multiple pods and nodes.As a cluster administrator, you can use the Shared Resource CSI Driver to provision inline ephemeral volumes from `Secret` or `ConfigMap` objects using 'csi' volume type. This way, pods and other Kubernetes types that expose volume mounts, and {ocp-product-title} Builds can securely use the contents of those objects across potentially any namespace in the cluster.

Currently, you can share the following types of resources using the Shared Resources CSI Driver:

* `SharedSecret` custom resource for sharing `Secret` objects
* `SharedConfigMap` custom resource for sharing `ConfigMap` objects
