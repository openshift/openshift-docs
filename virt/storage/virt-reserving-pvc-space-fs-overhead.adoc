toc::[]

When you add a virtual machine disk to a persistent volume claim (PVC) that uses the `Filesystem` volume mode, you must ensure that there is enough space on the PVC for the VM disk and for file system overhead, such as metadata.

By default, {VirtProductName} reserves 5.5% of the PVC space for overhead, reducing the space available for virtual machine disks by that amount.

You can configure a different overhead value by editing the `HCO` object. You can change the value globally and you can specify values for specific storage classes.
