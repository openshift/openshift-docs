`DataVolume` objects are custom resources provided by the Containerized Data Importer (CDI). Data volumes automate the import, clone, and upload operations associated with an underlying persistent volume claim (PVC).

You can create a data volume as a standalone resource or by using the `dataVolumeTemplate` field in the VM specification.

If you create a standalone data volume resource, the lifecycle of the VM disk is independent from the VM lifecycle. If you use the `dataVolumeTemplate` field, the disk shares the same lifecycle as the VM.
