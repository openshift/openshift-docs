= Cloning a virtual machine disk into a new data volume

toc::[]

You can clone the persistent volume claim (PVC) of a virtual machine (VM) disk into a new data volume. Then, you can attach the data volume clone to a new VM as a disk.

[WARNING]
====
You can clone between different volume modes, such as block volumes to file system volumes, as long as both PVCs are of the `contentType: kubevirt`.
====

[TIP]
====
When you enable preallocation globally, or for a single data volume, the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) preallocates disk space during cloning. Preallocation enhances write performance. For more information, see xref:../../virt/storage/virt-using-preallocation-for-datavolumes.adoc#virt-using-preallocation-for-datavolumes[Using preallocation for data volumes].
====

== Prerequisites

* Users need xref:../../virt/storage/virt-enabling-user-permissions-to-clone-datavolumes.adoc#virt-enabling-user-permissions-to-clone-datavolumes[additional permissions] to clone the PVC of a virtual machine disk into another namespace.
