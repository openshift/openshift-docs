You must configure storage profiles if your storage provider is not recognized by the Containerized Data Importer (CDI)

A storage profile provides recommended storage settings based on the associated storage class. A storage profile is allocated for each storage class.

For recognized storage types, CDI provides values that optimize the creation of PVCs.  However, you can configure automatic settings for a storage class if you customize the storage profile.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using {VirtProductName} with {rh-storage-first}, specify RBD block mode persistent volume claims (PVCs) when creating virtual machine disks. RBD block mode volumes are more efficient and provide better performance than Ceph FS or RBD filesystem-mode PVCs.

To specify RBD block mode PVCs, use the 'ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd' storage class and `VolumeMode: Block`.
