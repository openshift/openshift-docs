In addition to creating virtual machines (VM) using templates or instances in the web console, you can also create VMs from custom operating system images by using one of the following methods:

* xref:../../virt/creating_vms_advanced/creating_vms_cli/virt-creating-vms-from-container-disks.adoc#virt-creating-vms-from-container-disks[Importing the image as a container disk from a registry].
+
Optional: You can enable auto updates for your container disks. See xref:../../virt/storage/virt-automatic-bootsource-updates.adoc#virt-automatic-bootsource-updates[Managing automatic boot source updates] for details.

* xref:../../virt/creating_vms_advanced/creating_vms_advanced_web/virt-creating-vms-from-web-images.adoc#virt-creating-vms-from-web-images[Importing the image from a web page].
* xref:../../virt/creating_vms_advanced/creating_vms_advanced_web/virt-creating-vms-uploading-images.adoc#virt-creating-vms-uploading-images[Uploading the image from a local machine].
* xref:../../virt/creating_vms_advanced/creating_vms_cli/virt-creating-vms-by-cloning-pvcs.adoc#virt-creating-vms-by-cloning-pvcs[Cloning a persistent volume claim (PVC) that contains the image].

The Containerized Data Importer (CDI) imports the image into a PVC by using a data volume. You add the PVC to the VM by using the {product-title} web console or command line.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must install the xref:../../virt/managing_vms/virt-installing-qemu-guest-agent.adoc#virt-installing-qemu-guest-agent[QEMU guest agent] on VMs created from operating system images that are not provided by Red Hat.

You must also install xref:../../virt/managing_vms/virt-installing-qemu-guest-agent.adoc#installing-virtio-drivers[VirtIO drivers] on Windows VMs.

The QEMU guest agent is included with Red Hat images.
====





You can create virtual machines (VMs) from the command line by editing or creating a `VirtualMachine` manifest. You can simplify VM configuration by using an xref:../../virt/creating_vm/virt-creating-vms-from-instance-types.adoc#virt-creating-vms-from-instance-types[instance type] in your VM manifest.

[NOTE]
====
You can also xref:../../virt/creating_vm/virt-creating-vms-from-instance-types.adoc#virt-creating-vm-instancetype_virt-creating-vms-from-instance-types[create VMs from instance types by using the web console].
