By default, {VirtProductName} is installed with a single, internal pod network.

After you install {VirtProductName}, you can install networking Operators and configure additional networks.

== Installing networking Operators

You must install the xref:../../networking/k8s_nmstate/k8s-nmstate-about-the-k8s-nmstate-operator.adoc#k8s-nmstate-about-the-k8s-nmstate-operator[Kubernetes NMState Operator] to configure a Linux bridge network for live migration or external access to virtual machines (VMs).

You can install the xref:../../networking/hardware_networks/about-sriov.adoc#about-sriov[SR-IOV Operator] to manage SR-IOV network devices and network attachments.

== Configuring a network for live migration

After you have configured a Linux bridge network, you can configure a dedicated network for live migration. A dedicated network minimizes the effects of network saturation on tenant workloads during live migration.
