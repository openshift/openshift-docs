You must configure a default storage class for your cluster. Otherwise, the cluster cannot receive automated boot source updates. See xref:../../post_installation_configuration/storage-configuration.adoc#defining-storage-classes_post-install-storage-configuration[Defining a storage class] for details.

You can configure local storage by using the hostpath provisioner (HPP).

[id="configuring-local-storage-hpp"]
== Configuring local storage by using the HPP

When you install the {VirtProductName} Operator, the Hostpath Provisioner (HPP) Operator is automatically installed. The HPP Operator creates the HPP provisioner.

The HPP is a local storage provisioner designed for {VirtProductName}. To use the HPP, you must create an HPP custom resource (CR).

[IMPORTANT]
====
HPP storage pools must not be in the same partition as the operating system. Otherwise, the storage pools might fill the operating system partition. If the operating system partition is full, performance can be effected or the node can become unstable or unusable.
