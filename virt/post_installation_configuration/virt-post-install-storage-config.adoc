The following storage configuration tasks are mandatory:

ifndef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* You must configure a xref:../../storage/dynamic-provisioning.adoc#defining-storage-classes_dynamic-provisioning[default storage class] for your cluster. Otherwise, the cluster cannot receive automated boot source updates.
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* You must configure xref:../../virt/storage/virt-configuring-storage-profile.adoc#virt-configuring-storage-profile[storage profiles] if your storage provider is not recognized by the Containerized Data Importer (CDI). A storage profile provides recommended storage settings based on the associated storage class.

Optional: You can configure local storage by using the hostpath provisioner (HPP).

See the xref:../../virt/storage/virt-storage-config-overview.adoc#virt-storage-config-overview[storage configuration overview] for more options, including configuring the CDI, data volumes, and automatic boot source updates.

== Configuring local storage by using the HPP

When you install the {VirtProductName} Operator, the Hostpath Provisioner (HPP) Operator is automatically installed. The HPP Operator creates the HPP provisioner.

The HPP is a local storage provisioner designed for {VirtProductName}. To use the HPP, you must create an HPP custom resource (CR).

[IMPORTANT]
====
HPP storage pools must not be in the same partition as the operating system. Otherwise, the storage pools might fill the operating system partition. If the operating system partition is full, this might negatively impact performance, or the node can become unstable or unusable.
