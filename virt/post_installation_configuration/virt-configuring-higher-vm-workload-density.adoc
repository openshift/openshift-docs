toc::[]

[role="_abstract"]
To increase the number of virtual machines (VMs), you can configure a higher VM workload density in your cluster by overcommitting the amount of memory (RAM).

:FeatureName: Configuring higher workload density
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

The following workloads are especially suited for higher workload density:

* Many similar workloads
* Underused workloads

[NOTE]
====
While overcommitted memory can lead to a higher workload density, it can also lower workload performance of a highly utilized system.
