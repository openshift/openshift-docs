toc::[]

You can increase the number of virtual machines (VMs) on nodes by overcommitting memory (RAM). Increasing VM workload density can be useful in the following situations:

* You have many similar workloads.
* You have underused workloads.

[NOTE]
====
Memory overcommitment can lower workload performance on a highly utilized system.
