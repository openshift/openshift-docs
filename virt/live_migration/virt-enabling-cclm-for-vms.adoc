Cross-cluster live migration enables users to move a virtual machine (VM) workload from one {product-title} cluster to another cluster without disruption. You enable cross-cluster live migration by setting cluster feature gates in {VirtProductName} and {mtv-first}.

.Prerequisites

* {VirtProductName} 4.20 or later must be installed.

* The {product-title} and {VirtProductName} minor release versions must match. For example, if the {product-title} version is 4.20.0, the {VirtProductName} must also be 4.20.0.

* Two {product-title} clusters are required, and the migration network for both clusters must be connected to the same L2 network segment.

* You must have cluster administration privileges and appropriate RBAC privileges to manage VMs on both clusters.
