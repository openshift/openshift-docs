You have several options available to choose from when you want to create a virtual machine (VM), depending on whether you want to get the VM up and running quickly or be able to customize the VM slightly before you start it. You can create a VM from the {product-title} web console.

If your goal is to create a VM quickly by using pre-existing Red Hat resources, such as for particular workloads, you can create a VM from an instance type. Instance type configuration in this case is minimal: You choose a boot volume, select an available resource size for CPU and memory, name the VM, and apply other pre-defined, non-configurable settings. You can optionally start the VM after it has been created.

You can also create a VM from an instance type and add a volume rather than using a pre-existing boot volume.

If you want to create a VM that you can customize either before or after it is created, you can use a template. From the
{product-title} web console, you can choose a template that has a boot source or requires you to supply one. You can customize disk source and VM parameters before you start the VM.

Red Hat bootable volumes or boot sources are fully configured disk images that include configured drivers.

== Advanced options

To create a VM with a deeper level of customization or on supported third-party platforms, you can optionally use one of the following more advanced procedures:

* Providing your own base operating system image or boot source
* Defining a custom instance type
* Creating a VM template
* Cloning a VM template
* Copying an existing snapshot
