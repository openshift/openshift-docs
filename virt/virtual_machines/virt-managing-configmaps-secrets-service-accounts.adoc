You can use secrets, ConfigMaps, and service accounts to pass configuration data to virtual machines. For example, you can:

* Give a virtual machine access to a service that requires credentials by adding a secret to the virtual machine.
* Store non-confidential configuration data in a ConfigMap so that a Pod or another object can consume the data.
* Allow a component to access the API server by associating a service account with that component.

[NOTE]
====
{VirtProductName} exposes secrets, ConfigMaps, and service accounts as virtual machine disks so that you can use them across platforms without additional overhead.
