You can enable high availability for virtual machines (VMs) by manually deleting a failed node to trigger VM failover or by configuring remediating nodes.

.Manually deleting a failed node

If a node fails and machine health checks are not deployed on your cluster, virtual machines with `runStrategy: Always` configured are not automatically relocated to healthy nodes. To trigger VM failover, you must manually delete the `Node` object.

See xref:../../../virt/nodes/virt-triggering-vm-failover-resolving-failed-node.adoc#virt-triggering-vm-failover-resolving-failed-node[Deleting a failed node to trigger virtual machine failover].

.Configuring remediating nodes

You can configure remediating nodes by installing the Self Node Remediation Operator from the OperatorHub and enabling machine health checks or node remediation checks.

For more information on remediation, fencing, and maintaining nodes, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/workload_availability_for_red_hat_openshift/23.2/html-single/remediation_fencing_and_maintenance/index#about-remediation-fencing-maintenance[Workload Availability for Red Hat OpenShift] documentation.
