Virtual machines can have resources of a node, such as CPU,
dedicated to them in order to improve performance.

== Prerequisites

* The
xref:../../../scalability_and_performance/using-cpu-manager.adoc[CPU Manager]  must
be configured on the node. Verify that the node has the `cpumanager` = `true`
label before scheduling virtual machine workloads.
