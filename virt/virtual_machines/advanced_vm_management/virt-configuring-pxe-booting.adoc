PXE booting, or network booting, is available in {VirtProductName}.
Network booting allows a computer to boot and load an
operating system or other program without requiring a locally attached
storage device. For example, you can use it to choose your desired OS
image from a PXE server when deploying a new host.

== Prerequisites

* A Linux bridge must be xref:../../../virt/virtual_machines/vm_networking/virt-attaching-vm-multiple-networks.adoc#attaching-to-multiple-networks[connected].

* The PXE server must be connected to the same VLAN as the bridge.
