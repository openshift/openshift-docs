toc::[]

You can use boot sources that are _system-defined_ and included with {VirtProductName} or _user-defined_, which you create. System-defined boot source imports and updates are controlled by the product feature gate. You can enable, disable, or re-enable updates using the feature gate. User-defined boot sources are not controlled by the product feature gate and must be individually managed to opt in or opt out of automatic imports and updates.

[IMPORTANT]
====
As of version 4.10, {VirtProductName} automatically imports and updates boot sources, unless you manually opt out or do not set a default storage class.

If you upgrade to version 4.10, you must manually enable automatic imports and updates for boot sources from version 4.9 or earlier.
