= Cloning a virtual machine disk into a new block storage data volume

toc::[]

You can clone the persistent volume claim (PVC) of a virtual machine disk into
a new block data volume by referencing the source PVC in your data volume configuration
file.

[WARNING]
====
Cloning operations between different volume modes are supported, such as cloning from a persistent volume (PV) with `volumeMode: Block` to a PV with `volumeMode: Filesystem`.

However, you can only clone between different volume modes if they are of the `contentType: kubevirt`.
====

[TIP]
====
When you enable preallocation globally, or for a single data volume, the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) preallocates disk space during cloning. Preallocation enhances write performance. For more information, see xref:../../../virt/virtual_machines/virtual_disks/virt-using-preallocation-for-datavolumes.adoc#virt-using-preallocation-for-datavolumes[Using preallocation for data volumes].

== Prerequisites

* Users need xref:../../../virt/virtual_machines/cloning_vms/virt-enabling-user-permissions-to-clone-datavolumes.adoc#virt-enabling-user-permissions-to-clone-datavolumes[additional permissions] to clone the PVC of a virtual machine disk into another namespace.
