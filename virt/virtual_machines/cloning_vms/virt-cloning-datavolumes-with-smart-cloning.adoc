DataVolumes (DVs) can be created by specifying a persistent volume claim (PVC)
as an input source. This triggers a clone of the original PVC.

Cloning a PVC using the containerized data importer (CDI)
is done with host-assisted cloning by streaming the data from the source PVC
and writing the data to the new PVC. While effective, this can affect
performance.

In order to improve the performance of the cloning process,
use Smart-Cloning to improve performance where snapshots are used.

Using this procedure, you:
* Verify that the datavolume was created with a PVC source.
* Determine if you can use smart cloning on the datavolume.
* Smart clone the datavolume by using a snapshot of the source PVC.
