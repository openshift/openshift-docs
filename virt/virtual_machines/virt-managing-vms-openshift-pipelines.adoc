link:https://docs.openshift.com/pipelines/latest/about/understanding-openshift-pipelines.html[{pipelines-title}] is a Kubernetes-native CI/CD framework that allows developers to design and run each step of the CI/CD pipeline in its own container.

The Scheduling, Scale, and Performance (SSP) Operator integrates {VirtProductName} with {pipelines-shortname}. The SSP Operator includes tasks and example pipelines that allow you to:

* Create and manage virtual machines (VMs), persistent volume claims (PVCs), and data volumes
* Run commands in VMs
* Manipulate disk images with `libguestfs` tools

[id="prerequisites_virt-managing-vms-openshift-pipelines"]

== Windows EFI installer pipeline

You can run the link:https://artifacthub.io/packages/tekton-pipeline/redhat-pipelines/windows-efi-installer[Windows EFI installer pipeline] by using the web console or CLI.

The Windows EFI installer pipeline installs Windows 10, Windows 11, or Windows Server 2022 into a new data volume from a Windows installation image (ISO file). A custom answer file is used to run the installation process.

[NOTE]
====
The Windows EFI installer pipeline uses a config map file with `sysprep` predefined by {product-title} and suitable for Microsoft ISO files. For ISO files pertaining to different Windows editions, it may be necessary to create a new config map file with a system-specific `sysprep` definition.
