toc::[]

You can configure SSH access to virtual machines (VMs) by using the following methods:

* xref:virt/virtual_machines/virt-accessing-vm-ssh.adoc#using-virtctl-ssh_virt-accessing-vm-ssh[`virtctl ssh` command]
+
You create an SSH key pair, add the public key to a VM, and connect to the VM by running the `virtctl ssh` command with the private key.

* xref:virt/virtual_machines/virt-accessing-vm-ssh.adoc#virt-using-openssh-and-virtctl-port-forward_virt-accessing-vm-ssh[`virtctl port-forward` command]
+
You add the `virtctl port-foward` command to your `.ssh/config` file and connect to the VM by using OpenSSH.

* xref:virt/virtual_machines/virt-accessing-vm-ssh.adoc#using-services-ssh_virt-accessing-vm-ssh[Service]
+
You create a service, associate the service with the VM, and connect to the IP address and port exposed by the service.

* xref:virt/virtual_machines/virt-accessing-vm-ssh.adoc#using-secondary-networks-ssh_virt-accessing-vm-ssh[Secondary network]
+
You configure a secondary network, attach a virtual machine (VM) to the secondary network interface, and connect to the DHCP-allocated IP address.

== Using virtctl ssh

You can add a public SSH key to a virtual machine (VM) and connect to the VM by running the `virtctl ssh` command.

This method is simple to configure. However, it is not recommended for high traffic loads because it places a burden on the API server.

=== Adding an SSH key to a virtual machine

You can add a _static_ or _dynamic_ public SSH key to a virtual machine (VM) by using the {product-title} web console or the command line.

Static key::
* Added to the VM at startup.
* Uses the cloud-init configuration drive and does not affect cloud-init user data.
* Can be added when you create a VM by using the xref:virt/virtual_machines/virt-accessing-vm-ssh.adoc#adding-static-public-key-vm-web_virt-accessing-vm-ssh[web console] or the xref:virt/virtual_machines/virt-accessing-vm-ssh.adoc#adding-static-public-key-project-web_virt-accessing-vm-ssh[command line].
* Can be added to a xref:virt/virtual_machines/virt-accessing-vm-ssh.adoc#adding-static-public-key-project-web_virt-accessing-vm-ssh[project] by using the web console. Afterwards, the key is automatically added to the VMs that you create in this project.

Dynamic key::
* Can be added or revoked while the VM is running.
* Can be disabled for security reasons. If the setting is disabled, the VM inherits the key setting of the image from which it was created.
* Uses the QEMU guest agent.
* Only supported by {op-system-base-full} 9.

[TIP]
====
You can copy the `virtctl ssh` command in the web console by selecting *Copy SSH command* from the options {kebab} menu beside a VM on the xref:virt/getting_started/virt-web-console-overview.adoc#virtualmachines-page_virt-web-console-overview[*VirtualMachines* page].

== Using a service for SSH access

You can create a service for a virtual machine (VM) and connect to the IP address and port exposed by the service.

Services provide excellent performance and are recommended for applications that are accessed from outside the cluster or within the cluster. Ingress traffic is protected by firewalls.

If the cluster network cannot handle the traffic load, consider using a secondary network for VM access.

[id="creating-services-ssh_virt-accessing-vm-ssh"]
=== Creating a service

You can create a service to expose a virtual machine (VM) by using the {product-title} web console, `virtctl` command line tool, or a YAML file.

.Next steps

After you create a service with `virtctl`, you must add `special: key` to the `spec.template.metadata.labels` stanza of the `VirtualMachine` manifest. See xref:virt/virtual_machines/virt-accessing-vm-ssh.adoc#virt-creating-service-cli_virt-accessing-vm-ssh[Creating a service by using the command line].

== Using a secondary network for SSH access

You can configure a secondary network, attach a virtual machine (VM) to the secondary network interface, and connect to the DHCP-allocated IP address by using SSH.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Secondary networks provide excellent performance because the traffic is not handled by the cluster network stack. However, the VMs are exposed directly to the secondary network and are not protected by firewalls. If a VM is compromised, an intruder could gain access to the secondary network. You must configure appropriate security within the operating system of the VM if you use this method.

.Prerequisites

* You configured a secondary network such as xref:virt/vm_networking/virt-connecting-vm-to-linux-bridge.adoc#virt-connecting-vm-to-linux-bridge[Linux bridge] or xref:virt/vm_networking/virt-connecting-vm-to-sriov.adoc#virt-connecting-vm-to-sriov[SR-IOV].
* You created a network attachment definition for a xref:virt/vm_networking/virt-connecting-vm-to-linux-bridge.adoc#virt-creating-linux-bridge-nad-web_virt-connecting-vm-to-linux-bridge[Linux bridge network] or the SR-IOV Network Operator created a xref:virt/vm_networking/virt-connecting-vm-to-sriov.adoc#nw-sriov-network-attachment_virt-connecting-vm-to-sriov[network attachment definition] when you created an `SriovNetwork` object.
