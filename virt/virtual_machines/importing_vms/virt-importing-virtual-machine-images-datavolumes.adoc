Use the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) to import a virtual machine image into a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) by using a DataVolume. You can attach a DataVolume to a virtual machine for persistent storage.

The virtual machine image can be hosted at an HTTP or HTTPS endpoint, or built into a container disk and stored in a container registry.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you import a disk image into a PVC, the disk image is expanded to use the full storage capacity that is requested in the PVC. To use this space, the disk partitions and file system(s) in the virtual machine might need to be expanded.

The resizing procedure varies based on the operating system installed on the virtual machine. Refer to the operating system documentation for details.

== Prerequisites

* If the endpoint requires a TLS certificate, the certificate must be
xref:../../../virt/virtual_machines/importing_vms/virt-tls-certificates-for-dv-imports.adoc#virt-adding-tls-certificates-for-authenticating-dv-imports_virt-tls-certificates-for-dv-imports[included in a ConfigMap]
in the same namespace as the DataVolume and referenced in the DataVolume configuration.

* To import a container disk: 
** You might need to xref:../../../virt/virtual_machines/virtual_disks/virt-using-container-disks-with-vms.adoc#virt-preparing-container-disk-for-vms_virt-using-container-disks-with-vms[prepare a container disk from a virtual machine image] and store it in your container registry before importing it.
** If the container registry does not have TLS, you must xref:../../../virt/virtual_machines/virtual_disks/virt-using-container-disks-with-vms.adoc#virt-disabling-tls-for-registry_virt-using-container-disks-with-vms[add the registry to the `cdi-insecure-registries` ConfigMap] before you can import a container disk from it.

* You might need to xref:../../../virt/virtual_machines/virtual_disks/virt-preparing-cdi-scratch-space.adoc#virt-defining-storageclass-in-cdi-configuration_virt-preparing-cdi-scratch-space[define a StorageClass or prepare CDI scratch space]
for this operation to complete successfully.
