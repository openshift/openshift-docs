= Importing virtual machine images with DataVolumes

:context: virt-importing-virtual-machine-images-datavolumes
toc::[]

You can import an existing virtual machine image into your {product-title}
cluster. {VirtProductName} uses DataVolumes to automate the import of data and the
creation of an underlying PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).

[CAUTION]
====
When you import a disk image into a PVC, the disk image is
expanded to use the full storage capacity that is requested in the PVC. To use
this space, the disk partitions and file system(s) in the virtual machine
might need to be expanded.

The resizing procedure varies based on the operating system installed on the VM.
Refer to the operating system documentation for details.

== Prerequisites

* If the endpoint requires a TLS certificate, the certificate must be
xref:../../../virt/virtual_machines/importing_vms/virt-tls-certificates-for-dv-imports.adoc#virt-adding-tls-certificates-for-authenticating-dv-imports_virt-tls-certificates-for-dv-imports[included in a ConfigMap]
in the same namespace as the DataVolume and referenced in the DataVolume configuration.

* You may need to xref:../../../virt/virtual_machines/virtual_disks/virt-preparing-cdi-scratch-space.adoc#virt-defining-storageclass-in-cdi-configuration_virt-preparing-cdi-scratch-space[define a StorageClass or prepare CDI scratch space]
for this operation to complete successfully.
