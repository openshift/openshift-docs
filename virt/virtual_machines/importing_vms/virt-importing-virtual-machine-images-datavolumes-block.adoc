You can import an existing virtual machine image into your {product-title}
cluster. {VirtProductName} uses data volumes to automate the import of data and the
creation of an underlying persistent volume claim (PVC).

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you import a disk image into a PVC, the disk image is
expanded to use the full storage capacity that is requested in the PVC. To use
this space, the disk partitions and file system(s) in the virtual machine
might need to be expanded.

The resizing procedure varies based on the operating system that is installed on the virtual machine.
Refer to the operating system documentation for details.

== Prerequisites

* If you require scratch space according to the
xref:#virt-cdi-supported-operations-matrix_virt-importing-virtual-machine-images-datavolumes-block[CDI supported operations matrix], you must first
xref:../../../virt/virtual_machines/virtual_disks/virt-preparing-cdi-scratch-space.adoc#virt-defining-storageclass-in-cdi-configuration_virt-preparing-cdi-scratch-space[define a storage class or prepare CDI scratch space]
for this operation to complete successfully.
