When the QEMU guest agent runs on the virtual machine, you can use the web console to view information about the virtual machine, users, file systems, and secondary networks.

If the QEMU guest agent is not installed, the *Overview* and the *Details* tabs display information about the operating system that was specified when the virtual machine was created.
