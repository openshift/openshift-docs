You can export a virtual machine (VM) and its associated disks in order to import a VM into another cluster or to analyze the volume for forensic purposes.

You create a `VirtualMachineExport` custom resource (CR) by using the command line interface.

Alternatively, you can use the xref:../../virt/virt-using-the-cli-tools.adoc#vm-volume-export-commands_virt-using-the-cli-tools[`virtctl vmexport` command] to create a `VirtualMachineExport` CR and to download exported volumes.
