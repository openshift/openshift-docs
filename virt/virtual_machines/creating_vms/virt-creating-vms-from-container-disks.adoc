toc::[]

You can create virtual machines (VMs) by using container disks.

You build a custom image into a container disk and upload it to your container registry. If your container registry does not have TLS you must add it as an insecure registry before you can import container disks into persistent storage.

Then, you can import the container disk into persistent storage by using a data volume.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you use large container disks, I/O traffic might increase and might cause worker nodes to be unavailable. You can perform the following tasks to resolve this issue:

* xref:../../../nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-garbage-collection.adoc#nodes-nodes-garbage-collection-configuring_nodes-nodes-configuring[Configuring garbage collection]
