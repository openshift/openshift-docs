You can create virtual machines (VMs) from a Red Hat image, such as {op-system-base-full}, Fedora, or CentOS, or from a custom image, such as Ubuntu.

== Creating VMs from Red Hat images

You can create a virtual machine (VM) from a Red Hat image by using one of the following methods:

* Creating a VM from a template.
* Creating a VM from an instance type.
* Creating a VM from a `VirtualMachine` manifest.

Red Hat images are xref:../../../virt/virtual_machines/creating_vms/virt-about-creating-vms.adoc#virt-about-golden-images_virt-about-creating-vms[golden images]. They are published as container disks in a secure registry.

The Containerized Data Importer (CDI) polls and imports the container disks into your cluster and stores them in the `openshift-virtualization-os-images` project as snapshots or persistent volume claims (PVCs). Red Hat images are automatically updated.

[id="creating-vms-from-custom-images_about-creating-vms"]
== Creating VMs from custom images

You can create a virtual machine (VM) from a custom image by using one of the following methods:

* Building an image into a container disk and uploading it to a registry.
* Importing the image from a web page.
* Uploading the image from a local machine.
* Clone a persistent volume claim (PVC) that contains the image.

The Containerized Data Importer (CDI) imports the image into a PVC by using a data volume. You add the PVC to the VM by using the {product-title} web console or command line.

[NOTE]
====
You must install the QEMU guest agent on VMs created from custom images.

The QEMU guest agent is installed with Red Hat data sources.
