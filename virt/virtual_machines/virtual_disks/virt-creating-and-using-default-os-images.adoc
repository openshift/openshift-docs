A _default operating system (OS) image_ is a bootable disk containing an OS and all of the configuration settings for the OS, such as drivers. You use a default OS image to create bootable virtual machines with specific configurations.

To use default OS images, you must install the latest version of {VirtProductName}. You then create a persistent volume claim (PVC) by using the {product-title} web console to upload a default OS image to the PVC. After uploading, you create virtual machines or virtual machine templates from the uploaded images by using the wizard in the web console.
