You can build a virtual machine image into a container disk and store it in your container registry. You can then import the container disk into persistent storage for a virtual machine or attach it directly to the virtual machine for ephemeral storage.

If your container registry does not have TLS you must add it as an insecure registry before you can import container disks into persistent storage.
