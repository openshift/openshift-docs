A boot source contains a bootable operating system (OS) and all of the configuration settings for the OS, such as drivers.

You use a boot source to create virtual machine templates with specific configurations. These templates can be used to create any number of available virtual machines.

Quick Start tours are available in the {product-title} web console to assist you in creating a custom boot source, uploading a boot source, and other tasks. Select *Quick Starts* from the *Help* menu to view the Quick Start tours.
