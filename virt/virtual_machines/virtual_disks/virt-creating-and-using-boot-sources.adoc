toc::[]

A _boot source_ contains a bootable operating system (OS) and all of the configuration settings for the OS, such as drivers.

You use a boot source to create virtual machine templates with specific configurations. These templates can be used to create any number of available virtual machines.

.Prerequisites
* To add a boot source, you must be logged in as a user with the `os-images.kubevirt.io:edit` RBAC role or as an administrator. You do not need special privileges to create a virtual machine from a template with a boot source attached.
