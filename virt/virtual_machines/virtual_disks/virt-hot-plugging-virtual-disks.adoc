Hot-plug and hot-unplug virtual disks when you want to add or remove them without stopping your virtual machine or virtual machine instance. This capability is helpful when you need to add storage to a running virtual machine without incurring down-time.

When you _hot-plug_ a virtual disk, you attach a virtual disk to a virtual machine instance while the virtual machine is running.

When you _hot-unplug_ a virtual disk, you detach a virtual disk from a virtual machine instance while the virtual machine is running.

Only data volumes and persistent volume claims (PVCs) can be hot-plugged and hot-unplugged. You cannot hot-plug or hot-unplug container disks.
