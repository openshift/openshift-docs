toc::[]

You can create and delete virtual machine (VM) snapshots for VMs, whether the VMs are powered off (offline) or on (online). You can only restore to a powered off (offline) VM. {VirtProductName} supports VM snapshots on the following:

* {rh-storage-first}
* Any other storage provider with the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver that supports the Kubernetes Volume Snapshot API

Online snapshots have a default time deadline of five minutes (`5m`) that can be changed, if needed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Online snapshots are supported for virtual machines that have hot-plugged virtual disks. However, hot-plugged disks that are not in the virtual machine specification are not included in the snapshot.
====

[NOTE]
====
To create snapshots of an online (Running state) VM with the highest integrity, install the QEMU guest agent.

The QEMU guest agent takes a consistent snapshot by attempting to quiesce the VMâ€™s file system as much as possible, depending on the system workload. This ensures that in-flight I/O is written to the disk before the snapshot is taken. If the guest agent is not present, quiescing is not possible and a best-effort snapshot is taken. The conditions under which the snapshot was taken are reflected in the snapshot indications that are displayed in the web console or CLI.
