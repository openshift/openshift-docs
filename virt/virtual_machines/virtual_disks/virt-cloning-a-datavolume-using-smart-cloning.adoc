Smart-cloning is a built-in feature of {product-title} Storage (OCS),
designed to enhance performance of the cloning process. Clones created with smart-cloning are faster and more efficient than host-assisted cloning.

You do not need to perform any action to enable smart-cloning, but you need to ensure your storage environment is compatible with smart-cloning to use this feature.

When you create a data volume with a persistent volume claim (PVC) source, you automatically initiate the cloning process. You always receive a clone of the data volume if your environment supports smart-cloning or not. However, you will only receive the performance benefits of smart cloning if your storage provider supports smart-cloning.
