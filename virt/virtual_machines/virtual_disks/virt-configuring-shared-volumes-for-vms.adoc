You can configure shared disks to allow multiple virtual machines (VMs) to share the same underlying storage. A shared disk's volume must be block mode.

You configure disk sharing by exposing the storage as either of these types:

* An ordinary virtual machine disk
* A logical unit number (LUN) device with an iSCSi connection and raw device mapping, as required for Windows Failover Clustering for shared volumes
