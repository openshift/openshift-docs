toc::[]

Virtual machines that use local volume storage can be moved so that they run on a specific node.

You might want to move the virtual machine to a specific node for the following reasons:

* The current node has limitations to the local storage configuration.
* The new node is better optimized for the workload of that virtual machine.

To move a virtual machine that uses local storage, you must clone the underlying volume by using a data volume. After the cloning operation is complete, you can xref:../../../virt/virtual_machines/virt-edit-vms.adoc#virt-edit-vms[edit the virtual machine configuration] so that it uses the new data volume, or xref:../../../virt/virtual_machines/virt-edit-vms.adoc#virt-vm-add-disk_virt-edit-vms[add the new data volume to another virtual machine].

[TIP]
====
When you enable preallocation globally, or for a single data volume, the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) preallocates disk space during cloning. Preallocation enhances write performance. For more information, see xref:../../../virt/virtual_machines/virtual_disks/virt-using-preallocation-for-datavolumes.adoc#virt-using-preallocation-for-datavolumes[Using preallocation for data volumes].

Users without the `cluster-admin` role require xref:../../../virt/virtual_machines/cloning_vms/virt-enabling-user-permissions-to-clone-datavolumes.adoc#virt-enabling-user-permissions-to-clone-datavolumes[additional user permissions] to clone volumes across namespaces.
