The Containerized Data Importer (CDI) allows adding specific annotations to a data volume (DV) or persistent volume claim (PVC) to be passed to the Transfer Pods and control their behavior. However, only specifically allowed annotations are passed to prevent unexpected behavior due to missing testing coverage.

A pod may have multiple containers within it that may need to share resources. You may have a pod with a data volume container and also a separate sidecar container that maintains the files in data volume container. Using a sidecar injection annotation allows you to control the sidecar so it does not interfere with other OpenShift features such as builder pods used by numerous frameworks within OpenShift.
