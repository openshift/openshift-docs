You can create virtual machines (VMs) by cloning existing persistent volume claims (PVCs) with custom images.

You must install the xref:../../../virt/virtual_machines/creating_vms_custom/virt-installing-qemu-guest-agent.adoc#virt-installing-qemu-guest-agent[QEMU guest agent] on VMs created from operating system images that are not provided by Red Hat.

You clone a PVC by creating a data volume that references a source PVC.

== Creating a VM from a PVC by using the command line

You can create a virtual machine (VM) by cloning the persistent volume claim (PVC) of an existing VM by using the command line.

You can clone a PVC by using one of the following options:

* Cloning a PVC to a new data volume.
+
This method creates a data volume whose lifecycle is independent of the original VM. Deleting the original VM does not affect the new data volume or its associated PVC.

* Cloning a PVC by creating a `VirtualMachine` manifest with a `dataVolumeTemplates` stanza.
+
This method creates a data volume whose lifecycle is dependent on the original VM. Deleting the original VM deletes the cloned data volume and its associated PVC.
