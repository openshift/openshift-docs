{VirtProductName} is now integrated with OpenShift Service Mesh. You can monitor, visualize, and control traffic between pods that run virtual machine workloads on the default pod network with IPv4.

== Prerequisites

* You must have xref:../../../service_mesh/v2x/installing-ossm.adoc#installing-ossm[installed the Service Mesh Operator] and xref:../../../service_mesh/v2x/ossm-create-smcp.adoc#ossm-create-smcp[deployed the service mesh control plane].

* You must have added the namespace where the virtual machine is created to the xref:../../../service_mesh/v2x/ossm-create-mesh.adoc#ossm-create-mesh[service mesh member roll].

* You must use the `masquerade` binding method for the default pod network.
