The QEMU guest agent runs on the virtual machine and passes the IP address of attached NICs to the host, allowing you to view the IP address from both the web console and the `oc` client.

== Prerequisites

. Verify that the guest agent is installed and running by entering the following command:
+
----
$ systemctl status qemu-guest-agent
----
+
. If the guest agent is not installed and running, xref:../../../virt/virtual_machines/vm_networking/virt-installing-qemu-guest-agent.adoc#virt-installing-qemu-guest-agent[install and run the guest agent on the virtual machine].
