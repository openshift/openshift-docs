You can attach virtual machines to multiple networks by using Linux bridges.
You can also import virtual machines with existing workloads that depend on access to multiple interfaces.

To attach a virtual machine to an additional network:

. Configure a bridge network attachment definition for a namespace in the web console or CLI.
. Attach the virtual machine to the network attachment definition by using either the web console or the CLI:
** In the web console, create a NIC for a new or existing virtual machine.
** In the CLI, include the network information in the virtual machine configuration.

=== Prerequisites

* A Linux bridge must be configured and attached on every node.
See the xref:../../../virt/node_network/virt-updating-node-network-config.adoc#virt-about-nmstate_virt-updating-node-network-config[node networking] section for more information.

[WARNING]
====
Configuring ipam in a network attachment definition for virtual machines is not supported.
