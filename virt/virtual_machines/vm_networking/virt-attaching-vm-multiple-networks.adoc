{VirtProductName} provides layer-2 networking capabilities that allow you to connect
virtual machines to multiple networks. You can import virtual machines with
existing workloads that depend on access to multiple interfaces. You can also
configure a PXE network so that you can boot machines over the network.

To get started, a network administrator configures a bridge network attachment definition
for a namespace in the web console or CLI. Users can then create a NIC to attach pods and virtual machines in that namespace to the bridge network.

== Creating a network attachment definition

== Prerequisites

* A Linux bridge must be configured and attached on every node.
See the xref:../../../virt/node_network/virt-updating-node-network-config.adoc#virt-about-nmstate_virt-updating-node-network-config[node networking] section for more information.

[WARNING]
====
Configuring ipam in a network attachment definition for virtual machines is not supported.

[NOTE]
====
When defining the NIC in the next section, ensure that the *NETWORK* value is
the bridge network name from the network attachment definition you created
in the previous section.
