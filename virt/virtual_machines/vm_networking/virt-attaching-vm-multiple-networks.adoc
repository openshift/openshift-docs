toc::[]

By default, {VirtProductName} is installed with a single, internal pod network.

You must create a Linux bridge network attachment definition (NAD) in order to connect to additional networks.

To attach a virtual machine to an additional network:

. Create a Linux bridge node network configuration policy.
. Create a Linux bridge network attachment definition.
. Configure the virtual machine, enabling the virtual machine to recognize the network attachment definition.

For more information about scheduling, interface types, and other node networking activities,
see the xref:../../../networking/k8s_nmstate/k8s-nmstate-updating-node-network-config.adoc#k8s-nmstate-updating-node-network-config[node networking]
section.
