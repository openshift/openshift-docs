You can attach virtual machines to multiple networks by using Linux bridges.
You can also import virtual machines with existing workloads that depend on access to multiple interfaces.

To attach a virtual machine to an additional network:

. Configure a Linux bridge.
. Configure a bridge network attachment definition for a namespace in the web console or CLI.
+
[NOTE]
====
The network attachment definition must be in the same namespace as the pod or virtual machine.
====
. Attach the virtual machine to the network attachment definition by using either the web console or the CLI:
** In the web console, create a NIC for a new or existing virtual machine.
** In the CLI, include the network information in the virtual machine configuration.

[NOTE]
====
There are multiple methods for configuring a VLAN, including network attachment definition and node network configuration policy.
However, a network attachment definition provides a more efficient and more manageable configuration.
