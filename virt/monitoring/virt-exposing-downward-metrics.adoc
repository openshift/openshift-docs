toc::[]

As an administrator, you can expose a limited set of host and virtual machine (VM) metrics to a guest VM by first enabling a `downwardMetrics` feature gate and then configuring a `downwardMetrics` device.

Users can view the metrics results by using the command line or the `vm-dump-metrics tool`.

[NOTE]
====
On Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9, use the command line to view downward metrics. See xref:../../virt/monitoring/virt-exposing-downward-metrics.adoc#virt-viewing-downward-metrics-cli_virt-exposing-downward-metrics[Viewing downward metrics by using the command line].

The vm-dump-metrics tool is not supported on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9 platform.
