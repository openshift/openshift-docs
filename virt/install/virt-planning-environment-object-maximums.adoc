= Planning your environment according to {VirtProductName} object maximums
:context: virt-planning-environment-object-maximums

toc::[]

You can plan your {VirtProductName} {VirtVersion} cluster by considering tested object maximums. Guidelines for object maximums are based on the largest possible cluster. For smaller clusters, the maximums are lower. In most cases, exceeding these numbers results in lower overall performance. It does not necessarily mean that the cluster will fail.

Informations about the limitations that apply to guests and {VirtProductName} can be found at https://access.redhat.com/articles/6571671.
