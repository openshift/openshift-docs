= Installing an {ove} cluster in a disconnected environment
:context: installing-ove

toc::[]

The following procedures describe a method to install a {ove-first} cluster that uses a simplified user interface. This method does not require you to set up an external image registry in disconnected environments, which is a requirement for all other disconnected installation methods.

:FeatureName: Installing an {ove} cluster using this method
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

// Is it bad to mix mentions of OVE above and plain Virt below?

This method has the following advantages for users who want to install a cluster primarily to run virtualized workloads using {VirtProductName}:

Simplified web interface:: The cluster installation is performed through a graphical user interface.
In addition to providing reasonable default configurations, this interface guides you through the installation by providing hints and warnings about configuring your cluster, without limiting the configurations that are available at installation time.
This reduces the need for in-depth knowledge of {product-title} while still allowing for complex configurations to be made.

No external registry needed:: If you are installing your cluster in a disconnected environment, you do not need to configure an external image registry in your environment when using this method.
All other disconnected installation methods require this additional environment setup.

Included Operator bundle:: You can install the Virtualization bundle, which includes all of the additional {olm-first} Operators needed to run virtual machines on your cluster, at the same time as the cluster installation.

[NOTE]
====
This installation method does not come with any storage Operators as part of the Operator bundle.
You must configure your own storage solution separately.

// Probably need some section for limitations such as bare metal machines, unless that's a commonly understood requirement for virt.

// Completing cluster configuration and initiating the installation
include::modules/installing-ove-console-final.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

During the installation process, the rendezvous node reboots and the console you used to configure the installation is no longer accessible.
At that point, the URL of the deployed cluster's web console is provided, although this console is not accessible until the cluster installation is completed.

Once the cluster is installed, you can visit this URL and sign in to the web console with your downloaded credentials.

== Next steps

After a successful cluster installation, you can take the following next steps to prepare your cluster to run virtualized workloads:

* xref:../../virt/getting_started/virt-using-the-cli-tools.adoc#installing-virtctl_virt-using-the-cli-tools[Install the `virtctl` command line tool] to manage virtualization resources from the command line.

* Create a virtual machine from an xref:../../virt/creating_vm/virt-creating-vms-from-instance-types.adoc#virt-creating-vms-from-instance-types[instance type], from a xref:../../virt/creating_vm/virt-creating-vms-from-templates.adoc#virt-creating-vms-from-templates[template], or by using more xref:../../virt/creating_vms_advanced/advanced-vm-creation-overview.adoc#advanced-vm-creation-overview[advanced methods].

* Use the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV) to migrate virtual machines from other virtualization providers, such as link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/2.8/html/installing_and_using_the_migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/migrating-vmware[VMware vSphere] or link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/2.8/html/installing_and_using_the_migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/migrating-rhv_rhv[Red{nbsp}Hat Virtualization].
