You might want to additionally configure the following components:

* The _KubeMacPool_ component provides a MAC address pool service for virtual machine NICs in designated namespaces. xref:../../virt/virtual_machines/vm_networking/virt-using-mac-address-pool-for-vms.adoc#virt-about-kubemacpool_virt-using-mac-address-pool-for-vms[Enable a MAC address pool in a namespace] by applying the KubeMacPool label to that namespace.

* The xref:../../virt/virtual_machines/virtual_disks/virt-configuring-local-storage-for-vms.adoc#virt-about-hostpath-provisioner_virt-configuring-local-storage-for-vms[hostpath provisioner] is a local storage provisioner designed for {VirtProductName}. If you want to configure local storage for virtual machines, you must enable the hostpath provisioner first.
