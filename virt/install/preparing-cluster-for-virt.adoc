= Preparing your cluster for {VirtProductName}
:context: virt-installation-requirements

toc::[]

Review this section before you install {VirtProductName} to ensure that your cluster meets the requirements.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can use any installation method, including user-provisioned, installer-provisioned, or assisted installer, to deploy {product-title}. However, the installation method and the cluster topology might affect {VirtProductName} functionality, such as snapshots or live migration.
====

.FIPS mode

If you install your cluster in xref:../../installing/installing-fips.adoc#installing-fips-mode_installing-fips[FIPS mode], no additional setup is required for {VirtProductName}.

.Additional resources

* xref:../../architecture/architecture-rhcos.adoc#rhcos-about_architecture-rhcos[About RHCOS]

[id="object-maximums_{context}"]
== Object maximums

You must consider the following tested object maximums when planning your cluster:

* xref:../../scalability_and_performance/planning-your-environment-according-to-object-maximums.html#planning-your-environment-according-to-object-maximums[{product-title} object maximums]
* link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6571671[{VirtProductName} object maximums]

[id="restricted-networks-environments_{context}"]
== Restricted network environments

If you install {VirtProductName} in a restricted environment with no internet connectivity, you must xref:../../operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.adoc#olm-restricted-networks[configure Operator Lifecycle Manager for restricted networks].

If you have limited internet connectivity, you can xref:../../operators/admin/olm-configuring-proxy-support.adoc#olm-configuring-proxy-support[configure proxy support in Operator Lifecycle Manager] to access the Red Hat-provided OperatorHub.

[id="live-migration_{context}"]
== Live migration

Live migration has the following requirements:

* Shared storage with `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) access mode
* Sufficient RAM and network bandwidth
* Appropriate CPUs with sufficent capacity on the worker nodes. If the CPUs have different capacities, live migration might be very slow or fail.

[id="snapshots-and-cloning_{context}"]
== Snapshots and cloning

See xref:../../virt/virtual_machines/virtual_disks/virt-features-for-storage.adoc#virt-features-for-storage[{VirtProductName} storage features] for snapshot and cloning requirements.

// The HA section actually belongs to OpenShift, not Virt
[id="cluster-high-availability-options_{context}"]
== Cluster high-availability options

You can configure one of the following high-availability (HA) options for your cluster:

* Automatic high availability for xref:../../installing/installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-overview.adoc#ipi-install-overview[installer-provisioned infrastructure] (IPI) is available by deploying xref:../../machine_management/deploying-machine-health-checks.adoc#machine-health-checks-about_deploying-machine-health-checks[machine health checks].
+
[NOTE]
====
In {product-title} clusters installed using installer-provisioned infrastructure and with MachineHealthCheck properly configured, if a node fails the MachineHealthCheck and becomes unavailable to the cluster, it is recycled. What happens next with VMs that ran on the failed node depends on a series of conditions. See xref:../../virt/virtual_machines/virt-create-vms.adoc#virt-about-runstrategies-vms_virt-create-vms[About RunStrategies for virtual machines] for more detailed information about the potential outcomes and how RunStrategies affect those outcomes.
====

* High availability for any platform is available by using either a monitoring system or a qualified human to monitor node availability. When a node is lost, shut it down and run `oc delete node <lost_node>`.
+
[NOTE]
====
Without an external monitoring system or a qualified human monitoring node health, virtual machines lose high availability.
