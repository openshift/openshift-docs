Before you install {VirtProductName}, ensure that your {product-title} cluster meets the following requirements:

* Your cluster must be installed on
xref:../../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.adoc#installing-bare-metal[bare metal] infrastructure with Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS workers.

* Additionally, your cluster must use xref:../../installing/installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-overview.adoc#ipi-install-overview[installer-provisioned infrastructure] and xref:../../machine_management/deploying-machine-health-checks.adoc#machine-health-checks-about_deploying-machine-health-checks[deploy machine health checks] to maintain high availability (HA) of virtual machines.

[NOTE]
====
In {VirtProductName} clusters installed using installer-provisioned infrastructure and with MachineHealthCheck properly configured, if a node fails the MachineHealthCheck and becomes unavailable to the cluster, it is recycled. What happens next with VMs that ran on the failed node depends on a series of conditions. See xref:../../virt/virtual_machines/virt-create-vms.adoc#virt-about-runstrategies-vms_virt-create-vms[About RunStrategies for virtual machines] for more detailed information about the potential outcomes and how RunStrategies affect those outcomes.
====

* You must manage your Compute nodes according to the number and size of the virtual machines that you want to host in the cluster.

{VirtProductName} works with {product-title} by default, but the following installation configurations are recommended:

* Configure xref:../../monitoring/understanding-the-monitoring-stack.adoc#understanding-the-monitoring-stack[monitoring] in the cluster.
