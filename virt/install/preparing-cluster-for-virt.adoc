= Configuring your cluster for {VirtProductName}
:context: preparing-cluster-for-virt

toc::[]

Before you install {VirtProductName}, ensure that your {product-title} cluster meets the following requirements:

* Your cluster must be installed on
xref:../../installing/installing_bare_metal/preparing-to-install-on-bare-metal.adoc#installing-bare-metal[on-premise bare metal] infrastructure with {op-system-first} workers. You can use any installation method including user-provisioned, installer-provisioned, or assisted installer to deploy your cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
{VirtProductName} only supports {op-system} worker nodes. RHEL 7 or RHEL 8 nodes are not supported.
====

* You can install {VirtProductName} on Amazon Web Services (AWS) bare metal instances. Bare metal instances offered by other cloud providers are not supported.

* Shared storage is required to enable live migration.

* You must manage your Compute nodes according to the number and size of the virtual machines that you want to host in the cluster.

* If you have limited internet connectivity, you can xref:../../operators/admin/olm-configuring-proxy-support.adoc#olm-configuring-proxy-support[configure proxy support in Operator Lifecycle Manager] to access the Red Hat-provided OperatorHub. If you are using a restricted network with no internet connectivity, you must xref:../../operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.adoc#olm-restricted-networks[configure Operator Lifecycle Manager for restricted networks].

* If your cluster uses worker nodes with different CPUs, live migration failures can occur because different CPUs have different capacities. To avoid such failures, use CPUs with appropriate capacity for each node and set node affinity on your virtual machines to ensure successful migration. See xref:../../nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-node-affinity.adoc#nodes-scheduler-node-affinity-configuring-required_nodes-scheduler-node-affinity[Configuring a required node affinity rule] for more information.

* All CPUs must be supported by Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and meet the following requirements:

** Intel 64 or AMD64 CPU extensions are supported
** Intel VT or AMD-V hardware virtualization extensions are enabled
** The no-execute (NX) flag is enabled

* If FIPS mode is xref:../../installing/installing-fips.adoc#installing-fips[enabled for your cluster], no additional setup is needed for {VirtProductName}. Support for FIPS cryptography must be enabled before the operating system that your cluster uses boots for the first time.

{VirtProductName} works with {product-title} by default, but the following installation configurations are recommended:

* Configure xref:../../monitoring/monitoring-overview.adoc#monitoring-overview[monitoring] in the cluster.

== How to maintain high availability of virtual machines

There are three options to maintain high availability (HA) of virtual machines:

* Automatic high availability for xref:../../installing/installing_bare_metal_ipi/ipi-install-overview.adoc#ipi-install-overview[installer-provisioned infrastructure] (IPI) is available by deploying xref:../../machine_management/deploying-machine-health-checks.adoc#machine-health-checks-about_deploying-machine-health-checks[machine health checks].
+
[NOTE]
====
In {VirtProductName} clusters installed using installer-provisioned infrastructure and with MachineHealthCheck properly configured, if a node fails the MachineHealthCheck and becomes unavailable to the cluster, it is recycled. What happens next with VMs that ran on the failed node depends on a series of conditions. See xref:../../virt/virtual_machines/virt-create-vms.adoc#virt-about-runstrategies-vms_virt-create-vms[About RunStrategies for virtual machines] for more detailed information about the potential outcomes and how RunStrategies affect those outcomes.
====


* Automatic high availability for both IPI and non-IPI is available by using the xref:../../nodes/nodes/eco-node-health-check-operator.adoc#node-health-check-operator[Node Health Check Operator] on any {product-title} cluster to deploy the `NodeHealthCheck` controller. The controller identifies unhealthy nodes and uses the Self Node Remediation Operator to remediate the unhealthy nodes.

--

* High availability for any platform is available by using either a monitoring system or a qualified human to monitor node availability. When a node is lost, shut it down and run `oc delete node <lost_node>`.
+
[NOTE]
====
Without an external monitoring system or a qualified human monitoring node health, virtual machines lose high availability.
