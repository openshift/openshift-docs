= Installing {VirtProductName} on {ibm-cloud-title} bare-metal nodes

:context: virt-install-ibm-cloud-bm-nodes

toc::[]

[role="_abstract"]
Install {VirtProductName} on {ibm-cloud-title} bare-metal nodes using Assisted Installer. The {VirtProductName} cluster in the {ibm-cloud-title} environment consists of 6 bare-metal nodes; 3 Master nodes and 3 Worker nodes. All nodes are connected to a private network. An additional virtual machine is required for bootstrapping operations and acting as a Samba server, DHCP server, network gateway, and load balancer. DNS Address records (A records) must be created for the cluster name and subdomains for external access.

Before performing the procedures in this section, ensuring you have the following items:

* An account in {ibm-cloud-title} with permissions to order and operate bare-metal nodes.
* An {ibm-cloud-title} SSL VPN user, to access the SuperMicro IPMI interface of a node.
