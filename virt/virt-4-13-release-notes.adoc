== Making open source more inclusive

Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language[our CTO Chris Wright's message].


== About Red Hat {VirtProductName}

Red Hat {VirtProductName} enables you to bring traditional virtual machines (VMs) into {product-title} where they run alongside containers, and are managed as native Kubernetes objects.

{VirtProductName} is represented by the image:virt-icon.png[{VirtProductName},40,40] icon.

You can use {VirtProductName} with either the xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/about-ovn-kubernetes.adoc#about-ovn-kubernetes[OVN-Kubernetes] or the xref:../networking/openshift_sdn/about-openshift-sdn.adoc#about-openshift-sdn[OpenShiftSDN] default Container Network Interface (CNI) network provider.

[id="virt-4-13-bug-fixes"]
== Bug fixes





[id="virt-4-13-known-issues"]
== Known issues

* You cannot run {VirtProductName} on a single-stack IPv6 cluster. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2193267[*BZ#2193267*])

* When you use two pods with different SELinux contexts, VMs with the `ocs-storagecluster-cephfs` storage class fail to migrate and the VM status changes to `Paused`. This is because both pods try to access the shared `ReadWriteMany` CephFS volume at the same time. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2092271[*BZ#2092271*])
** As a workaround, use the `ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd` storage class to live migrate VMs on a cluster that uses Red Hat Ceph Storage.

//Leave in per Dominik
* If you clone more than 100 VMs using the `csi-clone` cloning strategy, then the Ceph CSI might not purge the clones. Manually deleting the clones can also fail. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2055595[*BZ#2055595*])
** As a workaround, you can restart the `ceph-mgr` to purge the VM clones.

//OCPBUGS-8398 for Dominik
* If you stop a node on a cluster and then use the Node Health Check Operator to bring the node back up, connectivity to Multus might be lost.

//OCPBUGS-11277 for Dominik
* The must-gather tool might not collect diagnostic information for a node that is in a `NotReady` state. 

// Fix targeted for 4.12.1
//NOTE: This BZ has a status of CLOSED ERRATA. Should it be included in the 4.13 notes?
* The `TopoLVM` provisioner name string has changed in {VirtProductName} 4.12. As a result, the automatic import of operating system images might fail with the following error message (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2158521[*BZ#2158521*]):
+
[source,terminal]
----
DataVolume.storage spec is missing accessMode and volumeMode, cannot get access mode from StorageProfile.
----
** As a workaround:
. Update the `claimPropertySets` array of the storage profile:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch storageprofile <storage_profile> --type=merge -p '{"spec": {"claimPropertySets": [{"accessModes": ["ReadWriteOnce"], "volumeMode": "Block"}, \
    {"accessModes": ["ReadWriteOnce"], "volumeMode": "Filesystem"}]}}'
----
. Delete the affected data volumes in the `openshift-virtualization-os-images` namespace. They are recreated with the access mode and volume mode from the updated storage profile.

// Fix targeted for 4.13
* When restoring a VM snapshot for storage whose binding mode is `WaitForFirstConsumer`, the restored PVCs remain in the `Pending` state and the restore operation does not progress.
** As a workaround, start the restored VM, stop it, and then start it again. The VM will be scheduled, the PVCs will be in the `Bound` state, and the restore operation will complete. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2149654[*BZ#2149654*])

//New known issues for 4.13 go above this comment
//Leave in per Stu
* VMs created from common templates on a Single Node OpenShift (SNO) cluster display a `VMCannotBeEvicted` alert because the template's default eviction strategy is `LiveMigrate`. You can ignore this alert or remove the alert by updating the VM's eviction strategy. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2092412[*BZ#2092412*])

//Leave in per Simone
* Uninstalling {VirtProductName} does not remove the `feature.node.kubevirt.io` node labels created by {VirtProductName}. You must remove the labels manually. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-22036[*CNV-22036*])


//Leave in per Kedar
* Windows 11 virtual machines do not boot on clusters running in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html-single/security_hardening/index#con_federal-information-processing-standard-fips_assembly_installing-the-system-in-fips-mode[FIPS mode]. Windows 11 requires a TPM (trusted platform module) device by default. However, the `swtpm` (software TPM emulator) package is incompatible with FIPS. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2089301[*BZ#2089301*])

//BZ-1885605
//Leave in per Petr
* If your {product-title} cluster uses OVN-Kubernetes as the default Container Network Interface (CNI) provider, you cannot attach a Linux bridge or bonding device to a host's default interface because of a change in the host network topology of OVN-Kubernetes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1885605[*BZ#1885605*])
** As a workaround, you can use a secondary network interface connected to your host, or switch to the OpenShift SDN default CNI provider.

//Pending for Kevin
* In some instances, multiple virtual machines can mount the same PVC in read-write mode, which might result in data corruption. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1992753[*BZ#1992753*])
** As a workaround, avoid using a single PVC in read-write mode with multiple VMs.

//Leave in per Stu
* The Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) prevents pod disruptions for migratable virtual machine images. If the PDB detects pod disruption, then `openshift-monitoring` sends a `PodDisruptionBudgetAtLimit` alert every 60 minutes for virtual machine images that use the `LiveMigrate` eviction strategy. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2026733[*BZ#2026733*])
** As a workaround, xref:../monitoring/managing-alerts.adoc#silencing-alerts_managing-alerts[silence alerts].

//Leave in per Stu
* {VirtProductName} links a service account token in use by a pod to that specific pod. {VirtProductName} implements a service account volume by creating a disk image that contains a token. If you migrate a VM, then the service account volume becomes invalid. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2037611[*BZ#2037611*])
** As a workaround, use user accounts rather than service accounts because user account tokens are not bound to a specific pod.

//CNV-26301/BZ2193267 Leave in per Kedar
* In a heterogeneous cluster with different compute nodes, virtual machines that have HyperV Reenlightenment enabled cannot be scheduled on nodes that do not support timestamp-counter scaling (TSC) or have the appropriate TSC frequency.(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2193267[*BZ#2193267*])
