== Making open source more inclusive

Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language[our CTO Chris Wright's message].


== About Red Hat {VirtProductName}

Red Hat {VirtProductName} enables you to bring traditional virtual machines (VMs) into {product-title} where they run alongside containers, and are managed as native Kubernetes objects.

{VirtProductName} is represented by the image:virt-icon.png[{VirtProductName},40,40] icon.

You can use {VirtProductName} with either the xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/about-ovn-kubernetes.adoc#about-ovn-kubernetes[OVN-Kubernetes] or the xref:../networking/openshift_sdn/about-openshift-sdn.adoc#about-openshift-sdn[OpenShiftSDN] default Container Network Interface (CNI) network provider.

[id="virt-4-13-bug-fixes"]
== Bug fixes





[id="virt-4-13-known-issues"]
== Known issues

* {VirtProductName} does not support single-stack IPv6 networking. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2193267[*BZ#2193267*])

* When you use two pods with different SELinux contexts, VMs with the `ocs-storagecluster-cephfs` storage class fail to migrate and the VM status changes to `Paused`. This is because both pods try to access the shared `ReadWriteMany` CephFS volume at the same time. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2092271[*BZ#2092271*])
** As a workaround, use the `ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd` storage class to live migrate VMs on a cluster that uses Red Hat Ceph Storage.

// Fix targeted for 4.12.1
* The `TopoLVM` provisioner name string has changed in {VirtProductName} 4.12. As a result, the automatic import of operating system images might fail with the following error message (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2158521[*BZ#2158521*]):
+
[source,terminal]
----
DataVolume.storage spec is missing accessMode and volumeMode, cannot get access mode from StorageProfile.
----
** As a workaround:
. Update the `claimPropertySets` array of the storage profile:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch storageprofile <storage_profile> --type=merge -p '{"spec": {"claimPropertySets": [{"accessModes": ["ReadWriteOnce"], "volumeMode": "Block"}, \
    {"accessModes": ["ReadWriteOnce"], "volumeMode": "Filesystem"}]}}'
----
. Delete the affected data volumes in the `openshift-virtualization-os-images` namespace. They are recreated with the access mode and volume mode from the updated storage profile.

// Fix targeted for 4.13
* When restoring a VM snapshot for storage whose binding mode is `WaitForFirstConsumer`, the restored PVCs remain in the `Pending` state and the restore operation does not progress.
** As a workaround, start the restored VM, stop it, and then start it again. The VM will be scheduled, the PVCs will be in the `Bound` state, and the restore operation will complete. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2149654[*BZ#2149654*])

//New known issues for 4.13 go above this comment
* VMs created from common templates on a Single Node OpenShift (SNO) cluster display a `VMCannotBeEvicted` alert because the template's default eviction strategy is `LiveMigrate`. You can ignore this alert or remove the alert by updating the VM's eviction strategy. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2092412[*BZ#2092412*])

* Uninstalling {VirtProductName} does not remove the `feature.node.kubevirt.io` node labels created by {VirtProductName}. You must remove the labels manually. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-22036[*CNV-22036*])

* Some persistent volume claim (PVC) annotations created by the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) can cause the virtual machine snapshot restore operation to hang indefinitely. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2070366[*BZ#2070366*])
** As a workaround, you can remove the annotations manually:
. Obtain the xref:../virt/virtual_machines/virtual_disks/virt-managing-vm-snapshots.adoc#vm-snapshot-controller-and-crds_virt-managing-vm-snapshots[VirtualMachineSnapshotContent] custom resource (CR) name from the `status.virtualMachineSnapshotContentName` value in the `VirtualMachineSnapshot` CR.
. Edit the `VirtualMachineSnapshotContent` CR and remove all lines that contain `k8s.io/cloneRequest`.
. If you did not specify a value for `spec.dataVolumeTemplates` in the `VirtualMachine` object, delete any `DataVolume` and `PersistentVolumeClaim` objects in this namespace where both of the following conditions are true:
+
.. The object's name begins with `restore-`.
.. The object is not referenced by virtual machines.
+
This step is optional if you specified a value for `spec.dataVolumeTemplates`.
. Repeat the xref:../virt/virtual_machines/virtual_disks/virt-managing-vm-snapshots.adoc#virt-restoring-vm-from-snapshot-cli_virt-managing-vm-snapshots[restore operation] with the updated `VirtualMachineSnapshot` CR.

* Windows 11 virtual machines do not boot on clusters running in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html-single/security_hardening/index#con_federal-information-processing-standard-fips_assembly_installing-the-system-in-fips-mode[FIPS mode]. Windows 11 requires a TPM (trusted platform module) device by default. However, the `swtpm` (software TPM emulator) package is incompatible with FIPS. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2089301[*BZ#2089301*])

//BZ-1885605
* If your {product-title} cluster uses OVN-Kubernetes as the default Container Network Interface (CNI) provider, you cannot attach a Linux bridge or bonding device to a host's default interface because of a change in the host network topology of OVN-Kubernetes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1885605[*BZ#1885605*])
** As a workaround, you can use a secondary network interface connected to your host, or switch to the OpenShift SDN default CNI provider.

* In some instances, multiple virtual machines can mount the same PVC in read-write mode, which might result in data corruption. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1992753[*BZ#1992753*])
** As a workaround, avoid using a single PVC in read-write mode with multiple VMs.

* The Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) prevents pod disruptions for migratable virtual machine images. If the PDB detects pod disruption, then `openshift-monitoring` sends a `PodDisruptionBudgetAtLimit` alert every 60 minutes for virtual machine images that use the `LiveMigrate` eviction strategy. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2026733[*BZ#2026733*])
** As a workaround, xref:../monitoring/managing-alerts.adoc#silencing-alerts_managing-alerts[silence alerts].

* {VirtProductName} links a service account token in use by a pod to that specific pod. {VirtProductName} implements a service account volume by creating a disk image that contains a token. If you migrate a VM, then the service account volume becomes invalid. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2037611[*BZ#2037611*])
** As a workaround, use user accounts rather than service accounts because user account tokens are not bound to a specific pod.

* If you clone more than 100 VMs using the `csi-clone` cloning strategy, then the Ceph CSI might not purge the clones. Manually deleting the clones can also fail. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2055595[*BZ#2055595*])
** As a workaround, you can restart the `ceph-mgr` to purge the VM clones.
