The `kubernetes-nmstate` operator enables users to configure network interfaces, DNS settings and routing on {product-title} cluster nodes.

Two object types drive the configuration:

- `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy`: This object defines the policy, which is the desired network configuration on cluster nodes.

- `NodeNetworkConfigurationEnactment`: This object is read-only and reflects the execution state of a policy on cluster nodes.

The `kubernetes-nmstate` operator can support multiple policies, but you **must** avoid inter-policy dependencies. For example, if you configure policies such that they must be applied in a specific order, the policies must be consolidated into a single policy.

The `kubernetes-nmstate` operator applies the policies via NetworkManager, so the configuration is persistent and will resume on reboot.

[WARNING]
====
Changing a policy when its deployment is still in progress might result in undefined behavior.
