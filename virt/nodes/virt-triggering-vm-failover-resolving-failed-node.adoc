toc::[]

If a node fails and link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7057929[node health checks] are not deployed on your cluster, virtual machines (VMs) with `runStrategy: Always` configured are not automatically relocated to healthy nodes.

[id="prerequisites_{context}"]
== Prerequisites

* A node where a virtual machine was running has the `NotReady` xref:../../nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-viewing.adoc#nodes-nodes-viewing-listing_nodes-nodes-viewing[condition].
* The virtual machine that was running on the failed node has `runStrategy` set to `Always`.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

[id="verifying-vm-failover_{context}"]
== Verifying virtual machine failover

After all resources are terminated on the unhealthy node, a new virtual machine instance (VMI) is automatically created on a healthy node for each relocated VM. To confirm that the VMI was created, view all VMIs by using the `oc` CLI.
