toc::[]

Virtual machine (VM) workloads run as unprivileged pods. So that VMs can use {VirtProductName} features, some pods are granted custom security policies that are not available to other pod owners:

* An extended `container_t` SELinux policy applies to `virt-launcher` pods.
* xref:../authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.adoc#security-context-constraints-about_configuring-internal-oauth[Security context constraints] (SCCs) are defined for the `kubevirt-controller` service account.
