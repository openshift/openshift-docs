toc::[]

You can prevent the inadvertent deletion of a virtual machine (VM) by enabling delete protection for the VM. You can also disable delete protection for the VM.

You enable or disable delete protection from either the command line or the VM's *VirtualMachine details* page in the {product-title} web console. The option is disabled by default.

You can also choose to remove availability of the delete protection option for any VMs in a cluster you administer. In this case, VMs with the feature already enabled retain the protection, while the option is unavailable for any newly created VMs.
