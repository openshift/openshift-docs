= Inserting CD-ROMs in virtual machines

:context: virt-inserting-cd-roms-in-virtual-machines

[role="_abstract"]
To attach a storage device to a virtual machine (VM) without rebooting the VM in {product-title}, you can configure a VM to use a virtual CD-ROM drive, and insert an ISO image in the drive.

This also makes it possible to install an operating system from a CD-ROM in the VM.

[IMPORTANT]
====
CD-ROMs are currently provided as a Technology Preview in {product-title}. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/?extIdCarryOver=true&sc_cid=RHCTG0180000371695[Technology Preview features - Scope of Support] in Red Hat Knowledgebase.
