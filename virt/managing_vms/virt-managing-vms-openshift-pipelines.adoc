link:https://docs.openshift.com/pipelines/latest/about/understanding-openshift-pipelines.html[{pipelines-title}] is a Kubernetes-native CI/CD framework that allows developers to design and run each step of the CI/CD pipeline in its own container.

By using {pipelines-shortname} tasks and the example pipeline, you can do the following:

* Create and manage virtual machines (VMs), persistent volume claims (PVCs), data volumes, and data sources.
* Run commands in VMs.
* Manipulate disk images with `libguestfs` tools.

The tasks are located in link:https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?repo=redhat-tekton-tasks&sort=relevance&page=1[the task catalog (ArtifactHub)].

The example Windows pipeline is located in link:https://artifacthub.io/packages/tekton-pipeline/redhat-pipelines/windows-efi-installer[the pipeline catalog (ArtifactHub)].

== Windows EFI installer pipeline

You can run the link:https://artifacthub.io/packages/tekton-pipeline/redhat-pipelines/windows-efi-installer[Windows EFI installer pipeline] by using the web console or CLI.

The Windows EFI installer pipeline installs Windows 10, Windows 11, or Windows Server 2022 into a new data volume from a Windows installation image (ISO file). A custom answer file is used to run the installation process.

[NOTE]
====
The Windows EFI installer pipeline uses a config map file with `sysprep` predefined by {product-title} and suitable for Microsoft ISO files. For ISO files pertaining to different Windows editions, it may be necessary to create a new config map file with a system-specific `sysprep` definition.
