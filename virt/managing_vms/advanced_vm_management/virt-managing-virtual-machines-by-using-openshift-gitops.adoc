= Managing virtual machines by using OpenShift GitOps

To automate and optimize virtual machine (VM) management in OpenShift Virtualization, you can use OpenShift GitOps.

With GitOps, you can set up VM deployments based on configuration files stored in a Git repository. This also makes it easier to automate, update, or replicate these configurations, as well to use version control for tracking their changes.

.Prerequisites

* You have a GitHub account. For instructions to set up an account, see link:https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github[Creating an account on GitHub].

* OpenShift Virtualuzation has been installed on your OpenShift cluster. For instructions, see xref:../../../virt/install/installing-virt.adoc#installing-virt[OpenShift Virtualization installation].

* The OpenShift GitOps operator has been installed on your OpenShift cluster. For instructions, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/gitops/1.15/installing_gitops/preparing-gitops-install.html[Installing GitOps].
