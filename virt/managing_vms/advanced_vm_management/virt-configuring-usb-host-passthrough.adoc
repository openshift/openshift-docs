As a cluster administrator, you can expose USB devices in a cluster, which makes the devices available for virtual machine (VM) owners to assign to VMs. Enabling this passthrough of USB devices allows a VM to connect to USB hardware that is attached to an {product-title} node, as if the hardware and the VM are physically connected.

To expose a USB device, first enable host passthrough and then configure the VM to use the USB device.
