toc::[]

Use multi-queue functionality to scale network throughput and performance on virtual machines (VMs) with multiple vCPUs.

By default, the `queueCount` value, which is derived from the domain XML, is determined by the number of vCPUs allocated to a VM. Network performance does not scale as the number of vCPUs increases. Additionally, because virtio-net has only one Tx and Rx queue, guests cannot transmit or retrieve packs in parallel.

[NOTE]
====
Enabling virtio-net multiqueue does not offer significant improvements when the number of vNICs in a guest instance is proportional to the number of vCPUs.

== Known limitations

* MSI vectors are still consumed if virtio-net multiqueue is enabled in the host but not enabled in the guest operating system by the administrator.
* Each virtio-net queue consumes 64 KiB of kernel memory for the vhost driver.
* Starting a VM with more than 16 CPUs results in no connectivity if `networkInterfaceMultiqueue` is set to 'true' (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-16107[CNV-16107]).
