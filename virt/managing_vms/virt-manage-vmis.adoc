toc::[]

If you have standalone virtual machine instances (VMIs) that were created independently outside of the {VirtProductName} environment, you can manage them by using the web console or by using `oc` or xref:../../virt/getting_started/virt-using-the-cli-tools.adoc#virt-using-the-cli-tools[`virtctl`] commands from the command-line interface (CLI).

The `virtctl` command provides more virtualization options than the `oc` command. For example, you can use `virtctl` to pause a VM or expose a port.
