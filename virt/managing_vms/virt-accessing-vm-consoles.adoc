You can connect to the following consoles to access running virtual machines (VMs):

* xref:../../virt/managing_vms/virt-accessing-vm-consoles.adoc#serial-console_virt-accessing-vm-consoles[Serial console]

== Considerations for accessing VM consoles

In the {VirtProductName} environment, you can access guest VMs without the need for a guest network by using the {product-title} web console or by using `virtctl` commands from the command-line interface (CLI).

[NOTE]
====
Connecting to a guest VM through the VNC or serial console does not provide a full set of access features and cannot replace the Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) access. However, these consoles are useful for troubleshooting, as they allow access even if the guest VM has no network.
====

* *Connecting to VMs using the VNC console*
+
You can connect to the VNC console of a VM by using the {product-title} web console, as documented in the first two steps in xref:../../virt/managing_vms/virt-accessing-vm-consoles.adoc#vnc-console_virt-accessing-vm-consoles[Connecting to the VNC console by using the web console].
+
Alternatively, you can use the `virtctl` command-line tool to connect to the VNC console of a running VM. The installation of the `virtctl` command line tool is documented in xref:../../virt/getting_started/virt-using-the-cli-tools.adoc#installing-virtctl_virt-using-the-cli-tools[Installing virtctl], and the usage is documented in xref:../../virt/managing_vms/virt-accessing-vm-consoles.adoc#vnc-console_virt-accessing-vm-consoles[Connecting to the VNC console by using virtctl].
+
Take into account the following considerations:

** Using the VNC console is recommended for troubleshooting VMs.
** Using the VNC console is not recommended for high-traffic applications, such as Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), because of the burden on the API server.
** The API server must be able to handle the traffic load.
** The clients must be able to access the API server.
** The clients must have access credentials for the cluster.
** The VNC connection is expected to disconnect during live migration of a VM to another node.
** Using the VNC console allows only a single connection per VM at a time.

* *Connecting to VMs using the serial console*
+
You can connect to the serial console of a virtual machine (VM) by using the {product-title} web console, as documented in xref:../../virt/managing_vms/virt-accessing-vm-consoles.adoc#serial-console_virt-accessing-vm-consoles[Connecting to the serial console by using the web console].
+
Alternatively, you can use the `virtctl` command-line tool to connect to the serial console of a running virtual machine. The installation of the `virtctl` command line tool is documented in xref:../../virt/getting_started/virt-using-the-cli-tools.adoc#installing-virtctl_virt-using-the-cli-tools[Installing virtctl], and the usage is documented in xref:../../virt/managing_vms/virt-accessing-vm-consoles.adoc#serial-console_virt-accessing-vm-consoles[Connecting to the serial console by using virtctl].

Take into account the following considerations:

** The clients must be able to access the API server.
** The clients must have access credentials for the cluster.
** The API server must be able to handle the traffic load.
** The serial connection is expected to disconnect during live migration of a VM to another node.
** Using the serial console allows only a single connection per VM at a time.

You can connect to the serial console of a virtual machine by using the {product-title} web console or the `virtctl` command-line tool.

[NOTE]
