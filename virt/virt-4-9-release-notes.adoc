[id="virt-4-9-inclusive-language"]
== Making open source more inclusive

Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language[our CTO Chris Wright's message].

[id="virt-4-9-new"]
== New and changed features
//CNV-8875 OLM and stable channels

//CNV-8577 OpenShift Service Mesh: Commenting out the RN because the feature will now be available in 4.10
////
* {VirtProductName} is now integrated with OpenShift Service Mesh. You can xref:../virt/virtual_machines/vm_networking/virt-connecting-vm-to-service-mesh.adoc#virt-connecting-vm-to-service-mesh[connect virtual machines to a service mesh] to monitor, visualize, and control traffic between pods that run virtual machine workloads on the default pod network with IPv4.
////

//CNV-12858
* {VirtProductName} is certified in Microsoft’s Windows Server Virtualization Validation Program (SVVP) to run Windows Server workloads.
+
The SVVP Certification applies to:
+
** Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS workers. In the Microsoft SVVP Catalog, they are named __Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 on RHEL CoreOS__.
** Intel and AMD CPUs.

//CNV-9540 High performance windows
* High-performance virtual machine templates are now available for xref:virt-guest-os[supported Windows operating systems].

//CNV-8875
* If your {VirtProductName} Operator subscription used any update channel other than *stable*, it is now automatically subscribed to the *stable* channel. This single update channel delivers z-stream and minor version updates and ensures that your {VirtProductName} and {product-title} versions are compatible.

//CNV-14246
* You can now use the `virtctl guestfs` command xref:../virt/virt-using-the-cli-tools.html#virt-creating-pvc-with-virtctl-guestfs_virt-using-the-cli-tools[to maintain, repair, and debug virtual machine disks].

//CNV-14262
* You can now xref:../virt/virtual_machines/advanced_vm_management/virt-efi-mode-for-vms.html#virt-booting-vms-efi-mode_virt-efi-mode-for-vms[boot virtual machines with EFI mode] without mandatory Secure Boot.

[id="virt-4-9-quick-starts"]
=== Quick starts

* Quick start tours are available for several {VirtProductName} features. To view the tours, click the *Help* icon *?* in the menu bar on the header of the {VirtProductName} console and then select *Quick Starts*. You can filter the available tours by entering the `virtualization` keyword in the *Filter* field.

[id="virt-4-9-installation-new"]
=== Installation

//CNV-14191 FIPS on CNV
* You can now deploy {VirtProductName} on xref:../installing/installing-fips.adoc#installing-fips[FIPS-enabled clusters].

* You can now download the xref:../virt/install/virt-enabling-virtctl.adoc#virt-enabling-virtctl[`virtctl` client] even if the cluster is offline by using the `ConsoleCLIDownload` custom resource (CR).

[id="virt-4-9-networking-new"]
=== Networking
//CNV-11197 MAC spoof filtering
* You can now xref:../virt/virtual_machines/vm_networking/virt-attaching-vm-multiple-networks.adoc#virt-creating-bridge-nad-cli_virt-attaching-multiple-networks[enable or disable MAC spoof filtering] on secondary networks by configuring a Linux bridge network attachment definition in the CLI.

[id="virt-4-9-storage-new"]
=== Storage

//CNV-14247 CSI Clones
* You can use storage profiles to set a default cloning method for a storage class, creating a xref:../virt/virtual_machines/virtual_disks/virt-creating-data-volumes.adoc#virt-customizing-storage-profile-default-cloning-strategy_virt-creating-data-volumes[cloning strategy]. Setting cloning strategies can be helpful, for example, if your storage vendor only supports certain cloning methods. It also allows you to select a method that limits resource usage or maximizes performance. In addition to previously available cloning methods such as snapshots and host-assisted cloning, you can now specify `csi-clone` as the default cloning behavior, which uses the CSI clone API to efficiently clone an existing volume without using an interim volume snapshot.

//CNV-14245 Online VM snapshots
* You can now take a xref:../virt/virtual_machines/virtual_disks/virt-managing-vm-snapshots.adoc#virt-about-vm-snapshots_virt-managing-vm-snapshots[snapshot of an online virtual machine]. If the QEMU guest agent is installed, the file system is quiesced when taking the snapshot, maximizing data integrity.
[id="virt-4-9-web-new"]

=== Web console

//BZ-1931579 Virt machine template descriptions
//CNV-14219 Sysprep UI
* You can now xref:../virt/virtual_machines/virt-create-vms.adoc#virt-creating-vm-wizard-web_virt-create-vms[automate your Windows virtual machine setup] by uploading answer files in XML format in the *Advanced* -> *SysPrep* section of the *Create virtual machine from template* wizard.

//CNV-11664 Rhel 9 OCP Virt

//CNV-14193 Virt dashboard
* You can use the xref:../virt/logging_events_monitoring/virt-reviewing-vm-dashboard.adoc#virt-reviewing-vm-dashboard[{VirtProductName} dashboard] in the web console to get data on resource consumption for virtual machines and associated pods. The dashboard provides visual representations of cluster metrics so you can quickly understand the state of your cluster.

//CNV-14192 virt-launcher now automatically updates - now TP
* You can now enable automatic updates for {VirtProductName} workloads, such as `virt-launcher` pods. xref:../virt/upgrading-virt.adoc#configuring-workload-updates_upgrading-virt[Configure workload update strategies] by editing the `HyperConverged` custom resource.

* You can now xref:../virt/virtual_machines/virtual_disks/virt-hot-plugging-virtual-disks.adoc#virt-hot-plugging-virtual-disks[hot-plug and hot-unplug virtual disks] when you want to add or remove them from your virtual machine without stopping the virtual machine instance.

* You can now use the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Alpha template to create virtual machines.

* You can now link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6409731[deploy {VirtProductName} on AWS bare metal nodes].

[id="virt-4-9-bug-fixes"]
== Bug fixes

* The *Template provider* menu in the web console no longer offers "Red Hat Supported" as a template search filter, to avoid confusion with the "Red Hat Provided" filter.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1952737[*BZ#1952737*])

* The KubeVirt plugin now checks the API version available and uses the correct version, rather than defaulting to the v1 API version, which resulted in an API mismatch and prevented virtual machine creation.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1977037[*BZ#1977037*]), (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1979114[*BZ#1979114*])

* The {op-system-base-full} 6 template is no longer prioritized in the web console.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1978200[*BZ#1978200*])

* The {op-system-base-full} 6 template is no longer labeled as a community-provided template in the web console.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1978202[*BZ#1978202*])

* The web console can now retrieve more information from virtual machines, including time zone and number of active users.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1979190[*BZ#1979190*])

* Live migration between nodes with incompatible CPUs is now prevented on clusters containing nodes that are not configured identically. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1760028[*BZ#1760028*])

* If you initially deployed {VirtProductName} version 2.4.z or earlier, you can now upgrade to the latest version without using a workaround. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1986989[*BZ#1986989*])

* If you run {VirtProductName} 2.6.5 with  {product-title} 4.8 or later, you can now create a virtual machine from the *Customize* wizard. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1979116[*BZ#1979116*])

* RHV VM import no longer fails if the VM affinity policy is set to `Migratable` rather than `Pinned`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1977277[*BZ#1977277*])

* Selecting *Create* -> *With Import wizard* on the *Virtualization* page of the {VirtProductName} web console no longer results in an erroneous error message. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1974812[*BZ#1974812*])

[id="virt-4-9-known-issues"]
== Known issues

//BZ-2007397
* If you hot-plug a virtual disk and then force delete the `virt-launcher` pod, you might lose data. This is due to a race condition that can cause the VM disk's contents to be wiped from the persistent volume. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2007397[*BZ#2007397*])

// Review this for permanent doc home in 4.10
* Editing a virtual machine fails if the VM references a deleted template that was provided by {VirtProductName} before version 4.8. In {VirtProductName} 4.8 and later, deleted {VirtProductName}-provided templates are automatically recreated by the {VirtProductName} Operator.

* If a cloning operation is initiated before the source is available to be cloned, the operation stalls indefinitely. This is because the clone authorization expires before the cloning operation starts. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1855182[*BZ#1855182*])
+
** As a workaround, delete the `DataVolume` object that is requesting the clone. When the source is available, recreate the `DataVolume` object that you deleted so that the cloning operation can complete successfully.

* If your {product-title} cluster uses OVN-Kubernetes as the default Container Network Interface (CNI) provider, you cannot attach a Linux bridge or bonding to the default interface of a host because of a change in the host network topology of OVN-Kubernetes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1885605[*BZ#1885605*])

** As a workaround, you can use a secondary network interface connected to your host, or switch to the OpenShift SDN default CNI provider.

// Review this for permanent doc home in 4.10
* Running virtual machines that cannot be live migrated might block an {product-title} cluster upgrade. This includes virtual machines that use hostpath provisioner storage or SR-IOV network interfaces.

** As a workaround, you can reconfigure the virtual machines so that they can be powered off during a cluster upgrade. In the `spec` section of the virtual machine configuration file:
+
. Remove the `evictionStrategy: LiveMigrate` field. See xref:../virt/live_migration/virt-configuring-vmi-eviction-strategy.adoc#virt-configuring-vmi-eviction-strategy[Configuring virtual machine eviction strategy] for more information on how to configure eviction strategy.
. Set the `runStrategy` field to `Always`.

** As a workaround, set the default CPU model by running the following command:
+
[NOTE]
====
You must make this change before starting the virtual machines that support live migration.

----
<1> Replace `<cpu_model>` with the actual CPU model value. You can determine this value by running `oc describe node <node>` for all nodes and looking at the `cpu-model-<name>` labels. Select the CPU model that is present on all of your nodes.

* If you enter the wrong credentials for the RHV Manager while importing a RHV VM, the Manager might lock the admin user account because the `vm-import-operator` tries repeatedly to connect to the RHV API. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1887140[*BZ#1887140*])

* If you run {VirtProductName} 2.6.5 with {product-title} 4.8 or later, various issues occur. You can avoid these issues by upgrading {VirtProductName} to version 4.8 or later.
+
** In the web console, if you navigate to the *Virtualization* page and select *Create* -> *With YAML* the following error message is displayed:
