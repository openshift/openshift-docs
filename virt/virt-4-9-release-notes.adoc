== About Red Hat {VirtProductName}

Red Hat {VirtProductName} enables you to bring traditional virtual machines (VMs) into {product-title} where they run alongside containers, and are managed as native Kubernetes objects.

{VirtProductName} is represented by the image:Operator_Icon-OpenShift_Virtualization-5.png[{VirtProductName},40,40] logo.

You can use {VirtProductName} with either the xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/about-ovn-kubernetes.adoc#about-ovn-kubernetes[OVN-Kubernetes] or the xref:../networking/openshift_sdn/about-openshift-sdn.adoc#about-openshift-sdn[OpenShiftSDN] default Container Network Interface (CNI) network provider.

Learn more about xref:../virt/about-virt.adoc#about-virt[what you can do with {VirtProductName}].

[id="virt-4-9-inclusive-language"]
== Making open source more inclusive

Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language[our CTO Chris Wright's message].

[id="virt-4-9-new"]
== New and changed features
//CNV-8875 OLM and stable channels

//CNV-8577 OpenShift Service Mesh: Commenting out the RN because the feature will now be available in 4.10
////
* {VirtProductName} is now integrated with OpenShift Service Mesh. You can xref:../virt/virtual_machines/vm_networking/virt-connecting-vm-to-service-mesh.adoc#virt-connecting-vm-to-service-mesh[connect virtual machines to a service mesh] to monitor, visualize, and control traffic between pods that run virtual machine workloads on the default pod network with IPv4.
////

//CNV-12858
* {VirtProductName} is certified in Microsoftâ€™s Windows Server Virtualization Validation Program (SVVP) to run Windows Server workloads.
+
The SVVP Certification applies to:
+
** Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS workers. In the Microsoft SVVP Catalog, they are named __Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 on RHEL CoreOS__.
** Intel and AMD CPUs.

//CNV-9540 High performance windows
High-performance virtual machine templates are now available for xref:virt-guest-os[supported Windows operating systems].

//CNV-8875
* If your {VirtProductName} Operator subscription used any update channel other than *stable*, it is now automatically subscribed to the *stable* channel. This single update channel delivers z-stream and minor version updates and ensures that your {VirtProductName} and {product-title} versions are compatible.

//CNV-14246
* You can now use the `virtctl guestfs` command xref:../virt/virt-using-the-cli-tools.html#virt-creating-pvc-with-virtctl-guestfs_virt-using-the-cli-tools[to maintain, repair, and debug virtual machine disks].

//CNV-14262
* You can now xref:../virt/virtual_machines/advanced_vm_management/virt-efi-mode-for-vms.html#virt-booting-vms-efi-mode_virt-efi-mode-for-vms[boot virtual machines with EFI mode] without mandatory Secure Boot.

[id="virt-4-9-quick-starts"]
=== Quick starts

* Quick start tours are available for several {VirtProductName} features. To view the tours, click the *Help* icon *?* in the menu bar on the header of the {VirtProductName} console and then select *Quick Starts*. You can filter the available tours by entering the `virtualization` keyword in the *Filter* field.

[id="virt-4-9-deprecated"]
=== Deprecated features

Deprecated features are included in the current release and supported. However, they will be removed in a future release and are not recommended for new deployments.

//CNV-11468 Single VM import from RHV/VMware deprecated
* Importing a single virtual machine from Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) or VMware is deprecated in the current release and will be removed in {VirtProductName} 4.9. This feature is replaced by the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_virtualization[Migration Toolkit for Virtualization].

== Notable technical changes

[id="virt-4-9-technology-preview"]
== Technology Preview features

Some features in this release are currently in Technology Preview. These experimental features are not intended for production use. Note the following scope of support on the Red Hat Customer Portal for these features:

link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview Features Support Scope]

* You can now xref:../virt/virtual_machines/virtual_disks/virt-hot-plugging-virtual-disks.adoc#virt-hot-plugging-virtual-disks[hot-plug and hot-unplug virtual disks] when you want to add or remove them from your virtual machine without stopping the virtual machine instance.

[id="virt-4-9-known-issues"]
== Known issues

//New known issues should go below here.

//BZ-1963254 UEFI without Secure Boot

//New known issues should go above here.

* If a cloning operation is initiated before the source is available to be cloned, the operation stalls indefinitely. This is because the clone authorization expires before the cloning operation starts. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1855182[*BZ#1855182*])
+
** As a workaround, delete the `DataVolume` object that is requesting the clone. When the source is available, recreate the `DataVolume` object that you deleted so that the cloning operation can complete successfully.

* If your {product-title} cluster uses OVN-Kubernetes as the default Container Network Interface (CNI) provider, you cannot attach a Linux bridge or bonding to the default interface of a host because of a change in the host network topology of OVN-Kubernetes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1885605[*BZ#1885605*])

** As a workaround, you can use a secondary network interface connected to your host, or switch to the OpenShift SDN default CNI provider.

* If you enter the wrong credentials for the RHV Manager while importing a RHV VM, the Manager might lock the admin user account because the `vm-import-operator` tries repeatedly to connect to the RHV API. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1887140[*BZ#1887140*])
+
** To unlock the account, log in to the Manager and enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ovirt-aaa-jdbc-tool user unlock admin
----
