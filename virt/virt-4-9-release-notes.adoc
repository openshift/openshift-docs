== About Red Hat {VirtProductName}

Red Hat {VirtProductName} enables you to bring traditional virtual machines (VMs) into {product-title} where they run alongside containers, and are managed as native Kubernetes objects.

{VirtProductName} is represented by the image:Operator_Icon-OpenShift_Virtualization-5.png[{VirtProductName},40,40] logo.

You can use {VirtProductName} with either the xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/about-ovn-kubernetes.adoc#about-ovn-kubernetes[OVN-Kubernetes] or the xref:../networking/openshift_sdn/about-openshift-sdn.adoc#about-openshift-sdn[OpenShiftSDN] default Container Network Interface (CNI) network provider.

Learn more about xref:../virt/about-virt.adoc#about-virt[what you can do with {VirtProductName}].

[id="virt-4-9-inclusive-language"]
== Making open source more inclusive

Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language[our CTO Chris Wright's message].

[id="virt-4-9-new"]
== New and changed features
//CNV-8875 OLM and stable channels

//CNV-8577 OpenShift Service Mesh
* {VirtProductName} is now integrated with OpenShift Service Mesh. You can xref:../virt/virtual_machines/vm_networking/virt-connecting-vm-to-service-mesh.adoc#virt-connecting-vm-to-service-mesh[connect virtual machines to a service mesh] to monitor, visualize, and control traffic between pods that run virtual machine workloads on the default pod network with IPv4.

//CNV-12858 SVVP previous 8914

//CNV-9540 High performance windows

//CNV-8875
* If your {VirtProductName} Operator subscription used any update channel other than *stable*, it is now automatically subscribed to the *stable* channel. This single update channel delivers z-stream and minor version updates and ensures that your {VirtProductName} and {product-title} versions are compatible.

[id="virt-4-9-quick-starts"]
=== Quick starts

* Quick start tours are available for several {VirtProductName} features. To view the tours, click the *Help* icon *?* in the menu bar on the header of the {VirtProductName} console and then select *Quick Starts*. You can filter the available tours by entering the `virtualization` keyword in the *Filter* field.

[id="virt-4-9-deprecated-removed"]
== Deprecated and removed features

[id="virt-4-9-deprecated"]
=== Deprecated features

Deprecated features are included in the current release and supported. However, they will be removed in a future release and are not recommended for new deployments.

//CNV-11468 Single VM import from RHV/VMware deprecated
* Importing a single virtual machine from Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) or VMware is deprecated in the current release and will be removed in {VirtProductName} 4.9. This feature is replaced by the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_virtualization[Migration Toolkit for Virtualization].

[id="virt-4-9-changes"]
== Notable technical changes

[id="virt-4-9-technology-preview"]
== Technology Preview features

Some features in this release are currently in Technology Preview. These experimental features are not intended for production use. Note the following scope of support on the Red Hat Customer Portal for these features:

link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview Features Support Scope]

* You can now xref:../virt/virtual_machines/virtual_disks/virt-hot-plugging-virtual-disks.adoc#virt-hot-plugging-virtual-disks[hot-plug and hot-unplug virtual disks] when you want to add or remove them from your virtual machine without stopping the virtual machine instance.

[id="virt-4-9-known-issues"]
== Known issues

//New known issues should go below here.

//BZ-1963254 UEFI without Secure Boot

//New known issues should go above here.

* If a cloning operation is initiated before the source is available to be cloned, the operation stalls indefinitely. This is because the clone authorization expires before the cloning operation starts. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1855182[*BZ#1855182*])
+
** As a workaround, delete the `DataVolume` object that is requesting the clone. When the source is available, recreate the `DataVolume` object that you deleted so that the cloning operation can complete successfully.

* If your {product-title} cluster uses OVN-Kubernetes as the default Container Network Interface (CNI) provider, you cannot attach a Linux bridge or bonding to the default interface of a host because of a change in the host network topology of OVN-Kubernetes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1885605[*BZ#1885605*])

** As a workaround, you can use a secondary network interface connected to your host, or switch to the OpenShift SDN default CNI provider.

* Running virtual machines that cannot be live migrated might block an {product-title} cluster upgrade. This includes virtual machines that use hostpath-provisioner storage or SR-IOV network interfaces. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1858777[*BZ#1858777*])

** As a workaround, you can reconfigure the virtual machines so that they can be powered off during a cluster upgrade. In the `spec` section of the virtual machine configuration file:
+
. Remove the `evictionStrategy: LiveMigrate` field. See xref:../virt/live_migration/virt-configuring-vmi-eviction-strategy.adoc#virt-configuring-vmi-eviction-strategy[Configuring virtual machine eviction strategy] for more information on how to configure eviction strategy.
. Set the `runStrategy` field to `Always`.

* Live migration fails when nodes have different CPU models. Even in cases where nodes have the same physical CPU model, differences introduced by microcode updates have the same effect. This is because the default settings trigger host CPU passthrough behavior, which is incompatible with live migration. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1760028[*BZ#1760028*])

** As a workaround, set the default CPU model by running the following command:
+
[NOTE]
====
You must make this change before starting the virtual machines that support live migration.

<1> Replace `<cpu_model>` with the actual CPU model value. You can determine this value by running `oc describe node <node>` for all nodes and looking at the `cpu-model-<name>` labels. Select the CPU model that is present on all of your nodes.

* If you enter the wrong credentials for the RHV Manager while importing a RHV VM, the Manager might lock the admin user account because the `vm-import-operator` tries repeatedly to connect to the RHV API. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1887140[*BZ#1887140*])

// fix targeted for 4.8.1
* RHV VM import fails if the VM affinity policy is `Migratable` even when live migration is enabled in {VirtProductName}. VM import succeeds if the affinity policy is `Pinned`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1977277[*BZ#1977277*])

// fix targeted for 4.8.1
* Selecting *Create* -> *With Import wizard* on the *Virtualization* page of the {VirtProductName} console displays the following warning message:

----
Could not load VirtualMachines
No model registered for VirtualMachines
----

You can ignore this message. It does not affect VM import. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1974812[*BZ#1974812*])
