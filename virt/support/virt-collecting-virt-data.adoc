When you submit a xref:../../support/getting-support.adoc#support-submitting-a-case_getting-support[support case] to Red Hat Support, it is helpful to provide debugging information for {product-title} and {VirtProductName} by using the following tools:

must-gather tool::
The `must-gather` tool collects diagnostic information, including resource definitions and service logs.

Prometheus::
Prometheus is a time-series database and a rule evaluation engine for metrics. Prometheus sends alerts to Alertmanager for processing.

Alertmanager::
The Alertmanager service handles alerts received from Prometheus. The Alertmanager is also responsible for sending the alerts to external notification systems.

For information about the {product-title} monitoring stack, see xref:../../monitoring/monitoring-overview.adoc#about-openshift-monitoring[About {product-title} monitoring].

// This procedure is in the assembly so that we can add xrefs instead of a long list of additional resources.

== Collecting data about your environment

Collecting data about your environment minimizes the time required to analyze and determine the root cause.

.Prerequisites

* xref:../../monitoring/configuring-the-monitoring-stack.adoc#modifying-retention-time-for-prometheus-metrics-data_configuring-the-monitoring-stack[Set the retention time for Prometheus metrics data] to a minimum of seven days.
* xref:../../monitoring/managing-alerts.adoc#sending-notifications-to-external-systems_managing-alerts[Configure the Alertmanager to capture relevant alerts and to send alert notifications to a dedicated mailbox] so that they can be viewed and persisted outside the cluster.
* Record the exact number of affected nodes and virtual machines.

== Collecting data about virtual machines

Collecting data about malfunctioning virtual machines (VMs) minimizes the time required to analyze and determine the root cause.

.Prerequisites

* Linux VMs: xref:../../virt/virtual_machines/creating_vms_custom/virt-installing-qemu-guest-agent.adoc#virt-installing-qemu-guest-agent-on-linux-vm_virt-installing-qemu-guest-agent[Install the latest QEMU guest agent].
* Windows VMs:
** Record the Windows patch update details.
** link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6957701[Install the latest VirtIO drivers].
** xref:../../virt/virtual_machines/creating_vms_custom/virt-installing-qemu-guest-agent.adoc#virt-installing-virtio-drivers-existing-windows_virt-installing-qemu-guest-agent[Install the latest QEMU guest agent].
** If Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is enabled, connect by using the xref:../../virt/virtual_machines/virt-accessing-vm-consoles.adoc#desktop-viewer_virt-accessing-vm-consoles[desktop viewer] to determine whether there is a problem with the connection software.

.Procedure

. xref:../../virt/support/virt-collecting-virt-data.adoc#virt-must-gather-options_virt-collecting-virt-data[Collect must-gather data for the VMs] using the `/usr/bin/gather` script.
. Collect screenshots of VMs that have crashed _before_ you restart them.
. xref:../../virt/getting_started/virt-using-the-cli-tools.adoc#vm-memory-dump-commands_virt-using-the-cli-tools[Collect memory dumps from VMs] _before_ remediation attempts.
. Record factors that the malfunctioning VMs have in common. For example, the VMs have the same host or network.
