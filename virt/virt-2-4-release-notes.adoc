== About {VirtProductName} {VirtVersion}

include::modules/virt-what-you-can-do-with-virt.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

=== {VirtProductName} support

:FeatureName: {VirtProductName}
include::modules/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

== New and changed features

* Managing virtual machines is simpler and more efficient due to improvements
in design and workflow. You can now:
** Run the virtual machine wizard with less navigation. The wizard now uses
a comprehensive in-page style and includes a review page for confirming
configuration details before submission.
** Import a single VMware virtual machine with less navigation.
** Edit virtual machine templates as well as virtual machine configurations.
** Monitor health of virtual machine-backed services as you would for
Pod-based services.
** Enable persistent local storage for virtual machine images.
** Add, edit, and view virtual CD-ROM devices attached to a virtual machine.
** Add and view network attachment definitions with a graphical editor.

== Resolved issues

* Previously, when you added a disk to a virtual machine via the *Disks* tab in
the web console, the added disk had a `Filesystem` volumeMode regardless of the
volumeMode set in the `kubevirt-storage-class-default` ConfigMap. This issue has been fixed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1753688[*BZ#1753688*])

* Previously, when navigating to the *Virtual Machines Console* tab,
sometimes no content was displayed. This issue has been fixed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1753606[*BZ#1753606*])

* Previously, attempting to list all instances of the {VirtProductName} operator
from a browser resulted in a 404 (page not found) error.
This issue has been fixed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1757526[*BZ#1757526*])

* Previously, if a virtual machine used guaranteed CPUs, it was not scheduled
because the label `cpumanager=true` was not automatically set on nodes.
This issue has been fixed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1718944[*BZ#1718944*])

== Known issues

* If you have {VirtProductName} 2.1.0 deployed, you must first upgrade {VirtProductName}
to 2.2.0 before upgrading {product-title}. Upgrading {product-title} before upgrading
{VirtProductName} might trigger virtual machine deletion.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1785661[*BZ#1785661*])

// Don't remove: this BZ is probably true for all 2.x releases
* The `masquerade` binding method for virtual machines cannot be used in clusters with RHEL 7 compute nodes.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1741626[*BZ#1741626*])

* After migration, a virtual machine is assigned a new IP address. However, the
commands `oc get vmi` and `oc describe vmi` still generate output containing the
obsolete IP address. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1686208[*BZ#1686208*])
+
** As a workaround, view the correct IP address by running the following command:
+
----
$ oc get pod -o wide
----

* Some resources are improperly retained when removing {VirtProductName}. You
must manually remove these resources in order to reinstall {VirtProductName}.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1712429[*BZ#1712429*])

* Users without administrator privileges cannot add a network interface
to a project in an L2 network using the virtual machine wizard.
This issue is caused by missing permissions that allow users to load
network attachment definitions.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1743985[*BZ#1743985*])
+
** As a workaround, provide the user with permissions to load the network attachment
definitions.
+
. Define `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` objects to the YAML configuration
file, using the following examples:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
 name: cni-resources
rules:
- apiGroups: ["k8s.cni.cncf.io"]
 resources: ["*"]
 verbs: ["*"]
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: <role-binding-name>
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cni-resources
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: <user to grant the role to>
  namespace: <namespace of the user>
----
+
. As a `cluster-admin` user, run the following command to create the `ClusterRole`
and `ClusterRoleBinding` objects you defined:
+
----
$ oc create -f <filename>.yaml
----

* Live migration fails when nodes have different CPU models. Even in cases where
nodes have the same physical CPU model, differences introduced by microcode
updates have the same effect. This is because the default settings trigger
host CPU passthrough behavior, which is incompatible with live migration.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1760028[*BZ#1760028*])
+
** As a workaround, set the default CPU model in the `kubevirt-config` ConfigMap,
as shown in the following example:
+
[NOTE]
====
You must make this change before starting the virtual machines that support
live migration.
====
+
. Open the `kubevirt-config` ConfigMap for editing by running the following command:
+
----
$ oc edit configmap kubevirt-config -n openshift-cnv
----
+
. Edit the ConfigMap:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-config
data:
  default-cpu-model: "<cpu-model>" <1>
----
<1> Replace `<cpu-model>` with the actual CPU model value. You can determine this
value by running `oc describe node <node>` for all nodes and looking at the
`cpu-model-<name>` labels. Select the CPU model that is present on all of your
nodes.

* When running `virtctl image-upload` to upload large VM disk images in `qcow2`
format, an end-of-file (EOF) error may be reported after the data is
transmitted, even though the upload is either progressing normally or completed.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1789093[*BZ#1789093*])
+
Run the following command to check the status of an upload on a given PVC:
+
----
$ oc describe pvc <pvc-name> | grep cdi.kubevirt.io/storage.pod.phase
----

* When attempting to create and launch a virtual machine using a Haswell CPU,
the launch of the virtual machine can fail due to incorrectly labeled nodes.
This is a change in behavior from previous versions of {VirtProductName},
where virtual machines could be successfully launched on Haswell hosts.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1781497[*BZ#1781497*])
+
As a workaround, select a different CPU model, if possible.

* If you select a directory that shares space with your operating system,
you can potentially exhaust the space on the partition, causing the node to
be non-functional. Instead, create a separate partition
and point the hostpath provisioner to that partition so it will not
interfere with your operating system.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1793132[*BZ#1793132*])

* The {VirtProductName} upgrade process occasionally fails due to an interruption
from the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). This issue is caused by the limitations
associated with using a declarative API to track the state of {VirtProductName}
Operators. Enabling automatic updates during
xref:install/installing-virt.adoc#virt-subscribing-to-the-catalog_installing-virt[installation]
decreases the risk of encountering this issue.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1759612[*BZ#1759612*])

* {VirtProductName} cannot reliably identify node drains that are triggered by
running either `oc adm drain` or `kubectl drain`. Do not run these commands on
the nodes of any clusters where {VirtProductName} is deployed. The nodes might not
drain if there are virtual machines running on top of them.
The current solution is to put nodes into maintenance.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1707427[*BZ#1707427*])

* If you navigate to the *Subscription* tab on the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*
page and click the current upgrade channel to edit it, there might be no visible results.
If this occurs, there are no visible errors.
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1796410[*BZ#1796410*])
+
** As a workaround, trigger the upgrade process to {VirtProductName} {VirtVersion}
from the CLI by running the following `oc` patch command:
+
----
$ TARGET_NAMESPACE=openshift-cnv HCO_CHANNEL=2.2 oc patch -n "${TARGET_NAMESPACE}" $(oc get subscription -n ${TARGET_NAMESPACE} --no-headers -o name) --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/channel", "value":"${HCO_CHANNEL}"}, {"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/installPlanApproval", "value":"Automatic"}]'
----
+
This command points your subscription to upgrade channel `2.2` and enables automatic updates.
