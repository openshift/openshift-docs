[role="_abstract"]
You can configure {ibm-name} Secure Execution virtual machines (VMs) on {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name}.

{ibm-name} Secure Execution for Linux is a s390x security technology that is introduced with {ibm-name} z15 and {ibm-linuxone-name} III. It protects data of workloads that run in a KVM guest from being inspected or modified by the server environment.

Hardware administrators, KVM administrators, and KVM code cannot access data in an {ibm-name} Secure Execution guest VM.
