You can create a virtual machine (VM) by using a supported method of your choice. Before you do so, it is important to verify that you have the appropriate environment in place.

When you create a VM, you can do so by using available, pre-defined resources provided by Red Hat. You also have the option of setting up your environment by configuring certain resources of your own, as would be the case, for example, if you want to create, upload, and boot to a base operating system image not included by default.

To verify that you have set up your environment as required, confirm that you have the following configurations in place:

* A CSI provider to provision disks
* A network for the VM and connection to the SDN
* If connecting to a VLAN, the network attachment definitions
* A base operating system image, if you do not plan to use one provided by Red Hat
