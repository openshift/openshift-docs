== About Red Hat {VirtProductName}

With Red Hat {VirtProductName}, you can bring traditional virtual machines (VMs) into {product-title} and run them alongside containers. In {VirtProductName}, VMs are native Kubernetes objects that you can manage by using the {product-title} web console or the command line.

{VirtProductName} is represented by the image:virt-icon.png[{VirtProductName},40,40] icon.

You can use {VirtProductName} the xref:../../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/about-ovn-kubernetes.adoc#about-ovn-kubernetes[OVN-Kubernetes] Container Network Interface (CNI) network provider.

==== Nodes
//CNV-38543 - 4.16 Still an issue
* Uninstalling {VirtProductName} does not remove the `feature.node.kubevirt.io` node labels created by {VirtProductName}. You must remove the labels manually. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-38543[*CNV-38543*])

//BZ 2151169
* In a heterogeneous cluster with different compute nodes, virtual machines that have HyperV reenlightenment enabled cannot be scheduled on nodes that do not support timestamp-counter scaling (TSC) or have the appropriate TSC frequency. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2151169[*BZ#2151169*])

[id="virt-4-18-ki-storage"]
==== Storage
//CNV-23501: 4.16 - Keep per Dominik Holler
* If you clone more than 100 VMs using the `csi-clone` cloning strategy, then the Ceph CSI might not purge the clones. Manually deleting the clones might also fail. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-23501[*CNV-23501*])
** As a workaround, you can restart the `ceph-mgr` to purge the VM clones.

[discrete]
[id="virt-4-18-ki-virtualization"]
==== Virtualization

//CNV-36448: 4.16 - Unresolved
* When adding a virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) device to a Windows VM, the BitLocker Drive Encryption system check passes even if the vTPM device is not persistent. This is because a vTPM device that is not persistent stores and recovers encryption keys using ephemeral storage for the lifetime of the `virt-launcher` pod. When the VM migrates or is shut down and restarts, the vTPM data is lost. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-36448[*CNV-36448*])

//CNV-33835: 4.16 - Unresolved
* {VirtProductName} links a service account token in use by a pod to that specific pod. {VirtProductName} implements a service account volume by creating a disk image that contains a token. If you migrate a VM, then the service account volume becomes invalid. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-33835[*CNV-33835*])
** As a workaround, use user accounts rather than service accounts because user account tokens are not bound to a specific pod.

[discrete]
[id="virt-4-16-ki-webconsole_{context}"]
==== Web console
//CNV-38594: 4.16 - Still an issue per Guohua
* When you create a persistent volume claim (PVC) by selecting *With Data upload form* from the *Create PersistentVolumeClaim* list in the web console, uploading data to the PVC by using the *Upload Data* field fails. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-37607[*CNV-37607*])
