[id="virt-4-15-deprecated-removed"]
== Deprecated and removed features


[id="virt-4-15-deprecated"]
=== Deprecated features
// NOTE: when uncommenting deprecated features list, change the Removed features header level below to ===

Deprecated features are included in the current release and supported. However, they will be removed in a future release and are not recommended for new deployments.

//CNV-26426 [DOCS] Release note: Deprecate TTO
* The `tekton-tasks-operator` is deprecated and Tekton tasks and example pipelines are now deployed by the `ssp-operator`.

//CNV-26316: Release note: Align tekton tasks with instancestypes
* The `copy-template`, `modify-vm-template`, and `create-vm-from-template` tasks are deprecated.

//CNV-29048 Release note: Metrics name changes
* Many OpenShift Virtualization metrics have changed or will change in a future version. These changes could affect your custom dashboards. See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7028805[OpenShift Virtualization 4.14 metric changes] for details. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2179660[*BZ#2179660*])

[id="virt-4-15-known-issues"]
== Known issues

[discrete]
[id="virt-4-15-ki-monitoring"]
==== Monitoring
//4.14 Leave in per Stu (fix deferring to 4.15)
* The Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) prevents pod disruptions for migratable virtual machine images. If the PDB detects pod disruption, then `openshift-monitoring` sends a `PodDisruptionBudgetAtLimit` alert every 60 minutes for virtual machine images that use the `LiveMigrate` eviction strategy. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2026733[*BZ#2026733*])
** As a workaround, xref:../../monitoring/managing-alerts.adoc#silencing-alerts_managing-alerts[silence alerts].

[discrete]
[id="virt-4-15-ki-networking"]
==== Networking
//CNV-10590 - This issue can be removed for 4.15 when CNV-13680 RN is added.
//BZ-1885605
//4.14 leave in per Miguel Duarte de Mora Barroso
* If your {product-title} cluster uses OVN-Kubernetes as the default Container Network Interface (CNI) provider, you cannot attach a Linux bridge or bonding device to a host's default interface because of a change in the host network topology of OVN-Kubernetes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1885605[*BZ#1885605*])
** As a workaround, you can use a secondary network interface connected to your host, or switch to the OpenShift SDN default CNI provider.

//CNV-33789: Cannot SSH into VM over NodePort and Console's FQDN when using OVNKubernetes networking
* You cannot SSH into a VM when using the `networkType: OVNKubernetes` option in your `install-config.yaml` file. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2165895[*BZ#2165895*])

//4.14 leave in per Dan K
* You cannot run {VirtProductName} on a single-stack IPv6 cluster. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2193267[*BZ#2193267*])

[discrete]
[id="virt-4-15-ki-nodes"]
==== Nodes
//4.14 Leave in per Simone
* Uninstalling {VirtProductName} does not remove the `feature.node.kubevirt.io` node labels created by {VirtProductName}. You must remove the labels manually. 
//(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-22036[*CNV-22036*])
//Commenting out the above link. The doc bug has a security level "Red Hat Employee". This is causing Travis build failure in the RN PR.

[discrete]
[id="virt-4-15-ki-storage"]
==== Storage
//4.14 Leave in per Adam
* In some instances, multiple virtual machines can mount the same PVC in read-write mode, which might result in data corruption. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1992753[*BZ#1992753*])
** As a workaround, avoid using a single PVC in read-write mode with multiple VMs.

//4.14 Leave in per Adam and Stu; will be doc'd in 4.15
* If you clone more than 100 VMs using the `csi-clone` cloning strategy, then the Ceph CSI might not purge the clones. Manually deleting the clones might also fail. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2055595[*BZ#2055595*])
** As a workaround, you can restart the `ceph-mgr` to purge the VM clones.

//CNV-34198 (BZ 2237287)
* If you use Portworx as your storage solution on AWS and create a VM disk image, the created image might be smaller than expected due to the filesystem overhead being accounted for twice. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2237287[*BZ#2237287*])
** As a workaround, you can manually expand the Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) to increase the available space after the initial provisioning process completes.

//BZ2216038 from Ying
* If you simultaneously clone more than 1000 VMs using the provided DataSources in the `openshift-virtualization-os-images` namespace, it is possible that not all of the VMs will move to a running state. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2216038[*BZ#2216038*])
** As a workaround, deploy VMs in smaller batches.

//BZ2247593 from Ying
* Live migration cannot be enabled for a virtual machine instance (VMI) after a hotplug volume has been added and removed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2055595[*BZ#2247593*])

[discrete]
[id="virt-4-15-ki-virtualization"]
==== Virtualization
//4.14 Leave in per Stu
* {VirtProductName} links a service account token in use by a pod to that specific pod. {VirtProductName} implements a service account volume by creating a disk image that contains a token. If you migrate a VM, then the service account volume becomes invalid. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2037611[*BZ#2037611*])
** As a workaround, use user accounts rather than service accounts because user account tokens are not bound to a specific pod.

// Leave in for 4.14 per Stu; remove from 4.15 RNs and move content to CNV docs, per Avital
* With the release of the link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:3722[RHSA-2023:3722] advisory, the TLS `Extended Master Secret` (EMS) extension (link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7627[RFC 7627]) is mandatory for TLS 1.2 connections on FIPS-enabled RHEL 9 systems. This is in accordance with FIPS-140-3 requirements. TLS 1.3 is not affected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2157951[*BZ#2157951*])
+
Legacy OpenSSL clients that do not support EMS or TLS 1.3 now cannot connect to FIPS servers running on RHEL 9. Similarly, RHEL 9 clients in FIPS mode cannot connect to servers that only support TLS 1.2 without EMS. This in practice means that these clients cannot connect to servers on RHEL 6, RHEL 7 and non-RHEL legacy operating systems. This is because the legacy 1.0.x versions of OpenSSL do not support EMS or TLS 1.3. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7018256[TLS Extension "Extended Master Secret" enforced with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2].

** As a workaround, upgrade legacy OpenSSL clients to a version that supports TLS 1.3 and configure {VirtProductName} to use TLS 1.3, with the `Modern` TLS security profile type, for FIPS mode.

[discrete]
[id="virt-4-15-ki-webconsole"]
==== Web console
//CNV-34771 from Ying
* If you upgrade {product-title} 4.13 to 4.14 without upgrading {VirtProductName}, the Virtualization pages of the web console crash. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=OCPBUGS-22853[*OCPBUGS-22853*])

** As a workaround, you must upgrade the {VirtProductName} Operator to 4.14 manually or set your subscription approval strategy to *Automatic*.
