== About Red Hat {VirtProductName}

With Red Hat {VirtProductName}, you can bring traditional virtual machines (VMs) into {product-title} and run them alongside containers. In {VirtProductName}, VMs are native Kubernetes objects that you can manage by using the {product-title} web console or the command line.

{VirtProductName} is represented by the image:virt-icon.png[{VirtProductName},40,40] icon.

You can use {VirtProductName} the xref:../../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/about-ovn-kubernetes.adoc#about-ovn-kubernetes[OVN-Kubernetes] Container Network Interface (CNI) network provider.

Learn more about xref:../../virt/about_virt/about-virt.adoc#about-virt[what you can do with {VirtProductName}].

* Support for s390x architecture is now generally available. You can use {VirtProductName} on an {product-title} cluster that has been deployed in one or more logical partitions (LPARs) on {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name} (s390x architecture) systems. For more information, see xref:../../virt/install/preparing-cluster-for-virt.adoc#ibm-z-linuxone-compatibility_preparing-cluster-for-virt[{ibm-z-title} and {ibm-linuxone-title} compatibility].

[id="virt-4-19-technology-preview_{context}"]
== Technology Preview features

Some features in this release are currently in Technology Preview. These experimental features are not intended for production use. Note the following scope of support on the Red Hat Customer Portal for these features:

link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview Features Support Scope]

//CNV-52857 and CNV-56324
* You can now xref:../../virt/vm_networking/virt-setting-interface-link-state.adoc#virt-setting-interface-link-state[manage the link state] of a primary or secondary virtual machine (VM) interface by using the {product-title} web console or the CLI.

//CNV-58005
* {VirtProductName} is now supported on link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-boost/overview[Azure Boost].

// CNV-58423
* The `DevKubeVirtRelieveAndMigrate` descheduler profile is xref:../../virt/managing_vms/advanced_vm_management/virt-enabling-descheduler-evictions.adoc#nodes-descheduler-profiles_virt-enabling-descheduler-evictions[now available]. This profile enhances the `LongLifecycle` profile by supporting load-aware descheduling, dynamic soft taints, and improved workload rebalancing.

//CNV-62829
* You can now deploy {VirtProductName} on IPv6 single-stack clusters. Support for IPv6 single-stack is limited to the OVN-Kubernetes localnet and Linux bridge Container Network Interface (CNI) plugins.

=== Networking
//CNV-38746
* When you update from {product-title} 4.12 to a newer minor version, VMs that use the `cnv-bridge` Container Network Interface (CNI) fail to live migrate. (link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7069807[])
** As a workaround, change the `spec.config.type` field in your `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` manifest from `cnv-bridge` to `bridge` before performing the update.

[id="virt-4-19-ki-nodes_{context}"]
==== Nodes
//CNV-38543 - 4.16 Still an issue
* Uninstalling {VirtProductName} does not remove the `feature.node.kubevirt.io` node labels created by {VirtProductName}. You must remove the labels manually. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-38543[*CNV-38543*])

[discrete]
[id="virt-4-19-ki-storage_{context}"]
==== Storage
//CNV-23501: 4.16 - Keep per Dominik Holler
* If you clone more than 100 VMs using the `csi-clone` cloning strategy, the Ceph CSI might not purge the clones. Manually deleting the clones might also fail. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-23501[*CNV-23501*])
** As a workaround, you can restart the `ceph-mgr` daemon to purge the VM clones.

// CNV-55104: 4.18 - Unresolved
* If you perform storage class migration for a stopped VM, the VM might not be able to start because of a missing bootable device. To prevent this, do not attempt storage class migration if the VM is not running. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-55104[*CNV-55104*])

=== Virtualization

//CNV-48348
* When the mode of live migration is *PostCopy*, hot-plugging CPU or memory resource fails. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-48348[*CNV-48348*])

//CNV-33835: 4.16 - Unresolved
* {VirtProductName} links a service account token in use by a pod to that specific pod. {VirtProductName} implements a service account volume by creating a disk image that contains a token. If you migrate a VM, then the service account volume becomes invalid. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-33835[*CNV-33835*])
** As a workaround, use user accounts rather than service accounts because user account tokens are not bound to a specific pod.

:FeatureName: Using {VirtProductName} with s390x architecture
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]
--

// ocpbugs-51113 - ballooning call traces
* When you create a VM by using {op-system-base-full} container disk images for s390x architecture, call traces referencing `virtio_balloon` print to the VM console. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-51113[OCPBUGS-51113])
** As a workaround, add the following parameter to the VM YAML configuration: `spec.autoattachMemBalloon: false`.

// cnv-56889 - boot mode
* VMs based on s390x architecture can only use the *IPL* boot mode. However, in the {product-title} web console, the *Boot mode* list for s390x VMs incorrectly includes *BIOS*, *UEFI*, and *UEFI (secure)* boot modes. If you select one of these modes for an s390x-based VM, the operation fails. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-56889[CNV-56889])

// cnv-56890 - threads
* In the {product-title} web console, it is erroneously possible to define multiple CPU threads for a VM based on s390x architecture. If you define multiple CPU threads, the VM enters a `CrashLoopBackOff` state with the `qemu-kvm: S390 does not support more than 1 threads` error. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-56890[CNV-56890])
