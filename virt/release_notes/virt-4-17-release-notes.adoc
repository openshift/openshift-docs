== About Red Hat {VirtProductName}

With Red Hat {VirtProductName}, you can bring traditional virtual machines (VMs) into {product-title} and run them alongside containers. In {VirtProductName}, VMs are native Kubernetes objects that you can manage by using the {product-title} web console or the command line.

{VirtProductName} is represented by the image:virt-icon.png[{VirtProductName},40,40] icon.

You can use {VirtProductName} with either the xref:../../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/about-ovn-kubernetes.adoc#about-ovn-kubernetes[OVN-Kubernetes] or the xref:../../networking/openshift_sdn/about-openshift-sdn.adoc#about-openshift-sdn[OpenShiftSDN] default Container Network Interface (CNI) network provider.

[discrete]
[id="virt-4-17-ki-monitoring"]
==== Monitoring
//CNV-33834: 4.16 - Antonio Cardace said this is still an issue
* The Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) prevents pod disruptions for migratable virtual machine images. If the PDB detects pod disruption, then `openshift-monitoring` sends a `PodDisruptionBudgetAtLimit` alert every 60 minutes for virtual machine images that use the `LiveMigrate` eviction strategy. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-33834[*CNV-33834*])
** As a workaround, xref:../../observability/monitoring/managing-alerts.adoc#silencing-alerts_managing-alerts[silence alerts].

[id="virt-4-17-ki-networking"]
==== Networking


[discrete]
[id="virt-4-17-ki-nodes"]
==== Nodes
//CNV-38543 - 4.16 Still an issue
* Uninstalling {VirtProductName} does not remove the `feature.node.kubevirt.io` node labels created by {VirtProductName}. You must remove the labels manually. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-38543[*CNV-38543*])


[discrete]
[id="virt-4-17-ki-storage"]
==== Storage
//CNV-32695: 4.16 - Keep per Jenia Peimer
* If you use Portworx as your storage solution on AWS and create a VM disk image, the created image might be smaller than expected due to the filesystem overhead being accounted for twice. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-40217[*CNV-40217*])
** As a workaround, you can manually expand the persistent volume claim (PVC) to increase the available space after the initial provisioning process completes.

//CNV-13500: 4.16 - Keeping in until CNV-40857 is completed
* In some instances, multiple virtual machines can mount the same PVC in read-write mode, which might result in data corruption. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-13500[*CNV-13500*])
** As a workaround, avoid using a single PVC in read-write mode with multiple VMs.

//CNV-23501: 4.16 - Keep per Dominik Holler
* If you clone more than 100 VMs using the `csi-clone` cloning strategy, then the Ceph CSI might not purge the clones. Manually deleting the clones might also fail. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-23501[*CNV-23501*])
** As a workaround, you can restart the `ceph-mgr` to purge the VM clones.



[discrete]
[id="virt-4-17-ki-virtualization"]
==== Virtualization

//CNV-43195: 4.16 - VM migration fails with virError
* VM migrations might fail on clusters with mixed CPU types. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-43195[*CNV-43195*])
** As a workaround, you can set the CPU model at the xref:../../virt/virtual_machines/advanced_vm_management/virt-schedule-vms.adoc#virt-schedule-supported-cpu-model-vms_virt-schedule-vms[VM spec level] or at the xref:../../virt/virtual_machines/advanced_vm_management/virt-configuring-default-cpu-model.adoc#virt-configuring-default-cpu-model_virt-configuring-default-cpu-model[cluster level].

//CNV-36448: 4.16 - Unresolved
* When adding a virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) device to a Windows VM, the BitLocker Drive Encryption system check passes even if the vTPM device is not persistent. This is because a vTPM device that is not persistent stores and recovers encryption keys using ephemeral storage for the lifetime of the `virt-launcher` pod. When the VM migrates or is shut down and restarts, the vTPM data is lost. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-36448[*CNV-36448*])

//CNV-33835: 4.16 - Unresolved
* {VirtProductName} links a service account token in use by a pod to that specific pod. {VirtProductName} implements a service account volume by creating a disk image that contains a token. If you migrate a VM, then the service account volume becomes invalid. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-33835[*CNV-33835*])
** As a workaround, use user accounts rather than service accounts because user account tokens are not bound to a specific pod.

//CNV-NA: 4.16 - Keep this per Stu, ETA for fixing this issue is 4.18
* With the release of the link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:3722[RHSA-2023:3722] advisory, the TLS `Extended Master Secret` (EMS) extension (link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7627[RFC 7627]) is mandatory for TLS 1.2 connections on FIPS-enabled {op-system-base-full} 9 systems. This is in accordance with FIPS-140-3 requirements. TLS 1.3 is not affected.
+
Legacy OpenSSL clients that do not support EMS or TLS 1.3 now cannot connect to FIPS servers running on RHEL 9. Similarly, RHEL 9 clients in FIPS mode cannot connect to servers that only support TLS 1.2 without EMS. This in practice means that these clients cannot connect to servers on RHEL 6, RHEL 7 and non-RHEL legacy operating systems. This is because the legacy 1.0.x versions of OpenSSL do not support EMS or TLS 1.3. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7018256[TLS Extension "Extended Master Secret" enforced with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2].

** As a workaround, update legacy OpenSSL clients to a version that supports TLS 1.3 and configure {VirtProductName} to use TLS 1.3, with the `Modern` TLS security profile type, for FIPS mode.

[id="virt-4-16-ki-webconsole_{context}"]
==== Web console
//CNV-38293: 4.16 - Ronen Sde-Or said this was still an issue
* When you first deploy an {product-title} cluster, creating VMs from templates or instance types by using the web console, fails if you do not have `cluster-admin` permissions.
** As a workaround, the cluster administrator must first xref:../../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-configmaps.adoc#nodes-pods-configmap-create-from-console_configmaps[create a config map] to enable other users to use templates and instance types to create VMs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-38284[*CNV-38284*])

//CNV-38594: 4.16 known issue
* When you create a persistent volume claim (PVC) by selecting *With Data upload form* from the *Create PersistentVolumeClaim* list in the web console, uploading data to the PVC by using the *Upload Data* field fails. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-37607[*CNV-37607*])
