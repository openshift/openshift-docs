== About Red Hat {VirtProductName}

With Red Hat {VirtProductName}, you can bring traditional virtual machines (VMs) into {product-title} and run them alongside containers. In {VirtProductName}, VMs are native Kubernetes objects that you can manage by using the {product-title} web console or the command line.

{VirtProductName} is represented by the image:virt-icon.png[{VirtProductName},40,40] icon.

You can use {VirtProductName} the xref:../../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/about-ovn-kubernetes.adoc#about-ovn-kubernetes[OVN-Kubernetes] Container Network Interface (CNI) network provider.

link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview Features Support Scope]

//CNV-28944 Release note: Preview Cluster level eviction strategy change
* You can now configure a xref:../../virt/nodes/virt-node-maintenance.adoc#eviction-strategies[VM eviction strategy] for the xref:../../virt/nodes/virt-node-maintenance.adoc#virt-configuring-cluster-eviction-strategy-cli_virt-node-maintenance[entire cluster].

//CNV-15028: Nested virt in virt hosts. This feature will remain in tech preview indefinitely.

//CNV-22314: Safe memory overcommitment using `wasp-agent`
* Cluster admins can now use the `wasp-agent` tool to xref:../../virt/virtual_machines/virt-configuring-higher-vm-workload-density.adoc#virt-configuring-higher-vm-workload-density[configure a higher VM workload density] in their clusters by overcommitting the amount of memory, in RAM, and assigning swap resources to VM workloads.

[id="virt-4-17-ki-nodes"]
==== Nodes
//CNV-38543 - 4.16 Still an issue
* Uninstalling {VirtProductName} does not remove the `feature.node.kubevirt.io` node labels created by {VirtProductName}. You must remove the labels manually. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-38543[*CNV-38543*])

[id="virt-4-17-ki-storage"]
==== Storage
//CNV-23501: 4.16 - Keep per Dominik Holler
* If you clone more than 100 VMs using the `csi-clone` cloning strategy, then the Ceph CSI might not purge the clones. Manually deleting the clones might also fail. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-23501[*CNV-23501*])
** As a workaround, you can restart the `ceph-mgr` to purge the VM clones.

[id="virt-4-17-ki-virtualization"]
==== Virtualization

//CNV-43195: 4.16 - VM migration fails with virError
* VM migrations might fail on clusters with mixed CPU types. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-43195[*CNV-43195*])
** As a workaround, you can set the CPU model at the xref:../../virt/virtual_machines/advanced_vm_management/virt-schedule-vms.adoc#virt-schedule-supported-cpu-model-vms_virt-schedule-vms[VM spec level] or at the xref:../../virt/virtual_machines/advanced_vm_management/virt-configuring-default-cpu-model.adoc#virt-configuring-default-cpu-model_virt-configuring-default-cpu-model[cluster level].

//CNV-36448: 4.16 - Unresolved
* When adding a virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) device to a Windows VM, the BitLocker Drive Encryption system check passes even if the vTPM device is not persistent. This is because a vTPM device that is not persistent stores and recovers encryption keys using ephemeral storage for the lifetime of the `virt-launcher` pod. When the VM migrates or is shut down and restarts, the vTPM data is lost. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-36448[*CNV-36448*])

//CNV-33835: 4.16 - Unresolved
* {VirtProductName} links a service account token in use by a pod to that specific pod. {VirtProductName} implements a service account volume by creating a disk image that contains a token. If you migrate a VM, then the service account volume becomes invalid. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-33835[*CNV-33835*])
** As a workaround, use user accounts rather than service accounts because user account tokens are not bound to a specific pod.

==== Web console
//CNV-38594: 4.16 - Still an issue per Guohua
* When you create a persistent volume claim (PVC) by selecting *With Data upload form* from the *Create PersistentVolumeClaim* list in the web console, uploading data to the PVC by using the *Upload Data* field fails. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNV-37607[*CNV-37607*])
