== Making open source more inclusive

Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language[our CTO Chris Wright's message].

[id="virt-4-12-deprecated"]
=== Deprecated features
// NOTE: when uncommenting deprecated features list, change the header level below to ===

Deprecated features are included in the current release and supported. However, they will be removed in a future release and are not recommended for new deployments.

* In a future release, support for the legacy HPP custom resource, and the associated storage class, will be deprecated. Beginning in {VirtProductName} {VirtVersion}, the HPP Operator uses the Kubernetes Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver to configure local storage. The Operator continues to support the existing (legacy) format of the HPP custom resource and the associated storage class. If you use the HPP Operator, plan to xref:../virt/virtual_machines/virtual_disks/virt-configuring-local-storage-for-vms.adoc#virt-configuring-local-storage-for-vms[create a storage class for the CSI driver] as part of your migration strategy.

<<<<<<< HEAD
//CNV-20963
* You can now use Microsoft Windows 11 as a guest operating system. However, {VirtProductName} {VirtVersion} does not support USB disks, which are required for a critical function of BitLocker recovery. To protect recovery keys, use other methods described in the link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-recovery-guide-plan[BitLocker recovery guide].
=======
* You can now use the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Alpha template to create virtual machines.
>>>>>>> 08366e3b0f (rn update Jira query)

* You can now link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6409731[deploy {VirtProductName} on AWS bare metal nodes].

* {VirtProductName} has xref:../virt/logging_events_monitoring/virt-virtualization-alerts.adoc#virt-virtualization-alerts[critical alerts] that inform you when a problem occurs that requires immediate attention. Now, each alert has a corresponding description of the problem, a reason for why the alert is occurring, a troubleshooting process to diagnose the source of the problem, and steps for resolving the alert.

* Administrators can now declaratively xref:../virt/virtual_machines/advanced_vm_management/virt-configuring-mediated-devices.adoc#virt-configuring-mediated-devices[create and expose mediated devices] such as virtual graphics processing units (vGPUs) by editing the `HyperConverged` CR. Virtual machine owners can then assign these devices to VMs.

//CNV-13660 Inherit static IP from a NIC attached to the bridge
* You can xref:../networking/k8s_nmstate/k8s-nmstate-updating-node-network-config.adoc#capturing-nic-static-ip_k8s-nmstate-updating-node-network-config[transfer the static IP configuration of the NIC attached to the bridge] by applying a single `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` manifest to the cluster.

//CNV-16639
* You can now install {VirtProductName} on IBM Cloud bare-metal servers. Bare-metal servers offered by other cloud providers are not supported.

//CNV-19603
* You can check your {VirtProductName} cluster for compliance issues by installing the xref:../security/compliance_operator/compliance-operator-understanding.adoc#understanding-compliance[Compliance Operator] and running a scan with the xref:../security/compliance_operator/compliance-operator-supported-profiles.adoc#compliance-operator-supported-profiles[`ocp4-moderate` and `ocp4-moderate-node` profiles].

//CNV-17453 Network latency check
* {VirtProductName} now includes a xref:../virt/logging_events_monitoring/virt-running-cluster-checkups.adoc#virt-running-cluster-checkups[diagnostic framework] to run predefined checkups that can be used for cluster maintenance and troubleshooting. You can run a predefined checkup to xref:../virt/logging_events_monitoring/virt-running-cluster-checkups.adoc#virt-measuring-latency-vm-secondary-network_virt-running-cluster-checkups[check network connectivity and latency] for virtual machines on a secondary network.

//CNV-19145 Support live migration policies
* You can create live migration policies with specific parameters, such as bandwidth usage, maximum number of parallel migrations, and timeout, and apply the policies to groups of virtual machines by using virtual machine and namespace labels.

//New known issues for 4.12 go above this comment

* Some persistent volume claim (PVC) annotations created by the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) can cause the virtual machine snapshot restore operation to hang indefinitely. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2070366[*BZ#2070366*])
** As a workaround, you can remove the annotations manually:
. Obtain the xref:../virt/virtual_machines/virtual_disks/virt-managing-vm-snapshots.adoc#virtual-machine-snapshot-controller-and-custom-resource-definitions-crds[VirtualMachineSnapshotContent] custom resource (CR) name from the `status.virtualMachineSnapshotContentName` value in the `VirtualMachineSnapshot` CR.
. Edit the `VirtualMachineSnapshotContent` CR and remove all lines that contain `k8s.io/cloneRequest`.
. If you did not specify a value for `spec.dataVolumeTemplates` in the `VirtualMachine` object, delete any `DataVolume` and `PersistentVolumeClaim` objects in this namespace where both of the following conditions are true:
+
.. The object's name begins with `restore-`.
.. The object is not referenced by virtual machines.
+
This step is optional if you specified a value for `spec.dataVolumeTemplates`.
. Repeat the xref:../virt/virtual_machines/virtual_disks/virt-managing-vm-snapshots.adoc#virt-restoring-vm-from-snapshot-cli_virt-managing-vm-snapshots[restore operation] with the updated `VirtualMachineSnapshot` CR.

* Windows 11 virtual machines do not boot on clusters running in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html-single/security_hardening/index#con_federal-information-processing-standard-fips_assembly_installing-the-system-in-fips-mode[FIPS mode]. Windows 11 requires a TPM (trusted platform module) device by default. However, the `swtpm` (software TPM emulator) package is incompatible with FIPS. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2089301[*BZ#2089301*])

* In a Single Node OpenShift (SNO) cluster, a `VMCannotBeEvicted` alert occurs on virtual machines that are created from common templates that have the eviction strategy set to `LiveMigrate`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2092412[*BZ#2092412*])

* The QEMU guest agent on a Fedora 35 virtual machine is blocked by SELinux and does not report data. Other Fedora versions might be affected. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2028762[*BZ#2028762*])
** As a workaround, disable SELinux on the virtual machine, run the QEMU guest agent commands, and then re-enable SELinux.

//BZ-1984442 - keep in RN until it has a permanent place in docs
* If a single node contains more than 50 images, pod scheduling might be imbalanced across nodes. This is because the list of images on a node is shortened to 50 by default. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1984442[*BZ#1984442*])
** As a workaround, you can disable the image limit by xref:../nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-managing.adoc#nodes-nodes-managing[editing the `KubeletConfig` object] and setting the value of `nodeStatusMaxImages` to `-1`.

//BZ-1885605
=======
* Previously, on a large cluster, the {VirtProductName} MAC pool manager would take too much time to boot and {VirtProductName} might not become ready. With this update, the pool initialization and startup latency is reduced. As a result, VMs can now be successfully defined. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2035344[*BZ#2035344*])

* If a Windows VM crashes or hangs during shutdown, you can now manually issue a force shutdown request to stop the VM. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2040766[*BZ#2040766*])

* The YAML examples in the VM wizard have now been updated to contain the latest upstream changes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2055492[*BZ#2055492*])

* The *Add Network Interface* button on the VM *Network Interfaces* tab is no longer disabled for non-privileged users. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2056420[*BZ#2056420*])

* A non-privileged user can now successfully add disks to a VM without getting a RBAC rule error. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2056421[*BZ#2056421*])

* The web console now successfully displays virtual machine templates that are deployed to a custom namespace. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2054650[*BZ#2054650*])

* Previously, updating a Single Node OpenShift (SNO) cluster failed if the `spec.evictionStrategy` field was set to `LiveMigrate` for a VMI. For live migration to succeed, the cluster must have more than one compute node. With this update, the `spec.evictionStrategy` field is removed from the virtual machine template in a SNO environment. As a result, cluster update is now successful. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2073880[*BZ#2073880*])

* If your {product-title} cluster uses OVN-Kubernetes as the default Container Network Interface (CNI) provider, you cannot attach a Linux bridge or bonding device to a host's default interface because of a change in the host network topology of OVN-Kubernetes. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1885605[*BZ#1885605*])
** As a workaround, you can use a secondary network interface connected to your host, or switch to the OpenShift SDN default CNI provider.

* If you use Red Hat Ceph Storage or Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation Storage, cloning more than 100 VMs at once might fail. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1989527[*BZ#1989527*])
** As a workaround, you can perform a host-assisted copy by setting `spec.cloneStrategy: copy` in the storage profile manifest. For example:

    volumeMode: Filesystem
  cloneStrategy: copy <1>
status:
  provisioner: <provisioner>
  storageClass: <provisioner_class>
----
<1> The default cloning method set to `copy`.

* In some instances, multiple virtual machines can mount the same PVC in read-write mode, which might result in data corruption. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1992753[*BZ#1992753*])
** As a workaround, avoid using a single PVC in read-write mode with multiple VMs.

* The Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) prevents pod disruptions for migratable virtual machine images. If the PDB detects pod disruption, then `openshift-monitoring` sends a `PodDisruptionBudgetAtLimit` alert every 60 minutes for virtual machine images that use the `LiveMigrate` eviction strategy. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2026733[*BZ#2026733*])
** As a workaround, xref:../monitoring/managing-alerts.adoc#silencing-alerts_managing-alerts[silence alerts].

* {VirtProductName} links a service account token in use by a pod to that specific pod. {VirtProductName} implements a service account volume by creating a disk image that contains a token. If you migrate a VM, then the service account volume becomes invalid. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2037611[*BZ#2037611*])
** As a workaround, use user accounts rather than service accounts because user account tokens are not bound to a specific pod.

* If you configure the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR) to enable mediated devices before drivers are installed, the new device configuration does not take effect. This issue can be triggered by updates. For example, if `virt-handler` is updated before `daemonset`, which installs NVIDIA drivers, then nodes cannot provide virtual machine GPUs. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2046298[*BZ#2046298*])
** As a workaround:
. Remove `mediatedDevicesConfiguration` and `permittedHostDevices` from the `HyperConverged` CR.
. Update both `mediatedDevicesConfiguration` and `permittedHostDevices` stanzas with the configuration you want to use.

* If you clone more than 100 VMs using the `csi-clone` cloning strategy, then the Ceph CSI might not purge the clones. Manually deleting the clones can also fail. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2055595[*BZ#2055595*])
** As a workaround, you can restart the `ceph-mgr` to purge the VM clones.
