= Backing up virtual machines
:context: virt-backing-up-vms

toc::[]

You back up virtual machines (VMs) by creating an OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) xref:../../virt/backup_restore/virt-backing-up-vms.adoc#oadp-creating-backup-cr_virt-backing-up-vms[`Backup` custom resource (CR)].

The `Backup` CR performs the following actions:

* Backs up {VirtProductName} resources by creating an archive file on S3-compatible object storage, such as xref:../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-mcg.adoc#installing-oadp-mcg[Multicloud Object Gateway], Noobaa, or Minio.
* Backs up VM disks by using one of the following options:

** xref:../../virt/backup_restore/virt-backing-up-vms.adoc#oadp-backing-up-pvs-csi_virt-backing-up-vms[Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots] on CSI-enabled cloud storage, such as Ceph RBD or Ceph FS.
** xref:../../virt/backup_restore/virt-backing-up-vms.adoc#oadp-backing-up-applications-restic_virt-backing-up-vms[Restic file system backups] on object storage.

[NOTE]
====
OADP provides backup hooks to freeze the VM file system before the backup operation and unfreeze it when the backup is complete.

The `kubevirt-controller` creates the `virt-launcher` pods with annotations that enable Velero to run the `virt-freezer` binary before and after the backup operation.

The `freeze` and `unfreeze` APIs are subresources of the VM snapshot API. See xref:../../virt/virtual_machines/virtual_disks/virt-managing-vm-snapshots.adoc#virt-about-vm-snapshots_virt-managing-vm-snapshots[About virtual machine snapshots] for details.
====

You can add xref:../../virt/backup_restore/virt-backing-up-vms.adoc#oadp-creating-backup-hooks_virt-backing-up-vms[hooks] to the `Backup` CR to run commands on specific VMs before or after the backup operation.

You schedule a backup by creating a xref:../../virt/backup_restore/virt-backing-up-vms.adoc#oadp-scheduling-backups_virt-backing-up-vms[`Schedule` CR] instead of a `Backup` CR.
