You can connect a virtual machine (VM) to an OVN-Kubernetes localnet secondary network by using the CLI. Cluster administrators can use the `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` (CUDN) custom resource definition (CRD) to create a shared OVN-Kubernetes network across multiple namespaces.

An OVN-Kubernetes secondary network is compatible with the xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/secondary_networks/configuring-multi-network-policy.adoc#compatibility-with-multi-network-policy_configuring-additional-network[multi-network policy API] which provides the `MultiNetworkPolicy` custom resource definition (CRD) to control traffic flow to and from VMs. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must use the `ipBlock` attribute to define network policy ingress and egress rules for specific CIDR blocks. Using pod or namespace selector policy peers is not supported.
====

A localnet topology connects the secondary network to the physical underlay. This enables both east-west cluster traffic and access to services running outside the cluster, but it requires additional configuration of the underlying Open vSwitch (OVS) system on cluster nodes.
