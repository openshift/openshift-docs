toc::[]

You can connect a virtual machine (VM) to an Open Virtual Network (OVN)-Kubernetes secondary network. {VirtProductName} supports the layer 2 and localnet topologies for OVN-Kubernetes.

* A layer 2 topology connects workloads by a cluster-wide logical switch. The OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-in uses the Geneve (Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation) protocol to create an overlay network between nodes. You can use this overlay network to connect VMs on different nodes, without having to configure any additional physical networking infrastructure.

* A localnet topology connects the secondary network to the physical underlay. This enables both east-west cluster traffic and access to services running outside the cluster, but it requires additional configuration of the underlying Open vSwitch (OVS) system on cluster nodes.

[NOTE]
====
An OVN-Kubernetes secondary network is compatible with the xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/configuring-additional-network.adoc#compatibility-with-multi-network-policy_configuring-additional-network[multi-network policy API] which provides the `MultiNetworkPolicy` custom resource definition (CRD) to control traffic flow to and from VMs. You can use the `ipBlock` attribute to define network policy ingress and egress rules for specific CIDR blocks.

To configure an OVN-Kubernetes secondary network and attach a VM to that network, perform the following steps:

For localnet topology, you must xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/configuring-additional-network.adoc#configuring-additional-network_ovn-kubernetes-configuration-for-a-localnet-topology[configure an OVS bridge] by creating a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` object before creating the NAD.

== Creating an OVN-Kubernetes NAD

You can create an OVN-Kubernetes layer 2 or localnet network attachment definition (NAD) by using the {product-title} web console or the CLI.

[NOTE]
====
Configuring IP address management (IPAM) in a network attachment definition for virtual machines is not supported.
