You can connect a virtual machine (VM) to an Open Virtual Network (OVN)-Kubernetes secondary network. The OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-in uses the Geneve (Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation) protocol to create an overlay network between nodes.

{VirtProductName} currently supports the flat layer 2 topology. This topology connects workloads by a cluster-wide logical switch. You can use this overlay network to connect VMs on different nodes, without having to configure any additional physical networking infrastructure.

To configure an OVN-Kubernetes secondary network and attach a VM to that network, perform the following steps:

. Create a network attachment definition (NAD) by using the web console or the xref:../../virt/vm_networking/virt-connecting-vm-to-ovn-secondary-network.adoc#virt-creating-layer2-nad-cli_virt-connecting-vm-to-ovn-secondary-network[CLI].

. Add information about the secondary network interface to the VM specification by using the web console or the xref:../../virt/vm_networking/virt-connecting-vm-to-ovn-secondary-network.adoc#virt-attaching-vm-to-ovn-secondary-nw-cli_virt-connecting-vm-to-ovn-secondary-network[CLI].
