{VirtProductName} provides advanced networking functionality by using custom resources and plugins. Virtual machines (VMs) are integrated with {product-title} networking and its ecosystem.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot run {VirtProductName} on a single-stack IPv6 cluster.
====

The following figure illustrates the typical network setup of {VirtProductName}. Other configurations are also possible.

.{VirtProductName} networking overview
image::318_OpenShift_Virtualization_Networking_0423.png[{VirtProductName} networking architecture]

image:darkcircle-1.png[20,20] Pods and VMs run on the same network infrastructure which allows you to easily connect your containerized and virtualized workloads.

image:darkcircle-2.png[20,20] You can connect VMs to the default pod network and to any number of secondary networks.

image:darkcircle-3.png[20,20] The default pod network provides connectivity between all its members, service abstraction, IP management, micro segmentation, and other functionality.

image:darkcircle-4.png[20,20] Multus is a "meta" CNI plugin that enables a pod or virtual machine to connect to additional network interfaces by using other compatible CNI plugins.

image:darkcircle-5.png[20,20] The default pod network is overlay-based, tunneled through the underlying machine network.

image:darkcircle-6.png[20,20] The machine network can be defined over a selected set of network interface controllers (NICs).

image:darkcircle-7.png[20,20] Secondary VM networks are typically bridged directly to a physical network, with or without VLAN encapsulation. It is also possible to create virtual overlay networks for secondary networks.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Connecting VMs directly to the underlay network is not supported on {product-rosa}.
====

[NOTE]
====
Connecting VMs to user-defined networks with the `layer2` topology is recommended on public clouds.
====

image:darkcircle-8.png[20,20] Secondary VM networks can be defined on dedicated set of NICs, as shown in Figure 1, or they can use the machine network.

== Using the default pod network

xref:../../virt/vm_networking/virt-connecting-vm-to-default-pod-network.adoc#virt-connecting-vm-to-default-pod-network[Connecting a virtual machine to the default pod network]::

Each VM is connected by default to the default internal pod network. You can add or remove network interfaces by editing the VM specification.

[id="primary-udn-config"]
== Configuring a primary user-defined network

xref:../../virt/vm_networking/virt-connecting-vm-to-primary-udn.adoc#virt-connecting-vm-to-primary-udn[Connecting a virtual machine to a primary user-defined network]::

You can connect a virtual machine (VM) to a user-defined network (UDN) on the VM’s primary interface. The primary user-defined network replaces the default pod network to connect pods and VMs in selected namespaces. Cluster administrators can configure a primary `UserDefinedNetwork` CRD to create a tenant network that isolates the tenant namespace from other namespaces without requiring network policies. Additionally, cluster administrators can use the `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CRD to create a shared OVN `layer2` network across multiple namespaces.
+
User-defined networks with the `layer2` overlay topology are useful for VM workloads, and a good alternative to secondary networks in environments where physical network access is limited, such as the public cloud. The `layer2` topology enables seamless migration of VMs without the need for Network Address Translation (NAT), and also provides persistent IP addresses that are preserved between reboots and during live migration.

ifndef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa-hcp[]
You can connect a virtual machine to a secondary network by using Linux bridge, SR-IOV and OVN-Kubernetes CNI plugins. You can list multiple secondary networks and interfaces in the VM specification. It is not required to specify the primary pod network in the VM specification when connecting to a secondary network interface.
