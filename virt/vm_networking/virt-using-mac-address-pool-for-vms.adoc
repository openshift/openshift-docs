toc::[]

The _KubeMacPool_ component allocates MAC addresses for virtual machine (VM) network interfaces from a shared MAC address pool. This ensures that each network interface is assigned a unique MAC address.

Virtual machine instances created from that VM retain the assigned MAC address across reboots.

[NOTE]
====
KubeMacPool does not handle virtual machine instances created independently from a virtual machine.
