You can manage the link state of a primary or secondary virtual machine (VM) interface by using the {product-title} web console or the CLI. By specifying the link state, you can logically connect or disconnect the virtual network interface controller (vNIC) from a network.

[NOTE]
====
{VirtProductName} does not support link state management for Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) secondary network interfaces and their link states are not reported.
====

You can specify the desired link state when you first create a VM, by editing the configuration of an existing VM that is stopped or running, or when you hot plug a new network interface to a running VM. If you edit a running VM, you do not need to restart or migrate the VM for the changes to be applied. The current link state of a VM interface is reported in the `status.interfaces.linkState` field of the `VirtualMachineInstance` manifest.
