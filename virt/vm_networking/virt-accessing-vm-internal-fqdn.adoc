You can access a virtual machine (VM) that is connected to the default internal pod network on a stable fully qualified domain name (FQDN) by using headless services.

A Kubernetes _headless service_ is a form of service that does not allocate a cluster IP address to represent a set of pods. Instead of providing a single virtual IP address for the service, a headless service creates a DNS record for each pod associated with the service. You can expose a VM through its FQDN without having to expose a specific TCP or UDP port. 
 
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you created a VM by using the {product-title} web console, you can find its internal FQDN listed in the *Network* tile on the *Overview* tab of the *VirtualMachine details* page. For more information about connecting to the VM, see xref:../../virt/vm_networking/virt-accessing-vm-internal-fqdn.adoc#virt-connecting-vm-internal-fqdn_virt-accessing-vm-internal-fqdn[Connecting to a virtual machine by using its internal FQDN].
