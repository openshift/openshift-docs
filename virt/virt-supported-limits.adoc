You can refer to tested object maximums when planning your {product-title} environment for {VirtProductName}. However, approaching the maximum values can reduce performance and increase latency. Ensure that you plan for your specific use case and consider all factors that can impact cluster scaling.

For more information about cluster configuration and options that impact performance, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6994974[{VirtProductName} - Tuning & Scaling Guide] in the Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledgebase.
