Cluster administrators can add _catalogs_, or curated collections of Operators and Kubernetes extensions, to their clusters. Operator authors publish their products to these catalogs. When you add a catalog to your cluster, you have access to the versions, patches, and over-the-air updates of the Operators and extensions that are published to the catalog.

You can manage catalogs and extensions declaratively from the CLI by using custom resources (CRs).

_File-based catalogs_ are the latest iteration of the catalog format in Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). It is a plain text-based (JSON or YAML) and declarative config evolution of the earlier SQLite database format, and it is fully backwards compatible.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Kubernetes periodically deprecates certain APIs that are removed in subsequent releases. As a result, Operators are unable to use removed APIs starting with the version of {product-title} that uses the Kubernetes version that removed the API.

If your cluster is using custom catalogs, see xref:../../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-working-bundle-images.adoc#osdk-control-compat_osdk-working-bundle-images[Controlling Operator compatibility with {product-title} versions] for more details about how Operator authors can update their projects to help avoid workload issues and prevent incompatible upgrades.
