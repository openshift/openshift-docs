When you specify the cluster extension you want to install in a custom resource (CR), {olmv1-first} uses catalog selection to resolve what content is installed.

You can perform the following actions to control the selection of catalog content:

* Specify labels to select the catalog.
* Use match expressions to perform complex filtering across catalogs.
* Set catalog priority.

If you do not specify any catalog selection criteria, {olmv1-first} selects an extension from any available catalog on the cluster that provides the requested package.

During resolution, bundles that are not deprecated are preferred over deprecated bundles by default.
