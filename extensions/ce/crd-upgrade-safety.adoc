:FeatureName: {olmv1-first}
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

When you update a custom resource definition (CRD) that is provided by a cluster extension, {olmv1-first} runs a CRD upgrade safety preflight check to ensure backwards compatibility with previous versions of that CRD. The CRD update must pass the validation checks before the change is allowed to progress on a cluster.
