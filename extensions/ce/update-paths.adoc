When determining _update paths_, also known as upgrade edges or upgrade constraints, for an installed cluster extension, {olmv1-first} supports {olmv0} semantics starting in {product-title} 4.16. This support follows the behavior from {olmv0}, including `replaces`, `skips`, and `skipRange` directives, with a few noted differences.

By supporting {olmv0} semantics, {olmv1} accurately reflects the update graph from catalogs.

.Differences from original {olmv0} implementation

* If there are multiple possible successors, {olmv1} behavior differs in the following ways:
** In {olmv0}, the successor closest to the channel head is chosen.
** In {olmv1}, the successor with the highest semantic version (semver) is chosen.

* Consider the following set of file-based catalog (FBC) channel entries:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
- name: example.v3.0.0
  skips: ["example.v2.0.0"]
- name: example.v2.0.0
  skipRange: >=1.0.0 <2.0.0
----
+
If `1.0.0` is installed, {olmv1} behavior differs in the following ways:
+
--
** {olmv0-caps} will not detect an update path to `v2.0.0` because `v2.0.0` is skipped and not on the `replaces` chain.
** {olmv1} will detect the update path because {olmv1} does not have a concept of a `replaces` chain. {olmv1} finds all entries that have a `replace`, `skip`, or `skipRange` value that covers the currently installed version.
