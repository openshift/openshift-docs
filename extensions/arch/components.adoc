toc::[]

{olmv1-first} comprises the following component projects:

Operator Controller:: xref:../../extensions/arch/operator-controller.adoc#operator-controller[Operator Controller] is the central component of {olmv1} that extends Kubernetes with an API through which users can install and manage the lifecycle of Operators and extensions. It consumes information from catalogd.

Catalogd:: xref:../../extensions/arch/catalogd.adoc#catalogd[Catalogd] is a Kubernetes extension that unpacks file-based catalog (FBC) content packaged and shipped in container images for consumption by on-cluster clients. As a component of the {olmv1} microservices architecture, catalogd hosts metadata for Kubernetes extensions packaged by the authors of the extensions, and as a result helps users discover installable content.
