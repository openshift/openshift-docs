= Setting up an Argo CD instance
:context: setting-up-argocd-instance

toc::[]

By default, {gitops-title} installs an instance of Argo CD in the `openshift-gitops` namespace with additional permissions for managing certain cluster-scoped resources. This default Argo CD instance is also called as the default cluster-scoped instance.

[NOTE]
====
For {gitops-shortname} version 1.13 and later:

* Route TLS termination is set as default to the `reencrypt` mode for both the default and user-defined Argo CD instances. TLS connections to the Argo CD instances now receive the default ingress certificate that is set in {OCP}, instead of the self-signed Argo CD certificate. You can modify the route TLS termination policy by configuring the `.spec.server.route.tls` field of the Argo CD CR.

* Restricted pod security admission (PSA) labels are applied to the `openshift-gitops` namespace to ensure compliance with {OCP} standards. If you are running additional workloads in this namespace, such as monitoring or logging, ensure that they comply with the restricted PSA requirements. If compliance is not feasible, consider using a user-defined, cluster-scoped ArgoCD instance, where PSA labels are not applied or controlled by the {gitops-shortname} Operator.
====

To manage cluster configurations or deploy applications, you can install and deploy a new user-defined Argo CD instance. By default, any new user-defined instance has permissions to manage resources only in the namespace where it is deployed.
