Use the following section for instructions on accessing the registry.

You can access the registry directly to invoke `podman` commands. This allows
you to push images to or pull them from the integrated registry directly using
operations like `podman push` or `podman pull`. To do so, you must be logged in
to the registry using the `oc login` command. The operations you can perform
depend on your user permissions, as described in the following sections.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin[]
== Prerequisites

* You must have configured an identity provider (IDP).
* For pulling images, for example when using the `podman pull` command,
the user must have the `registry-viewer` role. To add this role:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user registry-viewer <user_name>
----

* For writing or pushing images, for example when using the `podman push` command,
the user must have the `registry-editor` role. To add this role:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user registry-editor <user_name>
----
