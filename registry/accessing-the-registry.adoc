Use the following sections for instructions on accessing the registry, including
viewing logs and metrics, as well as securing and exposing the registry.

You can access the registry directly to invoke `podman` commands. This allows
you to push images to or pull them from the integrated registry directly using
operations like `podman push` or `podman pull`. To do so, you must be logged in
to the registry using the `podman login` command. The operations you can perform
depend on your user permissions, as described in the following sections.

In {product-title}, Red Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) manages the registry for you. However, you can check the status of the registry pods and view the registry logs.

== Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You must have configured an identity provider (IDP).
* For pulling images, for example when using the `podman pull` command,
the user must have the `registry-viewer` role. To add this role, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user registry-viewer <user_name>
----

* For writing or pushing images, for example when using the `podman push` command:
** The user must have the `registry-editor` role. To add this role, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user registry-editor <user_name>
----
+
** Your cluster must have an existing project where the images can be pushed to.
