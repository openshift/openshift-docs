toc::[]

The Image Registry Operator installs a single instance of the {product-title}
registry, and it manages all configuration of the registry, including setting up
registry storage.

[NOTE]
====
Storage is only automatically configured when you install on Amazon Web Services.
====

After the control plane deploys, the Operator will create a default
`configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io` resource instance based on
configuration detected in the cluster.

If insufficient information is available to define a complete
`configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io` resource, the incomplete resource
will be defined and the operator will update the resource status with
information about what is missing.

The Image Registry Operator runs in the `openshift-image-registry` namespace,
and manages the registry instance in that location as well. All configuration
and workload resources for the registry reside in that namespace.
