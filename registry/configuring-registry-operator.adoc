== Image Registry on cloud platforms and OpenStack

The Image Registry Operator installs a single instance of the {product-title}
registry, and manages all registry configuration, including setting up
registry storage.

[NOTE]
====
Storage is only automatically configured when you install an
installer-provisioned infrastructure cluster on AWS, GCP, Azure, or OpenStack.

When you install or upgrade an installer-provisioned infrastructure cluster on AWS or Azure, the Image Registry Operator sets the `spec.storage.managementState` parameter to `Managed`. If the `spec.storage.managementState` parameter is set to `Unmanaged`, the Image Registry Operator takes no action related to storage.
====

After the control plane deploys, the Operator will create a default
`configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io` resource instance based on
configuration detected in the cluster.

If insufficient information is available to define a complete
`configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io` resource, the incomplete resource
will be defined and the Operator will update the resource status with
information about what is missing.

The Image Registry Operator runs in the `openshift-image-registry` namespace,
and manages the registry instance in that location as well. All configuration
and workload resources for the registry reside in that namespace.


[IMPORTANT]
====
The Image Registry Operator's behavior for managing the pruner is orthogonal to the `managementState` specified on the `ClusterOperator` object for the Image Registry Operator. If the Image Registry Operator is not in the `Managed` state, the image pruner can still be configured and managed by the `Pruning` custom resource.

However, the `managementState` of the Image Registry Operator alters the behavior of the deployed image pruner job:

* `Managed`: the `--prune-registry` flag for the image pruner is set to `true`.
* `Removed`: the `--prune-registry` flag for the image pruner is set to `false`, meaning it only prunes image metatdata in etcd.
* `Unmanaged`: the `--prune-registry` flag for the image pruner is set to `false`.
