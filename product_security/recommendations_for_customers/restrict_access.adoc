[[security-cluster-users-and-group-access]]
== Users and Group Access

and group access].

[[security-managing-RBAC]]
== Managing Role-based Access Control (RBAC)

Roles can be used to grant various levels of access both cluster-wide as well as
at the project-scope. Users and groups can be associated with, or bound to,
multiple roles at the same time. You can view details about the roles and their
bindings using the `oc describe` command.

how authorization is managed].

Managing Role-based Access Control (RBAC)].

[[security-dedicated-admin-role]]
=== Dedicated Administrator Role

As a dedicated administrator of an {product-title} cluster, your account has
increased permissions and access to all user-created projects. This role binds
you to the `dedicated-project-admin` for any new projects that are created by
users in the cluster. At the project level, an administrator of an
{product-title} cluster can perform all actions that a project administrator can
perform and, in addition, can set resource quotas and limit ranges for the
project. As the `dedicated-cluster-admin`, you can view but not manage cluster
roles. However, you can manage cluster role bindings and manage local roles and
bindings. At the cluster level, a `dedicated-admin` can:

* Manage users and groups.
* Manage roles and bindings.
* Manage authorization.
* View certain cluster-level resources  including events, nodes, persistent
volumes, and security context constraints.
* Create daemon sets, which ensure that nodes run a copy of a pod.

Users with the `admin` default cluster role bound locally can manage roles and
bindings for that project.

To view cluster roles as `dedicated-admin` for namespace `test1234`, run:

----
$ oc get clusterrolebinding.rbac -n test1234
----

To view local roles for the `test1234` namespace:

----
$ oc get rolebinding.rbac -n test1234
----

See
xref:../../getting_started/dedicated_administrators.adoc#getting-started-dedicated-administrators[Administering
an OpenShift Dedicated Cluster] for more information.

[[security-service-accounts]]
== Service Accounts

A xref:../../dev_guide/service_accounts.adoc#dev-guide-service-accounts[service
account] is a special user account that an application or service uses to
interact with the operating system. Services use the service accounts to log on
and make changes to the operating system or the configuration. Actions that the
service can perform are controlled with permissions. Every service account has
an associated user name that can be granted roles, just like a regular user. The
user name is derived from its project and name:

----
system:serviceaccount:<project>:<name>
----

To allow all service accounts in the `managers` project to edit resources in the
`test1234` project, run:

----
$ oc policy add-role-to-group edit system:serviceaccount:managers -n test1234
----

The system ensures that service accounts always have an API token and registry
credentials. The generated API token and registry credentials do not expire, but
they can be revoked by deleting the secret. When the secret is deleted, a new
one is automatically generated to take its place.

In addition to providing API credentials, a pod’s service account determines
which secrets the pod is allowed to use. Pods use secrets in two ways:

* Image pull secrets, providing credentials used to pull images for the pod’s
containers.
* Mountable secrets, injecting the contents of secrets into containers as files.

To allow a secret to be used as an image pull secret by a service account’s
pods, run:

----
$ oc secrets link --for=pull <serviceaccount-name> <secret-name>
----

To allow a secret to be mounted by a service account’s pods, run:

----
$ oc secrets link --for=mount <serviceaccount-name> <secret-name>
----

See
xref:../../admin_guide/service_accounts.adoc#admin-managing-service-accounts[Configuring
Service Accounts] for more information.

[[security-service-certificate-secrets-application-level-PKI]]
== Service Serving Certificate Secrets: Application-level Public Key Infrastructure

{product-title} features an application-level public key infrastructure (PKI).
This PKI manages certificates generated with the service serving certificate
secret feature. The Root CA files for this PKI are stored on master nodes under
`/etc/origin/master/service`.

Service serving certificate secrets are intended to support complex middleware
applications that need out-of-the-box certificates. To secure communication to
your service, have the cluster generate a signed serving certificate/key pair
into a secret in your namespace. The certificate and key are in Privacy-Enhanced
Mail (PEM) format, stored in `tls.crt` and `tls.key` respectively. The
certificate/key pair is automatically replaced when it gets close to expiration.
The signature algorithm for this feature is `x509.SHA256WithRSA`. To manually
rotate the certificate/key pair, delete the generated secret and a new
certificate will be created. See
xref:../../dev_guide/secrets.adoc#service-serving-certificate-secrets[Service
Serving Certificate Secrets] for more information.

[[dedicated-network-security-restricting-network-access]]
== Restricting Network Access

Traffic inbound to the cluster can be restricted at the platform level. If using
a VPN connection or a VPC peer, access to the cluster can be restricted so that
only internal traffic is accepted. Route-specific IP whitelisting can also be
implemented.

[[dedicated-network-security-routes]]
=== Routes

See the
xref:../../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-routes[Routes]
topic for an overview of routes, including route-specific annotations and IP
whitelisting.

[[dedicated-network-security-custom-domains]]
=== Custom Domains

To use custom domain names for your application routes, see
xref:../../getting_started/access_your_services.adoc#configuring-your-application-routes[Configure
your application routes]. When application owners choose to create custom
domains and associated routes, they must  manage the security certificates for
the domain. Red Hat provides certificates for application routes if custom
domains are not used as mentioned.

[[dedicated-network-security-ingress]]
=== Ingress

Ingress policies can be changed by using `NetworkPolicy` objects, which leverage
the `ovs-networkpolicy` plug-in. This allows for full control over ingress network
policy at the pod level, including between pods on the same cluster and even in
the same namespace. Additional load balancers can be purchased and configured
for services requiring Non-HTTP/SNI traffic or non-standard ports.

[[dedicated-network-security-egress]]
=== Egress

As an {product-title} cluster administrator, you can use the egress firewall
policy to limit the external addresses that some or all pods can access from
within the cluster. Pods can only communicate with internal hosts, and cannot
initiate connections to the public Internet or pods can communicate with the
Internet, but not to internal hosts. Public outbound traffic from the master and
infrastructure nodes is allowed and is necessary to maintain cluster image
security and cluster monitoring. See
xref:../../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#admin-guide-limit-pod-access-egress[Using
an Egress Firewall to Limit Access to External Resources] for more information

[[dedicated-network-security-egress]]
=== Enabling HTTP Strict Transport Security

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) policy is a security enhancement, which
ensures that only HTTPS traffic is allowed on the host. Any HTTP requests are
upgraded to HTTPS by default. This is useful for ensuring secure interactions
with websites for the user’s benefit. see
xref:../../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#admin-guide-enabling-hsts[Enabling
HTTP Strict Transport Security] for more information.
