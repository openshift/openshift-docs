Learn how to add custom trusted certificate authorities to {product-title}.

If you are using an enterprise certificate authority (CA) on your network, or self-signed certificates, you must add the CA's root certificate to {product-title} as a trusted root CA.

Adding trusted root CAs allows:

* Central and Scanner to trust remote servers when you integrate with other tools.
//TODO: Add link to integration topic
* Sensor to trust custom certificates you use for Central.

You can add additional CAs during the installation or on an existing deployment.

[NOTE]
====
You must first configure your trusted CAs in the cluster where you have deployed Central and then propagate the changes to Scanner and Sensor.

== Propagating changes

After you configure trusted CAs, you must make {product-title} services trust them.

* If you have configured trusted CAs after the installation, you must restart Central.
* Additionally, if you are also adding certificates for integrating with image registries, you must restart both Central and Scanner.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After you have added trusted CAs and configured Central, the CAs are included in any new Sensor deployment bundles that you create.

* If an existing Sensor reports problems while connecting to Central, you must generate a Sensor deployment YAML file and update existing clusters.
* If you are deploying a new Sensor using the `sensor.sh` script, run the following command before you run the `sensor.sh` script:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./ca-setup-sensor.sh -d ./additional-cas/
----
* If you are deploying a new Sensor using Helm, you do not have to run any additional scripts.
