Learn how to configure a retention period for {product-title} alerts.

With {product-title}, you can configure the time to keep historical alerts stored.
{product-title} then deletes the older alerts after the specified time.

By automatically deleting alerts that are no longer needed, you can save storage costs.

The alerts for which you can configure the retention period include:

* Runtime alerts, both unresolved (active) and resolved.
* Stale deploy-time alerts that do not apply to the current deployment.

[NOTE]
====
* Data retention settings are enabled by default. You can change these settings after the installation.
* When you upgrade {product-title}, data retention settings are not applied unless you have enabled them before.
* You can configure alert retention settings by using the RHACS portal or the API.
* The deletion process runs every hour.
Currently, you cannot change this.
