[role="_abstract"]
With {product-title}, you can enable some Prometheus metrics to be exposed on the `/metrics` path of the central API endpoint.

The available metric categories include:

* Image vulnerabilities;
* Node vulnerabilities;
* Policy violations;
* Total policy numbers;
* Cluster health;
* Certificate expiry.


Each category is configured with a data gathering period and a list of metrics. A metric is associated with a set of labels.

[NOTE]
====
The `/metrics` path is accessible for API tokens with Administration resource view permissions. The values of the labels are subject to Scoped Access Control.
====

The currently enabled metrics, if any, are shown on the *System Configuration* page of the *Platform Configuration* section of the {product-title} UI. In edit mode, the UI allows you to enable or disable one of the predefined metrics.

The `/v1/config` API allows for configuring metrics with custom metric names and a custom set of labels.
