[role="_abstract"]
With {product-title}, you can enable some Prometheus metrics to be exposed on the `/metrics` path of the central API endpoint.

The available metric categories include:

* Image vulnerabilities;
* Node vulnerabilities;
* Policy violations;
* Total policy numbers;
* Cluster health;
* Certificate expiry.


Each category is configured with a data gathering period and a list of metrics. A metric is associated with a set of labels.

[NOTE]
====
The `/metrics` path is accessible for API tokens with Administration resource view permissions. The values of the labels are subject to Scoped Access Control.
====

The currently enabled metrics, if any, are shown on the *System Configuration* page of the *Platform Configuration* section of the {product-title} UI. In edit mode, the UI allows you to enable or disable one of the predefined metrics.

The `/v1/config` API allows for configuring metrics with custom metric names and a custom set of labels.

Accepted image vulnerability labels:

* Cluster
* Namespace
* Deployment
* IsPlatformWorkload
* ImageID
* ImageRegistry
* ImageRemote
* ImageTag
* Component
* ComponentVersion
* OperatingSystem
* CVE
* CVSS
* Severity
* EPSSPercentile
* EPSSProbability
* IsFixable

Accepted node vulnerability labels:

* Cluster
* Node
* Kernel
* OperatingSystem
* OSImage
* Component
* ComponentVersion
* CVE
* CVSS
* Severity
* EPSSPercentile
* EPSSProbability
* IsFixable
* IsSnoozed

Accepted policy violation labels:

* Cluster
* Namespace
* Resource
* Deployment
* IsDeploymentActive
* IsPlatformComponent
* Policy
* Categories
* Severity
* Action
* Message
* Stage
* State
* Entity
* EntityName

The total policy numbers are exposed as `rox_central_cfg_total_policies` metric, and contains the following label:

* Enabled

The cluster health metric is exposed as `rox_central_health_cluster_info`, and contains the following labels:

* Cluster
* Type
* Status
* Upgradability

The certificate expiry metric is exposed as `rox_central_cert_exp_hours`, and contains the following label:

* Component

== Configuring User Workload monitoring

1. Create a permission set with Read Access to the following resources:

    * Administration
    * Alert
    * Cluster
    * Deployment
    * Image
    * Namespace
    * Node
    * WorkflowAdministration

2. Create a role with a desired access scope and the previously created permission set.
3. Add a role mapping to the Machine access Kubernetes service account configuration for key 'sub', value 'system:serviceaccount:openshift-monitoring:prometheus-k8s' and the role, created in the previous step.
4. Create the following ServiceMonitor resource in the namespace where the central is installed:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
    kind: ServiceMonitor
    metadata:
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/component: central
        monitoring.openshift.io/collection-profile: full
      name: central-custom-metrics
      namespace: stackrox
    spec:
      endpoints:
      - bearerTokenFile: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token
        path: /metrics
        port: https
        scheme: https
        tlsConfig:
          insecureSkipVerify: true
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app.kubernetes.io/component: central
    ```

5. Ensure the user-workload is enabled in the cluster. Otherwise create the following ConfigMap in the openshift-monitoring namespace:
    
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: cluster-monitoring-config
      namespace: openshift-monitoring
    data:
      config.yaml: 'enableUserWorkload: true'
    ```

After a few minutes the metrics should become available OpenShift Console -> Observe -> Metrics.
