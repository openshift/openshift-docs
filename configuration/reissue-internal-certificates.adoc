Each component of {product-title} uses an X.509 certificate to authenticate itself to other components.
These certificates have expiration dates, and you must reissue, or rotate, certificates before they expire.
You can view the certificate expiration dates by selecting *Platform Configuration* -> *Clusters* in the {product-title-short} portal and viewing the *Credential Expiration* column.

== Reissuing internal certificates for secured clusters
Secured clusters contain the Collector, Sensor, Admission Control, and local Scanner components.
These components communicate with each other, and with Central by using certificates.

Choose the appropriate method to reissue the internal certificates:

* Use the automatic certificate renewal feature. This is the recommended method for Operator and Helm deployments.
* Create, download, and install an init bundle on the secured cluster. You must have the `Admin` user role to create an init bundle. This method is only recommended for Operator and Helm deployments if the certificates have already expired and the secured cluster can no longer connect to Central.
* Use the automatic upgrades feature, which is only available for static manifest deployments by using the `roxctl` CLI. This method is only recommended if you have a specific installation requirement that necessitates the use of this method.
