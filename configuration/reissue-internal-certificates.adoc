Each component of {product-title} uses an X.509 certificate to authenticate itself to other components.
These certificates have expiration dates, and you must reissue them before they expire.
You can view the certificate expiry dates in the *Platform Configuration* -> *Clusters* view from the RHACS portal.

You can reissue internal certificates using one of the following methods:

* Use the automatic upgrade functionality #how to configure automatic upgrade of certs for Central and Scanner?#
* Generate a new init bundle and use it to create resources on the cluster
