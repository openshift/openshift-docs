[role="_abstract"]

Certificate authority (CA) rotation is important in {rh-rhacs-first} to ensure that Central and secured clusters can communicate.
{product-title-short} includes an internal CA that is valid for 5 years. Central and secured cluster service certificates depend on this CA. If the CA expires, {product-title-short} stops working.

Previously, if the internal CA expired, you had to delete the `central-tls` secret and manually re-register all the secured clusters. Starting with {product-title-short} 4.9, the Operator manages CA rotation. Central simultaneously trusts two CAs, enabling overlap and providing a smoother migration.
