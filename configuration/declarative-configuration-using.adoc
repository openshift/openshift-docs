With declarative configuration, you can update configurations by storing them in files in repositories and apply them to the system. Declarative configuration is useful, for example, if you are using a GitOps workflow. You can currently use declarative configuration in {rh-rhacs-first} for authentication and authorization resources such as authentication providers, roles, permission sets, and access scopes.

To use declarative configuration, you create YAML files that contain configuration information about authentication and authorization resources. These files, or configurations, are added to {product-title-short} by using a mount point during Central installation. See the installation documentation in the "Additional references" section for more information on configuring mount points when installing {product-title-short}.

The configuration files used with declarative configuration are stored in config maps or secrets, depending on the type of resource. Store configurations for authentication providers in a secret for greater security. You can store other configurations in config maps.

A single config map or secret can contain more than one configuration of multiple resource types. This allows you to limit the number of volume mounts for the Central instance.

== Restrictions for resources created from declarative configuration

Because resources can reference other resources (for example, a role can reference both a permission set and access scope), the following restrictions for references apply:

* A declarative configuration can only reference a resource that is either also created declaratively or a system {product-title-short} resource; for example, a resource such as the `Admin` or `Analyst` system role or permission set.
* All references between resources use names to identify the resource; therefore, all names within the same resource type must be unique.
* Resources created from declarative configuration can only be modified or deleted by altering the declarative configuration files. You cannot change these resources by using the {product-title-short} portal or the API.
