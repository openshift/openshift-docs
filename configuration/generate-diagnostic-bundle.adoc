You can generate a diagnostic bundle and send that data to enable the support team to provide insights into the status and health of {product-title} components.

Red Hat might request you to send the diagnostic bundle during investigation of your issues with {product-title}.
You can generate a diagnostic bundle and inspect its data before sending.

[NOTE]
====
The diagnostic bundle is unencrypted, and depending upon the number of clusters in your environment, the bundle size is between 100 KB and 1 MB.
Always use an encrypted channel to transfer this data back to Red Hat.
