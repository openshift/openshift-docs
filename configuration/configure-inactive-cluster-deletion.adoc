[role="_abstract"]
{rh-rhacscs-first} provides the option to configure your system to automatically remove nonactive clusters from {product-title-short} so that you can monitor active clusters only. Note that only clusters that were installed and performed a handshake with Central at least one time are monitored initially. If this feature is enabled, when Central has been unable to reach Sensor in a cluster for the period of time configured in the *Decomissioned cluster age* field, the cluster is considered nonactive in {product-title-short}. Central will then no longer monitor nonactive clusters. You can configure the *Decommissioned cluster age* field in the *Platform Configuration* -> *System Configuration* page. When configuring this feature, you can add a label for the cluster so that {product-title-short} continues to monitor the cluster even if it becomes nonactive.

Removal of nonactive clusters from {product-title-short} is disabled by default. To enable this setting, enter a nonzero number in the *Decommissioned cluster age* field, as described in the following procedure. The *Decommissioned cluster age* field indicates the number of days that a cluster can remain unreachable before it is considered nonactive. When a cluster is nonactive, the *Clusters* page displays the status of the cluster. Nonactive clusters are indicated with the `unhealthy` label and the window shows the number of days after which the cluster will be removed from {product-title-short} if it continues to remain nonactive. After a cluster is removed from {product-title-short}, that action is documented with an `info` log in the Central logs.

[NOTE]
====
There is a 24-hour grace period after enabling this setting before clusters are removed. The cluster that hosts Central is never removed.
