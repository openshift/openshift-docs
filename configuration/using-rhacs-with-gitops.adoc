You can configure key {product-title-short} attributes by using GitOps workflows by storing the values as code and applying them to {product-title-short} declaratively.

{product-title-short} provides the following two different mechanisms to control two different sets of attributes:

* _Declarative configuration_ is a lightweight mechanism that uses config maps and secrets to configure mostly authentication and authorization resources.
* _Policy as code_ leverages a {product-title-short}-provided custom resource (CR), along with its controller, to manage {product-title-short} policies.
