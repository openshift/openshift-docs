== Using the Node Feature Discovery Operator

The Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Operator orchestrates all resources needed to run the Node-Feature-Discovery daemon set by watching for a `NodeFeatureDiscovery` custom resource (CR). Based on the `NodeFeatureDiscovery` CR, the Operator creates the operand (NFD) components in the selected namespace. You can edit the CR to use another namespace, image, image pull policy, and `nfd-worker-conf` config map, among other options.

As a cluster administrator, you can create a `NodeFeatureDiscovery` CR by using the {oc-first} or the web console.
