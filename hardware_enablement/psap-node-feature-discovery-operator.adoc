Learn about the Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Operator and how you can use it to expose node-level information by orchestrating Node Feature Discovery, a Kubernetes add-on for detecting hardware features and system configuration.

== Using the Node Feature Discovery Operator

The Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Operator orchestrates all resources needed to run the Node-Feature-Discovery daemon set by watching for a `NodeFeatureDiscovery` custom resource (CR). Based on the `NodeFeatureDiscovery` CR, the Operator creates the operand (NFD) components in the selected namespace. You can edit the CR to use another namespace, image, image pull policy, and `nfd-worker-conf` config map, among other options.

As a cluster administrator, you can create a `NodeFeatureDiscovery` CR by using the {oc-first} or the web console.


[NOTE]
====
Starting with version 4.12, the `operand.image` field in the `NodeFeatureDiscovery` CR is mandatory. If the NFD Operator is deployed by using {olm-first}, OLM automatically sets the `operand.image` field. If you create the `NodeFeatureDiscovery` CR by using the {product-title} CLI or the {product-title} web console, you must set the `operand.image` field explicitly.
