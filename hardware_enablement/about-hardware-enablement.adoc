Many applications require specialized hardware or software that depends on kernel modules or drivers. You can use driver containers to load out-of-tree kernel modules on {op-system-first} nodes. To deploy out-of-tree drivers during cluster installation, use the `kmods-via-containers` framework. To load drivers or kernel modules on an existing {product-title} cluster, {product-title} offers several tools:

* The Driver Toolkit is a container image that is a part of every {product-title} release. It contains the kernel packages and other common dependencies that are needed to build a driver or kernel module. The Driver Toolkit can be used as a base image for driver container image builds on {product-title}.
* The Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Operator adds node labels for CPU capabilities, kernel version, PCIe device vendor IDs, and more.
