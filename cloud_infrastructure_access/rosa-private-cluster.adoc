= Configuring a private cluster

An {product-title} cluster can be made private so that internal applications can be hosted inside a corporate network. In addition, private clusters can be configured to have only internal API endpoints for increased security.

// {product-title} administrators can choose between public and private cluster configuration from within the *OpenShift Cluster Manager* (OCM).

Privacy settings can be configured during cluster creation or after a cluster is established.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat Service Reliability Engineers (SREs) can access a public or private cluster through the `cloud-ingress-operator` and existing ElasticSearch Load Balancer or Amazon S3 framework. SREs can access clusters through a secure endpoint to perform maintenance and service tasks.
