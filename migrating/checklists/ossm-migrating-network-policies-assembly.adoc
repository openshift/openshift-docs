toc::[]

In OpenShift {SMProductName} 2, network policies are created by default when `spec.security.manageNetworkPolicy` is set to `true` in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource. During the migration to {SMProduct} 3, these policies are removed.

It is recommended to recreate your network policies after you have migrated your deployment and workloads. However, for security reasons, you may need to recreate them now, and then set `spec.security.manageNetworkPolicy` to `false` as outlined in the migration checklists.

* In your {SMProduct} 2 `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource, set `spec.security.manageNetworkPolicy=` to `false` and continue with migration checklists.
