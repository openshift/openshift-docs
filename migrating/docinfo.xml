<abstract>
    <para>This document describes how to migrate from Red Hat build of Jaeger to Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry. Learn about two migration approaches: migrating with sidecars by replacing Jaeger Agent sidecars with OpenTelemetry Collector sidecars, and migrating without sidecars using standalone Collector deployments. Includes procedures for configuring the Jaeger receiver to maintain protocol compatibility, setting up service accounts and RBAC permissions, enabling sidecar injection, and updating application tracing endpoints to export traces to TempoStack.</para>
