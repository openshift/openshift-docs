toc::[]

Applying autoscaling to an {product-title} cluster involves deploying a
ClusterAutoscaler and then deploying MachineAutoscalers for each Machine type
in your cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can configure the ClusterAutoscaler only in clusters where the machine API is operational.

== Configuring the ClusterAutoscaler

First, deploy the ClusterAutoscaler to manage automatic resource scaling in
your {product-title} cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Because the ClusterAutoscaler is scoped to the entire cluster, you can make only
one ClusterAutoscaler for the cluster.

.Next steps

* After you configure the ClusterAutoscaler, you must configure at least one
MachineAutoscaler.

[id="configuring-machineautoscaler"]
== Configuring the MachineAutoscalers

After you deploy the ClusterAutoscaler,
deploy MachineAutoscaler resources that reference the MachineSets that are used
to scale the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must deploy at least one MachineAutoscaler resource after you deploy the
ClusterAutoscaler resource.
====

[NOTE]
====
You must configure separate resources for each MachineSet. Remember that
MachineSets are different in each region, so consider whether you want to
enable machine scaling in multiple regions. The MachineSet that you scale must have at least one machine in it.
