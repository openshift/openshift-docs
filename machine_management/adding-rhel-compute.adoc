toc::[]

In {product-title}, you can add Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) compute, or worker, machines to a user-provisioned infrastructure cluster or a installation-provisioned infrastructure cluster. You can use RHEL as the operating system on only compute machines.

Amazon Machine Images (AMI) are required because various image formats cannot be used directly by AWS. You may use the AMIs that Red Hat has provided, or you can manually import your own images. The AMI must exist before the EC2 instance can be provisioned. You will need a valid AMI ID so that the correct {op-system-base} version needed for the compute machines is selected.
