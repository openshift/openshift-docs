You can use infrastructure machine sets to create machines that host only infrastructure components, such as the default router, the integrated container image registry, and the components for cluster metrics and monitoring. These infrastructure machines are not counted toward the total number of subscriptions that are required to run the environment.

In a production deployment, it is recommended that you deploy at least three machine sets to hold infrastructure components. {SMProductName} deploys Elasticsearch, which requires three instances to be installed on different nodes. Each of these nodes can be deployed to different availability zones for high availability. This configuration requires three different machine sets, one for each availability zone. In global Azure regions that do not have multiple availability zones, you can use availability sets to ensure high availability.

include::modules/infrastructure-components.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

For information about infrastructure nodes and which components can run on infrastructure nodes, see the "Red Hat OpenShift control plane and infrastructure nodes" section in the link:https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/openshift-subscription-sizing-guide[OpenShift sizing and subscription guide for enterprise Kubernetes] document.

== Creating infrastructure machine sets for production environments

In a production deployment, it is recommended that you deploy at least three compute machine sets to hold infrastructure components. {SMProductName} deploys Elasticsearch, which requires three instances to be installed on different nodes. Each of these nodes can be deployed to different availability zones for high availability. A configuration like this requires three different compute machine sets, one for each availability zone. In global Azure regions that do not have multiple availability zones, you can use availability sets to ensure high availability.

== Assigning machine set resources to infrastructure nodes

After creating an infrastructure machine set, the `worker` and `infra` roles are applied to new infra nodes. Nodes with the `infra` role applied are not counted toward the total number of subscriptions that are required to run the environment, even when the `worker` role is also applied.

However, with an infra node being assigned as a worker, there is a chance user workloads could get inadvertently assigned to an infra node. To avoid this, you can apply a taint to the infra node and tolerations for the pods you want to control.

[id="moving-resources-to-infrastructure-machinesets"]
== Moving resources to infrastructure machine sets

Some of the infrastructure resources are deployed in your cluster by default. You can move them to the infrastructure machine sets that you created by adding the infrastructure node selector, as shown:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  nodePlacement: <1>
    nodeSelector:
      matchLabels:
        node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
    tolerations:
    - effect: NoSchedule
      key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
      value: reserved
    - effect: NoExecute
      key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
      value: reserved
----
<1> Add a `nodeSelector` parameter with the appropriate value to the component you want to move. You can use a `nodeSelector` in the format shown or use `<key>: <value>` pairs, based on the value specified for the node.  If you added a taint to the infrasructure node, also add a matching toleration.

Applying a specific node selector to all infrastructure components causes {product-title} to xref:../machine_management/creating-infrastructure-machinesets.adoc#moving-resources-to-infrastructure-machinesets[schedule those workloads on nodes with that label].
