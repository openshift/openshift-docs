You can add more compute machines to your {product-title} cluster on bare metal.

== Prerequisites

* You xref:../../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.adoc#installing-bare-metal[installed a cluster on bare metal].
* You have installation media and {op-system-first} images that you used to
create your cluster. If you do not have these files, you must obtain them by
following the instructions in the
xref:../../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.adoc#installing-bare-metal[installation procedure].

[IMPORTANT]
====
When adding additional compute machines to your {product-title} cluster, use the
{op-system} boot media that matches the same minor version that was used to
install the {product-title} cluster. For example, if you installed
{product-title} 4.4, you must add additional compute machines using {op-system} 4.4
boot media.

Adding additional compute machines to your cluster using newer {op-system} boot
media is not supported. After adding the compute machines, they will automatically
update to the current version of the {product-title} cluster.

== Creating {op-system-first} machines

Before you add more compute machines to a cluster that you installed on bare
metal infrastructure, you must create {op-system} machines for it to use.
Follow either the steps to use an ISO image or network PXE booting to create the machines.
