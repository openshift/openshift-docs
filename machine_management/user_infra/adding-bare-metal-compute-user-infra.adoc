You can add more compute machines to your {product-title} cluster on bare metal.

== Prerequisites

* You xref:../../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.adoc#installing-bare-metal[installed a cluster on bare metal].
* You have installation media and {op-system-first} images that you used to create your cluster. If you do not have these files, you must obtain them by following the instructions in the xref:../../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.adoc#installing-bare-metal[installation procedure].

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not have access to the {op-system-first} images that were used to create your cluster, you can add more compute machines to your {product-title} cluster with newer versions of {op-system-first} images. For instructions, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5514051[Adding new nodes to UPI cluster fails after upgrading to OpenShift 4.6+].

== Creating {op-system-first} machines

Before you add more compute machines to a cluster that you installed on bare metal infrastructure, you must create {op-system} machines for it to use. You can either use an ISO image or network PXE booting to create the machines.
