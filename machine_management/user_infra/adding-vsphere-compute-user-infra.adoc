You can add more compute machines to your {product-title} cluster on VMware vSphere.

== Prerequisites

* You xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere.adoc#installing-vsphere[installed a cluster on vSphere].

* You have installation media and {op-system-first} images that you used to create your cluster. If you do not have these files, you must obtain them by following the instructions in the xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere.adoc#installing-vsphere[installation procedure].

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not have access to the {op-system-first} images that were used to create your cluster, you can add more compute machines to your {product-title} cluster with newer versions of {op-system-first} images. For instructions, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5514051[Adding new nodes to UPI cluster fails after upgrading to OpenShift 4.6+].
