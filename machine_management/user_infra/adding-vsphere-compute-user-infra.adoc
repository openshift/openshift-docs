You can add more compute machines to your {product-title} cluster on VMware
vSphere.

== Prerequisites

* You xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere.adoc#installing-vsphere[installed a cluster on vSphere].

[IMPORTANT]
====
When adding additional compute machines to your {product-title} cluster, use the
{op-system} boot media that matches the same minor version that was used to
install the {product-title} cluster. For example, if you installed
{product-title} 4.4, you must add additional compute machines using {op-system} 4.4
boot media.

Adding additional compute machines to your cluster using newer {op-system} boot
media is not supported. After adding the compute machines, they will automatically
update to the current version of the {product-title} cluster.
