* If you enabled the cluster-wide proxy and scale up workers not included in `networking.machineNetwork[].cidr` from the installation configuration, you must xref:../networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy.adoc#nw-proxy-configure-object_config-cluster-wide-proxy[add the workers to the Proxy object's `noProxy` field] to prevent connection issues.
