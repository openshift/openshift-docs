You can add or remove an instance of a machine in a compute machine set.

[NOTE]
====
If you need to modify aspects of a compute machine set outside of scaling, see xref:../machine_management/modifying-machineset.adoc#modifying-machineset[Modifying a compute machine set].

== Prerequisites

* If you enabled the cluster-wide proxy and scale up compute machines not included in `networking.machineNetwork[].cidr` from the installation configuration, you must xref:../networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy.adoc#nw-proxy-configure-object_config-cluster-wide-proxy[add the compute machines to the Proxy object's `noProxy` field] to prevent connection issues.
