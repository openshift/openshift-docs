toc::[]

You can modify a compute machine set, such as adding labels, changing the instance type, or changing block storage.

On {rh-virtualization-first}, you can also change a compute machine set to provision new nodes on a different storage domain.

[NOTE]
====
If you need to scale a compute machine set without making other changes, see xref:../machine_management/manually-scaling-machineset.adoc#manually-scaling-machineset[Manually scaling a compute machine set].

== Migrating nodes to a different storage domain on {rh-virtualization}

You can migrate the {product-title} control plane and compute nodes to a different storage domain in a {rh-virtualization-first} cluster.
