= Configuring {gcp-full} features for control plane machines
:context: cpmso-supported-features-gcp

toc::[]

[role="_abstract"]
You can enable or change the configuration of features for your control plane machines by editing values in the control plane machine set specification.

When you save an update to the control plane machine set, the Control Plane Machine Set Operator updates the control plane machines according to your configured update strategy.
For more information, see "Updating the control plane configuration".

//Note: GCP GPU features should be compatible with CPMS, but dev cannot think of a use case. Leaving them out to keep things less cluttered. If a customer use case emerges, we can just add the necessary modules in here.
