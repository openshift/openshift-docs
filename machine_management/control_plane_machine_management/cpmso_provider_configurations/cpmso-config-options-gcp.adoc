toc::[]

You can change the configuration of your {gcp-first} control plane machines and enable features by updating values in the control plane machine set.
When you save an update to the control plane machine set, the Control Plane Machine Set Operator updates the control plane machines according to your configured xref:../../../machine_management/control_plane_machine_management/cpmso-managing-machines.adoc#cpmso-feat-config-update_cpmso-managing-machines[update strategy].

== Sample YAML for configuring {gcp-full} clusters

The following example YAML snippets show provider specification and failure domain configurations for a {gcp-short} cluster.

//Sample GCP provider specification
include::modules/cpmso-yaml-provider-spec-gcp.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

//Sample GCP failure domain configuration
include::modules/cpmso-yaml-failure-domain-gcp.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

[id="cpmso-supported-features-gcp_{context}"]
== Enabling {gcp-full} features for control plane machines

You can enable features by updating values in the control plane machine set.

//Note: GCP GPU features should be compatible with CPMS, but dev cannot think of a use case. Leaving them out to keep things less cluttered. If a customer use case emerges, we can just add the necessary modules in here.
