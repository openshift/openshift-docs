toc::[]

With control plane machine sets, you can automate management of the control plane machine resources within your {product-title} cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Control plane machine sets cannot manage compute machines, and compute machine sets cannot manage control plane machines.
====

Control plane machine sets provide for control plane machines similar management capabilities as compute machine sets provide for compute machines. However, these two types of machine sets are separate custom resources defined within the Machine API and have several fundamental differences in their architecture and functionality.

[id="cpmso-limitations_{context}"]
== Limitations

The Control Plane Machine Set Operator has the following limitations:

* The Operator requires the Machine API Operator to be operational and is therefore not supported on clusters with manually provisioned machines. When installing a {product-title} cluster with manually provisioned machines for a platform that creates an active generated `ControlPlaneMachineSet` custom resource (CR), you must remove the Kubernetes manifest files that define the control plane machine set as instructed in the installation process.

* Only Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), {ibm-power-server-name}, Microsoft Azure, Nutanix, VMware vSphere, and {rh-openstack-first} clusters are supported.

* Only clusters with three control plane machines are supported.

* Horizontal scaling of the control plane is not supported.

* Deploying Azure control plane machines on Ephemeral OS disks increases risk for data loss and is not supported.

* Deploying control plane machines as AWS Spot Instances, GCP preemptible VMs, or Azure Spot VMs is not supported.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Attempting to deploy control plane machines as AWS Spot Instances, GCP preemptible VMs, or Azure Spot VMs might cause the cluster to lose etcd quorum. A cluster that loses all control plane machines simultaneously is unrecoverable.
====

* Making changes to the control plane machine set during or prior to installation is not supported. You must make any changes to the control plane machine set only after installation.
