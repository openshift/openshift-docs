toc::[]

The process for getting started with control plane machine sets depends on the state of the `ControlPlaneMachineSet` custom resource (CR) in your cluster.

Clusters with an active generated CR:: Clusters that have a generated CR with an active state use the control plane machine set by default. No administrator action is required.

Clusters with an inactive generated CR:: For clusters that include an inactive generated CR, you must review the CR configuration and xref:../../machine_management/control_plane_machine_management/cpmso-getting-started.adoc#cpmso-activating_cpmso-getting-started[activate the CR].

Clusters without a generated CR:: For clusters that do not include a generated CR, you must xref:../../machine_management/control_plane_machine_management/cpmso-getting-started.adoc#cpmso-creating-cr_cpmso-getting-started[create and activate a CR] with the appropriate configuration for your cluster.

If you are uncertain about the state of the `ControlPlaneMachineSet` CR in your cluster, you can xref:../../machine_management/control_plane_machine_management/cpmso-getting-started.adoc#cpmso-checking-status_cpmso-getting-started[verify the CR status].

== Supported cloud providers

In {product-title} {product-version}, the control plane machine set is supported for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, Nutanix, and VMware vSphere clusters.

The status of the control plane machine set after installation depends on your cloud provider and the version of {product-title} that you installed on your cluster.
