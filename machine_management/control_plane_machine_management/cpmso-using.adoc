== Enabling Google Cloud Platform features for control plane machines

You can enable Google Cloud Platform (GCP) features on control plane machines by changing the configuration of your control plane machine set. When you save an update to the control plane machine set, the Control Plane Machine Set Operator updates the control plane machines according to your configured update strategy.

//Note: GCP GPU features should be compatible with CPMS, but dev cannot think of a use case. Leaving them out to keep things less cluttered. If a customer use case emerges, we can just add the necessary modules in here.
