You can use the Control Plane Machine Set Operator to improve the resiliency of the control plane for your {product-title} cluster.

== High availability and fault tolerance with failure domains

When possible, the control plane machine set spreads the control plane machines across multiple failure domains. This configuration provides high availability and fault tolerance within the control plane. This strategy can help protect the control plane when issues arise within the infrastructure provider.
