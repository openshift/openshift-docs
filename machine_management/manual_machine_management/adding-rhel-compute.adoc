toc::[]

In {product-title}, you can add {op-system-base-full} compute machines to a user-provisioned infrastructure cluster or an installation-provisioned infrastructure cluster on the `x86_64` architecture. You can use {op-system-base} as the operating system only on compute machines.

== Preparing an image for your cloud

Amazon Machine Images (AMI) are required because various image formats cannot be used directly by AWS. You may use the AMIs that Red Hat has provided, or you can manually import your own images. The AMI must exist before the EC2 instance can be provisioned. You will need a valid AMI ID so that the correct {op-system-base} version needed for the compute machines is selected.
