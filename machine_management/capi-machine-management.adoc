:FeatureName: Managing machines with the Cluster API
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

The link:https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/[Cluster API] is an upstream project that is integrated into {product-title} as a Technology Preview for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure clusters. You can use the Cluster API to create and manage compute machine sets and compute machines in your {product-title} cluster. This capability is in addition or an alternative to managing machines with the Machine API.

For {product-title} {product-version} clusters, you can use the Cluster API to perform node host provisioning management actions after the cluster installation finishes. This system enables an elastic, dynamic provisioning method on top of public or private cloud infrastructure.

With the Cluster API Technology Preview, you can create compute machines and compute machine sets on {product-title} clusters for supported providers. You can also explore the features that are enabled by this implementation that might not be available with the Machine API.

[id="cluster-api-benefits_{context}"]
== Benefits

By using the Cluster API, {product-title} users and developers are able to realize the following advantages:

* The option to use upstream community Cluster API infrastructure providers which might not be supported by the Machine API.

* The opportunity to collaborate with third parties who maintain machine controllers for infrastructure providers.

* The ability to use the same set of Kubernetes tools for infrastructure management in {product-title}.

* The ability to create compute machine sets by using the Cluster API that support features that are not available with the Machine API.

[id="capi-tech-preview-limitations"]
== Limitations

Using the Cluster API to manage machines is a Technology Preview feature and has the following limitations:

* Only AWS, GCP, and Azure clusters are supported.

* To use this feature, you must enable the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` xref:../nodes/clusters/nodes-cluster-enabling-features.adoc#nodes-cluster-enabling-features-about_nodes-cluster-enabling[feature set]. Enabling this feature set cannot be undone and prevents minor version updates.

* You must create the primary resources that the Cluster API requires manually.

* You cannot manage control plane machines by using the Cluster API.

* Migration of existing compute machine sets created by the Machine API to Cluster API compute machine sets is not supported.

* Full feature parity with the Machine API is not available.

[id="capi-sample-yaml-files"]
== Sample YAML files

For the Cluster API Technology Preview, you must create the primary resources that the Cluster API requires manually. The following example YAML files show how to make these resources work together and configure settings for the machines that they create that are appropriate for your environment.

The remaining Cluster API resources are provider-specific. Refer to the example YAML files for your cluster:

* xref:../machine_management/capi-machine-management.adoc#capi-sample-yaml-files-aws[Sample YAML files for configuring Amazon Web Services clusters]

* xref:../machine_management/capi-machine-management.adoc#capi-sample-yaml-files-gcp[Sample YAML files for configuring Google Cloud Platform clusters]
