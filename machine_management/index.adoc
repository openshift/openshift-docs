You can use machine management to flexibly work with underlying infrastructure such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), {rh-openstack-first}, and VMware vSphere to manage the {product-title} cluster.
You can control the cluster and perform auto-scaling, such as scaling up and down the cluster based on specific workload policies.

It is important to have a cluster that adapts to changing workloads. The {product-title} cluster can horizontally scale up and down when the load increases or decreases.

Machine management is implemented as a xref:../operators/understanding/crds/crd-extending-api-with-crds.adoc#crd-extending-api-with-crds[custom resource definition] (CRD).
A CRD object defines a new unique object `Kind` in the cluster and enables the Kubernetes API server to handle the object's entire lifecycle.

The Machine API Operator provisions the following resources:

* `MachineSet`
* `Machine`
* `ClusterAutoscaler`
* `MachineAutoscaler`
* `MachineHealthCheck`

[id="machine-mgmt-intro-autoscaling_{context}"]
== Applying autoscaling to an {product-title} cluster

You can automatically scale your {product-title} cluster to ensure flexibility for changing workloads. To xref:../machine_management/compute_machine_management/applying-autoscaling.adoc#applying-autoscaling[autoscale] your cluster, you must first deploy a cluster autoscaler, and then deploy a machine autoscaler for each compute machine set.

* The xref:../machine_management/compute_machine_management/applying-autoscaling.adoc#cluster-autoscaler-about_applying-autoscaling[_cluster autoscaler_] increases and decreases the size of the cluster based on deployment needs.

* The xref:../machine_management/compute_machine_management/applying-autoscaling.adoc#machine-autoscaler-about_applying-autoscaling[_machine autoscaler_] adjusts the number of machines in the compute machine sets that you deploy in your {product-title} cluster.

== Adding compute machines on user-provisioned infrastructure
User-provisioned infrastructure is an environment where you can deploy infrastructure such as compute, network, and storage resources that host the {product-title}. You can xref:../machine_management/manual_machine_management/user_infra/adding-compute-user-infra-general.adoc#adding-compute-user-infra-general[add compute machines] to a cluster on user-provisioned infrastructure during or after the installation process.

[id="machine-mgmt-intro-add-rhel_{context}"]
== Adding RHEL compute machines to your cluster

As a cluster administrator, you can perform the following actions:
