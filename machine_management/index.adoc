You can use machine management to flexibly work with underlying infrastructure like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), OpenStack, Red Hat Virtualization (RHV), and vSphere to manage the {product-title} cluster.
You can control the cluster and perform auto-scaling, such as scaling up and down the cluster based on specific workload policies.

The {product-title} cluster can horizontally scale up and down when the load increases or decreases.
It is important to have a cluster that adapts to changing workloads.

Machine management is implemented as a xref:../operators/understanding/crds/crd-extending-api-with-crds.adoc#crd-extending-api-with-crds[Custom Resource Definition](CRD).
A CRD object defines a new unique object `Kind` in the cluster and enables the Kubernetes API server to handle the object's entire lifecycle.

The Machine API Operator provisions the following resources:

* MachineSet
* Machine
* Cluster Autoscaler
* Machine Autoscaler
* Machine Health Checks

As a cluster administrator you can:

* Create a machine set on:

[id="machine-mgmt-intro-autoscaling_{context}"]
== Applying autoscaling to an {product-title} cluster

You can automatically scale your {product-title} cluster to ensure flexibility for changing workloads. To xref:../machine_management/applying-autoscaling.adoc#applying-autoscaling[autoscale] your cluster, you must first deploy a cluster autoscaler, and then deploy a machine autoscaler for each compute machine set.

* The xref:../machine_management/applying-autoscaling.adoc#cluster-autoscaler-about_applying-autoscaling[_cluster autoscaler_] increases and decreases the size of the cluster based on deployment needs.

* The xref:../machine_management/applying-autoscaling.adoc#machine-autoscaler-about_applying-autoscaling[_machine autoscaler_] adjusts the number of machines in the compute machine sets that you deploy in your {product-title} cluster.

[id="machine-mgmt-intro-add-for-upi_{context}"]
== Adding compute machines on user-provisioned infrastructure
User-provisioned infrastructure is an environment where you can deploy infrastructure such as compute, network, and storage resources that host the {product-title}. You can xref:../machine_management//user_infra/adding-compute-user-infra-general.adoc#adding-compute-user-infra-general[add compute machines] to a cluster on user-provisioned infrastructure during or after the installation process.

[id="machine-mgmt-intro-add-rhel_{context}"]
== Adding RHEL compute machines to your cluster

As a cluster administrator, you can perform the following actions:

** xref:../machine_management/adding-rhel-compute.adoc#adding-rhel-compute[Add Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) compute machines], also known as worker machines, to a user-provisioned infrastructure cluster or an installation-provisioned infrastructure cluster.
** xref:../machine_management/more-rhel-compute.adoc#more-rhel-compute[Add more Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) compute machines] to an existing cluster.
