toc::[]

If your {product-title} cluster already includes Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) compute machines, which are also known as worker machines, you can add more RHEL compute machines to it.

== Preparing an image for your cloud

Amazon Machine Images (AMI) are required since various image formats cannot be used directly by AWS. You may use the AMIs that Red Hat has provided, or you can manually import your own images. The AMI must exist before the EC2 instance can be provisioned. You must list the AMI IDs so that the correct {op-system-base} version needed for the compute machines is selected.
