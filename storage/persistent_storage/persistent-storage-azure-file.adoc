{product-title} supports Microsoft Azure File volumes. You can
provision your {product-title} cluster with persistent storage using Azure.
Some familiarity with Kubernetes and Azure is assumed.

The Kubernetes persistent volume framework allows administrators to provision a cluster with persistent storage and gives users a way to request those resources without having any knowledge of the underlying infrastructure.
You can provision Azure File volumes dynamically.

Persistent volumes are not bound to a single project or namespace, and you can share them across the {product-title} cluster.
Persistent volume claims are specific to a project or namespace, and can be requested by users for use in applications.


[IMPORTANT]
====
High availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Azure File volumes use Server Message Block.
