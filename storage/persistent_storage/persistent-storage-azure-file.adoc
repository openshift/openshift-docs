{product-title} supports Microsoft Azure File volumes. You can
provision your {product-title} cluster with persistent storage using Azure.
Some familiarity with Kubernetes and Azure is assumed.

The Kubernetes persistent volume framework allows administrators to provision a
cluster with persistent storage and gives users a way to request those
resources without having any knowledge of the underlying infrastructure.
Azure File volumes can be provisioned dynamically.

PersistentVolumes are not bound to a single project or namespace; they can be
shared across the {product-title} cluster.
PersistentVolumeClaims are specific to a project or namespace and can be
requested by users for use in applications.

[IMPORTANT]
====
High availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.
