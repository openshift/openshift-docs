[WARNING]
====
This procedure is specific to the Amazon Web Services Elastic File System (AWS EFS) community Operator, which is only applicable up to {product-title} 4.9. 
====
endif::openshift-rosa[]

The Amazon Web Services Elastic File System (AWS EFS) is a Network File System (NFS) that can be provisioned on {product-title} clusters. AWS also provides and supports a CSI EFS Driver to be used with Kubernetes that allows Kubernetes workloads to leverage this shared file storage.

This document describes the basic steps needed to set up your AWS account to prepare EFS to be used by {product-title}. For more information about AWS EFS, see the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/index.html[AWS EFS documentation].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Red Hat does not provide official support for this feature, including backup and recovery. The customer is responsible for backing up the EFS data and recovering it in the event of an outage or data loss.
====

The high-level process to enable EFS on a cluster is:

. Create an AWS EFS in the AWS account used by the cluster.
. Install the AWS EFS Operator from OperatorHub.
. Create `SharedVolume` custom resources.
. Use the generated persistent volume claims in pod `spec.volumes`.
