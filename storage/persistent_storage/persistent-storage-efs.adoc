{product-title} allows use of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic File System
volumes (EFS). You can provision your {product-title} cluster with persistent
storage using AWS EC2. Some familiarity with Kubernetes and AWS is assumed.

:FeatureName: Elastic File System
include::modules/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+0]

The Kubernetes persistent volume framework allows administrators to provision a
cluster with persistent storage and gives users a way to request those
resources without having any knowledge of the underlying infrastructure.
AWS Elastic Block Store volumes can be provisioned dynamically.
PersistentVolumes are not bound to a single project or namespace; they can be
shared across the {product-title} cluster.
PersistentVolumeClaims are specific to a project or namespace and can be
requested by users.

.Prerequisites
* Configure the AWS security groups to allow inbound NFS traffic
from the EFS volume's security group.
* Configure the AWS EFS volume to allow incoming SSH traffic from any host.
