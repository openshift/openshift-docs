{product-title} allows use of VMware vSphere’s Virtual Machine Disk (VMDK) volumes. You can provision your {product-title} cluster with persistent storage using VMware vSphere. Some familiarity with Kubernetes and VMware vSphere is assumed.

VMware vSphere volumes can be provisioned dynamically. {product-title} creates the disk in vSphere and attaches this disk to the correct image.

The Kubernetes persistent volume framework allows administrators to provision a
cluster with persistent storage and gives users a way to request those
resources without having any knowledge of the underlying infrastructure.

PersistentVolumes are not bound to a single project or namespace; they can be
shared across the {product-title} cluster.
PersistentVolumeClaims are specific to a project or namespace and can be
requested by users.
