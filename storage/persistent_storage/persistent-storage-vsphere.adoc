{product-title} allows use of VMware vSphereâ€™s Virtual Machine Disk (VMDK) volumes. You can provision your {product-title} cluster with persistent storage using VMware vSphere. Some familiarity with Kubernetes and VMware vSphere is assumed.

VMware vSphere volumes can be provisioned dynamically. {product-title} creates the disk in vSphere and attaches this disk to the correct image.

The Kubernetes persistent volume framework allows administrators to provision a
cluster with persistent storage and gives users a way to request those
resources without having any knowledge of the underlying infrastructure.

PersistentVolumes are not bound to a single project or namespace; they can be
shared across the {product-title} cluster.
PersistentVolumeClaims are specific to a project or namespace and can be
requested by users.

== Dynamically provisioning VMware vSphere volumes

Dynamically provisioning VMware vSphere volumes is the recommended method.

== Prerequisites
* An {product-title} cluster installed on a VMware vSphere version that meets the requirements for the components that you use. See xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere.adoc[Installing a cluster on vSphere] for information about vSphere version support.

You can use either of the following procedures to dynamically provision these volumes using the default StorageClass.
