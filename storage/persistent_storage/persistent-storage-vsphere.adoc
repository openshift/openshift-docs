{product-title} allows use of VMware vSphere's Virtual Machine Disk (VMDK) volumes. You can provision your {product-title} cluster with persistent storage using VMware vSphere. Some familiarity with Kubernetes and VMware vSphere is assumed.

VMware vSphere volumes can be provisioned dynamically. {product-title} creates the disk in vSphere and attaches this disk to the correct image.

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} provisions new volumes as independent persistent disks that can freely attach and detach the volume on any node in the cluster. Consequently, you cannot back up volumes that use snapshots, or restore volumes from snapshots. See link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc/GUID-53F65726-A23B-4CF0-A7D5-48E584B88613.html[Snapshot Limitations] for more information.
====

The Kubernetes persistent volume framework allows administrators to provision a
cluster with persistent storage and gives users a way to request those
resources without having any knowledge of the underlying infrastructure.

Persistent volumes are not bound to a single project or namespace; they can be
shared across the {product-title} cluster.
Persistent volume claims are specific to a project or namespace and can be
requested by users.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For new installations, {product-title} 4.13 and later provides automatic migration for the vSphere in-tree volume plugin to its equivalent CSI driver. Updating to {product-title} 4.15 and later also provides automatic migration. For more information about updating and migration, see xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-migration.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-migration[CSI automatic migration].

CSI automatic migration should be seamless. Migration does not change how you use all existing API objects, such as persistent volumes, persistent volume claims, and storage classes.

== Dynamically provisioning VMware vSphere volumes

Dynamically provisioning VMware vSphere volumes is the recommended method.

== Prerequisites
* An {product-title} cluster installed on a VMware vSphere version that meets the requirements for the components that you use. See xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/upi/installing-vsphere.adoc[Installing a cluster on vSphere] for information about vSphere version support.

You can use either of the following procedures to dynamically provision these volumes using the default storage class.
