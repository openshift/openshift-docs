{product-title} supports GCE Persistent Disk volumes (gcePD).
You can provision your {product-title} cluster with persistent storage
using GCE.
Some familiarity with Kubernetes and GCE is assumed.

The Kubernetes persistent volume framework allows administrators to
provision a cluster with persistent storage and gives users a way to
request those resources without having any knowledge of the underlying
infrastructure.

GCE Persistent Disk volumes can be provisioned dynamically.

Persistent volumes are not bound to a single project or namespace;
they can be shared across the {product-title} cluster.
Persistent volume claims are specific to a project or namespace and can be
requested by users.

[IMPORTANT]
====
High availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.
