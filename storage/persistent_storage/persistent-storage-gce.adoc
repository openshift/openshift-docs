{product-title} supports GCE Persistent Disk volumes (gcePD).
You can provision your {product-title} cluster with persistent storage
using GCE.
Some familiarity with Kubernetes and GCE is assumed.

The Kubernetes persistent volume framework allows administrators to
provision a cluster with persistent storage and gives users a way to
request those resources without having any knowledge of the underlying
infrastructure.

GCE Persistent Disk volumes can be provisioned dynamically.

Persistent volumes are not bound to a single project or namespace;
they can be shared across the {product-title} cluster.
Persistent volume claims are specific to a project or namespace and can be
requested by users.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} defaults to using an in-tree (non-CSI) plugin to provision gcePD storage.

In future {product-title} versions, volumes provisioned using existing in-tree plug-ins are planned for migration to their equivalent CSI driver. CSI automatic migration should be seamless. Migration does not change how you use all existing API objects, such as persistent volumes, persistent volume claims, and storage classes.
ifndef::openshift-dedicated[]
For more information about migration, see xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-migration.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-migration[CSI automatic migration].
endif::openshift-dedicated[]

After full migration, in-tree plugins will eventually be removed in future versions of {product-title}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
High availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.
