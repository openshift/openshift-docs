toc::[]

A hostPath volume in an {product-title} cluster mounts a file or directory from the host node’s filesystem into your Pod. Most Pods will not need a hostPath volume, but it does offer a quick option for testing should an application require it.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The cluster administrator must configure Pods to run as privileged. This grants access to Pods in the same node.
