Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation is a provider of agnostic persistent storage for {product-title} supporting file, block, and object storage, either in-house or in hybrid clouds. As a Red Hat storage solution, Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation is completely integrated with {product-title} for deployment, management, and monitoring.

Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation provides its own documentation library. The complete set of Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation documentation identified below is available at https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/4.10/

[IMPORTANT]
====
OpenShift Data Foundation on top of Red Hat Hyperconverged Infrastructure (RHHI) for Virtualization, which uses hyperconverged nodes that host virtual machines installed with {product-title}, is not a supported configuration. For more information about supported platforms, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4731161[Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation Supportability and Interoperability Guide].
