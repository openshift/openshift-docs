You can provision your {product-title} cluster with
persistent storage using
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/managing_storage_devices/index#getting-started-with-iscsi_managing-storage-devices[iSCSI].
Some familiarity with Kubernetes and iSCSI is assumed.

The Kubernetes persistent volume framework allows administrators to
provision a cluster with persistent storage and gives users a way to
request those resources without having any knowledge of the
underlying infrastructure.

[IMPORTANT]
====
High-availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you use iSCSI on Amazon Web Services, you must update the default
security policy to include TCP traffic between nodes on the iSCSI ports.
By default, they are ports `860` and `3260`.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
OpenShift assumes that all nodes in the cluster have already configured iSCSI
initator, i.e. have installed `iscsi-initiator-utils` package and configured
their initiator name in `/etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi`. See Storage
Administration Guide linked above.
