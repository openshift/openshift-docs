{product-title} supports FlexVolume, an out-of-tree plug-in that uses an executable model to interface with drivers.

To use storage from a back-end that does not have a built-in plug-in, you can extend {product-title} through FlexVolume drivers and provide persistent storage to applications.

Pods interact with FlexVolume drivers through the `flexvolume` in-tree plugin.
