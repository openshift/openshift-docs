{product-title} supports OpenStack Cinder.  Some familiarity with Kubernetes and OpenStack is assumed.

Cinder volumes can be provisioned dynamically.
Persistent volumes are not bound to a single project or namespace; they can be
shared across the {product-title} cluster.
Persistent volume claims are specific to a project or namespace and can be
requested by users.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} 4.11 and later provides automatic migration for the Cinder in-tree volume plugin to its equivalent CSI driver.

CSI automatic migration should be seamless. Migration does not change how you use all existing API objects, such as persistent volumes, persistent volume claims, and storage classes. For more information about migration, see xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-migration.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-migration[CSI automatic migration].
