{product-title} supports AWS Elastic Block Store volumes (EBS). You can
provision your {product-title} cluster with persistent storage by using link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html[Amazon EC2].
Some familiarity with Kubernetes and AWS is assumed.

The Kubernetes persistent volume framework allows administrators to provision a
cluster with persistent storage and gives users a way to request those
resources without having any knowledge of the underlying infrastructure.
AWS Elastic Block Store volumes can be provisioned dynamically.
Persistent volumes are not bound to a single project or namespace; they can be
shared across the {product-title} cluster.
Persistent volume claims are specific to a project or namespace and can be
requested by users.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} defaults to using an in-tree (non-CSI) plug-in to provision AWS EBS storage.

In future {product-title} versions, volumes provisioned using existing in-tree plug-ins are planned for migration to their equivalent CSI driver. CSI automatic migration should be seamless. Migration does not change how you use all existing API objects, such as persistent volumes, persistent volume claims, and storage classes. For more information about migration, see xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-migration.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-migration[CSI automatic migration].

After full migration, in-tree plug-ins will eventually be removed in future versions of {product-title}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
High-availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.
====

For {product-title}, automatic migration from AWS EBS in-tree to the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver is available as a Technology Preview (TP) feature.
With migration enabled, volumes provisioned using the existing in-tree driver are automatically migrated to use the AWS EBS CSI driver For more information, see xref:../container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-migration.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-migration[CSI automatic migration feature].

== Additional resources

* See xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-ebs.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-ebs[AWS Elastic Block Store CSI Driver Operator] for information about accessing additional storage options, such as volume snapshots, that are not possible with in-tree volume plug-ins.
