{product-title} clusters are prebuilt with four storage classes that use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. These storage classes are ready to use and some familiarity with Kubernetes and AWS is assumed.

Following are the four prebuilt storage classes:
[options="header"]

|===

| Name | Provisioner

| gp2 | kubernetes.io/aws-ebs

| gp2-csi | ebs.csi.aws.com

| gp3 (default) | kubernetes.io/aws-ebs

| gp3-csi | ebs.csi.aws.com

|===
The gp3 storage class is set as default; however, you can select any of the storage classes as the default storage class.

{product-title} supports Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes.
You can provision your {product-title} cluster with persistent storage by using link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html[Amazon EC2].
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]

The Kubernetes persistent volume framework allows administrators to provision a cluster with persistent storage and gives users a way to request those resources without having any knowledge of the underlying infrastructure.
You can dynamically provision Amazon EBS volumes.
Persistent volumes are not bound to a single project or namespace; they can be shared across the {product-title} cluster.
Persistent volume claims are specific to a project or namespace and can be requested by users.
You can define a KMS key to encrypt container-persistent volumes on AWS.
By default, newly created clusters using {product-title} version 4.10 and later use gp3 storage and the link:https://github.com/openshift/aws-ebs-csi-driver[AWS EBS CSI driver].

[IMPORTANT]
====
High-availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.

For {product-title}, automatic migration from AWS EBS in-tree to the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver is available as a Technology Preview (TP) feature.
With migration enabled, volumes provisioned using the existing in-tree driver are automatically migrated to use the AWS EBS CSI driver. For more information, see xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-migration.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-migration[CSI automatic migration feature].
