{product-title} supports AWS Elastic Block Store volumes (EBS). You can
provision your {product-title} cluster with persistent storage by using link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html[Amazon EC2].
Some familiarity with Kubernetes and AWS is assumed.

The Kubernetes persistent volume framework allows administrators to provision a
cluster with persistent storage and gives users a way to request those
resources without having any knowledge of the underlying infrastructure.
AWS Elastic Block Store volumes can be provisioned dynamically.
Persistent volumes are not bound to a single project or namespace; they can be
shared across the {product-title} cluster.
Persistent volume claims are specific to a project or namespace and can be
requested by users.

[IMPORTANT]
====
High-availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.

== Additional resources

* See xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-ebs.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-ebs[AWS Elastic Block Store CSI Driver Operator] for information about accessing additional storage options, such as volume snapshots, that are not possible with in-tree volume plug-ins.
