{product-title} can be provisioned with persistent storage by using
local volumes. Local persistent volumes allow you to access local storage
devices, such as a disk or partition, by using the standard
PVC interface.

Local volumes can be used without manually scheduling pods to nodes,
because the system is aware of the volume node's constraints. However,
local volumes are still subject to the availability of the underlying node
and are not suitable for all applications.

[NOTE]
====
Local volumes can only be used as a statically created Persistent Volume.
