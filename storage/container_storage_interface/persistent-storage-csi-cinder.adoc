== Overview

{product-title} is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for OpenStack Cinder.

Familiarity with xref:../../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage] and xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi.adoc#persistent-storage-csi[configuring CSI volumes] is recommended when working with a Container Storage Interface (CSI) Operator and driver.

To create CSI-provisioned PVs that mount to OpenStack Cinder storage assets, {product-title} installs the OpenStack Cinder CSI Driver Operator and the OpenStack Cinder CSI driver in the `openshift-cluster-csi-drivers` namespace.

* The _OpenStack Cinder CSI Driver Operator_ provides a CSI storage class that you can use to create PVCs. You can disable this default storage class if desired (see xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-sc-manage.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-sc-manage[Managing the default storage class]).

* The _OpenStack Cinder CSI driver_ enables you to create and mount OpenStack Cinder PVs.

For {product-title}, automatic migration from OpenStack Cinder in-tree to the CSI driver is available as a Technology Preview (TP) feature.
With migration enabled, volumes provisioned using the existing in-tree plugin are automatically migrated to use the OpenStack Cinder CSI driver. For more information, see xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-migration.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-migration[CSI automatic migration feature].

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} defaults to using an in-tree (non-CSI) plugin to provision Cinder storage.

In future {product-title} versions, volumes provisioned using existing in-tree plugins are planned for migration to their equivalent CSI driver. CSI automatic migration should be seamless. Migration does not change how you use all existing API objects, such as persistent volumes, persistent volume claims, and storage classes. For more information about migration, see xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-migration.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-migration[CSI automatic migration].

After full migration, in-tree plugins will eventually be removed in future versions of {product-title}.
