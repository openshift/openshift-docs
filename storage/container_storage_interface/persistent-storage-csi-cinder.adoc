== Overview

{product-title} is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for OpenStack Cinder.

Familiarity with xref:../../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage] and xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi.adoc#persistent-storage-csi[configuring CSI volumes] is recommended when working with a Container Storage Interface (CSI) Operator and driver.

To create CSI-provisioned PVs that mount to OpenStack Cinder storage assets, {product-title} installs the OpenStack Cinder CSI Driver Operator and the OpenStack Cinder CSI driver in the `openshift-cluster-csi-drivers` namespace.

* The _OpenStack Cinder CSI Driver Operator_ provides a CSI storage class that you can use to create PVCs.

* The _OpenStack Cinder CSI driver_ enables you to create and mount OpenStack Cinder PVs.

For {product-title}, automatic migration from OpenStack Cinder in-tree to the CSI driver is available as a Technology Preview (TP) feature.
With migration enabled, volumes provisioned using the existing in-tree plug-in are automatically migrated to use the OpenStack Cinder CSI driver. For more information, see xref:persistent-storage-csi-migration.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-migration[CSI automatic migration feature].
