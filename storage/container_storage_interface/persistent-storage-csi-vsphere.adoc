== Overview

{product-title} can provision persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) VMware vSphere driver for Virtual Machine Disk (VMDK) volumes.

:FeatureName: vSphere CSI Driver Operator
include::modules/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

Familiarity with xref:../../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage] and xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi.adoc#persistent-storage-csi[configuring CSI volumes] is recommended when working with a CSI Operator and driver.

To create CSI-provisioned persistent volumes (PVs) that mount to vSphere storage assets, {product-title}, after this feature is enabled, installs the vSphere CSI Driver Operator and the vSphere CSI driver by default in the `openshift-cluster-csi-drivers` namespace.

* *vSphere CSI Driver Operator*: After being enabled, the Operator provides a storage class, called `thin-csi`, that you can use to create persistent volumes claims (PVCs). The vSphere CSI Driver Operator supports dynamic volume provisioning by allowing storage volumes to be created on-demand, eliminating the need for cluster administrators to pre-provision storage.

* *vSphere CSI driver*: The driver enables you to create and mount vSphere PVs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} defaults to using an in-tree (non-CSI) plug-in to provision vSphere storage.

In future {product-title} versions, volumes provisioned using existing in-tree plug-ins are planned for migration to their equivalent CSI driver. CSI automatic migration should be seamless. Migration does not change how you use all existing API objects, such as persistent volumes, persistent volume claims, and storage classes. For more information about migration, see xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-migration.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-migration[CSI automatic migration].

After full migration, in-tree plug-ins will eventually be removed in future versions of {product-title}.
