== Overview

{product-title} can provision persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) VMware vSphere driver for Virtual Machine Disk (VMDK) volumes.

Familiarity with xref:../../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage] and xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi.adoc#persistent-storage-csi[configuring CSI volumes] is recommended when working with a CSI Operator and driver.

To create CSI-provisioned persistent volumes (PVs) that mount to vSphere storage assets, {product-title} installs the vSphere CSI Driver Operator and the vSphere CSI driver by default in the `openshift-cluster-csi-drivers` namespace.

* *vSphere CSI Driver Operator*: The Operator provides a storage class, called `thin-csi`, that you can use to create persistent volumes claims (PVCs). The vSphere CSI Driver Operator supports dynamic volume provisioning by allowing storage volumes to be created on-demand, eliminating the need for cluster administrators to pre-provision storage.

* *vSphere CSI driver*: The driver enables you to create and mount vSphere PVs. In {product-title} 4.10, the driver version is 2.4.1.

//Please update driver version as needed with each major OCP release starting with 4.13.

//Listing the VMWare driver version here because it has a more variable set of features. The Operator version does not change independently (is parallel).

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} defaults to using an in-tree (non-CSI) plugin to provision vSphere storage.

In future {product-title} versions, volumes provisioned using existing in-tree plugins are planned for migration to their equivalent CSI driver. CSI automatic migration should be seamless. Migration does not change how you use all existing API objects, such as persistent volumes, persistent volume claims, and storage classes. For more information about migration, see xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-migration.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-migration[CSI automatic migration].

After full migration, in-tree plugins will eventually be removed in future versions of {product-title}.
====

[NOTE]
====
The vSphere CSI Driver supports dynamic and static provisioning. When using static provisioning in the PV specifications, do not use the key `storage.kubernetes.io/csiProvisionerIdentity` in `csi.volumeAttributes` because this key indicates dynamically provisioned PVs.
