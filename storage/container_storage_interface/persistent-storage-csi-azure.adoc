== Overview

{product-title} is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for Microsoft Azure Disk Storage.

Familiarity with xref:../../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage] and xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi.adoc#persistent-storage-csi[configuring CSI volumes] is recommended when working with a CSI Operator and driver.

To create CSI-provisioned PVs that mount to Azure Disk storage assets, {product-title} installs the Azure Disk CSI Driver Operator and the Azure Disk CSI driver by default in the `openshift-cluster-csi-drivers` namespace.

* The _Azure Disk CSI Driver Operator_ provides a storage class named `managed-csi` that you can use to create persistent volume claims (PVCs). The Azure Disk CSI Driver Operator supports dynamic volume provisioning by allowing storage volumes to be created on-demand, eliminating the need for cluster administrators to pre-provision storage.

* The _Azure Disk CSI driver_ enables you to create and mount Azure Disk PVs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} defaults to using an in-tree (non-CSI) plugin to provision Azure Disk storage.

In future {product-title} versions, volumes provisioned using existing in-tree plugins are planned for migration to their equivalent CSI driver. CSI automatic migration should be seamless. Migration does not change how you use all existing API objects, such as persistent volumes, persistent volume claims, and storage classes. For more information about migration, see xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-migration.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-migration[CSI automatic migration].

After full migration, in-tree plugins will eventually be removed in later versions of {product-title}.
