== Overview

{product-title} is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for the link:https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Manila[OpenStack Manila] shared file system service.

Familiarity with xref:../../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage] and xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi.adoc#persistent-storage-csi[configuring CSI volumes] is recommended when working with a Container Storage Interface (CSI) Operator and driver.

To create CSI-provisioned PVs that mount to Manila storage assets, {product-title} installs the Manila CSI Driver Operator and the Manila CSI driver by default on any OpenStack cluster that has the Manila service enabled.

* The _Manila CSI Driver Operator_ creates the required storage class that is needed to create PVCs for all available Manila share types. The Operator is installed in the `openshift-cluster-csi-drivers` namespace.

* The _Manila CSI driver_ enables you to create and mount Manila PVs. The driver is installed in the `openshift-manila-csi-driver` namespace.
