[IMPORTANT]
====
The Shared Resource CSI Driver feature is now generally available in link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/builds_for_red_hat_openshift/1.1[{builds-v2title} 1.1]. This feature is now deprecated in {product-title}. To use this feature, ensure you are using {builds-v2title} 1.1 or a more recent version.
====

As a cluster administrator, you can use the Shared Resource CSI Driver in {product-title} to provision inline ephemeral volumes that contain the contents of `Secret` or `ConfigMap` objects. This way, pods and other Kubernetes types that expose volume mounts, and {product-title} Builds can securely use the contents of those objects across potentially any namespace in the cluster. To accomplish this, there are currently two types of shared resources: a `SharedSecret` custom resource for `Secret` objects, and a `SharedConfigMap` custom resource for `ConfigMap` objects.

// The Shared Resource CSI Driver in {product-title}, as opposed to the driver for upstream Kubernetes...
