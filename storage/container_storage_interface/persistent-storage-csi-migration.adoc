toc::[]

Intree storage drivers that are traditionally shipped with {product-title} are being deprecated and removed in favour of their equivalent Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers.
{product-title} provides automatic and seamless migration for supported in-tree volume plug-ins to their equivalent Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers whenever applicable.
