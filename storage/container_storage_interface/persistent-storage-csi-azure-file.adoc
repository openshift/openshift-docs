== Overview

{product-title} is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) by using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for Microsoft Azure File Storage.

:FeatureName: Azure File CSI Driver Operator
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

Familiarity with xref:../../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage] and xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi.adoc#persistent-storage-csi[configuring CSI volumes] is recommended when working with a CSI Operator and driver.

To create CSI-provisioned PVs that mount to Azure File storage assets with this feature enabled, {product-title} installs the Azure File CSI Driver Operator and the Azure File CSI driver by default in the `openshift-cluster-csi-drivers` namespace.

* The _Azure File CSI Driver Operator_, after being enabled, provides a storage class that is named `azurefile-csi` that you can use to create persistent volume claims (PVCs). The Azure File CSI Driver Operator supports dynamic volume provisioning by allowing storage volumes to be created on-demand, eliminating the need for cluster administrators to pre-provision storage.

* The _Azure File CSI driver_ enables you to create and mount Azure File PVs.
