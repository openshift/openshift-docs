== Overview

{product-title} is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) by using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for Microsoft Azure File Storage.

Familiarity with xref:../../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage] and xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi.adoc#persistent-storage-csi[configuring CSI volumes] is recommended when working with a CSI Operator and driver.

To create CSI-provisioned PVs that mount to Azure File storage assets, {product-title} installs the Azure File CSI Driver Operator and the Azure File CSI driver by default in the `openshift-cluster-csi-drivers` namespace.

* The _Azure File CSI Driver Operator_ provides a storage class that is named `azurefile-csi` that you can use to create persistent volume claims (PVCs).

* The _Azure File CSI driver_ enables you to create and mount Azure File PVs. The Azure File CSI driver supports dynamic volume provisioning by allowing storage volumes to be created on-demand, eliminating the need for cluster administrators to pre-provision storage.

Azure File CSI Driver Operator does not support:

* Virtual hard disks (VHD)

* Network File System (NFS): {product-title} does not deploy a NFS-backed storage class.

* Running on nodes with FIPS mode enabled.

For more information about supported features, see xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi.adoc#csi-drivers-supported_persistent-storage-csi[Supported CSI drivers and features].
