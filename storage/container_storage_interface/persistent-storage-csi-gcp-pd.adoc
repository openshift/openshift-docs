== Overview

{product-title} can provision persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) persistent disk (PD) storage.

:FeatureName: GCP PD CSI Driver Operator

Familiarity with xref:../../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage] and xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi.adoc#persistent-storage-csi[configuring CSI volumes] is recommended when working with a Container Storage Interface (CSI) Operator and driver.

To create CSI-provisioned persistent volumes (PVs) that mount to GCP PD storage assets, {product-title} installs the GCP PD CSI Driver Operator and the GCP PD CSI driver by default in the `openshift-cluster-csi-drivers` namespace.

* *GCP PD CSI Driver Operator*: By default, the Operator provides a storage class that you can use to create PVCs. You also have the option to create the GCP PD storage class as described in xref:../../storage/persistent_storage/persistent-storage-gce.adoc#persistent-storage-using-gce[Persistent storage using GCE Persistent Disk].

* *GCP PD driver*: The driver enables you to create and mount GCP PD PVs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} defaults to using an in-tree, or non-CSI, driver to provision GCP PD storage. This in-tree driver will be removed in a subsequent update of {product-title}. Volumes provisioned using the existing in-tree driver are planned for migration to the CSI driver at that time.
