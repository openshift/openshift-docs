== Overview

{product-title} can provision persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) persistent disk (PD) storage.

:FeatureName: GCP PD CSI Driver Operator

Familiarity with xref:../../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage] and xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi.adoc#persistent-storage-csi[configuring CSI volumes] is recommended when working with a Container Storage Interface (CSI) Operator and driver.

To create CSI-provisioned persistent volumes (PVs) that mount to GCP PD storage assets, {product-title} installs the GCP PD CSI Driver Operator and the GCP PD CSI driver by default in the `openshift-cluster-csi-drivers` namespace.

* *GCP PD CSI Driver Operator*: By default, the Operator provides a storage class that you can use to create PVCs. You also have the option to create the GCP PD storage class as described in xref:../../storage/persistent_storage/persistent-storage-gce.adoc#persistent-storage-using-gce[Persistent storage using GCE Persistent Disk].

* *GCP PD driver*: The driver enables you to create and mount GCP PD PVs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} defaults to using an in-tree (non-CSI) plug-in to provision GCP PD storage.

In future {product-title} versions, volumes provisioned using existing in-tree plug-ins are planned for migration to their equivalent CSI driver. CSI automatic migration should be seamless. Migration does not change how you use all existing API objects, such as persistent volumes, persistent volume claims, and storage classes. For more information about migration, see xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-migration.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-migration[CSI automatic migration].

After full migration, in-tree plug-ins will eventually be removed in future versions of {product-title}.
