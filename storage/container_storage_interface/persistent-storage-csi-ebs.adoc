== Overview

{product-title} is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS).

:FeatureName: AWS EBS CSI Driver Operator
include::modules/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

Familiarity with xref:../../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage] and xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi.adoc#persistent-storage-csi[configuring CSI volumes] is recommended when working with a Container Storage Interface (CSI) Operator and driver.

To create CSI-provisioned PVs that mount to AWS EBS storage assets, {product-title} installs the AWS EBS CSI Driver Operator and the AWS EBS CSI driver by default in the `openshift-cluster-csi-drivers` namespace.

* The _AWS EBS CSI Driver Operator_ provides a StorageClass by default that you can use to create PVCs. You also have the option to create the AWS EBS StorageClass as described in xref:../../storage/persistent_storage/persistent-storage-aws.adoc#persistent-storage-aws[Persistent storage using AWS Elastic Block Store].

* The _AWS EBS CSI driver_ enables you to create and mount AWS EBS PVs.

[NOTE]
====
If you installed the AWS EBS CSI Operator and driver on a {product-title} 4.5 cluster, you must uninstall the 4.5 Operator and driver before you update to {product-title} {product-version}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} defaults to using an in-tree, or non-CSI, driver to provision AWS EBS storage. This in-tree driver will be removed in a subsequent update of {product-title}. Volumes provisioned using the existing in-tree driver are planned for migration to the CSI driver at that time.
