== Overview

{product-title} is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS).

Familiarity with xref:../../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage] and xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi.adoc#persistent-storage-csi[configuring CSI volumes] is recommended when working with a Container Storage Interface (CSI) Operator and driver.

To create CSI-provisioned PVs that mount to AWS EBS storage assets, {product-title} installs the AWS EBS CSI Driver Operator and the AWS EBS CSI driver by default in the `openshift-cluster-csi-drivers` namespace.

* The _AWS EBS CSI Driver Operator_ provides a StorageClass by default that you can use to create PVCs. You also have the option to create the AWS EBS StorageClass as described in xref:../../storage/persistent_storage/persistent-storage-aws.adoc#persistent-storage-aws[Persistent storage using AWS Elastic Block Store].

* The _AWS EBS CSI driver_ enables you to create and mount AWS EBS PVs.

[NOTE]
====
If you installed the AWS EBS CSI Operator and driver on a {product-title} 4.5 cluster, you must uninstall the 4.5 Operator and driver before you update to {product-title} {product-version}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} defaults to using an in-tree (non-CSI) plug-in to provision AWS EBS storage.

In future {product-title} versions, volumes provisioned using existing in-tree plug-ins are planned for migration to their equivalent CSI driver. CSI automatic migration should be seamless. Migration does not change how you use all existing API objects, such as persistent volumes, persistent volume claims, and storage classes. For more information about migration, see xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-migration.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-migration[CSI automatic migration].

After full migration, in-tree plug-ins will eventually be removed in future versions of {product-title}.
