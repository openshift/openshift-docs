== Overview

{product-title} is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for Google Compute Platform (GCP) Filestore Storage.

Familiarity with xref:../../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#understanding-persistent-storage[persistent storage] and xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi.adoc#persistent-storage-csi[configuring CSI volumes] is recommended when working with a CSI Operator and driver.

To create CSI-provisioned PVs that mount to {gcp-short} Filestore Storage assets, you install the {gcp-short} Filestore CSI Driver Operator and the {gcp-short} Filestore CSI driver in the `openshift-cluster-csi-drivers` namespace.

* The _{gcp-short} Filestore CSI Driver Operator_ does not provide a storage class by default, but xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-google-cloud-file.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-google-cloud-file-create-sc_persistent-storage-csi-google-cloud-file[you can create one if needed]. The {gcp-short} Filestore CSI Driver Operator supports dynamic volume provisioning by allowing storage volumes to be created on demand, eliminating the need for cluster administrators to pre-provision storage.

* The _{gcp-short} Filestore CSI driver_ enables you to create and mount {gcp-short} Filestore PVs.

{product-title} {gcp-short} Filestore supports Workload Identity. This allows users to access Google Cloud resources using federated identities instead of a service account key. {gcp-wid-short} must be enabled globally during installation, and then configured for the {gcp-short} Filestore CSI Driver Operator. For more information, see xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-google-cloud-file.adoc#installing-the-gcp-filestore-csi-driver-operator[Installing the {gcp-short} Filestore CSI Driver Operator].
