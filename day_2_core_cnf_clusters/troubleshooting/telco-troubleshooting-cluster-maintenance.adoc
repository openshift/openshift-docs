In telco networks, you must pay more attention to certain configurations due the nature of bare-metal deployments.
You can troubleshoot more effectively by completing these tasks:

* Monitor for failed or failing hardware components
* Periodically check the status of the cluster Operators

[NOTE]
====
For hardware monitoring, contact your hardware vendor to find the appropriate logging tool for your specific hardware.
