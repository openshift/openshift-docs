{product-title} Monitoring collects metrics from targeted cluster components by scraping data from exposed service endpoints. 

In the *Administrator* perspective in the {product-title} web console, you can use the *Metrics Targets* page to view, search, and filter the endpoints that are currently targeted for scraping, which helps you to identify and troubleshoot problems. 
For example, you can view the current status of targeted endpoints to see when {product-title} Monitoring is not able to scrape metrics from a targeted component. 

The *Metrics Targets* page shows targets for default {product-title} projects and for user-defined projects.
