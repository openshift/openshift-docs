= Configuring monitoring stack
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

Prior to {product-title} 4.0, the Prometheus Cluster Monitoring stack was configured through the Ansible inventory file. For that purpose, the stack exposed a subset of its available configuration options as Ansible variables. You configured the stack prior to the installation of {product-title}.

In {product-title} 4.0, Ansible is not the primary technology to install {product-title} anymore. The installer only provides a very low number of configuration options pre-installation. Configuring any OpenShift framework components, including the Prometheus Cluster Monitoring stack, happens post-installation.

This section explains what configuration is supported, shows how to configure the monitoring stack, and demonstrates several common configuration scenarios.

.Prerequisites

* The monitoring stack imposes additional resource requirements. Consult the computing resources recommendations in xref:../scalability_and_performance/scaling-cluster-monitoring-operator.adoc#scaling-cluster-monitoring-operator[Scaling the Cluster Monitoring Operator] and verify that you have sufficient resources.

.Additional resources

* See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/prometheus_cluster_monitoring.html#configuring-openshift-cluster-monitoring[the documentation for configuring the monitoring stack on {product-title} 3.11].

[id='configuring-persistent-storage']
== Configuring persistent storage

Running cluster monitoring with persistent storage means that your metrics are stored to a persistent volume and can survive a pod being restarted or recreated. This is ideal if you require your metrics or alerting data to be guarded from data loss. For production environments, it is highly recommended to configure persistent storage.

.Prerequisites

* Dedicate sufficient persistent storage to ensure that the disk does not become full. How much storage you need depends on the number of pods. For information on system requirements for persistent storage, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/scaling-cluster-monitoring-operator.adoc#prometheus-database-storage-requirements[Prometheus database storage requirements].
// FIXME if possible, link the string "enable dynamically-provisioned storage" to section "Enabling dynamically-provisioned storage"
* Unless you enable dynamically-provisioned storage, make sure you have a persistent volume (PV) ready to be claimed by the PVC, one PV for each replica. Prometheus has two replicas and Alertmanager has three replicas, which amounts to five PVs.
* Use the block storage.

== Configuring Alertmanager

The Alertmanager manages incoming alerts, including silencing, inhibition, aggregation, and sending out notifications through methods such as email, PagerDuty, and HipChat.
