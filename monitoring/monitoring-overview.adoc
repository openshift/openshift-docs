== About {product-title} monitoring

{product-title} includes a preconfigured, preinstalled, and self-updating monitoring stack that provides monitoring for core platform components. You also have the option to xref:../monitoring/enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects.adoc#enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects[enable monitoring for user-defined projects].

A cluster administrator can xref:../monitoring/configuring-the-monitoring-stack.adoc#configuring-the-monitoring-stack[configure the monitoring stack] with the supported configurations. {product-title} delivers monitoring best practices out of the box.

A set of alerts are included by default that immediately notify cluster administrators about issues with a cluster. Default dashboards in the {product-title} web console include visual representations of cluster metrics to help you to quickly understand the state of your cluster.

The {product-title} web console provides xref:../monitoring/accessing-third-party-uis.adoc#accessing-third-party-uis[third-party integrated UIs] such as xref:../monitoring/managing-metrics.adoc#managing-metrics[metrics], xref:../monitoring/managing-alerts.adoc#managing-alerts[alerts], and xref:../monitoring/reviewing-monitoring-dashboards.adoc#reviewing-monitoring-dashboards[review of monitoring dashboards]. You can access these third-party user interfaces (UIs) either through the web console or the CLI.

After installing {product-title} {product-version}, cluster administrators can optionally enable monitoring for user-defined projects. By using this feature, cluster administrators, developers, and other users can specify how services and pods are monitored in their own projects. You can also xref:../monitoring/exposing-custom-application-metrics-for-autoscaling.adoc#exposing-custom-application-metrics-for-autoscaling[expose custom application metrics] for horizontal pod autoscaling.
As a cluster administrator, you can find answers to common problems such as user metrics unavailability and Prometheus consuming a lot of disk space in xref:../monitoring/troubleshooting-monitoring-issues.adoc#troubleshooting-monitoring-issues[troubleshooting monitoring issues].
