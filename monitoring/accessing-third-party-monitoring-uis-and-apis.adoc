In {product-title} {product-version}, you cannot access third-party web browser user interfaces (UIs) for the following monitoring components: Alertmanager, Thanos Ruler, and Thanos Querier. 
However, you can access web UIs for Grafana and Prometheus, although this access is deprecated and is planned to be removed in a future {product-title} release.
In addition, you can access web service APIs for third-party monitoring components from the command line interface (CLI).
