{product-title} uses the Prometheus open source monitoring system. The stack built around Prometheus provides {product-title} cluster monitoring by default. It also provides custom-configured application monitoring as a technology preview. The cluster monitoring stack is only supported for monitoring {product-title} clusters.

=== Configuring the monitoring stack

Prior to {product-title} 4, the Prometheus Cluster Monitoring stack was configured through the Ansible inventory file. For that purpose, the stack exposed a subset of its available configuration options as Ansible variables. You configured the stack before you installed {product-title}.

In {product-title} 4, Ansible is not the primary technology to install {product-title} anymore. The installer only provides a very low number of configuration options pre-installation. Configuring most OpenShift framework components, including the Prometheus Cluster Monitoring stack, happens post-installation.

This section explains what configuration is supported, shows how to configure the monitoring stack, and demonstrates several common configuration scenarios.

.Prerequisites

* The monitoring stack imposes additional resource requirements. Consult the computing resources recommendations in xref:../scalability_and_performance/scaling-cluster-monitoring-operator.adoc#scaling-cluster-monitoring-operator[Scaling the Cluster Monitoring Operator] and verify that you have sufficient resources.

[id='configuring-persistent-storage']
==== Configuring persistent storage

Running cluster monitoring with persistent storage means that your metrics are stored to a Persistent Volume and can survive a pod being restarted or recreated. This is ideal if you require your metrics or alerting data to be guarded from data loss. For production environments, it is highly recommended to configure persistent storage.

.Prerequisites

* Dedicate sufficient persistent storage to ensure that the disk does not become full. How much storage you need depends on the number of pods. For information on system requirements for persistent storage, see xref:../scalability_and_performance/scaling-cluster-monitoring-operator.adoc#prometheus-database-storage-requirements[Prometheus database storage requirements].
* Unless you enable dynamically-provisioned storage, make sure you have a Persistent Volume (PV) ready to be claimed by the Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), one PV for each replica. Since Prometheus has two replicas and Alertmanager has three replicas, you need five PVs to support the entire monitoring stack.
* Use the block type of storage.

[id="configuring-alertmanager"]
==== Configuring Alertmanager

The Prometheus Alertmanager is a component that manages incoming alerts, including:

* Alert silencing
* Alert inhibition
* Alert aggregation
* Reliable deduplication of alerts
* Grouping alerts
* Sending grouped alerts as notifications through receviers such as email, PagerDuty, and HipChat

=== Managing alerts using Alertmanager UI

{product-title} 4 provides a Web interface to the Alertmanager, which enables you to manage alerts. This section demonstrates how to use the Alertmanager UI.

[id='application-monitoring']
=== Application monitoring

You can configure custom metrics scraping for your applications. For that, you deploy the Prometheus Operator for the cluster and a custom Prometheus instance and Alertmanager instance in the namespace where your application is.
