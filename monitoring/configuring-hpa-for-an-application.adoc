You can configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) for an application that exports metrics.

:FeatureName: Horizontal Pod Autoscaling for an application
include::modules/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+0]

== Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You must log in to the cluster with a user that has the `cluster-admin` role.
* Make sure you configured the cluster for application monitoring. In the following example, it is presumed that Prometheus and Alertmanager instances were installed in the `default` project. See xref:../monitoring/application-monitoring.adoc#configuring-cluster-for-application-monitoring_application-monitoring[Application monitoring].
* Make sure you configured monitoring for your application. In the following example, it is presumed that the application and the service monitor for it were installed in the `default` project. See xref:../monitoring/application-monitoring.adoc#configuring-monitoring-for-an-application_application-monitoring[Application monitoring].
* Make sure your application exposes metrics using the `prometheus-adapter`. In the following example, it is presumed that `prometheus-adapater` was installed in the `default` project. See xref:../monitoring/application-monitoring.adoc#exposing-custom-application-metrics-for-horizontal-pod-autoscaling_application-monitoring[Application monitoring].
