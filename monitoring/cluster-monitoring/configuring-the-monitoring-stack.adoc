Prior to {product-title} 4, the Prometheus Cluster Monitoring stack was configured through the Ansible inventory file. For that purpose, the stack exposed a subset of its available configuration options as Ansible variables. You configured the stack before you installed {product-title}.

In {product-title} 4, Ansible is not the primary technology to install {product-title} anymore. The installation program provides only a very low number of configuration options before installation. Configuring most OpenShift framework components, including the Prometheus Cluster Monitoring stack, happens post-installation.

This section explains what configuration is supported, shows how to configure the monitoring stack, and demonstrates several common configuration scenarios.

.Prerequisites

* The monitoring stack imposes additional resource requirements. Consult the computing resources recommendations in xref:../../scalability_and_performance/scaling-cluster-monitoring-operator.adoc#scaling-cluster-monitoring-operator[Scaling the Cluster Monitoring Operator] and verify that you have sufficient resources.

== Configuring persistent storage

Running cluster monitoring with persistent storage means that your metrics are stored to a Persistent Volume and can survive a pod being restarted or recreated. This is ideal if you require your metrics or alerting data to be guarded from data loss. For production environments, it is highly recommended to configure persistent storage. Because of the high IO demands, it is advantageous to use local storage.

[IMPORTANT]
====
See xref:../../scalability_and_performance/optimizing-storage.adoc#recommended-configurable-storage-technology_persistent-storage[Recommended configurable storage technology].
====

.Prerequisites

* Dedicate sufficient local persistent storage to ensure that the disk does not become full. How much storage you need depends on the number of pods. For information on system requirements for persistent storage, see xref:../../scalability_and_performance/scaling-cluster-monitoring-operator.adoc#prometheus-database-storage-requirements[Prometheus database storage requirements].
* Make sure you have a Persistent Volume (PV) ready to be claimed by the Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), one PV for each replica. Since Prometheus has two replicas and Alertmanager has three replicas, you need five PVs to support the entire monitoring stack. The Persistent Volumes should be available from the Local Storage Operator. This does not apply if you enable dynamically provisioned storage.
* Use the block type of storage.

[id="configuring-alertmanager"]
== Configuring Alertmanager

The Prometheus Alertmanager is a component that manages incoming alerts, including:

* Alert silencing
* Alert inhibition
* Alert aggregation
* Reliable deduplication of alerts
* Grouping alerts
* Sending grouped alerts as notifications through receivers such as email, PagerDuty, and HipChat
