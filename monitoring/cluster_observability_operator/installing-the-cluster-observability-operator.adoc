As a cluster administrator, you can install the Cluster Observability Operator (COO) from OperatorHub by using the {product-title} web console or CLI.
OperatorHub is a user interface that works in conjunction with Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), which installs and manages Operators on a cluster.

To install the COO using OperatorHub, follow the procedure described in xref:../../operators/admin/olm-adding-operators-to-cluster.adoc[Adding Operators to a cluster].
