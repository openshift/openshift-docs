:FeatureName: The Cluster Observability Operator
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

The Cluster Observability Operator (COO) is an optional component of the {product-title}. You can deploy it to create standalone monitoring stacks that are independently configurable for use by different services and users.

The COO deploys the following monitoring components:

* Prometheus
* Thanos Querier (optional)
* Alertmanager (optional)

The COO components function independently of the default in-cluster monitoring stack, which is deployed and managed by the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO).
Monitoring stacks deployed by the two Operators do not conflict. You can use a COO monitoring stack in addition to the default platform monitoring components deployed by the CMO.
