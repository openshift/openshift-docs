The Cluster Observability Operator (COO) is an optional {product-title} Operator that enables administrators to create standalone monitoring stacks that are independently configurable for use by different services and users.

COO complements the built-in monitoring capabilities of {product-title}. You can deploy it in parallel with the default platform and user workload monitoring stacks managed by the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO). 

These release notes track the development of the Cluster Observability Operator in {product-title}.
