:FeatureName: The Cluster Observability Operator

You can monitor metrics for a service by configuring monitoring stacks managed by the Cluster Observability Operator (COO).

To test monitoring a service, follow these steps:

* Deploy a sample service that defines a service endpoint.
* Create a `ServiceMonitor` object that specifies how the service is to be monitored by the COO.
* Create a `MonitoringStack` object to discover the `ServiceMonitor` object.
