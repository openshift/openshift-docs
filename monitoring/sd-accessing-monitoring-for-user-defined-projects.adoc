When you install a {product-title}
ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
(ROSA)
endif::openshift-rosa[]
cluster, monitoring for user-defined projects is enabled by default. With monitoring for user-defined projects enabled, you can monitor your own
ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
ROSA
endif::openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
{product-title}
endif::openshift-dedicated[]
projects without the need for an additional monitoring solution.

The `dedicated-admin` user has default permissions to configure and access monitoring for user-defined projects.

[NOTE]
====
Custom Prometheus instances and the Prometheus Operator installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) can cause issues with user-defined project monitoring if it is enabled. Custom Prometheus instances are not supported.
====

Optionally, you can disable monitoring for user-defined projects during or after a cluster installation.
