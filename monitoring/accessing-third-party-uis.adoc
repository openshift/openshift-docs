{product-title} also provides access to the Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana third-party interfaces.

[NOTE]
====
Default access to the third-party monitoring interfaces might be removed in future {product-title} releases. Following this, you will need to use port-forwarding to access them.

[NOTE]
====
The Grafana instance that is provided with the {product-title} monitoring stack, along with its dashboards, is read-only.
====

[NOTE]
====
The Grafana dashboard includes Kubernetes and `cluster-monitoring` metrics only. Additional platform components are included in *Monitoring* â†’ *Dashboards* in the {product-title} web console.
