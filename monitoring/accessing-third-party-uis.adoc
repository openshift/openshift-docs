Integrated Metrics, Alerting, and Dashboard UIs are provided in the {product-title} web console. See the following for details on using these integrated UIs:

* xref:../monitoring/managing-metrics.adoc#managing-metrics[Managing metrics]
* xref:../monitoring/managing-alerts.adoc#managing-alerts[Managing alerts]
* xref:../monitoring/reviewing-monitoring-dashboards.adoc#reviewing-monitoring-dashboards[
Reviewing monitoring dashboards]

{product-title} also provides access to the Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana third-party interfaces. Dashboards for some additional platform components are included in *Monitoring* → *Dashboards* in the {product-title} web console.

[NOTE]
====
Default access to the third-party monitoring interfaces might be removed in future {product-title} releases. Following this, you will need to use port-forwarding to access them.
====

[NOTE]
====
The Grafana instance that is provided with the {product-title} monitoring stack, along with its dashboards, is read-only. The Grafana dashboard includes Kubernetes and `cluster-monitoring` metrics only.
