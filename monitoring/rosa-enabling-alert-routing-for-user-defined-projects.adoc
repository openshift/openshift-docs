In {product-title}, a cluster administrator can enable alert routing for user-defined projects. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Managing alerting rules for user-defined projects is only available in {product-title} version 4.11 and later. 
====

This process consists of two general steps:

* Enable alert routing for user-defined projects to use a separate Alertmanager instance.
* Grant additional users permission to configure alert routing for user-defined projects.

After you complete these steps, developers and other users can configure custom alerts and alert routing for their user-defined projects.
