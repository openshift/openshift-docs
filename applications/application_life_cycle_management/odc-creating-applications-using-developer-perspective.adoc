The *Developer* perspective in the web console provides you the following options from the *+Add* view to create applications and associated services and deploy them on {product-title}:

* *From Git*: Use this option to import an existing codebase in a Git repository to create, build, and deploy an application on {product-title}.
* *Container Image*: Use existing images from an image stream or registry to deploy it on to {product-title}.
* *From Dockerfile*: Import a dockerfile from your Git repository to build and deploy an application.
* *YAML*: Use the editor to add YAML or JSON definitions to create and modify resources.
* *From Catalog*: Explore the *Developer Catalog* to select the required applications, services, or source to image builders and add it to your project.
* *Database*: See the *Developer Catalog* to select the required database service and add it to your application.
