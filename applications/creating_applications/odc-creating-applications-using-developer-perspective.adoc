** *Build with guided documentation*: Follow the guided documentation to build applications and familiarize yourself with key concepts and terminologies.
** *Explore new developer features*: Explore the new features and resources within the *Developer* perspective.

* *Developer catalog*: Explore the Developer Catalog to select the required applications, services, or source to image builders, and then add it to your project.
** *All Services*: Browse the catalog to discover services across {product-title}.
** *Database*: Select the required database service and add it to your application.
** *Operator Backed*: Select and deploy the required Operator-managed service.
** *Helm chart*: Select the required Helm chart to simplify deployment of applications and services.

* *Git repository*: Import an existing codebase, Devfile, or Dockerfile from your Git repository using the *From Git*, *From Devfile*, or *From Dockerfile* options respectively, to build and deploy an application on {product-title}.

* *Container images*: Use existing images from an image stream or registry to deploy it on to the {product-title}.

* *Pipelines*: Use Tekton pipeline to create CI/CD pipelines for your software delivery process on the {product-title}.

* *Serverless*: Explore the *Serverless* options to create, build, and deploy stateless and serverless applications on the {product-title}.
** *Channel*: Create a Knative channel to create an event forwarding and persistence layer with in-memory and reliable implementations.

* *Samples*: Explore the available sample applications to create, build, and deploy an application quickly.

* *From Local Machine*: Explore the *From Local Machine* tile to import or upload files on your local machine for building and deploying applications easily.

== Prerequisites

To create applications using the *Developer* perspective ensure that:

* You have xref:../../web_console/web-console.adoc#web-console[logged in to the web console].
* You are in the xref:../../web_console/odc-about-developer-perspective.adoc#odc-about-developer-perspective[*Developer* perspective].
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate xref:../../authentication/using-rbac.adoc#default-roles_using-rbac[roles and permissions] to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale[]

To create serverless applications, in addition to the preceding prerequisites, ensure that:

* You have xref:../../serverless/admin_guide/install-serverless-operator.adoc#install-serverless-operator[installed the {ServerlessOperatorName}].
* You have xref:../../serverless/admin_guide/installing-knative-serving.adoc#installing-knative-serving[created a `KnativeServing` resource in the `knative-serving` namespace].
