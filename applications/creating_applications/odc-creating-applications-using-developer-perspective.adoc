== Prerequisites

To create applications using the *Developer* perspective ensure that:

* You have xref:../../web_console/web-console.adoc#web-console[logged in to the web console].
* You are in the xref:../../web_console/odc-about-developer-perspective.adoc#odc-about-developer-perspective[*Developer* perspective].
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate xref:../../authentication/using-rbac.adoc#default-roles_using-rbac[roles and permissions] to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale[]

To create serverless applications, in addition to the preceding prerequisites, ensure that:

* You have xref:../../serverless/admin_guide/install-serverless-operator.adoc#install-serverless-operator[installed the OpenShift Serverless Operator].
* You have xref:../../serverless/admin_guide/installing-knative-serving.adoc#installing-knative-serving[created a `KnativeServing` resource in the `knative-serving` namespace].
