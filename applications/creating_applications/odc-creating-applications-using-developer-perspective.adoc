* *Git repository*: Import an existing codebase, Devfile, or Dockerfile from your Git repository using the *From Git*, *From Devfile*, or *From Dockerfile* options respectively, to build and deploy an application on {product-title}.

* *Container images*: Use existing images from an image stream or registry to deploy it on to the {product-title}.

* *Pipelines*: Use Tekton pipeline to create CI/CD pipelines for your software delivery process on the {product-title}.

* *Serverless*: Explore the *Serverless* options to create, build, and deploy stateless and serverless applications on the {product-title}.
** *Channel*: Create a Knative channel to create an event forwarding and persistence layer with in-memory and reliable implementations.

* *Samples*: Explore the available sample applications to create, build, and deploy an application quickly.

* *Quick Starts*: Explore the quick start options to create, import, and run applications with step-by-step instructions and tasks.

* *From Local Machine*: Explore the *From Local Machine* tile to import or upload files on your local machine for building and deploying applications easily.
** *Import YAML*: Upload a YAML file to create and define resources for building and deploying applications.
** *Upload JAR file*: Upload a JAR file to build and deploy Java applications.

* *Share my Project*: Use this option to add or remove users to a project and provide accessibility options to them.

* *Helm Chart repositories*: Use this option to add Helm Chart repositories in a namespace.

* *Re-ordering of resources*: Use these resources to re-order pinned resources added to your navigation pane. The drag-and-drop icon is displayed on the left side of the pinned resource when you hover over it in the navigation pane. The dragged resource can be dropped only in the section where it resides.

== Prerequisites

To create applications using the *Developer* perspective ensure that:

* You have xref:../../web_console/web-console.adoc#web-console[logged in to the web console].
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate xref:../../authentication/using-rbac.adoc#default-roles_using-rbac[roles and permissions] to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale[]

To create serverless applications, in addition to the preceding prerequisites, ensure that:

* You have link:https://docs.openshift.com/serverless/1.28/install/install-serverless-operator.html#install-serverless-operator[installed the {ServerlessOperatorName}].
* You have link:https://docs.openshift.com/serverless/1.28/install/installing-knative-serving.html#installing-knative-serving[created a `KnativeServing` resource in the `knative-serving` namespace].
