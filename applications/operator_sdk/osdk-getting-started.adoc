This guide walks Operator authors through an example of building a simple
Go-based Memcached Operator and managing its lifecycle on a Kubernetes-based
cluster (such as {product-title}) from installation to upgrade. This is
accomplished using two centerpieces of the Operator Framework: the Operator SDK
(the `operator-sdk` CLI tool and `controller-runtime` library API) and the
Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

== Getting involved

This guide provides an effective demonstration of the value of the Operator
Framework for building and managing Operators, but this is much more left out in
the interest of brevity. The Operator Framework and its components are open
source, so visit each project individually and learn what else you can do:
