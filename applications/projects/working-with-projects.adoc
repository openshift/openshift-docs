toc::[]

A _project_ allows a community of users to organize and manage their content in
isolation from other communities.

[NOTE]
====
Projects starting with `openshift-` and `kube-` are  xref:../../authentication/using-rbac.adoc#rbac-default-projects_using-rbac[default projects]. These projects host cluster components that run as pods and other infrastructure components. As such, {product-title} does not allow you to create projects starting with `openshift-` or `kube-` using the `oc new-project` command. Cluster administrators can create these projects using the `oc adm new-project` command.
====

[NOTE]
====
You cannot assign an SCC to pods created in one of the default namespaces: `default`, `kube-system`, `kube-public`, `openshift-node`, `openshift-infra`, and `openshift`. You cannot use these namespaces for running pods or services.
