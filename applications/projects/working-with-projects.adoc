A _project_ allows a community of users to organize and manage their content in
isolation from other communities.

[NOTE]
====
Projects starting with `openshift-` and `kube-` are  xref:../../authentication/using-rbac.adoc#rbac-default-projects_using-rbac[default projects]. These projects host cluster components that run as pods and other infrastructure components. As such, {product-title} does not allow you to create projects starting with `openshift-` or `kube-` using the `oc new-project` command. Cluster administrators can create these projects using the `oc adm new-project` command.
====

[NOTE]
====
You cannot assign an SCC to pods created in one of the default namespaces: `default`, `kube-system`, `kube-public`, `openshift-node`, `openshift-infra`, and `openshift`. You cannot use these namespaces for running pods or services.

[id="working-with-projects-deleting-project"]
== Deleting a project

You can use the {product-title} web console or the {oc-first} to delete a project.

When you delete a project, the server updates the project status to *Terminating* from *Active*. Then, the server clears all content from a project that is in the *Terminating* state before finally removing the project. While a project is in *Terminating* status, you cannot add new content to the project. Projects can be deleted from the CLI or the web console.
