You can create Helm releases on an {product-title} cluster using the following methods:

* The CLI.
* The *Developer* perspective of the web console.

The *Developer Catalog*, in the *Developer* perspective of the web console, displays the Helm charts available in the cluster. By default, it lists the Helm charts from the Red Hat OpenShift Helm chart repository. For a list of the charts, see link:https://charts.openshift.io/index.yaml[the Red Hat `Helm index` file].

As a cluster administrator, you can add multiple cluster-scoped and namespace-scoped Helm chart repositories, separate from the default cluster-scoped Helm repository, and display the Helm charts from these repositories in the *Developer Catalog*.

As a regular user or project member with the appropriate role-based access control (RBAC) permissions, you can add multiple namespace-scoped Helm chart repositories, apart from the default cluster-scoped Helm repository, and display the Helm charts from these repositories in the *Developer Catalog*.

In the *Developer* perspective of the web console, you can use the *Helm* page to:

* Create Helm Releases and Repositories using the *Create* button.

* Create, update, or delete a cluster-scoped or namespace-scoped Helm chart repository.

* View the list of the existing Helm chart repositories in the Repositories tab, which can also be easily distinguished as either cluster scoped or namespace scoped.
