Application developers need access to backing services to build and connect workloads. Connecting workloads to backing services is always a challenge because each service provider requires a different way to access their secrets and consume them in a workload.

The {servicebinding-title} enables application developers to easily bind workloads together with operator-managed backing services, without any manual procedures to configure the binding connection. For the {servicebinding-title} to provide the binding data, as an Operator provider or user who creates backing services, you must expose the binding data to be automatically detected by the {servicebinding-title}. Then, the {servicebinding-title} automatically collects the binding data from the backing service and shares it with a workload to provide a consistent and predictable experience.
