The {servicebinding-title} manages the data plane for workloads and backing services. This guide provides instructions with examples to help you create a database instance, deploy an application, and use the {servicebinding-title} to create a binding connection between the application and the database service.

// Prerequisites for getting started with Service Binding Operator
[discrete]
== Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.
* You have installed the `oc` CLI.
* You have installed {servicebinding-title} from OperatorHub.
* You have installed the 5.1.2 version of the Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes Operator from OperatorHub using the *v5* Update channel. The installed Operator is available in an appropriate namespace, such as the `my-petclinic` namespace.
