[role="_abstract"]
In addition to grouping multiple components within an application, you can also use the *Topology* view to connect components with each other. You can either use a binding connector or a visual one to connect components.

A binding connection between the components can be established only if the target node is an Operator-backed service. This is indicated by the *Create a binding connector* tool-tip which appears when you drag an arrow to such a target node. When an application is connected to a service using a binding connector a `ServiceBinding` resource is created. Then, the Service Binding Operator controller projects the necessary binding data into the application deployment. After the request is successful, the application is redeployed establishing an interaction between the connected components.

A visual connector establishes only a visual connection between the components, depicting an intent to connect. No interaction between the components is established. If the target node is not an Operator-backed service the *Create a visual connector* tool-tip is displayed when you drag an arrow to a target node.

== Interacting with service binding from a Topology view
The *Developer* perspective helps in identifying the successful or unsuccessful service binding in the ServiceBinding resources through the *Topology* view: 

* Successful service binding
+
When a service binding is successful, by clicking on the binding connector, you can view the *Connected* status in the service binding side panel -> *Details* tab. You can also view the *Connected* status in the *Developer* perspective: 
+
** The *ServiceBindings* page. 
** *ServiceBindings* -> *ServiceBinding details* page. In addition, the title displays a *Connected* badge.
+
* Unsuccessful service binding
+
When a service binding is unsuccessful, the binding connector shows a red arrowhead and a red cross in the middle of the connection. By clicking on this connector, you can view the *Error* status and a tooltip on clicking the *Error* badge, in the service binding side panel -> *Details* tab. The tooltip gives you specific information about the underlying problem. You can also view the *Error* status and a tooltip on clicking the *Error* badge in the *Developer* perspective:
+
** The *ServiceBindings* page.
** *ServiceBindings* -> *ServiceBinding details* page. In addition, the title displays a *Error* badge.
+
[NOTE]
====
In the *ServiceBindings* page, you can use the *Filter* dropdown to list the successful and unsuccessful service bindings.

== Creating a visual connection between components
You can depict an intent to connect application components using the visual connector.

This procedure walks you through an example of creating a visual connection between a PostgreSQL Database service and a Spring PetClinic sample application.

.Prerequisites

* You have created and deployed a Spring PetClinic sample application using the *Developer* perspective.
* You have created and deployed a Crunchy PostgreSQL database instance using the *Developer* perspective. This instance has the following four components: `hippo-backup`, `hippo-instance`, `hippo-repo-host`, and  `hippo-pgbouncer`.

.Procedure

. Hover over the Spring PetClinic sample application to see a dangling arrow on the node.

.Visual connector

. Click and drag the arrow towards the `hippo-pgbouncer` deployment to connect the Spring PetClinic sample application with it.
. Click the `spring-petclinic` deployment to see the *Overview* panel. Under the *Details* tab, click the edit icon in the *Annotations* section to see the *Key = `app.openshift.io/connects-to`* and *Value = `[{"apiVersion":"apps/v1","kind":"Deployment","name":"hippo-pgbouncer"}]`* annotation added to the deployment.

Similarly you can create other applications and components and establish visual connections between them.

== Creating a binding connection between components
You can establish a binding connection with Operator-backed components.

This procedure walks through an example of creating a binding connection between a PostgreSQL Database service and a Spring PetClinic sample application. To create a binding connection with a service that is backed by the PostgreSQL Database Operator, you must first add the Red Hat-provided PostgreSQL Database Operator to the *OperatorHub*, and then install the Operator.
The PostreSQL Database Operator then creates and manages the `Database` resource, which exposes the binding information in secrets, config maps, status, and spec attributes.

.Prerequisites
* You have created and deployed a Spring PetClinic sample application using the *Developer* perspective.
* You have installed the {servicebinding-title} from the OperatorHub.
* You have installed the *Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes* Operator from the OperatorHub using `v5` *Update* channel.
* You have created and deployed a Crunchy PostgreSQL database instance using the *Developer* perspective. This instance has the following four components: `hippo-backup`, `hippo-instance`, `hippo-repo-host`, and `hippo-pgbouncer`.

.Procedure
. Switch to the *Developer* perspective and ensure that you are in the appropriate project, for example, `my-petclinic`. In the *Topology* view, hover over the Spring PetClinic sample application to see a dangling arrow on the node.
. Click and drag the arrow towards the *hippo* database in the Postgres Cluster to make a binding connection with the Spring PetClinic sample application. A *Create Service Binding* dialog box appears.
.. Enter the name and click *Create*.

Alternatively, in the *+Add* view, click the *YAML* option to see the *Import YAML* screen. Use the YAML editor and add the `ServiceBinding` resource:

[source,YAML]
----
apiVersion: binding.operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
    name: spring-petclinic-pgcluster
    namespace: my-petclinic
spec:
    services:
    - group: postgres-operator.crunchydata.com
      version: v1beta1
      kind: PostgresCluster
      name: hippo
    application:
      name: spring-petclinic
      group: apps
      version: v1
      resource: deployments
----

A service binding request is created and the {servicebinding-title} controller projects the database service connection information into the application deployment as files using a volume mount. After the request is successful, the application is redeployed and the connection is established.

[NOTE]
====
You can also use the context menu by dragging the dangling arrow to add and create a binding connection to an operator-backed service.
