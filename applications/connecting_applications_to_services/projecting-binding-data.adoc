This section provides information on how you can consume the binding data.

== Consumption of binding data
After the backing service exposes the binding data, for a workload to access and consume this data, you must project it into the workload from a backing service. {servicebinding-title} automatically projects this set of data into the workload in the following methods:

. By default, as files.
. As environment variables, after you configure the `.spec.bindAsFiles` parameter from the `ServiceBinding` resource.
