Application developers need access to backing services to build and connect workloads. Connecting workloads to backing services is always a challenge as each service provider suggests a different way to access their secrets and consume them in a workload.

{servicebinding-title} Operator enables application developers to easily bind workloads together with operator-managed backing services, without any manual procedures to configure the binding connection. For the Service Binding Operator to provide the binding metadata, as an Operator provider or user who creates backing services, you must expose the binding metadata to be automatically detected by the Service Binding Operator. Then, the Service Binding Operator automatically collects the binding metadata from the backing service and shares it with a workload providing a consistent and predictable experience.
