toc::[]

Over time, API objects created in {product-title} can accumulate in the
cluster's etcd data store through normal user operations, such as when building
and deploying applications.

Cluster administrators can periodically prune older versions of objects from the
cluster that are no longer required. For example, by pruning images you can delete
older images and layers that are no longer in use, but are still taking up disk
space.
