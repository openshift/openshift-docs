toc::[]

A _deployment strategy_ is a way to change or upgrade an application. The aim
is to make the change without downtime in a way that the user barely notices the
improvements.

Because the end user usually accesses the application through a route handled by
a router, the deployment strategy can focus on DeploymentConfig features or
routing features. Strategies that focus on the DeploymentConfig impact all
routes that use the application. Strategies that use router features target
individual routes.

Many deployment strategies are supported through the DeploymentConfig, and some
additional strategies are supported through router features. DeploymentConfig
strategies are discussed in this section.

*Choosing a deployment strategy*

Consider the following when choosing a deployment strategy:

- Long-running connections must be handled gracefully.
- Database conversions can be complex and must be done and rolled back along with
the application.
- If the application is a hybrid of microservices and traditional components,
downtime might be required to complete the transition.
- You must have the infrastructure to do this.
- If you have a non-isolated test environment, you can break both new and old
versions.

A deployment strategy uses readiness checks to determine if a new Pod is ready
for use. If a readiness check fails, the DeploymentConfig retries to run the
Pod until it times out. The default timeout is `10m`, a value set in
`TimeoutSeconds` in `dc.spec.strategy.*params`.
