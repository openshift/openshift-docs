_Deployments_ and _DeploymentConfigs_ in {product-title} are API objects that
provide two similar but different methods for fine-grained management over
common user applications. They are composed of the following separate API
objects:

- A DeploymentConfig or a Deployment, either of which describes the desired state
of a particular component of the application as a Pod template.
- DeploymentConfigs involve one or more _ReplicationControllers_, which contain a
point-in-time record of the state of a DeploymentConfig as a Pod template.
Similarly, Deployments involve one or more _ReplicaSets_, a successor of
ReplicationControllers.
- One or more Pods, which represent an instance of a particular version of an
application.

== Building blocks of a deployment

Deployments and DeploymentConfigs are enabled by the use of native Kubernetes
API objects ReplicaSets and ReplicationControllers, respectively, as their
building blocks.

Users do not have to manipulate ReplicationControllers, ReplicaSets, or Pods
owned by DeploymentConfigs or Deployments. The deployment systems ensures
changes are propagated appropriately.

[TIP]
====
If the existing deployment strategies are not suited for your use case and you
must run manual steps during the lifecycle of your deployment, then
you should consider creating a Custom deployment strategy.
