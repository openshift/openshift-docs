{product-title} cluster administrators can use link:https://marketplace.redhat.com/en-us/documentation/getting-started
[Red Hat Marketplace] to manage software on {product-title}, provide developers with self-service access to deploy application instances, and correlate application usage against a quota.

== Connecting {product-title} clusters to the Marketplace

You can install a common set of applications on {product-title} clusters that you connect to the Marketplace. You can also use the Marketplace to track cluster usage against your subscriptions or quota. Additional users can be added through the Marketplace for the Procurement department to access this data.

A Marketplace Operator is installed to install the image registry secret, manage the on-cluster catalog and report application usage during the link:https://marketplace.redhat.com/en-us/documentation/clusters[cluster connection process].

== Installing applications

Cluster administrators can browse and link:https://marketplace.redhat.com/en-us/documentation/operators[install Marketplace applications] from within OperatorHub in {product-title} or at the link:https://marketplace.redhat.com[Marketplace web application].

After applications are installed, access them in the web console under *Installed Operators*.

== Deploying an instance of an application

Applications that you install from the Marketplace can be used in the Administrator and Developer perspectives of the web console.

=== Using the Developer perspective

Developers using the {product-title} cluster don’t have to concern themselves with Operator installation or usage tracking of applications. Newly installed capabilities are immediately available for use within the Developer perspective’s catalog. 

For example, once a database Operator is installed, a developer can create an instance from the catalog within their Project. Usage of the database is collected and reported in aggregate to the cluster administrator.

=== Using the Administrator perspective

{product-title} users can launch applications instances by browsing available CRDs within the *Installed Operators* list.
