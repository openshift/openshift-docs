== Installing Operators from the OperatorHub

As a cluster administrator, you can install an Operator from the OperatorHub
using the {product-title} web console or the CLI. You can then subscribe the
Operator to one or more namespaces to make it available for developers on your
cluster.

During installation, you must determine the following initial settings for the
Operator:

Target Namespace:: A list of OperatorGroup namespaces are presented for you to
choose where the installed Operator will be available. This example chooses
*global-operators* to make the Operator available to all users and projects.

Update Channel:: If an Operator is available through multiple channels, you can
choose which channel you want to subscribe to. For example, to deploy from the
*stable* channel, select it from the *Update Channel* drop-down list.

Update Strategy:: You can choose Automatic or Manual updates. If you choose
Automatic updates for an installed Operator, when a new version of that Operator
is available, the OLM automatically upgrades the running instance of your
Operator without human intervention. If you select Manual updates, when a newer
version of an Operator is available, the OLM creates an update request. As a
cluster administrator, you must then manually approve that update request to
have the Operator updated to the new version.
