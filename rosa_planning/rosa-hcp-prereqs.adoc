= AWS prerequisites for {hcp-title}

toc::[]

{hcp-title-first} provides a model that Red Hat hosts the control plane and uses your AWS account to deploy clusters.

Ensure that the following AWS prerequisites are met before installing ROSA with STS.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you create a ROSA cluster using AWS STS, an associated AWS OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider is created as well. This OIDC provider configuration relies on a public key that is located in the `us-east-1` AWS region. Customers with AWS SCPs must allow the use of the `us-east-1` AWS region, even if these clusters are deployed in a different region.

== Customer requirements when using STS for deployment

The following prerequisites must be complete before you deploy a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster that uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS).

== Red Hat managed IAM references for AWS

With the STS deployment model, Red Hat is no longer responsible for creating and managing Amazon Web Services (AWS) IAM policies, IAM users, or IAM roles. For information on creating these roles and policies, see the following sections on IAM roles.

* To use the `ocm` CLI, you must have an `ocm-role` and `user-role` resource. See xref:../rosa_planning/rosa-sts-ocm-role.adoc#rosa-sts-ocm-role[OpenShift Cluster Manager IAM role resources].
* If you have a single cluster, see xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa-sts-about-iam-resources.adoc#rosa-sts-account-wide-roles-and-policies_rosa-sts-about-iam-resources[Account-wide IAM role and policy reference].
* For every cluster, you must have the necessary operator roles. See xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa-sts-about-iam-resources.adoc#rosa-sts-operator-roles_rosa-sts-about-iam-resources[Cluster-specific Operator IAM role reference].
