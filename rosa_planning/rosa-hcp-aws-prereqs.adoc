{rosa-title} provides a model that allows Red{nbsp}Hat to deploy clusters into a customer's existing Amazon Web Service (AWS) account.

Ensure that the following prerequisites are met before installing your cluster.

[id="rosa-hcp-customer-requirements_{context}"]
== Customer requirements for all {rosa-short} clusters

The following prerequisites must be complete before you deploy a {rosa-short} cluster.

== Requirements for using {cluster-manager}

The following configuration details are required only if you use {cluster-manager-url} to manage your clusters. If you use the CLI tools exclusively, then you can disregard these requirements.

//TODO OSDOCS-11789: when are ocm-role and user-role actually created? Pretty sure this happens as part of the cluster install process, so doesn't need to be done ahead of time??

== Red{nbsp}Hat managed IAM references for AWS

Red{nbsp}Hat is not responsible for creating and managing Amazon Web Services (AWS) IAM policies, IAM users, or IAM roles. For information on creating these roles and policies, see the following sections on IAM roles.

* To use the `ocm` CLI, you must have an `ocm-role` and `user-role` resource.
See xref:../rosa_planning/rosa-hcp-prepare-iam-roles-resources.adoc#rosa-prepare-iam-resources-roles-ocm[Required IAM roles and resources].
* If you have a single cluster, see xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa-sts-about-iam-resources.adoc#rosa-sts-account-wide-roles-and-policies_rosa-sts-about-iam-resources[Account-wide IAM role and policy reference].
* For each cluster, you must have the necessary Operator roles. See xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa-sts-about-iam-resources.adoc#rosa-sts-operator-roles_rosa-sts-about-iam-resources[Cluster-specific Operator IAM role reference].
