== Red{nbsp}Hat managed IAM references for AWS

When you use STS as your cluster credential method, Red{nbsp}Hat is not responsible for creating and managing Amazon Web Services (AWS) IAM policies, IAM users, or IAM roles. For information on creating these roles and policies, see the following sections on IAM roles.

* To use the `ocm` CLI, you must have an `ocm-role` and `user-role` resource. See xref:../rosa_planning/rosa-sts-ocm-role.adoc#rosa-sts-ocm-role[OpenShift Cluster Manager IAM role resources].
* If you have a single cluster, see xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa-sts-about-iam-resources.adoc#rosa-sts-account-wide-roles-and-policies_rosa-sts-about-iam-resources[Account-wide IAM role and policy reference].
* For each cluster, you must have the necessary operator roles. See xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa-sts-about-iam-resources.adoc#rosa-sts-operator-roles_rosa-sts-about-iam-resources[Cluster-specific Operator IAM role reference].

=== AWS firewall prerequisites

If you are using a firewall to control egress traffic from your {product-title}, you must configure your firewall to grant access to the certain domain and port combinations below. {product-title} requires this access to provide a fully managed OpenShift service.
