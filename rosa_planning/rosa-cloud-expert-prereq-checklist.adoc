//TODO OSDOCS-11789: Consider adding the following to a subsection about the initiating/control machine, along with CLI sections?
The machine that you run the installation process from must have access to the following:

* Amazon Web Services API and authentication service endpoints
* Red Hat OpenShift API and authentication service endpoints (`api.openshift.com` and `sso.redhat.com`)
* Internet connectivity to obtain installation artifacts

//TODO OSDOCS-11789: This needs to be accessible from parts of the cluster, but not the deploying machine - omit entirely, or leave in place for Classic?
ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
Starting with version 1.2.7 of the ROSA CLI, all OIDC provider endpoint URLs on new clusters use Amazon CloudFront and the link:http://oidc.op1.openshiftapps.com/[oidc.op1.openshiftapps.com] domain. This change improves access speed, reduces latency, and improves resiliency for new clusters created with the ROSA CLI 1.2.7 or later. There are no supported migration paths for existing OIDC provider configurations.
====
endif::openshift-rosa[]

//TODO OSDOCS-11789: Consider combining with other account and permission needs to avoid duplication of headers? This does need to happen to download the CLIs though.
== Accounts and permissions

Ensure that you have the following accounts, credentials, and permissions.

=== AWS account

* Create an AWS account if you do not already have one.
* Gather the credentials required to log in to your AWS account.
* Ensure that your AWS account has sufficient permissions to use the ROSA CLI: xref:../cli_reference/rosa_cli/rosa-cli-permission-examples.adoc#rosa-cli-permission-examples[Least privilege permissions for common ROSA CLI commands]
//OSDOCS-11789: Moving these here because it is a permission / account level enablement
* Enable ROSA for your AWS account on the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/rosa/[AWS console].
** If your account is the management account for your organization (used for AWS billing purposes), you must have `aws-marketplace:Subscribe` permissions available on your account. See _Service control policy (SCP) prerequisites_ for more information, or see the AWS documentation for troubleshooting: link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rosa/latest/userguide/security-iam-troubleshoot.html#error-aws-orgs-scp-denies-permissions[AWS Organizations service control policy denies required AWS Marketplace permissions].

=== Red{nbsp}Hat account

//TODO OSDOCS-11789: Do we need to mention RH Organization here also?
* Create a Red Hat account for the link:https://console.redhat.com/[{hybrid-console}] if you do not already have one.
* Gather the credentials required to log in to your Red Hat account.

== CLI requirements

You need to download and install several CLI (command line interface) tools to be able to deploy a cluster.

=== AWS CLI (`aws`)

. Install the link:https://aws.amazon.com/cli/[AWS Command Line Interface].
. Log in to your AWS account using the AWS CLI: link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/command-line-sign-in.html[Sign in through the AWS CLI]
. Verify your account identity:
+
[source,terminal]
----
 $ aws sts get-caller-identity
----
. Check whether the service role for ELB (Elastic Load Balancing) exists:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws iam get-role --role-name "AWSServiceRoleForElasticLoadBalancing"
----
+
If the role does not exist, create it by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name "elasticloadbalancing.amazonaws.com"
----

=== ROSA CLI (`rosa`)

. Install the ROSA CLI from the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads#tool-rosa[web console].
ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
See xref:../rosa_install_access_delete_clusters/rosa_getting_started_iam/rosa-installing-rosa.adoc[Installing the Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) CLI, rosa] for detailed instructions.
endif::openshift-rosa[]
. Log in to your Red Hat account by running `rosa login` and following the instructions in the command output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa login
To login to your Red Hat account, get an offline access token at https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token/rosa
? Copy the token and paste it here: 
----
+
Alternatively, you can copy the full `$ rosa login --token=abc...` command and paste that in the terminal:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa login --token=<abc..>
----
. Confirm you are logged in using the correct account and credentials:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa whoami
----

=== OpenShift CLI (`oc`)

The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) is not required to deploy a {product-title} cluster, but is a useful tool for interacting with your cluster after it is deployed.

. Download and install`oc` from the {cluster-manager} link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads#tool-oc[Command-line interface (CLI) tools] page, or follow the instructions in xref:../cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.adoc#cli-getting-started[Getting started with the OpenShift CLI].
. Verify that the OpenShift CLI has been installed correctly by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa verify openshift-client
----

//TODO OSDOCS-11789: Moved quota check to the point where it is actually useful - yes, this is checked during install, but it's also worth checking ahead of time so that any issues are known during preparation rather than deployment.
== AWS infrastructure prerequisites

* Optionally, ensure that your AWS account has sufficient quota available to deploy a cluster.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa verify quota
----
+
This command only checks the total quota allocated to your account; it does not reflect the amount of quota already consumed from that quota. Running this command is optional because your quota is verified during cluster deployment. However, Red Hat recommends running this command to confirm your quota ahead of time so that deployment is not interrupted by issues with quota availability.
ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
* For more information about resources provisioned during ROSA cluster deployment, see xref:../rosa_planning/rosa-sts-aws-prereqs.adoc#rosa-aws-policy-provisioned_rosa-sts-aws-prereqs[Provisioned AWS Infrastructure].
* For more information about the required AWS service quotas, see xref:../rosa_planning/rosa-sts-required-aws-service-quotas.adoc#rosa-sts-required-aws-service-quotas[Required AWS service quotas].
endif::openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
* For more information about resources provisioned during ROSA cluster deployment, see xref:../rosa_planning/rosa-sts-aws-prereqs.adoc#rosa-aws-policy-provisioned_rosa-hcp-prereqs[Provisioned AWS Infrastructure].

endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]

== Service Control Policy (SCP) prerequisites

ROSA clusters are hosted in an AWS account within an AWS organizational unit. A link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html[service control policy (SCP)] is created and applied to the AWS organizational unit that manages what services the AWS sub-accounts are permitted to access.

* Ensure that your organization's SCPs are not more restrictive than the roles and policies required by the cluster. For more information, see the xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa-sts-about-iam-resources.adoc#rosa-minimum-scp_rosa-sts-about-iam-resources[Minimum set of effective permissions for SCPs].
* When you create a ROSA cluster, an associated AWS OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider is created.

== Networking prerequisites

Prerequisites needed from a networking standpoint.

include::modules/mos-network-prereqs-min-bandwidth.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

=== Firewall

//TODO OSDOCS-11789: Are these things that your cluster needs access to, or your deploying machine needs access to?
* Configure your firewall to allow access to the domains and ports listed in
ifdef::openshift-rosa[]

endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]

//Moving up prereqs that are actually required for deployment
ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
== VPC requirements for PrivateLink clusters

If you choose to deploy a PrivateLink cluster, then be sure to deploy the cluster in the pre-existing BYO VPC:

* Create a public and private subnet for each AZ that your cluster uses.
** Alternatively, implement transit gateway for internet and egress with appropriate routes.
* The VPC's CIDR block must contain the `Networking.MachineCIDR` range, which is the IP address for cluster machines.
** The subnet CIDR blocks must belong to the machine CIDR that you specify.
* Set both `enableDnsHostnames` and `enableDnsSupport` to `true`.
** That way, the cluster can use the Route 53 zones that are attached to the VPC to resolve cluster internal DNS records.
* Verify route tables by running:
+
[source,terminal]
 ----
 $ aws ec2 describe-route-tables --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=<vpc-id>"
 ----

** Ensure that the cluster can egress either through NAT gateway in public subnet or through transit gateway.
** Ensure whatever UDR you would like to follow is set up.
* You can also configure a cluster-wide proxy during or after install.
xref:../networking/configuring-cluster-wide-proxy.adoc#configuring-cluster-wide-proxy[Configuring a cluster-wide proxy] for more details.

[NOTE]
====
You can install a non-PrivateLink ROSA cluster in a pre-existing BYO VPC.
====
endif::openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
=== Create VPC before cluster deployment

{hcp-title} clusters must be deployed into an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

include::snippets/rosa-existing-vpc-requirements.adoc[leveloffset=+0]

//TODO OSDOCS-11789: Does the following section need to be moved into this document only?
// Is it reasonable to include it in preparation and in deployment process?
// https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_hcp/rosa-hcp-sts-creating-a-cluster-quickly.html#rosa-hcp-prereqs

//TODO OSDOCS-11789: We also link out into https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.17/installing/installing_aws/ipi/installing-aws-vpc.html#installation-custom-aws-vpc_installing-aws-vpc for more information about what your VPC should be able to handle, but this needs review to omit OCP-only content if we're going to use it.
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]

=== Additional custom security groups

During cluster creation, you can add additional custom security groups to a cluster that has an existing non-managed VPC. To do so, complete these prerequisites before you create the cluster:

* Create the custom security groups in AWS before you create the cluster.
* Associate the custom security groups with the VPC that you are using to create the cluster. Do not associate the custom security groups with any other VPC.
* You may need to request additional AWS quota for `Security groups per network interface`.

ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
For more details see the detailed requirements for xref:../rosa_install_access_delete_clusters/rosa_getting_started_iam/rosa-aws-prereqs.adoc#rosa-security-groups_prerequisites[Security groups].
endif::openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
For more details see the detailed requirements for xref:../rosa_planning/rosa-sts-aws-prereqs.adoc#rosa-security-groups_rosa-hcp-prereqs[Security groups].
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]

=== Custom DNS and domains

You can configure a custom domain name server and custom domain name for your cluster. To do so, complete the following prerequisites before you create the cluster:

//TODO OSDOCS-11789: Needs verification from mmcneill
* By default, ROSA clusters require you to set the `domain name servers` option to `AmazonProvidedDNS` to ensure successful cluster creation and operation.
* To use a custom DNS server and domain name for your cluster, the ROSA installer must be able to use VPC DNS with default DHCP options so that it can resolve internal IPs and services. This means that you must create a custom DHCP option set to forward DNS lookups to your DNS server, and associate this option set with your VPC before you create the cluster.
ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
For more information, see xref:../cloud_experts_tutorials/cloud-experts-custom-dns-resolver.adoc#cloud-experts-custom-dns-resolver[Deploying ROSA with a custom DNS resolver].
endif::openshift-rosa[]
* Confirm that your VPC is using VPC Resolver by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws ec2 describe-dhcp-options
----
