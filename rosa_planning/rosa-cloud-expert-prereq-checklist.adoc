This is a checklist of prerequisites needed to create a {product-title} (ROSA) classic cluster with link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html[STS].

[NOTE]
====
This is a high level checklist and your implementation can vary.
====

Before running the installation process, verify that you deploy this from a machine that has access to:

* The API services for the cloud to which you provision.
* Access to `api.openshift.com` and `sso.redhat.com`.
* The hosts on the network that you provision.
* The internet to obtain installation media.

== Accounts and CLIs Prerequisites

Accounts and CLIs you must install to deploy the cluster.

=== AWS account

* Gather the following details:
** AWS IAM User
** AWS Access Key ID
** AWS Secret Access Key
* Ensure that you have the right permissions as detailed link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ROSA/latest/userguide/security-iam-awsmanpol.html[AWS managed IAM policies for ROSA] and xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa-sts-about-iam-resources.html[About IAM resources for ROSA clusters that use STS].
* See xref:../rosa_planning/rosa-sts-aws-prereqs.html#rosa-account_rosa-sts-aws-prereqs[Account] for more details.

=== AWS CLI (`aws`)

* Install from link:https://aws.amazon.com/cli/[AWS Command Line Interface] if you have not already.
* Configure the CLI:
+
. Enter `aws configure` in the terminal:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws configure
----
+
. Enter the AWS Access Key ID and press *enter*.
. Enter the AWS Secret Access Key and press *enter*.
. Enter the default region you want to deploy into.
. Enter the output format you want, “table” or “json”.
. Verify the output by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
 $ aws sts get-caller-identity
----
+
. Ensure that the service role for ELB already exists by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws iam get-role --role-name "AWSServiceRoleForElasticLoadBalancing"
----
+
.. If it does not exist, run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name "elasticloadbalancing.amazonaws.com"
----

=== Red Hat account

* Create a link:https://console.redhat.com/[{hybrid-console}]  account if you have not already.

=== ROSA CLI (`rosa`)

. Enable ROSA from your AWS account on the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/rosa/[AWS console] if you have not already.
. Install the CLI from xref:../rosa_install_access_delete_clusters/rosa_getting_started_iam/rosa-installing-rosa.html[Installing the Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) CLI, rosa] or from the OpenShift console link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads#tool-rosa[AWS console].
. Enter `rosa login` in a terminal, and this will prompt you to go to the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token/rosa[token page] through the console:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa login
----
+
. Log in with your Red Hat account credentials.
. Click the *Load token* button.
. Copy the token and paste it back into the CLI prompt and press *enter*.
+
* Alternatively, you can copy the full `$ rosa login --token=abc...` command and paste that in the terminal:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa login --token=<abc..>
----
+
. Verify your credentials by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa whoami
----
+
. Ensure you have sufficient quota by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa verify quota
----
+
* See xref:../rosa_planning/rosa-sts-aws-prereqs.html#rosa-aws-policy-provisioned_rosa-sts-aws-prereqs[Provisioned AWS Infrastructure] for more details on AWS services provisioned for ROSA cluster.
* See xref:../rosa_planning/rosa-sts-required-aws-service-quotas.adoc#rosa-sts-required-aws-service-quotas[Required AWS service quotas] for more details on AWS services quota.


=== OpenShift CLI (`oc`)

. Install from xref:../cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.adoc#cli-getting-started[Getting started with the OpenShift CLI] or from the OpenShift console link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads#tool-oc[Command-line interface (CLI) tools].
. Verify that the OpenShift CLI has been installed correctly by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa verify openshift-client
----

Once you have the above prerequisites installed and enabled, proceed to the next steps.


== SCP Prerequisites

ROSA clusters are hosted in an AWS account within an AWS organizational unit. A link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html[service control policy (SCP)] is created and applied to the AWS organizational unit that manages what services the AWS sub-accounts are permitted to access.

* Ensure that your organization's SCPs are not more restrictive than the roles and policies required by the cluster.
* Ensure that your SCP is configured to allow the required `aws-marketplace:Subscribe` permission when you choose *Enable ROSA* from the console, and see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ROSA/latest/userguide/troubleshoot-rosa-enablement.html#error-aws-orgs-scp-denies-permissions[AWS Organizations service control policy (SCP) is denying required AWS Marketplace permissions] for more details.
* When you create a ROSA classic cluster, an associated AWS OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider is created.
** This OIDC provider configuration relies on a public key that is located in the `us-east-1` AWS region.
** Customers with AWS SCPs must allow the use of the `us-east-1` AWS region, even if these clusters are deployed in a different region.

== Networking Prerequisites

Prerequisites needed from a networking standpoint.

=== Firewall

* Configure your firewall to allow access to the domains and ports listed in xref:../rosa_planning/rosa-sts-aws-prereqs.adoc#osd-aws-privatelink-firewall-prerequisites_rosa-sts-aws-prereqs[AWS firewall prerequisites].

=== Additional custom security groups

When you create a cluster using an existing non-managed VPC, you can add additional custom security groups during cluster creation. Complete these prerequisites before you create the cluster:

* Create the custom security groups in AWS before you create the cluster.
* Associate the custom security groups with the VPC that you are using to create the cluster. Do not associate the custom security groups with any other VPC.
* You may need to request additional AWS quota for `Security groups per network interface`.

For more details see the detailed requirements for xref:../rosa_install_access_delete_clusters/rosa_getting_started_iam/rosa-aws-prereqs.adoc#rosa-security-groups_prerequisites[Security groups].

=== Custom DNS

* If you want to use custom DNS, then the ROSA installer must be able to use VPC DNS with default DHCP options so it can resolve hosts locally.
** To do so, run `aws ec2 describe-dhcp-options` and see if the VPC is using VPC Resolver:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws ec2 describe-dhcp-options
----
+
* Otherwise, the upstream DNS will need to forward the cluster scope to this VPC so the cluster can resolve internal IPs and services.

== PrivateLink Prerequisites

If you choose to deploy a PrivateLink cluster, then be sure to deploy the cluster in the pre-existing BYO VPC:

* Create a public and private subnet for each AZ that your cluster uses.
** Alternatively, implement transit gateway for internet and egress with appropriate routes.
* The VPC's CIDR block must contain the `Networking.MachineCIDR` range, which is the IP address for cluster machines.
** The subnet CIDR blocks must belong to the machine CIDR that you specify.
* Set both `enableDnsHostnames` and `enableDnsSupport` to `true`.
** That way, the cluster can use the Route 53 zones that are attached to the VPC to resolve cluster internal DNS records.
* Verify route tables by running:
+
[source,terminal]
 ----
 $ aws ec2 describe-route-tables --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=<vpc-id>"
 ----

** Ensure that the cluster can egress either through NAT gateway in public subnet or through transit gateway.
** Ensure whatever UDR you would like to follow is set up.
* You can also configure a cluster-wide proxy during or after install.
xref:../networking/configuring-cluster-wide-proxy.adoc#configuring-cluster-wide-proxy[Configuring a cluster-wide proxy] for more details.

[NOTE]
====
You can install a non-PrivateLink ROSA cluster in a pre-existing BYO VPC.
