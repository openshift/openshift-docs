This is a checklist of prerequisites needed to create a {product-title} (ROSA) classic cluster with link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html[STS].

[NOTE]
====
This is a high level checklist and your implementation can vary.
====

Before running the installation process, verify that you deploy this from a machine that has access to:

* The API services for the cloud to which you provision.
* Access to `api.openshift.com`, `oidc.op1.openshiftapps.com`, and `sso.redhat.com`.
* The hosts on the network that you provision.
* The internet to obtain installation media.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Starting with version 1.2.7 of the ROSA CLI, all OIDC provider endpoint URLs on new clusters use Amazon CloudFront and the link:http://oidc.op1.openshiftapps.com/[oidc.op1.openshiftapps.com] domain. This change improves access speed, reduces latency, and improves resiliency for new clusters created with the ROSA CLI 1.2.7 or later. There are no supported migration paths for existing OIDC provider configurations.

== Accounts and CLIs Prerequisites

Accounts and CLIs you must install to deploy the cluster.

=== AWS account

* Gather the following details:
** AWS IAM User
** AWS Access Key ID
** AWS Secret Access Key
* Ensure that you have the right permissions as detailed link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ROSA/latest/userguide/security-iam-awsmanpol.html[AWS managed IAM policies for ROSA] and xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa-sts-about-iam-resources.html[About IAM resources for ROSA clusters that use STS].
* See xref:../rosa_planning/rosa-sts-aws-prereqs.html#rosa-account_rosa-sts-aws-prereqs[Account] for more details.

=== AWS CLI (`aws`)

* Install from link:https://aws.amazon.com/cli/[AWS Command Line Interface] if you have not already.
* Configure the CLI:
+
. Enter `aws configure` in the terminal:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws configure
----
+
. Enter the AWS Access Key ID and press *enter*.
. Enter the AWS Secret Access Key and press *enter*.
. Enter the default region you want to deploy into.
. Enter the output format you want, “table” or “json”.
. Verify the output by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
 $ aws sts get-caller-identity
----
+
. Ensure that the service role for ELB already exists by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws iam get-role --role-name "AWSServiceRoleForElasticLoadBalancing"
----
+
.. If it does not exist, run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name "elasticloadbalancing.amazonaws.com"
----

=== Red{nbsp}Hat account

* Create a link:https://console.redhat.com/[{hybrid-console}]  account if you have not already.

=== ROSA CLI (`rosa`)

. Enable ROSA from your AWS account on the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/rosa/[AWS console] if you have not already.
. Install the CLI from xref:../rosa_install_access_delete_clusters/rosa_getting_started_iam/rosa-installing-rosa.html[Installing the Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) CLI, rosa] or from the OpenShift console link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads#tool-rosa[AWS console].
. Enter `rosa login` in a terminal, and this will prompt you to go to the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token/rosa[token page] through the console:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa login
----
+
. Log in with your Red{nbsp}Hat account credentials.
. Click the *Load token* button.
. Copy the token and paste it back into the CLI prompt and press *enter*.
+
* Alternatively, you can copy the full `$ rosa login --token=abc...` command and paste that in the terminal:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa login --token=<abc..>
----
+
. Verify your credentials by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa whoami
----
+
. Ensure you have sufficient quota by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa verify quota
----
+
* See xref:../rosa_planning/rosa-sts-aws-prereqs.html#rosa-aws-policy-provisioned_rosa-sts-aws-prereqs[Provisioned AWS Infrastructure] for more details on AWS services provisioned for ROSA cluster.
* See xref:../rosa_planning/rosa-sts-required-aws-service-quotas.adoc#rosa-sts-required-aws-service-quotas[Required AWS service quotas] for more details on AWS services quota.


=== OpenShift CLI (`oc`)

. Install from xref:../cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.adoc#cli-getting-started[Getting started with the OpenShift CLI] or from the OpenShift console link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads#tool-oc[Command-line interface (CLI) tools].
. Verify that the OpenShift CLI has been installed correctly by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa verify openshift-client
----

Once you have the above prerequisites installed and enabled, proceed to the next steps.


== SCP Prerequisites

ROSA clusters are hosted in an AWS account within an AWS organizational unit. A link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html[service control policy (SCP)] is created and applied to the AWS organizational unit that manages what services the AWS sub-accounts are permitted to access.

* Ensure that your organization's SCPs are not more restrictive than the roles and policies required by the cluster.
* Ensure that your SCP is configured to allow the required `aws-marketplace:Subscribe` permission when you choose *Enable ROSA* from the console, and see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ROSA/latest/userguide/troubleshoot-rosa-enablement.html#error-aws-orgs-scp-denies-permissions[AWS Organizations service control policy (SCP) is denying required AWS Marketplace permissions] for more details.
* When you create a ROSA classic cluster, an associated AWS OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider is created.
** This OIDC provider configuration relies on a public key that is located in the `us-east-1` AWS region.
** Customers with AWS SCPs must allow the use of the `us-east-1` AWS region, even if these clusters are deployed in a different region.

== Networking Prerequisites

Prerequisites needed from a networking standpoint.

=== Firewall

* Configure your firewall to allow access to the domains and ports listed in xref:../rosa_planning/rosa-sts-aws-prereqs.adoc#osd-aws-privatelink-firewall-prerequisites_rosa-sts-aws-prereqs[AWS firewall prerequisites].

=== Additional custom security groups

When you create a cluster using an existing non-managed VPC, you can add additional custom security groups during cluster creation. Complete these prerequisites before you create the cluster:

* Create the custom security groups in AWS before you create the cluster.
* Associate the custom security groups with the VPC that you are using to create the cluster. Do not associate the custom security groups with any other VPC.
* You may need to request additional AWS quota for `Security groups per network interface`.

For more details see the detailed requirements for xref:../rosa_install_access_delete_clusters/rosa_getting_started_iam/rosa-aws-prereqs.adoc#rosa-security-groups_prerequisites[Security groups].

=== Custom DNS

* If you want to use custom DNS, then the ROSA installer must be able to use VPC DNS with default DHCP options so it can resolve hosts locally.
** To do so, run `aws ec2 describe-dhcp-options` and see if the VPC is using VPC Resolver:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws ec2 describe-dhcp-options
----
+
* Otherwise, the upstream DNS will need to forward the cluster scope to this VPC so the cluster can resolve internal IPs and services.

== PrivateLink Prerequisites

If you choose to deploy a PrivateLink cluster, then be sure to deploy the cluster in the pre-existing BYO VPC:

* Create a public and private subnet for each AZ that your cluster uses.
** Alternatively, implement transit gateway for internet and egress with appropriate routes.
* The VPC's CIDR block must contain the `Networking.MachineCIDR` range, which is the IP address for cluster machines.
** The subnet CIDR blocks must belong to the machine CIDR that you specify.
* Set both `enableDnsHostnames` and `enableDnsSupport` to `true`.
** That way, the cluster can use the Route 53 zones that are attached to the VPC to resolve cluster internal DNS records.
* Verify route tables by running:
+
[source,terminal]
 ----
 $ aws ec2 describe-route-tables --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=<vpc-id>"
 ----

** Ensure that the cluster can egress either through NAT gateway in public subnet or through transit gateway.
** Ensure whatever UDR you would like to follow is set up.
* You can also configure a cluster-wide proxy during or after install.
xref:../networking/configuring-cluster-wide-proxy.adoc#configuring-cluster-wide-proxy[Configuring a cluster-wide proxy] for more details.

[NOTE]
====
You can install a non-PrivateLink ROSA cluster in a pre-existing BYO VPC.
