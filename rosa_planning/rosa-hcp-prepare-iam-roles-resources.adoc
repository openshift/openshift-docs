You must create several role resources on your AWS account in order to create and manage a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster.

[id="rosa-prepare-am-resources-roles-account"]
== Roles required to create and manage clusters

Several account-wide roles (`account-roles` in the ROSA CLI) are required to create or manage ROSA clusters. These roles must be created using the ROSA CLI (`rosa`), regardless of whether you typically use {cluster-manager} or the ROSA CLI to create and manage your clusters. These roles only need to be created once, and do not need to be created for every cluster you install.

[id="rosa-prepare-am-resources-roles-operator"]
== Roles required to manage Operator features
//operator roles
//created per-cluster or per-OIDC provider if that is shared between clusters
Cluster-specific Operator roles (`operator-roles` in the ROSA CLI) obtain the temporary permissions required to perform cluster operations that are provided by Operators, such as managing back-end storage, ingress, and registry. These roles are required for every cluster, as several Operators are used to provide cluster features by default.

[id="rosa-prepare-iam-resources-oidc"]
=== Required OIDC authentication resources

{product-title} clusters use OIDC and the AWS Security Token Service (STS) to authenticate Operator access to AWS resources they require to perform their functions. Each production cluster requires its own OIDC configuration.

[id="rosa-prepare-iam-resources-roles-ocm"]
== Roles required to use {cluster-manager}

The roles in this section are only required when you want to use {cluster-manager} to create and manage clusters. If you intend to create and manage clusters using only the ROSA CLI (`rosa`) and the OpenShift CLI (`oc`), these roles are not required.
