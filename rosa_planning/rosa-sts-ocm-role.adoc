toc::[]

{product-title} (ROSA) web UI needs you to have some permissions on your AWS account that create a trust relationship to provide the end-user experience at {cluster-manager-url} and for the `rosa` command line interface (CLI).

This trust relationship is achieved through the creation and association of two AWS IAM roles:

1. `ocm-role`
2. `user-role`

If you use the `rosa` CLI, the `rosa` tool creates a number of these required permissions for you. This creation is available since your user account authenticates for both Red Hat and AWS. In the {cluster-manager} web UI, you need to create these roles.

[NOTE]
====
Role creation does not request your AWS access or secret keys. This is because it uses an AWS Security Token Service (STS) as the basis of its workflow.
