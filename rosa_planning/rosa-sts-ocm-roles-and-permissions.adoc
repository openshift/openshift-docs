= {cluster-manager} roles and permissions

When creating clusters, you need to have at least three roles created to create and use the clusters. These roles are:

* A user role
* A basic `ocm-role`
* An admin `ocm-role`

[id="rosa-sts-ocm-roles-and-permissions-iam-user-role_{context}"]
== User role

The user role has no additional permissions. {cluster-manager} identifies this user role and creates trust between this role, the Red Hat account, and the two `ocm-role` resources that you create.

//Used to identify the user by creating a trust between it, Red Hat account and the ocm role.

[id="rosa-sts-ocm-roles-and-permissions-iam-basic-role_{context}"]
== Creating basic {cluster-manager} permissions

You create a basic `ocm-role` by using the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
rosa create ocm-role
----

This command creates the role, prompting you for specifications for the role. The basic `ocm-role` contains the following permissions:

* iam:GetOpenIDConnectProvider
* iam:GetRole
* iam:ListRoles
* iam:ListRoleTags
* ec2:DescribeRegions
* ec2:DescribeRouteTables
* ec2:DescribeSubnets
* ec2:DescribeVpcs
* sts:AssumeRole
* sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity

[id="rosa-sts-ocm-roles-and-permissions-iam-admin-role__{context}"]
== Creating admin {cluster-manager} permissions

You create an administrator `ocm-role` by using the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
rosa create ocm-role --admin
----

This command creates the role, prompting you for specifications for the role. The admin `ocm-role` contains all of the permissions of the basic `ocm` role as well as

* iam:AttachRolePolicy
* iam:CreateOpenIDConnectProvider
* iam:CreateRole
* iam:ListPolicies
* iam:ListPolicyTags
* iam:PutRolePermissionsBoundary
* iam:TagRole
