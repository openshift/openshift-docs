You can use the *Developer* perspective of the {OCP} web console to create CI/CD pipelines for your software delivery process.

In the *Developer* perspective:

* Use the *Add* -> *Pipeline* -> *Pipeline builder* option to create customized pipelines for your application.
* Use the *Add* -> *From Git* option to create pipelines using operator-installed pipeline templates and resources while creating an application on {OCP}.

After you create the pipelines for your application, you can view and visually interact with the deployed pipelines in the *Pipelines* view. You can also use the *Topology* view to interact with the pipelines created using the *From Git* option. You must apply custom labels to pipelines created using the *Pipeline builder* to see them in the *Topology* view.
