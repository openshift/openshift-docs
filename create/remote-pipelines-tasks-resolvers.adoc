= Specifying remote pipelines and tasks using resolvers
:context: remote-pipelines-tasks-resolvers

toc::[]

Pipelines and tasks are reusable blocks for your CI/CD processes. You can reuse pipelines or tasks that you previously developed, or that were developed by others, without having to copy and paste their definitions. These pipelines or tasks can be available from several types of sources, from other namespaces on your cluster to public catalogs.

In a pipeline run resource, you can specify a pipeline from an existing source. In a pipeline resource or a task run resource, you can specify a task from an existing source.

In these cases, the _resolvers_ in {pipelines-title} retrieve the pipeline or task definition from the specified source at run time.

The following resolvers are available in a default installaton of {pipelines-title}:

Hub resolver:: Retrieves a task or pipeline from the Pipelines Catalog available on {artifact-hub} or {tekton-hub}.
Bundles resolver:: Retrieves a task or pipeline from a Tekton bundle, which is an OCI image available from any OCI repository, such as an OpenShift container repository.
Cluster resolver:: Retrieves a task or pipeline that is already created on the same {OCP} cluster in a specific namespace.
Git resolver:: Retrieves a task or pipeline binding from a Git repository. You must specify the repository, the branch, and the path.
HTTP resolver:: Retrieves a task or pipeline from a remote HTTP or HTTPS URL. You must specify the URL for authentication.

An {pipelines-shortname} installation includes a set of standard tasks that you can use in your pipelines. These tasks are located in the {pipelines-shortname} installation namespace, which is normally the `openshift-pipelines` namespace. You can use the cluster resolver to access the tasks.

[id="resolver-hub_{context}"]
== Specifying a remote pipeline or task from a Tekton catalog

You can use the hub resolver to specify a remote pipeline or task that is defined either in a public Tekton catalog of link:https://artifacthub.io/[{artifact-hub}] or in an instance of {tekton-hub}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {artifact-hub} project is not supported with {pipelines-title}. Only the configuration of {artifact-hub} is supported.

[id="resolver-bundles_{context}"]
== Specifying a remote pipeline or task from a Tekton bundle

You can use the bundles resolver to specify a remote pipeline or task from a Tekton bundle. A Tekton bundle is an OCI image available from any OCI repository, such as an OpenShift container repository.

[id="resolver-cluster_{context}"]
== Specifying a pipeline or task from the same cluster

You can use the cluster resolver to specify a pipeline or task that is defined in a namespace on the {OCP} cluster where {pipelines-title} is running.

In particular, you can use the cluster resolver to access tasks that {pipelines-shortname} provides in its installation namespace, which is normally the `openshift-pipelines` namespace.

[id="resolver-git-anon_{context}"]
== Specifying a remote pipeline or task with anonymous Git cloning

You can use the Git resolver to access a remote pipeline or task from a Git repository. The repository must include a YAML file that defines the pipeline or task. For anonymous access, you can clone repositories with the resolver without needing authentication credentials.

[id="resolver-git-scm_{context}"]
== Specifying a remote pipeline or task with an authenticated API

You can specify a remote pipeline or task from a Git repository by using the Git resolver. The repository must contain a YAML file that defines the pipeline or task. You can securely access repositories by using an authenticated API, which supports user authentication.

[id="resolver-http_{context}"]
== Specifying a remote pipeline or task by using the HTTP resolver

You can specify a remote pipeline or task from an HTTP or HTTPS URL by using the HTTP resolver. The URL must point to a YAML file that defines the pipeline or task.
