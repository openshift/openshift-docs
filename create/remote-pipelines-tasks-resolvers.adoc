= Specifying remote pipelines, tasks, and step actions using resolvers
:context: remote-pipelines-tasks-resolvers

toc::[]

Pipelines and tasks are reusable blocks for your CI/CD processes. You can reuse pipelines or tasks that you previously developed, or that were developed by others, without having to copy and paste their definitions. These pipelines or tasks can be available from several types of sources, from other namespaces on your cluster to public catalogs.

In a pipeline run resource, you can specify a pipeline from an existing source. In a pipeline resource or a task run resource, you can specify a task from an existing source.

Step actions, defined in `StepAction` custom resources (CRs), are reusable actions that a single step within a task completes. When specifying a step, you can reference a `StepAction` definition from an existing source.

In these cases, the _resolvers_ in {pipelines-title} retrieve the pipeline, task, or `StepAction` definition from the specified source at run time.

The following resolvers are available in a default installaton of {pipelines-title}:

Hub resolver:: Retrieves a task, pipeline, or `StepAction` definition from the Pipelines Catalog available on {artifact-hub} or {tekton-hub}.
Bundles resolver:: Retrieves a task, pipeline, or `StepAction` definition from a Tekton bundle, which is an OCI image available from any OCI repository, such as an OpenShift container repository.
Git resolver:: Retrieves a task, pipeline, or `StepAction` definition from a Git repository. You must specify the repository, the branch, and the path.
HTTP resolver:: Retrieves a task, pipeline, or `StepAction` definition from a remote HTTP or HTTPS URL. You must specify the URL for authentication.
Cluster resolver:: Retrieves a task, pipeline, or `StepAction` definition that is already created on the same {OCP} cluster in a specific namespace.

An {pipelines-shortname} installation includes a set of standard tasks that you can use in your pipelines. These tasks are located in the {pipelines-shortname} installation namespace, which is normally the `openshift-pipelines` namespace. You can use the cluster resolver to access the tasks.

{pipelines-shortname} also provides a standard `StepAction` definition. You can use the cluster resolver to access this definition.

[id="resolver-hub_{context}"]
== Specifying a remote pipeline, task, or step action from a Tekton catalog
You can use the hub resolver to specify a remote pipeline, task, or `StepAction` definition that is defined either in a public Tekton catalog of link:https://artifacthub.io/[{artifact-hub}] or in an instance of {tekton-hub}.

[NOTE]
====
The public instance of Tekton Hub (`hub.tekton.dev`) is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use link:https://artifacthub.io[Artifact Hub] as an alternative for Tekton `Pipeline` and `Task` resources:

* link:https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?repo=tekton-catalog-tasks[Tekton Catalog Tasks]  
* link:https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?repo=tekton-catalog-pipelines[Tekton Catalog Pipelines]

Artifact Hub is open source and supports self-hosting, providing greater flexibility for managing your Tekton `Pipeline` and `Task` resources.

[id="resolver-bundles_{context}"]
== Specifying a remote pipeline, task, or step action from a Tekton bundle

You can use the bundles resolver to specify a remote pipeline, task, or `StepAction` definition from a Tekton bundle. A Tekton bundle is an OCI image available from any OCI repository, such as an OpenShift container repository.

[id="resolver-git-anon_{context}"]
== Specifying a remote pipeline, task, or step action with anonymous Git cloning

You can use the Git resolver to access a remote pipeline, task, or `StepAction` definition from a Git repository. The repository must include a YAML file that defines the pipeline or task. For anonymous access, you can clone repositories with the resolver without needing authentication credentials.

[id="resolver-git-scm_{context}"]
== Specifying a remote pipeline, task, or step action with an authenticated Git API

You can specify a remote pipeline, task, or `StepAction` definition from a Git repository by using the Git resolver. The repository must contain a YAML file that defines the pipeline or task. You can securely access repositories by using an authenticated API, which supports user authentication.

[id="resolver-http_{context}"]
== Specifying a remote pipeline, task, or step action by using the HTTP resolver

You can specify a remote pipeline, task, or `StepAction` definition from an HTTP or HTTPS URL by using the HTTP resolver. The URL must point to a YAML file that defines the pipeline, task, or step action.

[id="resolver-cluster_{context}"]
== Specifying a pipeline, task, or step action from the same cluster

You can use the cluster resolver to specify a pipeline, task, or `StepAction` definition that is defined in a namespace on the {OCP} cluster where {pipelines-title} is running.

In particular, you can use the cluster resolver to access tasks that {pipelines-shortname} provides in its installation namespace, which is normally the `openshift-pipelines` namespace.
