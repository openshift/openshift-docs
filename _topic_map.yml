# Name: Origin of the Species          <= Display name of topic group
# Dir:  origin_of_the_species          <= Directory name of topic group
# Topics:
#   - Name: The Majestic Marmoset      <= Topic name
#     File: the_majestic_marmoset      <= Topic file under group dir +/- .adoc
#   - Name: The Curious Crocodile      <= Topic 2 name
#     File: the_curious_crocodile      <= Topic 2 file
#   - Name: The Numerous Nematodes     <= Sub-topic group name
#     Dir: the_numerous_nematodes      <= Sub-topic group dir
#     Topics:
#       - Name: The Wily Worm          <= Sub-topic name
#         File: the_wily_worm          <= Sub-topic file under <group dir>/<subtopic dir>
