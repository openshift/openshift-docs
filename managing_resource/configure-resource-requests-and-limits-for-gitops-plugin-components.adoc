You can configure CPU and memory resource requests and limits for the {gitops-shortname} console plugin and its backend cluster components. Resource allocation is controlled through the `GitOpsService` custom resource (CR) and can be modified during creation or update. The `GitOpsService` controller reconciles both the backend and plugin resources. You can define separate or identical resource configurations for each component, depending on your requirements. This feature is  beneficial for scenarios requiring specific resource requests and limits for components, which can effectively address memory and performance issues.
