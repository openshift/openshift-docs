A slow, unreliable connection to an image registry can interfere with operations that require pulling images, such as updating a cluster or deploying an application. This can include clusters that have low bandwidth, clusters with unreliable internet connectivity, or clusters in a disconnected environment. For example, a cluster update might require pulling more than one hundred images. Failure to pull those images could cause retries that can interfere with the update process and might cause the update to fail. 

One way to prevent this is to pull the required images in advance, before they are actually needed, and _pinning_ those images to a specific machine config pool (MCP). This ensures that the images are available to your nodes when needed. Pinned images can provide a more consistent update, which is important when scheduling updates into maintenance windows.

Pinned images also ensures that the images are available when deploying applications, so that you can deploy in a more reliable manner. 

You can pin images to specific nodes by using a `PinnedImageSet` custom resource (CR), as described in _Pinning images_. Pinned images are stored on the nodes in the `/etc/crio/crio.conf.d/50-pinned-images` file on those nodes. The contents of the file appear similar to the following example:

[source,terminal]
----
[crio]
  [crio.image]
    pinned_images = ["quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@sha256:4198606580b69c8335ad7ae531c3a74e51aee25db5faaf368234e8c8dae5cbea", "quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@sha256:513cf1028aa1a021fa73d0601427a0fbcf6d212b88aaf9d76d4e4841a061e44e", "quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@sha256:61eae2d261e54d1b8a0e05f6b5326228b00468364563745eed88460af04f909b"]

Another benefit to pinned images is that image garbage collection does not remove the pinned images.

Before pulling the images, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) verifies that there is enough storage space available on each affected node. If the node has sufficient space, the MCO creates the pinned image file, pulls the images, and reloads CRI-O. If there is not sufficient space, the MCO does not pull the images and presents an error message.
