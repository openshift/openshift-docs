This paragraph is the assembly introduction. It explains what the user will accomplish by working through the modules in the assembly and sets the context for the user story the assembly is based on. Can include more than one paragraph. Consider using the information from the user story.

[id='terminology-{context}']
== Terminology
include::modules/service-brokers-glossary.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

[id='terminology2-{context}']
== Terminology2
Testing Tags
include::modules/service-brokers-glossary.adoc[leveloffset=+1, tags=service-brokers-glossary-cluster-service-broker;service-brokers-glossary-cluster-service-class]

[id='prerequisites-{context}']
== Prerequisites

* A bulleted list of conditions that must be satisfied before the user starts following this assembly.
* You can also link to other modules or assemblies the user must follow before starting this assembly.
* Delete the section title and bullets if the assembly has no prerequisites.

// The following include statements pull in the module files that comprise
// the assembly. Include any combination of concept, procedure, or reference
// modules required to cover the user story. You can also include other
// assemblies.

Include modules here.

// [leveloffset=+1] ensures that when a module starts with a level-1 heading
// (= Heading), the heading will be interpreted as a level-2 heading
// (== Heading) in the assembly.

[id='related-information-{context}']
== Related information

* A bulleted list of links to other material closely related to the contents of the concept module.
