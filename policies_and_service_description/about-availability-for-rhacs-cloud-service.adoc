[role="_abstract"]
If the {rh-rhacscs-first} Central instance fails, it might impact the security of customer data and operations.
Central instance is responsible for managing and enforcing security policies, providing global scans, and performing updates for {product-title-managed-short} deployments across clusters.
If this service is unavailable, several critical security functions might be compromised.

[id="impact-on-policy-updates_{context}"]
== Impact on policy updates

Policy updates might be delayed or unavailable during downtime.
Central instance enables customers to define and enforce security policies for their clusters, including rules for container images, network communications and access controls.

These policies are critical to ensuring that only authorized and secure workloads are deployed and running in the clusters.
If Central is not available, policy updates might not be applied in a timely manner, leaving clusters potentially vulnerable to security risks.

[id="impact-on-global-scanning_{context}"]
== Impact on global scanning

Global scanning might be affected during downtime. Central provides global scanning capabilities to detect and prevent security vulnerabilities and threats across all clusters managed by the service.
This includes scanning container images, monitoring network traffic, and identifying potential security issues.
When Central instance is unavailable, global scanning might be interrupted or delayed, limiting the ability to detect and mitigate security risks across all clusters.

[id="impact-on-managing-certificates-and-private-keys_{context}"]
== Impact on managing certificates and private keys

Central instance is also responsible for managing certificates and private keys used to secure communications between components of the {product-title-managed-short}.
If the service fails, the certificate and key management functions might be compromised, which might affect the integrity and confidentiality of communications within the {product-title-managed-short} environment.

To mitigate the impact of Central instance failure on customer security, it is important to have a robust backup plan.
This can include redundant cluster-level security controls and processes, such as enforcing local policies and scanning mechanisms.

In addition, you must establish regular monitoring and alerting to quickly identify and address potential security issues during downtime.
It is also important to closely monitor updates and communications from the {product-title-managed-short} provider about the status and remediation of outage events and take appropriate action when necessary.
