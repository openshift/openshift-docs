[id="introduction-to-rhacs_{context}"]
== Introduction to RHACS

{rh-rhacs-first} is an enterprise-ready, Kubernetes-native container security solution that helps you build, deploy, and run cloud-native applications more securely.

{rh-rhacscs-first} provides Kubernetes-native security as a service.
With {product-title-managed-short}, Red Hat maintains, upgrades, and manages your Central services.

Central services include the user interface (UI), data storage, and {product-title-short} application programming interface (API).
You deploy your Central service through the link:https://console.redhat.com/[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.] When you create a new Central instance, Red Hat creates your individual control plane for {product-title-short}.

{product-title-managed-short} allows you to secure self-managed clusters that can reach out to Central service instance.
The clusters you secure, called Secured Clusters, are managed by you, and not by Red Hat.
Secured Cluster services include optional vulnerability scanning services, admission control services, and data collection services used for runtime monitoring and compliance.
You install Secured Cluster services on any OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster you want to secure.

[id="billing_{context}"]
== Billing

Customers can purchase a {product-title-managed-short} subscription on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) marketplace.
Service costs are charged hourly per core. Total core data points are collected at regular intervals, averaged hourly, and then matched against your subscription.

[id="sizing_{context}"]
== Sizing

Use the following guidelines to determine how many {rh-rhacs-first} subscriptions you need:

[%autowidth]
|===
|OpenShift or Kubernetes environment |Recommended {product-title-managed-short} subscription

|Red Hat OpenShift environments priced  based on the number of cores.

a| * One {product-title-managed-short} subscription for every 1 core or 2 vCPUs in your OpenShift environment.
* You can also protect the Kubernetes Control plane and infrastructure nodes in your environment.

|{osp} environments priced based on the number of sockets.
a| * One {product-title-managed-short} subscription for every OpenShift subscription for a bare-metal node with 1-2 sockets.
* You can also protect the Control plane and infrastructure nodes in your environment.

|For supported third-party Kubernetes environments.
a| * The number of {product-title-managed-short} subscriptions you need is equal to the number of managed cores, up to 1 core or 2 vCPUs each.
* Typically, you cannot protect infrastructure and Control plane nodes due to access controls.

[id="security-and-compliance_{context}"]
== Security and Compliance

All {rh-rhacscs-first} data in the Central instance is encrypted in transit and at rest.
The data is stored in secure storage with full replication and high availability together with regularly scheduled backups.
The {product-title-managed-short} is available through cloud data centers that ensure optimal performance and the ability to meet data residency requirements.

[id="authentication-provider_{context}"]
=== Authentication provider

When you create a Central instance using  link:https://console.redhat.com/[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console], authentication for the cluster administrator is configured as part of the process.
Customers must manage all access to the Central instance as part of their integrated solution.
Read more about the available authentication methods in xref:../operating/manage-user-access/understanding-authentication-providers.adoc[Understanding authentication providers].

The default identity provider in {rh-rhacs-first} is Red Hat Single Sign-On (SSO). Read more about authentication using Red Hat SSO in xref:../installing/getting-started-rhacs-cloud-ocp.adoc#default-access-acs-console[Default access to ACS Console].

[id="scalability-and-service-level_{context}"]
== Scalability and Service Level

{rh-rhacscs-first} has set limits on the number of cores or clusters it can protect.
The limits are based on the resources available in the Secured Cluster and the limits on usability.

[id="service-level-objective-and-agreement_{context}"]
=== Service Level Objective and Agreement

Read more about Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in link:https://www.redhat.com/licenses/Appendix_4_Red_Hat_Online_Services_20221213.pdf[PRODUCT APPENDIX 4 RED HAT ONLINE SERVICES].


[id="updates-and-upgrades_{context}"]
== Updates and Upgrades

Red Hat makes a commercially reasonable effort to notify customers prior to updates and upgrades that impact service.
The decision regarding the need for a Service update to the Central instance and its timing is the sole responsibility of Red Hat.

Customers have no control over when a Central service update occurs. For more information, see link:https://www.redhat.com/licenses/Appendix_4_Red_Hat_Online_Services_20221213.pdf[PRODUCT APPENDIX 4 RED HAT ONLINE SERVICES].
Upgrades to the version of {rh-rhacscs-first} are considered part of the service update.

The version of {product-title-managed-short} used on Secured Clusters must match the version of the Central instance of {product-title-managed-short} to ensure compatibility.
Customers are responsible for Secured Cluster services upgrades required to maintain this version compatibility.

[id="availability_{context}"]
== Availability

Availability and disaster avoidance are extremely important aspects of any security platform. {rh-rhacscs-first} provides numerous protections against failures at multiple levels.
To account for possible cloud provider failures, Red Hat established a  multiple availability zones.


[id="backup-and-disaster-recovery_{context}"]
=== Backup and Disaster Recovery

All {product-title-managed-short} clusters are backed up using Database backups.
This also applies to customer data stored in the Central database.

All snapshots are created using the appropriate cloud provider snapshot APIs, encrypted  and then uploaded to secure object storage, which for  Amazon Web Services (AWS) is an S3 bucket.

* Red Hat does not commit to a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) or Recovery Time Objective (RTO). For more information, see link:https://www.redhat.com/licenses/Appendix_4_Red_Hat_Online_Services_20221213.pdf[PRODUCT APPENDIX 4 RED HAT ONLINE SERVICES].

* Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) performs backups only as a precautionary measure. They are stored in the same region as the cluster.

* Customers should deploy multiple Availability Zone Secured Clusters with workloads that follow Kubernetes best practices to ensure high availability within a region.
