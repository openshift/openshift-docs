[[apb-devel-writing-ref-overview]]
== Overview

While the xref:getting_started.adoc#apb-devel-writing-getting-started[Getting Started] topic provides a step by step walkthrough on creating your first
Ansible Playbook Bundle (APB), this topic provides more in-depth reference
material. The fundamental components that make up an APB are explained in
further detail to help an experienced APB developer get a better understanding
of each individual component within an APB. 

For completed APB examples, you can browse APBs in the
link:https://github.com/ansibleplaybookbundle[*ansibleplaybookbundle*]
organization on GitHub.

[[apb-devel-writing-ref-spec]]
== APB Spec File

The APB spec file is located at *_apb.yml_* and is where the outline of your
application is declared. The following is an example APB spec:

|===

When using a long list of parameters, it can be useful to use a shared parameter
list. For an example of this, see the
link:https://github.com/ansibleplaybookbundle/rhscl-postgresql-apb/blob/master/apb.yml#L4[*rhscl-postgresql-apb*].

[[apb-devel-writing-ref-spec-versioning]]
=== APB Spec Versioning

The APB spec uses semantic versioning with the format of `x.y` where `x` is a
major release and `y` is a minor release.

The current spec version is `1.0`.

[[apb-devel-writing-ref-spec-versioning-major]]
==== Major Version

The APB spec will increment the major version whenever an API breaking change is introduced to the spec. Some examples include:

- Introduction or deletion of a required field.
- Changing the YAML format.
- New features.

[[apb-devel-writing-ref-spec-versioning-minor]]
==== Minor Version

The APB spec will increment the minor version whenever a non-breaking change is introduced to the spec. Some examples include:

- Introduction or deletion of an optional field.
- Spelling change.
- Introduction of new options to an existing field.

[[apb-devel-writing-ref-dockerfile]]
== Dockerfile

The *_Dockerfile_* is what is used to actually build the APB image. As a result,
sometimes you will need to customize it for your own needs. For example, if
running a playbook that requires interactions with PostgreSQL, you may want to
install the required packages by adding the `yum install` command:

----
FROM ansibleplaybookbundle/apb-base
MAINTAINER Ansible Playbook Bundle Community

LABEL "com.redhat.apb.spec"=\
"<------------base64-encoded-spec------------>"


COPY roles /opt/ansible/roles
COPY playbooks /opt/apb/actions
RUN chmod -R g=u /opt/{ansible,apb}


### INSTALL THE REQUIRED PACKAGES
RUN yum -y install python-boto postgresql && yum clean all

USER apb
----

[[apb-devel-writing-ref-actions]]
== APB Actions (Playbooks)

An action for an APB is the command that the APB is run with. The standard
actions that are supported are:

- provision
- deprovision
- bind
- unbind
- test

For an action to be valid, there must be a valid file in the *_playbooks/_*
directory named *_<action>.yml_*. These playbooks can do anything, which also
means that you can technically create any action you would like. For example,
the
link:https://github.com/ansibleplaybookbundle/mediawiki123-apb/blob/master/playbooks/update.yml[mediawiki-apb]
has playbook creating an `update` action.

Most APBs will normally have a provision action to create resources and a
deprovision action to destroy the resources when deleting the service.

The bind and unbind actions are used when the coordinates of one service needs
to be made available to another service. This is often the case when creating a
data service and making it available to an application. Currently, the
coordinates are made available during the provision.

To properly make your coordinates available to another service, use the
*asb_encode_binding* module. This module should be called at the end of the
APB's provision role, and it will return bind credentials to the OpenShift
Ansible broker (OAB):

[source,yaml]
----
- name: encode bind credentials
  asb_encode_binding:
    fields:
      EXAMPLE_FIELD: foo
      EXAMPLE_FIELD2: foo2
----

[[apb-devel-writing-ref-resources]]
== Working With Common Resources

This section describes a list of common {product-title} resources that are
created when developing APBs. See the
link:https://github.com/ansible/ansible-kubernetes-modules/tree/master/library[Ansible Kubernetes Module] for a full list of available resource modules.

[[apb-devel-writing-ref-resources-svc]]
=== Service

The following is a sample Ansible task to create a service named *hello-world*.
The `namespace` variable in an APB will be provided by the OAB when launched
from the web console.

.Provision
[source,yaml]
----
- name: create hello-world service
  k8s_v1_service:
    name: hello-world
    namespace: '{{ namespace }}'
    labels:
      app: hello-world
      service: hello-world
    selector:
      app: hello-world
      service: hello-world
    ports:
      - name: web
        port: 8080
        target_port: 8080

[[apb-devel-writing-ref-resources-dc]]
=== Deployment Configuration

The following is a sample Ansible task to create a deployment configuration for
the image *docker.io/ansibleplaybookbundle/hello-world* which maps to service
*hello-world*.

.Provision
[source,yaml]
----
- name: create deployment config
  openshift_v1_deployment_config:
    name: hello-world
    namespace: '{{ namespace }}'
    labels:
      app: hello-world
      service: hello-world
    replicas: 1
    selector:
      app: hello-world
      service: hello-world
    spec_template_metadata_labels:
      app: hello-world
      service: hello-world
    containers:
    - env:
      image: docker.io/ansibleplaybookbundle/hello-world:latest
      name: hello-world
      ports:
      - container_port: 8080
        protocol: TCP
----

----

[[apb-devel-writing-ref-resources-route]]
=== Route

The following is an example of creating a route named *hello-world* which maps
to the service *hello-world*.

.Provision
[source,yaml]
----
- name: create hello-world route
  openshift_v1_route:
    name: hello-world
    namespace: '{{ namespace }}'
    spec_port_target_port: web
    labels:
      app: hello-world
      service: hello-world
    to_name: hello-world
----

.Deprovision
[source,yaml]
----
- openshift_v1_route:
    name: hello-world
    namespace: '{{ namespace }}'
    state: absent
----

[[apb-devel-writing-ref-resources-pv]]
=== Persistent Volume

The following is an example of creating a persistent volume claim (PVC) resource
and deployment configuration that uses it.

.Provision
[source,yaml]
----
# Persistent volume resource
- name: create volume claim
  k8s_v1_persistent_volume_claim:
    name: hello-world-db
    namespace: '{{ namespace }}'
    state: present
    access_modes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources_requests:
      storage: 1Gi
----

In addition to the resource, add your volume to the deployment configuration
declaration:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: create hello-world-db deployment config
  openshift_v1_deployment_config:
    name: hello-world-db
    ---
    volumes:
    - name: hello-world-db
      persistent_volume_claim:
        claim_name: hello-world-db
      test: false
      triggers:
      - type: ConfigChange
----

.Deprovision
[source,yaml]
----
- openshift_v1_deployment_config:
    name: hello-world-db
    namespace: '{{ namespace }}'
    state: absent

- k8s_v1_persistent_volume_claim:
    name: hello-world-db
    namespace: '{{ namespace }}'
    state: absent
----

[[apb-devel-writing-ref-optional-vars]]
== Optional Variables

You can add optional variables to an APB by using environment variables. To pass
variables into an APB, you must escape the variable substitution in your
*_.yml_* files.

For example, consider the following
*_roles/provision-etherpad-apb/tasks/main.yml_* file in the
link:https://github.com/ansibleplaybookbundle/etherpad-apb[*etherpad-apb*]:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: create mariadb deployment config
  openshift_v1_deployment_config:
    name: mariadb
    namespace: '{{ namespace }}'
    ...
    - env:
      - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
        value: '{{ mariadb_root_password }}'
      - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
        value: '{{ mariadb_name }}'
      - name: MYSQL_USER
        value: '{{ mariadb_user }}'
      - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
        value: '{{ mariadb_password }}'
----

Variables for the APB are defined in the
*_roles/provision-etherpad-apb/defaults/main.yml_* file:

[source,yaml]
----
playbook_debug: no
mariadb_root_password: "{{ lookup('env','MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD') | default('admin', true) }}"
mariadb_name: "{{ lookup('env','MYSQL_DATABASE') | default('etherpad', true) }}"
mariadb_user: "{{ lookup('env','MYSQL_USER') | default('etherpad', true) }}"
mariadb_password: "{{ lookup('env','MYSQL_PASSWORD') | default('admin', true) }}"
etherpad_admin_password: "{{ lookup('env','ETHERPAD_ADMIN_PASSWORD') | default('admin', true) }}"
etherpad_admin_user: "{{ lookup('env','ETHERPAD_ADMIN_USER') | default('etherpad', true) }}"
etherpad_db_host: "{{ lookup('env','ETHERPAD_DB_HOST') | default('mariadb', true) }}"
state: present
----

[[apb-devel-writing-ref-remote-clusters]]
== Working with Remote Clusters

When developing APBs, there are a few factors which could prevent the developer
from using the full development lifecycle that the `apb` tooling offers.
Primarily, these factors are:

- Developing against an {product-title} cluster that exists on a remote host.
- Developing APBs on a machine that does not have access to the *docker* daemon.

If a developer meets any of these criteria, use the following workflow to
publish images to the internal {product-title} registry so that the broker can
bootstrap the image (the process of loading APB specs into the broker). The
following sections show how to do these steps with the `apb` tooling and
without.

[[apb-devel-writing-ref-remote-clusters-pushing-apbs]]
=== Pushing APBs

To use the `apb push` command when working with a remote {product-title}
cluster:

. Ensure the base64-encoded APB spec is a label in the Dockerfile. This is usually
done using the `apb prepare` command. If you do not have the `apb` tooling
installed, you can run:
+
----
$ cat apb.yml | base64
----
+
This will return the base64-encoded *_apb.yml_*, which you can copy and paste
into the *_Dockerfile_* under the `LABEL "com.redhat.apb.spec"` like:
+
----
LABEL "com.redhat.apb.spec"=\

. Populate the internal {product-title} registry with your built APB image.
+
This is normally handled by the `apb push` command. In order to build your image
without using the `docker` CLI, you can take advantage of the S2I functionality
of {product-title}.
+
By default, the OAB is configured to look for published APBs in the
*openshift* project, which is a global namespace that
exposes its images and image streams to be available to any authenticated user
on the cluster. You can take advantage of this by using the `oc new-app` command
in the *openshift* project to build your image:
+
----
$ oc new-app <path_to_bundle_source> \
    --name <bundle_name> \
    -n openshift
----
+
After a couple of minutes, you should see your image in the internal registry:
+
----
$ oc get images | grep <bundle_name>

sha256:b2dcb4b95e178e9b7ac73e5ee0211080c10b24260f76cfec30b89e74e8ee6742   172.30.1.1:5000/openshift/<bundle_name>@sha256:b2dcb4b95e178e9b7ac73e5ee0211080c10b24260f76cfec30b89e74e8ee6742
----

. Bootstrap the OAB. This is normally also handled by the `apb push` or `apb
bootstrap` command. The `apb bootstrap` command is preferable for this step
because it will also relist the service catalog without having to wait five to
ten minutes.
+
If you do not have the `apb` tooling installed, you can run:
+
----
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
$ oc get route -n openshift-ansible-service-broker
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
$ oc get route -n ansible-service-broker
endif::[]

NAME       HOST/PORT                                           PATH      SERVICES   PORT        TERMINATION   WILDCARD
asb-1338   asb-1338-ansible-service-broker.172.17.0.1.nip.io             asb        port-1338   reencrypt     None

$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(oc whoami -t)" -k -X POST https://asb-1338-ansible-service-broker.172.17.0.1.nip.io/ansible-service-broker/v2/bootstrap                                 
{
  "spec_count": 38,
  "image_count": 109
}
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `oc whoami -t` command should return a token and the authenticated user must
have permissions as described in
xref:../../apb_devel/cli_tooling.adoc#apb-devel-cli-install-prereqs-access-permissions[Access Permissions].
====

. Verify the new APB exists in the OAB. This is normally the functionality of the
`apb list` command. If you do not have the `apb` tooling installed, you can use
the route gathered from the previous step and run:
+
----
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(oc whoami -t)" -k https://asb-1338-ansible-service-broker.172.17.0.1.nip.io/ansible-service-broker/v2/catalog
----
+
You should see a list of all bootstrapped APB specs and one that is labeled
`localregistry-<bundle_name>`. Use `|grep <bundle_name>` to help find it, since
the output is in JSON.

[[apb-devel-writing-ref-remote-clusters-running-apbs]]
=== Running APBs

Due to the limitations when working with remote clusters, you may want the same
functionality as the `apb run` command without having to rely on the `apb push`
command being successful. This is because `apb run` implicitly performs `apb
push` first before attempting to provision the application. 

In order to work around this:

. Follow the steps described in
xref:apb-devel-writing-ref-remote-clusters-pushing-apbs[Pushing APBs] to push
your image onto the internal {product-title} registry. After the image exists,
you should be able to see it with:

== Working With the Restricted SCC

When building an {product-title} image, it is important that you do not have your application running as the root user when at all possible. When running under the *restriced* security context, the application image is launched with a random UID. This causes problems if your application folder is owned by the root user.

A good way to work around this is to add a user to the root group and make the
application folder owned by the root group. See
xref:../../creating_images/guidelines.adoc#openshift-specific-guidelines[{product-title}-Specific Guidelines] for details on supporting arbitrary user IDs.

The following is a *_Dockerfile_* example of a node application running in
*_/usr/src_*. This command would be run after the application is installed in
*_/usr/src_* and the associated environment variables set:

----
ENV USER_NAME=haste \
    USER_UID=1001 \
    HOME=/usr/src

RUN useradd -u ${USER_UID} -r -g 0 -M -d /usr/src -b /usr/src -s /sbin/nologin -c "<username> user" ${USER_NAME} \
               && chown -R ${USER_NAME}:0 /usr/src \
               && chmod -R g=u /usr/src /etc/passwd
USER 1001

[[apb-devel-writing-ref-configmap]]
== Using a ConfigMap Within an APB

There is a temporary workaround for creating ConfigMaps from Ansible due to a
bug in the Ansible modules.

One common use case for ConfigMaps is when the parameters of an APB will be used
within a configuration file of an application or service. The ConfigMap module
allows you to mount a ConfigMap into a pod as a volume, which can be used to
store the configuration file. This approach allows you to also leverage the
power of Ansible's *template* module to create a ConfigMap out of APB paramters.

The following is an example of creating a ConfigMap from a Jinja template
mounted into a pod as a volume:

[source,yaml]
----
- name: Create hastebin config from template
  template:
    src: config.js.j2
    dest: /tmp/config.js

- name: Create hastebin configmap
  shell: oc create configmap haste-config --from-file=haste-config=/tmp/config.js

<snip>

- name: create deployment config
  openshift_v1_deployment_config:
    name: hastebin
    namespace: '{{ namespace }}'
    labels:
      app: hastebin
      service: hastebin
    replicas: 1
    selector:
      app: hastebin
      service: hastebin
    spec_template_metadata_labels:
      app: hastebin
      service: hastebin
    containers:
    - env:
      image: docker.io/dymurray/hastebin:latest
      name: hastebin
      ports:
      - container_port: 7777
        protocol: TCP
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /usr/src/haste-server/config
          name: config
    - env:
      image: docker.io/modularitycontainers/memcached:latest
      name: memcached
      ports:
      - container_port: 11211
        protocol: TCP
    volumes:
      - name: config
        configMap:
          name: haste-config
          items:
            - key: haste-config
              path: config.js

[[apb-devel-writing-ref-custom-error-msg]]
== Customizing Error Messages

A default error message is returned in the web console when a provision call
fails. For example:

----
Error occurred during provision. Please contact administrator if the issue persists.
----

To provide more information for troubleshooting purposes should a failure occur,
you can write custom error messages for your APB that the web console can check
for and return to the user.

Kubernetes allows pods to log fatal events to a termination log. The log file
location is set by the `terminationMessagePath` field in a pod's specification
and defaults to *_/dev/termination-log_*.

Starting in {product-title} 3.10, the broker now checks this termination log for
any messages that have been written to the file and passes the content to the
service catalog. The web console then displays any such messages found in the
event of a failure.

[NOTE]
====
See
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/determine-reason-pod-failure/[Kubernetes documentation] for more details on pod termination messages.
====

The following is an example of how this can be done in an APB utilizing a
CloudFormation template:

----
- name: Writing Termination Message
  shell: echo "[CloudFormation Error] - {{ ansible_failed_result.msg }}" > /dev/termination-log

- fail: msg="[APB Failed Plain - '{{ _apb_plan_id }}'] "
----

If an error occurs, this example custom message is written to the default
termination log path before it fails the pod.
