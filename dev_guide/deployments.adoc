== Overview

{product-title} deployments provide fine-grained management over applications
based on a user defined template called a deployment configuration.
The deployment system in response to a deployment configuration will
create a replication controller to run an application. Replication
controllers are created manually or in response to triggered events.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Users should never manipulate replication controllers owned by
deployment configurations. The deployment system makes sure changes to
deployment configurations are propagated appropriately to replication
controllers.
====

Features provided by the deployment system:

- A xref:creating-a-deployment-configuration[deployment configuration], which is a template for running applications.
- xref:triggers[Triggers] that drive automated deployments in response to events.
- User-customizable xref:strategies[strategies] to transition from the previous version to the new version.
- xref:rolling-back-a-deployment[Rollbacks] to a previous version either manually or automatically in case of deployment failure.
- Manual replication xref:scaling[scaling] and autoscaling.

The deployment configuration contains a version number that is incremented
each time a new replication controller is created from that configuration.
In addition, the cause of the last deployed replication controller is added
to the configuration.

[[creating-a-deployment-configuration]]
== Creating a Deployment Configuration

A deployment configuration consists of the following key parts:

- A pod template which describes the application to be deployed.
- The default replica count for the replication controller.
- A deployment xref:strategies[strategy] which will be used to deploy the application.
- A set of xref:triggers[triggers] which cause replication controllers to be created automatically.

Deployment configurations are `*deploymentConfig*` {product-title} API resources
which can be managed with the `oc` command like any other resource. The
following is an example of a `*deploymentConfig*` resource:

====

[source,yaml]
----
kind: "DeploymentConfig"
apiVersion: "v1"
metadata: 
  name: "frontend"
spec: 
  template: <1>
    metadata: 
      labels: 
        name: "frontend"
    spec: 
      containers: 
        - name: "helloworld"
          image: "openshift/origin-ruby-sample"
          ports: 
            - containerPort: 8080
              protocol: "TCP"
  replicas: 5 <2>
  triggers: 
    - type: "ConfigChange" <3>
    - type: "ImageChange" <4>
      imageChangeParams: 
        automatic: true
        containerNames: 
          - "helloworld"
        from: 
          kind: "ImageStreamTag"
          name: "origin-ruby-sample:latest"
  strategy: <5>
    type: "Rolling"
  paused: false <6>
  revisionHistoryLimit: 2 <7>
  minReadySeconds: 0 <8>

----

<1> The pod template of the `frontend` deployment configuration describes a simple Ruby application.
<2> There will be 5 replicas of `frontend`.
<3> A xref:config-change-trigger[configuration change trigger] causes a new replication controller to be created any time the pod template changes.
<4> An xref:image-change-trigger[image change trigger] trigger causes a new replication controller to be
created each time a new version of the `origin-ruby-sample:latest` image stream tag is available.
<5> The xref:rolling-strategy[Rolling strategy] is the default way of deploying your pods. May be omitted.
<6> If true, `paused` makes inert your deployment configuration and subsequent changes to the pod template or new images will not run new deployments.
<7> Revision history limit is the limit of old replication controllers you want to keep around for rolling back. May be omitted.
<8> Minimum seconds to wait (after the readiness checks succeed) for a pod to be considered available. May be omitted.
====

[[start-deployment]]
== Starting a Deployment

You can start a new deployment manually using the web console, or from the CLI:

----
$ oc deploy --latest dc/<name>
----

NOTE: If there's already a deployment in progress, the command will display a
message and a new replication controller will not be deployed.

[[viewing-a-deployment]]

== Viewing a Deployment

To get basic information about recent deployments:

----
$ oc rollout history dc/<name>
----

This will show details about all recently deployed replication controllers for
the provided deployment configuration, including any currently running deployment.
You can view details specific to a revision by using the `--revision` flag:

----
$ oc rollout history dc/<name> --revision=1
----

For more detailed information about a deployment configuration and its latest deployment:

----
$ oc describe dc <name>
----

[NOTE]
====
The xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.html#project-overviews[web console]
shows deployments in the *Browse* tab.
====

[[canceling-a-deployment]]

== Canceling a Deployment

To cancel a running or stuck deployment:

----
$ oc deploy --cancel dc/<name>
----

WARNING: The cancellation is a best-effort operation, and may take some time to
complete. It's possible the replication controller will partially or totally complete
being deployed before the cancellation is effective.

[[retrying-a-deployment]]

== Retrying a Deployment

To retry the last failed deployment:

----
$ oc deploy --retry dc/<name>
----

If the last deployment didn't fail, the command will display a message and the
deployment will not be retried.

NOTE: Retrying a deployment restarts the deployment and does not create a new
deployment revision. The restarted deployment will have the same configuration
it had when it failed.

[[rolling-back-a-deployment]]
== Rolling Back a Deployment

Rollbacks revert an application back to a previous template and can be
performed using the REST API, the CLI, or the web console.

To rollback to the last successful deployed revision of your configuration:

----
$ oc rollout undo dc/<name>
----

The deployment configuration's template will be reverted to match the deployment
revision specified in the undo command, and a new replication controller will be started.
If no revision is specified with --to-revision, then the last successfully deployed
revision will be used.

Image change triggers on the deployment configuration are disabled as part of
the rollback to prevent unwanted deployments soon after the rollback is
complete. To re-enable the image change triggers:

----
$ oc deploy --enable-triggers dc/<name>
----

NOTE: Deployment configurations also support automatically rolling back to the
last successful revision of the configuration in case the latest template fails
to deploy. In that case, the latest template that failed to deploy stays intact
by the system and it's up to users to fix their configurations.


[[viewing-deployment-logs]]

== Viewing Deployment Logs

To stream the logs of the latest revision for a given deployment configuration:

----
$ oc logs -f dc/<name>
----

If the latest revision is running or failed, `oc logs` will return the logs of the
process that is responsible for deploying your pods. If it is successful, `oc logs`
will return the logs from a pod of your application.

You can also view logs from older failed deployments, if and only if the old deployment
exists and hasn't been pruned or deleted manually:

----
$ oc logs --version=1 dc/<name>
----

For more options on retrieving logs see:

----
$ oc logs -h
----


[[triggers]]
== Triggers

A deployment configuration can contain triggers, which drive the creation of new
replication controllers in response to events, only inside {product-title} at the moment.

WARNING: If no triggers are defined on a deployment configuration, a ConfigChange
trigger is added by default. If triggers are defined as an empty field, deployments
must be xref:start-deployment[started manually].

[[config-change-trigger]]
=== Configuration Change Trigger

The ConfigChange trigger results in a new replication controller whenever changes are
detected in the pod template of the deployment configuration.

NOTE: If a ConfigChange trigger is defined on a deployment configuration,
the first replication controller will be automatically created soon after
the deployment configuration itself is created.

The following is an example of a ConfigChange trigger:

====

[source,yaml]
----
triggers: 
  - type: "ConfigChange"
----
====

[[image-change-trigger]]
=== Image Change Trigger

The ImageChange trigger results in a new replication controller whenever the value of an
image stream tag changes.

The following is an example of an ImageChange trigger:

====

[source,json]
----
triggers: 
  - type: "ImageChange"
    imageChangeParams: 
      automatic: true <1>
      from: 
        kind: "ImageStreamTag"
        name: "origin-ruby-sample:latest"
      containerNames: 
        - "helloworld"
----
<1> If the `*automatic*` option is set to `false`, the trigger is disabled.
====

With the above example, when the `latest` tag value of the `origin-ruby-sample`
image stream changes and the new tag value differs from the current image
specified in the deployment configuration's `helloworld` container, a new
deployment is created using the new tag value for the `helloworld` container.

[[strategies]]
== Strategies

A deployment strategy determines the deployment process, and is defined by the
deployment configuration. Each application has different requirements for
availability (and other considerations) during deployments. {product-title} provides
strategies to support a variety of deployment scenarios.

A deployment strategy uses xref:../dev_guide/application_health.html[readiness
checks] to determine if a new pod is ready for use. If a readiness check
fails, the deployment config will retry to run the pod until it times out.

The xref:rolling-strategy[Rolling strategy] is the default strategy used if
no strategy is specified on a deployment configuration.

[[rolling-strategy]]
=== Rolling Strategy

The rolling strategy performs a rolling update and supports
xref:lifecycle-hooks[lifecycle hooks] for injecting code into the deployment
process.

The rolling deployment strategy waits for pods to pass their
xref:../dev_guide/application_health.html[readiness check] before scaling down
old components, and does not allow pods that do not pass their readiness check
within a configurable timeout.

The following is an example of the Rolling strategy:

====
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: Rolling
  rollingParams:
    timeoutSeconds: 120 <1>
    maxSurge: "20%" <2>
    maxUnavailable: "10%" <3>
    pre: {} <4>
    post: {}
----
<1> How long to wait for a scaling event before giving up. Optional; the default is 120.
<2> `*maxSurge*` is optional and defaults to `25%`; see below.
<3> `*maxUnavailable*` is optional and defaults to `25%`; see below.
<4> `*pre*` and `*post*` are both xref:lifecycle-hooks[lifecycle hooks].
====

The Rolling strategy will:

. Execute any `*pre*` lifecycle hook.
. Scale up the new replication controller based on the surge count.
. Scale down the old replication controller based on the max unavailable count.
. Repeat this scaling until the new replication controller has reached the desired
replica count and the old replication controller has been scaled to zero.
. Execute any `*post*` lifecycle hook.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When scaling down, the Rolling strategy waits for pods to become ready so it can
decide whether further scaling would affect availability. If scaled up pods
never become ready, the deployment will eventually time out and result in a
deployment failure.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
When executing the `*post*` lifecycle hook, all failures will be ignored
regardless of the failure policy specified on the hook.
====

The `*maxUnavailable*` parameter is the maximum number of pods that can be
unavailable during the update. The `*maxSurge*` parameter is the maximum number
of pods that can be scheduled above the original number of pods. Both parameters
can be set to either a percentage (e.g.,  *10%*) or an absolute value (e.g.,
*2*). The default value for both is *25%*.

These parameters allow the deployment to be tuned for availability and speed. For
example:

- `*maxUnavailable*=0` and `*maxSurge*=20%` ensures full capacity is maintained
during the update and rapid scale up.
- `*maxUnavailable*=10%` and `*maxSurge*=0` performs an update using no extra
capacity (an in-place update).
- `*maxUnavailable*=10%` and `*maxSurge*=10%` scales up and down quickly with
some potential for capacity loss.

[[recreate-strategy]]
=== Recreate Strategy

The Recreate strategy has basic rollout behavior and supports
xref:lifecycle-hooks[lifecycle hooks] for injecting code into the deployment
process.

The following is an example of the Recreate strategy:

====

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: Recreate
  recreateParams: <1>
    pre: {} <2>
    post: {}
----

<1> `*recreateParams*` are optional.
<2> `*pre*` and `*post*` are both xref:lifecycle-hooks[lifecycle hooks].
====

The Recreate strategy will:

. Execute any "pre" lifecycle hook.
. Scale down the previous deployment to zero.
. Scale up the new deployment.
. Execute any "post" lifecycle hook.

IMPORTANT: During scale up, if the replica count of the deployment is greater
than one, the  first replica of the deployment will be validated for readiness
before fully scaling up the deployment. If the validation of the first replica
fails, the deployment will be considered a failure.

IMPORTANT: When executing the "post" lifecycle hook, all failures will be
ignored regardless of the failure policy specified on the hook.

[[custom-strategy]]

=== Custom Strategy

The Custom strategy allows you to provide your own deployment behavior.

The following is an example of the Custom strategy:

====

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: Custom
  customParams:
    image: organization/strategy
    command: [ "command", "arg1" ]
    environment:
      - name: ENV_1
        value: VALUE_1
----
====

In the above example, the *organization/strategy* Docker image provides the
deployment behavior. The optional `*command*` array overrides any `CMD`
directive specified in the image's *_Dockerfile_*. The optional environment
variables provided are added to the execution environment of the strategy
process.

Additionally, {product-title} provides the following environment variables to the
strategy process:

[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===
|Environment Variable |Description

.^|`*OPENSHIFT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME*`
|The name of the new deployment (a replication controller).

.^|`*OPENSHIFT_DEPLOYMENT_NAMESPACE*`
|The namespace of the new deployment.
|===

The replica count of the new deployment will initially be zero. The
responsibility of the strategy is to make the new deployment active using the
logic that best serves the needs of the user.

[[lifecycle-hooks]]
== Lifecycle Hooks

The xref:recreate-strategy[Recreate] and xref:rolling-strategy[Rolling]
strategies support lifecycle hooks, which allow behavior to be injected into
the deployment process at predefined points within the strategy:

The following is an example of a "pre" lifecycle hook:

====

[source,yaml]
----
pre:
  failurePolicy: Abort
  execNewPod: {} <1>
----

<1> `*execNewPod*` is xref:pod-based-lifecycle-hook[a pod-based lifecycle hook].
====

Every hook has a `*failurePolicy*`, which defines the action the strategy should
take when a hook failure is encountered:

[cols="2,8"]
|===

.^|`*Abort*`
|The deployment process will be considered a failure if the hook fails.

.^|`*Retry*`
|The hook execution should be retried until it succeeds.

.^|`*Ignore*`
|Any hook failure should be ignored and the deployment should proceed.
|===

Hooks have a type-specific field that describes how to execute the hook.
Currently xref:pod-based-lifecycle-hook[pod-based hooks] are the only
supported hook type, specified by the `*execNewPod*` field.

[[pod-based-lifecycle-hook]]
=== Pod-based Lifecycle Hook

Pod-based lifecycle hooks execute hook code in a new pod derived from the
template in a deployment configuration.

The following simplified example deployment configuration uses the
xref:rolling-strategy[Rolling strategy]. Triggers and some other minor details
are omitted for brevity:

====

[source,yaml]
----
kind: DeploymentConfig
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: helloworld
          image: openshift/origin-ruby-sample
  replicas: 5
  selector:
    name: frontend
  strategy:
    type: Rolling
    rollingParams:
      pre:
        failurePolicy: Abort
        execNewPod:
          containerName: helloworld <1>
          command: [ "/usr/bin/command", "arg1", "arg2" ] <2>
          env: <3>
            - name: CUSTOM_VAR1
              value: custom_value1
          volumes:
            - data <4>
----
<1> The `helloworld` name refers to `spec.template.spec.containers[0].name`.
<2> This `*command*` overrides any `ENTRYPOINT` defined by the `openshift/origin-ruby-sample` image.
<3> `*env*` is an optional set of environment variables for the hook container.
<4> `*volumes*` is an optional set of volume references for the hook container.
====

In this example, the "pre" hook will be executed in a new pod using the
*openshift/origin-ruby-sample* image from the *helloworld* container. The hook
pod will have the following properties:

* The hook command will be `/usr/bin/command arg1 arg2`.
* The hook container will have the `CUSTOM_VAR1=custom_value1` environment variable.
* The hook failure policy is `Abort`, meaning the deployment process will fail if the hook fails.
* The hook pod will inherit the `data` volume from the deployment configuration pod.

[[deployment-resources]]
== Deployment Resources

A deployment is completed by a pod that consumes resources (memory and CPU) on a
node. By default, pods consume unbounded node resources. However, if a project
specifies default container limits, then pods consume resources up to those
limits.

You can also limit resource use by specifying resource limits as part of the
deployment strategy. Deployment resources can be used with the Recreate,
Rolling, or Custom deployment strategies.

In the following example, each of `*resources*`, `*cpu*`, and `*memory*` is
optional:

====
[source,yaml]
----
type: "Recreate"
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: "100m" <1>
    memory: "256Mi" <2>
----

<1> `*cpu*` is in CPU units: `100m` represents 0.1 CPU units (100 * 1e-3).
<2> `*memory*` is in bytes: `256Mi` represents 268435456 bytes (256 * 2 ^ 20).
====

However, if a quota has been defined for your project, one of the following two
items is required:

- A `*resources*` section set with an explicit `*requests*`:
+
====
[source,yaml]
----
  type: "Recreate"
  resources:
    requests: <1>
      cpu: "100m"
      memory: "256Mi"
----
<1> The `*requests*` object contains the list of resources that correspond to
the list of resources in the quota.
====

- A xref:../dev_guide/compute_resources.html#dev-limit-ranges[limit range] defined
in your project, where the defaults from the `*LimitRange*` object apply to pods
created during the deployment process.

Otherwise, deploy pod creation will fail, citing a failure to satisfy quota.

[[scaling]]
== Manual Scaling

In addition to rollbacks, you can exercise fine-grained control over
the number of replicas from the web console, or by using the `oc scale` command.
For example, the following command sets the replicas in the deployment
configuration `frontend` to 3.

----
$ oc scale dc frontend --replicas=3
----

The number of replicas eventually propagates to the desired and current
state of the deployment configured by the deployment configuration `frontend`.


[[assigning-pods-to-specific-nodes]]

== Assigning Pods to Specific Nodes

You can use node selectors in conjunction with labeled nodes to control pod
placement.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
[NOTE]
====
{product-title} administrators can assign labels
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.html#configuring-node-host-labels[during
an advanced installation], or
xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.html#updating-labels-on-nodes[added to a node
after installation].
====
endif::[]

Cluster administrators
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
xref:../admin_guide/managing_projects.html#using-node-selectors[can set the
default node selector]
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-online[]
can set the default node selector
endif::[]
for your project in order to restrict pod placement to
specific nodes. As an {product-title} developer, you can set a node selector on a pod
configuration to restrict nodes even further.

To add a node selector when creating a pod, edit the pod configuration, and add
the `nodeSelector` value. This can be added to a single pod configuration, or in
a pod template:

====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    disktype: ssd
...
----
====

Pods created when the node selector is in place are assigned to nodes with the
specified labels.

The labels specified here are used in conjunction with the labels
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
xref:../admin_guide/managing_projects.html#using-node-selectors[added by a
cluster administrator].
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-online[]
added by a cluster administrator.
endif::[]
For example, if a project has the `type=user-node` and
`region=east` labels added to a project by the cluster administrator, and you
add the above `disktype: ssd` label to a pod, the pod will only ever be
scheduled on nodes that have all three labels.

[NOTE]
====
Labels can only be set to one value, so setting a node selector of `region=west`
in a pod configuration that has `region=east` as the administrator-set default,
results in a pod that will never be scheduled.
====
