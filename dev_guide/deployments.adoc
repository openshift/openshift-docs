== Overview

A deployment in OpenShift is a replication controller based on a user defined
template called a deployment configuration. Deployments are created manually
or in response to triggered events.

The deployment system provides:

- A link:#creating-a-deployment-configuration[deployment configuration], which is a template for deployments.
- link:#triggers[Triggers] that drive automated deployments in response to events.
- User-customizable link:#strategies[strategies] to transition from the previous deployment to the new deployment.
- link:#rolling-back-a-deployment[Rollbacks] to a previous deployment.
- Manual replication link:#scaling[scaling].

The deployment configuration contains a version number that is incremented
each time a new deployment is created from that configuration. In addition,
the cause of the last deployment is added to the configuration.

[[creating-a-deployment-configuration]]

== Creating a Deployment Configuration

A deployment configuration consists of the following key parts:

- A replication controller template which describes the application to be deployed.
- The default replica count for the deployment.
- A deployment link:#strategies[strategy] which will be used to execute the deployment.
- A set of link:#triggers[triggers] which cause deployments to be created automatically.

Deployment configurations are `*deploymentConfig*` OpenShift API resources
which can be managed with the `oc` command like any other resource. The
following is an example of a `*deploymentConfig*` resource:

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "kind": "DeploymentConfig",
  "apiVersion": "v1",

  },
  "spec": {

        }
      },

            "ports": [
              {
                "containerPort": 8080,
                "protocol": "TCP"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    "replicas": 5, <2>
    "selector": {
      "name": "frontend"
    },
    "triggers": [
      {
        "type": "ConfigChange" <3>
      },
      {
        "type": "ImageChange", <4>
        "imageChangeParams": {
          "automatic": true,
          "containerNames": [
            "helloworld"
          ],
          "from": {
            "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
            "name": "origin-ruby-sample:latest"
          }
        }
      }
    ],
    "strategy": { <5>
      "type": "Rolling"
    }
  }
}
----

<1> The replication controller template named `frontend` describes a simple Ruby application.
<2> There will be 5 replicas of `frontend` by default.
<3> A link:#config-change-trigger[configuration change trigger] causes a new deployment to be created any time the replication controller template changes.
<4> An link:#image-change-trigger[image change trigger] trigger causes a new deployment to be
created each time a new version of the `origin-ruby-sample:latest` image repository is available.
<5> The link:#rolling-strategy[Rolling strategy] is the default and may be omitted.
====

[[start-deployment]]

== Starting a Deployment

You can start a new deployment manually using the web console, or from the CLI:

----
$ oc deploy <deployment_config> --latest
----

NOTE: If there's already a deployment in progress, the command will display a
message and a new deployment will not be started.

[[viewing-a-deployment]]

== Viewing a Deployment

To get basic information about recent deployments:

----
$ oc deploy <deployment_config>
----

This will show details about the latest and recent deployments, including any
currently running deployment.

For more detailed information about a deployment configuration and the latest deployment:

----
$ oc describe dc <deployment_config>
----

[NOTE]
====
The link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.html#project-overviews[web console]
shows deployments in the *Browse* tab.
====

[[canceling-a-deployment]]

== Canceling a Deployment

To cancel a running or stuck deployment:

----
$ oc deploy <deployment_config> --cancel
----

WARNING: The cancellation is a best-effort operation, and may take some time to
complete. It's possible the deployment will partially or totally complete
before the cancellation is effective.

[[retrying-a-deployment]]

== Retrying a Deployment

To retry the last failed deployment:

----
$ oc deploy <deployment_config> --retry
----

If the last deployment didn't fail, the command will display a message and the
deployment will not be retried.

NOTE: Retrying a deployment restarts the deployment and does not create a new
deployment version. The restarted deployment will have the same configuration
it had when it failed.

[[rolling-back-a-deployment]]

== Rolling Back a Deployment
Rollbacks revert an application back to a previous deployment and can be
performed using the REST API, the CLI, or the web console.

To rollback to the last successful deployment:

----
$ oc rollback <deployment_config>
----

The deployment configuration's template will be reverted to match the
deployment specified in the rollback command, and a new deployment will be
started.

Image change triggers on the deployment configuration are disabled as part of
the rollback to prevent unwanted deployments soon after the rollback is
complete. To re-enable the image change triggers:

----
$ oc deploy <deployment_config> --enable-triggers
----

To roll back to a specific version:

----
$ oc rollback <deployment_config> --to-version=1
----

To see what the rollback would look like without performing the rollback:

----
$ oc rollback <deployment_config> --dry-run
----

[[viewing-deployment-logs]]

== Viewing Deployment Logs

To view the logs of the latest deployment for a given deployment configuration:

----
$ oc logs dc <deployment_config> [--follow]
----

Logs can be retrieved either while the deployment is running or if it has
failed. If the deployment was successful, there will be no logs to view.

You can also view logs from older deployments:

----
$ oc logs --version=1 dc <deployment_config>
----

This command returns the logs from the first deployment of the provided
deployment configuration, if and only if that deployment exists (i.e., it has
failed and has not been manually deleted or pruned).

[[triggers]]

== Triggers

A deployment configuration can contain triggers, which drive the creation of
new deployments in response to events, both inside and outside OpenShift.

WARNING: If no triggers are defined on a deployment configuration, deployments
must be link:#start-deployment[started manually].

[[config-change-trigger]]

=== Configuration Change Trigger

The ConfigChange trigger results in a new deployment whenever changes are
detected to the replication controller template of the deployment configuration.

NOTE: If a ConfigChange trigger is defined on a deployment configuration,
the first deployment will be automatically created soon after the deployment
configuration itself is created.

The following is an example of a ConfigChange trigger:

====

[source,json]
----
"triggers": [
  {
    "type": "ConfigChange"
  }
]
----
====

[[image-change-trigger]]

=== Image Change Trigger

The ImageChange trigger results in a new deployment whenever the value of an
image stream tag changes.

The following is an example of an ImageChange trigger:

====

[source,json]
----
"triggers": [
  {
    "type": "ImageChange",
    "imageChangeParams": {
      "automatic": true, <1>
      "from": {
        "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
        "name": "origin-ruby-sample:latest"
      },
      "containerNames": [
        "helloworld"
      ]
    }
  }
]
----
<1> If the `*automatic*` option is set to `false`, the trigger is disabled.
====

With the above example, when the `latest` tag value of the `origin-ruby-sample`
image stream changes and the new tag value differs from the current image
specified in the deployment configuration's `helloworld` container, a new
deployment is created using the new tag value for the `helloworld` container.

[[strategies]]

== Strategies

A deployment strategy determines the deployment process, and is defined by the
deployment configuration. Each application has different requirements for
availability (and other considerations) during deployments. OpenShift provides
strategies to support a variety of deployment scenarios.

A deployment strategy uses link:../dev_guide/application_health.html[readiness
checks] to determine if a new pod is ready for use. If a readiness check
fails, the deployment is stopped.

The link:#rolling-strategy[Rolling strategy] is the default strategy used if
no strategy is specified on a deployment configuration.

[[rolling-strategy]]

=== Rolling Strategy

The rolling strategy performs a rolling update and supports
link:#lifecycle-hooks[lifecycle hooks] for injecting code into the deployment
process.

The rolling deployment strategy waits for pods to pass their
link:../dev_guide/application_health.html[readiness check] before scaling down
old components, and does not allow pods that do not pass their readiness check
within a configurable timeout.

The following is an example of the Rolling strategy:

====
[source,json]
----
"strategy": {
  "type": "Rolling",
  "rollingParams": {
    "timeoutSeconds": 120, <1>
    "maxSurge": "20%", <2>
    "maxUnavailable": "10%" <3>
    "pre": {}, <4>
    "post": {}
  }
}
----
====

<1> How long to wait for a scaling event before giving up. Optional; the default is 120.
<2> `*maxSurge*` is optional and defaults to `25%`; see below.
<3> `*maxUnavailable*` is optional and defaults to `25%`; see below.
<4> `*pre*` and `*post*` are both link:#lifecycle-hooks[lifecycle hooks].

The Rolling strategy will:

. Execute any `*pre*` lifecycle hook.
. Scale up the new deployment based on the surge configuration.
. Scale down the old deployment based on the max unavailable configuration.
. Repeat this scaling until the new deployment has reached the desired replica
count and the old deployment has been scaled to zero.
. Execute any `*post*` lifecycle hook.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When scaling down, the Rolling strategy waits for pods to become ready so it can
decide whether further scaling would affect availability. If scaled up pods
never become ready, the deployment will eventually time out and result in a
deployment failure.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
When executing the `*post*` lifecycle hook, all failures will be ignored
regardless of the failure policy specified on the hook.
====

The `*maxUnavailable*` parameter is the maximum number of pods that can be
unavailable during the update. The `*maxSurge*` parameter is the maximum number
of pods that can be scheduled above the original number of pods. Both parameters
can be set to either a percentage (e.g.,  *10%*) or an absolute value (e.g.,
*2*). The default value for both is *25%*.

These parameters allow the deployment to be tuned for availability and speed. For
example:

- `*maxUnavailable*=0` and `*maxSurge*=20%` ensures full capacity is maintained
during the update and rapid scale up.
- `*maxUnavailable*=10%` and `*maxSurge*=0` performs an update using no extra
capacity (an in-place update).
- `*maxUnavailable*=10%` and `*maxSurge*=10%` scales up and down quickly with
some potential for capacity loss.

[[recreate-strategy]]

=== Recreate Strategy

The Recreate strategy has basic rollout behavior and supports
link:#lifecycle-hooks[lifecycle hooks] for injecting code into the deployment
process.

The following is an example of the Recreate strategy:

====

[source,json]
----
"strategy": {
  "type": "Recreate",
  "recreateParams": { <1>
    "pre": {}, <2>
    "post": {}
  }
}
----

<1> `*recreateParams*` are optional.
<2> `*pre*` and `*post*` are both link:#lifecycle-hooks[lifecycle hooks].
====

The Recreate strategy will:

. Execute any "pre" lifecycle hook.
. Scale down the previous deployment to zero.
. Scale up the new deployment.
. Execute any "post" lifecycle hook.

IMPORTANT: During scale up, if the replica count of the deployment is greater
than one, the  first replica of the deployment will be validated for readiness
before fully scaling up the deployment. If the validation of the first replica
fails, the deployment will be considered a failure.

IMPORTANT: When executing the "post" lifecycle hook, all failures will be
ignored regardless of the failure policy specified on the hook.

[[custom-strategy]]

=== Custom Strategy

The Custom strategy allows you to provide your own deployment behavior.

The following is an example of the Custom strategy:

====

[source,json]
----
"strategy": {
  "type": "Custom",
  "customParams": {
    "image": "organization/strategy",
    "command": ["command", "arg1"],
    "environment": [
      {
        "name": "ENV_1",
        "value": "VALUE_1"
      }
    ]
  }
}
----
====

In the above example, the *organization/strategy* Docker image provides the
deployment behavior. The optional `*command*` array overrides any `CMD`
directive specified in the image's *_Dockerfile_*. The optional environment
variables provided are added to the execution environment of the strategy
process.

Additionally, OpenShift provides the following environment variables to the
strategy process:

[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===
|Environment Variable |Description

.^|`*OPENSHIFT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME*`
|The name of the new deployment (a replication controller).

.^|`*OPENSHIFT_DEPLOYMENT_NAMESPACE*`
|The namespace of the new deployment.
|===

The replica count of the new deployment will initially be zero. The
responsibility of the strategy is to make the new deployment active using the
logic that best serves the needs of the user.

[[lifecycle-hooks]]

== Lifecycle Hooks

The link:#recreate-strategy[Recreate] and link:#rolling-strategy[Rolling]
strategies support lifecycle hooks, which allow behavior to be injected into
the deployment process at predefined points within the strategy:

The following is an example of a "pre" lifecycle hook:

====

[source,json]
----
"pre": {
  "failurePolicy": "Abort",
  "execNewPod": {} <1>
}
----
<1> `*execNewPod*` is link:#pod-based-lifecycle-hook[a pod-based lifecycle hook].
====

Every hook has a `*failurePolicy*`, which defines the action the strategy should
take when a hook failure is encountered:

[cols="2,8"]
|===

.^|`*Abort*`
|The deployment should be considered a failure if the hook fails.

.^|`*Retry*`
|The hook execution should be retried until it succeeds.

.^|`*Ignore*`
|Any hook failure should be ignored and the deployment should proceed.
|===

WARNING: Some hook points for a strategy might support only a subset of
failure policy values. For example, the link:#recreate-strategy[Recreate] and
link:#rolling-strategy[Rolling] strategies do not currently support the
`*Abort*` policy for a "post" deployment lifecycle hook. Consult the
documentation for a given strategy for details on any restrictions regarding
lifecycle hooks.

Hooks have a type-specific field that describes how to execute the hook.
Currently link:#pod-based-lifecycle-hook[pod-based hooks] are the only
supported hook type, specified by the `*execNewPod*` field.

[[pod-based-lifecycle-hook]]

=== Pod-based Lifecycle Hook

Pod-based lifecycle hooks execute hook code in a new pod derived from the
template in a deployment configuration.

The following simplified example deployment configuration uses the
link:#rolling-strategy[Rolling strategy]. Triggers and some other minor details
are omitted for brevity:

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "kind": "DeploymentConfig",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "frontend"
  },
  "spec": {
    "template": {
      "metadata": {
        "labels": {
          "name": "frontend"
        }
      },
      "spec": {
        "containers": [
          {
            "name": "helloworld",
            "image": "openshift/origin-ruby-sample"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    "replicas": 5,
    "selector": {
      "name": "frontend"
    },
    "strategy": {
      "type": "Rolling",
      "rollingParams": {
        "pre": {
          "failurePolicy": "Abort",
          "execNewPod": {
            "containerName": "helloworld", <1>
            "command": [ <2>
              "/usr/bin/command", "arg1", "arg2"
            ],
            "env": [ <3>
              {
                "name": "CUSTOM_VAR1",
                "value": "custom_value1"
              }
            ],
            "volumes": ["data"] <4>
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----
<1> The `helloworld` name refers to `spec.template.spec.containers[0].name`.
<2> This `*command*` overrides any `ENTRYPOINT` defined by the `openshift/origin-ruby-sample` image.
<3> `*env*` is an optional set of environment variables for the hook container.
<4> `*volumes*` is an optional set of volume references for the hook container.
====

In this example, the "pre" hook will be executed in a new pod using the
*openshift/origin-ruby-sample* image from the *helloworld* container. The hook
pod will have the following properties:

* The hook command will be `/usr/bin/command arg1 arg2`.
* The hook container will have the `CUSTOM_VAR1=custom_value1` environment variable.
* The hook failure policy is `Abort`, meaning the deployment will fail if the hook fails.
* The hook pod will inherit the `data` volume from the deployment configuration pod.

[[deployment-resources]]
== Deployment Resources

A deployment is completed by a pod that consumes resources (memory and CPU) on a
node. By default, pods consume unbounded node resources. However, if a project
specifies default container limits, then pods consume resources up to those
limits.

You can also limit resource use by specifying resource limits as part of the
deployment strategy. Deployment resources can be used with the Recreate,
Rolling, or Custom deployment strategies.

In the following example, each of `*resources*`, `*cpu*`, and `*memory*` is
optional:

====
[source,yaml]
----
type: "Recreate"
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: "100m" <1>
    memory: "256Mi" <2>
----

<1> `*cpu*` is in CPU units: `100m` represents 0.1 CPU units (100 * 1e-3).
<2> `*memory*` is in bytes: `256Mi` represents 268435456 bytes (256 * 2 ^ 20).
====

However, if a quota has been defined for your project, one of the following two
items is required:

- A `*resources*` section set with an explicit `*requests*`:
+
====
[source,yaml]
----
  type: "Recreate"
  resources: 
    requests: <1>
      cpu: "100m"
      memory: "256Mi"
----
<1> The `*requests*` object contains the list of resources that correspond to
the list of resources in the quota.
====

- A link:../dev_guide/limits.html[limit range] defined in your project, where the
defaults from the `*LimitRange*` object apply to pods created during the
deployment process.

Otherwise, deploy pod creation will fail, citing a failure to satisfy quota.

[[scaling]]

== Manual Scaling
In addition to rollbacks, you can exercise fine-grained control over
the number of replicas from the web console, or by using the `oc scale` command.
For example, the following command sets the replicas in the deployment
configuration `frontend` to 3.

----
$ oc scale dc frontend --replicas=3
----

The number of replicas eventually propagates to the desired and current
state of the deployment configured by the deployment configuration `frontend`.


[[assigning-pods-to-specific-nodes]]

== Assigning Pods to Specific Nodes

You can use node selectors in conjunction with labeled nodes to control pod
placement.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
[NOTE]
====
OpenShift administrators can assign labels
link:../install_config/install/advanced_install.html#configuring-node-host-labels[during
an advanced installation], or
link:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.html#updating-labels-on-nodes[added to a node
after installation].
====
endif::[]

Cluster administrators
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
link:../admin_guide/managing_projects.html#using-node-selectors[can set the
default node selector]
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-online[]
can set the default node selector
endif::[]
for your project in order to restrict pod placement to
specific nodes. As an OpenShift developer, you can set a node selector on a pod
configuration to restrict nodes even further.

To add a node selector when creating a pod, edit the pod configuration, and add
the `nodeSelector` value. This can be added to a single pod configuration, or in
a pod template:

====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    disktype: ssd
...
----
====

Pods created when the node selector is in place are assigned to nodes with the
specified labels.

The labels specified here are used in conjunction with the labels
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
link:../admin_guide/managing_projects.html#using-node-selectors[added by a
cluster administrator].
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-online[]
added by a cluster administrator.
endif::[]
For example, if a project has the `type=user-node` and
`region=east` labels added to a project by the cluster administrator, and you
add the above `disktype: ssd` label to a pod, the pod will only ever be
scheduled on nodes that have all three labels.

[NOTE]
====
Labels can only be set to one value, so setting a node selector of `region=west`
in a pod configuration that has `region=east` as the administrator-set default,
results in a pod that will never be scheduled.
====
