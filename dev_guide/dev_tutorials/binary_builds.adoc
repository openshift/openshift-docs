[[binary-builds-introduction]]
== Introduction

The binary build feature in OpenShift allows developers to upload source or
artifacts directly to a build instead of having the build pull source from a Git
repository URL. Any BuildConfig with a strategy of source, Docker, or custom may
be started as a binary build. When starting a build from local artifacts, the
existing source reference is replaced with the source coming from the local
user's machine.

The source may be supplied in several ways which correspond to arguments
available when using the start-build command:

* From a file (`--from-file`): This is the case when the entire source of the
build consists of a single file. For example, it may be a `Dockerfile` for a
Docker build, `pom.xml` for a Wildfly build, or `Gemfile` for a Ruby build.

* From a directory (`--from-directory`): Use this when the source is in a
local directory and is not committed to a Git repository. The `start-build`
command will create an archive of the given directory and upload it to the
builder as source.

* From an archive (`--from-archive`): Use this when an archive with the
source already exists. The archive may be in either `tar`, `tar.gz`, or `zip` format.

* From a Git repository (`--from-repo`): This is for source that is currently part
of a Git repository on the user's local machine. The HEAD commit of the current
repository will be archived and sent to OpenShift for building.

[[binary-builds-use-cases]]
=== Use Cases

Binary builds remove the requirement for a build to pull source from an existing
Git repository. Reasons to use binary builds include:

* Building and testing local code changes. Source from a public repository can be
cloned and local changes can be uploaded to OpenShift for building. Local
changes do not have to be committed or pushed anywhere.

* Building private code. New builds can be started from scratch as binary builds.
The source can then be uploaded directly from your local workstation to
OpenShift without having to check it in to an SCM.

* Building images with artifacts from other sources. With Jenkins pipelines,
binary builds are useful to combine artifacts built with tools such as Maven or C
compiler, and runtime images that make use of those builds.

[[binary-builds-limitations]]
=== Limitations

* Binary builds are not repeatable. Because binary builds rely on the user
uploading artifacts at build start, OpenShift cannot repeat the same build
without the user repeating the same upload every time.

* Binary builds cannot be triggered automatically. They can only be started
manually when the user uploads the required binary artifacts.

[NOTE]
====
Builds that are started as binary builds may also have a configured source URL.
If that's the case, triggers will successfully launch the build but source will
come from the configured source URL and not from what was supplied by the user
the last time the build ran.

[[binary-builds-tutorial-overview]]
== Tutorials Overview

The following tutorials assume that you have an OpenShift cluster available and
that you have a project where you can create artifacts. It requires that you
have both `git` and `oc` available locally.


[[binary-builds-local-code-changes]]
=== Tutorial: Building local code changes

. Create a new application based on an existing source repository and create a
route for it:
+
----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git
$ oc expose svc/ruby-hello-world
----

. Wait for the initial build to complete and view the application's page by
navigating to the route's host. You should get a welcome page:
+
----
$ oc get route ruby-hello-world
----

. Clone the repository locally:
+
----
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git
$ cd ruby-hello-world
----

. Make a change to the application's view. Using your favorite editor, edit
`views/main.rb`: Change the `<body>` tag to `<body
style="background-color:blue">`.

. Start a new build with your locally-modified source. From the repository's
  local directory, run:

  ----
  $ oc start-build ruby-hello-world --from-dir="." --follow
  ----

Once your build has completed and the application has redeployed, navigating to
the application's route host should result in a page with a blue background.

You can keep making changes locally and building your code with `oc start-build
--from-dir`.

You can also create a branch of the code, commit your changes locally, and use
the repository's HEAD as the source for your build:

----
$ git checkout -b my_branch
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "My changes"
$ oc start-build ruby-hello-world --from-repo="." --follow
----

[[binary-builds-private-code]]
=== Tutorial: Building private code

. Create a local directory to hold your code:
+
----
$ mkdir myapp
$ cd myapp
----

. In the directory create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content:
+
----
FROM centos:centos7

EXPOSE 8080

COPY index.html /var/run/web/index.html

CMD cd /var/run/web && python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
----

. Create a file named `index.html` with the following content:
+
----
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My local app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This is my local application</p>
  </body>
</html>
----

. Create a new build for your application:
+
----
$ oc new-build --strategy docker --binary --docker-image centos:centos7 --name myapp
----

. Start a binary build using the local directory's content:
+
----
$ oc start-build myapp --from-dir . --follow
----

. Deploy the application using `new-app`, then create a route for it:
+
----
$ oc new-app myapp
$ oc expose svc/myapp
----

. Get the host name for your route and navigate to it:
+
----
$ oc get route myapp
----

After having built and deployed your code, you can iterate by making changes to
your local files and starting new builds by invoking `oc start-build myapp
--from-dir`. Once built, the code will be automatically deployed and the
changes will be reflected in your browser when you refresh the page.

[[binary-builds-pipeline-binary-artifacts]]
=== Tutorial: Binary artifacts from pipeline

Jenkins on OpenShift allows using slave images with the appropriate tools to
build your code. For example, you can use the `maven` slave to build a WAR from
your code repository. However, once this artifact is built, you need to commit
it to an image that contains the right runtime artifacts to run your code. A
binary build may be used to add these artifacts to your runtime image. In the
following tutorial, we'll create a Jenkins pipeline that makes use of the `maven`
slave to build a WAR, and then uses a binary build with a `Dockerfile` to add that
WAR to a wildfly runtime image.

. Create a new directory for your application:
+
----
$ mkdir mavenapp
$ cd mavenapp
----

. Create a `Dockerfile` that copies a WAR to the appropriate location inside a
wildfly image for execution. Copy the following to a local file named
`Dockerfile`:
+
----
FROM wildfly:latest
COPY ROOT.war /wildfly/standalone/deployments/ROOT.war
CMD  $STI_SCRIPTS_PATH/run
----

. Create a new BuildConfig for that Dockerfile:
+
[NOTE]
====
This will automatically start a build that will initially fail because the
`ROOT.war` artifact is not yet available. The pipeline below will pass that WAR to
the build using a binary build.
====
+
----
$ cat Dockerfile | oc new-build -D - --name mavenapp
----

. Create a BuildConfig with the Jenkins pipeline that will build a WAR and then
use that WAR to build an image using the previously created `Dockerfile`. The
same pattern can be used for other platforms where a binary artifact is built by
a set of tools and is then combined with a different runtime image for the final
package. Save the following code to `mavenapp-pipeline.yml`:
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
  name: mavenapp-pipeline
spec:
  strategy:
    jenkinsPipelineStrategy:
      jenkinsfile: |-
        pipeline {
          agent { label "maven" }
          stages {
            stage("Clone Source") {
              steps {
                checkout([$class: 'GitSCM',
                            branches: [[name: '*/master']],
                            extensions: [
                              [$class: 'RelativeTargetDirectory', relativeTargetDir: 'mavenapp']
                            ],
                            userRemoteConfigs: [[url: 'https://github.com/openshift/openshift-jee-sample.git']]
                        ])
              }
            }
            stage("Build WAR") {
              steps {
                dir('mavenapp') {
                  sh 'mvn clean package -Popenshift'
                }
              }
            }
            stage("Build Image") {
              steps {
                dir('mavenapp/target') {
                  sh 'oc start-build mavenapp --from-dir . --follow'
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
    type: JenkinsPipeline
  triggers: []
----

. Create the pipeline build. If Jenkins is not deployed to your project, creating
the BuildConfig with the pipeline will result in Jenkins getting deployed. It
may take a couple of minutes before Jenkins is ready to build your pipeline. You
can check the status of the Jenkins rollout by invoking, `oc rollout status
dc/jenkins`:
+
----
$ oc create -f ./mavenapp-pipeline.yml
----

. Once Jenkins is ready, start the pipeline defined previously:
+
----
$ oc start-build mavenapp-pipeline
----

. When the pipeline has finished building, deploy the new application using
new-app and expose its route:
+
----
$ oc new-app mavenapp
$ oc expose svc/mavenapp
----

. Using your browser, navigate to the route for the application:
+
----
$ oc get route mavenapp
----
