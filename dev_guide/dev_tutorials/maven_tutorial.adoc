[[nexus-introduction]]
== Introduction

While developing your application with Java and Maven, you will most likely be
building many times. In order to shorten the build times of your pods, Maven
dependencies can be cached in a local Nexus repository. This tutorial will
guide you through creating a Nexus repository on your cluster.

This tutorial assumes that you are working with a project that is already set
up for use with Maven. If you are interested in using Maven with your Java
project, it is highly recommended that you look at
link:https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html[their guide].

In addition, be sure to check your application's image for Maven mirror
capabilities. Many images that use Maven have a `*MAVEN_MIRROR_URL*` environment
variable that you can use to simplify this process. If it does not have this
capability, read
link:https://books.sonatype.com/nexus-book/reference/config.html[the Nexus documentation]
to configure your build properly.

Furthermore, make sure that you give each pod enough resources to function. You
may have to
xref:../../dev_guide/deployments/how_deployments_work.adoc#creating-a-deployment-configuration[edit the pod
template] in the Nexus deployment configuration to request more resources.

[[nexus-setting-up-nexus]]
== Setting up Nexus

. Download and deploy the official Nexus container image:
+
----
oc new-app sonatype/nexus
----

. Create a route by exposing the newly created Nexus service:
+
----
oc expose svc/nexus
----

. Use *oc get routes* to find the pod's new external address.
+
----
oc get routes
----
+
The output should resemble:
+
----
NAME      HOST/PORT                              PATH      SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION
nexus     nexus-myproject.192.168.1.173.xip.io             nexus      8081-tcp
----

. Confirm that Nexus is running by navigating your browser to the URL under
*HOST/PORT*. To sign in to Nexus, the default administrator username is *admin*,
and the password is *admin123*.

[NOTE]
====
Nexus comes pre-configured for the Central Repository, but you may need others
for your application. For many Red Hat images, it is recommended to link:https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/[add the
*jboss-ga* repository] at link:https://books.sonatype.com/nexus-book/reference/config-maven.html[Maven repository].

[[nexus-using-probes-to-check-for-success]]
=== Using Probes to Check for Success

This is a good time to set up
xref:../../dev_guide/application_health.adoc#dev-guide-application-health[readiness
and liveness probes]. These will periodically check to see that Nexus is running
properly.

----
$ oc set probe dc/nexus \
	--liveness \
	--failure-threshold 3 \
	--initial-delay-seconds 30 \
	-- echo ok
$ oc set probe dc/nexus \
	--readiness \
	--failure-threshold 3 \
	--initial-delay-seconds 30 \
	--get-url=http://:8081/nexus/content/groups/public

[[nexus-adding-persistence-to-nexus]]
=== Adding Persistence to Nexus

[NOTE]
====
If you do not want persistent storage, continue to
xref:nexus-connecting-to-nexus[Connecting to Nexus]. However, your cached
dependencies and any configuration customization will be lost if the pod is
restarted for any reason.
====

Create a persistent volume claim (PVC) for Nexus, so that the cached
dependencies are not lost when the pod running the server terminates. PVCs
require available persistent volumes (PV) in the cluster. If there are no PVs
available and you do not have administrator access on your cluster, ask your
system administrator to create a Read/Write Persistent Volume for you.
ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
Otherwise, see
xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/index.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-index[Persistent Storage in {product-title}] for
instructions on creating a persistent volume.
endif::[]

Add a PVC to the Nexus deployment configuration.

----
$ oc volumes dc/nexus --add \
	--name 'nexus-volume-1' \
	--type 'pvc' \
	--mount-path '/sonatype-work/' \
	--claim-name 'nexus-pv' \
	--claim-size '1G' \
	--overwrite
----

This removes the previous *emptyDir* volume for the deployment config and adds a
claim for one gigabyte of persistent storage mounted at `/sonatype-work`, which
is where the dependencies will be stored. Due to the change in configuration,
the Nexus pod will be redeployed automatically.

To verify that Nexus is running, refresh the Nexus page in your browser. You can
monitor the deployment's progress using:

----
$ oc get pods -w
----

[[nexus-connecting-to-nexus]]
== Connecting to Nexus

The next steps demonstrate defining a build that uses the new Nexus repository.
The rest of the tutorial uses link:https://github.com/openshift/jee-ex.git[this
example repository] with *wildfly-100-centos7* as a builder, but these changes
should work for any project.

The link:https://github.com/openshift/jee-ex.git[example builder image] supports
`*MAVEN_MIRROR_URL*` as part of its environment, so we can use this to point our
builder image to our Nexus repository. If your image does not support consuming
an environment variable to configure a Maven mirror, you may need to modify the
builder image to provide the correct Maven settings to point to the Nexus
mirror.

----
$ oc new-build openshift/wildfly-100-centos7:latest~https://github.com/openshift/jee-ex.git \
	-e MAVEN_MIRROR_URL='http://nexus.<Nexus_Project>:8081/nexus/content/groups/public'
$ oc logs build/jee-ex-1 --follow
----

Replace `<Nexus_Project>` with the project name of the Nexus repository. If it
is in the same project as the application that is using it, you can remove the
`<Nexus_Project>.`.

[[nexus-confirming-success]]
== Confirming Success

In your web browser, navigate to *_\http://<NexusIP>:8081/nexus/content/groups/public_* to confirm that it has stored your
application's dependencies. You can also check the build logs to see if Maven is
using the Nexus mirror. If successful, you should see output referencing the URL
*_\http://nexus:8081_*.
