== Overview

PodDisruptionBudget are part of the link:http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/disruptions/[Kubernetes] API,
which can be managed with `oc` commands like other xref:../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#object-types[object types].
They allow specifying safety constraints on pods during operations such as
draining a node for maintenance or alike.

== Creating a PodDisruptionBudget

A PodDisruptionBudget configuration consists of the following key parts:

* A label selector, which is a label query over a set of pods.
* An availability level, which specifies the minimum number of pods that must be
 available simultaneously.

The following is an example of a `*PodDisruptionBudget*` resource:

====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy/v1alpha1   <1>
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: foo
spec:
  selector:                   <2>
    matchLabels:
      foo: bar
  minAvailable: 2             <3>
----

1. PodDisruptionBudget are part of the *policy/v1alpha* API group.
2. A label query over a set of resources. The result of matchLabels and
 matchExpressions are ANDed.
3. The minimum number of pods that must be available simultaneously.  This
 can be either an integer or a string specifying a percentage, e.g. "20%".
====

The PodDisruptionBudget is considered healthy when there are at least `*minAvailable*`
Pods running in the system. Every Pod above the aforementioned limit can be
