== Overview

Using xref:dev-quotas[quotas] and xref:dev-limit-ranges[limit ranges], cluster
administrators can set constraints to limit the number of objects or amount of
compute resources that are used in your project. This helps cluster
administrators better manage and allocate resources across all projects, and
ensure that no projects are using more than is appropriate for the cluster size.

As a developer, you can also
set xref:dev-compute-resources[requests and limits on compute resources] at the
pod and container level.

{product-title} Pro project owners can change quotas for their project, but not
limit ranges. {product-title} Starter users cannot modify quotas or limit ranges.

The following sections help you understand how to check on your quota and limit
range settings, what sorts of things they can constrain, and how you can request
or limit compute resources in your own pods and containers.

Quotas are set by cluster administrators and are scoped to a given project.

Full quota definitions can be viewed by running `oc get --export` on the object. The
following show some sample quota definitions:

[[dev-compute-resources]]
== Compute Resources

Each container running on a node consumes compute resources, which are
measurable quantities that can be requested, allocated, and consumed.

When authoring a pod configuration file, you can optionally specify how much
CPU, memory (RAM), and local ephemeral storage (if your administrator
enabled the ephemeral storage technology preview) each
container needs in order to better schedule pods in the cluster and ensure
satisfactory performance.

CPU is measured in units called millicores. Each node in a cluster inspects the
operating system to determine the amount of CPU cores on the node, then
multiplies that value by 1000 to express its total capacity. For example, if a
node has 2 cores, the node's CPU capacity would be represented as 2000m. If you
wanted to use 1/10 of a single core, it would be represented as 100m.

Memory and ephemeral storage are measured in bytes. In addition, it may be used with SI suffixes (E, P,
T, G, M, K) or their power-of-two-equivalents (Ei, Pi, Ti, Gi, Mi, Ki).

[[dev-cpu-requests]]
=== CPU Requests

Each container in a pod can specify the amount of CPU it requests on a node. The
scheduler uses CPU requests to find a node with an appropriate fit for a
container.

The CPU request represents a minimum amount of CPU that your container may
consume, but if there is no contention for CPU, it can use all available CPU on
the node. If there is CPU contention on the node, CPU requests provide a
relative weight across all containers on the system for how much CPU time the
container may use.

On the node, CPU requests map to Kernel CFS shares to enforce this behavior.

ifdef::openshift-online[]
[NOTE]
====
In {product-title}, CPU requests are set automatically based on the memory limit specified. If no memory limit is specified, a CPU request of `60m` is set.

[[dev-cpu-limits]]
=== CPU Limits

Each container in a pod can specify the amount of CPU it is limited to use on a node. CPU limits control the maximum amount of CPU that your container may use independent of contention on the node. If a container attempts to exceed the specified limit, the system will throttle the container. This allows the container to have a consistent level of service independent of the number of pods scheduled to the node.

ifdef::openshift-online[]
[NOTE]
====
In {product-title}, CPU limits are set automatically based on the memory limit specified. If no memory limit is specified, a CPU limit of `1` core is set.
====
endif::[]

[[dev-memory-requests]]
=== Memory Requests

By default, a container is able to consume as much memory on the node as possible. In order to improve placement of pods in the cluster, specify the amount of memory required for a container to run. The scheduler will then take available node memory capacity into account prior to binding your pod to a node. A container is still able to consume as much memory on the node as possible even when specifying a request.

ifdef::openshift-online[]
[NOTE]
====
In {product-title}, memory requests are set automatically based on the memory limit specified. If no memory limit is specified, a memory request of `307Mi` is assumed.
====
endif::[]

[[dev-ephemeral-storage-requests]]
=== Ephemeral Storage Requests

[NOTE]
====
This topic applies only if your administrator enabled the ephemeral storage technology preview.
====

By default, a container is able to consume as much local ephemeral storage on the node as is available. In order to improve placement of pods in the cluster, specify the amount of required local ephemeral storage for a container to run. The scheduler will then take available node local storage capacity into account prior to binding your pod to a node. A container is still able to consume as much local ephemeral storage on the node as possible even when specifying a request.

[[dev-memory-limits]]
=== Memory Limits

If you specify a memory limit, you can constrain the amount of memory the container can use. For example, if you specify a limit of 200Mi, a container will be limited to using that amount of memory on the node. If the container exceeds the specified memory limit, it will be terminated and potentially restarted dependent upon the container restart policy.
ifdef::openshift-online[]
[NOTE]
====
In {product-title}, the memory request, CPU request, and CPU limit will automatically be determined and set appropriately based off of the specified memory limit. If no memory limit is specified, a memory limit of `512Mi` is assumed.
====
endif::[]

[[dev-ephemeral-storage-limits]]
=== Ephemeral Storage Limits

[NOTE]
====
This topic applies only if your administrator enabled the ephemeral storage technology preview.
====

If you specify an ephemeral storage limit, you can constrain the amount of ephemeral storage the container can use. For example, if you specify a limit of 2Gi, a container will be limited to using that amount of ephemeral storage on the node. If the container exceeds the specified memory limit, it will be terminated and potentially restarted dependent upon the container restart policy.

[[quality-of-service-tiers]]
=== Quality of Service Tiers

When created, a compute resource is classified with a _quality of service_
(QoS). There are three tiers, and each is based on the request and limit value
specified for each resource:

[cols="3,8",options="header"]
|===
|*Quality of Service*
|*Description*

|*BestEffort*
|Provided when a request and limit are not specified.

|*Burstable*
|Provided when a request is specified that is less than an optionally specified
limit.

|*Guaranteed*
|Provided when a limit is specified that is equal to an optionally specified
request.
|===

If a container has requests and limits set that would result in a different quality of service for each compute resource, it will be classified as *Burstable*.

The quality of service has different impacts on different resources, depending
on whether the resource is compressible or not. CPU is a compressible resource,
whereas memory is an incompressible resource.

With CPU Resources: ::
- A *BestEffort CPU* container is able to consume as much CPU as is available on
a node but runs with the lowest priority.
- A *Burstable CPU* container is guaranteed to get the minimum amount of CPU
requested, but it may or may not get additional CPU time. Excess CPU resources
are distributed based on the amount requested across all containers on the node.
- A *Guaranteed CPU* container is guaranteed to get the amount requested and no
more, even if there are additional CPU cycles available. This provides a
consistent level of performance independent of other activity on the node.

With Memory Resources: ::
- A *BestEffort memory* container is able to consume as much memory as is
available on the node, but there are no guarantees that the scheduler will place
that container on a node with enough memory to meet its needs. In addition, a
*BestEffort* container has the greatest chance of being killed if there
is an out of memory event on the node.
- A *Burstable memory* container is scheduled on the node to get the amount of
memory requested, but it may consume more. If there is an out of memory event on
the node, *Burstable* containers are killed after *BestEffort* containers when
attempting to recover memory.
- A *Guaranteed memory* container gets the amount of memory requested, but no
more. In the event of an out of memory event, it will only be killed if there
are no more *BestEffort* or *Burstable* containers on the system.
