[[source-to-image-strategy-options]]
== Source-to-Image Strategy Options

The following options are specific to the
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#source-build[S2I
build strategy].

[[s2i-force-pull]]
=== Force Pull

By default, if the builder image specified in the build configuration is
available locally on the node, that image will be used. However, to override the
local image and refresh it from the registry to which the image stream points,
create a `BuildConfig` with the `forcePull` flag set to *true*:

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "builder-image:latest" <1>
    forcePull: true <2>
----
<1> The builder image being used, where the local version on the node may not be
up to date with the version in the registry to which the image stream points.
<2> This flag causes the local builder image to be ignored and a fresh version
to be pulled from the registry to which the image stream points. Setting
`forcePull` to *false* results in the default behavior of honoring the image
stored locally.

[[incremental-builds]]
=== Incremental Builds

S2I can perform incremental builds, which means it reuses artifacts from
previously-built images. To create an incremental build, create a
`BuildConfig` with the following modification to the strategy definition:

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "incremental-image:latest" <1>
    incremental: true <2>
----
<1> Specify an image that supports incremental builds. Consult the
documentation of the builder image to determine if it supports this behavior.
<2> This flag controls whether an incremental build is attempted. If the builder
image does not support incremental builds, the build will still succeed, but you
will get a log message stating the incremental build was not successful because
of a missing *_save-artifacts_* script.

[NOTE]
====
See the xref:../../creating_images/s2i.adoc#creating-images-s2i[S2I Requirements] topic for information
on how to create a builder image supporting incremental builds.
====


[[extended-builds]]
=== Extended Builds

[NOTE]
====
This feature is in technology preview. This means the API may change without
notice or the feature may be removed entirely. For a supported mechanism to
produce application images with runtime-only content, consider using the
xref:build_inputs.adoc#image-source[Image Source] feature and defining two
builds, one which produces an image containing the runtime artifacts and a
second build which consumes the runtime artifacts from that image and adds them
to a runtime-only image.
====

For compiled languages (Go, C, C++, Java, etc.) the dependencies necessary for
compilation might increase the size of the image or introduce vulnerabilities
that can be exploited.

To avoid these problems, S2I (Source-to-Image) introduces a two-image build process
that allows an application to be built via the normal flow in a builder image,
but then injects the resulting application artifacts into a runtime-only image
for execution.

To offer flexibility in this process, S2I executes an `assemble-runtime`
script inside the runtime image that allows further customization of the
resulting runtime image.

More information about this can be found in the official
https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/blob/master/docs/runtime_image.md[S2I
extended builds documents].

This feature is available only for the source strategy.

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: "Source"
  sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "builder-image:latest"
    runtimeImage: <1>
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "runtime-image:latest"
    runtimeArtifacts: <2>
      - sourcePath: "/path/to/source"
        destinationDir: "path/to/destination"
----
<1> The runtime image that the artifacts should be copied to.
This is the final image that the application will run on. This image should
contain the minimum application dependencies to run the injected content from
the builder image.
<2> The runtime artifacts are a mapping of artifacts produced in the builder
image that should be injected into the runtime image.
`sourcePath` can be the full path to a file or directory inside the builder
image.
`destinationDir` must be a directory inside the runtime image where the
artifacts will be copied. This directory is relative to the specified
*WORKDIR* inside that image.

[NOTE]
====
In the current implementation, you cannot have incremental extended builds thus,
the *incremental* option is not valid with `runtimeImage`.
====

If the runtime image needs authentication to be pulled across OpenShift
projects or from another private registry, the details can be specified
xref:../managing_images.adoc#using-image-pull-secrets[within the image pull secret configuration].

[[dev-guide-testing-your-application]]
==== Testing your Application

Extended builds offer two ways of running tests against your application.

The first option is to install all test dependencies and run the tests inside
your _builder image_ since that image, in the context of extended builds, will
not be pushed to a registry. This can be done as a part of the `assemble`
script for the builder image.

The second option is to specify a script via the
xref:build_hooks.adoc#dev-guide-build-hooks[postcommit hook]. This is executed
in an ephemeral container based on the runtime image, thus it is not committed
to the image.

[[override-builder-image-scripts]]
=== Overriding Builder Image Scripts

You can override the *_assemble_*, *_run_*, and *_save-artifacts_*
xref:../../creating_images/s2i.adoc#s2i-scripts[S2I scripts] provided by the
builder image in one of two ways. Either:

1. Provide an *_assemble_*, *_run_*, and/or *_save-artifacts_* script in the
*_.s2i/bin_* directory of your application source repository, or

2. Provide a URL of a directory containing the scripts as part of the strategy
definition. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "builder-image:latest"
    scripts: "http://somehost.com/scripts_directory" <1>
----
<1> This path will have *_run_*, *_assemble_*, and *_save-artifacts_* appended
to it. If any or all scripts are found they will be used in place of the same
named script(s) provided in the image.

[NOTE]
====
Files located at the `scripts` URL take precedence over files located in
*_.s2i/bin_* of the source repository. See the
xref:../../creating_images/s2i.adoc#creating-images-s2i[S2I Requirements] topic and the
link:https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/blob/master/docs/builder_image.md#sti-scripts[S2I
documentation] for information on how S2I scripts are used.
====

[[configuring-the-source-environment]]
=== Environment Variables

There are two ways to make environment variables available to the
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#source-build[source build]
process and resulting \image: xref:environment-files[environment files] and
xref:buildconfig-environment[*BuildConfig* environment] values.

[[environment-files]]
==== Environment Files
Source build enables you to set environment values (one per line) inside your
application, by specifying them in a *_.s2i/environment_* file in the source
repository. The environment variables specified in this file are present during
the build process and in the final container image. The complete list of supported
environment variables is available in the
xref:../../using_images/index.adoc#using-images-index[documentation] for each image.

If you provide a *_.s2i/environment_* file in your source repository, S2I reads
this file during the build. This allows customization of the build behavior as
the *_assemble_* script may use these variables.

For example, if you want to disable assets compilation for your Rails
application, you can add `DISABLE_ASSET_COMPILATION=true` in the
*_.s2i/environment_* file to cause assets compilation to be skipped during the
build.

In addition to builds, the specified environment variables are also available in
the running application itself. For example, you can add
`RAILS_ENV=development` to the *_.s2i/environment_* file to cause the Rails
application to start in `development` mode instead of `production`.

[[buildconfig-environment]]
==== BuildConfig Environment

You can add environment variables to the `sourceStrategy` definition of the
`BuildConfig`. The environment variables defined there are visible during the
*_assemble_* script execution and will be defined in the output image, making
them also available to the *_run_* script and application code.

For example disabling assets compilation for your Rails application:

[source,yaml]
----
sourceStrategy:
...
  env:
    - name: "DISABLE_ASSET_COMPILATION"
      value: "true"
----

You can also manage environment variables defined in the `BuildConfig` with the
xref:../../dev_guide/environment_variables.adoc#dev-guide-environment-variables[`oc set env`] command.

[[adding-secrets-to-source-strategy-build-configs]]
=== Adding Secrets via Web Console

To add a secret to your build configuration so that it can access a private
repository:

. Create a new {product-title} project.

. xref:../../dev_guide/secrets.adoc#dev-guide-secrets[Create a secret] that contains
credentials for accessing a private source code repository.

. Create a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#source-build[Source-to-Image (S2I)
build configuration].

. On the build configuration editor page or in the `create app from builder image` page of the
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-web-console[web
console], set the *Source Secret*.

. Click the *Save* button.

[[enabling-pulling-and-pushing]]
==== Enabling Pulling and Pushing

Enable pulling to a private registry by setting the `Pull Secret` in the build
configuration and enable pushing by setting the `Push Secret`.

[[ignoring-source-files]]
=== Ignoring Source Files
Source to image supports a `.s2iignore` file, which contains a list of file
patterns that should be ignored. Files in the build working directory, as
provided by the various xref:../dev_guide/builds/build_inputs.adoc#dev-guide-build-inputs[input
sources], that match a pattern found in the `.s2iignore` file will not be made
available to the `assemble` script.

For more details on the format of the `.s2iignore` file, see the link:https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image#build-workflow[source-to-image documentation].

[[docker-strategy-options]]
== Docker Strategy Options

The following options are specific to the
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#docker-build[Docker
build strategy].


[[docker-strategy-from]]
=== FROM Image

The `FROM` instruction of the *_Dockerfile_* will be replaced by the `from` of the `BuildConfig`:

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  dockerStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "debian:latest"
----

[[dockerfile-path]]
=== Dockerfile Path

By default, Docker builds use a Dockerfile (named *_Dockerfile_*) located at the
root of the context specified in the `BuildConfig.spec.source.contextDir`
field.

The `dockerfilePath` field allows the build to use a different path to
locate your Dockerfile, relative to the `BuildConfig.spec.source.contextDir`
field. It can be simply a different file name other than the default
*_Dockerfile_* (for example, *_MyDockerfile_*), or a path to a Dockerfile in a
subdirectory (for example, *_dockerfiles/app1/Dockerfile_*):

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  dockerStrategy:
    dockerfilePath: dockerfiles/app1/Dockerfile
----

[[no-cache]]
=== No Cache

Docker builds normally reuse cached layers found on the host performing the
build. Setting the `noCache` option to *true* forces the build to ignore
cached layers and rerun all steps of the *_Dockerfile_*:

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  dockerStrategy:
    noCache: true
----

[[docker-force-pull]]
=== Force Pull

By default, if the builder image specified in the build configuration is
available locally on the node, that image will be used. However, to override the
local image and refresh it from the registry to which the image stream points,
create a `BuildConfig` with the `forcePull` flag set to *true*:

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  dockerStrategy:
    forcePull: true <1>
----
<1> This flag causes the local builder image to be ignored, and a fresh version
to be pulled from the registry to which the image stream points. Setting
`forcePull` to *false* results in the default behavior of honoring the image
stored locally.

[[docker-strategy-environment]]
=== Environment Variables

To make environment variables available to the
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#docker-build[Docker build]
process and resulting image, you can add environment variables to the
`dockerStrategy` definition of the `BuildConfig`.

The environment variables defined there are inserted as a single `ENV`
Dockerfile instruction right after the `FROM` instruction, so that it can be
referenced later on within the Dockerfile.

The variables are defined during build and stay in the output image, therefore
they will be present in any container that runs that image as well.

For example, defining a custom HTTP proxy to be used during build and runtime:

[source,yaml]
----
dockerStrategy:
...
  env:
    - name: "HTTP_PROXY"
      value: "http://myproxy.net:5187/"
----

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
Cluster administrators can also
xref:../../install_config/http_proxies.adoc#configuring-hosts-for-proxies-using-ansible[configure
global build settings using Ansible].
endif::[]

You can also manage environment variables defined in the `BuildConfig` with the
xref:../../dev_guide/environment_variables.adoc#dev-guide-environment-variables[`oc set env`] command.

[[adding-secrets-to-docker-strategy-build-configs]]
=== Adding Secrets via Web Console

To add a secret to your build configuration so that it can access a private
repository"

. Create a new {product-title} project.

. xref:../../dev_guide/secrets.adoc#dev-guide-secrets[Create a secret] that contains
credentials for accessing a private source code repository.

. Create a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#docker-build[docker
build configuration].

. On the build configuration editor page or in the *fromimage* page of the
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-web-console[web
console], set the *Source Secret*.

. Click the *Save* button.


[[docker-strategy-build-args]]
=== Docker Build Arguments

To set link:http://docs.docker.com/v1.7/reference/api/hub_registry_spec/#docker-registry-1-0[Docker build arguments], add entries to the `BuildArgs` array, which is located in the `dockerStrategy` definition of the `BuildConfig`. For example:

====
[source,yaml]
----
dockerStrategy:
...
  buildArgs:
    - name: "foo"
      value: "bar"
----
====

The build arguments will be passed to Docker when a build is started.

==== Enabling Pulling and Pushing

Enable pulling to a private registry by setting the `Pull Secret` in the build
configuration and enable pushing by setting the `Push Secret`.

[[custom-strategy-options]]
== Custom Strategy Options

The following options are specific to the
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#custom-build[Custom
build strategy].

[[custom-strategy-from]]
=== FROM Image

Use the `customStrategy.from` section to indicate the image to use for the
custom build:

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  customStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "DockerImage"
      name: "openshift/sti-image-builder"
----

[[expose-docker-socket]]
=== Exposing the Docker Socket

In order to allow the running of Docker commands and the building of container
images from inside the container, the build container must be bound to an
accessible socket. To do so, set the `exposeDockerSocket` option to *true*:

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  customStrategy:
    exposeDockerSocket: true
----

[[custom-secrets]]
=== Secrets

In addition to xref:../../dev_guide/secrets.adoc#dev-guide-secrets[secrets] for
xref:build_inputs.adoc#source-clone-secrets[source] and
xref:build_inputs.adoc#using-docker-credentials-for-private-registries[images] that can
be added to all build types, custom strategies allow adding an arbitrary list of
secrets to the builder pod.

Each secret can be mounted at a specific location:

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  customStrategy:
    secrets:
      - secretSource: <1>
          name: "secret1"
        mountPath: "/tmp/secret1" <2>
      - secretSource:
          name: "secret2"
        mountPath: "/tmp/secret2"
----
<1> `secretSource` is a reference to a secret in the same namespace as the
build.
<2> `mountPath` is the path inside the custom builder where the secret should
be mounted.

[[adding-secrets-to-custom-strategy-build-configs]]
==== Adding Secrets via Web Console

To add a secret to your build configuration so that it can access a private
repository:

. Create a new {product-title} project.

. xref:../../dev_guide/secrets.adoc#dev-guide-secrets[Create a secret] that contains
credentials for accessing a private source code repository.

. Create a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#custom-build[custom
build configuration].

. On the build configuration editor page or in the *fromimage* page of the
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-web-console[web
console], set the *Source Secret*.

. Click the *Save* button.

[[enabling-pulling-and-pushing]]
==== Enabling Pulling and Pushing

Enable pulling to a private registry by setting the `Pull Secret` in the build
configuration and enable pushing by setting the `Push Secret`.

[[custom-force-pull]]
=== Force Pull

By default, when setting up the build pod, the build controller checks if the
image specified in the build configuration is available locally on the node.  If
so, that image will be used.  However, to override the local image and refresh
it from the registry to which the image stream points, create a `BuildConfig`
with the `forcePull` flag set to *true*:

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  customStrategy:
    forcePull: true <1>
----
<1> This flag causes the local builder image to be ignored, and a fresh version
to be pulled from the registry to which the image stream points. Setting
`forcePull` to *false* results in the default behavior of honoring the image
stored locally.

[[custom-strategy-environment]]
=== Environment Variables

To make environment variables available to the
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#custom-build[Custom build]
process, you can add environment variables to the `customStrategy` definition
of the `BuildConfig`.

The environment variables defined there are passed to the pod that runs the
custom build.

For example, defining a custom HTTP proxy to be used during build:

[source,yaml]
----
customStrategy:
...
  env:
    - name: "HTTP_PROXY"
      value: "http://myproxy.net:5187/"

----

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
Cluster administrators can also
xref:../../install_config/http_proxies.adoc#configuring-hosts-for-proxies-using-ansible[configure
global build settings using Ansible].
endif::[]

You can also manage environment variables defined in the `BuildConfig` with the
xref:../../dev_guide/environment_variables.adoc#dev-guide-environment-variables[`oc set env`] command.
endif::[]

[[pipeline-strategy-options]]
== Pipeline Strategy Options

The following options are specific to the
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#pipeline-build[Pipeline build strategy].

[[jenkinsfile]]
=== Providing the Jenkinsfile

You can provide the Jenkinsfile in one of two ways:

1. Embed the Jenkinsfile in the build configuration.
2. Include in the build configuration a reference to the
   Git repository that contains the Jenkinsfile.

.Embedded Definition
[source,yaml]
----
kind: "BuildConfig"
apiVersion: "v1"
metadata:
  name: "sample-pipeline"
spec:
  strategy:
    jenkinsPipelineStrategy:
      jenkinsfile: "node('agent') {\nstage 'build'\nopenshiftBuild(buildConfig: 'ruby-sample-build', showBuildLogs: 'true')\nstage 'deploy'\nopenshiftDeploy(deploymentConfig: 'frontend')\n}"
----

.Reference to Git Repository
[source,yaml]
----
kind: "BuildConfig"
apiVersion: "v1"
metadata:
  name: "sample-pipeline"
spec:
  source:
    git:
      uri: "https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world"
  strategy:
    jenkinsPipelineStrategy:
      jenkinsfilePath: some/repo/dir/filename <1>
----
<1> The optional `jenkinsfilePath` field specifies the name of the
    file to use, relative to the source `contextDir`.
    If `contextDir` is omitted, it defaults to the root of the repository.
    If `jenkinsfilePath` is omitted, it defaults to *_Jenkinsfile_*.
