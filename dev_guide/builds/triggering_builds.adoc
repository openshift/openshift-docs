== Build Triggers Overview

When defining a `BuildConfig`, you can define triggers to control the
circumstances in which the `BuildConfig` should be run. The following build
triggers are available:

* xref:webhook-triggers[Webhook]
* xref:image-change-triggers[Image change]
* xref:config-change-triggers[Configuration change]

[[webhook-triggers]]
== Webhook Triggers

Webhook triggers allow you to trigger a new build by sending a request to the
{product-title} API endpoint. You can define these triggers using
link:https://developer.github.com/webhooks/[GitHub],
link:https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html[GitLab],
link:https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/manage-webhooks-735643732.html[Bitbucket],
or Generic webhooks.

Currently, {product-title} webhooks support only the analogous versions of the
push event for each of the Git-based source code management systems (SCMs). All
other event types are ignored.

When the push events are processed, the {product-title} master host confirms if
the branch reference inside the event matches the branch reference in the
corresponding `BuildConfig`. If so, it then checks out the exact commit
reference noted in the webhook event on the {product-title} build. If they do
not match, no build is triggered.

[NOTE]
====
`oc new-app` and `oc new-build` will create GitHub and Generic webhook triggers automatically, but any other needed webhook triggers must be added manually (see xref:setting-triggers[Setting Triggers]).
====

For all webhooks, you must define a `Secret` with a key named `WebHookSecretKey` and the
value being the value to be supplied when invoking the webhook.  The webhook definition
must then reference the secret.  The secret ensures the uniqueness of the URL, preventing
others from triggering the build.  The value of the key will be compared to the secret provided 
during the webhook invocation.

For example here is a GitHub webhook with a reference
to a secret named `mysecret`:

[source,yaml]
----
type: "GitHub"
github:
  secretReference: 
    name: "mysecret"
----

The secret is then defined as follows.  Note that the value of the secret is base64 encoded as
is required for any `data` field of a `Secret` object.

[source,yaml]
----
- kind: Secret
  apiVersion: v1
  metadata:
    name: mysecret
    creationTimestamp: 
  data:
    WebHookSecretKey: c2VjcmV0dmFsdWUx
----


[[github-webhooks]]
=== GitHub Webhooks

link:https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/[GitHub webhooks] handle the call
made by GitHub when a repository is updated. When defining the trigger, you must
specify a `secret`, which will be part of the URL you supply to GitHub when
configuring the webhook.

Example GitHub webhook definition:

[source,yaml]
----
type: "GitHub"
github:
  secretReference: 
    name: "mysecret"
----

[NOTE]
====
The secret used in the webhook trigger configuration is not the same as `secret`
field you encounter when configuring webhook in GitHub UI. The former is to make
the webhook URL unique and hard to predict, the latter is an optional string field
used to create HMAC hex digest of the body, which is sent as an `X-Hub-Signature`
link:https://developer.github.com/webhooks/#delivery-headers[header].
====

The payload URL is returned as the GitHub Webhook URL by the `oc describe` command
(see xref:describe-buildconfig[Displaying Webhook URLs]), and is structured as follows:

----
http://<openshift_api_host:port>/oapi/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/github
----

To configure a GitHub Webhook:

. Describe the build configuration to get the webhook URL:
+
----
$ oc describe bc <name>
----
. Copy the webhook URL, replacing `<secret>` with your secret value.
. Follow the link:https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/#setting-up-a-webhook[GitHub setup instructions]
to paste the webhook URL into your GitHub repository settings.

[NOTE]
====
link:https://gogs.io[Gogs] supports the same webhook payload format as GitHub.
Therefore, if you are using a Gogs server, you can define a GitHub webhook
trigger on your `BuildConfig` and trigger it via your Gogs server also.
====

Given a file containing a valid JSON payload, such as `payload.json`, you can manually trigger the
webhook via `curl`:

----
$ curl -H "X-GitHub-Event: push" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -k -X POST --data-binary @payload.json https://<openshift_api_host:port>/oapi/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/github
----

The `-k` argument is only necessary if your API server does not have a properly
signed certificate.

[[gitlab-webhooks]]
=== GitLab Webhooks

link:https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html[GitLab webhooks]
handle the call made by GitLab when a repository is updated. As with the GitHub
triggers, you must specify a `secret`. The following example is
a trigger definition YAML within the `BuildConfig`:

[source,yaml]
----
type: "GitLab"
gitlab:
  secretReference: 
    name: "mysecret"
----

The payload URL is returned as the GitLab Webhook URL by the `oc describe` command
(see xref:describe-buildconfig[Displaying Webhook URLs]), and is structured as follows:

----
http://<openshift_api_host:port>/oapi/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/gitlab
----

To configure a GitLab Webhook:

. Describe the build configuration to get the webhook URL:
+
----
$ oc describe bc <name>
----
. Copy the webhook URL, replacing `<secret>` with your secret value.
. Follow the link:https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html#webhooks[GitLab setup instructions]
to paste the webhook URL into your GitLab repository settings.

Given a file containing a valid JSON payload, such as `payload.json`, you can manually trigger the
webhook via `curl`:

----
$ curl -H "X-GitLab-Event: Push Hook" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -k -X POST --data-binary @payload.json https://<openshift_api_host:port>/oapi/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/gitlab
----

The `-k` argument is only necessary if your API server does not have a properly
signed certificate.

[[bitbucket-webhooks]]
=== Bitbucket Webhooks

link:https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/manage-webhooks-735643732.html[Bitbucket webhooks]
handle the call made by Bitbucket when a repository is updated. Similar to the
previous triggers, you must specify a `secret`. The following example is a
trigger definition YAML within the `BuildConfig`:

[source,yaml]
----
type: "Bitbucket"
bitbucket:
  secretReference: 
    name: "mysecret"
----

The payload URL is returned as the Bitbucket Webhook URL by the `oc describe` command
(see xref:describe-buildconfig[Displaying Webhook URLs]), and is structured as follows:

----
http://<openshift_api_host:port>/oapi/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/bitbucket
----

To configure a Bitbucket Webhook:

. Describe the build configuration to get the webhook URL:
+
----
$ oc describe bc <name>
----

. Copy the webhook URL, replacing `<secret>` with your secret value.
. Follow the link:https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/manage-webhooks-735643732.html[Bitbucket setup instructions]
to paste the webhook URL into your Bitbucket repository settings.

Given a file containing a valid JSON payload, such as `payload.json`, you can manually trigger the
webhook via `curl`:

----
$ curl -H "X-Event-Key: repo:push" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -k -X POST --data-binary @payload.json https://<openshift_api_host:port>/oapi/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/bitbucket
----

The `-k` argument is only necessary if your API server does not have a properly
signed certificate.

[[generic-webhooks]]
=== Generic Webhooks

Generic webhooks are invoked from any system capable of making a web request.
As with the other webhooks, you must specify a secret, which will be part of
the URL that the caller must use to trigger the build. The secret ensures the
uniqueness of the URL, preventing others from triggering the build. The
following is an example trigger definition YAML within the `BuildConfig`:

[source,yaml]
----
type: "Generic"
generic:
  secretReference: 
    name: "mysecret"
  allowEnv: true <1>
----
<1> Set to `true` to allow a generic webhook to pass in environment variables.

To set up the caller, supply the calling system with the URL of the generic
webhook endpoint for your build:

----
http://<openshift_api_host:port>/oapi/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/generic
----

The caller must invoke the webhook as a `POST` operation.

To invoke the webhook manually you can use `curl`:

----
$ curl -X POST -k https://<openshift_api_host:port>/oapi/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/generic
----

The HTTP verb must be set to `POST`. The insecure `-k` flag is specified to
ignore certificate validation. This second flag is not necessary if your cluster
has properly signed certificates.

The endpoint can accept an optional payload with the following format:

[source,yaml]
----
git:
  uri: "<url to git repository>"
  ref: "<optional git reference>"
  commit: "<commit hash identifying a specific git commit>"
  author:
    name: "<author name>"
    email: "<author e-mail>"
  committer:
    name: "<committer name>"
    email: "<committer e-mail>"
  message: "<commit message>"
env: <1>
   - name: "<variable name>"
     value: "<variable value>"
----
<1> Similar to the xref:build_strategies.adoc#buildconfig-environment[`BuildConfig`
environment] variables, the environment variables defined here are made
available to your build. If these variables collide with the `BuildConfig`
environment variables, these variables take precedence. By default, environment
variables passed via webhook are ignored. Set the `allowEnv` field to `true` on
the webhook definition to enable this behavior.

To pass this payload using `curl`, define it in a file named
*_payload_file.yaml_* and run:

----
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/yaml" --data-binary @payload_file.yaml -X POST -k https://<openshift_api_host:port>/oapi/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/generic
----

The arguments are the same as the previous example with the addition of a header
and a payload. The `-H` argument sets the `Content-Type` header to
`application/yaml` or `application/json` depending on your payload format.
The `--data-binary` argument is used to send a binary payload with newlines
intact with the `POST` request.

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} permits builds to be triggered via the generic webhook even if
an invalid request payload is presented (for example, invalid content type,
unparsable or invalid content, and so on). This behavior is maintained for
backwards compatibility. If an invalid request payload is presented,
{product-title} returns a warning in JSON format as part of its `HTTP 200 OK`
response.
====

[[describe-buildconfig]]
=== Displaying Webhook URLs

Use the following command to display any webhook URLs associated with a build
configuration:

----
$ oc describe bc <name>
----

If the above command does not display any webhook URLs, then no webhook trigger
is defined for that build configuration. See xref:setting-triggers[Setting Triggers]
to manually add triggers.

[[image-change-triggers]]
== Image Change Triggers

Image change triggers allow your build to be automatically invoked when a new
version of an upstream image is available. For example, if a build is based on
top of a RHEL image, then you can trigger that build to run any time the RHEL
image changes. As a result, the application image is always running on the
latest RHEL base image.

Configuring an image change trigger requires the following actions:

. Define an `ImageStream` that points to the upstream image you want to
trigger on:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: "ImageStream"
apiVersion: "v1"
metadata:
  name: "ruby-20-centos7"
----
+
This defines the image stream that is tied to a container image repository
located at *_<system-registry>_/_<namespace>_/ruby-20-centos7*. The
*_<system-registry>_* is defined as a service with the name `docker-registry`
running in {product-title}.

. If an image stream is the base image for the build, set the from field in the
build strategy to point to the image stream:
+
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "ruby-20-centos7:latest"
----
+
In this case, the `sourceStrategy` definition is consuming the `latest` tag of
the image stream named `ruby-20-centos7` located within this namespace.

. Define a build with one or more triggers that point to image streams:
+
[source,yaml]
----
type: "imageChange" <1>
imageChange: {}
type: "imagechange" <2>
imageChange:
  from:
    kind: "ImageStreamTag"
    name: "custom-image:latest"
----
<1> An image change trigger that monitors the `ImageStream` and `Tag` as
defined by the build strategy's `from` field. The `imageChange` object here
must be empty.
<2> An image change trigger that monitors an arbitrary image stream. The
`imageChange` part in this case must include a `from` field that references
the `ImageStreamTag` to monitor.

When using an image change trigger for the strategy image stream, the generated
build is supplied with an immutable Docker tag that points to the latest image
corresponding to that tag. This new image reference will be used by the strategy
when it executes for the build.

For other image change triggers that do not reference the strategy image stream,
a new build will be started, but the build strategy will not be updated with a
unique image reference.

In the example above that has an image change trigger for the strategy, the
resulting build will be:

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "DockerImage"
      name: "172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos7:<immutableid>"
----

This ensures that the triggered build uses the new image that was just pushed to
the repository, and the build can be re-run any time with the same inputs.

ifndef::openshift-online[]
In addition to setting the image field for all `Strategy` types, for custom
builds, the `OPENSHIFT_CUSTOM_BUILD_BASE_IMAGE` environment variable is checked.
If it does not exist, then it is created with the immutable image reference. If
it does exist then it is updated with the immutable image reference.
endif::[]

If a build is triggered due to a webhook trigger or manual request,
the build that is created uses the `<immutableid>` resolved from the
`ImageStream` referenced by the `Strategy`. This ensures that builds
are performed using consistent image tags for ease of reproduction.

[NOTE]
====
Image streams that point to container images in
link:http://docs.docker.com/v1.7/reference/api/hub_registry_spec/#docker-registry-1-0[v1
Docker registries] only trigger a build once when the
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-stream-tag[image
stream tag] becomes available and not on subsequent image updates. This is due
to the lack of uniquely identifiable images in v1 Docker registries.
====

[[config-change-triggers]]
== Configuration Change Triggers

A configuration change trigger allows a build to be automatically invoked as
soon as a new `BuildConfig` is created. The following is an example trigger
definition YAML within the `BuildConfig`:

[source,yaml]
----
  type: "ConfigChange"
----

[NOTE]
====
Configuration change triggers currently only work when creating a new
`BuildConfig`. In a future release, configuration change triggers will also be
able to launch a build whenever a `BuildConfig` is updated.
====

[[setting-triggers]]
=== Setting Triggers Manually

Triggers can be added to and removed from build configurations with `oc set
triggers`. For example, to set a GitHub webhook trigger on a build
configuration, use:

----
$ oc set triggers bc <name> --from-github
----

To set an imagechange trigger, use

----
$ oc set triggers bc <name> --from-image='<image>'
----

To remove a trigger, add `--remove`:

----
$ oc set triggers bc <name> --from-bitbucket --remove
----

[NOTE]
====
When a webhook trigger already exists, adding it again regenerates the
webhook secret.
====

For more information, consult the help documentation with `oc set triggers
--help`
