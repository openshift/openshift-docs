[[dev-guide-what-is-a-build]]
== What Is a Build?

A
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/build.adoc#builds[_build_]
in {product-title} is the process of transforming input parameters into a
resulting object. Most often, builds are used to transform source code into a
runnable container image.

A _build configuration_, or `BuildConfig`, is characterized by a _build strategy_ and one
or more sources. The strategy determines the aforementioned process, while the
sources provide its input.

The
ifdef::openshift-online[]
supported
endif::[]
build strategies are:

- Source-to-Image (S2I)
(xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/build.adoc#source-build[description],
xref:build_strategies.adoc#source-to-image-strategy-options[options])
- Pipeline
(xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/build.adoc#pipeline-build[description],
xref:build_strategies.adoc#pipeline-strategy-options[options])
ifndef::openshift-online[]
- Docker
(xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/build.adoc#docker-build[description],
xref:build_strategies.adoc#docker-strategy-options[options])
- Custom
(xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/build.adoc#custom-build[description],
xref:build_strategies.adoc#custom-strategy-options[options])
endif::[]

And there are six types of sources that can be given as
xref:build_inputs.adoc#dev-guide-build-inputs[_build input_]:

- xref:build_inputs.adoc#source-code[Git]
ifndef::openshift-online[]
- xref:build_inputs.adoc#dockerfile-source[Dockerfile]
endif::[]
- xref:build_inputs.adoc#binary-source[Binary]
- xref:build_inputs.adoc#image-source[Image]
- xref:build_inputs.adoc#using-secrets-during-build[Input secrets]
- xref:build_inputs.adoc#using-external-artifacts[External artifacts]

It is up to each build strategy to consider or ignore a certain type of source,
as well as to determine how it is to be used. Binary and Git are mutually
exclusive source types.
ifdef::openshift-online[]
Image can be used by itself or together with either Git or Binary.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated,openshift-enterprise[]
Dockerfile and Image can be used by themselves, with each other, or together
with either Git or Binary.
endif::[]
The Binary source type is
unique from the other options in xref:build_inputs.adoc#binary-source[how it is
specified to the system].

[[defining-a-buildconfig]]
== What Is a BuildConfig?

A build configuration describes a single build definition and a set of
xref:triggering_builds.adoc#build-triggers[triggers] for when a new build should
be created. Build configurations are defined by a `BuildConfig`, which is a REST
object that can be used in a POST to the API server to create a new instance.

Depending on how you choose to create your application using {product-title}, a
`BuildConfig` is typically generated automatically for you if you use the web
console or CLI, and it can be edited at any time. Understanding the parts that
make up a `BuildConfig` and their available options can help if you choose to
manually tweak your configuration later.

The following example `BuildConfig` results in a new build every time a
container image tag or the source code changes:

.BuildConfig Object Definition
[source,yaml]
----
kind: "BuildConfig"
apiVersion: "v1"
metadata:
  name: "ruby-sample-build" <1>
spec:
  runPolicy: "Serial" <2>
  triggers: <3>
    -
      type: "GitHub"
      github:
        secret: "secret101"
    - type: "Generic"
      generic:
        secret: "secret101"
    -
      type: "ImageChange"
  source: <4>
    git:
      uri: "https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world"
  strategy: <5>
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: "ImageStreamTag"
        name: "ruby-20-centos7:latest"
  output: <6>
    to:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "origin-ruby-sample:latest"
  postCommit: <7>
      script: "bundle exec rake test"
----
<1> This specification will create a new `BuildConfig` named
*ruby-sample-build*.
<2> The `runPolicy` field controls whether builds created from this build
configuration can be run simultaneously. The default value is `Serial`, which means new builds
will run sequentially, not simultaneously.
<3> You can specify a list of xref:triggering_builds.adoc#build-triggers[triggers],
which cause a new build to be created.
<4> The `source` section defines the source of the build. The source type
determines the primary source of input, and can be either `Git`, to point to
a code repository location,
ifndef::openshift-online[]
`Dockerfile`, to build from an inline Dockerfile,
endif::[]
or `Binary`, to accept binary payloads. It is possible to have multiple
sources at once, refer to the documentation for each source type for details.
<5> The `strategy` section describes the build strategy used to execute the
build. You can specify a `Source`
ifndef::openshift-online[]
, `Docker`, or `Custom`
endif::[]
strategy here. This above example uses the `ruby-20-centos7` container image
that Source-To-Image will use for the application build.
<6> After the container image is successfully built, it will be pushed into the
repository described in the `output` section.
<7> The `postCommit` section defines an optional xref:build_hooks.adoc#build-hooks[build hook].
