[[dev-guide-build-environment-overview]]
== Overview

As with pod environment variables, build environment variables can be defined in
terms of references to other resources/variables using the xref:../../dev_guide/downward_api.adoc#dev-guide-downward-api[Downward API].
However, there are some exceptions as noted below.

[NOTE]
====
You can also manage environment variables defined in the `BuildConfig` with the
xref:../../dev_guide/environment_variables.adoc#dev-guide-environment-variables[`oc set env`] command.

[[using-build-fields-as-environment-variables]]
== Using Build Fields as Environment Variables

You can inject information about the build object by setting the `fieldPath`
environment variable source to the `JsonPath` of the field from which you are
interested in obtaining the value.

[source,yaml]
----
env:
  - name: FIELDREF_ENV
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        fieldPath: metadata.name
----

[NOTE]
====
Jenkins Pipeline strategy does not support `valueFrom` syntax for environment
variables.
====

[[using-container-resources-as-environment-variables]]
== Using Container Resources as Environment Variables

Referencing container resources using `valueFrom` in build environment variables
is not supported as the references are resolved before the container is created.
