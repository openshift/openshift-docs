[[build-output]]
== Build Output Overview

Builds that use the
ifndef::openshift-online[]
`Docker` or
endif::[]
`Source` strategy result in the creation of a
new container image. The image is then pushed to the container image registry
specified in the `output` section of the `Build` specification.

If the output kind is `ImageStreamTag`, then the image will be pushed to the
integrated {product-title} registry and tagged in the specified image stream. If
the output is of type `DockerImage`, then the name of the output reference
will be used as a Docker push specification. The specification may contain a
registry or will default to DockerHub if no registry is specified. If the output
section of the build specification is empty, then the image will not be pushed
at the end of the build.

[[output-image-environment-variables]]
== Output Image Environment Variables

ifndef::openshift-online[]
`Docker` and
endif::[]
`Source` strategy builds set the following environment variables on output
images:

[options="header"]
|===

|Variable |Description

|`*OPENSHIFT_BUILD_NAME*`
|Name of the build

|`*OPENSHIFT_BUILD_NAMESPACE*`
|Namespace of the build

|`*OPENSHIFT_BUILD_SOURCE*`
|The source URL of the build

|`*OPENSHIFT_BUILD_REFERENCE*`
|The Git reference used in the build

|`*OPENSHIFT_BUILD_COMMIT*`
|Source commit used in the build
|===

Additionally, any user-defined environment variable, for example those
configured via
xref:build_strategies.adoc#configuring-the-source-environment[`Source`]
ifndef::openshift-online[]
or xref:build_strategies.adoc#docker-strategy-environment[`Docker`]
endif::[]
strategy options, will also be part of the output image environment variable
list.

[[output-image-labels]]
== Output Image Labels

ifndef::openshift-online[]
`Docker` and
endif::[]
`Source` builds set the following labels on output images:

[options="header"]
|===

|Label |Description

|*io.openshift.build.commit.author*
|Author of the source commit used in the build

|*io.openshift.build.commit.date*
|Date of the source commit used in the build

|*io.openshift.build.commit.id*
|Hash of the source commit used in the build

|*io.openshift.build.commit.message*
|Message of the source commit used in the build

|*io.openshift.build.commit.ref*
|Branch or reference specified in the source

|*io.openshift.build.source-location*
|Source URL for the build
|===

You can also use the `BuildConfig.spec.output.imageLabels` field to specify a
list of custom labels that will be applied to each image built from the BuildConfig.

== Using Docker Credentials for Private Registries

To push an image to a private Docker registry, credentials can be supplied using
a secret. See
xref:build_inputs.adoc#using-docker-credentials-for-private-registries[Build Inputs] for instructions.
