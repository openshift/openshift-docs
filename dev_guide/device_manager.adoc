== Enabling Device Manager

Enable Device Manager to implement a device plug-in to advertise specialized
hardware without any upstream code changes.

. Enable Device Manager support on the target node or nodes:
+
----
# cat /etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml
...
kubeletArguments:
...
  feature-gates:
  - DevicePlugins=true

# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
----

. Ensure that Device Manager was actually enabled by confirming that
*_/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins/kubelet.sock_* is created on the node. This is
the UNIX domain socket on which the Device Manager gRPC server listens for new
plug-in registrations. This sock file is created when the Kubelet is started
only if Device Manager is enabled.
