{product-title} provides multiple methods for communicating from outside the
cluster with services running in the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
The procedures in this section require prerequisites performed by the cluster
administrator.
====

Administrators can expose a service endpoint that external traffic can reach, by
assigning a unique external IP address to that service from a range of external
IP addresses. Administrators can designate a range of addresses using a CIDR
notation, which allows an application user to make a request against the cluster
for an external IP address.

Each IP address should be assigned to only one service to ensure that each
service has a unique endpoint. Potential port clashes are handled on a
first-come, first-served basis.

The recommendation, in order or preference, is:

* If you have HTTP/HTTPS, use a
 xref:../../dev_guide/expose_service/expose_internal_ip_router.adoc#getting-traffic-into-cluster-router[router].
* If you have a TLS-encrypted protocol other than HTTPS (for example, TLS with
 the SNI header), use a
 xref:../../dev_guide/expose_service/expose_internal_ip_router.adoc#getting-traffic-into-cluster-router[router].
* Otherwise, use a
 xref:../../dev_guide/expose_service/expose_internal_ip_load_balancer.adoc#getting-traffic-into-cluster-load[Load
 Balancer], an
 xref:../../dev_guide/expose_service/expose_internal_ip_service.adoc#getting-traffic-into-cluster-ip[External
 IP], or a
 xref:../../dev_guide/expose_service/expose_internal_ip_nodeport.adoc#getting-traffic-into-cluster-nodeport[NodePort].

|Method |Purpose

|xref:../../dev_guide/expose_service/expose_internal_ip_router.adoc#getting-traffic-into-cluster-router[Use a router]
|Allows access to HTTP/HTTPS traffic and TLS-encrypted protocols other than HTTPS (for example, TLS with the SNI header).

|xref:../../dev_guide/expose_service/expose_internal_ip_load_balancer.adoc#getting-traffic-into-cluster-load[Automatically Assign a Public IP Using a Load Balancer Service]
|Allows traffic to non-standard ports through an IP address assigned from a pool.

|xref:../../dev_guide/expose_service/expose_internal_ip_service.adoc#getting-traffic-into-cluster-ip[Manually assign an external IP to a service]
|Allows traffic to non-standard ports through a specific IP address.

|xref:../../dev_guide/expose_service/expose_internal_ip_nodeport.adoc#getting-traffic-into-cluster-nodeport[Configure a NodePort]
|Expose a service on all nodes in the cluster.
