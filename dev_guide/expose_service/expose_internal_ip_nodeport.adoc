== Overview
//from getting_traffic_into_cluster.html

Use NodePorts xref:index.adoc#getting-traffic-into-cluster-index[to expose the service] nodePort on all nodes in the cluster.

[[NOTE]]
====
Using NodePorts requires additional port resources.
====

A node port exposes the service on a static port on the node IP address.

NodePorts are in the 30000-32767 range by default, which means a NodePort is
unlikely to match a service's intended port (for example, 8080 may be exposed
as 31020).

The administrator must ensure the external IPs are routed to the nodes and local
firewall rules on all nodes allow access to the open port.

NodePorts and external IPs are independent and both can be used concurrently.

== Configuring the Service

You specify a port number for the nodePort when you create or modify a service. If you didn't manually specify a port, system will allocate one for you.

. Log into the master node.

. If the project you want to use does not exist, create a new project for your service:
+
----
$ oc new-project <project_name>
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ oc new-project external-ip
----

. Edit the service definition to specify `spec.type:NodePort` and optionally specify a port in the in the 30000-32767 range.

metadata:
  name: mysql
  labels:
    name: mysql
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - port: 3036
      nodePort: 30036
      name: http
  selector:
    name: mysql
----

. Execute the following command to xref:../../dev_guide/application_lifecycle/new_app.adoc#dev-guide-new-app[create the service]:
+
----
$ oc new-app <file-name>
----
+
For example:
+
----
oc new-app mysql.yaml
----

. Execute the following command to see that the new service is created:
+
----
oc get svc

NAME             CLUSTER_IP       EXTERNAL_IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
mysql            172.30.89.219    <nodes>       3036:30036/TCP               2m
----
+
Note that the external IP is listed as `<nodes>` and the node ports are listed.

You should be able to access the service using the `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>` address.
