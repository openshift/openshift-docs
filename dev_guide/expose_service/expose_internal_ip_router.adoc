== Overview

Using a router is the most common way xref:index.adoc#getting-traffic-into-cluster-index[to allow external access to an {product-title} cluster].

A xref:../../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-routes[router] is configured to accept external requests and proxy them based on the configured xref:../../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-routes[routes]. This is limited to HTTP/HTTPS(SNI)/TLS(SNI), which covers web applications.

== Configure the Router
//from getting_traffic_into_cluster.html

Work with your administrator to configure a router
to accept external requests and proxy them based on the
configured routes.

The administrator can create a
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
xref:../../install/prerequisites.adoc#prereq-dns[wildcard DNS]
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-online[]
wildcard DNS
endif::[]
entry and then set up a router.  Then, you can self-service the edge
router without having to contact the administrators.

The router has controls to
allow the administrator to specify whether the users can self-provision host
names or the host names require a specific pattern.

When a set of routes is created in various projects, the overall set of routes is available to the set of routers. Each router admits (or selects) routes from the set of routes. By default, all routers admit all routes.

Routers that have permission to view all of the xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[labels] in all projects can select routes to admit based on the labels. This is called xref:../../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#router-sharding[router sharding]. This is useful when balancing incoming traffic load among a set of routers and when isolating traffic to a specific router. For example, company A goes to one router and company B to another.

Since a router runs on a specific node, when it or the node fails traffic ingress stops. The impact of this can be reduced by creating redundant routers
on different nodes and using xref:../../admin_guide/high_availability.adoc#admin-guide-high-availability[high availability] to switch the router IP address when a node fails.

ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
Users can create a wildcard DNS CNAME to use custom domain names in their routes.

----
*.example.com.    CNAME    <placeholder>.<shard>.<cluster-id>.openshiftapps.com.
----

[NOTE]
====
Make sure to direct the wildcard at a placeholder subdomain value.
