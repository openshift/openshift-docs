== Overview

If you do not need a specific external IP address, you can configure a load balancer service to allow external access to an {product-title} cluster.

A load balancer service allocates a unique IP from a configured pool. The load balancer a single edge router IP (which can be a xref:expose-lb-fail[virtual IP (VIP)], but is still a single machine for initial load balancing).

This process involves the following:

* xref:expose-lb-pre[The administrator performs the prerequisites];

* xref:expose-lb-project[The developer creates a project and service], if the service to be exposed does not exist;

* xref:expose-lb-svc[The developer exposes the service to create a route].

* xref:automatically-assign-create-lb[The developer creates the Load Balancer Service].

* xref:load-balancer-ips-network[The network administrator configures networking to the service].

== Create the Load Balancer Service

To create a load balancer service:

. Log into {product-title}.

. Load the project where the service you want to expose is located. If the project or service does not exist, see xref:expose-lb-project[Create a Project and Service].
+
----
$ oc project project1
----

. Open a text file on the master node and paste the following text, editing the file as needed:
+
.Sample load balancer configuration file
====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: egress-2 <1>
spec:
  ports:
  - name: db
    port: 3306 <2>
  loadBalancerIP:
  type: LoadBalancer <3>
  selector:
    name: mysql <4>
----

<1> Enter a descriptive name for the load balancer service.
<2> Enter the same port that the service you want to expose is listening on.
<3> Enter `loadbalancer` as the type.
<4> Enter the name of the service.
====

. Save and exit the file.

. Run the following command to create the service:
+
----
oc create -f <file-name>
----
+
For example:
+
----
oc create -f mysql-lb.yaml
----

. Execute the following command to view the new service:
+
----
oc get svc
NAME              CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP                   PORT(S)                   AGE
egress-2          172.30.236.167   172.29.121.74,172.29.121.74   3306/TCP                  6s
----
+
Note that the service has an external IP address automatically assigned. 

. On the master, use a tool, such as cURL, to make sure you can reach the service using the public IP address:
+
----
$ curl <public-ip>:<port>
----
++
For example:
+
----
$ curl 172.29.121.74:3306
----
+
The examples in this section use a MySQL service, which requires a client application. If you get a string of characters with the `Got packets out of order` message,
you are connecting with the service:
+
If you have a MySQL client, log in with the standard CLI command:
+
----
$ mysql -h 172.30.131.89 -u admin -p
Enter password:
Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.

MySQL [(none)]>

== Configuring Networking

The following steps are general guidelines for configuring the networking required to access the exposed service from other nodes. As network environments vary, consult your network administrator for specific configurations
that need to be made within your environment.

These steps assume that all of the systems are on the same subnet.

*On the Node:*

. Restart the network to make sure the network is up.
+
----
$ service network restart
Restarting network (via systemctl):  [  OK  ]
----
+
If the network is not up, you will receive error messages such as *Network is unreachable* when executing the following commands.

. Add a route between the IP address of the exposed service on the master and the IP address of the master host. If using a netmask for a networking route, use the `netmask` option, as well as the netmask to use:
+
----
$ route add -net 172.29.121.74 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw 10.16.41.22 dev eth0
----

. Use a tool, such as cURL, to make sure you can reach the service using the public IP address:
+
----
$ curl <public-ip>:<port>
----
+
For example:
+
----
curl 172.29.121.74:3306
----
+
If you get a string of characters with the `Got packets out of order` message, your service is accessible from the node.

*On the system that is not in the cluster:*

. Restart the network to make sure the network is up.
+
----
$ service network restart
Restarting network (via systemctl):  [  OK  ]
----
+
If the network is not up, you will receive error messages such as *Network is unreachable* when executing the following commands.

. Add a route between the IP address of the exposed service on master and the IP address of the master host. If using a netmask for a networking route, use the `netmask` option, as well as the netmask to use:
+
----
$ route add -net 172.29.121.74 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw 10.16.41.22 dev eth0
----

. Make sure you can reach the service using the public IP address:
+
----
$ curl <public-ip>:<port>
----
+
For example:
+
----
curl 172.29.121.74:3306
----
+
If you get a string of characters with the `Got packets out of order` message, your service is accessible outside the cluster.
