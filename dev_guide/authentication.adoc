[[web-console-authentication]]

== Web Console Authentication
When accessing the
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.html[web console]
from a browser at *<master_public_addr>:8443*, you are automatically redirected
to a login page.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
.Web Console Login Page
image::login_page.png["Web Console Login Page"]
endif::[]

You can provide your login credentials on this page to obtain a token to make
API calls. After logging in, you can navigate your projects using the
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.html[web console].

[[cli-authentication]]

== CLI Authentication
You can authenticate from the command line using the CLI command `oc login`.
You can link:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.html[get started with the CLI] by
running this command without any options:

----
$ oc login
----

The command's interactive flow helps you establish a session to an OpenShift
server with the provided credentials. If any information required to successfully
log in to an OpenShift server is not provided, the command prompts for user
input as required. The
link:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#cli-configuration-files[configuration]
is automatically saved and is then used for every subsequent command.

All configuration options for the `oc login` command, listed in the `oc login
--help` command output, are optional. The following example shows usage with
some common options:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc login [-u=<username>] \
  [-p=<password>] \
  [-s=<server>] \
  [-n=<project>] \
  [--certificate-authority=</path/to/file.crt>|--insecure-skip-tls-verify]
----

The following table describes these common options:

.Common CLI Configuration Options
[cols="1,2,5",options="header"]
|===

|Option |Syntax |Description

.^|`-s, --server`
a|[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc login -s=<server>
|Specifies the host name of the OpenShift server. If a
server is provided through this flag, the command does not ask for it
interactively. This flag can also be used if you already have a CLI
configuration file and want to log in and switch to another server.

.^|`-u, --username` and `-p, --password`
a|----
$ oc login -u=<username> -p=<password>
----
|Allows you to specify the credentials to log in to the OpenShift
server. If user name or password are provided through these flags, the command
does not ask for it interactively. These flags can also be used if you already
have a configuration file with a session token established and want to log in and
switch to another user name.

.^|`-n, --namespace`
a|----
$ oc login -u=<username> -p=<password> -n=<project>
----
|A global CLI option which, when used with `oc login`, allows you to specify the
project to switch to when logging in as a given user.

.^|`--certificate-authority`
a|[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc login --certificate-authority=<path/to/file.crt>
----
|Correctly and securely authenticates with an OpenShift
server that uses HTTPS. The path to a certificate authority file must be
provided.

.^|`--insecure-skip-tls-verify`
a|[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc login --insecure-skip-tls-verify
----
|Allows interaction with an HTTPS server bypassing the server
certificate checks; however, note that it is not secure. If you try to `oc
login` to a HTTPS server that does not provide a valid certificate, and this or
the `--certificate-authority` flags were not provided, `oc login` will prompt
for user input to confirm (`y/N` kind of input) about connecting insecurely.

CLI configuration files allow you to easily
link:../cli_reference/manage_cli_profiles.html[manage multiple CLI profiles].

// tag::systemadminlogin[]

[NOTE]
====
If you have access to administrator credentials but are no longer logged in as
the link:/architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.html#users[default
system user] *system:admin*, you can log back in as this user at any time as
long as the credentials are still present in your
link:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#cli-configuration-files[CLI
configuration file]. The following command logs in and switches to the *default*
project:

----
$ oc login -u system:admin -n default
----
====

// end::systemadminlogin[]
