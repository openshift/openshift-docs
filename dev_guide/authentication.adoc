[[web-console-authentication]]

== Web Console Authentication
When accessing the
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-web-console[web console]
ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated,openshift-aro,openshift-enterprise[]
from a browser at *<master_public_addr>:8443*, you are automatically redirected
endif::[]
ifdef::atomic-registry,openshift-online[]
from a browser, you are automatically redirected
endif::[]
to a login page.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
.Web Console Login Page
image::login_page.png["Web Console Login Page"]
endif::[]

Review the
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#browser-requirements[browser versions
and operating systems] that can be used to access the web console.

You can provide your login credentials on this page to obtain a token to make
API calls. After logging in, you can navigate your projects using the
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-web-console[web console].

[[cli-authentication]]

== CLI Authentication
You can authenticate from the command line using the CLI command `oc login`.
You can xref:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.adoc#cli-reference-get-started-cli[get started with the CLI] by
running this command
ifndef::openshift-online[]
without any options:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-online[]
with the url of the online cluster you are using:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login https://<online_cluster_url>
----
endif::[]

The command's interactive flow helps you establish a session to an {product-title}
server with the provided credentials. If any information required to successfully
log in to an {product-title} server is not provided, the command prompts for user
input as required. The
xref:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.adoc#cli-configuration-files[configuration]
is automatically saved and is then used for every subsequent command.

All configuration options for the `oc login` command, listed in the `oc login
--help` command output, are optional. The following example shows usage with
some common options:

[source,terminal,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc login [-u=<username>] \
  [-p=<password>] \
  [-s=<server>] \
  [-n=<project>] \
  [--certificate-authority=</path/to/file.crt>|--insecure-skip-tls-verify]
----

The following table describes these common options:

.Common CLI Configuration Options
[cols="1,2,5",options="header"]
|===

|Option |Syntax |Description

.^|`-s, --server`
a|[source,terminal,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc login -s=<server>
----
|Specifies the host name of the {product-title} server. If a
server is provided through this flag, the command does not ask for it
interactively. This flag can also be used if you already have a CLI
configuration file and want to log in and switch to another server.

.^|`-u, --username` and `-p, --password`
a|[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login -u=<username> -p=<password>
----
|Allows you to specify the credentials to log in to the {product-title}
server. If user name or password are provided through these flags, the command
does not ask for it interactively. These flags can also be used if you already
have a configuration file with a session token established and want to log in and
switch to another user name.

.^|`-n, --namespace`
a|[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login -u=<username> -p=<password> -n=<project>
----
|A global CLI option which, when used with `oc login`, allows you to specify the
project to switch to when logging in as a given user.

.^|`--certificate-authority`
a|[source,terminal,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc login --certificate-authority=<path/to/file.crt>
----
|Correctly and securely authenticates with an {product-title}
server that uses HTTPS. The path to a certificate authority file must be
provided.

.^|`--insecure-skip-tls-verify`
a|[source,terminal,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc login --insecure-skip-tls-verify
----
|Allows interaction with an HTTPS server bypassing the server
certificate checks; however, note that it is not secure. If you try to `oc
login` to a HTTPS server that does not provide a valid certificate, and this or
the `--certificate-authority` flags were not provided, `oc login` will prompt
for user input to confirm (`y/N` kind of input) about connecting insecurely.

CLI configuration files allow you to easily

[NOTE]
====
If you have access to administrator credentials but are no longer logged in as
the xref:../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#users[default
system user] *system:admin*, you can log back in as this user at any time as
long as the credentials are still present in your
xref:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.adoc#cli-configuration-files[CLI
configuration file]. The following command logs in and switches to the *default*
project:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login -u system:admin -n default
----

endif::[]


// end::systemadminlogin[]
