== Overview

In software systems, components can become unhealthy due to transient issues
(such as temporary connectivity loss), configuration errors, or problems with
external dependencies. {product-title} applications have a number of options to
detect and handle unhealthy containers.

== Container Health Checks Using Probes

A probe is a Kubernetes action that periodically performs diagnostics on a
running container. Currently, two types of probes exist, each serving a
different purpose:

[cols="1,4"]
|===

|Liveness Probe
|A liveness probe checks if the container in which it is configured is still
running. If the liveness probe fails, the kubelet kills the container, which
will be subjected to its restart policy. Set a liveness check by configuring the
`*template.spec.containers.livenessprobe*` stanza of a pod configuration.

|Readiness Probe
|A readiness probe determines if a container is ready to service requests. If
the readiness probe fails a container, the endpoints controller ensures the
container has its IP address removed from the endpoints of all services. A
readiness probe can be used to signal to the endpoints controller that even
though a container is running, it should not receive any traffic from a proxy.
Set a readiness check by configuring the
`*template.spec.containers.readinessprobe*` stanza of a pod configuration.

|===

The exact timing of a probe is controlled by two fields,
both expressed in units of seconds:

|====
| Field | Description

| `*initialDelaySeconds*`
| How long to wait after the container starts to begin the probe.

| `*timeoutSeconds*`
| How long to wait for the probe to finish (default: `1`).
If this time is exceeded, {product-title} considers the probe to have failed.

|====

Both probes can be configured in three ways:

*HTTP Checks*

The kubelet uses a web hook to determine the healthiness of the container. The
check is deemed successful if the HTTP response code is between 200 and 399. The following is
an example of a readiness check using the HTTP checks method:

.Readiness HTTP check
====
----
...
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 15
  timeoutSeconds: 1
...
----
====

A HTTP check is ideal for applications that return HTTP status codes
when completely initialized.

*Container Execution Checks*

The kubelet executes a command inside the container. Exiting the check with
status 0 is considered a success. The following is an example of a liveness
check using the container execution method:

.Liveness Container Execution Check
====
----
...
livenessProbe:
  exec:
    command:
    - cat
    - /tmp/health
  initialDelaySeconds: 15
  timeoutSeconds: 1
...
----
====

*TCP Socket Checks*

The kubelet attempts to open a socket to the container. The container is only
considered healthy if the check can establish a connection. The following is an
example of a liveness check using the TCP socket check method:

.Liveness TCP Socket Check
====
----
...
livenessProbe:
  tcpSocket:
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 15
  timeoutSeconds: 1
...
----
====

A TCP socket check is ideal for applications that do not start listening until
initialization is complete.

documentation].

[[high-level-application-health-checks]]

== High-level Application Health Checks

Holistic notions of application health that cut across multiple components
cannot be handled with container-scoped liveness checks. Having healthy and
responsive system components in a distributed application, but in a system with
overall unhealthy behavior, is possible. Administrators of distributed systems
use health checks to test the behavior of the overall health of a system.

A typical example is a script that performs a test transaction, exercising the
components of the system together and verifying that the high-level system
behavior in the context of the test transaction matches the expected behavior of
a health system.

{product-title} users can specify high-level health checks and control the
health check methodology by specifying a script to run, and the action to be
taken when a health check has a negative result by creating an event.
