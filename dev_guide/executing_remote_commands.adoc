== Overview
You can use the CLI to execute remote commands in a container. This allows you
to run general Linux commands for routine operations in the container.

[IMPORTANT]
====
link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015:1650[For security purposes], the
`oc exec` command does not work when accessing privileged containers except when
the command is executed by a `cluster-admin` user. See the
xref:../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#troubleshooting-and-debugging-cli-operations[CLI
operations topic] for more information.

== Basic Usage
Support for remote container command execution is built into
xref:../cli_reference/index.adoc#cli-reference-index[the CLI]:

----
$ oc exec <pod> [-c <container>] <command> [<arg_1> ... <arg_n>]
----

For example:

====

----
$ oc exec mypod date
Thu Apr  9 02:21:53 UTC 2015
----
====

== Protocol
Clients initiate the execution of a remote command in a container by issuing a
request to the Kubernetes API server:

----
/proxy/minions/<node_name>/exec/<namespace>/<pod>/<container>?command=<command>
----

In the above URL:

- `<node_name>` is the FQDN of the node.
- `<namespace>` is the namespace of the target pod.
- `<pod>` is the name of the target pod.
- `<container>` is the name of the target container.
- `<command>` is the desired command to be executed.

For example:

====
----
/proxy/minions/node123.openshift.com/exec/myns/mypod/mycontainer?command=date
----
====

Additionally, the client can add parameters to the request to indicate if:

- the client should send input to the remote container's command (stdin).
- the client's terminal is a TTY.
- the remote container's command should send output from stdout to the client.
- the remote container's command should send output from stderr to the client.

After sending an `exec` request to the API server, the client upgrades the
connection to one that supports multiplexed streams; the current implementation
uses *SPDY*.

The client creates one stream each for stdin, stdout, and stderr. To distinguish
among the streams, the client sets the `streamType` header on the stream to one
of `stdin`, `stdout`, or `stderr`.

The client closes all streams, the upgraded connection, and the underlying
connection when it is finished with the remote command execution request.
