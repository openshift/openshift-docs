== Overview
A job, in contrast to
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[a
deployment] (or
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#replication-controllers[a
replication controller]), runs any number of pods to completion. A job tracks the
overall progress of a task and updates its status with information about active,
succeeded, and failed pods. Deleting a job will clean up any pods it created.
Jobs are part of the extensions Kubernetes API, which can be managed with `oc` commands like other
xref:../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#object-types[object types].

See the http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/jobs/[Kubernetes documentation] for
more information about jobs.

[[creating-a-job]]

== Creating a Job

A job configuration consists of the following key parts:

- A pod template, which describes the application the pod will create.
- An optional `*parallelism*` parameter, which specifies how many pods running in parallel should execute a job. If not specified, this defaults to
 the value in the `*completions*` parameter.
- An optional `*completions*` parameter, specifying how many successful pod completions are needed to finish a job. If not specified, this value defaults to one.

The following is an example of a `*job*` resource:

====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: pi
spec:
  selector:         <1>
    matchLabels:
      app: pi
  parallelism: 1    <2>
  completions: 1    <3>
  template:         <4>
    metadata:
      name: pi
      labels:
        app: pi
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pi
        image: perl
        command: ["perl",  "-Mbignum=bpi", "-wle", "print bpi(2000)"]
      restartPolicy: Never
----

1. Label selector of the pod to run. It uses the https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/user-guide/labels.md#label-selectors[generalized label selectors].
2. Optional value for how many pods a job should run in parallel, defaults to `*completions*`.
3. Optional value for how many successful pod completions is needed to mark a job completed, defaults to one.
4. Template for the pod the controller creates.

[[scaling-a-job]]

== Scaling a Job

A job can be scaled up or down by using the `oc scale` command with `--replicas`
option, which, in the case of jobs, modifies the `*spec.parallelism*` parameter.
This will result in modifying the number of pods running in parallel, executing
a job.

The following command uses the example job above, and scales it to three:

====
----
$ oc scale job pi --replicas=3
----
====

[NOTE]
Scaling replication controllers also uses the `oc scale` command with the
`--replicas` option, but instead changes the `*replicas*` parameter of a
replication controller configuration.

[[jobs-setting-maximum-duration]]
== Setting Maximum Duration

When defining a `*Job*`, you can define its maximum duration by setting
the `*activeDeadlineSeconds*` field. It is specified in seconds and is not
set by default. When not set, there is no maximum duration enforced.

The maximum duration is counted from the time when a first pod gets scheduled in
the system, and defines how long a job can be active. It tracks overall time of
an execution and is irrelevant to the number of completions (number of pods
needed to execute a task). After reaching the specified timeout, the job is
terminated by {product-title}.

The following example shows the part of a `*Job*` specifying
`*activeDeadlineSeconds*` field for 30 minutes:

====
[source,yaml]
----
  spec:
    activeDeadlineSeconds: 1800
----
