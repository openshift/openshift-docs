== Overview

It is common for containers to consume information about API objects. The
downward API is a mechanism that allows containers to do this without coupling
to {product-title}. Containers can consume information from the downward API
xref:dapi-using-environment-variables[using environment variables] or a
xref:dapi-using-volume-plugin[volume plug-in].

== Selecting Fields

Fields within the pod are selected using the `*FieldRef*` API type. `*FieldRef*`
has two fields:

[options="header"]
|===
|Field |Description

|`*fieldPath*`
|The path of the field to select, relative to the pod.

|`*apiVersion*`
|The API version to interpret the `*fieldPath*` selector within.
|===

Currently, these are the valid selectors in the v1 API:

[options="header"]
|===
|Selector |Description

|`*metadata.name*`
|The pod's name. This is supported in both environment variables and volumes.

|`*metadata.namespace*`
|The pod's namespace.This is supported in both environment variables and volumes.

|`*metadata.labels*`
|The pod's labels. This is only supported in volumes and not in environment variables.

|`*metadata.annotations*`
|The pod's annotations. This is only supported in volumes and not in environment variables.

|`*status.podIP*`
|The pod's IP. This is only supported in environment variables and not volumes.
|===

The `*apiVersion*` field, if not specified, defaults to the API version of the
enclosing pod template.

In the future, more information, such as resource limits for pods and
information about services, will be available using the downward API.

== Using Environment Variables

One mechanism for consuming the downward API is using a container's environment
variables. The `*EnvVar*` type's `*valueFrom*` field (of type `*EnvVarSource*`)
is used to specify that the variable's value should come from a `*FieldRef*`
source instead of the literal value specified by the `*value*` field. In the
future, additional sources may be supported; currently the source's `*fieldRef*`
field is used to select a field from the downward API.

Only constant attributes of the pod can be consumed this way, as environment
variables cannot be updated once a process is started in a way that allows the
process to be notified that the value of a variable has changed. The fields
supported using environment variables are:

- Pod name
- Pod namespace

For example:

. Create a `*_pod.json_*` file:
+
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: dapi-env-test-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: env-test-container
      image: gcr.io/google_containers/busybox
      command: [ "/bin/sh", "-c", "env" ]
      env:
        - name: MY_POD_NAME
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.name
        - name: MY_POD_NAMESPACE
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.namespace
  restartPolicy: Never
----
====

. Create the pod from the `*_pod.json_*` file:
+
====
----
$ oc create -f pod.json
----
====

. Check the container's logs:
+
====
----
$ oc logs -p dapi-env-test-pod
----
====
+
You should see `MY_POD_NAME` and `MY_POD_NAMESPACE` in the logs.

== Using the Volume Plug-in

Another mechanism for consuming the downward API is using a volume plug-in. The
downward API volume plug-in creates a volume with configured fields projected
into files. The `*metadata*` field of the `*VolumeSource*` API object is used to
configure this volume. The plug-in supports the following fields:

- Pod name
- Pod namespace
- Pod annotations
- Pod labels

.Downward API Volume Plug-in Configuration
====
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: podinfo
      metadata: <1>
        items:  <2>
          - name: "labels" <3>
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.labels <4>
----
<1> The `*metadata*` field of the volume source configures the downward API
volume.
<2> The `*items*` field holds a list of fields to project into the volume.
<3> The name of the file to project the field into.
<4> The selector of the field to project.
====

For example:

. Create a `*_volume-pod.json_*` file:
+
====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  labels:
    zone: us-east-coast
    cluster: downward-api-test-cluster1
    rack: rack-123
  name: dapi-volume-test-pod
  annotations:
    annotation1: 345
    annotation2: 456
spec:
  containers:
    - name: volume-test-container
      image: gcr.io/google_containers/busybox
      command: ["sh", "-c", "cat /etc/labels /etc/annotations"]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: podinfo
          mountPath: /etc
          readOnly: false
  volumes:
    - name: podinfo
      metadata:
        items:
          - name: "labels"
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.labels
          - name: "annotations"
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.annotations
  restartPolicy: Never
----
====

. Create the pod from the `*_volume-pod.json_*` file:
+
====
----
$ oc create -f volume-pod.json
----
====

. Check the container's logs and verify the presence of the configured fields:
+
====
----
$ oc logs -p dapi-volume-test-pod
cluster=downward-api-test-cluster1
rack=rack-123
zone=us-east-coast
annotation1=345
annotation2=456
