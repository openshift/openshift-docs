== Overview

You can create a new {product-title} application from source code, images, or
templates by using either the OpenShift CLI or web console.

== Creating an Application Using the CLI

[[specifying-source-code]]

=== Creating an Application From Source Code

The `new-app` command allows you to create applications using source code in a
local or remote Git repository.

To create an application using a Git repository in a local directory:

====
----
$ oc new-app /path/to/source/code
----
====

[NOTE]
====
If using a local Git repository, the repository must have an *origin* remote
that points to a URL accessible by the {product-title} cluster.
====

You can use a subdirectory of your source code repository by specifying a
`--context-dir` flag. To create an application using a remote Git repository and a context subdirectory:

====
----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby.git \
    --context-dir=2.0/test/puma-test-app
----
====

Also, when specifying a remote URL, you can specify a Git branch to use by
appending `#<branch_name>` to the end of the URL:

====
----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git#beta4
----
====

Using `new-app` results in a xref:builds.adoc#defining-a-buildconfig[build
configuration], which creates a new application
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[image]
from your source code. It also constructs a
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configuration] to deploy the new image, and a
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[service] to
provide load-balanced access to the deployment running your image.

{product-title} automatically xref:build-strategy-detection[detects] whether the
`*Docker*` or `*Source*`
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#builds[build
strategy] is being used, and in the case of `*Source*` builds,
xref:language-detection[detects an appropriate language builder image].

[[build-strategy-detection]]

**Build Strategy Detection**

If a *_Dockerfile_* is in the repository when creating a new application,
{product-title} generates a
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#docker-build[`*Docker*`
build strategy]. Otherwise, it generates a
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#source-build[`*Source*`
strategy].

You can specify a strategy by setting the `--strategy` flag to either
`source` or `docker`.

====
----
$ oc new-app /home/user/code/myapp --strategy=docker
----
====

[[language-detection]]

**Language Detection**

If creating a `*Source*` build, `new-app` attempts to determine the language
builder to use by the presence of certain files in the root of the repository:

.Languages Detected by `new-app`
[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===

|Language |Files

a|`ruby`
a|*_Rakefile_*, *_Gemfile_*, *_config.ru_*

a|`jee`
a|*_pom.xml_*

a|`nodejs`
a|*_app.json_*, *_package.json_*

a|`php`
a|*_index.php_*, *_composer.json_*

a|`python`
a|*_requirements.txt_*, *_setup.py_*

a|`perl`
a|*_index.pl_*, *_cpanfile_*
|===

After a language is detected, `new-app` searches the {product-title} server for
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[image
stream] tags that have a `*supports*` annotation matching the detected language,
or an image stream that matches the name of the detected language. If a match is
not found, `new-app` searches the https://registry.hub.docker.com[Docker Hub
registry] for an image that matches the detected language based on name.

You can override the image the builder uses for a particular source
repository by specifying the image (either an image stream or container specification) and the repository, with a `~` as a separator.

For example, to use the *myproject/my-ruby* image stream with the source in a
remote repository:

====
----
$ oc new-app myproject/my-ruby~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git
----
====

To use the *openshift/ruby-20-centos7:latest* container image stream with the source in a local repository:

====
----
$ oc new-app openshift/ruby-20-centos7:latest~/home/user/code/my-ruby-app
----
====

[[specifying-an-image]]

=== Creating an Application From an Image

You can deploy an application from an existing image. Images can come from image
streams in the {product-title} server, images in a specific registry or
https://registry.hub.docker.com[Docker Hub registry], or images in the local
Docker server.

The `new-app` command attempts to determine the type of image specified in the
arguments passed to it. However, you can explicitly tell `new-app` whether the
image is a Docker image (using the `--docker-image` argument) or an image stream
(using the `-i|--image` argument).

[NOTE]
====
If you specify an image from your local Docker repository, you must ensure that
the same image is available to the {product-title} cluster nodes.
====

For example, to create an application from the DockerHub MySQL image:

====
----
$ oc new-app mysql
----
====

To create an application using an image in a private registry, specify the full
Docker image specification:

====
----
$ oc new-app myregistry:5000/example/myimage
----
====

[NOTE]
====
If the registry containing the image is not
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
xref:../install_config/install/docker_registry.adoc#securing-the-registry[secured
with SSL],
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
secured with SSL,
endif::[]
cluster administrators must ensure that the Docker daemon on the {product-title}
node hosts is run with the `--insecure-registry` flag pointing to that registry.
You must also tell `new-app` that the image comes from an insecure registry with
the `--insecure-registry=true` flag.
====

You can create an application from an existing
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[image
stream] and tag (optional) for the image stream:

====
----
$ oc new-app my-stream:v1
----
====

[[specifying-a-template]]

=== Creating an Application From a Template

You can create an application from a previously stored
xref:templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[template] or from a template file, by
specifying the name of the template as an argument. For example, you can store a
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/sample-app[sample
application template] and use it to create an application.

To create an application from a stored template:

====
----
$ oc create -f examples/sample-app/application-template-stibuild.json
$ oc new-app ruby-helloworld-sample
----
====

To directly use a template in your local file system, without first storing it
in {product-title}, use the `-f|--file` argument:

====
----
$ oc new-app -f examples/sample-app/application-template-stibuild.json
----
====

[[template-parameters]]

**Template Parameters**

When creating an application based on a xref:templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[template], use the
`-p|--param` argument to set parameter values defined by the template:

====
----
$ oc new-app ruby-helloworld-sample \
    -p ADMIN_USERNAME=admin,ADMIN_PASSWORD=mypassword
----
====

[[new-app-output]]

=== Further Modifying Application Creation

The `new-app` command generates {product-title} objects that will build, deploy, and
run the application being created. Normally, these objects are created in the
current project using names derived from the input source repositories or the
input images. However, `new-app` allows you to modify this behavior.

The set of objects created by `new-app` depends on the artifacts passed as
input: source repositories, images, or templates.

[[artifacts-created-by-new-app]]

.`new-app` Output Objects
[cols="2,8",options="header"]
|===

|Object |Description

a|`*BuildConfig*`
a|A `*BuildConfig*` is created for each source repository specified in the
command line. The `*BuildConfig*` specifies the strategy to use, the source
location, and the build output location.

a|`*ImageStreams*`
a|For `*BuildConfig*`, two `*ImageStreams*` are usually created: one to
represent the input image (the builder image in the case of `*Source*` builds or
*FROM* image in case of `*Docker*` builds), and another one to represent the
output image. If a container image was specified as input to `new-app`, then an
image stream is created for that image as well.

a|`*DeploymentConfig*`
a|A `*DeploymentConfig*` is created either to deploy the output of a build, or a
specified image. The `new-app` command creates xref:volumes.adoc#dev-guide-volumes[*EmptyDir*
volumes] for all Docker volumes that are specified in containers included in the
resulting `*DeploymentConfig*`.

a|`*Service*`
a|The `new-app` command attempts to detect exposed ports in input images. It
uses the lowest numeric exposed port to generate a service that exposes that
port. In order to expose a different port, after `new-app` has completed, simply
use the `oc expose` command to generate additional services.

a|Other
 |Other objects can be generated when instantiating
xref:specifying-a-template[templates].

|===

[[specifying-environment-variables]]

==== Specifying Environment Variables

When generating applications from a xref:specifying-source-code[source] or an
xref:specifying-an-image[image], you can use the `-e|--env` argument to pass
environment variables to the application container at run time:

====
----
$ oc new-app openshift/postgresql-92-centos7 \
    -e POSTGRESQL_USER=user \
    -e POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=db \
    -e POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=password
----
====

[[specifying-labels]]

==== Specifying Labels

When generating applications from xref:specifying-source-code[source],
xref:specifying-an-image[images], or xref:specifying-a-template[templates], you
can use the `-l|--label` argument to add labels to the created objects. Labels
make it easy to collectively select, configure, and delete objects associated
with the application.

====
----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world -l name=hello-world
----
====

[[output-without-creation]]

==== Viewing the Output Without Creation
To see a dry-run of what `new-app` will create, you can use the `-o|--output`
argument with a `yaml` or `json` value. You can then use the output to preview
the objects that will be created, or redirect it to a file that you can edit.
Once you are satisfied, you can use `oc create` to create the {product-title}
objects.

To output `new-app` artifacts to a file, edit them, then create them:

====
----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world \
    -o yaml > myapp.yaml
$ vi myapp.yaml
$ oc create -f myapp.yaml
----
====

// NB: The following sections are ordered by "tweak support";
// first are those supported by command line options,
// after are those possible only via new-app/edit/create.

[[object-names]]

==== Creating Objects With Different Names
Objects created by `new-app` are normally named after the source repository, or
the image used to generate them. You can set the name of the objects produced by
adding a `--name` flag to the command:

====
----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world --name=myapp
----
====

[[object-project-or-namespace]]

==== Creating Objects in a Different Project

Normally, `new-app` creates objects in the current project. However, you can
create objects in a different project that you have access to using the
`-n|--namespace` argument:

====
----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world -n myproject
----
====


[[advanced-multiple-components-and-grouping]]

==== Creating Multiple Objects

The `new-app` command allows creating multiple applications specifying multiple
parameters to `new-app`. Labels specified in the command line apply to all
objects created by the single command. Environment variables apply to all
components created from source or images.

To create an application from a source repository and a Docker Hub image:
====
----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world mysql
----
====

[NOTE]
====
If a source code repository and a builder image are specified as separate
arguments, `new-app` uses the builder image as the builder for the source code
repository. If this is not the intent, simply specify a specific builder image
for the source using the `~` separator.
====

[[grouping-images-and-source-in-a-single-pod]]

==== Grouping Images and Source in a Single Pod
The `new-app` command allows deploying multiple images together in a single pod.
In order to specify which images to group together, use the `+` separator. The
`--group` command line argument can also be used to specify the images that should
be grouped together. To group the image built from a source repository with
other images, specify its builder image in the group:

====
----
$ oc new-app ruby+mysql
----
====

To deploy an image built from source and an external image together:
====
----
$ oc new-app \
    ruby~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world \
    mysql \
    --group=ruby+mysql
----
====

// NB: See note at the end of "Output Without Creation".
[[useful-edits]]
==== Useful Edits

Following are some specific examples of useful
xref:output-without-creation[edits to make]
in the *_myapp.yaml_* file.

NOTE: These examples presume *_myapp.yaml_* was created as
a result of the `oc new-app ... -o yaml` command.
