== Overview

You can create a new OpenShift application using the
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.html[web console] or
by running the `oc new-app` command link:#using-the-cli[from the CLI]. OpenShift
creates a new application by specifying link:#specifying-source-code[source
code], link:#specifying-an-image[images], or
link:#specifying-a-template[templates]. The `new-app` command looks for images
on the local Docker installation (if available), in a
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.html[Docker
registry], or an OpenShift
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#image-streams[image
stream].

If you specify source code, `new-app` attempts to construct a
link:builds.html#defining-a-buildconfig[build configuration] that builds your
source into a new application
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#image-streams[image].
It also constructs a
link:../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configuration] that deploys that new image, and a
link:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services[service] to
provide load balanced access to the deployment that is running your image.

[NOTE]
====
If you link:#specifying-source-code[specify source code], you may need to
link:builds.html#starting-a-build[run a build] with `oc start-build` after the
application is created.
====

[[using-the-cli]]

== Using the CLI

You can create a new application using the `oc new-app` command from
link:../cli_reference/index.html[the CLI].

[[specifying-source-code]]

=== Specifying Source Code

The `new-app` command allows you to create applications using source code from a
local or remote Git repository. If only a source repository is specified,
`new-app` tries to automatically link:#build-strategy-detection[determine] the
type of
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#builds[build
strategy] to use (`*Docker*` or `*Source*`), and in the case of `*Source*` type
builds, link:#language-detection[an appropriate language builder image].

You can tell `new-app` to use a subdirectory of your source code repository by
specifying a `--context-dir` flag. Also, when specifying a remote URL, you can
specify a Git reference to use by appending `#[reference]` to the end of the
URL.


[NOTE]
====
If using a local Git repository, the repository must have an *origin* remote
that points to a URL accessible by the OpenShift cluster.
====

.To Create an Application Using the Git Repository at the Current Directory:
====
----
$ oc new-app .
----
====

.To Create an Application Using a Remote Git Repository and a Context Subdirectory:
====
----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby.git \
    --context-dir=2.0/test/puma-test-app
----
====

.To Create an Application Using a Remote Git Repository with a Specific Branch Reference:
====
----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git#beta4
----
====

[[build-strategy-detection]]

==== Build Strategy Detection

If `new-app` finds a *_Dockerfile_* in the repository, it generates a
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#docker-build[`*Docker*`
build strategy]. Otherwise, it generates a
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[`*Source*`
strategy]. To use a specific strategy, set the `--strategy` flag to either
`source` or `docker`.

.To Force `new-app` to Use the `*Docker*` Strategy for a Local Source Repository:
====
----
$ oc new-app /home/user/code/myapp --strategy=docker
----
====

[[language-detection]]

==== Language Detection
If creating a `*Source*` build, `new-app` attempts to determine which language
builder to use based on the presence of certain files in the root of the
repository:

.Languages Detected by `new-app`
[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===

|Language |Files

a|`ruby`
a|*_Rakefile_*, *_Gemfile_*, *_config.ru_*

a|`jee`
a|*_pom.xml_*

a|`nodejs`
a|*_app.json_*, *_package.json_*

a|`php`
a|*_index.php_*, *_composer.json_*

a|`python`
a|*_requirements.txt_*, *_setup.py_*

a|`perl`
a|*_index.pl_*, *_cpanfile_*
|===

After a language is detected, `new-app` searches the OpenShift server for
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#image-streams[image
stream] tags that have a `*supports*` annotation matching the detected language,
or an image stream that matches the name of the detected language. If a match is
not found, `new-app` searches the https://registry.hub.docker.com[Docker Hub
registry] for an image that matches the detected language based on name.

To override the image that `new-app` uses as the builder for a particular source
repository, the image (either an image stream or Docker specification) can be
specified along with the repository using a `~` as a separator.

.To Use Image Stream *myproject/my-ruby* to Build the Source at a Remote GitHub Repository:
====
----
$ oc new-app myproject/my-ruby~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git
----
====

.To Use Docker Image *openshift/ruby-20-centos7:latest* to Build Source in a Local Repository:
====
----
$ oc new-app openshift/ruby-20-centos7:latest~/home/user/code/my-ruby-app
----
====

[[specifying-an-image]]

=== Specifying an Image

The `new-app` command generates the necessary artifacts to deploy an existing
image as an application. Images can come from image streams in the OpenShift
server, images in a specific registry or https://registry.hub.docker.com[Docker
Hub], or images in the local Docker server.

The `new-app` command attempts to determine the type of image specified in the
arguments passed to it. However, you can explicitly tell `new-app` whether the
image is a Docker image (using the `--docker-image` argument) or an image stream
(using the `-i|--image` argument).


[NOTE]
====
If you specify an image from your local Docker repository, you must ensure that
the same image is available to the OpenShift cluster nodes.
====

.To Create an Application from the https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/mysql/[DockerHub MySQL Image]:
====
----
$ oc new-app mysql
----
====

To create an application using an image in a private registry, specify the full
Docker image specification.

.To Create an Application from a Local Registry:
====
----
$ oc new-app myregistry:5000/example/myimage
----
====

[NOTE]
====
If the registry that the image comes from is not
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
link:../install_config/install/docker_registry.html#securing-the-registry[secured
with SSL],
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
secured with SSL,
endif::[]
cluster administrators must ensure that the Docker daemon on the
OpenShift nodes is run with the `--insecure-registry` flag pointing to that
registry. You must also tell `new-app` that the image comes from an insecure
registry with the `--insecure-registry=true` flag.
====

To create an application from an existing
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#image-streams[image stream], specify the namespace (optional), name, and tag (optional) for the
image stream.

.To Create an Application from an Existing Image Stream with a Specific Tag:
====
----
$ oc new-app my-stream:v1
----
====

[[specifying-a-template]]

=== Specifying a Template

The `new-app` command can instantiate a link:templates.html[template] from a
previously stored template or from a template file. To instantiate a
previously stored template, specify the name of the template as an argument. For
example, store a
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/sample-app[sample
application template] and use it to create an application.

.To Create an Application from a Previously Stored Template:
====
----
$ oc create -f examples/sample-app/application-template-stibuild.json
$ oc new-app ruby-helloworld-sample
----
====

To use a template in the file system directly, without first storing it in
OpenShift, use the `-f|--file` argument or simply specify the file name as the
argument to `new-app`.

.To Create an Application from a Template in a File:
====
----
$ oc new-app -f examples/sample-app/application-template-stibuild.json
----
====

[[template-parameters]]

==== Template Parameters

When creating an application based on a link:templates.html[template], use the
`-p|--param` argument to set parameter values defined by the template.

.To Specify Template Parameters with a Template:
====
----
$ oc new-app ruby-helloworld-sample \
    -p ADMIN_USERNAME=admin,ADMIN_PASSWORD=mypassword
----
====

[[specifying-environment-variables]]

=== Specifying Environment Variables

When generating applications from link:#specifying-source-code[source] or an
link:#specifying-an-image[image], you can use the `-e|--env` argument to specify
environment to be passed to the application container at run time.

.To Set Environment Variables When Creating an Application for a Database Image:
====
----
$ oc new-app openshift/postgresql-92-centos7 \
    -e POSTGRESQL_USER=user \
    -e POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=db \
    -e POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=password
----
====

[[specifying-labels]]

=== Specifying Labels

When generating applications from link:#specifying-source-code[source],
link:#specifying-an-image[images], or link:#specifying-a-template[templates],
you can use the `l|--label` argument to add labels to objects created by
`new-app`. This is recommended, as labels make it easy to collectively select,
manipulate, and delete objects associated with the application.

.To Use the Label Argument to Label Objects Created by `new-app`:
====
----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world -l name=hello-world
----
====

[[new-app-output]]

=== Command Output

The `new-app` command generates OpenShift objects that will build, deploy, and
run the application being created. Normally, these objects are created in the
current project using names derived from the input source repositories or the
input images. However, `new-app` allows you to modify this behavior.

[[output-without-creation]]

==== Output Without Creation
To see a dry-run of what `new-app` will create, you can use the `-o|--output`
flag with a value of either `yaml` or `json`. You can then use the output to
preview the objects that will be created, or redirect it to a file that you
can edit and then use with `oc create` to create the OpenShift objects.

.To Output `new-app` Artifacts to a File, Edit Them, Then Create Them Using `oc create`:
====
----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world -o json > myapp.json
$ vi myapp.json
$ oc create -f myapp.json
----
====

[[object-names]]

==== Object names
Objects created by `new-app` are normally named after the source repository or
the image used to generate them. You can set the name of the objects produced by
adding a `--name` flag to the command.

.To Create `new-app` Artifacts with a Different Name:
====
----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world --name=myapp
----
====

[[object-project-or-namespace]]

==== Object Project or Namespace
Normally `new-app` creates objects in the current project. However, you can tell
it to create objects in a different project that you have access to using the
`-n|--namespace` argument.

.To Create `new-app` Artifacts in a Different Project:
====
----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world -n myproject
----
====

[[artifacts-created-by-new-app]]

==== Artifacts Created

The set of artifacts created by `new-app` depends on the artifacts passed as
input: source repositories, images, or templates.

.`new-app` Output Objects
[cols="2,8",options="header"]
|===

|Artifact |Description

a|`*BuildConfig*`
a|A `*BuildConfig*` is created for each source repository specified in the
command line. The `*BuildConfig*` specifies the strategy to use, the source
location, and the build output location.

a|`*ImageStreams*`
a|For `*BuildConfig*`, two `*ImageStreams*` are usually created: one to
represent the input image (the builder image in the case of `*Source*` builds or
*FROM* image in case of `*Docker*` builds), and another one to represent the
output image.   If a Docker image was specified as input to `new-app`, then an
image stream is created for that image as well.

a|`*DeploymentConfig*`
a|A `*DeploymentConfig*` is created either to deploy the output of a build, or a
specified image. The `new-app` command creates link:volumes.html[*EmptyDir*
volumes] for all Docker volumes that are specified in containers included in the
resulting `*DeploymentConfig*`.

a|`*Service*`
a|The `new-app` command attempts to detect exposed ports in input images. It
uses the lowest numeric exposed port to generate a service that exposes that
port. In order to expose a different port, after `new-app` has completed, simply
use the `oc expose` command to generate additional services.

a|Other
 |Other objects can be generated when instantiating
link:#specifying-a-template[templates].

|===

[[advanced-multiple-components-and-grouping]]

=== Advanced: Multiple Components and Grouping

The `new-app` command allows creating multiple applications from
link:#specifying-source-code[source], link:#specifying-an-image[images], or
link:#specifying-a-template[templates] at once. To do this, simply specify
multiple parameters to the `new-app` call. Labels specified in the command line
apply to all objects created by the single call. Environment variables apply to
all components created from source or images.

.To Create an Application from a Source Repository and a Docker Hub Image:
====
----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world mysql
----
====

[NOTE]
====
If a source code repository and a builder image are specified as separate
arguments, `new-app` uses the builder image as the builder for the source code
repository. If this is not the intent, simply specify a specific builder image
for the source using the `~` separator.
====

[[grouping-images-and-source-in-a-single-pod]]

==== Grouping Images and Source in a Single Pod
The `new-app` command allows deploying multiple images together in a single pod.
In order to specify which images to group together, use the `+` separator. The
`--group` command line argument can also be used to specify which images should
be grouped together. To group the image built from a source repository with
other images, specify its builder image in the group.

.To Deploy Two Images in a Single Pod:
====
----
$ oc new-app nginx+mysql
----
====

.To Deploy an Image Built from Source and an External Image Together:
====
----
$ oc new-app \
    ruby~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world \
    mysql \
    --group=ruby+mysql
----
====

[[using-the-web-console-na]]

== Using the Web Console

You can also create applications using the
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.html[web console]:

1. While in the desired project, click *Add to Project*:
+
====

image::console_create.png["Web Console Create"]
====

2. Select either a builder image from the list of images in your project, or
from the global library:
+
====

image::console_select_image_or_template.png["Select Builder Image"]
====
+
[NOTE]
====
Only
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#referencing-images-in-image-streams[image
stream tags] which have the *builder* tag listed in their annotations will
appear in this list, as demonstrated here:
====
+
====
----
kind: "ImageStream"
apiVersion: "v1"
metadata:
  name: "ruby"
  creationTimestamp: null
spec:
  dockerImageRepository: "registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ruby-20-rhel7"
  tags:
    -
      name: "2.0"
      annotations:
        description: "Build and run Ruby 2.0 applications"
        iconClass: "icon-ruby"
        tags: "builder,ruby" <1>
        supports: "ruby:2.0,ruby"
        version: "2.0"
----
<1> Including *builder* here ensures this `*ImageStreamTag*` will appear in the
web console as a builder.
====

4. Modify the settings in the new application screen to configure the objects
to support your application:
+
====

image::create_from_image.png["Create from source"]
====
<1> The builder image name and description.
<2> The application name used for the generated OpenShift objects.
<3> The Git repository URL, reference, and context directory for your source code.
<4> Routing configuration section for making this application publicly
accessible.
<5> Deployment configuration section for customizing
link:deployments.html#triggers[deployment triggers] and image environment
variables.
<6> Build configuration section for customizing
link:builds.html#build-triggers[build triggers].
<7> Replica link:deployments.html#scaling[scaling] section for configuring the
number of running instances of the application.
<8> The link:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#labels[labels]
to assign to all items generated for the application. You can add and edit
labels for all objects here.
+
[NOTE]
====
To see all of the configuration options, click the "Show advanced build and deployment options" link.
