== Overview

The `osc new-app` command creates a new OpenShift application by specifying
source code, templates, and images. OpenShift looks for images on the local
Docker installation (if available), a Docker registry, or an OpenShift image
stream.

If you specify a source code URL, the source code is taken and converted into an
link:../architecture/core_objects/openshift_model.html#image[image] that runs inside of a pod. Images are deployed via a link:../architecture/core_objects/openshift_model.html#deploymentconfig[deployment
configuration], and a link:../architecture/core_objects/kubernetes_model.html#service[service] is hooked up to the first public port of the
application.

NOTE: If you specify source code, you may need to
link:builds.html#starting-a-build[run a build] with `osc start-build` after the
application is created.

== Using the CLI

To create an application based on the source code in the current directory:

----
$ osc new-app .
----

To create an application using a public DockerHub image:

----
$ osc new-app <image_name>
----

.Creating an Application From a MySQL Image
====
----
$ osc new-app mysql
----
====

To create an application using a image in a private registry, indicate the filepath:

----
$ osc new-app myregistry.com/mycompany/<image_name>
----

You can also create an application from a remote repository using a label. For example, to create an application from the `ruby-hello-world` remote repository:

====
----
$ osc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world -l name=hello-world
----
====

You can use a previously stored link:templates.html[template] to create an
application. For example, store the
link:../getting_started/dev_get_started/try_it_out.html#sample-application-lifecycle[sample
application template] and use it to create an application:
====
----
$ osc create -f examples/sample-app/application-template-stibuild.json
$ osc new-app ruby-helloworld-sample
----
====

Note that when you create an application based on a stored template, you can use the `-p` or `--param` option to set parameter
values defined by the template:
====
----
$ osc new-app ruby-helloworld-sample -p ADMIN_USERNAME=myuser,ADMIN_PASSWORD=mypass
----
====

== Using the Management Console

You can also create applications with the Management Console:

1. While in the desired project, click on the *Create+* button:
+
====

image:console_create.png["Console Create"]
====

2. Enter the repository URL for the application to build:
+
====

image:console_enter_source_uri.png["Enter Source Repository"]
====

3. Select a builder image from the list of images in your project, or provided by
the global library:
+
====

image:console_select_image.png["Select Builder Image"]
====

4. Modify the settings in the new application screen to configure the resources that will support your application:
+
====

image:create_from_image.png["Create from source"]
====
<1> The builder image name and description.
<2> The application name used for the generated OpenShift resources.
<3> Routing configuration section for making the application publicly accessible.
<4> Deployment configuration section for customizing deployment triggers and image environment variables.
<5> Build configuration section for customizing build triggers.
<6> Replica scaling section for configuring the number of running instances of the application.
<7> The labels to assign to all items generated for the application. You can add and edit labels for all resources here.
