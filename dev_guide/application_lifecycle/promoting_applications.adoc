== Overview

Application promotion means moving an application through various runtime
environments, typically with an increasing level of maturity. For example, an
application might start out in a development environment, then be promoted to a
stage environment for further testing, before finally being promoted into a
production environment. As changes are introduced in the application, again the
changes will start in development and be promoted through stage and production.

The "application" today is more than just the source code written in Java, Perl,
Python, etc. It is more now than the static web content, the integration
scripts, or the associated configuration for the language specific runtimes for
the application. It is more than the application specific archives consumed by
those language specific runtimes.

In the context of {product-title} and its combined foundation of Kubernetes and
Docker, additional application artifacts include:

* _Docker container images_ with their rich set of metadata and associated tooling.
* _Environment variables_ that are injected into containers for application use.
* _API objects_ (also known as resource definitions; see xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/index.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-index[Core Concepts]) of {product-title}, which:
** are injected into containers for application use.
** dictate how {product-title} manages containers and pods.

In examining how to promote applications in {product-title}, this topic will:

* Elaborate on these new artifacts introduced to the application definition.
* Describe how you can demarcate the different environments for your application promotion pipeline.
* Discuss methodologies and tools for managing these new artifacts.
* Provide examples that apply the various concepts, constructs, methodologies, and tools to application promotion.

[[dev-guide-promoting-applications-components]]
== Application Components

[[dev-guide-promoting-applications-api-objects]]
=== API Objects

With regard to {product-title} and Kubernetes resource definitions (the items
newly introduced to the application inventory), there are a couple of key design
points for these API objects that are relevant to revisit when considering the
topic of application promotion.

First, as highlighted throughout {product-title} documentation, every API object
can be expressed via either JSON or YAML, making it easy to manage these
resource definitions via traditional source control and scripting.

Also, the API objects are designed such that there are portions of the object
which specify the desired state of the system, and other portions which reflect
the status or current state of the system. This can be thought of as inputs and
outputs. The input portions, when expressed in JSON or YAML, in particular are
items that fit naturally as source control managed (SCM) artifacts.

[NOTE]
====
Remember, the input or specification portions of the API objects can be totally
static or dynamic in the sense that
xref:../templates.adoc#writing-parameters[variable substitution via template
processing] is possible on instantiation.
====

The result of these points with respect to API objects is that with their
expression as JSON or YAML files, you can treat the configuration of the
application  as code.

Conceivably, almost any of the API objects may be considered an application
artifact by your organization. Listed below are the objects most commonly
associated with deploying and managing an application:

BuildConfigs:: This is a special case resource in the context of application
promotion. While a `BuildConfig` is certainly a part of the application,
especially from a developer's perspective, typically the `BuildConfig` is not
promoted through the pipeline. It produces the `Image` that is promoted (along
with other items) through the pipeline.
Templates:: In terms of application promotion, `Templates` can serve as the
starting point for setting up resources in a given staging environment,
especially with the parameterization capabilities. Additional post-instantiation
modifications are very conceivable though when applications move through a
promotion pipeline. See
xref:dev-guide-promoting-applications-scenarios[Scenarios and Examples] for more
on this.
Routes:: These are the most typical resources that differ stage to stage in the
application promotion pipeline, as tests against different stages of an
application access that application via its `Route`. Also, remember that you have
options with regard to manual specification or auto-generation of host names, as
well as the HTTP-level security of the `Route`.
Services:: If reasons exist to avoid `Routers` and `Routes` at given application
promotion stages (perhaps for simplicity's sake for individual developers at
early stages), an application can be accessed via the `Cluster` IP address and
port. If used, some management of the address and port between stages could be
warranted.
Endpoints:: Certain application-level services (e.g., database instances in many
enterprises) may not be managed by {product-title}. If so, then creating those
`Endpoints` yourself, along with the necessary modifications to the associated
`Service` (omitting the selector field on the `Service`) are activities that are
either duplicated or shared between stages (based on how you delineate your
environment).
Secrets:: The sensitive information encapsulated by `Secrets` are shared between
staging environments when the corresponding entity (either a `Service` managed
by {product-title} or an external service managed outside of {product-title})
the information pertains to is shared. If there are different versions of the
said entity in different stages of your application promotion pipeline, it may
be necessary to maintain a distinct `Secret` in each stage of the pipeline or to
make modifications to it as it traverses through the pipeline. Also, take care
that if you are storing the `Secret` as JSON or YAML in an SCM, some form of
encryption to protect the sensitive information may be warranted.
DeploymentConfigs:: This object is the primary resource for defining and scoping
the environment for a given application promotion pipeline stage; it controls
how your application starts up. While there are aspects of it that will be
common across all the different stage, undoubtedly there will be modifications
to this object as it progresses through your application promotion pipeline to
reflect differences in the environments for each stage, or changes in behavior
of the system to facilitate testing of the different scenarios your application
must support.
ImageStreams, ImageStreamTags, and ImageStreamImage:: Detailed in the
xref:dev-guide-promoting-application-images[Images] and
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[Image
Streams] sections, these objects are central to the {product-title} additions
around managing container images.
ServiceAccounts and RoleBindings:: Management of permissions to other API
objects within {product-title}, as well as the external services, are intrinsic
to managing your application. Similar to `Secrets`, the `ServiceAccounts` and
`RoleBindingscan` objects vary in how they are shared between the different
stages of your application promotion pipeline based on your needs to share or
isolate those different environments.
PersistentVolumeClaims:: Relevant to stateful services like databases, how much
these are shared between your different application promotion stages directly
correlates to how your organization shares or isolates the copies of your
application data.
ConfigMaps:: A useful decoupling of `Pod` configuration from the `Pod` itself
(think of an environment variable style configuration), these can either be
shared by the various staging environments when consistent `Pod` behavior is
desired. They can also be modified between stages to alter `Pod` behavior
(usually as different aspects of the application are vetted at different
stages).

[[dev-guide-promoting-application-images]]
=== Images

As noted earlier, container images are now artifacts of your application. In
fact, of the new applications artifacts, images and the management of images are
the key pieces with respect to application promotion. In some cases, an image
might encapsulate the entirety of your application, and the application
promotion flow consists solely of managing the image.

Images are not typically managed in a SCM system, just as application binaries
were not in previous systems. However, just as with binaries, installable
artifacts and corresponding repositories (that is, RPMs, RPM repositories, Nexus,
etc.) arose with similar semantics to SCMs, similar constructs and terminology
around image management that are similar to SCMs have arisen:

* Image registry == SCM server
* Image repository == SCM repository

As images reside in registries, application promotion is concerned with ensuring
the appropriate image exists in a registry that can be accessed from the
environment that needs to run the application represented by that image.

Rather than reference images directly, application definitions typically
abstract the reference into an image stream. This means the image stream will be
another API object that makes up the application components. For more details on
image streams, see
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[Core
Concepts].

[[dev-guide-promoting-application-components-summary]]
=== Summary

Now that the application artifacts of note, images and API objects, have been
detailed in the context of application promotion within {product-title}, the
notion of _where_ you run your application in the various stages of your
promotion pipeline is next the point of discussion.

[[dev-guide-promoting-application-de]]
== Deployment Environments

A deployment environment, in this context, describes a distinct space for an
application to run during a particular stage of a CI/CD pipeline. Typical
environments include *development*, *test*, *stage*, and *production*, for
example. The boundaries of an environment can be defined in different ways, such
as:

* Via labels and unique naming within a single project.
* Via distinct projects within a cluster.
* Via distinct clusters.

And it is conceivable that your organization leverages all three.

[[dev-guide-promoting-application-de-considerations]]
=== Considerations

Typically, you will consider the following heuristics in how you structure the
deployment environments:

* How much resource sharing the various stages of your promotion flow allow
* How much isolation the various stages of your promotion flow require
* How centrally located (or geographically dispersed) the various stages of your promotion flow are

Also, some important reminders on how {product-title} clusters and projects
relate to image registries:

* Multiple project in the same cluster can access the same image streams.
* Multiple clusters can access the same external registries.
* Clusters can only share a registry if the {product-title} internal image registry is exposed via a route.

[[dev-guide-promoting-application-de-summary]]
=== Summary

After deployment environments are defined, promotion flows with delineation of
stages within a pipeline can be implemented. The methods and tools for
constructing those promotion flow implementations are the next point of
discussion.

[[dev-guide-promoting-applications-methods-tools]]
== Methods and Tools

Fundamentally, application promotion is a process of moving the aforementioned
application components from one environment to another. The following
subsections outline tools that can be used to move the various components by
hand, before advancing to discuss holistic solutions for automating application
promotion.

[NOTE]
====
There are a number of insertion points available during both the build and
deployment processes. They are defined within `BuildConfig` and
`DeploymentConfig` API objects. These hooks allow for the invocation of custom
scripts which can interact with deployed components such as databases, and with
the {product-title} cluster itself.

Therefore, it is possible to use these hooks to perform component management
operations that effectively move applications between environments, for example
by performing an image tag operation from within a hook. However, the various
hook points are best suited to managing an application's lifecycle within a
given environment (for example, using them to perform database schema migrations
when a new version of the application is deployed), rather than to move
application components between environments.
====

[[dev-guide-promoting-application-managing-api-objects]]
=== Managing API Objects

Resources, as defined in one environment, will be exported as JSON or YAML file
content in preparation for importing it into a new environment. Therefore, the
expression of API objects as JSON or YAML serves as the unit of work as you
promote API objects through your application pipeline. The `oc` CLI is used to
export and import this content.

[TIP]
====
While not required for promotion flows with {product-title}, with the JSON or
YAML stored in files, you can consider storing and retrieving the content from a
SCM system. This allows you to leverage the versioning related capabilities of
the SCM, including the creation of branches, and the assignment of and query on
various labels or tags associated to versions.
====

[[dev-guide-promoting-application-exporting-api-object-state]]
==== Exporting API Object State

API object specifications should be captured with `oc export`. This operation
removes environment specific data from the object definitions (e.g., current
namespace or assigned IP addresses), allowing them to be recreated in different
environments (unlike `oc get` operations, which output an unfiltered state of
the object).

Use of `oc label`, which allows for adding, modifying, or removing labels on API
objects, can prove useful as you organize the set of object collected for
promotion flows, because labels allow for selection and management of groups of
pods in a single operation. This makes it easier to export the correct set of
objects and, because the labels will carry forward when the objects are created
in a new environment, they also make for easier management of the application
components in each environment.

[NOTE]
====
API objects often contain references such as a `DeploymentConfig` that
references a `Secret`. When moving an API object from one environment to
another, you must ensure that such references are also moved to the new
environment.

Similarly, API objects such as a `DeploymentConfig` often contain references to
`ImageStreams` that reference an external registry. When moving an API object
from one environment to another, you must ensure such references are resolvable
within the new environment, meaning that the reference must be resolvable and
the `ImageStream` must reference an accessible registry in the new environment.
See xref:dev-guide-promoting-applications-moving-images[Moving Images] and
xref:dev-guide-promoting-applications-caveats[Promotion Caveats] for more
detail.
====

[[dev-guide-promoting-applications-importing-api-object-state]]
==== Importing API Object State

[[dev-guide-promoting-applications-initial-creation]]
===== Initial Creation

The first time an application is being introduced into a new environment, it is
sufficient to take the JSON or YAML expressing the specifications of your API
objects and run `oc create` to create them in the appropriate environment. When
using `oc create`, keep the `--save-config` option in mind. Saving configuration
elements on the object in its annotation list facilitates the later use of `oc
apply` to modify the object.

[[dev-guide-promoting-applications-iterative-modification]]
===== Iterative Modification

After the various staging environments are initially established, as promotion
cycles commence and the application moves from stage to stage, the updates to
your application can include modification of the API objects that are part of
the application. Changes in these API objects are conceivable since they
represent the configuration for the {product-title} system. Motivations for such
changes include:

* Accounting for environmental differences between staging environments.
* Verifying various scenarios your application supports.

Transfer of the API objects to the next stage's environment is accomplished via
use of the `oc` CLI. While a rich set of `oc` commands which modify API objects
exist, this topic focuses on `oc apply`, which computes and applies differences
between objects.

Specifically, you can view `oc apply` as a three-way merge that takes in files or stdin as the input along with an existing object definition. It performs a three-way merge between:

. the input into the command,
. the current version of the object, and
. the most recent user specified object definition stored as an annotation in the current object.

The existing object is then updated with the result.

If further customization of the API objects is necessary, as in the case when
the objects are not expected to be identical between the source and target
environments, `oc` commands such as `oc set` can be used to modify the object
after applying the latest object definitions from the upstream environment.

Some specific usages are cited in xref:dev-guide-promoting-applications-scenarios[Scenarios and
Examples].

[[dev-guide-promoting-applications-managing-images]]
=== Managing Images and Image Streams

Images in {product-title} are managed via a series of API objects as well.
However, managing images are so central to application promotion that discussion
of the tools and API objects most directly tied to images warrant separate
discussion. Both manual and automated forms exist to assist you in managing
image promotion (the propagation of images through your pipeline).

[[dev-guide-promoting-applications-moving-images]]
==== Moving Images

For all the detailed caveats around managing images, refer to the
xref:../managing_images.adoc#dev-guide-managing-images[Managing Images] topic.
====

[[dev-guide-promoting-applications-environments-share-a-registry]]
===== When Staging Environments Share a Registry

When your staging environments share the same {product-title} registry, for
example if they are all on the same {product-title} cluster, there are two
operations that are the basic means of _moving_ your images between the stages
of your application promotion pipeline:

. First, analogous to `docker tag` and `git tag`, the `oc tag` command allows you
to update an {product-title} image stream with a reference to a specific image.
It also allows you to copy references to specific versions of an image from one
image stream to another, even across different projects in a cluster.
. Second, the `oc import-image` serves as a bridge between external registries and
image streams. It imports the metadata for a given image from the registry and
stores it into the image stream as an
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-stream-tag[image
stream tag]. Various `BuildConfigs` and `DeploymentConfigs` in your project can
reference those specific images.

[[dev-guide-promoting-applications-environments-different-registries]]
===== When Staging Environments Use Different Registries

More advanced usage occurs when your staging environments leverage different
{product-title} registries.
xref:../../dev_guide/managing_images.adoc#accessing-the-internal-registry[Accessing
the Internal Registry] spells out the steps in detail, but in summary you can:

. Use the `docker` command in conjunction which obtaining the {product-title}
access token to supply into your `docker login` command.
. After being logged into the {product-title} registry, use `docker pull`, `docker
tag` and `docker push` to transfer the image.
. After the image is available in the registry of the next environment of your
pipeline, use `oc tag` as needed to populate any image streams.

[[dev-guide-promoting-applications-deploying]]
==== Deploying

Whether changing the underlying application image or the API objects that
configure the application, a deployment is typically necessary to pick up the
promoted changes. If the images for your application change (for example, due to
an `oc tag` operation or a `docker push` as part of promoting an image from an
upstream environment), `ImageChangeTriggers` on your `DeploymentConfig` can
trigger the new deployment. Similarly, if the `DeploymentConfig` API object
itself is being changed, a `ConfigChangeTrigger` can initiate a deployment when
the API object is updated by the promotion step (for example, `oc apply`).

Otherwise, the `oc` commands that facilitate manual deployment include:

* `oc deploy`: The original method to view, start, cancel, or retry deployments.
* `oc rollout`: The new approach to manage deployments, including pause and resume semantics and richer features around managing history.
* `oc rollback`: Allows for reversion to a previous deployment; in the promotion scenario, if testing of a new version encounters issues, confirming it still works with the previous version could be warranted.

[[dev-guide-promoting-applications-automating-promotion-flows]]
==== Automating Promotion Flows with Jenkins

After you understand the components of your application that need to be moved
between environments when promoting it and the steps required to move the
components, you can start to orchestrate and automate the workflow.
{product-title} provides a Jenkins image and plug-ins to help with this process.

The {product-title} Jenkins image is detailed in
xref:../../using_images/other_images/jenkins.adoc#using-images-other-images-jenkins[Using
Images], including the set of {product-title}-centric plug-ins that facilitate
the integration of Jenkins, and Jenkins Pipelines.  Also, the
xref:../builds/build_strategies.adoc#pipeline-strategy-options[Pipeline build strategy]
facilitates the integration between Jenkins Pipelines and {product-title}. All
of these focus on enabling various aspects of CI/CD, including application
promotion.

When moving beyond manual execution of application promotion steps, the
Jenkins-related features provided by {product-title} should be kept in mind:

* {product-title} provides a Jenkins image that is heavily customized to greatly
ease deployment in an {product-title} cluster.
* The Jenkins image contains the OpenShift Pipeline plug-in, which provides
building blocks for implementing promotion workflows. These building blocks
include the triggering of Jenkins jobs as image streams change, as well as the
triggering of builds and deployments within those jobs.
* `BuildConfigs` employing the {product-title} Jenkins Pipeline build strategy
enable execution of Jenkinsfile-based Jenkins Pipeline jobs. Pipeline jobs are
the strategic direction within Jenkins for complex promotion flows and can
leverage the steps provided by the OpenShift Pipeline Plug-in.

[[dev-guide-promoting-applications-caveats]]
==== Promotion Caveats

[[dev-guide-promoting-applications-caveats-api-object-refs]]
===== API Object References

API objects can reference other objects. A common use for this is to have a
`DeploymentConfig` that references an image stream, but other reference
relationships may also exist.

When copying an API object from one environment to another, it is critical that
all references can still be resolved in the target environment. There are a few
reference scenarios to consider:

* The reference is "local" to the project. In this case, the referenced object
resides in the same project as the object that references it. Typically the
correct thing to do is to ensure that you copy the referenced object into the
target environment in the same project as the object referencing it.
* The reference is to an object in another project. This is typical when an image
stream in a shared project is used by multiple application projects (see
xref:../managing_images.adoc#allowing-pods-to-reference-images-across-projects[Managing
Images]). In this case, when copying the referencing object to the new
environment, you must update the reference as needed so it can be resolved in
the target environment. That may mean:
** Changing the project the reference points to, if the shared project has a
different name in the target environment.
** Moving the referenced object from the shared project into the local project in
the target environment and updating the reference to point to the local project
when moving the primary object into the target environment.
** Some other combination of copying the referenced object into the target
environment and updating references to it.

In general, the guidance is to consider objects referenced by the objects being
copied to a new environment and ensure the references are resolvable in the
target environment. If not, take appropriate action to fix the references and
make the referenced objects available in the target environment.

[[dev-guide-promoting-applications-caveats-image-registry-refs]]
===== Image Registry References

Image streams point to image repositories to indicate the source of the image
they represent. When an image stream is moved from one environment to another,
it is important to consider whether the registry and repository reference should
also change:

* If different image registries are used to assert isolation between a test
environment and a production environment.
* If different image repositories are used to separate test and production-ready
images.

If either of these are the case, the image stream must be modified when it is
copied from the source environment to the target environment so that it resolves
to the correct image. This is in addition to performing the steps described in
xref:dev-guide-promoting-applications-repeatable-process[Scenarios and Examples]
to copy the image from one registry and repository to another.

[[dev-guide-promoting-applications-methods-tools-summary]]
=== Summary

At this point, the following have been defined:

* New application artifacts that make up a deployed application.
* Correlation of application promotion activities to tools and concepts provided by {product-title}.
* Integration between {product-title} and the CI/CD pipeline engine Jenkins.

Putting together examples of application promotion flows within {product-title}
is the final step for this topic.

[[dev-guide-promoting-applications-scenarios]]
== Scenarios and Examples

Having defined the new application artifact components introduced by the Docker,
Kubernetes, and {product-title} ecosystems, this section covers how to
promote those components between environments using the mechanisms and
tools provided by {product-title}.

Of the components making up an application, the image is the primary artifact of
note. Taking that premise and extending it to application promotion, the core,
fundamental application promotion pattern is image promotion, where the unit of
work is the image. The vast majority of application promotion scenarios entails
management and propagation of the image through the promotion pipeline.

Simpler scenarios solely deal with managing and propagating the image through
the pipeline. As the promotion scenarios broaden in scope, the other application
artifacts, most notably the API objects, are included in the inventory of items
managed and propagated through the pipeline.

This topic lays out some specific examples around promoting images as well as
API objects, using both manual and automated approaches. But first, note the
following on setting up the environment(s) for your application promotion
pipeline.

[[dev-guide-promoting-applications-setting-up]]
=== Setting up for Promotion

After you have completed development of the initial revision of your
application, the next logical step is to package up the contents of the
application so that you can transfer to the subsequent staging environments of
your promotion pipeline.

. First, group all the API objects you view as transferable and apply a common
`label` to them:
+
----
labels:
  promotion-group: <application_name>
----
+
As previously described, the `oc label` command facilitates the management of
labels with your various API objects.
+
[TIP]
====
If you initially define your API objects in a {product-title} template, you can
easily ensure all related objects have the common label you will use to query on
when exporting in preparation for a promotion.
====

. You can leverage that label on subsequent queries. For example, consider the
following set of `oc` command invocations that would then achieve the transfer
of your application's API objects:
+
----
$ oc login <source_environment>
$ oc project <source_project>
$ oc export dc,is,svc,route,secret,sa -l promotion-group=<application_name> -o yaml > export.yaml
$ oc login <target_environment>
$ oc new-project <target_project> <1>
$ oc create -f export.yaml
----
<1> Alternatively, `oc project <target_project>` if it already exists.
+
[NOTE]
====
On the `oc export` command, whether or not you include the `is` type for image
streams depends on how you choose to manage images, image streams, and
registries across the different environments in your pipeline. The caveats
around this are discussed below. See also the
xref:../managing_images.adoc#dev-guide-managing-images[Managing Images] topic.
====

. You must also get any tokens necessary to operate against each registry used in
the different staging environments in your promotion pipeline. For each environment:

.. Log in to the environment:
+
----
$ oc login <each_environment_with_a_unique_registry>
----

.. Get the access token with:
+
----
$ oc whoami -t
----

.. Copy and paste the token value for later use.

[[dev-guide-promoting-applications-repeatable-process]]
=== Repeatable Promotion Process

After the initial setup of the different staging environments for your pipeline,
a set of repeatable steps to validate each iteration of your application through
the promotion pipeline can commence. These basic steps are taken each time the
image or API objects in the source environment are changed:

Move updated images -> Move updated API objects -> Apply environment specific customizations

. Typically, the first step is promoting any updates to the image(s) associated
with your application to the next stage in the pipeline. As noted above, the key
differentiator in promoting images is whether the {product-title} registry is
shared or not between staging environments.

.. If the registry is shared, simply leverage `oc tag`:
+
----
$ oc tag <project_for_stage_N>/<imagestream_name_for_stage_N>:<tag_for_stage_N> <project_for_stage_N+1>/<imagestream_name_for_stage_N+1>:<tag_for_stage_N+1>
----

.. If the registry is not shared, you can leverage the access tokens for each of
your promotion pipeline registries as you log into both the source and
destination registries, pulling, tagging, and pushing your application images
accordingly:

... Log in to the source environment registry:
+
----
$ docker login -u <username> -e <any_email_address> -p <token_value> <src_env_registry_ip>:<port>
----

... Pull your application's image:
+
----
$ docker pull <src_env_registry_ip>:<port>/<namespace>/<image name>:<tag>
----

... Tag your application's image to the destination registry's location, updating
namespace, name, and tag as needed to conform to the destination staging
environment:
+
----
$ docker tag <src_env_registry_ip>:<port>/<namespace>/<image name>:<tag> <dest_env_registry_ip>:<port>/<namespace>/<image name>:<tag>
----

... Log into the destination staging environment registry:
+
----
$ docker login -u <username> -e <any_email_address> -p <token_value> <dest_env_registry_ip>:<port>
----

... Push the image to its destination:
+
----
$ docker push <dest_env_registry_ip>:<port>/<namespace>/<image name>:<tag>
----
+
[TIP]
====
To automatically import new versions of an image from an external registry, the
`oc tag` command has a `--scheduled` option. If used, the image the
`ImageStreamTag` references will be periodically pulled from the registry
hosting the image.
====

. Next, there are the cases where the evolution of your application necessitates
fundamental changes to your API objects or additions and deletions from the set
of API objects that make up the application. When such evolution in your
application's API objects occurs, the {product-title} CLI provides a broad range
of options to transfer to changes from one staging environment to the next.

.. Start in the same fashion as you did when you initially set up your promotion
pipeline:
+
----
$ oc login <source_environment>
$ oc project <source_project>
$ oc export dc,is,svc,route,secret,sa -l promotion-group=<application_name> -o yaml > export.yaml
$ oc login <target_environment>
$ oc <target_project>
----

.. Rather than simply creating the resources in the new environment, update them. You can do this a few different ways:

... The more conservative approach is to leverage `oc apply` and merge the new
changes to each API object in the target environment. In doing so, you can
`--dry-run=true` option and examine the resulting objects prior to actually
changing the objects:
+
----
$ oc apply -f export.yaml --dry-run=true
----
+
If satisfied, actually run the `apply` command:
+
----
$ oc apply -f export.yaml
----
+
The `apply` command optionally takes additional arguments that help with more
complicated scenarios. See `oc apply --help` for more details.

... Alternatively, the simpler but more aggressive approach is to leverage `oc
replace`. There is no dry run with this update and replace. In the most basic
form, this involves executing:
+
----
$ oc replace -f export.yaml
----
+
As with `apply`, `replace` optionally takes additional arguments for more
sophisticated behavior. See `oc replace --help` for more details.

. The previous steps automatically handle new API objects that were introduced,
but if API objects were deleted from the source environment, they must be
manually deleted from the target environment using `oc delete`.

. Tuning of the environment variables cited on any of the API objects may be
necessary as the desired values for those may differ between staging
environments. For this, use `oc set env`:
+
----
$ oc set env <api_object_type>/<api_object_ID> <env_var_name>=<env_var_value>
----

. Finally, trigger a new deployment of the updated application using the `oc
rollout` command or one of the other mechanisms discussed in the

=== Repeatable Promotion Process Using Jenkins

The
link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/blob/master/2/contrib/openshift/configuration/jobs/OpenShift%20Sample/config.xml[OpenShift Sample] job defined in the link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins[Jenkins
Docker Image] for {product-title} is an example of image promotion within
{product-title} within the constructs of Jenkins. Setup for this sample is
located in the
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/README.md[OpenShift Origin source repository].


This sample includes:

* Use of *Jenkins as the CI/CD engine*.
* Use of the *OpenShift Pipeline plug-in for Jenkins*. This plug-in provides a
subset of the functionality provided by the `oc` CLI for {product-title}
packaged as Jenkins Freestyle and DSL Job steps. Note that the `oc` binary is
also included in the Jenkins Docker Image for {product-title}, and can also be
used to interact with {product-title} in Jenkins jobs.
* The {product-title}-provided *templates for Jenkins*. There is a template for
both ephemeral and persistent storage.
* A *sample application*: defined in the
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/application-template.json[OpenShift
Origin source repository], this application leverages `ImageStreams`,
`ImageChangeTriggers`, `ImageStreamTags`, `BuildConfigs`, and separate
`DeploymentConfigs` and `Services` corresponding to different stages in the
promotion pipeline.

The following examines the various pieces of the OpenShift Sample job in more
detail:

. link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/blob/master/2/contrib/openshift/configuration/jobs/OpenShift%20Sample/config.xml#L15-L21[The first step] is the equivalent of an `oc scale dc frontend --replicas=0`
call. This step is intended to bring down any previous versions of the
application image that may be running.

. link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/blob/master/2/contrib/openshift/configuration/jobs/OpenShift%20Sample/config.xml#L23-L29[The second step] is the equivalent of an `oc start-build frontend` call.

. link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/blob/master/2/contrib/openshift/configuration/jobs/OpenShift%20Sample/config.xml#L31-L39[The third step] is the equivalent of an `oc deploy frontend --latest` or `oc rollout
latest dc/frontend` call.

. link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/blob/master/2/contrib/openshift/configuration/jobs/OpenShift%20Sample/config.xml#L41-47[The fourth step] is the "test" for this sample. It ensures that the associated
service for this application is in fact accessible from a network perspective.
Under the covers, a socket connection is attempted against the IP address and
port associated with the {product-title} service. Of course, additional tests
can be added (if not via OpenShift Pipepline plug-in steps, then via use of the
Jenkins Shell step to leverage OS-level commands and scripts to test your
application).

. link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/blob/master/2/contrib/openshift/configuration/jobs/OpenShift%20Sample/config.xml#L49-L61[The fifth step] commences under that assumption that the testing of your application
passed and hence intends to mark the image as "ready". In this step, a new
*prod* tag is created for the application image off of the *latest* image. With
the *frontend* `DeploymentConfig` having an `ImageChangeTrigger`
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/application-template.json#L75-L87[defined for that tag], the corresponding "production" deployment is launched.

. link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/blob/master/2/contrib/openshift/configuration/jobs/OpenShift%20Sample/config.xml#L63-L73[The sixth and last step] is a verification step, where the plug-in confirms that
{product-title} launched the desired number of replicas for the "production"
deployment.
