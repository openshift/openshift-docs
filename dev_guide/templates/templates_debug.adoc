== I do not see templates in my project

The default templates with {product-title} need to be created, or loaded, in your project before you can work with them.

Your cluster administrator should have created these templates in the default, global *openshift* project so you have access to
them.  

If you run the following command and do not see list of templates in the output, the templates might need to be loaded into your project: 

----
$ oc get templates

No resources found
----

===== Resolution

If the output of the `oc get templates` command is empty, your administrator needs to load the default templates into your project. For information, 
see xref:../../dev_guide/templates/templates_load.adoc#dev-guide-templates-loading[Loading Default Templates].
