[NOTE]
====
For easy device plug-in reference implementation, there is a stub device plug-in
in the xref:../dev_guide/device_manager.adoc#using-device-manager[Device
Manager] code:
*_vendor/k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/kubelet/cm/deviceplugin/device_plugin_stub.go_*.

== Methods for Deploying a Device Plug-in

* xref:../dev_guide/daemonsets.adoc#dev-guide-daemonsets[Daemonsets]
are the recommended approach for device plug-in deployments.
* Upon start, the device plug-in will try to create a UNIX domain socket at
*_/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugin/_* on the node to serve RPCs from
xref:../dev_guide/device_manager.adoc#using-device-manager[Device Manager].
* Since device plug-ins need to manage hardware resources, access to the host
file system, as well as socket creation, they must be run in a privileged
security context.
* More specific details regarding deployment steps can be found with each device
plug-in implementation.
