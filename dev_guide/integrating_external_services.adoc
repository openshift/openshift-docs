== Overview

Many {product-title} applications use external resources, such as external
databases, or an external SaaS endpoint. These external resources can be modeled
as native {product-title} services, so that applications can work with them as
they would any other internal service.

xref:../admin_guide/managing_networking.adoc#admin-guide-controlling-egress-traffic[Egress
traffic] can be controlled by firewall rules or an Egress router. This permits
having a static IP address for their application service.

== Defining a Service for an External Database

One of the most common types of external services is an external database. To
support an external database, an application needs:

. An endpoint to communicate with.
. A set of credentials and coordinates, including:
+
* A user name
+
* A passphrase
+
* A database name

The solution for integrating with an external database includes:

- A `Service` object to represent the SaaS provider as an {product-title} service.
- One or more `Endpoints` for the service.
- Environment variables in the appropriate pods containing the credentials.

The following steps outline a scenario for integrating with an external MySQL
database:

=== Step 1: Define a Service
You can define a service either by providing an IP address and endpoints, or
by providing a Fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

[[mysql-define-service-using-ip-address]]
==== Using an IP address

. Create an
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[{product-title}
service] to represent your external database. This is similar to creating an
internal service; the difference is in the service's `Selector` field.
+
Internal {product-title} services use the `Selector` field to associate pods with
services using
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[labels]. The
`EndpointsController` system component synchronizes the endpoints for services
that specify selectors with the pods that match the selector. The
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#service-proxy[service
proxy] and {product-title}
xref:../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#routers[router] load-balance
requests to the service amongst the service's endpoints.
+
Services that represent an external resource do not require associated pods.
Instead, leave the `Selector` field unset. This represents the external service,
making the `EndpointsController` ignore the service and allows you to specify
endpoints manually:
+
[source, yaml]
----
  kind: "Service"
  apiVersion: "v1"
  metadata:
    name: "external-mysql-service"
  spec:
    ports:
      -
        name: "mysql"
        protocol: "TCP"
        port: 3306
        targetPort: 3306 <1> 
        nodePort: 0
  selector: {} <2>
----
<1> Optional: The port on the backing pods to which the service forwards connections.
<2> The `selector` field to leave blank.

. Next, create the required endpoints for the service. This gives the service
proxy and router the location to send traffic directed to the service:
+
[source, yaml]
----
  kind: "Endpoints"
  apiVersion: "v1"
  metadata:
    name: "external-mysql-service" <1>
  subsets: <2>
    -
      addresses:
        -
          ip: "10.0.0.0" <3>
      ports:
        -
          port: 3306 <4>
          name: "mysql"

----
<1> The name of the `Service` instance, as defined in the previous step.
<2> Traffic to the service will be load-balanced between the supplied
`Endpoints` if more than one is supplied.
<3> Endpoints IPs
http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services/#services-without-selectors[cannot
be] loopback (127.0.0.0/8), link-local (169.254.0.0/16), or link-local multicast
(224.0.0.0/24).
<4> The `*port*` and `*name*` definition must match the `*port*` and `*name*`
value in the service defined in the previous step.

[[mysql-define-service-using-fqdn]]
==== Using an External Domain Name

Using external domain names make it easier to manage an external service
linkage, because you do not have to worry about the external service's IP
addresses changing.

`ExternalName` services do not have selectors, or any defined ports or
endpoints, therefore, you can use an `ExternalName` service to direct traffic to
an external service.

[source, yaml]
----
kind: "Service"
apiVersion: "v1"
metadata:
  name: "external-mysql-service"
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: example.domain.name
selector: {} <1>
----
<1> The `selector` field to leave blank.

Using an external domain name service tells the system that the DNS name in the
`externalName` field (`example.domain.name` in the previous example) is the
location of the resource that backs the service. When a DNS request is made
against the Kubernetes DNS server, it returns the `externalName` in a CNAME
record telling the client to look up the returned name to get the IP address.

=== Step 2: Consume a Service

Now that the service and endpoints are defined, give the appropriate pods
access to the credentials to use the service by setting environment variables in
the appropriate containers:

[source, yaml]
----
kind: "DeploymentConfig"
apiVersion: "v1"
metadata:
  name: "my-app-deployment"
spec: <1>
  strategy:
    type: "Rolling"
    rollingParams:
      updatePeriodSeconds: 1 <2>
      intervalSeconds: 1 <3>
      timeoutSeconds: 120
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    name: "frontend"
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: "frontend"
    spec:
      containers:
        -
          name: "helloworld"
          image: "origin-ruby-sample"
          ports:
            -
              containerPort: 3306
              protocol: "TCP"
          env:
            -
              name: "MYSQL_USER"
              value: "${MYSQL_USER}" <4>
            -
              name: "MYSQL_PASSWORD"
              value: "${MYSQL_PASSWORD}" <5>
            -
              name: "MYSQL_DATABASE"
              value: "${MYSQL_DATABASE}" <6>
----

<1> Other fields on the `DeploymentConfig` are omitted
<2> The time to wait between individual pod updates.
<3> The time to wait between polling the deployment status after update.
<4> The user name to use with the service.
<5> The passphrase to use with the service.
<6> The database name.

*External Database Environment Variables*

Using an external service in your application is similar to using an internal
service. Your application will be assigned environment variables for the service
and the additional environment variables with the credentials described in the
previous step. For example, a MySQL container receives the following environment
variables:

- `*EXTERNAL_MYSQL_SERVICE_SERVICE_HOST=<ip_address>*`
- `*EXTERNAL_MYSQL_SERVICE_SERVICE_PORT=<port_number>*`
- `*MYSQL_USERNAME=<mysql_username>*`
- `*MYSQL_PASSWORD=<mysql_password>*`
- `*MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME=<mysql_database>*`

The application is responsible for reading the coordinates and credentials for
the service from the environment and establishing a connection with the database
via the service.

== External SaaS Provider

A common type of external service is an external SaaS endpoint. To support an
external SaaS provider, an application needs:

1. An endpoint to communicate with
2. A set of credentials, such as:
   a.  An API key
   b.  A user name
   c.  A passphrase

////
The formula for integrating with this type of external resource is fairly simple. The pieces of the
solution are:

1.  A `Service` object to represent the SaaS provider as an {product-title} service
2.  One or more `Endpoints` for the service
3.  Environment variables in the appropriate pods that contain the credentials
////

The following steps outline a scenario for integrating with an external SaaS
provider:

[[saas-define-service-using-ip-address]]
=== Using an IP address and Endpoints

. Create an xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[{product-title} service] to represent the external service. This is similar to creating an internal service; however the difference is in the service's `Selector` field.
+
Internal {product-title} services use the `Selector` field to associate pods with
services using
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[labels]. A
system component called `EndpointsController` synchronizes the endpoints for
services that specify selectors with the pods that match the selector. The
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#service-proxy[service
proxy] and {product-title}
xref:../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#routers[router] load-balance
requests to the service amongst the service's endpoints.
+
Services that represents an external resource do not require that pods be
associated with it. Instead, leave the `Selector` field unset. This makes the
`EndpointsController` ignore the service and allows you to specify endpoints
manually:
+
[source, yaml]
----
  kind: "Service"
  apiVersion: "v1"
  metadata:
    name: "example-external-service"
  spec:
    ports:
      -
        name: "mysql"
        protocol: "TCP"
        port: 3306
        targetPort: 3306 <1>
        nodePort: 0
  selector: {} <2>
----
<1> Optional: The port on the backing pods to which the service forwards connections. 
<2> The `selector` field to leave blank.

. Next, create endpoints for the service containing the information about where
to send traffic directed to the service proxy and the router:
+
[source, yaml]
----
kind: "Endpoints"
apiVersion: "v1"
metadata:
  name: "example-external-service" <1>
subsets: <2>
- addresses:
  - ip: "10.10.1.1"
  ports:
  - name: "mysql"
    port: 3306
----
<1> The name of the `Service` instance.
<2> Traffic to the service is load-balanced between the `subsets` supplied here.

. Now that the service and endpoints are defined, give pods the credentials to
use the service by setting environment variables in the appropriate containers:
+
[source, yaml]
----
  kind: "DeploymentConfig"
  apiVersion: "v1"
  metadata:
    name: "my-app-deployment"
  spec:  <1>
    strategy:
      type: "Rolling"
      rollingParams:
        timeoutSeconds: 120
    replicas: 1
    selector:
      name: "frontend"
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          name: "frontend"
      spec:
        containers:
          -
            name: "helloworld"
            image: "openshift/openshift/origin-ruby-sample"
            ports:
              -
                containerPort: 3306
                protocol: "TCP"
            env:
              -
                name: "SAAS_API_KEY" <2>
                value: "<SaaS service API key>"
              -
                name: "SAAS_USERNAME" <3>
                value: "<SaaS service user>"
              -
                name: "SAAS_PASSPHRASE" <4>
                value: "<SaaS service passphrase>"

----
<1> Other fields on the `DeploymentConfig` are omitted.
<2> `SAAS_API_KEY`: The API key to use with the service.
<3> `SAAS_USERNAME`: The user name to use with the service.
<4> `SAAS_PASSPHRASE`: The passphrase to use with the service.

+
These variables get added to the containers as environment variables. Using environment variables allows service-to-service communication and it may or may not require additional parameters such as API keys, user name and password authentication, or certificates.

*External SaaS Provider Environment Variables*

Similarly, when using an internal service, your application is assigned
environment variables for the service and the additional environment variables
with the credentials described in the previous steps. In the previous example, the
container receives the following environment variables:

- `*EXAMPLE_EXTERNAL_SERVICE_SERVICE_HOST=<ip_address>*`
- `*EXAMPLE_EXTERNAL_SERVICE_SERVICE_PORT=<port_number>*`
- `*SAAS_API_KEY=<saas_api_key>*`
- `*SAAS_USERNAME=<saas_username>*`
- `*SAAS_PASSPHRASE=<saas_passphrase>*`

The application reads the coordinates and credentials for the service from the
environment and establishes a connection with the service.

[[saas-define-service-using-fqdn]]
=== Using an External Domain Name

`ExternalName` services do not have selectors, or any defined ports or
endpoints. You can use an `ExternalName` service to assign traffic to an
external service outside the cluster.

[source, yaml]
----
  kind: "Service"
  apiVersion: "v1"
  metadata:
    name: "external-mysql-service"
  spec:
    type: ExternalName
    externalName: example.domain.name
  selector: {} <1>
----
<1> The `selector` field to leave blank.

Using an `ExternalName` service maps the service to the value of the
`externalName` field (`example.domain.name` in the previous example), by
automatically injecting a CNAME record, mapping the service name directly to an
outside DNS address, and bypassing the need for endpoint records.
