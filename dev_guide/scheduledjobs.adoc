== Overview
A scheduled job, builds on top of a regular xref:../dev_guide/jobs.adoc[job] by
allowing to specify a schedule how the job should be run.
ScheduledJobs are part of the Kubernetes API, which can be managed with `oc` commands like other
xref:../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#object-types[object types].

See the http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/scheduled-jobs/[Kubernetes documentation] for
more information about scheduled jobs.

[NOTE]
Scheduled Jobs are a tech preview feature.

== Creating a Scheduled Job

A scheduled job configuration consists of the following key parts:

- A schedule specified in link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron[cron format].
- A job template, that will be used when creating next job.
- An optional deadline, for starting the job if it missed schedule.
- An optional concurrency policy, specifying how to treat concurrent jobs within a scheduled job.
 If not specified this defaults to allow concurrent executions.
- An optional flag allowing to suspend a scheduled job.

The following is an example of a `*scheduledjob*` resource:

====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: batch/v2alpha1
kind: ScheduledJob
metadata:
  name: pi
spec:
  schedule: */1 * * * ?    <1>
  jobTemplate:             <2>
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: pi
            image: perl
            command: ["perl",  "-Mbignum=bpi", "-wle", "print bpi(2000)"]
          restartPolicy: Never
----

1. Schedule for the job, this particular one will run a job every minute.
2. Job template, very similar to the xref:../dev_guide/jobs.adoc#creating-a-job[job example].
