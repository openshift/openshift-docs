== Overview

As a PaaS, {product-title} is designed for building and deploying applications.
Depending on how much you want to involve {product-title} in the development
process, you can choose to develop on {product-title} and use it to continuously
develop an application, or you can deploy a fully developed application onto an
{product-title} instance.

== Developing on {product-title}

You can develop your application on {product-title} directly. Use the following
process if you plan to use {product-title} as a method to build and deploy your
application:

Initial Planning::
* What does your application do?
* What programming language will it be developed in?

Access to {product-title}::
* {product-title} should be installed by this point, either by yourself or an
administrator within your organization.

Develop::
* Using your editor/IDE of choice, create a basic skeleton of an application. It
should be developed enough to tell {product-title}
xref:../dev_guide/new_app.adoc#language-detection[what kind of application it
is].
* Push the code to your Git repository.

Generate::
* xref:../dev_guide/new_app.adoc#dev-guide-new-app[Create a basic application] using the `new-app`
command. {product-title} generates build and deployment configurations.

Manage::
* Start developing your application code.
* Ensure your application builds successfully.
* Continue to locally develop and polish your code.
* Push your code to a Git repository.
* Is any extra configuration needed? Explore the
xref:../dev_guide/index.adoc#dev-guide-index[Developer Guide] for more options.

Verify::
* You can verify your application in a number of ways. You can push your changes
to your application's Git repository, and use {product-title} to rebuild and redeploy
your application. Alternatively, you can hot deploy using `rsync` to synchronize
your code changes into a running pod.

== Developing Then Deploying on {product-title}

Another possible application life cycle is to develop locally, then use
{product-title} to deploy your fully developed application. Use the
following process if you plan to have application code already, then want to
build and deploy onto an {product-title} installation when completed:

Initial Planning::
* What does your application do?
* What programming language will it be developed in?

Develop::
* Develop your application code using your editor/IDE of choice.
* Build and test your application code locally.
* Push your code to a Git repository.

Access to {product-title}::
* {product-title} should be installed by this point, either by yourself or an
administrator within your organization.

Generate::
* xref:../dev_guide/new_app.adoc#dev-guide-new-app[Create a basic application] using the `new-app`
command. {product-title} generates build and deployment configurations.

Verify::
* Ensure that the application that you have built and deployed in the above
Generate step is successfully running on {product-title}.

Manage::
* Continue to develop your application code until you are happy with the results.
* Rebuild your application in {product-title} to accept any newly pushed code.
* Is any extra configuration needed? Explore the
xref:../dev_guide/index.adoc#dev-guide-index[Developer Guide] for more options.
