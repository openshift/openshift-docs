== Overview

As a PaaS, OpenShift is designed for building and deploying applications.
Depending on how much you want to involve OpenShift in the development process,
you can choose to develop on OpenShift and use it to continuously develop an
application, or you can deploy a fully developed application onto an OpenShift
instance.

== Developing on OpenShift

You can develop your application on OpenShift directly. Use the following
process if you plan to use OpenShift as a method to build and deploy your
application:

Initial Planning::
* What does your application do?
* What programming language will it be developed in?
 
Access to OpenShift::
* OpenShift should be installed by this point, either by yourself or an
administrator within your organization.

Develop::
* Using your editor/IDE of choice, create a basic skeleton of an application. It
should be developed enough to tell OpenShift
link:../dev_guide/new_app.html#language-detection[what kind of application it
is]. 
* Push the code to your Git repository.

Generate::
* link:../dev_guide/new_app.html[Create a basic application] using the `new-app`
command. OpenShift generates build and deployment configurations.

Manage::
* Start developing your application code.
* Ensure your application builds successfully.
* Continue to locally develop and polish your code.
* Push your code to a Git repository.
* Is any extra configuration needed? Explore the
link:../dev_guide/index.html[Developer Guide] for more options.

Verify::
* You can verify your application in a number of ways. You can push your changes
to your application's Git repository, and use OpenShift to rebuild and redeploy
your application. Alternatively, you can hot deploy using `rsync` to synchronize
your code changes into a running pod.

Another possible application life cycle is to develop locally, then use
OpenShift to deploy your fully developed application. Essentially, use the
following process if you plan to have application code already, then want to
build and deploy onto an OpenShift installation when completed:

Initial Planning::
* What does your application do?
* What programming language will it be developed in?

Develop::
* Develop your application code using your editor/IDE of choice.
* Build and test your application code locally.
* Push your code to a Git repository.

Access to OpenShift::
* OpenShift should be installed by this point, either by yourself or an
administrator within your organization.

Generate::
* link:../dev_guide/new_app.html[Create a basic application] using the `new-app`
command. OpenShift generates build and deployment configurations.

Verify::
* Ensure that the application that you have built and deployed in the above
Generate step is successfully running on OpenShift.

Manage::
* Continue to develop your application code until you are happy with the results.
* Rebuild your application in OpenShift to accept any newly pushed code.
* Is any extra configuration needed? Explore the
link:../dev_guide/index.html[Developer Guide] for more options.
