== Overview

Ruby on Rails is a popular web framework written in https://github.com/openshift/mysql/tree/master/5.5[Ruby].
This guide covers using Rails 4 on OpenShift.

[WARNING]
====
We strongly advise going through the whole tutorial to have an overview of all the steps necessary to run
your application on the OpenShift. If you experience a problem try reading through the entire tutorial and then going back to your issue. It can also be useful to review your previous steps to ensure that all the steps were executed correctly.
====

For this guide you will need:

* Basic Ruby/Rails knowledge
* Locally installed version of Ruby 2.0.0+, Rubygems, Bundler
* Basic Git knowledge
* Running instance of OpenShift v3

== Local Workstation Setup

First make sure that an instance of OpenShift is running and is available.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
For
more info on how to get OpenShift up and running check the
link:../../install_config/install/index.html[installation methods].
endif::[]
Also make sure that your link:../../cli_reference/get_started_cli.html[`oc` CLI
client is installed] and the command is accessible from your command shell, so
you can use it to
link:../../cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#basic-setup-and-login[log in]
using your email address and password.

=== Setting Up the Database

Rails applications are almost always used with a database. For the local development we chose the PostgreSQL database. To install it type:

----
$ sudo yum install -y postgresql postgresql-server postgresql-devel
----

Next you need to initialize the database with:

----
$ sudo postgresql-setup initdb
----

This command will create the `/var/lib/pgsql/data` directory, in which the data will be stored.

Start the database by typing:

----
$ sudo systemctl start postgresql.service
----

When the database is running, create your `rails` user:

----
$ sudo -u postgres createuser -s rails
----

Note that the user we created has no password.

== Writing Your Application

If you are starting your Rails application from scratch, you need to install the Rails gem first.

----
$ gem install rails
Successfully installed rails-4.2.0
1 gem installed
----

After you install the Rails gem create a new application, with PostgreSQL as your database:

----
$ rails new rails-app --database=postgresql
----

Then change into your new application directory.

----
$ cd rails-app
----

If you already have an application, make sure the `pg` (postgresql) gem is present in your `Gemfile`. If not
edit your `Gemfile` by adding the gem:

----
gem 'pg'
----

To generate a new `Gemfile.lock` with all your dependencies run:

----
$ bundle install
----

In addition to using the `postgresql` database with the `pg` gem, you'll also need to ensure the `config/database.yml` is using the `postgresql` adapter.

Make sure you updated `default` section in the `config/database.yml` file, so it looks like this:

----
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  pool: 5
  host: localhost
  username: rails
  password:
----

Create your application's development and test databases by using this `rake` command:

----
$ rake db:create
----

This will create `development` and `test` database in your PostgreSQL server.

=== Creating a Welcome Page

Since Rails 4 no longer serves a static `public/index.html` page in production, we need to create a
new root page.

In order to have a custom welcome page we need to do following steps:

* Create a *controller* with an index action
* Create a *view* page for the `welcome` controller `index` action
* Create a *route* that will serve applications root page with the created *controller* and *view*

Rails offers a generator that will do all this necessary steps for you.

----
$ rails generate controller welcome index
----

All the necessary files have been created, now we just need to edit line 2 in `config/routes.rb`
file to look like:

----
root 'welcome#index'
----

Run the rails server to verify the page is available.

----
$ rails server
----

You should see your page by visiting link:http://localhost:3000[http://localhost:3000] in your browser.
If you don't see the page, check the logs that are output to your server to debug.

=== Configuring the Application for OpenShift

In order to have your application communicating with the PostgreSQL database service that will be running in OpenShift, you will need to edit the `default` section in your `config/database.yml` to use link:../../using_images/db_images/postgresql.html#environment-variables[environment variables], which you will define later, upon the database service creation.

The `default` section in your edited `config/database.yml` together with pre-defined variables should look like:

----
<% user = ENV.key?("POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD") ? "root" : ENV["POSTGRESQL_USER"] %>
<% password = ENV.key?("POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD") ? ENV["POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD"] : ENV["POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD"] %>
<% db_service = ENV.fetch("DATABASE_SERVICE_NAME","").upcase %>

default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  # For details on connection pooling, see rails configuration guide
  # http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#database-pooling
  pool: <%= ENV["POSTGRESQL_MAX_CONNECTIONS"] || 5 %>
  username: <%= user %>
  password: <%= password %>
  host: <%= ENV["#{db_service}_SERVICE_HOST"] %>
  port: <%= ENV["#{db_service}_SERVICE_PORT"] %>
  database: <%= ENV["POSTGRESQL_DATABASE"] %>
----

For an example of how the final file should look, see link:https://github.com/openshift/rails-ex[Ruby on Rails example application] link:https://github.com/openshift/rails-ex/blob/master/config/database.yml[config/database.yml].

=== Storing Your Application in Git

OpenShift requires link:http://git-scm.com/[git], if you don't have it installed you will need to install it.

Building an application in OpenShift usually requires that the source code be stored in a link:http://git-scm.com/[git] repository, so you will need to install `git` if you do not already have it.

Make sure you are in your Rails application directory by running the `ls -1` command. The output of the command should look like:

----
$ ls -1
app
bin
config
config.ru
db
Gemfile
Gemfile.lock
lib
log
public
Rakefile
README.rdoc
test
tmp
vendor
----

Now run these commands in your Rails app directory to initialize and commit your code to git:

----
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "initial commit"
----

Once your application is committed you need to push it to a remote repository. For this you would need a link:https://github.com/join[GitHub account], in which you link:https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/[create a new repository].

Set the remote that points to your `git` repository:

----
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:<namespace/repository-name>.git
----

After that, push your application to your remote git repository.

----
$ git push
----

== Deploying Your Application to OpenShift

To deploy your Ruby on Rails application, create a new link:../projects.html[Project] for the application:

----
$ oc new-project rails-app --description="My Rails application" --display-name="Rails Application"
----

After creating the the `rails-app` link:../projects.html[project], you will be automatically switched to the new project namespace.

Deploying your application in OpenShift involves three steps:

* Creating a database link:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services[service] from OpenShift's link:../../using_images/db_images/postgresql.html[PostgreSQL image]
* Creating a frontend link:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services[service] from OpenShift's link:../../using_images/s2i_images/ruby.html[Ruby 2.0 builder image] and your Ruby on Rails source code, which we wire with the database service
* Creating a route for your application.

[[creating-the-database-service]]
=== Creating the Database Service

Your Rails application expects a running database link:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services[service]. For this service use link:http://www.postgresql.org/[PostgeSQL] database link:../../using_images/db_images/postgresql.html[image].

To create the database link:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services[service] you will use the link:../new_app.html[oc new-app] command. To this command you will need to pass some necessary link:../../using_images/db_images/postgresql.html#environment-variables[environment variables] which will be used inside the database container. These link:../../using_images/db_images/postgresql.html#environment-variables[environment variables] are required to set the username, password, and name of the database. You can change the values of these link:../../using_images/db_images/postgresql.html#environment-variables[environment variables] to anything you would like. The variables we are going to be setting are as follows:

* POSTGRESQL_DATABASE
* POSTGRESQL_USER
* POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD

Setting these variables ensures:

* A database exists with the specified name
* A user exists with the specified name
* The user can access the specified database with the specified password

For example:

----
$ oc new-app postgresql -e POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=db_name -e POSTGRESQL_USER=username -e POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=password
----

To also set the password for the database administrator, append to the previous command with:

----
-e POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin_pw
----

To watch the progress of this command:

----
$ oc get pods --watch
----

=== Creating the Frontend Service

To bring your application to OpenShift, you need to specify a repository in which your application lives, using once again the link:../new_app.html[oc new-app] command, in which you will need to specify database related link:../../using_images/db_images/postgresql.html#environment-variables[environment variables] we setup in the link:./ruby_on_rails.html#creating-the-database-service[Creating the Database Service]:

----
$ oc new-app path/to/source/code --name=rails-app -e POSTGRESQL_USER=username -e POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=db_name
----

With this command, OpenShift fetches the source code, sets up the Builder image, link:../builds.html[builds] your application image, and deploys the newly created image together with the specified link:../../using_images/db_images/postgresql.html#environment-variables[environment variables]. The application is named `rails-app`.

You can verify the environment variables have been added by viewing the JSON document of the `rails-app` link:../deployments.html[DeploymentConfig]:

----
$ oc get dc rails-app -o json
----

You should see the following section:

----
env": [
    {
        "name": "POSTGRESQL_USER",
        "value": "username"
    },
    {
        "name": "POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD",
        "value": "password"
    },
    {
        "name": "POSTGRESQL_DATABASE",
        "value": "db_name"
    }
],
----

To check the link:../builds.html[build] process, use the link:../builds.html#accessing-build-logs[build-logs] command:

----
$ oc logs -f build rails-app-1
----

Once the link:../builds.html[build] is complete, you can look at the running link:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#pods[pods] in OpenShift

----
$ oc get pods
----

You should see a line starting with myapp-(#number)-(some hash) and that is your application running in OpenShift.

Before your application will be functional, you need to initialize the database by running the database migration script. There are two ways you can do this:

* Manually from the running frontend container:

First you need to exec into frontend container with link:../../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html#troubleshooting-and-debugging-cli-operations[rsh] command:

  $ oc rsh <FRONTEND_POD_ID>

Run the migration from inside the container:

  $ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:migrate

If you are running your Rails application in a `development` or `test` environment you don't have to specify the `RAILS_ENV` environment variable.

* By adding pre-deployment link:../../dev_guide/deployments.html#lifecycle-hooks[lifecycle hooks] in your template. For example check the link:https://github.com/openshift/rails-ex/blob/master/openshift/templates/rails-postgresql.json#L122-L130[hooks example] in our link:https://github.com/openshift/rails-ex[Rails example] application.

=== Creating a Route for Your Application

To expose a service by giving it an externally-reachable hostname like `www.example.com` use OpenShift link:../routes.html[route]. In your case you need to expose the frontend service by typing:

----
$ oc expose service rails-app --hostname=www.example.com
----

[WARNING]
====
It's the user's responsibility to ensure the hostname they specify resolves into the IP address of the router. For more information, check the OpenShift documentation on:
