== Overview

There are two types of shared memory objects in Linux: System V and POSIX.
The containers in a pod share the IPC namespace of the pod infrastructure container and so are able to share the System V shared memory objects.
This document describes how they can also share POSIX shared memory objects.


== POSIX Shared Memory
POSIX shared memory requires that a tmpfs be mounted at *_/dev/shm_*.
The containers in a pod do not share their mount namespaces so we use volumes to provide the same *_/dev/shm_* into each container in a pod.
The following example shows how to set up POSIX shared memory between two containers.

====
.shared-memory.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: v1
id: hello-openshift
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: hello-openshift
  labels:
    name: hello-openshift
spec:
  volumes:                          <1>
    - name: dshm
      emptyDir:
        medium: Memory
  containers:
    - image: kubernetes/pause
      name: hello-container1
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          hostPort: 6061
      volumeMounts:                 <2>
        - mountPath: /dev/shm
          name: dshm
    - image: kubernetes/pause
      name: hello-container2
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8081
          hostPort: 6062
      volumeMounts:                 <3>
        - mountPath: /dev/shm
          name: dshm
----
<1> specifies the tmpfs volume `dshm`.
<2> enables POSIX shared memory for `hello-container1` via `dshm`.
<3> enables POSIX shared memory for `hello-container2` via `dshm`.

Create the pod using the *_shared-memory.yaml_* file:

----
$ oc create -f shared-memory.yaml
