== Overview

A _scheduled job_ builds on a regular
xref:../dev_guide/jobs.adoc#dev-guide-jobs[job] by allowing you to specifically
schedule how the job should be run. Scheduled jobs are part of the
link:http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/scheduled-jobs[Kubernetes] API, which
can be managed with `oc` commands like other
xref:../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#object-types[object types].

As of {product-title} 3.3.1, Scheduled Jobs is a feature in Technology Preview.

[[creating-a-scheduledjob]]
== Creating a Scheduled Job

A scheduled job configuration consists of the following key parts:

* A schedule specified in link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron[cron format].
* A job template used when creating the next job.
* An optional deadline (in seconds) for starting the job if it misses its
scheduled time for any reason. Missed jobs executions will be counted as failed
ones. If not specified, there is no deadline.
* `*ConcurrencyPolicy*`: An optional concurrency policy, specifying how to treat
concurrent jobs within a scheduled job. Only one of the following concurrent
policies may be specified. If not specified, this defaults to allowing
concurrent executions.
** `Allow` allows Scheduled Jobs to run concurrently.
** `Forbid` forbids concurrent runs, skipping the next run if the previous has not
finished yet.
** `Replace` cancels the currently running job and replaces
it with a new one.
* An optional flag allowing the suspension of a scheduled job. If set to `true`,
all subsequent executions will be suspended.

The following is an example of a `*ScheduledJob*` resource:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: batch/v2alpha1
kind: ScheduledJob
metadata:
  name: pi
spec:
  schedule: */1 * * * ?    <1>
  jobTemplate:             <2>
    spec:
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:          <3>
            parent: "schedjobpi"
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: pi
            image: perl
            command: ["perl",  "-Mbignum=bpi", "-wle", "print bpi(2000)"]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure <4>
----
1. Schedule for the job. In this example, a job will run every minute.
2. Job template. This is similar to the xref:../dev_guide/jobs.adoc#creating-a-job[job example].
3. Sets a label for jobs spawned by this scheduled job. 
4. The restart policy of the pod. This does not apply to the job controller. See xref:../dev_guide/jobs.adoc#creating-a-job-known-issues[Known Issues and Limitations] for details.

You can also create and launch a scheduled job from a single command using `oc run`. The following command creates and launches the same scheduled job as specified in the previous example:

----
$ oc run pi --image=perl --schedule='*/1 * * * ?' \
    --restart=OnFailure --labels parent="schedjobpi" \
    --command -- perl -Mbignum=bpi -wle 'print bpi(2000)'  
----
 
With `oc run`, the `--schedule` option accepts schedules in link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron[cron format]. 

[NOTE]
=====
When creating a scheduled job,  `oc run` only supports the `Never` or `OnFailure` restart policies (`--restart`).
=====

[TIP]
=====
Delete scheduled jobs that you no longer need:
----
$ oc delete scheduledjob/<scheduledjob_name>
----
Doing this prevents them from generating unnecessary artifacts.

[[cleaning-up-after-a-cron-job]]
== Cleaning Up After a Scheduled Job

Scheduled jobs can leave behind artifact resources such as jobs or pods. Check if any remain:

---- 
$ oc get jobs
$ oc get pods
----

All artifacts left over from a job execution use the job name as their prefix. For example, given the scheduled job example:

----
$ oc get jobs
NAME            DESIRED   SUCCESSFUL   AGE
pi-1497848100   1         1            1m
pi-1497848160   1         1            49s

$ oc get pods
NAME                  READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
pi-1497848100-lxs4k   0/1       Completed   0          2m
pi-1497848160-6r0c8   0/1       Completed   0          59s
----

Delete each artifact if you no longer need them. To delete all jobs spawned by a scheduled job, specify the label set during scheduled job creation:

----
$ oc delete jobs -l <label>
----

For example, to delete only the jobs generated by the scheduled job example:

---- 
$ oc delete jobs -l parent=schedjobpi
job "pi-1497848100" deleted
job "pi-1497848160" deleted
----

== Known Issues

[[scheduledjob-known-issues-unable-to-edit]]
=== Unable to Edit a Scheduled Job

There is a link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1378368[known issue]
when invoking `oc edit scheduledjob` due to an error that was already fixed in
the latest version. However, due to significant code changes, this was not
backported.

One possible solution is to use `oc patch` command instead of `oc edit`.

[[scheduledjob-known-issues-change-concurrency]]
=== Unable to Change Concurrency Policy

There is a link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1386463[known issue]
when changing concurrency policy where no new jobs are created after that
operation is run. The issue is still under investigation in the latest version.
