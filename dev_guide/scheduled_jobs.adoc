== Overview

A _scheduled job_ builds on a regular
xref:../dev_guide/jobs.adoc#dev-guide-jobs[job] by allowing you to specifically
schedule how the job should be run. Scheduled jobs are part of the
link:http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/scheduled-jobs[Kubernetes] API, which
can be managed with `oc` commands like other
xref:../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#object-types[object types].

== Creating a Scheduled Job

A scheduled job configuration consists of the following key parts:

* A schedule specified in link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron[cron format].
* A job template used when creating the next job.
* An optional deadline (in seconds) for starting the job if it misses its
scheduled time for any reason. Missed jobs executions will be counted as failed
ones. If not specified, there is no deadline.
* `*ConcurrencyPolicy*`: An optional concurrency policy, specifying how to treat
concurrent jobs within a scheduled job. Only one of the following concurrent
policies may be specified. If not specified, this defaults to allowing
concurrent executions.
** `Allow` allows Scheduled Jobs to run concurrently.
** `Forbid` forbids concurrent runs, skipping the next run if the previous has not
finished yet.
** `Replace` cancels the currently running job and replaces
it with a new one.
* An optional flag allowing the suspension of a scheduled job. If set to `true`,
all subsequent executions will be suspended.

The following is an example of a `*ScheduledJob*` resource:

====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: batch/v2alpha1
kind: ScheduledJob
metadata:
  name: pi
spec:
  schedule: */1 * * * ?    <1>
  jobTemplate:             <2>
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: pi
            image: perl
            command: ["perl",  "-Mbignum=bpi", "-wle", "print bpi(2000)"]
          restartPolicy: Never
----

1. Schedule for the job. In this example, a job will run every minute.
2. Job template. This is similar to the xref:../dev_guide/jobs.adoc#creating-a-job[job example].

== Known Issues

[[scheduledjob-known-issues-unable-to-edit]]
=== Unable to Edit a Scheduled Job

There is a link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1378368[known issue]
when invoking `oc edit scheduledjob` due to an error that was already fixed in
the latest version. However, due to significant code changes, this was not
backported.

One possible solution is to use `oc patch` command instead of `oc edit`.

[[scheduledjob-known-issues-change-concurrency]]
=== Unable to Change Concurrency Policy

There is a link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1386463[known issue]
when changing concurrency policy where no new jobs are created after that
operation is run. The issue is still under investigation in the latest version.
