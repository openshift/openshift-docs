== Overview
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.html[Docker
registries] can be secured to prevent unauthorized parties from accessing
certain images. If you are using OpenShift's integrated Docker registry and are
pulling from image streams located in the same project, then your pod's service
account should already have permissions and no additional action should be
required. If this is not the case, then additional configuration steps are
required.

== Integrated Registry Authentication and Authorization
OpenShift's integrated Docker registry authenticates using the same
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.html#api-authentication[tokens]
as the OpenShift API. To perform a `docker login` against the integrated
registry, you can choose any user name and email, but the password must be a
valid OpenShift token.
In order to pull an image, the authenticated user must have `get` rights on the
requested `imagestreams/layers`. In order to push an image, the authenticated
user must have `update` rights on the requested `imagestreams/layers`.

By default, all service accounts in a project have rights to pull any image in
the same project, and the *builder* service account has rights to push any image
in the same project.

=== Allowing Pods to Reference Images Across Projects
When using the integrated registry, to allow pods in *project-a* to reference
images in *project-b*, a service account in *project-a* must be bound to the
`system:image-puller` role in *project-b*:

----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user \
    system:image-puller system:serviceaccount:project-a:default \
    --namespace=project-b
----

After adding that role, the pods in *project-a* that reference the default
service account will be able to pull images from *project-b*.

To allow access for any service account in *project-a*, use the group:

----
$ oc policy add-role-to-group \
    system:image-puller system:serviceaccounts:project-a \
    --namespace=project-b
----

== Allowing Pods to Reference Images from Other Secured Registries
To pull a secured Docker image that is not from OpenShift's integrated registry,
you must create a *dockercfg* secret and add it to your service account.

If you already have a *_.dockercfg_* file for the secured registry, you can
create a secret from that file by running:

----
$ oc secrets new <pull_secret_name> \
    .dockercfg=<path/to/.dockercfg>
----

If you do not already have a *_.dockercfg_* file for the secured registry, you
can create a secret by running:

----
$ oc secrets new-dockercfg <pull_secret_name> \
    --docker-server=<registry_server> --docker-username=<user_name> \
    --docker-password=<password> --docker-email=<email>
----

To use a secret for pulling images for pods, you must add the secret to your
service account. The name of the service account in this example should match
the name of the service account the pod will use; *default* is the default
service account:

----
$ oc secrets add serviceaccount/default secrets/<pull_secret_name> --for=pull
----

To use a secret for pushing and pulling build images, the secret must be
mountable inside of a pod. You can do this by running:

----
$ oc secrets add serviceaccount/builder secrets/<pull_secret_name>
----
