== Overview

xref:../../using_images/s2i_images/index.adoc#using-images-s2i-images-index[The
Source-to-Image (S2I) tool] injects application source code into a container image
and the final product is a new and ready-to-run container image that incorporates
the builder image and built source code. The S2I tool can be installed on your
local machine without {product-title} from
link:https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image#installation[the repository].

The S2I tool is a very powerful tool to test and verify your application and
images locally before using them on {product-title}.

== Creating a Container Image


. Identify the builder image that is needed for the application. Red Hat offers
multiple builder images for different languages including
link:https://github.com/sclorg?query=s2i[Python, Ruby, Perl,
PHP, and Node.js]. Other images are available from
link:https://github.com/openshift-s2i[the community space].

. S2I can build images from source code in a local file system or from a Git repository. To build a
new container image from the builder image and the source code:
+
----
$ s2i build <source-location> <builder-image-name> <output-image-name>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
`<source-location>` can either be a Git repository URL or a directory to source code in a
local file system.
====

. Test the built image with the Docker daemon:
+
----
$ docker run -d --name <new-name> -p <port-number>:<port-number> <output-image-name>
$ curl localhost:<port-number>
----

. Push the new image to the
xref:../../install_config/registry/accessing_registry.adoc#access-pushing-and-pulling-images[OpenShift
registry].

. Create a new application from the image in the OpenShift registry using the `oc` command:
+
----
$ oc new-app <image-name>
----
