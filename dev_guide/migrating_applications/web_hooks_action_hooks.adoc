== Overview

This topic reviews the differences in webhooks and action hooks between
OpenShift version 2 (v2) and OpenShift version 3 (v3) and how to migrate these
applications into the v3 environment.

== Webhooks

. After creating a `*BuildConfig*` from a GitHub repository, run:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc describe bc/<name-of-your-BuildConfig>
----
+
This will output a webhook GitHub URL that looks like:
+
----
<https://api.starter-us-east-1.openshift.com:443/oapi/v1/namespaces/nsname/buildconfigs/bcname/webhooks/secret/github>.
----

. Cut and paste this URL into GitHub, from the GitHub web console.

. In your GitHub repository, select *Add Webhook* from *Settings -> Webhooks & Services*.

. Paste the URL output (similar to above) into the *Payload URL* field.

. Set the *Content Type* to `application/json`.

. Click *Add webhook*.

You should see a message from GitHub stating that your webhook was successfully
configured.

Now, whenever you push a change to your GitHub repository, a new build will
automatically start, and upon a successful build a new deployment will start.

[NOTE]
====
If you delete or recreate your application, you will have to update the *Payload
URL* field in GitHub with the new `*BuildConfig*` webhook url.

== Action Hooks

In OpenShift version 2 (v2), there are build, deploy, post_deploy, and pre_build
scripts or action_hooks that are located in the *_.openshift/action_hooks_*
directory. While there is no one-to-one mapping of function for these in v3, the
xref:../../dev_guide/migrating_applications/S2I_tool.adoc#dev-guide-s2i-tool[S2I
tool] in v3 does have the option of adding
xref:../../creating_images/s2i.adoc#s2i-scripts[customizable scripts], either in a
designated URL or in the *_.s2i/bin_* directory of your source repository.

OpenShift version 3 (v3) also offers a
xref:../../dev_guide/builds/build_hooks.adoc#dev-guide-build-hooks[post-build hook] for running basic
testing of an image after it is built and before it is pushed to the registry.
xref:../../dev_guide/deployments/deployment_strategies.adoc#lifecycle-hooks[Deployment hooks] are
configured in the deployment configuration.

In v2, action_hooks are commonly used to set up environment variables. In v2,
any environment variables should be passed with:
[source,bash]
----
$ oc new-app <source-url> -e ENV_VAR=env_var
----

or:
[source,bash]
----
$ oc new-app <template-name> -p ENV_VAR=env_var
----

Also, environment variables can be added or changed using:
[source,bash]
----
$ oc set env dc/<name-of-dc>
ENV_VAR1=env_var1 ENV_VAR2=env_var2’
----
