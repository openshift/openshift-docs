== Overview

A horizontal pod autoscaler, defined by a `*HorizontalPodAutoscaler*` object,
specifies how the system should automatically increase or decrease the scale of
a replication controller or deployment configuration, based on metrics collected
from the pods that belong to that replication controller or deployment
configuration.

Horizontal pod autoscaling is supported starting in OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.1.

== Requirements for Using Horizontal Pod Autoscalers

In order to use horizontal pod autoscalers, your cluster administrator must have

metrics].

== Supported Metrics

The following metrics are supported by horizontal pod autoscalers:

== Autoscaling

You can create a horizontal pod autoscaler with the `oc autoscale` command and
specify the minimum and maximum number of pods you want to run, as well as the
CPU utilization your pods should target.

After a horizontal pod autoscaler is created, it begins attempting to query
Heapster for metrics on the pods. It may take one to two minutes before Heapster
obtains the initial metrics.

After metrics are available in Heapster, the horizontal pod autoscaler computes
the ratio of the current metric utilization with the desired metric utilization,
and scales up or down accordingly. The scaling will occur at a regular interval,
but it may take one to two minutes before metrics make their way into Heapster.

For replication controllers, this scaling corresponds directly to the replicas
of the replication controller. For deployment configurations, scaling corresponds
directly to the replica count of the deployment configuration. Note that autoscaling
applies only to the latest deployment in the `Complete` phase.

[[creating-a-hpa]]
== Creating a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

Use the `oc autoscale` command and specify at least the maximum number of pods
you want to run at any given time. You can optionally specify the minimum number
of pods and the average CPU utilization your pods should target, otherwise those
are given default values from the OpenShift server.

For example:

====
----
$ oc autoscale dc/frontend --min 1 --max 10 --cpu-percent=80
deploymentconfig "frontend" autoscaled
----
====

The above example creates a horizontal pod autoscaler with the following
definition:
