== Overview

A horizontal pod autoscaler, defined by a `*HorizontalPodAutoscaler*` object,
specifies how the system should automatically increase or decrease the scale of
a replication controller or deployment configuration, based on metrics collected
from the pods that belong to that replication controller or deployment
configuration.

[NOTE]
====
Horizontal pod autoscaling is supported starting in {product-title} Enterprise 3.1.1.

== Requirements for Using Horizontal Pod Autoscalers

In order to use horizontal pod autoscalers, your cluster administrator must have
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#install-config-cluster-metrics[properly configured cluster
metrics].

[[hpa-supported-metrics]]
== Supported Metrics

The following metrics are supported by horizontal pod autoscalers:

.Metrics

|===

|Metric |Description

|CPU utilization
|Percentage of the xref:../dev_guide/compute_resources.adoc#dev-cpu-requests[requested CPU]

|Memory utilization
|Percentage of the requested memory.

== Autoscaling

You can create a horizontal pod autoscaler with the `oc autoscale` command and
specify the minimum and maximum number of pods you want to run, as well as the
CPU utilization your pods should target.

After a horizontal pod autoscaler is created, it begins attempting to query
Heapster for metrics on the pods. It may take one to two minutes before Heapster
obtains the initial metrics.

After metrics are available in Heapster, the horizontal pod autoscaler computes
the ratio of the current metric utilization with the desired metric utilization,
and scales up or down accordingly. The scaling will occur at a regular interval,
but it may take one to two minutes before metrics make their way into Heapster.

For replication controllers, this scaling corresponds directly to the replicas
of the replication controller. For deployment configurations, scaling corresponds
directly to the replica count of the deployment configuration. Note that autoscaling
applies only to the latest deployment in the `Complete` phase.

{product-title} automatically accounts for resources and prevents unnecessary autoscaling
during resource spikes, such as during start up. Pods in the `unready` state
have `0 CPU` usage when scaling up and the autoscaler ignores the pods when scaling down.
Pods without known metrics have `0% CPU` usage when scaling up and `100% CPU` when scaling down.
This allows for more stability during the HPA decision. To use this feature, you must configure
xref:../dev_guide/application_health.adoc#dev-guide-application-health[readiness
checks] to determine if a new pod is ready for use.

[[creating-a-hpa]]
== Autoscaling for CPU Utilization

Use the `oc autoscale` command and specify at least the maximum number of pods
you want to run at any given time. You can optionally specify the minimum number
of pods and the average CPU utilization your pods should target, otherwise those
are given default values from the {product-title} server.

For example:

----
$ oc autoscale dc/frontend --min 1 --max 10 --cpu-percent=80
deploymentconfig "frontend" autoscaled
----

The above example creates a horizontal pod autoscaler with the following
definition when using version one of the horizontal pod autoscaler:

Alternatively, the `oc autoscale` command creates a horizontal pod autoscaler
with the following definition when using version two of the horizontal pod
autoscaler:

== Autoscaling for Memory Utilization

[IMPORTANT]
====
Autoscaling for Memory Utilization is a Technology Preview feature only.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to
upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide
feedback during the development process.

For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features support scope, see
https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.

Unlike CPU-based autoscaling, memory-based autoscaling requires specifying the
autoscaler using YAML instead of using the `oc autoscale` command. Optionally,
you can specify the minimum number of pods and the average memory utilization
your pods should target as well, otherwise those are given default values from
the {product-title} server.

. Memory-based autoscaling is only available with the `v2alpha1` version of the
autoscaling API. Enable memory-based autoscaling by adding the following to your
cluster's `master-config.yaml` file:
+
[source,bash]
----
...
apiServerArguments:
  runtime-config:
  - apis/autoscaling/v2beta1=true
...
----

. Place the following in a file, such as `hpa.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
----
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: hpa-resource-metrics-memory <1>
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1beta1 <2>
    kind: ReplicationController <3>
    name: hello-hpa-memory <4>
  minReplicas: 1 <5>
  maxReplicas: 10 <6>
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: memory
      targetAverageUtilization: 50 <7>
----
<1> The name of this horizontal pod autoscaler object
<2> The API version of the object to scale
<3> The kind of object to scale
<4> The name of the object to scale
<5> The minimum number of replicas to which to scale down
<6> The maximum number of replicas to which to scale up
<7> The average percentage of the requested memory that each pod should be using

. Then, create the autoscaler from the above file:
+
----
$ oc create -f hpa.yaml
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
For memory-based autoscaling to work, memory usage must increase and decrease
proportionally to the replica count. On average:

* An increase in replica count must lead to an overall decrease in memory
(working set) usage per-pod.
* A decrease in replica count must lead to an overall increase in per-pod memory
usage.

Use the OpenShift web console to check the memory behavior of your application
and ensure that your application meets these requirements before using
memory-based autoscaling.

=== Viewing Horizontal Pod Autoscaler Status Conditions

You can use the status conditions set to determine
whether or not the horizontal pod autoscaler is able to scale and whether or not it is currently restricted
in any way.

The following status conditions are set:

* `AbleToScale` indicates whether the horizontal pod autoscaler is able to fetch and update scales, and
whether any backoff conditions are preventing scaling.
** A `True` condition indicates scaling is allowed.
** A `False` condition indicates scaling is not allowed for the reason specified.
* `ScalingActive` indicates whether the horizontal pod autoscaler is enabled (the replica count of the target is not zero) and
is able to calculate desired scales.
** A `True` condition indicates metrics is working properly.
** A `False` condition generally indicates a problem with fetching metrics.
* `ScalingLimited` indicates that autoscaling is not allowed because a maximum or minimum replica count was reached.
** A `True` condition indicates that you need to raise or lower the minimum or maximum replica count in order to scale.
** A `False` condition indicates that the requested scaling is allowed.

The horizontal pod autoscaler status conditions are only available with the `v2alpha1` version of the
autoscaling API by adding the following to your cluster's `master-config.yaml` file:

[source,yaml]
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  ...
  apiServerArguments:
    runtime-config:
    - apis/autoscaling/v2beta1=true
----

Restart the {product-title} services:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]

# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api atomic-openshift-master-controllers
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
# systemctl restart origin-master-api origin-master-controllers
