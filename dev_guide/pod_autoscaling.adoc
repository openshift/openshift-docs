== Overview

A horizontal pod autoscaler, defined by a `*HorizontalPodAutoscaler*` object,
specifies how the system should automatically increase or decrease the scale of
a replication controller or deployment configuration, based on metrics collected
from the pods that belong to that replication controller or deployment
configuration.

== Requirements for Using Horizontal Pod Autoscalers

In order to use horizontal pod autoscalers, your cluster administrator must have
link:../install_config/cluster_metrics.html[properly configured cluster
metrics].

== Supported Metrics

The following metrics are supported by horizontal pod autoscalers:

.Metrics

|Metric |Description

|CPU Utilization

== Autoscaling

After a horizontal pod autoscaler is created, it begins attempting to query
Heapster for metrics on the pods. It may take one to two minutes before Heapster
obtains the initial metrics.

After metrics are available in Heapster, the horizontal pod autoscaler computes
the ratio of the current metric utilization with the desired metric utilization,
and scales up or down accordingly. The scaling will occur at a regular interval,
but it may take one to two minutes before metrics make their way into Heapster.

For replication controllers, this scaling corresponds directly to the replicas
of the replication controller. For deployment configurations, scaling corresponds
directly to the replica count of the deployment configuration. Note that autoscaling
applies only to the latest deployment in the `Complete` phase.

== Creating a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

To create a horizontal pod autoscaler, first define it in a file. For example:

.Horizontal Pod Autoscaler Object Definition
====
[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
----
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: frontend-scaler <1>
spec:
  scaleRef:
    kind: DeploymentConfig <2>
    name: frontend <3>
    apiVersion: v1 <4>
    subresource: scale
  minReplicas: 1 <5>
  maxReplicas: 10 <6>
  cpuUtilization:
    targetPercentage: 80 <7>
----
<1> The name of this horizontal pod autoscaler object
<2> The kind of object to scale
<3> The name of the object to scale
<4> The API version of the object to scale
<5> The minimum number of replicas to which to scale down
<6> The maximum number of replicas to which to scale up
<7> The percentage of the requested CPU that each pod should ideally be using
====

Save your definition to a file, such as *_scaler.yaml_*, then use the CLI to
create the object:

====
----
$ oc create -f scaler.yaml
