== Overview

When a person uses the {product-title} CLI or web console, their API token
authenticates them to the OpenShift API. However, when a regular user's
credentials are not available, it is common for components to make API calls
independently.
ifdef::openshift-online,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated,openshift-enterprise[]
For example:

* Replication controllers make API calls to create or delete pods.
* Applications inside containers could make API calls for discovery purposes.
* External applications could make API calls for monitoring or integration purposes.
endif::[]

Service accounts provide a flexible way to control API access without sharing a
regular user's credentials.

[[default-service-accounts-and-roles]]
== Default Service Accounts and Roles

Three service accounts are automatically created in every project:

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
|Service Account |Usage

|*builder*
|Used by build pods. It is given the *system:image-builder* role, which allows
pushing images to any image stream in the project using the internal Docker
registry.

|*deployer*
|Used by deployment pods and is given the *system:deployer* role, which allows
viewing and modifying replication controllers and pods in the project.

|*default*
|Used to run all other pods unless they specify a different service account.
|===

All service accounts in a project are given the *system:image-puller* role,
which allows pulling images from any image stream in the project using the
internal Docker registry.

[[managing-allowed-secrets]]
== Managing Allowed Secrets

In addition to providing API credentials, a pod's service account determines
which secrets the pod is allowed to use.

Pods use secrets in two ways:

* image pull secrets, providing credentials used to pull images for the pod's containers
* mountable secrets, injecting the contents of secrets into containers as files

To allow a secret to be used as an image pull secret by a service account's
pods, run:

----
$ oc secrets link --for=pull <serviceaccount-name> <secret-name>
----

To allow a secret to be mounted by a service account's pods, run:

----
$ oc secrets link --for=mount <serviceaccount-name> <secret-name>
----

[NOTE]
====
Limiting secrets to only the service accounts that reference them is disabled by
default. This means that if `serviceAccountConfig.limitSecretReferences` is set
to `false` (the default setting) in the master configuration file, mounting
secrets to a service account's pods with the `--for=mount` option is not
required. However, using the `--for=pull` option to enable using an image pull
secret is required, regardless of the
`serviceAccountConfig.limitSecretReferences` value.
====

This example creates and adds secrets to a service account:

====
----
$ oc create secret generic secret-plans \
    --from-file=plan1.txt \
    --from-file=plan2.txt
secret/secret-plans

$ oc create secret docker-registry my-pull-secret \
    --docker-username=mastermind \
    --docker-password=12345 \
    --docker-email=mastermind@example.com
secret/my-pull-secret

$ oc secrets link robot secret-plans --for=mount

$ oc secrets link robot my-pull-secret --for=pull

$ oc describe serviceaccount robot
Name:               robot
Labels:             <none>
Image pull secrets:	robot-dockercfg-624cx
                   	my-pull-secret

Mountable secrets: 	robot-token-uzkbh
                   	robot-dockercfg-624cx
                   	secret-plans

Tokens:            	robot-token-8bhpp
                   	robot-token-uzkbh

[[using-a-service-accounts-credentials-inside-a-container]]
== Using a Service Account's Credentials Inside a Container

When a pod is created, it specifies a service account (or uses the default
service account), and is allowed to use that service account's API credentials
and referenced secrets.

A file containing an API token for a pod's service account is automatically
mounted at *_/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token_*.

That token can be used to make API calls as the pod's service account. This
example calls the *_users/~_* API to get information about the user identified
by the token:

====
----
$ TOKEN="$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token)"

$ curl --cacert /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt \
    "https://openshift.default.svc.cluster.local/oapi/v1/users/~" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

kind: "User"
apiVersion: "user.openshift.io/v1"
metadata:
  name: "system:serviceaccount:top-secret:robot"
  selflink: "/oapi/v1/users/system:serviceaccount:top-secret:robot"
  creationTimestamp: null
identities: null
groups:
  - "system:serviceaccounts"
  - "system:serviceaccounts:top-secret"
----
====
endif::[]

[[using-a-service-accounts-credentials-externally]]
== Using a Service Account's Credentials Externally

The same token can be distributed to external applications that need to
authenticate to the API.

Use the following syntax to view a service account's API token:

----
$ oc describe secret <secret-name>
----

For example:

====
----
$ oc describe secret robot-token-uzkbh -n top-secret
Name:		robot-token-uzkbh
Labels:		<none>
Annotations:	kubernetes.io/service-account.name=robot,kubernetes.io/service-account.uid=49f19e2e-16c6-11e5-afdc-3c970e4b7ffe

Type:	kubernetes.io/service-account-token

Data

token:	eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...

$ oc login --token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
Logged into "https://server:8443" as "system:serviceaccount:top-secret:robot" using the token provided.

You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    $ oc new-project <projectname>

$ oc whoami
system:serviceaccount:top-secret:robot
