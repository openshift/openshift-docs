== Overview

When a person uses the {product-title} CLI or web console, their API token
authenticates them to the OpenShift API. However, when a regular user's
credentials are not available, it is common for components to make API calls
independently.
ifdef::openshift-online,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated,openshift-enterprise[]
For example:

* Replication controllers make API calls to create or delete pods.
* Applications inside containers could make API calls for discovery purposes.
* External applications could make API calls for monitoring or integration purposes.
endif::[]

Service accounts provide a flexible way to control API access without sharing a
regular user's credentials.

[[dev-sa-user-names-and-groups]]
== User Names and Groups

Every service account has an associated user name that can be granted roles,
just like a regular user. The user name is derived from its project and name:

----
system:serviceaccount:<project>:<name>
----

For example, to add the *view* role to the *robot* service account in the
*top-secret* project:

====
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:top-secret:robot
----
====

Every service account is also a member of two groups:

system:serviceaccounts:: Includes all service accounts in the system.
system:serviceaccounts:<project>:: Includes all service accounts in the specified project.

For example, to allow all service accounts in all projects to view resources in
the *top-secret* project:

====
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-group view system:serviceaccounts -n top-secret
----
====

To allow all service accounts in the *managers* project to edit resources in the
*top-secret* project:

====
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-group edit system:serviceaccounts:managers -n top-secret
----
====

[[default-service-accounts-and-roles]]
== Default Service Accounts and Roles

Three service accounts are automatically created in every project:

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
|Service Account |Usage

|*builder*
|Used by build pods. It is given the *system:image-builder* role, which allows
pushing images to any image stream in the project using the internal Docker
registry.

|*deployer*
|Used by deployment pods and is given the *system:deployer* role, which allows
viewing and modifying replication controllers and pods in the project.

|*default*
|Used to run all other pods unless they specify a different service account.
|===

All service accounts in a project are given the *system:image-puller* role,
which allows pulling images from any image stream in the project using the
internal Docker registry.

[[managing-service-accounts]]
== Managing Service Accounts

Service accounts are API objects that exist within each project. They can be
created or deleted like any other API object.

====
----
$ oc create serviceaccount robot
serviceaccounts/robot
----
====
endif::[]

[[managing-service-account-credentials]]
== Managing Service Account Credentials

As soon as a service account is created, two secrets are automatically added to
it:

* an API token
* credentials for the internal Docker registry

These can be seen by describing the service account:

====
----
$ oc describe serviceaccount robot
Name:               robot
Labels:             <none>
Image pull secrets:    robot-dockercfg-624cx

Mountable secrets:     robot-token-uzkbh
                       robot-dockercfg-624cx

Tokens:                robot-token-8bhpp
                       robot-token-uzkbh
----
====

The system ensures that service accounts always have an API token and internal
Docker registry credentials.

The generated API token and Docker registry credentials do not expire, but they
can be revoked by deleting the secret. When the secret is deleted, a new one is
automatically generated to take its place.

[[managing-allowed-secrets]]
== Managing Allowed Secrets

In addition to providing API credentials, a pod's service account determines
which secrets the pod is allowed to use.

Pods use secrets in two ways:

* image pull secrets, providing credentials used to pull images for the pod's containers
* mountable secrets, injecting the contents of secrets into containers as files

To allow a secret to be used as an image pull secret by a service account's
pods, run:

----
$ oc secrets link --for=pull <serviceaccount-name> <secret-name>
----

To allow a secret to be mounted by a service account's pods, run:

----
$ oc secrets link --for=mount <serviceaccount-name> <secret-name>
----

This example creates and adds secrets to a service account:

====
----
$ oc secrets new secret-plans plan1.txt plan2.txt
secret/secret-plans

$ oc secrets new-dockercfg my-pull-secret \
    --docker-username=mastermind \
    --docker-password=12345 \
    --docker-email=mastermind@example.com
secret/my-pull-secret

$ oc secrets link robot secret-plans --for=mount

$ oc secrets link robot my-pull-secret --for=pull

$ oc describe serviceaccount robot
Name:               robot
Labels:             <none>
Image pull secrets:    robot-dockercfg-624cx
                       my-pull-secret

Mountable secrets:     robot-token-uzkbh
                       robot-dockercfg-624cx
                       secret-plans

Tokens:                robot-token-8bhpp
                       robot-token-uzkbh

[[using-a-service-accounts-credentials-inside-a-container]]
== Using a Service Account's Credentials Inside a Container

When a pod is created, it specifies a service account (or uses the default
service account), and is allowed to use that service account's API credentials
and referenced secrets.

A file containing an API token for a pod's service account is automatically
mounted at *_/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token_*.

That token can be used to make API calls as the pod's service account. This
example calls the *_users/~_* API to get information about the user identified
by the token:

====
----
$ TOKEN="$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token)"

$ curl --cacert /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt \
    "https://openshift.default.svc.cluster.local/oapi/v1/users/~" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

kind: "User"
apiVersion: "v1"
metadata:
  name: "system:serviceaccount:top-secret:robot"
  selflink: "/oapi/v1/users/system:serviceaccount:top-secret:robot"
  creationTimestamp: null
identities: null
groups:
  - "system:serviceaccounts"
  - "system:serviceaccounts:top-secret"
----
====
endif::[]

[[using-a-service-accounts-credentials-externally]]
== Using a Service Account's Credentials Externally

The same token can be distributed to external applications that need to
authenticate to the API.

Use the following syntax to to view a service account's API token:

----
$ oc describe secret <secret-name>
----

For example:

====
----
$ oc describe secret robot-token-uzkbh -n top-secret
Name:        robot-token-uzkbh
Labels:        <none>
Annotations:    kubernetes.io/service-account.name=robot,kubernetes.io/service-account.uid=49f19e2e-16c6-11e5-afdc-3c970e4b7ffe

Type:    kubernetes.io/service-account-token

$ oc login --token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
Logged into "https://server:8443" as "system:serviceaccount:top-secret:robot" using the token provided.
