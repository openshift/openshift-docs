== Overview

An
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[image
stream] comprises any number of
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/containers_and_images.adoc#docker-images[container
images] identified by tags. It presents a single virtual view of related images,
similar to a Docker image repository.

By watching an image stream, builds and deployments can receive notifications
when new images are added or modified and react by performing a build or
deployment, respectively.

There are many ways you can interact with images and set up image streams,
depending on where the images' registries are located, any authentication
requirements around those registries, and how you want your builds and
deployments to behave. The following sections cover a range of these topics.

[[tagging-images]]
== Tagging Images

Before working with {product-title} image streams and their tags, it will help
to first understand image tags in the context of Docker generally.

Container images can have names added to them that make it more intuitive to determine
what they contain, called a _tag_. Using a tag to specify the version of what is contained
in the image is a common use case. If you have an image named *ruby*, you could
have a tag named *2.0* for 2.0 version of Ruby, and another named *latest* to
indicate literally the latest built image in that repository overall.

When interacting directly with images using the `docker` CLI, the `docker tag`
command can add tags, which essentially adds an alias to an image that can
consist of several parts. Those parts can include:

----
<registry_server>/<user_name>/<image_name>:<tag>
----

The `<user_name>` part in the above could also refer to a
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#projects[project] or
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#namespaces[namespace]
if the image is being stored in an {product-title} environment with an internal
registry.

{product-title} provides the `oc tag` command, which is similar to the `docker
tag` command, but operates on image streams instead of directly on images.

[NOTE]
====
See Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7's
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/version-7/getting-started-with-containers/#creating_docker_images[Getting
Started with Containers] documentation for more about tagging images directly
using the `docker` CLI.
====

[[adding-tag]]
=== Adding Tags to Image Streams

Keeping in mind that an image stream in {product-title} comprises zero or more
container images identified by tags, you can add tags to an image stream using the
`oc tag` command:

----
$ oc tag <source> <destination>
----

For example, to configure the *ruby* image's *latest* tag to always refer to the
current image for the tag *2.0*:

====
----
$ oc tag ruby:latest ruby:2.0
----
====

There are different types of tags available. The default behavior uses a
_permanent_ tag, which points to a specific image in time; even when the source
changes, it will not reflect in the destination tag.

A _tracking_ tag means the destination tag's metadata will be imported during
the import. To ensure the destination tag is updated whenever the source tag
changes, use the `--alias=true` flag:

----
$ oc tag --alias=true <source> <destination>
----

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
You can also add the `--scheduled=true` flag to have the destination tag be
refreshed (i.e., re-imported) periodically. The period is xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-config-image-config[configured globally] at
the system level. See xref:importing-tag-and-image-metadata[Importing Tag and Image
Metadata] for more details.
endif::[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Avoid tagging {product-title}-managed images (i.e., those built using an {product-title} instance and pushed to its internal registry). There is a
ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
xref:../install_config/install/docker_registry.adoc#registry-known-issues[known
issue]
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-online,openshift-dedicated,atomic-registry[]
https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/release_notes/ose_3_2_release_notes.adoc#ose-32-known-issues[known issue]
endif::[]
that prevents the registry client from pulling from such a tag.
====

[[tag-removal]]
=== Removing Tags from Image Streams

You can stop tracking a tag by removing the tag. For example, to stop tracking
an existing *latest* tag:

====
----
$ oc tag -d ruby:latest
----
====

However, while the above command removes the tag from the image stream
definition, it does not remove it from the image stream status. The image stream
definition is user-defined, whereas the image stream status reflects the
information the system has from the specification.

To remove a tag completely from an image stream:

====
----
$ oc delete istag/ruby:latest
----
====

[[referencing-images-in-image-streams]]
=== Referencing Images in Image Streams

Images can be referenced in image streams using the following reference types:

- An `*ImageStreamTag*` is used to reference or retrieve an image for a given
image stream and tag. It uses the following convention for its name:
+
----
<image_stream_name>:<tag>
----

- An `*ImageStreamImage*` is used to reference or retrieve an image for a given
image stream and image name. It uses the following convention for its name:
+
----
<image_stream_name>@<id>
----
+
The `<id>` is an immutable identifier for a specific image, also called a
digest.

- A `*DockerImage*` is used to reference or retrieve an image for a given external
registry. It uses standard Docker _pull specification_ for its name, e.g.:
+
----
openshift/ruby-20-centos7:2.0
----
+
[NOTE]
====
When no tag is specified, it is assumed the *latest* tag will be used.
====
+
You can also reference a third-party registry:
+
----
registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7:latest
----
+
Or an image with a digest:
+
----
centos/ruby-22-centos7@sha256:3a335d7d8a452970c5b4054ad7118ff134b3a6b50a2bb6d0c07c746e8986b28e
----

When viewing example image stream definitions, such as the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/image-streams/image-streams-centos7.json[example
CentOS image streams], you may notice they contain definitions of
`*ImageStreamTag*` and references to `*DockerImage*`, but nothing related to
`*ImageStreamImage*`.

This is because the `*ImageStreamImage*` objects are automatically created in
{product-title} whenever you import or tag an image into the image stream. You
should never have to explicitly define an `*ImageStreamImage*` object in any
image stream definition that you use to create image streams.

You can view an image's object definition by retrieving an `*ImageStreamImage*`
definition using the image stream name and ID:

----
$ oc export isimage <image_stream_name>@<id>
----

[NOTE]
====
You can find valid `<id>` values for a given image stream by running:

----
$ oc describe is <image_stream_name>
----
====

For example, from the *ruby* image stream asking for the `*ImageStreamImage*`
with the name and ID of *ruby@3a335d7*:

.Definition of an Image Object Retrieved via ImageStreamImage
====
----
$ oc export isimage ruby@3a335d7

[[image-pull-policy]]
== Image Pull Policy

Each container in a pod has a container image. Once you have created an image and
pushed it to a registry, you can then refer to it in the pod.

When {product-title} creates containers, it uses the container's
`*imagePullPolicy*` to determine if the image should be pulled prior to starting
the container. There are three possible values for `*imagePullPolicy*`:

- `*Always*` - always pull the image.
- `*IfNotPresent*` - only pull the image if it does not already exist on the node.
- `*Never*` - never pull the image.

If a container's `*imagePullPolicy*`
parameter is not specified, {product-title} sets it based on the image's tag:

. If the tag is *latest*, {product-title} defaults `*imagePullPolicy*` to `*Always*`.
. Otherwise, {product-title} defaults `*imagePullPolicy*` to `*IfNotPresent*`.
endif::[]

[[accessing-the-internal-registry]]
== Accessing the Internal Registry

You can access {product-title}'s internal registry directly to push or pull
images. For example, this could be helpful if you wanted to
xref:creating-an-image-stream-by-manually-pushing-an-image[create an image
stream by manually pushing an image], or just to `docker pull` an image
directly.

ifdef::openshift-online[]
{product-title} (Next Gen) Developer Preview gives developers a hands-on preview
of the OpenShift platform in a hosted environment that includes access to an
internal registry located at *_registry.preview.openshift.com_*.
endif::[]

The internal registry authenticates using the same
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.adoc#api-authentication[tokens]
as the {product-title} API. To perform a `docker login` against the internal registry,
you can choose any user name and email, but the password must be a valid
{product-title} token.

To log into the internal registry:

. Log in to {product-title}:
+
----
$ oc login
----

. Get your access token:
+
----
$ oc whoami -t
----

. Log in to the internal registry using the token. You must have *docker*
installed on your system:
+
----
$ docker login -u <user_name> -e <email_address> \
ifdef::atomic-registry,openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
    -p <token_value> <registry_server>:<port>
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-online[]
    -p <token_value> https://registry.preview.openshift.com
endif::[]
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Contact your cluster administrator if you do not know the registry IP or host
name and port to use.
====

In order to pull an image, the authenticated user must have `get` rights on the
requested `imagestreams/layers`. In order to push an image, the authenticated
user must have `update` rights on the requested `imagestreams/layers`.

By default, all service accounts in a project have rights to pull any image in
the same project, and the *builder* service account has rights to push any image
in the same project.

[[using-image-pull-secrets]]
== Using Image Pull Secrets

xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-image-registry[Docker
registries] can be secured to prevent unauthorized parties from accessing
certain images. If you are xref:accessing-the-internal-registry[using {product-title}'s
internal registry] and are pulling from image streams located in the same
project, then your pod's service account should already have the correct
permissions and no additional action should be required.

However, for other scenarios, such as referencing images across {product-title}
projects or from secured registries, then additional configuration steps are
required. The following sections detail these scenarios and their required
steps.

[[allowing-pods-to-reference-images-across-projects]]
=== Allowing Pods to Reference Images Across Projects

When using the internal registry, to allow pods in *project-a* to reference
images in *project-b*, a service account in *project-a* must be bound to the
`system:image-puller` role in *project-b*:

----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user \
    system:image-puller system:serviceaccount:project-a:default \
    --namespace=project-b
----

After adding that role, the pods in *project-a* that reference the default
service account will be able to pull images from *project-b*.

To allow access for any service account in *project-a*, use the group:

----
$ oc policy add-role-to-group \
    system:image-puller system:serviceaccounts:project-a \
    --namespace=project-b
----

[[allowing-pods-to-reference-images-from-other-secured-registries]]
=== Allowing Pods to Reference Images from Other Secured Registries

The *_.dockercfg_* file (or *_$HOME/.docker/config.json_* for newer Docker
clients) is a Docker credentials file that stores your information if you have
previously logged into a secured or insecure registry.

To pull a secured container image that is not from {product-title}'s internal
registry, you must create a _pull secret_ from your Docker credentials and add
it to your service account.

If you already have a *_.dockercfg_* file for
the secured registry, you can create a secret from that file by running:

----
$ oc secrets new <pull_secret_name> .dockercfg=<path/to/.dockercfg>
----

Or if you have a *_$HOME/.docker/config.json_* file:

----
$ oc secrets new <pull_secret_name> .dockerconfigjson=<path/to/.docker/config.json>
----

If you do not already have a Docker credentials file for the secured registry,
you can create a secret by running:

----
$ oc secrets new-dockercfg <pull_secret_name> \
    --docker-server=<registry_server> --docker-username=<user_name> \
    --docker-password=<password> --docker-email=<email>
----

To use a secret for pulling images for pods, you must add the secret to your
service account. The name of the service account in this example should match
the name of the service account the pod will use; *default* is the default
service account:

----
$ oc secrets add serviceaccount/default secrets/<pull_secret_name> --for=pull
----

To use a secret for pushing and pulling build images, the secret must be
mountable inside of a pod. You can do this by running:

----
$ oc secrets add serviceaccount/builder secrets/<pull_secret_name>
----
endif::openshift-origin,openshift-online,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]

[[importing-tag-and-image-metadata]]
== Importing Tag and Image Metadata

An image stream can be configured to import tag and image metadata from an image
repository in an external Docker image registry. You can do this using a few
different methods.

- You can manually import tag and image information with the `oc import-image`
command using the `--from` option:
+
----
$ oc import-image <image_stream_name>[:<tag>] --from=<docker_image_repo> --confirm
----
+
For example:
+
====
----
$ oc import-image my-ruby --from=docker.io/openshift/ruby-20-centos7 --confirm
The import completed successfully.

Name:			my-ruby
Created:		Less than a second ago
Labels:			<none>
Annotations:		openshift.io/image.dockerRepositoryCheck=2016-05-06T20:59:30Z
Docker Pull Spec:	172.30.94.234:5000/demo-project/my-ruby

Tag	Spec					Created			PullSpec							Image
latest	docker.io/openshift/ruby-20-centos7	Less than a second ago	docker.io/openshift/ruby-20-centos7@sha256:772c5bf9b2d1e8...	<same>
----
====
+
You can also add the `--all` flag to import all tags for the image instead of
just *latest*.

-  Like most objects in {product-title}, you can also write and save a JSON or YAML
definition to a file then create the object using the CLI. Set the
`*spec.dockerImageRepository*` field to the Docker pull spec for the image:
+
====
----
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "ImageStream"
metadata:
  name: "my-ruby"
spec:
  dockerImageRepository: "docker.io/openshift/ruby-20-centos7"
----
====
+
Then create the object:
+
----
$ oc create -f <file>
----

When you create an image stream that references an image in an external Docker
registry, {product-title} communicates with the external registry within a short
amount of time to get up to date information about the image.

After the tag and image metadata is synchronized, the image stream object would
look similar to the following:

====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ImageStream
metadata:
  name: my-ruby
  namespace: demo-project
  selflink: /oapi/v1/namespaces/demo-project/imagestreams/my-ruby

          generation: 2
----
====

You can set a tag to query external registries at a scheduled interval to
synchronize tag and image metadata by setting the `--scheduled=true` flag with
the `oc tag` command as mentioned in xref:adding-tag[Adding Tags to Image
Streams].

Alternatively, you can set `*importPolicy.scheduled*` to *true* in the tag's
definition:

====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ImageStream
metadata:
  name: ruby
spec:
  tags:
  - from:
      kind: DockerImage
      name: openshift/ruby-20-centos7
    name: latest
    importPolicy:
      scheduled: true
----
====

[[insecure-registries]]
=== Importing Images from Insecure Registries

An image stream can be configured to import tag and image metadata from insecure
image registries, such as those signed with a self-signed certificate or using
plain HTTP instead of HTTPS.

To configure this, add the `*openshift.io/image.insecureRepository*` annotation
and set it to *true*. This setting bypasses certificate validation when
connecting to the registry:

====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ImageStream
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: ruby
  annotations:
    openshift.io/image.insecureRepository: "true" <1>
  spec:
    dockerImageRepository: my.repo.com:5000/myimage
----
<1> Set the `*openshift.io/image.insecureRepository*` annotation to *true*
====

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
The above definition only affects importing tag and image metadata. For this
image to be used in the cluster (e.g., to be able to do a `docker pull`), each
node must have Docker configured with the `--insecure-registry` flag. See
xref:../install_config/install/prerequisites.adoc#host-preparation[Host
Preparation] for information.
====
endif::[]

Additionally, you can specify a single tag using an insecure repository. To do
so, set `*importPolicy.insecure*` in the tag's definition to *true*:

====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ImageStream
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: ruby
  tags:
  - from:
      kind: DockerImage
      name: my.repo.com:5000/myimage
    name: mytag
    importPolicy:
      insecure: true <1>
----
<1> Set tag *mytag* to use insecure connection to that registry.
====

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-online,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
[[private-registries]]
=== Importing Images from Private Registries

An image stream can be configured to import tag and image metadata from private
image registries, requiring authentication.

To configure this, you need to create a xref:../dev_guide/secrets.adoc#dev-guide-secrets[secret]
which is used to store your credentials.

Create the secret first, before importing the image from the private repository:

----
$ oc secrets new-dockercfg <secret_name> \
    --docker-server=<docker_registry_server> \
    --docker-username=<docker_user> \
    --docker-password=<docker_password> \
    --docker-email=<docker_email>
----

For more options, see:

----
$ oc secrets new-dockercfg --help
----

After the secret is configured, proceed with creating the new image stream or
using the `oc import-image` command. During the import process, {product-title}
will pick up the secrets and provide them to the remote party.

[NOTE]
====
When importing from an insecure registry, the registry URL defined in the secret
must include the `:80` port suffix or the secret will not be used when attempting
to import from the registry.
====

[[importing-images-across-projects]]
=== Importing Images Across Projects

An image stream can be configured to import tag and image metadata from the
internal registry, but from a different project. The recommended method for
this is to use the `oc tag` command as shown in xref:adding-tag[Adding Tags to
Image Streams]:

----
$ oc tag <source_project>/<image_stream>:<tag> <new_image_stream>:<new_tag>
----

Another method is to import the image from the other project manually using the
pull spec:

[WARNING]
====
The following method is strongly discouraged and should be used only if the
former using `oc tag` is insufficient.
====

. First, add the necessary xref:../dev_guide/service_accounts.adoc#dev-guide-service-accounts[policy] to
access the other project:
+
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-group \
    system:image-puller \
    system:serviceaccounts:<destination_project> \
    -n <source_project>
----
+
This allows `<destination_project>` to pull images from `<source_project>`.

. With the policy in place, you can import the image manually:
+
----
$ oc import-image <new_image_stream> --confirm \
    --from=<docker_registry>/<source_project>/<image_stream>
----
endif::[]

=== Creating an Image Stream by Manually Pushing an Image

An image stream can also be automatically created by manually pushing an image
to the internal registry. This is only possible when using an {product-title}
internal registry.

Before performing this procedure, the following must be satisfied:

- The destination project you push to must already exist.
- The user must be authorized to `{get, update} "imagestream/layers"` in that
project. The *system:image-pusher* role can be added to a user to provide these
permissions. If you are a project administrator, then you would also have these
permissions.

To create an image stream by manually pushing an image:

. First, xref:accessing-the-internal-registry[log in to the internal registry].

. Then, tag your image using the appropriate internal registry location. For
example, if you had already pulled the *docker.io/centos:centos7* image locally:
+
====
----
$ docker tag docker.io/centos:centos7 172.30.48.125:5000/test/my-image
----
====

. Finally, push the image to your internal registry. For example:
+
====
----
$ docker push 172.30.48.125:5000/test/my-image
The push refers to a repository [172.30.48.125:5000/test/my-image] (len: 1)

. Verify that the image stream was created:
