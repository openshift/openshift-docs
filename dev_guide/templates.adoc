== Overview
A link:../architecture/core_concepts/templates.html[template] describes
a set of link:../architecture/core_concepts/overview.html[objects]
that can be parameterized and processed to produce a list of objects
for creation by OpenShift. A template can be processed to create
anything you have permission to create within a project, for example
link:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services[services],
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#builds[build
configurations], and
link:../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configurations]. A template may also define a set of
link:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#labels[labels]
to apply to every object defined in the template.

[[creating-resources-from-a-template]]

== Creating Resources from a Template
You can create a list of resources from a template using the CLI or, if a template
has been uploaded to your project or global template library, using the web
console.

Create a template JSON or YAML file (similar to
link:../architecture/core_concepts/templates.html[this example]); then
upload it with the CLI using the following process.

[[uploading-a-template]]

=== Uploading a Template
You can upload a template to your current project's template library by passing
a JSON or YAML file with the following command:

----
$ oc create -f <filename>
----

You can upload a template to a different project using the `-n` option with the
name of the project:

----
$ oc create -f <filename> -n <project>
----

The template is now available to be selected for a configuration using the web
console or the CLI.

[[generating-a-list-of-resources]]

=== Generating a List of Resources
Process the template and return the list of resources to standard output:

----
$ oc process -f <filename>
----

You can also process an uploaded template by calling the `process` command using:

----
$ oc process uploaded-template-name
----

The process command also takes a list of templates you can process to a list of
resources. In that case, every template will be processed and the resulting list
of resources will contain objects from all templates passed to a process command:

----
$ cat <first_template> <second_template> | oc process -f -
----

Alternatively, you can create from a template without uploading it to the
template library by processing the template and creating from the same template
by piping both commands:

----
$ oc process -f <filename.json> | oc create -f -
----

You can override any link:../dev_guide/templates.html#parameters[parameter]
values defined in the file by adding the `-v` option followed by a
comma-separated list of _<name>_=_<value>_ pairs.
A parameter reference may appear in any text field inside the template items.

For example, you can override the *`ADMIN_USERNAME`* and *`MYSQL_DATABASE`*
parameters to create a configuration with customized environment variables:

.Creating list of resources from a template
====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc process -f examples/sample-app/application-template-dockerbuild.json \
    -v ADMIN_USERNAME=root,MYSQL_DATABASE=admin
----

====

The JSON file can either be redirected to a file or applied directly without
uploading the template by piping the process output to the `create` command:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc process -f examples/sample-app/application-template-dockerbuild.json \
    -v ADMIN_USERNAME=root,MYSQL_DATABASE=admin \
    | oc create -f -
----

====

[[using-the-web-console]]

=== Using the Web Console

To create the resources from an link:#uploading-a-template[uploaded template]
using the web console:

1. While in the desired project, click *Add to Project*:
+
====

image::console_create.png["Console Create"]
====

2. Select a template from the list of templates in your project, or provided by
the global template library:
+
====

image::console_select_template.png["Select Template"]
====

3. Modify template parameters in the template creation screen:
+
====

image::create_from_template.png["Create from Template"]
====
+
<1> Template name and description.
<2> Container images included in the template.
<3> Parameters defined by the template. You can edit values for parameters
defined in the template here.
<4> link:#templates-labels[Labels] to assign to all items included in the
template. You can add and edit labels for objects.


[[modifying-an-uploaded-template]]

=== Modifying an Uploaded Template
You can edit a template that has already been uploaded to your project by using
the following command:

----
$ oc edit template <template>
----

[[templates-labels]]

== Labels
link:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#labels[Labels] are
used to manage and organize generated resources, such as pods. The labels
specified in the template are applied to every resource that is generated from
the template.

There is also the ability to add labels in the template from the command line.

----
$ oc process -f <filename> -l name=otherLabel
----

[[parameters]]

== Parameters
The list of parameters that you can override are listed in the
link:../architecture/core_concepts/templates.html#parameters[`*parameters*`
section of the template]. You can list them with the CLI by using the following
command and specifying the file to be used:

----
$ oc process --parameters -f <filename>
----

The following shows the output when listing the parameters for one of the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/sample-app[*_sample-app_*]
templates:

====
----
$ oc process --parameters -f \
    examples/sample-app/application-template-dockerbuild.json
NAME                DESCRIPTION              GENERATOR           VALUE
ADMIN_USERNAME      administrator username   expression          admin[A-Z0-9]{3}
ADMIN_PASSWORD      administrator password   expression          [a-zA-Z0-9]{8}
MYSQL_USER          database username        expression          user[A-Z0-9]{3}
MYSQL_PASSWORD      database password        expression          [a-zA-Z0-9]{8}
MYSQL_DATABASE      database name                                root
----
====

The output identifies several parameters that are generated with a pseudo
regex expression generator when the template is processed.

[[using-the-quickstart-templates]]

== Using the QuickStart Templates
OpenShift provides a number of default QuickStart templates to make it easy to
quickly get started creating a new application for different languages.
Templates are provided for Rails (Ruby), Django (Python), Node.js, CakePHP
(PHP), and Dancer (Perl). Your cluster administrator should have created these
templates in the default *openshift* project so you have access to them. If they
are not available, direct your cluster administrator to the
link:../admin_guide/install/first_steps.html[First Steps] topic.

By default, the templates build using a public source repository on
https://github.com[GitHub] that contains the necessary application code. In
order to be able to modify the source and build your own version of the
application, you must:

. Fork the repository referenced by the template's default
`*SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL*` parameter.
. Override the value of the `*SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL*` parameter when creating
from the template, specifying your fork instead of the default value.

By doing this, the build configuration created by the template will now point to
your fork of the application code, and you can modify the code and rebuild the
application at will.

[NOTE]
====
Some of the QuickStart templates define a database
link:../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configuration]. The configuration they define uses ephemeral storage for the
database content. These templates should be used for demonstration purposes only
as all database data will be lost if the database pod restarts for any reason.
