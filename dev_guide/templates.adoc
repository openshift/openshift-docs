[[overview]]
== Overview
A template describes
a set of xref:../architecture/core_concepts/index.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-index[objects]
that can be parameterized and processed to produce a list of objects
for creation by {product-title}. A template can be processed to create
anything you have permission to create within a project, for example
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[services],
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#builds[build
configurations], and
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configurations]. A template may also define a set of
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[labels]
to apply to every object defined in the template.

You can create a list of objects from a template
xref:creating-from-templates-using-the-cli[using the CLI] or, if a
xref:uploading-a-template[template has been uploaded] to your project or the
global template library,
xref:creating-from-templates-using-the-web-console[using the web console]. For a
curated set of templates, see the
link:https://github.com/openshift/library[OpenShift Image Streams and Templates
library].

[[uploading-a-template]]

== Uploading a Template

If you have a JSON or YAML file that defines a template, for example as seen in
xref:writing-templates-example[this example], you can upload
the template to projects using the CLI. This saves the template to the project
for repeated use by any user with appropriate access to that project.
Instructions on xref:writing-templates[writing your own templates] are provided
later in this topic.

To upload a template to your current project's template library, pass the JSON
or YAML file with the following command:

----
$ oc create -f <filename>
----

You can upload a template to a different project using the `-n` option with the
name of the project:

----
$ oc create -f <filename> -n <project>
----

The template is now available for selection using the web console or the CLI.

[[creating-from-templates-using-the-web-console]]
== Creating from Templates Using the Web Console

See
xref:../dev_guide/application_lifecycle/new_app.adoc#using-the-web-console-na[Creating
an Application Using the Web Console].

[[creating-from-templates-using-the-cli]]

== Creating from Templates Using the CLI

You can use the CLI to process templates and use the configuration that is
generated to create objects.

[[templates-labels]]

=== Labels
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[Labels] are
used to manage and organize generated objects, such as pods. The labels
specified in the template are applied to every object that is generated from
the template.

There is also the ability to add labels in the template from the command line.

----
$ oc process -f <filename> -l name=otherLabel
----

[[templates-parameters]]

=== Parameters
The list of parameters that you can override are listed in the
xref:writing-parameters[`parameters` section of the template]. You can list them
with the CLI by using the following command and specifying the file to be used:

----
$ oc process --parameters -f <filename>
----

Alternatively, if the template is already uploaded:

----
$ oc process --parameters -n <project> <template_name>
----

For example, the following shows the output when listing the parameters for one
of the Quickstart templates in the default *openshift* project:

====
----
$ oc process --parameters -n openshift rails-postgresql-example

====

The output identifies several parameters that are generated with a regular
expression-like generator when the template is processed.

[[generating-a-list-of-objects]]

=== Generating a List of Objects
Using the CLI, you can process a file defining a template to return the list of objects to standard output:

----
$ oc process -f <filename>
----

Alternatively, if the template has already been uploaded to the current project:

----
$ oc process <template_name>
----

You can create objects from a template by processing the template and piping the
output to `oc create`:

----
$ oc process -f <filename> | oc create -f -
----

Alternatively, if the template has already been uploaded to the current project:

----
$ oc process <template> | oc create -f -
----

You can override any
xref:../dev_guide/templates.adoc#templates-parameters[parameter] values defined
in the file by adding the `-p` option for each `<name>=<value>` pair you want
to override. A parameter reference may appear in any text field inside the
template items.

For example, in the following the *`POSTGRESQL_USER`* and *`POSTGRESQL_DATABASE`*
parameters of a template are overridden to output a configuration with
customized environment variables:

.Creating a List of Objects from a Template
====
----
$ oc process -f my-rails-postgresql \
    -p POSTGRESQL_USER=bob \
    -p POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=mydatabase
----
====

The JSON file can either be redirected to a file or applied directly without
uploading the template by piping the processed output to the `oc create`
command:

====
----
$ oc process -f my-rails-postgresql \
    -p POSTGRESQL_USER=bob \
    -p POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=mydatabase \
    | oc create -f -
----
====

If you have large number of parameters, you can store them in a file and then
pass this file to `oc process`:

----
$ cat postgres.env
POSTGRESQL_USER=bob
POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=mydatabase
$ oc process -f my-rails-postgresql --param-file=postgres.env
----

You can also read the environment from standard input by using `"-"` as the
argument to `--param-file`:

----
$ sed s/bob/alice/ postgres.env | oc process -f my-rails-postgresql --param-file=-
----

[[modifying-an-uploaded-template]]

== Modifying an Uploaded Template
You can edit a template that has already been uploaded to your project by using
the following command:

----
$ oc edit template <template>
----

[[using-the-instantapp-templates]]

== Using the Instant App and Quickstart Templates
{product-title} provides a number of default Instant App and Quickstart templates to
make it easy to quickly get started creating a new application for different
languages. Templates are provided for Rails (Ruby), Django (Python), Node.js,
CakePHP (PHP), and Dancer (Perl). Your cluster administrator should have created
these templates in the default, global *openshift* project so you have access to
them. You can list the available default Instant App and Quickstart templates
with:

----
$ oc get templates -n openshift
----

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
If they are not available, direct your cluster administrator to the
xref:../install_config/imagestreams_templates.adoc#install-config-imagestreams-templates[Loading the Default Image Streams and Templates]
topic.
endif::[]

By default, the templates build using a public source repository on
https://github.com[GitHub] that contains the necessary application code. In
order to be able to modify the source and build your own version of the
application, you must:

. Fork the repository referenced by the template's default
`SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL` parameter.
. Override the value of the `SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL` parameter when creating
from the template, specifying your fork instead of the default value.

By doing this, the build configuration created by the template will now point to
your fork of the application code, and you can modify the code and rebuild the
application at will.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
A walkthrough of this process using the web console is
provided in xref:../getting_started/developers_console.adoc#getting-started-developers-console[Getting
Started for Developers: Web Console].
endif::[]

[NOTE]
====
Some of the Instant App and Quickstart templates define a database
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment configuration].
The configuration they define uses ephemeral storage for the database content.
These templates should be used for demonstration purposes only as all database
data will be lost if the database pod restarts for any reason.
====

[[writing-templates]]

== Writing Templates
You can define new templates to make it easy to recreate all the objects of your
application.  The template will define the objects it creates along with some
metadata to guide the creation of those objects.

[[writing-templates-example]]
.A Simple Template Object Definition (YAML)
====

[[writing-description]]

=== Description
The template description informs users what the template does and helps them
find it when searching in the web console. Additional metadata beyond the
template name is optional, but useful to have. In addition to general
descriptive information, the metadata also includes a set of tags. Useful tags
include the name of the language the template is related to (for example,
*java*, *php*, *ruby*, and so on).

<1> The unique name of the template.
<2> A brief, user-friendly name, which can be employed by user interfaces.
<3> A description of the template. Include enough detail that the user will
understand what is being deployed and any caveats they need to know before
deploying. It should also provide links to additional information, such as a
*_README_* file. Newlines can be included to create paragraphs.
<4> Additional template description. This may be displayed by the service
catalog, for example.
<5> Tags to be associated with the template for searching and grouping. Add tags
that will include it into one of the provided catalog categories. Refer to the
`id` and `categoryAliases` in `CATALOG_CATEGORIES` in the console's

xref:../install_config/web_console_customization.adoc#configuring-catalog-categories[customized]
for the whole cluster.
endif::[]
<6> An icon to be displayed with your template in the web console. Choose from
our existing
link:https://rawgit.com/openshift/openshift-logos-icon/master/demo.html[logo icons] when possible. You can also use icons from
link:http://fontawesome.io/icons/[FontAwesome] and link:https://www.patternfly.org/styles/icons/[PatternFly].
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
Alternatively, provide icons through
xref:../install_config/web_console_customization.adoc#loading-custom-scripts-and-stylesheets[CSS
customizations] that can be added to an {product-title} cluster that uses your
template. You must specify an icon class that exists, or it will prevent falling
back to the generic icon.
endif::[]
<7> The name of the person or organization providing the template.
<8> A URL referencing further documentation for the template.
<9> A URL where support can be obtained for the template.
<10> An instructional message that is displayed when this template is
instantiated. This field should inform the user how to use the newly created
resources. Parameter substitution is performed on the message before being
displayed so that generated credentials and other parameters can be included in
the output. Include links to any next-steps documentation that users should
follow.
====

[[writing-labels]]

=== Labels
Templates can include a set of
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[labels]. These
labels will be added to each object created when the template is instantiated.
Defining a label in this way makes it easy for users to find and manage all the
objects created from a particular template.

.Template Object Labels
====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: "Template"
apiVersion: "v1"
...
labels:
  template: "cakephp-mysql-example" <1>
  app: "${NAME}" <2>
----
<1> A label that will be applied to all objects created from this template.
<2> A parameterized label that will also be applied to all objects created from
this template.  Parameter expansion is carried out on both label keys and
values.
====

[[writing-parameters]]

=== Parameters

Parameters allow a value to be supplied by the user or generated when the
template is instantiated. Then, that value is substituted wherever the parameter
is referenced. References can be defined in any field in the objects list field.
This is useful for generating random  passwords or allowing the user to supply a
host name or other user-specific value that is required to customize the
template. Parameters can be referenced in two ways:

* As a string value by placing values in the form *${PARAMETER_NAME}* in any string field in the
template.
* As a json/yaml value by placing values in the form *${{PARAMETER_NAME}}* in place of any
field in the template.

When using the *${PARAMETER_NAME}* syntax, multiple parameter references can be
combined in a single field and the reference can be embedded within fixed data,
such as *"http://{PARAMETER_1}#{$PARAMETER_2}"*. Both parameter values will be
substituted and the resulting value will be a quoted string.

When using the *${{PARAMETER_NAME}}* syntax only a single parameter reference is
allowed and leading/trailing characters are not permitted.  The resulting value
will be unquoted unless, after substitution is performed, the result is not a
valid json object.  If the result is not a valid json value, the resulting value
will be quoted and treated as a standard string.

A single parameter can be referenced multiple times within a template and it can
be referenced using both substitution syntaxes within a single template.

A default value can be provided, which is used if the user does not supply a
different value:

.Setting an Explicit Value as the Default Value
====
[source,yaml]
----
parameters:
  - name: USERNAME
    description: "The user name for Joe"
    value: joe
----
====

Parameter values can also be generated based on rules specified in the parameter
definition:

.Generating a Parameter Value
====
[source,yaml]
----
parameters:
  - name: PASSWORD
    description: "The random user password"
    generate: expression
    from: "[a-zA-Z0-9]{12}"
----
====

In the example above, processing will generate a random password 12
characters long consisting of all upper and lowercase alphabet letters
and numbers.

The syntax available is not a full regular expression syntax. However, you can
use `\w`, `\d`, and `\a` modifiers:

- `[\w]{10}` produces 10 alphabet characters, numbers, and underscores. This
follows the PCRE standard and is equal to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]{10}`.
- `[\d]{10}` produces 10 numbers. This is equal to `[0-9]{10}`.
- `[\a]{10}` produces 10 alphabetical characters. This is equal to
`[a-zA-Z]{10}`.

Here is an example of a full template with parameter definitions and references:

<1> This value will be replaced with the value of the `SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL`
parameter when the template is instantiated.
<2> This value will be replaced with the unquoted value of the `REPLICA_COUNT`
parameter when the template is instantiated.

use complete sentences to follow the console's https://www.patternfly.org/styles/terminology-and-wording/[text standards].
Don't make this a duplicate of the display name.
<6> A default value for the parameter which will be used if the user does not
override the value when instantiating the template. Avoid using default values for things like passwords, instead
use generated parameters in combination with Secrets.
<7> Indicates this parameter is required, meaning the user cannot override it
with an empty value. If the parameter does not provide a default or generated
value, the user must supply a value.
<8> A parameter which has its value generated.
<9> The input to the generator. In this case, the generator will produce a 40
character alphanumeric value including upper and lowercase characters.
<10> Parameters can be included in the template message. This informs the
user about generated values.

[[writing-object-list]]

=== Object List
The main portion of the template is the list of objects which will be created
when the template is instantiated. This can be any
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/index.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-index[valid API object], such as a
`BuildConfig`, `DeploymentConfig`, `Service`, etc. The object will be
created exactly as defined here, with any parameter values substituted in prior
to creation. The definition of these objects can reference parameters defined
earlier.

====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: "Template"
apiVersion: "v1"
metadata:
  name: my-template
objects:
  - kind: "Service" <1>
    apiVersion: "v1"
    metadata:
      name: "cakephp-mysql-example"
      annotations:
        description: "Exposes and load balances the application pods"
    spec:

      selector:
        name: "cakephp-mysql-example"
----
<1> The definition of a `Service` which will be created by this template.
====

[NOTE]
====
If an object definition's metadata includes a fixed `namespace` field value, the
field will be stripped out of the definition during template instantiation. If
the `namespace` field contains a parameter reference, normal parameter
substitution will be performed and the object will be created in whatever
namespace the parameter substitution resolved the value to, assuming the user
has permission to create objects in that namespace.
====

[[writing-marking-templates-as-bindable]]
=== Marking Templates as Bindable

The template service broker advertises one service in its catalog for each
Template object that it is aware of. By default, each of these services is
advertised as being "bindable", meaning an end user is permitted to bind against
the provisioned service.

Template authors can prevent end users from binding against services provisioned
from a given Template by adding the annotation
`template.openshift.io/bindable: "false"` to the Template.

[[writing-exposing-object-fields]]

=== Exposing Object Fields

Template authors can indicate that fields of particular objects in a template
should be exposed. The template service broker recognizes exposed fields on
ConfigMap, Secret, Service and Route objects, and returns the values of the
exposed fields when a user binds a service backed by the broker.

To expose one or more fields of an object, add annotations prefixed by
`template.openshift.io/expose-` or `template.openshift.io/base64-expose-` to
the object in the template.

Each annotation key, with its prefix removed, is passed through to become a key
in a `bind` response.

Each annotation value is a
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/jsonpath/[Kubernetes
JSONPath expression], which is resolved at bind time to indicate the object
field whose value should be returned in the `bind` response.

[NOTE]
====
`Bind` response key/value pairs can be used in other parts of the system as
environment variables. Therefore, it is recommended that every annotation key
with its prefix removed should be a valid environment variable name --
beginning with a character `A-Z`, `a-z`, or `pass:[_]`, and being followed by zero or
more characters `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, or `pass:[_]`.
====

Use the `template.openshift.io/expose-` annotation to return the field value as
a string. This is convenient, although it does not handle arbitrary binary data.
If you want to return binary data, use the
`template.openshift.io/base64-expose-` annotation instead to base64 encode the
data before it is returned.

[NOTE]
====
Unless escaped with a backslash, Kubernetes' JSONPath implementation interprets
characters such as `.`, `@`, and others as metacharacters, regardless of their
position in the expression. Therefore, for example, to refer to a `ConfigMap`
datum named `my.key`, the required JSONPath expression would be
`{.data['my\.key']}`. Depending on how the JSONPath expression is then written in YAML,
an additional backslash might be required, for example `"{.data['my\\.key']}"`.

The following is an example of different objects' fields being exposed:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: Template
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-template
objects:
- kind: ConfigMap
  apiVersion: v1
  metadata:
    name: my-template-config
    annotations:
      template.openshift.io/expose-username: "{.data['my\\.username']}"
  data:
    my.username: foo
- kind: Secret
  apiVersion: v1
  metadata:
    name: my-template-config-secret
    annotations:
      template.openshift.io/base64-expose-password: "{.data['password']}"
  stringData:
    password: bar
- kind: Service
  apiVersion: v1
  metadata:
    name: my-template-service
    annotations:
      template.openshift.io/expose-service_ip_port: "{.spec.clusterIP}:{.spec.ports[?(.name==\"web\")].port}"
  spec:
    ports:
    - name: "web"
      port: 8080
- kind: Route
  apiVersion: v1
  metadata:
    name: my-template-route
    annotations:
      template.openshift.io/expose-uri: "http://{.spec.host}{.spec.path}"
  spec:
    path: mypath
----

An example response to a `bind` operation given the above partial template
follows:

====
[source,json]
----
{
  "credentials": {
    "username": "foo",
    "password": "YmFy",
    "service_ip_port": "172.30.12.34:8080",
    "uri": "http://route-test.router.default.svc.cluster.local/mypath"
  }
}

[[waiting-for-template-readiness]]
=== Waiting for Template Readiness

Template authors can indicate that certain objects within a template
should be waited for before a template instantiation by the service catalog,
Template Service Broker, or TemplateInstance API is considered complete.

To use this feature, mark one or more objects of kind
`Build`, `BuildConfig`, `Deployment`, `DeploymentConfig`, `Job`, or `StatefulSet`
in a template with the following annotation:

----
"template.alpha.openshift.io/wait-for-ready": "true"
----

Template instantiation will not complete until all objects marked with the
annotation report ready. Similarly, if any of the annotated objects report
failed, or if the template fails to become ready within a fixed timeout of one
hour, the template instantiation will fail.

For the purposes of instantiation, readiness and failure of each object kind are
defined as follows:

[cols="1a,2a,2a", options="header"]
|===

| Kind
| Readiness
| Failure

| `Build`
| Object reports phase Complete
| Object reports phase Canceled, Error, or Failed

| `BuildConfig`
| Latest associated Build object reports phase Complete
| Latest associated Build object reports phase Canceled, Error, or Failed

| `Deployment`
| Object reports new ReplicaSet and deployment available (this honors readiness
probes defined on the object)
| Object reports Progressing condition as false

|`DeploymentConfig`
| Object reports new ReplicationController and deployment available (this
honors readiness probes defined on the object)
| Object reports Progressing condition as false

| `Job`
| Object reports completion
| Object reports that one or more failures have occurred

| `StatefulSet`
| Object reports all replicas ready (this honors readiness probes defined on
the object)
| Not applicable
|===

The following is an example template extract, which uses the `wait-for-ready`
annotation. Further examples can be found in the OpenShift quickstart templates.

  name: my-template
objects:
- kind: BuildConfig
  apiVersion: v1
  metadata:

    annotations:
      # wait-for-ready used on BuildConfig ensures that template instantiation
      # will fail immediately if build fails
      template.alpha.openshift.io/wait-for-ready: "true"
  spec:
    ...

[[other-recommendations]]
=== Other Recommendations

* Set xref:compute_resources.adoc#dev-compute-resources[memory, CPU], and
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#pvc-resources[storage]
default sizes to make sure your application is given enough resources to run
smoothly.

* Avoid referencing the `latest` tag from images if that tag is used across major
versions. This may cause running applications to break when new images are
pushed to that tag.

* A good template builds and deploys cleanly without requiring modifications
after the template is deployed.


[[export-as-template]]

=== Creating a Template from Existing Objects
ifdef::openshift-online[]
If you are upgrading from {product-title} Starter to {product-title} Pro, use
`oc export all` to export all of your existing objects. {product-title} Pro does
not support per-object resource migration.
endif::[]

Rather than writing an entire template from scratch, you can export existing
objects from your project in template form, and then modify the template from
there by adding parameters and other customizations. To export objects in a
project in template form, run:

----
$ oc export all --as-template=<template_name> > <template_filename>
----

You can also substitute a particular resource type or multiple resources instead of `all`.
Run `oc export -h` for more examples.

The object types included in `oc export all` are:

- BuildConfig
- Build
- DeploymentConfig
- ImageStream
- Pod
- ReplicationController
- Route
- Service
