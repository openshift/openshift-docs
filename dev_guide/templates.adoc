== Overview
A xref:../architecture/core_concepts/templates.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-templates[template] describes
a set of xref:../architecture/core_concepts/index.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-index[objects]
that can be parameterized and processed to produce a list of objects
for creation by {product-title}. A template can be processed to create
anything you have permission to create within a project, for example
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[services],
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#builds[build
configurations], and
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configurations]. A template may also define a set of
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[labels]
to apply to every object defined in the template.

You can create a list of objects from a template
xref:creating-from-templates-using-the-cli[using the CLI] or, if a
xref:uploading-a-template[template has been uploaded] to your project or the
global template library,
xref:creating-from-templates-using-the-web-console[using the web console].

[[uploading-a-template]]

== Uploading a Template

If you have a JSON or YAML file that defines a template, for example as seen in
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/templates.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-templates[this example], you can upload
the template to projects using the CLI. This saves the template to the project
for repeated use by any user with appropriate access to that project.
Instructions on xref:writing-templates[writing your own templates] are provided
later in this topic.

To upload a template to your current project's template library, pass the JSON
or YAML file with the following command:

----
$ oc create -f <filename>
----

You can upload a template to a different project using the `-n` option with the
name of the project:

----
$ oc create -f <filename> -n <project>
----

The template is now available for selection using the web console or the CLI.

[[creating-from-templates-using-the-web-console]]

== Creating from Templates Using the Web Console

To create the objects from an xref:uploading-a-template[uploaded template]
using the web console:

1. While in the desired project, click *Add to Project*:
+
====

image::console_create.png["Console Create"]
====

2. Select a template from the list of templates in your project, or provided by
the global template library:
+
====

image::console_select_image_or_template.png["Select Template"]
====

3. Modify template parameters in the template creation screen:
+
====

image::create_from_template.png["Create from Template"]
====
+
<1> Template name and description.
<2> Container images included in the template.
<3> Parameters defined by the template. You can edit values for parameters
defined in the template here.
<4> xref:templates-labels[Labels] to assign to all items included in the
template. You can add and edit labels for objects.

[[creating-from-templates-using-the-cli]]

== Creating from Templates Using the CLI

You can use the CLI to process templates and use the configuration that is
generated to create objects.

[[templates-labels]]

=== Labels
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[Labels] are
used to manage and organize generated objects, such as pods. The labels
specified in the template are applied to every object that is generated from
the template.

There is also the ability to add labels in the template from the command line.

----
$ oc process -f <filename> -l name=otherLabel
----

[[templates-parameters]]

=== Parameters
The list of parameters that you can override are listed in the
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/templates.adoc#parameters[`*parameters*`
section of the template]. You can list them with the CLI by using the following
command and specifying the file to be used:

----
$ oc process --parameters -f <filename>
----

Alternatively, if the template is already uploaded:

----
$ oc process --parameters -n <project> <template_name>
----

For example, the following shows the output when listing the parameters for one
of the Quickstart templates in the default *openshift* project:

====
----
$ oc process --parameters -n openshift rails-postgresql-example

The output identifies several parameters that are generated with a regular
expression-like generator when the template is processed.

[[generating-a-list-of-objects]]

=== Generating a List of Objects
Using the CLI, you can process a file defining a template to return the list of objects to standard output:

----
$ oc process -f <filename>
----

Alternatively, if the template has already been uploaded to the current project:

----
$ oc process <template_name>
----

The `process` command also takes a list of templates you can process to a list of
objects. In that case, every template will be processed and the resulting list
of objects will contain objects from all templates passed to a process command:

----
$ cat <first_template> <second_template> | oc process -f -
----

You can create objects from a template by processing the template and piping the
output to `oc create`:

----
$ oc process -f <filename> | oc create -f -
----

Alternatively, if the template has already been uploaded to the current project:

----
$ oc process <template> | oc create -f -
----

You can override any
xref:../dev_guide/templates.adoc#templates-parameters[parameter] values defined
in the file by adding the `-v` option followed by a comma-separated list of
`<name>=<value>` pairs. A parameter reference may appear in any text field
inside the template items.

For example, in the following the *`POSTGRESQL_USER`* and *`POSTGRESQL_DATABASE`*
parameters of a template are overridden to output a configuration with
customized environment variables:

.Creating a List of Objects from a Template
====
----
$ oc process -f my-rails-postgresql \
    -v POSTGRESQL_USER=bob,POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=mydatabase
----
====

The JSON file can either be redirected to a file or applied directly without
uploading the template by piping the processed output to the `oc create`
command:

====
----
$ oc process -f my-rails-postgresql \
    -v POSTGRESQL_USER=bob,POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=mydatabase \
    | oc create -f -
----
====

[[modifying-an-uploaded-template]]

== Modifying an Uploaded Template
You can edit a template that has already been uploaded to your project by using
the following command:

----
$ oc edit template <template>
----

[[using-the-instantapp-templates]]

== Using the Instant App and Quickstart Templates
{product-title} provides a number of default Instant App and Quickstart templates to
make it easy to quickly get started creating a new application for different
languages. Templates are provided for Rails (Ruby), Django (Python), Node.js,
CakePHP (PHP), and Dancer (Perl). Your cluster administrator should have created
these templates in the default, global *openshift* project so you have access to
them. You can list the available default Instant App and Quickstart templates
with:

----
$ oc get templates -n openshift
----

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
If they are not available, direct your cluster administrator to the
xref:../install_config/imagestreams_templates.adoc#install-config-imagestreams-templates[Loading the Default Image Streams and Templates]
topic.
endif::[]

By default, the templates build using a public source repository on
https://github.com[GitHub] that contains the necessary application code. In
order to be able to modify the source and build your own version of the
application, you must:

. Fork the repository referenced by the template's default
`*SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL*` parameter.
. Override the value of the `*SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL*` parameter when creating
from the template, specifying your fork instead of the default value.

By doing this, the build configuration created by the template will now point to
your fork of the application code, and you can modify the code and rebuild the
application at will. A walkthrough of this process using the web console is
provided in xref:../getting_started/developers_console.adoc#getting-started-developers-console[Getting
Started for Developers: Web Console].

[NOTE]
====
Some of the Instant App and Quickstart templates define a database
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment configuration].
The configuration they define uses ephemeral storage for the database content.
These templates should be used for demonstration purposes only as all database
data will be lost if the database pod restarts for any reason.
====

[[writing-templates]]

== Writing Templates
You can define new templates to make it easy to recreate all the objects of your
application.  The template will define the objects it creates along with some
metadata to guide the creation of those objects.

[[writing-description]]

=== Description
The template description covers information that informs users what your
template does and helps them find it when searching in the web console. In
addition to general descriptive information, it includes a set of tags. Useful
tags include the name of the language your template is related to (e.g., *java*,
*php*, *ruby*, etc.). In addition, adding the special tag *instant-app* causes
your template to be displayed in the list of Instant Apps on the template
selection page of the web console.

====
----
kind: "Template"
apiVersion: "v1"
metadata:
  name: "cakephp-mysql-example" <1>
  annotations:
    openshift.io/display-name: "CakePHP MySQL Example" <2>
    description: "An example CakePHP application with a MySQL database" <3>
    tags: "instant-app,php,cakephp,mysql" <4>
    iconClass: "icon-php" <5>
message: "Your admin credentials are ${ADMIN_USERNAME}:${ADMIN_PASSWORD}" <6>
----
<1> The name of the template as it will appear to users.
<2> A user-friendly name, which can be employed by user interfaces.
<3> A description of the template.
<4> Tags to be associated with the template for searching and grouping.
<5> An icon to be displayed with your template in the web console.
<6> An instructional message that is displayed when this template is instantiated.
This field should inform the user how to use the newly created resources.
Parameter substitution is performed on the message before being displayed so
that generated credentials and other parameters can be included in the output.
====

[[writing-labels]]

=== Labels
Templates can include a set of
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[labels]. These
labels will be added to each object created when the template is instantiated.
Defining a label in this way makes it easy for users to find and manage all the
objects created from a particular template.

====
----
kind: "Template"
apiVersion: "v1"
...
labels:
  template: "cakephp-mysql-example" <1>
----
<1> A label that will be applied to all objects created from this template.
====

[[writing-parameters]]

=== Parameters

Parameters allow a value to be supplied by the user or generated when the
template is instantiated. This is useful for generating random passwords or
allowing the user to supply a host name or other user-specific value that is
required to customize the template. Parameters can be referenced by placing
values in the form *"${PARAMETER_NAME}"* in place of any string field in the
template.

====
----
kind: Template
apiVersion: v1
objects:
  - kind: BuildConfig
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: cakephp-mysql-example
      annotations:
        description: Defines how to build the application
    spec:
      source:
        type: Git
        git:
          uri: "${SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL}" <1>
          ref: "${SOURCE_REPOSITORY_REF}"
        contextDir: "${CONTEXT_DIR}"
parameters:
  - name: SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL <2>
    description: The URL of the repository with your application source code <3>
    value: https://github.com/openshift/cakephp-ex.git <4>
    required: true <5>
  - name: GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET
    description: A secret string used to configure the GitHub webhook
    generate: expression <6>
    from: "[a-zA-Z0-9]{40}" <7>
message: "... The GitHub webhook secret is ${GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET} ..." <8>
----
<1> This value will be replaced with the value of the `*SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL*`
parameter when the template is instantiated.
<2> The name of the parameter. This value is displayed to users and used to
reference the parameter within the template.
<3> A description of the parameter.
<4> A default value for the parameter which will be used if the user does not
override the value when instantiating the template.
<5> Indicates this parameter is required, meaning the user cannot override it
with an empty value. If the parameter does not provide a default or generated
value, the user must supply a value.
<6> A parameter which has its value generated via a
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/templates.adoc#parameters[regular
expression-like syntax].
<7> The input to the generator. In this case, the generator will produce a 40
character alphanumeric value including upper and lowercase characters.
<8> Parameters can be included in the template message. This informs the
user about generated values.
====

[[writing-object-list]]

=== Object List
The main portion of the template is the list of objects which will be created
when the template is instantiated. This can be any
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/index.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-index[valid API object], such as a
`*BuildConfig*`, `*DeploymentConfig*`, `*Service*`, etc. The object will be
created exactly as defined here, with any parameter values substituted in prior
to creation. The definition of these objects can reference parameters defined
earlier.

====
----
kind: "Template"
apiVersion: "v1"
objects:
  - kind: "Service" <1>
    apiVersion: "v1"
    metadata:
      name: "cakephp-mysql-example"
      annotations:
        description: "Exposes and load balances the application pods"
    spec:
      ports:
        - name: "web"
          port: 8080
          targetPort: 8080
      selector:
        name: "cakephp-mysql-example"
----
<1> The definition of a `*Service*` which will be created by this template.
====

[NOTE]
====
If an object definition's metadata includes a `*namespace*` field, the field
will be stripped out of the definition during template instantiation. This is
necessary because all objects created during instantiation are placed into the
target namespace, so it would be invalid for the object to declare a different
namespace.
====

[[export-as-template]]

=== Creating a Template from Existing Objects
Rather than writing an entire template from scratch, you can also export
existing objects from your project in template form, and then modify the
template from there by adding parameters and other customizations. To export
objects in a project in template form, run:

----
$ oc export all --as-template=<template_name>
----

You can also substitute a particular resource type or multiple resources instead of `*all*`.
Run `$ oc export -h` for more examples.
