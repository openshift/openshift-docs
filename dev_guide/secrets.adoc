== Overview

The `Secret` object type provides a mechanism to hold sensitive information such
as passwords, OpenShift client config files, `dockercfg` files, private source
repository credentials, etc. Secrets decouple sensitive content from the pods that
use it and can be mounted into containers using a volume plug-in or used by the
system to perform actions on behalf of a pod. This topic discusses important
properties of secrets and provides an overview on how developers can use them.

[[properties-of-secrets]]

== Properties of Secrets
Key properties include:

- Secret data can be referenced independently from its definition.
- Secret data never comes to rest on the node. Volumes are backed by temporary file-storage facilities (tmpfs).
- Secret data can be shared within a namespace.

[[secrets-and-the-pod-lifecycle]]

=== Secrets and the Pod Lifecycle
A secret must be created before the pods that depend on it.

Containers read the secret from the files. If
a secret is expected to be stored in an environment variable, then you
must modify the image to populate the environment variable from the file before
running the main program.

Once a pod is created, its secret volumes do not change, even if the secret
resource is modified. To change the secret used, the original pod must be
deleted, and a new pod (perhaps with an identical PodSpec) must be created. An
exception to this is when a node is rebooted and the secret data must be re-read
from the API server. Updating a secret follows the same workflow as deploying a
new container image. The
link:https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/user-guide/kubectl/kubectl_rolling-update.md[`kubectl
rollingupdate` command] can be used.

The `resourceVersion` value in a secret is not specified when it is referenced.
Therefore, if a secret is updated at the same time as pods are starting,
then the version of the secret will be used for the pod will not be defined.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, it is not possible to check the resource version of a secret object
that was used when a pod was created. It is planned that pods will report this
information, so that a controller could restart ones using a old
`*resourceVersion*`. In the interim, do not update the data of existing secrets,
but create new ones with distinct names.

[[creating-and-using-secrets]]

== Creating and Using Secrets
When creating secrets:

- Create a secret object with secret data
- Create a pod with a volume of type `secret` and a container to mount the volume
- Update the pod's service account to allow the reference to the secret.

[[creating-secrets]]

=== Creating Secrets
To create a secret object, use the following command, where the json file is a
predefined secret:

====
----
$ oc create -f secret.json

[[image-pull-secrets]]

=== Image Pull Secrets
See the link:image_pull_secrets.html[Image Pull Secrets] topic for more
information.

=== Source Clone Secrets
See the link:builds.html#using-private-repositories-for-builds[Using Private Repositories for Builds] topic for more information.

[[restrictions]]

== Restrictions
Secret volume sources are validated to ensure that the specified object
reference points to a `*Secret*` object. Therefore, a secret needs to be created
before the pods that depend on it.

Secret API objects reside in a namespace. They can only be referenced by pods in
that same namespace.

Individual secrets are limited to 1MB in size. This is to discourage the
creation of large secrets that would exhaust apiserver and kubelet memory.
However, creation of a number of smaller secrets could also exhaust memory.

Currently, when mounting a secret, the service account for a pod must have the secret in the list
of mountable secrets. If a template contains a secret definition and pods that consume it, the
pods will be rejected until the service account is updated.

[[secret-data-keys]]

=== Secret Data Keys
Secret keys must be in a DNS subdomain.
