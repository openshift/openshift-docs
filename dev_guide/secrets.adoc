== Overview

The `Secret` object type provides a mechanism to hold sensitive information such
as passwords, {product-title} client config files, `dockercfg` files, private
source repository credentials, etc. Secrets decouple sensitive content from the
pods that use it and can be mounted into containers using a volume plug-in or
used by the system to perform actions on behalf of a pod. This topic discusses
important properties of secrets and provides an overview on how developers can
use them.

.YAML Secret Object Definition
====

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: test-secret
  namespace: my-namespace
data: <1>
  username: "dmFsdWUtMQ0K"
  password: "dmFsdWUtMg0KDQo="
----
<1> The allowable format for the keys in the `data` field must meet the
guidelines in the *DNS_SUBDOMAIN* value in
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/v1.0.0/docs/design/identifiers.md[the
Kubernetes identifiers glossary].
====

[[properties-of-secrets]]
== Properties of Secrets

Key properties include:

- Secret data can be referenced independently from its definition.
- Secret data never comes to rest on the node. Volumes are backed by temporary file-storage facilities (tmpfs).
- Secret data can be shared within a namespace.

[[secrets-and-the-pod-lifecycle]]
=== Secrets and the Pod Lifecycle

A secret must be created before the pods that depend on it.

Containers read the secret from the files. If a secret is expected to be stored
in an environment variable, then you must modify the image to populate the
environment variable from the file before running the main program.

Once a pod is created, its secret volumes do not change, even if the secret
resource is modified. To change the secret used, the original pod must be
deleted, and a new pod (perhaps with an identical PodSpec) must be created. An
exception to this is when a node is rebooted and the secret data must be re-read
from the API server. Updating a secret follows the same workflow as deploying a
new container image. The
link:https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/user-guide/kubectl/kubectl_rolling-update.md[`kubectl
rollingupdate` command] can be used.

The `resourceVersion` value in a secret is not specified when it is referenced.
Therefore, if a secret is updated at the same time as pods are starting, then
the version of the secret will be used for the pod will not be defined.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, it is not possible to check the resource version of a secret object
that was used when a pod was created. It is planned that pods will report this
information, so that a controller could restart ones using a old
`*resourceVersion*`. In the interim, do not update the data of existing secrets,
but create new ones with distinct names.

[[creating-and-using-secrets]]

== Creating and Using Secrets
When creating secrets:

- Create a secret object with secret data
- Create a pod with a volume of type `secret` and a container to mount the volume
- Update the pod's service account to allow the reference to the secret.

[[creating-secrets]]

=== Creating Secrets
To create a secret object, use the following command, where the JSON file is a
predefined secret:

----
$ oc create -f secret.json
----

[[secrets-in-volumes-and-env-vars]]
=== Secrets in Volumes and Environment Variables

See xref:secrets-examples[examples] of YAML files with secret data.

After you xref:creating-secrets[create a secret], you can:

. Create the pod to reference your secret:
+
----
$ oc create -f <your_yaml_file>.yaml
----

. Get the logs:
+
----
$ oc logs secret-example-pod
----

. Delete the pod:
+
----
$ oc delete pod secret-example-pod

[[secrets-restrictions]]
== Restrictions

To use a secret, a pod needs to reference the secret. A secret can be used with
a pod in two ways: either as files in a volume mounted on one or more of its
containers, or used by kubelet when pulling images for the pod.

Volume type secrets write data into the container as a file using the volume
mechanism. *imagePullSecrets* use service accounts for the automatic injection of
the secret into all pods in a namespaces.

When a template contains a secret definition, the only way for the template to
use the provided secret is to ensure that the secret volume sources are
validated and that the specified object reference actually points to an object
of type `*Secret*`. Therefore, a secret needs to be created before any pods that
depend on it. The most effective way to ensure this is to have it get injected
automatically through the use of a service account.

Secret API objects reside in a namespace. They can only be referenced by pods in
that same namespace.

Individual secrets are limited to 1MB in size. This is to discourage the
creation of large secrets that would exhaust apiserver and kubelet memory.
However, creation of a number of smaller secrets could also exhaust memory.

[[secret-data-keys]]

=== Secret Data Keys
Secret keys must be in a DNS subdomain.

|Issue |Resolution
a|A service certificate generation fails with (service's `*service.alpha.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error*`
annotation contains):

----

----
a|The service that generated the ceritiface no longer exists (has different

`*service.alpha.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error*`,
`*service.alpha.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error-num*`:
