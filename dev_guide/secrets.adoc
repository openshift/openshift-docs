[[dev-guide-secrets-using-secrets]]
== Using Secrets

This topic discusses important properties of secrets and provides an overview on
how developers can use them.

The `Secret` object type provides a mechanism to hold sensitive information such
as passwords, {product-title} client configuration files, `dockercfg` files,
private source repository credentials, and so on. Secrets decouple sensitive
content from the pods. You can mount secrets into containers using a volume
plug-in or the system can use secrets to perform actions on behalf of a pod.

.YAML Secret Object Definition
====

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: test-secret
  namespace: my-namespace
data: <1>
  username: dmFsdWUtMQ0K <2>
  password: dmFsdWUtMg0KDQo=
stringData: <3>
  hostname: myapp.mydomain.com <4>
----
<1> The allowable format for the keys in the `data` field must meet the
guidelines in the *DNS_SUBDOMAIN* value in
link:https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/v1.0.0/docs/design/identifiers.md[the
Kubernetes identifiers glossary].
<2> The value associated with keys in the the `*data*` map must be base64 encoded.
<3> Entries in the `*stringData*` map will have their values converted to base64
and the entry will then be moved to the `*data*` map automatically. This field
is write-only; the value will only be returned via the `*data*` field.
<4> The value associated with keys in the the `*stringData*` map is made up of
plain text strings.

[[properties-of-secrets]]
=== Properties of Secrets

Key properties include:

- Secret data can be referenced independently from its definition.
- Secret data volumes are backed by temporary file-storage facilities (tmpfs) and never come to rest on a node.
- Secret data can be shared within a namespace.


[[creating-secrets]]
=== Creating Secrets

You must create a secret before creating the pods that depend on that secret.

When creating secrets:

- Create a secret object with secret data.
- Update the pod's service account to allow the reference to the secret.
- Create a pod, which consumes the secret as an environment variable or as a file
(using a `secret` volume).

You can use the create command to create a secret object from a JSON or YAML file:

====
----
$ oc create -f <filename>
----
====

[[secrets-and-the-pod-lifecycle]]
=== Updating Secrets

When you modify the value of a secret, the value (used by an already running
pod) will not dynamically change. To change a secret, you must delete the
original pod and create a new pod (perhaps with an identical PodSpec).

Updating a secret follows the same workflow as deploying a new container image.
You can use the `kubectl rolling-update` command.

The `resourceVersion` value in a secret is not specified when it is referenced.
Therefore, if a secret is updated at the same time as pods are starting, then
the version of the secret will be used for the pod will not be defined.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, it is not possible to check the resource version of a secret object
that was used when a pod was created. It is planned that pods will report this
information, so that a controller could restart ones using a old
`*resourceVersion*`. In the interim, do not update the data of existing secrets,
but create new ones with distinct names.

See xref:secrets-examples[examples] of YAML files with secret data.

After you xref:creating-secrets[create a secret], you can:

. Create the pod to reference your secret:

$ oc create -f <your_yaml_file>.yaml

. Get the logs:

----
$ oc logs secret-example-pod
----

. Delete the pod:

[[service-serving-certificate-secrets]]
== Service Serving Certificate Secrets

Service serving certificate secrets are intended to support complex middleware
applications that need out-of-the-box certificates. It has the same settings as
the server certificates generated by the administrator tooling for nodes and
masters.

To secure communication to your service, have the cluster generate a signed
serving certificate/key pair into a secret in your namespace. To do this, set
the `service.alpha.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name` to the name you want
to use for your secret. Then, your *PodSpec* can mount that secret. When it is
available, your pod will run. The certificate will be good for the internal
service DNS name, `*<service.name>.<service.namespace>.svc*`. The certificate
and key are in PEM format, stored in `*tls.crt*` and `*tls.key*` respectively.
They are regenerated upon expiration. View the expiration date in the
`*service.alpha.openshift.io/expiry*` annotation on the secret, which is in
RFC3339 format.

Other pods can trust cluster-created certificates (which are only signed for
internal DNS names), by using the CA bundle in the
*_/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-ca.crt_* file that is
automatically mounted in their pod.

The signature algorithm for this feature is `x509.SHA256WithRSA`. To manually
rotate, delete the generated secret. A new certificate is created.

[[secrets-restrictions]]
== Restrictions

To use a secret, a pod needs to reference the secret. A secret can be used with
a pod in three ways:

- to populate environment variables for containers.
- as files in a volume mounted on one or more of its containers.
- by kubelet when pulling images for the pod.

Volume type secrets write data into the container as a file using the volume
mechanism. *imagePullSecrets* use service accounts for the automatic injection of
the secret into all pods in a namespaces.

When a template contains a secret definition, the only way for the template to
use the provided secret is to ensure that the secret volume sources are
validated and that the specified object reference actually points to an object
of type `*Secret*`. Therefore, a secret needs to be created before any pods that
depend on it. The most effective way to ensure this is to have it get injected
automatically through the use of a service account.

Secret API objects reside in a namespace. They can only be referenced by pods in
that same namespace.

Individual secrets are limited to 1MB in size. This is to discourage the
creation of large secrets that would exhaust apiserver and kubelet memory.
However, creation of a number of smaller secrets could also exhaust memory.

[[secret-data-keys]]

=== Secret Data Keys
Secret keys must be in a DNS subdomain.
