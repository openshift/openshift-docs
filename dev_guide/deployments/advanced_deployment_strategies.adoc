== Advanced Deployment Strategies

xref:../../dev_guide/deployments/deployment_strategies.adoc#strategies[Deployment strategies] provide a way
for the application to evolve. Some strategies use the
xref:../../dev_guide/deployments/deployment_strategies.adoc#strategies[deployment configuration] to make
changes that are seen by users of all routes that resolve to the application.
Other strategies, such as the ones described here, use router features to impact
specific routes.

involve running two versions of an application at the same time and moving
traffic from the in-production version (the green version) to the newer version
(the blue version). You can use a
xref:../../dev_guide/deployments/deployment_strategies.adoc#rolling-strategy[rolling
strategy] or switch services in a route.

[NOTE]
====
Since many applications depend on persistent data, you will need to have an
application that supports xref:n1-compatibility[N-1 compatibility], which means
you share data and implement live migration between your database, store, or
disk by creating two copies of your data layer.

Consider the data used in testing the new version. If it is the production data,
a bug in the new version can break the production version.

[[advanced-deployment-strategies-blue-green-deployments-example]]
=== Using a Blue-Green Deployment

Blue-Green deployments use two deployment configurations. Both are running, and
the one in production depends on the service the route specifies, with each
deployment configuration exposed to a different service. You can create a new
route to the new version and test it. When ready, change the service in the
production route to point to the new service and the new, blue, version is live.

If necessary, you can roll back to the older, green, version by switching
service back to the previous version.

[discrete]
[[advanced-deployment-strategies-using-a-route-and-two-services]]
==== Using a Route and Two Services

This example sets up two deployment configurations; one for the stable version
(the green version) and the other for the newer version (the blue version).

A route points to a service, and can be changed to point to a different service
at any time. As a developer, you can test the new version of your code by
connecting to the new service before your production traffic is routed to it.

Routes are intended for web (HTTP and HTTPS) traffic, so this technique is best
suited for web applications.

. Create two copies of the example application:
+
----
$ oc new-app openshift/deployment-example:v1 --name=example-green
$ oc new-app openshift/deployment-example:v2 --name=example-blue
----
+
This creates two independent application components: one running the *v1*
image under the `example-green` service, and one using the *v2* image under the
`example-blue` service.

. Create a route that points to the old service:
+
----
$ oc expose svc/example-green --name=bluegreen-example
----

. Browse to the application at `bluegreen-example.<project>.<router_domain>` to
verify you see the *v1* image.
+

endif::[]

. Edit the route and change the service name to `example-blue`:
+
----
$ oc patch route/bluegreen-example -p '{"spec":{"to":{"name":"example-blue"}}}'
----

. To verify that the route has changed, refresh the browser until you see the *v2* image.


[[advanced-deployment-a-b-deployment]]
== A/B Deployment

The A/B xref:../../dev_guide/deployments/deployment_strategies.adoc#strategies[deployment strategy] lets you
try a new version of the application in a limited way in the production
environment. You can specify that the production version gets most of the user
requests while a limited fraction of requests go to the new version. Since you
control the portion of requests to each version, as testing progresses you can
increase the fraction of requests to the new version and ultimately stop using
the previous version. As you adjust the request load on each version, the number
of pods in each service may need to be scaled as well to provide the expected
performance.

In addition to upgrading software, you can use this feature to experiment with
versions of the user interface. Since some users get the old version and some
the new, you can evaluate the user's reaction to the different versions to
inform design decisions.

For this to be effective, both the old and new versions need to be similar
enough that both can run at the same time. This is common with bug fix releases
and when new features do not interfere with the old. The versions need
xref:n1-compatibility[N-1 compatibility] to properly work together.

{product-title} supports N-1 compatibility through the web console as well as
the command line interface.

[[routes-load-balancing-for-AB-testing]]
=== Load Balancing for A/B Testing

The user sets up a xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#alternateBackends[route with multiple services].
Each service handles a version of the application.

Each service is assigned a `*weight*` and the portion of requests to each
service is the `*service_weight*` divided by the `*sum_of_weights*`. The
`*weight*` for each service is distributed to the service's endpoints so that
the sum of the endpoint `*weights*` is the service `*weight*`.

The route can have up to four services. The `*weight*` for the service can be
between `0` and `256`. When the `*weight*` is `0`, no new requests go to the
service, however existing connections remain active. When the service `*weight*`
is not `0`, each endpoint has a minimum `*weight*` of `1`. Because of this, a
service with a lot of endpoints can end up with higher `*weight*` than desired.
In this case, reduce the number of pods to get the desired load balance
`*weight*`. See the
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#alternateBackends[Alternate
Backends and Weights] section for more information.

The web console allows users to set the weighting and show balance between them:

image::weighting.png[Visualization of Alternate Back Ends in the Web Console]


To set up the A/B environment:

. Create the two applications and give them different names. Each creates a
deployment configuration. The applications are versions of the same program; one
is usually the current production version and the other the proposed new
version:
+
----
$ oc new-app openshift/deployment-example1 --name=ab-example-a
$ oc new-app openshift/deployment-example2 --name=ab-example-b
----

. Expose the deployment configuration to create a service:
+
----
$ oc expose dc/ab-example-a --name=ab-example-A
$ oc expose dc/ab-example-b --name=ab-example-B
----
+
At this point both applications are deployed and are running and have services.

. Make the application available externally via a route. You can expose either
service at this point, it may be convenient to expose the current production
version and latter modify the route to add the new version.
+
----
$ oc expose svc/ab-example-A
----
+
Browse to the application at `ab-example.<project>.<router_domain>` to verify
that you see the desired version.

. When you deploy the route, the router will
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#alternateBackends[balance the traffic]
according to the `*weights*` specified for the services. At this point there is a single
service with default `*weight=1*` so all requests go to it. Adding the other service as
an `*alternateBackends*` and adjusting the `*weights*` will bring the A/B setup to life.
This can be done by the `oc set route-backends` command or by editing the route.
+
[NOTE]
====
Changes to the route just change the portion of traffic to the various services.
You may need to scale the deployment configurations to adjust the number of pods
to handle the anticipated loads.
====
+
To edit the route, run:
+
----
$ oc edit route <route-name>
...
metadata:
  name: route-alternate-service
  annotations:
    haproxy.router.openshift.io/balance: roundrobin
spec:
  host: ab-example.my-project.my-domain
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: ab-example-A
    weight: 10
  alternateBackends:
  - kind: Service
    name: ab-example-B
    weight: 15
...
----


[[oc-set-route-backends]]
==== Managing Weights

This command manages the services and corresponding `*weights*`
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#alternateBackends[load balanced] by the route.

----
  oc set route-backends ROUTENAME [--zero|--equal] [--adjust] SERVICE=WEIGHT[%] [...] [options]
----

For example, the following sets `*ab-example-A*` as the primary service with
`*weight=198*` and `*ab-example-B*` as the first alternate service with a
`*weight=2*`:

----
$ oc set route-backends web ab-example-A=198 ab-example-B=2
----

This means 99% of traffic will be sent to service `*ab-example-A*` and 1% to
service `*ab-example-B*`.

This command does not scale the deployment configurations. You may need to do
that to have enough pods to handle the request load.

The command with no flags displays the current configuration.

----
$ oc set route-backends web
NAME                    KIND     TO           WEIGHT
routes/web              Service  ab-example-A 198 (99%)
routes/web              Service  ab-example-B 2   (1%)
----

The `*--adjust*` flag allows you to alter the weight of an individual
service relative to itself or to the primary service.  Specifying a
percentage will adjust the service relative to either the primary or
the first alternate (if you specify the primary). If there are other
backends their weights will be kept proportional to the changed.

----
$ oc set route-backends web --adjust ab-example-A=200 ab-example-B=10
$ oc set route-backends web --adjust ab-example-B=5%
$ oc set route-backends web --adjust ab-example-B=+15%
----

The `*--equal*` flag sets the `*weight*` of all services to 100

----
$ oc set route-backends web --equal
----

The `*--zero*` flag sets the `*weight*` of all services to 0. All
requests will return with a 503 error.

[NOTE]
====
Not all routers may support multiple or weighted backends.
====


[[advanced-deployment-one-service-multiple-deployment-configs]]
==== One Service, Multiple Deployment Configurations

If you have the router installed, make the application available via a route (or
use the service IP directly):

----
$ oc expose svc/ab-example
----

Browse to the application at `ab-example.<project>.<router_domain>` to verify
you see the *v1* image.

. Create a second shard based on the same source image as the first shard but
different tagged version, and set a unique value:
+
----
$ oc new-app openshift/deployment-example:v2 --name=ab-example-b --labels=ab-example=true SUBTITLE="shard B" COLOR="red"
----

. Edit the newly created shard to set a label `ab-example=true` that will be
common to all shards:
+
----
$ oc edit dc/ab-example-b
----
+
In the editor, add the line `ab-example: "true"` underneath `spec.selector` and
`spec.template.metadata.labels` alongside the existing
`deploymentconfig=ab-example-b` label. Save and exit the editor.

. Trigger a re-deployment of the second shard to pick up the new labels:
+
----
$ oc deploy ab-example-b --latest
----

. At this point, both sets of pods are being served under the route. However,
since both browsers (by leaving a connection open) and the router (by default,
through a cookie) will attempt to preserve your connection to a back-end server,
you may not see both shards being returned to you. To force your browser to one
or the other shard, use the scale command:
+
----
$ oc scale dc/ab-example-a --replicas=0
----
+
Refreshing your browser should show *v2* and *shard B* (in red).
+
----
$ oc scale dc/ab-example-a --replicas=1; oc scale dc/ab-example-b --replicas=0
----
+
Refreshing your browser should show *v1* and *shard A* (in blue).
+
If you trigger a deployment on either shard, only the pods in that shard will be
affected. You can easily trigger a deployment by changing the `SUBTITLE`
environment variable in either deployment config `oc edit dc/ab-example-a` or
`oc edit dc/ab-example-b`. You can add additional shards by repeating steps 5-7.
+
[NOTE]
====
These steps will be simplified in future versions of {product-title}.
====

[[proxy-shard-traffic-splitter]]
== Proxy Shard / Traffic Splitter

In production environments, you can precisely control the distribution
of traffic that lands on a particular shard. When dealing with large numbers of
instances, you can use the relative scale of individual shards to implement
percentage based traffic. That combines well with a *proxy shard*, which
forwards or splits the traffic it receives to a separate service or application
running elsewhere.

In the simplest configuration, the proxy would forward requests unchanged. In
more complex setups, you can duplicate the incoming requests and send to
both a separate cluster as well as to a local instance of the application, and
compare the result. Other patterns include keeping the caches of a DR
installation warm, or sampling incoming traffic for analysis purposes.

While an implementation is beyond the scope of this example, any TCP (or UDP)
proxy could be run under the desired shard. Use the `oc scale` command to alter
the relative number of instances serving requests under the proxy shard. For
more complex traffic management, consider customizing the {product-title} router
with proportional balancing capabilities.

[[n1-compatibility]]
== N-1 Compatibility

Applications that have new code and old code running at the same time must be
careful to ensure that data written by the new code can be read and handled
(or gracefully ignored) by the old version of the code.
This is sometimes called _schema evolution_ and is a complex problem.

This can take many forms -- data stored on disk, in a database, in a temporary
cache, or that is part of a user's browser session. While most web applications
can support rolling deployments, it is important to test and design your
application to handle it.

For some applications, the period of time that old code and new code is running
side by side is short, so bugs or some failed user transactions are
acceptable. For others, the failure pattern may result in the entire application
becoming non-functional.

One way to validate N-1 compatibility is to use an xref:advanced-deployment-a-b-deployment[A/B deployment].
Run the old code and new code at the same time in a controlled way in a test environment,
and verify that traffic that flows to the new deployment does not cause failures
in the old deployment.

[[graceful-termination]]
== Graceful Termination

{product-title} and Kubernetes give application instances time to shut down
before removing them from load balancing rotations. However, applications must
ensure they cleanly terminate user connections as well before they exit.

On shutdown, {product-title} will send a *TERM* signal to the processes in the
container. Application code, on receiving *SIGTERM*, should stop accepting new
connections. This will ensure that load balancers route traffic to other active
instances. The application code should then wait until all open connections are
closed (or gracefully terminate individual connections at the next opportunity)
before exiting.

After the graceful termination period expires, a process that has not exited
will be sent the *KILL* signal, which immediately ends the process. The
`terminationGracePeriodSeconds` attribute of a pod or pod template controls
the graceful termination period (default 30 seconds) and may be customized per
application as necessary.
