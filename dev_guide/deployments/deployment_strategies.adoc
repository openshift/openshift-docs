== What Are Deployment Strategies?

This is a test build!

A deployment strategy is a way to change or upgrade an application. The aim
is to make the change without downtime in a way that the user barely notices the
improvements.

The most common strategy is to use a
xref:../../dev_guide/deployments/advanced_deployment_strategies.adoc#advanced-deployment-strategies-blue-green-deployments[blue-green
deployment]. The new version (the blue version) is brought up for testing and
evaluation, while the users still use the stable version (the green version).
When ready, the users are switched to the blue version. If a problem arises, you
can switch back to the green version.

A common alternative strategy is to use A/B versions that are both active at the
same time and some users use one version, and some users use the other version.
This can be used for experimenting with user interface changes and other
features to get user feedback. It can also be used to verify proper operation in
a production context where problems impact a limited number of users.

A canary deployment tests the new version but when a problem is detected it
quickly falls back to the previous version. This can be done with both of the
above strategies.

The route based deployment strategies do not scale the number of pods in the
services. To maintain desired performance characteristics the deployment
configurations may need to be scaled.

There are things to consider when choosing a deployment strategy.

- Long running connections need to be handled gracefully.

- Database conversions can get tricky and will need to be done and rolled
back along with the application.

- If the application is a hybrid of microservices and traditional components
downtime may be needed to complete the transition.

- You need the infrastructure to do this.

- If you have a non-isolated test environment, you can break both new and old versions.


Since the end user usually accesses the application through a route handled by a
router, the deployment strategy can focus on deployment configuration features
or routing features.

Strategies that focus on the deployment configuration impact all routes that use
the application. Strategies that use router features target individual routes.

Many deployment strategies are supported through the deployment configuration
and some additional strategies are supported through router features. The
deployment configuration-based strategies are discussed in this section.

The xref:rolling-strategy[Rolling strategy] is the default strategy used if
no strategy is specified on a deployment configuration.

A deployment strategy uses
xref:../../dev_guide/application_health.adoc#dev-guide-application-health[readiness
checks] to determine if a new pod is ready for use. If a readiness check fails,
the deployment configuration will retry to run the pod until it times out. The
default timeout is `10m`, a value set in `TimeoutSeconds` in
`dc.spec.strategy.*params`.

[[rolling-strategy]]
== Rolling Strategy

A rolling deployment slowly replaces instances of the previous version of an
application with instances of the new version of the application. A rolling
deployment typically waits for new pods to become *ready* via a *readiness
check* before scaling down the old components. If a significant issue occurs,
the rolling deployment can be aborted.

[[canary-deployments]]
=== Canary Deployments

All rolling deployments in {product-title} are _canary_ deployments; a new
version (the canary) is tested  before all of the old instances are replaced. If
the readiness check never succeeds, the canary instance is removed and the
deployment configuration will be automatically rolled back. The readiness check
is part of the application code, and may be as sophisticated as necessary to
ensure the new instance is ready to be used. If you need to implement more
complex checks of the application (such as sending real user workloads to the
new instance), consider implementing a custom deployment or using a
xref:../../dev_guide/deployments/advanced_deployment_strategies.adoc#dev-guide-advanced-deployment-strategies[blue-green] deployment strategy.

[[when-to-use-a-rolling-deployment]]
=== When to Use a Rolling Deployment

* When you want to take no downtime during an application update.
* When your application supports having old code and new code running at the same time.

A rolling deployment means you to have both old and new versions of your code
running at the same time. This typically requires that your application handle
xref:../../dev_guide/deployments/advanced_deployment_strategies.adoc#n1-compatibility[N-1 compatibility].

The following is an example of the Rolling strategy:

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: Rolling
  rollingParams:
    updatePeriodSeconds: 1 <1>
    intervalSeconds: 1 <2>
    timeoutSeconds: 120 <3>
    maxSurge: "20%" <4>
    maxUnavailable: "10%" <5>
    pre: {} <6>
    post: {}
----
<1> The time to wait between individual pod updates. If unspecified, this value defaults to `1`.
<2> The time to wait between polling the deployment status after update. If unspecified, this value defaults to `1`.
<3> The time to wait for a scaling event before giving up. Optional; the default is `600`. Here, _giving up_ means
automatically rolling back to the previous complete deployment.
<4> `maxSurge` is optional and defaults to `25%` if not specified. See the information below the following procedure.
<5> `maxUnavailable` is optional and defaults to `25%` if not specified. See the information below the following procedure.
<6> `*pre*` and `*post*` are both xref:lifecycle-hooks[lifecycle hooks].


The Rolling strategy will:

. Execute any `pre` lifecycle hook.
. Scale up the new replication controller based on the surge count.
. Scale down the old replication controller based on the max unavailable count.
. Repeat this scaling until the new replication controller has reached the desired
replica count and the old replication controller has been scaled to zero.
. Execute any `post` lifecycle hook.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When scaling down, the Rolling strategy waits for pods to become ready so it can
decide whether further scaling would affect availability. If scaled up pods
never become ready, the deployment process will eventually time out and result in a
deployment failure.
====

The `maxUnavailable` parameter is the maximum number of pods that can be
unavailable during the update. The `maxSurge` parameter is the maximum number
of pods that can be scheduled above the original number of pods. Both parameters
can be set to either a percentage (e.g., `10%`) or an absolute value (e.g.,
`2`). The default value for both is `25%`.

These parameters allow the deployment to be tuned for availability and speed. For
example:

- `*maxUnavailable*=0` and `*maxSurge*=20%` ensures full capacity is maintained
during the update and rapid scale up.
- `*maxUnavailable*=10%` and `*maxSurge*=0` performs an update using no extra
capacity (an in-place update).
- `*maxUnavailable*=10%` and `*maxSurge*=10%` scales up and down quickly with
some potential for capacity loss.

Generally, if you want fast rollouts, use `maxSurge`. If you need to take into
account resource quota and can accept partial unavailability, use
`maxUnavailable`.

[[rolling-example]]
=== Rolling Example

Rolling deployments are the default in {product-title}. To see a rolling update,
follow these steps:

. Create an application based on the example deployment images found in
link:https://hub.docker.com/r/openshift/deployment-example/[DockerHub]:
+
----
$ oc new-app openshift/deployment-example
----
+
If you have the router installed, make the application available via a route (or
use the service IP directly)
+
----
$ oc expose svc/deployment-example
----
+
Browse to the application at `deployment-example.<project>.<router_domain>` to
verify you see the *v1* image.

. Scale the deployment configuration up to three replicas:
+
----
$ oc scale dc/deployment-example --replicas=3
----

. Trigger a new deployment automatically by tagging a new version of the example
as the `latest` tag:
+
----
$ oc tag deployment-example:v2 deployment-example:latest
----

. In your browser, refresh the page until you see the *v2* image.

. If you are using the CLI, the following command will show you how many pods are on version 1 and how many
are on version 2. In the web console, you should see the pods slowly being added to v2 and removed from v1.
+
----
$ oc describe dc deployment-example
----

During the deployment process, the new replication controller is incrementally
scaled up. Once the new pods are marked as *ready* (by passing their readiness
check), the deployment process will continue. If the pods do not become ready,
the process will abort, and the deployment configuration will be rolled back to
its previous version.


[[recreate-strategy]]
== Recreate Strategy

The Recreate strategy has basic rollout behavior and supports
xref:lifecycle-hooks[lifecycle hooks] for injecting code into the deployment
process.

The following is an example of the Recreate strategy:

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: Recreate
  recreateParams: <1>
    pre: {} <2>
    mid: {}
    post: {}
----

<1> `recreateParams` are optional.
<2> `pre`, `mid`, and `post` are xref:lifecycle-hooks[lifecycle hooks].

The Recreate strategy will:

. Execute any `pre` lifecycle hook.
. Scale down the previous deployment to zero.
. Execute any `mid` lifecycle hook.
. Scale up the new deployment.
. Execute any `post` lifecycle hook.

[IMPORTANT]
====
During scale up, if the replica count of the deployment is greater than one, the
first replica of the deployment will be validated for readiness before fully
scaling up the deployment. If the validation of the first replica fails, the
deployment will be considered a failure.
====

[[when-to-use-a-recreate-deployment]]
=== When to Use a Recreate Deployment

* When you must run migrations or other data transformations before your new code starts.
* When you do not support having new and old versions of your application code running at the same time.
* When you want to use a RWO volume, which is not supported being shared between multiple replicas.

A recreate deployment incurs downtime because, for a brief period, no instances
of your application are running. However, your old code and new code do not run
at the same time.

[[custom-strategy]]
== Custom Strategy

The Custom strategy allows you to provide your own deployment behavior.

The following is an example of the Custom strategy:

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: Custom
  customParams:
    image: organization/strategy
    command: [ "command", "arg1" ]
    environment:
      - name: ENV_1
        value: VALUE_1
----

In the above example, the `organization/strategy` container image provides the
deployment behavior. The optional `command` array overrides any `CMD` directive
specified in the image's *_Dockerfile_*. The optional environment variables
provided are added to the execution environment of the strategy process.

Additionally, {product-title} provides the following environment variables to the
deployment process:

[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===
|Environment Variable |Description

.^|`OPENSHIFT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`
|The name of the new deployment (a replication controller).

.^|`OPENSHIFT_DEPLOYMENT_NAMESPACE`
|The name space of the new deployment.
|===

The replica count of the new deployment will initially be zero. The
responsibility of the strategy is to make the new deployment active using the
logic that best serves the needs of the user.

Learn more about
xref:../../dev_guide/deployments/advanced_deployment_strategies.adoc#dev-guide-advanced-deployment-strategies[advanced deployment strategies].

Alternatively, use `customParams` to inject the custom deployment logic into the
existing deployment strategies. Provide a custom shell script logic and call the
`openshift-deploy` binary. Users do not have to supply their custom deployer
container image, but the default {product-title} deployer image will be used
instead:

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: Rolling
  customParams:
    command:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - |
      set -e
      openshift-deploy --until=50%
      echo Halfway there
      openshift-deploy
      echo Complete
----

This will result in following deployment:

[source]
----
Started deployment #2
--> Scaling up custom-deployment-2 from 0 to 2, scaling down custom-deployment-1 from 2 to 0 (keep 2 pods available, don't exceed 3 pods)
    Scaling custom-deployment-2 up to 1
--> Reached 50% (currently 50%)
Halfway there
--> Scaling up custom-deployment-2 from 1 to 2, scaling down custom-deployment-1 from 2 to 0 (keep 2 pods available, don't exceed 3 pods)
    Scaling custom-deployment-1 down to 1
    Scaling custom-deployment-2 up to 2
    Scaling custom-deployment-1 down to 0
--> Success
Complete
----

If the custom deployment strategy process requires access to the {product-title} API or the
Kubernetes API the container that executes the strategy can use the service account token
available inside the container for authentication.


[[lifecycle-hooks]]
== Lifecycle Hooks

The xref:recreate-strategy[Recreate] and xref:rolling-strategy[Rolling]
strategies support lifecycle hooks, which allow behavior to be injected into
the deployment process at predefined points within the strategy:

The following is an example of a `pre` lifecycle hook:

[source,yaml]
----
pre:
  failurePolicy: Abort
  execNewPod: {} <1>
----

<1> `execNewPod` is xref:pod-based-lifecycle-hook[a pod-based lifecycle hook].

Every hook has a `failurePolicy`, which defines the action the strategy should
take when a hook failure is encountered:

[cols="2,8"]
|===

.^|`Abort`
|The deployment process will be considered a failure if the hook fails.

.^|`Retry`
|The hook execution should be retried until it succeeds.

.^|`Ignore`
|Any hook failure should be ignored and the deployment should proceed.
|===

Hooks have a type-specific field that describes how to execute the hook.
Currently, xref:pod-based-lifecycle-hook[pod-based hooks] are the only
supported hook type, specified by the `execNewPod` field.

[[pod-based-lifecycle-hook]]
=== Pod-based Lifecycle Hook

Pod-based lifecycle hooks execute hook code in a new pod derived from the
template in a deployment configuration.

The following simplified example deployment configuration uses the
xref:rolling-strategy[Rolling strategy]. Triggers and some other minor details
are omitted for brevity:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: DeploymentConfig
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: helloworld
          image: openshift/origin-ruby-sample
  replicas: 5
  selector:
    name: frontend
  strategy:
    type: Rolling
    rollingParams:
      pre:
        failurePolicy: Abort
        execNewPod:
          containerName: helloworld <1>
          command: [ "/usr/bin/command", "arg1", "arg2" ] <2>
          env: <3>
            - name: CUSTOM_VAR1
              value: custom_value1
          volumes:
            - data <4>
----
<1> The `helloworld` name refers to `spec.template.spec.containers[0].name`.
<2> This `command` overrides any `ENTRYPOINT` defined by the `openshift/origin-ruby-sample` image.
<3> `env` is an optional set of environment variables for the hook container.
<4> `volumes` is an optional set of volume references for the hook container.

In this example, the `pre` hook will be executed in a new pod using the
*openshift/origin-ruby-sample* image from the *helloworld* container. The hook
pod will have the following properties:

* The hook command will be `/usr/bin/command arg1 arg2`.
* The hook container will have the `CUSTOM_VAR1=custom_value1` environment variable.
* The hook failure policy is `Abort`, meaning the deployment process will fail if the hook fails.
* The hook pod will inherit the `data` volume from the deployment configuration pod.

[[deployment-hooks-using-the-command-line]]
=== Using the Command Line

The `oc set deployment-hook` command can be used to set the deployment hook for
a deployment configuration. For the example above, you can set the
pre-deployment hook with the following command:

----
$ oc set deployment-hook dc/frontend --pre -c helloworld -e CUSTOM_VAR1=custom_value1 \
  -v data --failure-policy=abort -- /usr/bin/command arg1 arg2
----
