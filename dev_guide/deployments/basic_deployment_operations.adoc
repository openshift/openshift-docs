[[start-deployment]]
== Starting a Deployment

You can start a new deployment process manually using the web console, or from
the CLI:

----
$ oc rollout latest dc/<name>
----

[NOTE]
====
If a deployment process is already in progress, the command will display a
message and a new replication controller will not be deployed.
====

[[viewing-a-deployment]]

== Viewing a Deployment

To get basic information about all the available revisions of your application:

----
$ oc rollout history dc/<name>
----

This will show details about all recently created replication controllers for
the provided deployment configuration, including any currently running deployment
process.

You can view details specific to a revision by using the `--revision` flag:

----
$ oc rollout history dc/<name> --revision=1
----

For more detailed information about a deployment configuration and its latest revision:

----
$ oc describe dc <name>
----

[NOTE]
====
The
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#project-overviews[web
console] shows deployments in the *Browse* tab.
====

////
[[retrying-a-deployment]]

== Retrying a Deployment

If the current revision of your deployment configuration failed to deploy, you can
restart the deployment process with:

----
$ oc deploy --retry dc/<name>
----

If the latest revision of it was deployed successfully, the command will display a
message and the deployment process will not be retried.

[NOTE]
====
Retrying a deployment restarts the deployment process and does not create a new
deployment revision. The restarted replication controller will have the same configuration
it had when it failed.
====
////

[[rolling-back-a-deployment]]
== Rolling Back a Deployment

Rollbacks revert an application back to a previous revision and can be
performed using the REST API, the CLI, or the web console.

To rollback to the last successful deployed revision of your configuration:

----
$ oc rollout undo dc/<name>
----

The deployment configuration's template will be reverted to match the deployment
revision specified in the undo command, and a new replication controller will be
started. If no revision is specified with `--to-revision`, then the last
successfully deployed revision will be used.

Image change triggers on the deployment configuration are disabled as part of
the rollback to prevent accidentally starting a new deployment process soon after
the rollback is complete. To re-enable the image change triggers:

----
$ oc set triggers dc/<name> --auto
----

[NOTE]
====
Deployment configurations also support automatically rolling back to the
last successful revision of the configuration in case the latest deployment
process fails. In that case, the latest template that failed to deploy stays
intact by the system and it is up to users to fix their configurations.
====

[[executing-commands-inside-a-container-deployments]]
== Executing Commands Inside a Container

You can add a command to a container, which modifies the container's startup
behavior by overruling the image's `ENTRYPOINT`. This is different from a
xref:deployment_strategies.adoc#pod-based-lifecycle-hook[lifecycle hook],
which instead can be run once per deployment at a specified time.

Add the `command` parameters to the `spec` field of the deployment
configuration. You can also add an `args` field, which modifies the
`command` (or the `ENTRYPOINT` if `command` does not exist).

====
----
...
spec:
  containers:
    -
    name: <container_name>
    image: 'image'
    command:
      - '<command>'
    args:
      - '<argument_1>'
      - '<argument_2>'
      - '<argument_3>'
...
----
====

For example, to execute the `java` command with the `-jar` and
*_/opt/app-root/springboots2idemo.jar_* arguments:

====
----
...
spec:
  containers:
    -
    name: example-spring-boot
    image: 'image'
    command:
      - java
    args:
      - '-jar'
      - /opt/app-root/springboots2idemo.jar
...
----
====

[[viewing-deployment-logs]]

== Viewing Deployment Logs

To stream the logs of the latest revision for a given deployment configuration:

----
$ oc logs -f dc/<name>
----

If the latest revision is running or failed, `oc logs` will return the logs of
the process that is responsible for deploying your pods. If it is successful,
`oc logs` will return the logs from a pod of your application.

You can also view logs from older failed deployment processes, if and only if
these processes (old replication controllers and their deployer pods) exist and
have not been pruned or deleted manually:

----
$ oc logs --version=1 dc/<name>
----

For more options on retrieving logs see:

----
$ oc logs --help
----

[[triggers]]
== Setting Deployment Triggers

A deployment configuration can contain triggers, which drive the creation of
new deployment processes in response to events inside the cluster.

[WARNING]
====
If no triggers are defined on a deployment configuration, a `ConfigChange`
trigger is added by default. If triggers are defined as an empty field, deployments
must be xref:start-deployment[started manually].
====

[[config-change-trigger]]
=== Configuration Change Trigger

The `ConfigChange` trigger results in a new replication controller whenever
changes are detected in the pod template of the deployment configuration.

[NOTE]
====
If a `ConfigChange` trigger is defined on a deployment configuration,
the first replication controller will be automatically created soon after
the deployment configuration itself is created and it is not paused.
====


.A ConfigChange Trigger
====

[source,yaml]
----
triggers:
  - type: "ConfigChange"
----
====

[[image-change-trigger]]
=== ImageChange Trigger
//tag::image-change-trig[]
The `ImageChange` trigger results in a new replication controller whenever the
content of an
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-stream-tag[image
stream tag] changes (when a new version of the image is pushed).

.An ImageChange Trigger
====
[source,yaml]
----
triggers:
  - type: "ImageChange"
    imageChangeParams:
      automatic: true <1>
      from:
        kind: "ImageStreamTag"
        name: "origin-ruby-sample:latest"
        namespace: "myproject"
      containerNames:
        - "helloworld"
----
<1> If the `imageChangeParams.automatic` field is set to `false`,
the trigger is disabled.
====

With the above example, when the `latest` tag value of the *origin-ruby-sample*
image stream changes and the new image value differs from the current image
specified in the deployment configuration's *helloworld* container, a new
replication controller is created using the new image for the *helloworld* container.

[NOTE]
====
If an `ImageChange` trigger is defined on a deployment configuration (with a
`ConfigChange` trigger and `automatic=false`, or with `automatic=true`) and the
`ImageStreamTag` pointed by the `ImageChange` trigger does not exist yet, then
the initial deployment process will automatically start as soon as an image is
imported or pushed by a build to the `ImageStreamTag`.
====
//end::image-change-trig[]


[[deployment-triggers-using-the-command-line]]
==== Using the Command Line

The `oc set triggers` command can be used to set a deployment trigger for a
deployment configuration. For the example above, you can set the
`ImageChangeTrigger` by using the following command:

----
$ oc set triggers dc/frontend --from-image=myproject/origin-ruby-sample:latest -c helloworld
----

For more information, see:

----
$ oc set triggers --help
----

[[deployment-resources]]
== Setting Deployment Resources

NOTE: the ephemeral-storage resource applies only applies if your administrator has enabled the ephemeral-storage tech preview in {product-title} 3.10.

A deployment is completed by a pod that consumes resources (memory, CPU, and ephemeral storage) on a
node. By default, pods consume unbounded node resources. However, if a project
specifies default container limits, then pods consume resources up to those
limits.

You can also limit resource use by specifying resource limits as part of the
deployment strategy. Deployment resources can be used with the Recreate,
Rolling, or Custom deployment strategies.

In the following example, each of `resources`, `cpu`, `memory`, and `ephemeral-storage` is
optional:

====
[source,yaml]
----
type: "Recreate"
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: "100m" <1>
    memory: "256Mi" <2>
    ephemeral-storage: "1Gi" <3>
----

<1> `cpu` is in CPU units: `100m` represents 0.1 CPU units (100 * 1e-3).
<2> `memory` is in bytes: `256Mi` represents 268435456 bytes (256 * 2 ^ 20).
<3> `ephemeral-storage` is in bytes: `1Gi` represents 1073741824 bytes (2 ^ 30).  This only applies if your administrator has enabled the ephemeral-storage tech preview in {product-title} 3.10.
====

However, if a quota has been defined for your project, one of the following two
items is required:

- A `resources` section set with an explicit `requests`:
+
====
[source,yaml]
----
  type: "Recreate"
  resources:
    requests: <1>
      cpu: "100m"
      memory: "256Mi"
      ephemeral-storage: "1Gi"
----
<1> The `requests` object contains the list of resources that correspond to
the list of resources in the quota.
====

See
xref:../../dev_guide/compute_resources.adoc#dev-guide-compute-resources[Quotas
and Limit Ranges] to learn more about compute resources and the differences
between requests and limits.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated,openshift-origin[]
- A xref:../../admin_guide/limits.adoc#admin-guide-limits[limit range] defined in your project, where the
defaults from the `LimitRange` object apply to pods created during the
deployment process.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-online[]
- A limit range defined in your project, where the
defaults from the `LimitRange` object apply to pods created during the
deployment process.
endif::[]

Otherwise, deploy pod creation will fail, citing a failure to satisfy quota.

[[scaling]]
== Manual Scaling

In addition to rollbacks, you can exercise fine-grained control over
the number of replicas from the web console, or by using the `oc scale` command.
For example, the following command sets the replicas in the deployment
configuration `frontend` to 3.

----
$ oc scale dc frontend --replicas=3
----

The number of replicas eventually propagates to the desired and current
state of the deployment configured by the deployment configuration `frontend`.

[NOTE]
====
Pods can also be autoscaled using the `oc autoscale` command. See xref:../../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.adoc#dev-guide-pod-autoscaling[Pod Autoscaling]
for more details.
====
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
[[assigning-pods-to-specific-nodes]]
== Assigning Pods to Specific Nodes

You can use node selectors in conjunction with labeled nodes to control pod
placement.

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} administrators can assign labels
xref:../../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-node-host-labels[during
cluster installation], or
xref:../../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#updating-labels-on-nodes[added to a
node after installation].
====

Cluster administrators
xref:../../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#using-node-selectors[can set the
default node selector] for your project in order to restrict pod placement to
specific nodes. As an {product-title} developer, you can set a node selector on
a pod configuration to restrict nodes even further.

To add a node selector when creating a pod, edit the pod configuration, and add
the `nodeSelector` value. This can be added to a single pod configuration, or in
a pod template:

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    disktype: ssd
...
----

Pods created when the node selector is in place are assigned to nodes with the
specified labels.

The labels specified here are used in conjunction with the labels
xref:../../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#using-node-selectors[added by a
cluster administrator].

For example, if a project has the `type=user-node` and
`region=east` labels added to a project by the cluster administrator, and you
add the above `disktype: ssd` label to a pod, the pod will only ever be
scheduled on nodes that have all three labels.

[NOTE]
====
Labels can only be set to one value, so setting a node selector of `region=west`
in a pod configuration that has `region=east` as the administrator-set default,
results in a pod that will never be scheduled.
====
endif::[]

ifndef::openshift-online[]
[[run-pod-with-different-service-account]]
== Running a Pod with a Different Service Account

You can run a pod with a service account other than the default:

. Edit the deployment configuration:
+
----
$ oc edit dc/<deployment_config>
----
. Add the `serviceAccount` and `serviceAccountName` parameters to the `spec`
field, and specify the service account you want to use:
+
----
spec:
  securityContext: {}
  serviceAccount: <service_account>
  serviceAccountName: <service_account>
----
endif::[]


[[adding-secrets-to-deployment-config]]
== Adding Secrets to Deployment Configurations from the Web Console

Add a secret to your deployment configuration so that it can access a private
repository.

. Create a new {product-title} project.

. xref:../../dev_guide/secrets.adoc#dev-guide-secrets[Create a secret] that contains
credentials for accessing a private image repository.

. Create a deployment configuration.

. On the deployment configuration editor page or in the *fromimage* page of the
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-web-console[web
console], set the *Pull Secret*.

. Click the *Save* button.
