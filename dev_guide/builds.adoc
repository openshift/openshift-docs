== Overview

A link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#builds[build]
is the process of transforming input parameters into a resulting object. Most
often, the process is used to transform source code into a runnable image.

Build configurations are characterized by a strategy and one or more sources.
The strategy determines the aforementioned process, while the sources provide
its input.

There are three build strategies:

- Source-To-Image (S2I)
(link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[description],
link:#source-to-image-strategy-options[options])
- Docker
(link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#docker-build[description],
link:#docker-strategy-options[options])
- Custom
(link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#custom-build[description],
link:#custom-strategy-options[options])

And there are three types of build source:

- link:#source-code[Git]
- link:#dockerfile-source[Dockerfile]
- link:#binary-source[Binary]

It is up to each build strategy to consider or ignore a certain type of source,
as well as to determine how it is to be used.

Binary and Git are mutually exclusive source types, while Dockerfile can be used
by itself or together with Git and Binary.


[[defining-a-buildconfig]]

== Defining a BuildConfig

A build configuration describes a single build definition and a set of
link:#build-triggers[triggers] for when a new build should be created.

A build configuration is defined by a `*BuildConfig*`, which is a REST object
that can be used in a POST to the API server to create a new instance. The
following example `*BuildConfig*` results in a new build every time a Docker
image tag or the source code changes:

.BuildConfig Object Definition
====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: "BuildConfig"
apiVersion: "v1"
metadata:
  name: "ruby-sample-build" <1>
spec:
  triggers: <2>
    -
      type: "GitHub"
      github:
        secret: "secret101"
    -
      type: "Generic"
      generic:
        secret: "secret101"
    -
      type: "ImageChange"
  source: <3>
    type: "Git"
    git:
      uri: "git://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git"
    dockerfile: "FROM openshift/ruby-22-centos7\nUSER example"
  strategy: <4>
    type: "Source"
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: "ImageStreamTag"
        name: "ruby-20-centos7:latest"
  output: <5>
    to:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "origin-ruby-sample:latest"
----

<1> This specification will create a new `*BuildConfig*` named
*ruby-sample-build*.
<2> You can specify a list of link:#build-triggers[triggers], which cause a new
build to be created.
<3> The `*source*` section defines the source of the build. The source type
determines the primary source of input, and can be either `*Git*`, to point to a
code repository location, `*Dockerfile*`, to build from an inline Dockerfile, or
`*Binary*`, to accept binary payloads. It is possible to have multiple sources
at once, refer to the documentation for each source type for details.
<4> The `*strategy*` section describes the build strategy used to execute the
build. You can specify `*Source*`, `*Docker*` and `*Custom*` strategies here.
This above example uses the `*ruby-20-centos7*` Docker image that
Source-To-Image will use for the application build.
<5> After the Docker image is successfully built, it will be pushed into the
repository described in the `*output*` section.
====

[[source-to-image-strategy-options]]

== Source-to-Image Strategy Options

The following options are specific to the
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[S2I
build strategy].

[[s2i-force-pull]]

=== Force Pull

By default, if the builder image specified in the build configuration is
available locally on the node, that image will be used. However, to override the
local image and refresh it from the registry to which the image stream points,
create a `*BuildConfig*` with the `*forcePull*` flag set to *true*:

====
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: "Source"
  sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "builder-image:latest" <1>
    forcePull: true <2>
----

<1> The builder image being used, where the local version on the node may not be
up to date with the version in the registry to which the image stream points.
<2> This flag causes the local builder image to be ignored and a fresh version
to be pulled from the registry to which the image stream points. Setting
`*forcePull*` to *false* results in the default behavior of honoring the image
stored locally.
====

[[incremental-builds]]

=== Incremental Builds

S2I can perform incremental builds, which means it reuses artifacts from
previously-built images. To create an incremental build, create a
`*BuildConfig*` with the following modification to the strategy definition:

====
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: "Source"
  sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "incremental-image:latest" <1>
    incremental: true <2>
----

<1> Specify an image that supports incremental builds. Consult the
documentation of the builder image to determine if it supports this behavior.
<2> This flag controls whether an incremental build is attempted. If the builder
image does not support incremental builds, the build will still succeed, but you
will get a log message stating the incremental build was not successful because
of a missing *_save-artifacts_* script.
====

[NOTE]
====
See the link:../creating_images/s2i.html[S2I Requirements] topic for information
on how to create a builder image supporting incremental builds.
====

[[override-builder-image-scripts]]

=== Overriding Builder Image Scripts

You can override the *_assemble_*, *_run_*, and *_save-artifacts_*
link:../creating_images/s2i.html#s2i-scripts[S2I scripts] provided by the
builder image in one of two ways. Either:

1. Provide an *_assemble_*, *_run_*, and/or *_save-artifacts_* script in the
*_.sti/bin_* directory of your application source repository, or

2. Provide a URL of a directory containing the scripts as part of the strategy
definition. For example:

====
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: "Source"
  sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "builder-image:latest"
    scripts: "http://somehost.com/scripts_directory" <1>
----

<1> This path will have *_run_*, *_assemble_*, and *_save-artifacts_* appended
to it. If any or all scripts are found they will be used in place of the same
named script(s) provided in the image.
====

[NOTE]
====
Files located at the `*scripts*` URL take precedence over files located in
*_.sti/bin_* of the source repository. See the
link:../creating_images/s2i.html[S2I Requirements] topic and the
link:https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/blob/master/docs/builder_image.md#sti-scripts[S2I
documentation] for information on how S2I scripts are used.
====

[[configuring-the-source-environment]]
=== Environment Variables

There are two ways to make environment variables available to the
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[source build]
process and resulting \image: link:#environment-files[environment files] and
link:#buildconfig-environment[*BuildConfig* environment] values.

[[environment-files]]

==== Environment Files
Source build enables you to set environment values (one per line) inside your
application, by specifying them in a *_.sti/environment_* file in the source
repository. The environment variables specified in this file are present during
the build process and in the final Docker image. The complete list of supported
environment variables is available in the
link:../using_images/index.html[documentation] for each image.

If you provide a *_.sti/environment_* file in your source repository, S2I reads
this file during the build. This allows customization of the build behavior as
the *_assemble_* script may use these variables.

For example, if you want to disable assets compilation for your Rails
application, you can add `*DISABLE_ASSET_COMPILATION=true*` in the
*_.sti/environment_* file to cause assets compilation to be skipped during the
build.

In addition to builds, the specified environment variables are also available in
the running application itself. For example, you can add
`*RAILS_ENV=development*` to the *_.sti/environment_* file to cause the Rails
application to start in `development` mode instead of `production`.

[[buildconfig-environment]]

==== BuildConfig Environment
You can add environment variables to the `*sourceStrategy*` definition of the
`*BuildConfig*`. The environment variables defined there are visible during the
*_assemble_* script execution and will be defined in the output image, making
them also available to the *_run_* script and application code.

For example disabling assets compilation for your Rails application:

====
[source,yaml]
----
sourceStrategy:
...
  env:
    -
      name: "DISABLE_ASSET_COMPILATION"
      value: "true"
----
====

[[docker-strategy-options]]

== Docker Strategy Options

The following options are specific to the
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#docker-build[Docker
build strategy].


[[docker-strategy-from]]

=== FROM Image

The `FROM` instruction of the *_Dockerfile_* will be replaced by the `*from*` of the `*BuildConfig*`:

====
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: Docker
  dockerStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "debian:latest"
----
====


[[dockerfile-path]]

=== Dockerfile Path

By default, Docker builds use a Dockerfile (named *_Dockerfile_*) located at the
root of the context specified in the `*BuildConfig.spec.source.contextDir*`
field.

The `*dockerfilePath*` field allows the build to use a different path to
locate your Dockerfile, relative to the `*BuildConfig.spec.source.contextDir*`
field. It can be simply a different file name other than the default
*_Dockerfile_* (for example, *_MyDockerfile_*), or a path to a Dockerfile in a
subdirectory (for example, *_dockerfiles/app1/_*):

====
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: Docker
  dockerStrategy:
    dockerfilePath: dockerfiles/app1/
----
====

[[no-cache]]

=== No Cache

Docker builds normally reuse cached layers found on the host performing the
build. Setting the `*noCache*` option to *true* forces the build to ignore
cached layers and rerun all steps of the *_Dockerfile_*:

====
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: "Docker"
  dockerStrategy:
    noCache: true
----
====

[[docker-force-pull]]

=== Force Pull

By default, if the builder image specified in the build configuration is
available locally on the node, that image will be used. However, to override the
local image and refresh it from the registry to which the image stream points,
create a `*BuildConfig*` with the `*forcePull*` flag set to *true*:

====
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: "Docker"
  dockerStrategy:
    forcePull: true <1>
----
<1> This flag causes the local builder image to be ignored, and a fresh version
to be pulled from the registry to which the image stream points. Setting
`*forcePull*` to *false* results in the default behavior of honoring the image
stored locally.
====

[[docker-strategy-environment]]
=== Environment Variables

To make environment variables available to the
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#docker-build[Docker build]
process and resulting image, you can add environment variables to the
`*dockerStrategy*` definition of the `*BuildConfig*`.

The environment variables defined there are inserted as a single `ENV`
Dockerfile instruction right after the `FROM` instruction, so that it can be
referenced later on within the Dockerfile.

The variables are defined during build and stay in the output image, therefore
they will be present in any container that runs that image as well.

For example, defining a custom HTTP proxy to be used during build and runtime:

====
[source,yaml]
----
dockerStrategy:
...
  env:
    -
      name: "HTTP_PROXY"
      value: "http://myproxy.net:5187/"
----
====

[[custom-strategy-options]]

== Custom Strategy Options

The following options are specific to the
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#custom-build[Custom
build strategy].

[[expose-docker-socket]]

=== Exposing the Docker Socket

In order to allow the running of Docker commands and the building of Docker
images from inside the Docker container, the build container must be bound to an
accessible socket. To do so, set the `*exposeDockerSocket*` option to *true*:

====
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: "Custom"
  customStrategy:
    exposeDockerSocket: true
----
====

[[custom-secrets]]

=== Secrets

In addition to link:../dev_guide/secrets.html[secrets] for
link:#using-private-repositories-for-builds[source] and
link:#using-docker-credentials-for-pushing-and-pulling-images[images] that can
be added to all build types, custom strategies allow adding an arbitrary list of
secrets to the builder pod.

Each secret can be mounted at a specific location:

====
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: "Custom"
  customStrategy:
    secrets:
      -
        secretSource: <1>
          name: "secret1"
        mountPath: "/tmp/secret1" <2>
      -
        secretSource:
          name: "secret2"
        mountPath: "/tmp/secret2"
----

<1> `*secretSource*` is a reference to a secret in the same namespace as the
build.
<2> `*mountPath*` is the path inside the custom builder where the secret should
be mounted.
====

[[custom-force-pull]]

=== Force Pull

By default, when setting up the build pod, the build controller checks if the
image specified in the build configuration is available locally on the node.  If
so, that image will be used.  However, to override the local image and refresh
it from the registry to which the image stream points, create a `*BuildConfig*`
with the `*forcePull*` flag set to *true*:

====
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: "Custom"
  customStrategy:
    forcePull: true <1>
----

<1> This flag causes the local builder image to be ignored, and a fresh version
to be pulled from the registry to which the image stream points. Setting
`*forcePull*` to *false* results in the default behavior of honoring the image
stored locally.
====

[[custom-strategy-environment]]
=== Environment Variables

To make environment variables available to the
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#custom-build[Custom build]
process, you can add environment variables to the `*customStrategy*` definition
of the `*BuildConfig*`.

The environment variables defined there are passed to the pod that runs the
custom build.

For example, defining a custom HTTP proxy to be used during build:

====
[source,yaml]
----
customStrategy:
...
  env:
    -
      name: "HTTP_PROXY"
      value: "http://myproxy.net:5187/"

----
====

[[source-code]]

== Git Repository Source Options

When the `*BuildConfig.spec.source.type*` is `*Git*`, a Git repository is
required, and an inline Dockerfile is optional.

The source code is fetched from the location specified and, if the
`*BuildConfig.spec.source.dockerfile*` field is specified, the inline Dockerfile
replaces the one in the `*contextDir*` of the Git repository.

The source definition is part of the `*spec*` section in the `*BuildConfig*`:

====
[source,yaml]
----
source:
  type: "Git"
  git: <1>
    uri: "git://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git"
    ref: "master"
  contextDir: "app/dir" <2>
  dockerfile: "FROM openshift/ruby-22-centos7\nUSER example" <3>
----
<1> The `*git*` field contains the URI to the remote Git repository of the
source code. Optionally, specify the `*ref*` field to check out a specific Git
reference. A valid `*ref*` can be a SHA1 tag or a branch name.
<2> The `*contextDir*` field allows you to override the default location inside
the source code repository where the build looks for the application source
code. If your application exists inside a sub-directory, you can override the
default location (the root folder) using this field.
<3> If the optional `*dockerfile*` field is provided, it should be a string
containing a Dockerfile that overwrites any Dockerfile that may exist in the
source repository.
====

[[using-a-proxy-for-git-cloning]]

=== Using a Proxy for Git Cloning

// tag::using-a-proxy-for-git-cloning-1[]

If your Git repository can only be accessed using a proxy, you can define the
proxy to use in the `*source*` section of the `*BuildConfig*`. You can configure
both a HTTP and HTTPS proxy to use. Both fields are optional.

[NOTE]
====
Your source URI must use the HTTP or HTTPS protocol for this to work.
====

====
[source,yaml]
----
source:
  type: Git
  git:
    uri: "git://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git"
    httpProxy: http://proxy.example.com
    httpsProxy: https://proxy.example.com
----
====

// end::using-a-proxy-for-git-cloning-1[]


[[using-private-repositories-for-builds]]
=== Using Private Repositories for Builds

Supply valid credentials to build an application from a private repository.

Currently two types of authentication are supported: basic username-password
and SSH key based authentication.

[[basic-authentication]]
==== Basic Authentication

Basic authentication requires either a combination of `username` and `password`,
or a `token` to authenticate against the SCM server. A `CA certificate` file,
or a `.gitconfig` file can be attached.

A link:../dev_guide/secrets.html[`*secret*`] is used to store your keys.

. Create the `*secret*` first before using the username and password to access
the private repository:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets new-basicauth basicsecret --username=USERNAME --password=PASSWORD
----
====

.. To create a Basic Authentication Secret with a token:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets new-basicauth basicsecret --password=TOKEN
----
====

.. To create a Basic Authentication Secret with a CA certificate file:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets new-basicauth basicsecret --username=USERNAME --password=PASSWORD --ca-cert=FILENAME
----
====

.. To create a Basic Authentication Secret with a `.gitconfig` file:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets new-basicauth basicsecret --username=USERNAME --password=PASSWORD --gitconfig=FILENAME
----
====

. Add the `*secret*` to the builder service account. Each build is run with
`serviceaccount/builder` role, so you need to give it access your secret with
following command:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets add serviceaccount/builder secrets/basicsecret
----
====

. Add a `*sourceSecret*` field to the `*source*` section inside the
`*BuildConfig*` and set it to the name of the `*secret*` that you created.
In this case `*basicsecret*`:
+
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "BuildConfig"
metadata:
  name: "sample-build"
spec:
  output:
    to:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "sample-image:latest"
  source:
    git:
      uri: "https://github.com/user/app.git" <1>
    sourceSecret:
      name: "basicsecret"
    type: "Git"
  strategy:
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: "ImageStreamTag"
        name: "python-33-centos7:latest"
    type: "Source"
----
<1> The URL of private repository, accessed by basic authentication, is usually
in the `http` or `https` form.
====


[[ssh-key-authentication]]
==== SSH Key Based Authentication

SSH Key Based Authentication requires a private SSH key. A `.gitconfig` file can
also be attached.

The repository keys are usually located in the `$HOME/.ssh/` directory, and are named
`id_dsa.pub`, `id_ecdsa.pub`, `id_ed25519.pub`, or `id_rsa.pub` by default.
Generate SSH key credentials with the following command:

====

----
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Creating a passphrase for the SSH key prevents OpenShift from building. When
prompted for a passphrase, leave it blank.
====

Two files are created: the public key and a corresponding private key (one of
`id_dsa`, `id_ecdsa`, `id_ed25519`, or `id_rsa`). With both of these in place,
consult your source control management (SCM) system's manual on how to upload
the public key. The private key will be used to access your private repository.

A link:../dev_guide/secrets.html[`*secret*`] is used to store your keys.

. Create the `*secret*` first before using the SSH key to access the private
repository:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets new-sshauth sshsecret --ssh-privatekey=$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa
----
====

.. To create a SSH Based Authentication Secret with a `.gitconfig` file:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets new-sshauth sshsecret --ssh-privatekey=$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa --gitconfig=FILENAME
----
====

. Add the `*secret*` to the builder service account. Each build is run with
`serviceaccount/builder` role, so you need to give it access your secret with
following command:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets add serviceaccount/builder secrets/sshsecret
----
====

. Add a `*sourceSecret*` field into the `*source*` section inside the
`*BuildConfig*` and set it to the name of the `*secret*` that you created.
In this case `*sshsecret*`:
+
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "BuildConfig"
metadata:
  name: "sample-build"
spec:
  output:
    to:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "sample-image:latest"
  source:
    git:
      uri: "git@repository.com:user/app.git" <1>
    sourceSecret:
      name: "sshsecret"
    type: "Git"
  strategy:
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: "ImageStreamTag"
        name: "python-33-centos7:latest"
    type: "Source"
----
<1> The URL of private repository, accessed by a private SSH key, is usually
in the form `git@example.com:<username>/<repository>.git`.
====

[[other-authentication]]
==== Other

If the cloning of your application is dependent on a CA certificate,
`.gitconfig` file, or both, then you can create a secret that contains them, add
it to the builder service account, and then your `BuildConfig`.

. Create desired type of `*secret*`:

.. To create a secret from a `.gitconfig`:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets new mysecret .gitconfig=path/to/.gitconfig
----
====
.. To create a secret from a `CA certificate`:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets new mysecret ca.crt=path/to/certificate
----
====
.. To create a secret from a `CA certificate` and `.gitconfig`:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets new mysecret ca.crt=path/to/certificate .gitconfig=path/to/.gitconfig
----
====
+
[NOTE]
====
SSL verification can be turned off, if `sslVerify=false` is set for the `http`
section in your `.gitconfig` file:
----
[http]
        sslVerify=false
----
====

.  Add the `*secret*` to the builder service account. Each build is run with the
`serviceaccount/builder` role, so you need to give it access your secret with
following command:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets add serviceaccount/builder secrets/mysecret
----
====

.  Add the `*secret*` to the `*BuildConfig*`:

====
----
source:
  git:
    uri: https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex.git
  secrets:
    - secret:
        name: "mysecret"
  type: Git
----
====


[[dockerfile-source]]

== Dockerfile Source

When the `*BuildConfig.spec.source.type*` is `*Dockerfile*`, an inline
Dockerfile is used as the build input, and no additional sources can be
provided.

This source type is valid when the build strategy type is `*Docker*` or
`*Custom*`.

The source definition is part of the `*spec*` section in the `*BuildConfig*`:

====
[source,yaml]
----
source:
  type: "Dockerfile"
  dockerfile: "FROM centos:7\nRUN yum install -y httpd" <1>
----
<1> The `*dockerfile*` field contains an inline Dockerfile that will be built.
====

[[binary-source]]

== Binary Source

When the `*BuildConfig.spec.source.type*` is `*Binary*`, the build will expect a
binary as input, and an inline Dockerfile is optional.

The binary is generally assumed to be a tar, gzipped tar, or zip file depending
on the strategy. For `*Docker*` builds, this is the build context and an
optional Dockerfile may be specified to override any Dockerfile in the build
context. For `*Source*` builds, this is assumed to be an archive as described
above. For `*Source*` and `*Docker*` builds, if `*binary.asFile*` is set the
build context will consist of a single file named by the value of `*binary.asFile*`.
The `*contextDir*` field may be used when an archive is provided. Custom builds will
receive this binary as input on standard input (`stdin`).

A binary source potentially extracts content (if `*asFile*` is not set), in which case `*contextDir*`
allows changing to a subdirectory within the content before the build executes.

The source definition is part of the `*spec*` section in the `*BuildConfig*`:

====
[source,yaml]
----
source:
  type: "Binary"
  binary: <1>
    asFile: "webapp.war" <2>
  contextDir: "app/dir" <3>
  dockerfile: "FROM centos:7\nRUN yum install -y httpd" <4>
----
<1> The `*binary*` field specifies the details of the binary source.
<2> The `*asFile*` field specifies the name of the file that will be created with
the binary contents.
<3> The `*contextDir*` field specifies a subdirectory within the extracted contents of a
binary archive.
<4> If the optional `*dockerfile*` field is provided, it should be a string
containing an inline Dockerfile that potentially replaces one within the
contents of the binary archive.
====

[[starting-a-build]]

== Starting a Build

Manually start a new build from an existing build configuration in your current
project using the following command:

----
$ oc start-build <buildconfig_name>
----

Re-run a build using the `--from-build` flag:

----
$ oc start-build --from-build=<build_name>
----

Specify the `--follow` flag to stream the build's logs in stdout:

----
$ oc start-build <buildconfig_name> --follow
----

Specify the `--env` flag to set any desired environment variable for the build:

----
$ oc start-build <buildconfig_name> --env=<key>=<value>
----

Rather than relying on a Git source pull or a Dockerfile for a build, you can
can also start a build by directly pushing your source, which could be the
contents of a Git or SVN working directory, a set of prebuilt binary artifacts
you want to deploy, or a single file. This can be done by specifying one of the
following options for the `start-build` command:

[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
|Option |Description

|`--from-dir=<directory>`
|Specifies a directory that will be archived and used as a binary input for the
build.

|`--from-file=<file>`
|Specifies a single file that will be the only file in the build source. The
file is placed in the root of an empty directory with the same file name as the original file provided.

|`--from-repo=<local_source_repo>`
|Specifies a path to a local repository to use as the binary input for a build.
Add the `--commit` option to control which branch, tag, or commit is used for
the build.
|===

When passing any of these options directly to the build, the contents are
streamed to the build and override the current build source settings.

[NOTE]
====
Builds triggered from binary input will not preserve the source on the server,
so rebuilds triggered by base image changes will use the source specified in the
build configuration.
====

For example, the following command sends the contents of a local Git repository
as an archive from the tag `v2` and starts a build:

====
----
$ oc start-build hello-world --from-repo=../hello-world --commit=v2
----
====

[[canceling-a-build]]

== Canceling a Build
Manually cancel a build using the web console, or with the following CLI command:

----
$ oc cancel-build <build_name>
----

[[viewing-build-details]]
== Viewing Build Details

You can view build details using the web console or the following CLI command:

----
$ oc describe build <build_name>
----

The output of the `describe` command includes details such as the build source,
strategy, and output destination. If the build uses the Docker or Source
strategy, it will also include information about the source revision used for
the build: commit ID, author, committer, and message.

[[accessing-build-logs]]

== Accessing Build Logs
You can access build logs using the web console or the CLI.

To stream the logs using the build directly:

----
$ oc logs -f build/<build_name>
----

To stream the logs of the latest build for a build configuration:

----
$ oc logs -f bc/<buildconfig_name>
----

To return the logs of a given version build for a build configuration:

----
$ oc logs --version=<number> bc/<buildconfig_name>
----

*Log Verbosity*

To enable more verbose output, pass the `*BUILD_LOGLEVEL*` environment variable
as part of the `*sourceStrategy*` or `*dockerStrategy*` in a `*BuildConfig*`:

====
[source,yaml]
----
sourceStrategy:
...
  env:
    -
      name: "BUILD_LOGLEVEL"
      value: "2" <1>
----

<1> Adjust this value to the desired log level.
====

NOTE: A platform administrator can set verbosity for the entire OpenShift
instance by passing the `--loglevel` option to the `openshift start` command.
If both `--loglevel` and `BUILD_LOGLEVEL` are specified, `BUILD_LOGLEVEL` takes precedence.

Available log levels for Source builds are as follows:

[horizontal]
Level 0:: Produces output from containers running the *_assemble_* script and all encountered errors. This is the default.
Level 1:: Produces basic information about the executed process.
Level 2:: Produces very detailed information about the executed process.
Level 3:: Produces very detailed information about the executed process, and a listing of the archive contents.
Level 4:: Currently produces the same information as level 3.
Level 5:: Produces everything mentioned on previous levels and additionally provides docker push messages.

[[setting-maximum-duration]]
== Setting Maximum Duration

When defining a `*BuildConfig*`, you can define its maximum duration by setting
the  `*completionDeadlineSeconds*` field. It is specified in seconds and is not
set by default. When not set, there is no maximum duration enforced.

The maximum duration is counted from the time when a build pod gets scheduled in
the system, and defines how long it can be active, including the time needed to
pull the builder image. After reaching the specified timeout, the build is
terminated by OpenShift.

The following example shows the part of a `*BuildConfig*` specifying
`*completionDeadlineSeconds*` field for 30 minutes:

====
----
spec:
  completionDeadlineSeconds: 1800
----
====


[[build-triggers]]

== Build Triggers
When defining a `*BuildConfig*`, you can define triggers to control the
circumstances in which the `*BuildConfig*` should be run. The following build
triggers are available:

* link:#webhook-triggers[Webhook]
* link:#image-change-triggers[Image change]
* link:#config-change-triggers[Configuration change]

[[webhook-triggers]]

=== Webhook Triggers
Webhook triggers allow you to trigger a new build by sending a request to the
OpenShift API endpoint. You can define these triggers using
https://developer.github.com/webhooks/[GitHub webhooks] or Generic webhooks.

*GitHub Webhooks*

https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/[GitHub webhooks] handle the call
made by GitHub when a repository is updated. When defining the trigger, you must
specify a `*secret*`, which will be part of the URL you supply to GitHub when
configuring the webhook. The secret ensures the uniqueness of the URL, preventing
others from triggering the build. The following example is a trigger definition
YAML within the `*BuildConfig*`:

====
[source,yaml]
----
type: "GitHub"
github:
  secret: "secret101"
----
====

[NOTE]
====
The secret field in webhook trigger configuration is not the same as `*secret*`
field you encounter when configuring webhook in GitHub UI. The former is to make
the webhook URL unique and hard to predict, the latter is an optional string field
used to create HMAC hex digest of the body, which is sent as an `X-Hub-Signature`
https://developer.github.com/webhooks/#delivery-headers[header].
====

The payload URL is returned as the GitHub Webhook URL by the `describe` command
(see link:#describe-buildconfig[below]), and is structured as follows:

----
http://<openshift_api_host:port>/oapi/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/github
----

[NOTE]
====
https://gogs.io[Gogs] supports the same webhook payload format as GitHub.
Therefore, if you are using a Gogs server, you can define a GitHub webhook
trigger on your `*BuildConfig*` and trigger it via your Gogs server also.
====


*Generic Webhooks*

Generic webhooks can be invoked from any system capable of making a web request.
As with a GitHub webhook, you must specify a `*secret*` which will be part of
the URL, the caller must use to trigger the build. The secret ensures the
uniqueness of the URL, preventing others from triggering the build. The
following is an example trigger definition YAML within the `*BuildConfig*`:

====
[source,yaml]
----
type: "Generic"
generic:
  secret: "secret101"
----
====

To set up the caller, supply the calling system with the URL of the generic
webhook endpoint for your build:

----
http://<openshift_api_host:port>/oapi/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/generic
----

The endpoint can accept an optional payload with the following format:

====
[source,yaml]
----
type: "git"
git:
  uri: "<url to git repository>"
  ref: "<optional git reference>"
  commit: "<commit hash identifying a specific git commit>"
  author:
    name: "<author name>"
    email: "<author e-mail>"
  committer:
    name: "<committer name>"
    email: "<committer e-mail>"
  message: "<commit message>"
----
====

[[describe-buildconfig]]

*Displaying a BuildConfig's Webhook URLs*

Use the following command to display the webhook URLs associated with a build
configuration:

----
$ oc describe bc <name>
----

If the above command does not display any webhook URLs, then no webhook trigger
is defined for that build configuration.

[[image-change-triggers]]

=== Image Change Triggers
Image change triggers allow your build to be automatically invoked when a new
version of an upstream image is available. For example, if a build is based on
top of a RHEL image, then you can trigger that build to run any time the RHEL
image changes. As a result, the application image is always running on the
latest RHEL base image.

Configuring an image change trigger requires the following actions:

. Define an `*ImageStream*` that points to the upstream image you want to
trigger on:
+
====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: "ImageStream"
apiVersion: "v1"
metadata:
  name: "ruby-20-centos7"
----
====
+
This defines the image stream that is tied to a Docker image repository
located at `_<system-registry>_/_<namespace>_/ruby-20-centos7`. The
`_<system-registry>_` is defined as a service with the name `docker-registry`
running in OpenShift.

. If an image stream is the base image for the build, set the from field in the
build strategy to point to the image stream:
+
====
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: "Source"
  sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "ruby-20-centos7:latest"
----
====
+
In this case, the `*sourceStrategy*` definition is consuming the `latest` tag of
the image stream named `ruby-20-centos7` located within this namespace.

. Define a build with one or more triggers that point to image streams:
+
====
[source,yaml]
----
type: "imageChange" <1>
imageChange: {}
type: "imagechange" <2>
imageChange:
  from:
    kind: "ImageStreamTag"
    name: "custom-image:latest"
----
<1> An image change trigger that monitors the `*ImageStream*` and `*Tag*` as
defined by the build strategy's `*from*` field. The `*imageChange*` object here
must be empty.
<2> An image change trigger that monitors an arbitrary image stream. The
`*imageChange*` part in this case must include a `*from*` field that references
the `*ImageStreamTag*` to monitor.
====

When using an image change trigger for the strategy image stream, the generated build
is supplied with an immutable Docker tag that points to the latest image corresponding
to that tag. This new image reference will be used by the strategy
when it executes for the build. For other image change triggers that do not
reference the strategy image stream, a new build will be started, but the build
strategy will not be updated with a unique image reference.

In the example above that has an image change trigger for the strategy, the resulting build will be:

====
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: "Source"
  sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "DockerImage"
      name: "172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos7:immutableid"
----
====

This ensures that the triggered build uses the new image that was just pushed to
the repository, and the build can be re-run any time with the same inputs.

In addition to setting the image field for all `*Strategy*` types, for custom
builds, the `OPENSHIFT_CUSTOM_BUILD_BASE_IMAGE` environment variable is checked.
If it does not exist, then it is created with the immutable image reference. If
it does exist then it is updated with the immutable image reference.

If a build is triggered due to a webhook trigger or manual request,
the build that is created uses the `*immutableid*` resolved from the
`*ImageStream*` referenced by the `*Strategy*`. This ensures that builds
are performed using consistent image tags for ease of reproduction.

[NOTE]
====
Image streams that point to Docker images in
http://docs.docker.com/v1.7/reference/api/hub_registry_spec/#docker-registry-1-0[v1
Docker registries] only trigger a build once when the image stream tag becomes
available and not on subsequent image updates. This is due to the lack of
uniquely identifiable images in v1 Docker registries.
====

[[config-change-triggers]]
=== Configuration Change Triggers
A configuration change trigger allows a build to be automatically invoked as
soon as a new `*BuildConfig*` is created. The following is an example trigger
definition YAML within the `*BuildConfig*`:

====
[source,yaml]
----
  type: "ConfigChange"
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Configuration change triggers currently only work when creating a new
`*BuildConfig*`. In a future release, configuration change triggers will also be
able to launch a build whenever a `*BuildConfig*` is updated.
====

[[using-docker-credentials-for-pushing-and-pulling-images]]
== Using Docker Credentials for Pushing and Pulling Images

Supply the *_.dockercfg_* file with valid Docker Registry credentials in order to
push the output image into a private Docker Registry or pull the builder image
from the private Docker Registry that requires authentication. For the OpenShift
Docker Registry, you don't have to do this because `*secrets*` are generated
automatically for you by OpenShift.

The *_.dockercfg_* JSON file is found in your home directory by default and has
the following format:

====
[source,json]
----
{
	"https://index.docker.io/v1/": { <1>
		"auth": "YWRfbGzhcGU6R2labnRib21ifTE=", <2>
		"email": "user@example.com" <3>
	}
}
----
<1> URL of the registry.
<2> Encrypted password.
<3> Email address for the login.
====

You can define multiple Docker registry entries in this file. Alternatively, you
can also add authentication entries to this file by running the `docker login`
command. The file will be created if it does not exist. Kubernetes provides
link:../dev_guide/secrets.html[`*secret*`] objects, which are used to store your
configuration and passwords.

. Create the `*secret*` from your local *_.dockercfg_* file:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets new dockerhub ~/.dockercfg
----
====
+
This generates a JSON specification of the `*secret*` named *dockerhub* and
creates the object.

. Once the `*secret*` is created, add it to the builder service account. Each
build is run with `serviceaccount/builder` role, so you need to give it access
your secret with following command:

+
====
----
$ oc secrets add serviceaccount/builder secrets/dockerhub
----
====

. Add a `*pushSecret*` field into the `*output*` section of the `*BuildConfig*` and
set it to the name of the `*secret*` that you created, which in the above example
is *dockerhub*:
+
====
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  output:
    to:
      kind: "DockerImage"
      name: "private.registry.com/org/private-image:latest"
    pushSecret:
      name: "dockerhub"
----
====

. Pull the builder Docker image from a private Docker registry by specifying the
`*pullSecret*` field, which is part of the build strategy definition:
+
====
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "DockerImage"
      name: "docker.io/user/private_repository"
    pullSecret:
      name: "dockerhub"
  type: "Source"
----
====

[NOTE]
====
This example uses `*pullSecret*` in a Source build, but it is also applicable
in Docker and Custom builds.
====

[[build-output]]
== Build Output

Docker and Source builds result in the creation of a new Docker image. The image
is then pushed to the registry specified in the `*output*` section of the
`*Build*` specification.

If the output kind is `*ImageStreamTag*`, then the image will be pushed to the
integrated OpenShift registry and tagged in the specified image stream. If the
output is of type `*DockerImage*`, then the name of the output reference will be
used as a Docker push specification. The specification may contain a registry or
will default to DockerHub if no registry is specified. If the output section of
the build specification is empty, then the image will not be pushed at the end
of the build.

|The Git reference used in the build

|`*OPENSHIFT_BUILD_COMMIT*`
|Source commit used in the build
|===

[[output-image-labels]]
=== Output Image Labels

Docker and Source builds set the following labels on output images:

[options="header"]
|===

|Label |Description

|*io.openshift.build.commit.author*
|Author of the source commit used in the build

|*io.openshift.build.commit.date*
|Date of the source commit used in the build

|Hash of the source commit used in the build

|*io.openshift.build.commit.message*
|Message of the source commit used in the build

|*io.openshift.build.commit.ref*
|Branch or reference specified in the source

|*io.openshift.build.source-location*
|Source URL for the build
|===

[[using-external-artifacts]]
== Using External Artifacts During a Build

It is not recommended to store binary files in a source repository. Therefore,
you may find it necessary to define a build which pulls additional files (such
as Java *_.jar_* dependencies) during the build process. How this is done
depends on the build strategy you are using.

For a `*Source*` build strategy, you must put appropriate shell commands into
the *_assemble_* script:

.*_.sti/bin/assemble_* File
====

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/sh
APP_VERSION=1.0
wget http://repository.example.com/app/app-$APP_VERSION.jar -O app.jar
----
====

.*_.sti/bin/run_* File
====

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/sh
exec java -jar app.jar
----
====

[NOTE]
====
For more information on how to control which *_assemble_* and *_run_* script is
used by a Source build, see link:#override-builder-image-scripts[Overriding
Builder Image Scripts].
====

For a `*Docker*` build strategy, you must modify the *_Dockerfile_* and invoke
shell commands with the
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run[`RUN` instruction]:

.Excerpt of `Dockerfile`
====

[source]
----
FROM jboss/base-jdk:8

ENV APP_VERSION 1.0
RUN wget http://repository.example.com/app/app-$APP_VERSION.jar -O app.jar

EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "java", "-jar", "app.jar" ]
----
====

In practice, you may want to use an environment variable for the file location
so that the specific file to be downloaded can be customized using an
environment variable defined on the `BuildConfig`, rather than updating the
*_assemble_* script or *_Dockerfile_*.

You can choose between different methods of defining environment variables:

- link:#environment-files[Using the *_.sti/environment_* file] (only for a
`*Source*` build strategy)
- link:#buildconfig-environment[Setting in `*BuildConfig*`]
- link:../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html#build-and-deployment-cli-operations[Providing
explicitly using `*oc start-build --env*`] (only for builds that are triggered
manually)
