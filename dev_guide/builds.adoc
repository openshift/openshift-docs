== Overview
A link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#builds[build] is a process of creating
runnable images to be used on OpenShift. There are three build strategies:

- Source-To-Image (S2I) (link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[description], link:#source-to-image-strategy-options[options])
- Docker (link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#docker-build[description], link:#docker-strategy-options[options])
- Custom (link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#custom-build[description], link:#custom-strategy-options[options])

[[defining-a-buildconfig]]

== Defining a BuildConfig

A build configuration describes a single build definition and a set of
link:#build-triggers[triggers] for when a new build should be created.

A build configuration is defined by a `*BuildConfig*`, which is a REST object
that can be used in a POST to the API server to create a new instance. The
following example `*BuildConfig*` results in a new build every time a Docker
image tag or the source code changes:

.BuildConfig Object Definition
====

[source,json]

{
  "kind": "BuildConfig",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {

      {
        "type": "GitHub",
        "github": {
          "secret": "secret101"
        }
      },
      {
        "type": "Generic",
        "generic": {
          "secret": "secret101"
        }
      },
      {
        "type": "ImageChange"
      }
    ],
    "source": { <3>
      "type": "Git",
      "git": {
        "uri": "https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world"
      }
    },
    "strategy": { <4>
      "type": "Source",
      "sourceStrategy": {
        "from": {
          "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
          "name": "ruby-20-centos7:latest"

        "name": "origin-ruby-sample:latest"
      }
    }
  }
}
----

<1> This specification will create a new `*BuildConfig*` named
*ruby-sample-build*.
<2> You can specify a list of link:#build-triggers[triggers], which cause a new
build to be created.
<3> The `*source*` section defines the source code repository location. You can
provide additional options, such as `*sourceSecret*` or `*contextDir*` here.
<4> The `*strategy*` section describes the build strategy used to execute the
build. You can specify `*Source*`, `*Docker*` and `*Custom*` strategies here.
This above example uses the `*ruby-20-centos7*` Docker image that
Source-To-Image will use for the application build.
<5> After the Docker image is successfully built, it will be pushed into the
repository described in the `*output*` section.
====

[[source-to-image-strategy-options]]

== Source-to-Image Strategy Options

The following options are specific to the
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[S2I
build strategy].

[[s2i-force-pull]]

=== Force Pull

By default, if the builder image specified in the build configuration is
available locally on the node, that image will be used. However, to override the
local image and refresh it from the registry to which the image stream points,
create a `*BuildConfig*` with the `*forcePull*` flag set to *true*:

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "strategy": {
    "type": "Source",
    "sourceStrategy": {
      "from": {
        "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
        "name": "builder-image:latest" <1>
      },
      "forcePull": true <2>
    }
  }
}
----

<1> The builder image being used, where the local version on the node may not be
up to date with the version in the registry to which the image stream points.
<2> This flag causes the local builder image to be ignored and a fresh version
to be pulled from the registry to which the image stream points. Setting
`*forcePull*` to *false* results in the default behavior of honoring the image
stored locally.
====

[[incremental-builds]]

=== Incremental Builds

S2I can perform incremental builds, which means it reuses artifacts from
previously-built images. To create an incremental build, create a
`*BuildConfig*` with the following modification to the strategy definition:

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "strategy": {
    "type": "Source",
    "sourceStrategy": {
      "from": {
        "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
        "name": "incremental-image:latest" <1>
      },
      "incremental": true <2>
    }
  }
}
----

<1> Specify an image that supports incremental builds. The S2I images provided
by OpenShift do not implement artifact reuse, so setting `*incremental*`  to
*true* will have no effect on builds using those builder images.
<2> This flag controls whether an incremental build is attempted. If the builder
image does not support incremental builds, the build will still succeed, but you
will get a log message stating the incremental build was not successful because
of a missing *_save-artifacts_* script.
====

[NOTE]
====
See the link:../creating_images/s2i.html[S2I Requirements] topic for information
on how to create a builder image supporting incremental builds.
====

[[override-builder-image-scripts]]

=== Override Builder Image Scripts

You can override the *_assemble_*, *_run_*, and *_save-artifacts_*
link:../creating_images/s2i.html#s2i-scripts[S2I scripts] provided by the
builder image in one of two ways. Either:

1. Provide an *_assemble_*, *_run_*, and/or *_save-artifacts_* script in the
*_.sti/bin_* directory of your application source repository, or

2. Provide a URL of a directory containing the scripts as part of the strategy
definition. For example:

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "strategy": {
    "type": "Source",
    "sourceStrategy": {
      "from": {
        "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
        "name": "builder-image:latest"
      },
      "scripts": "http://somehost.com/scripts_directory" <1>
    }
  }
}
----

<1> This path will have *_run_*, *_assemble_*, and *_save-artifacts_* appended
to it. If any or all scripts are found they will be used in place of the same
named script(s) provided in the image.
====

[NOTE]
====
Files located at the `*scripts*` URL take precedence over files located in
*_.sti/bin_* of the source repository. See the
link:../creating_images/s2i.html[S2I Requirements] topic and the
link:https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/blob/master/docs/builder_image.md#sti-scripts[S2I
documentation] for information on how S2I scripts are used.
====

[[configuring-the-source-environment]]
=== Environment Variables

There are two ways to make environment variables available to the
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[source build]
process and resulting \image: link:#environment-files[environment files] and
link:#buildconfig-environment[*BuildConfig* environment] values.

[[environment-files]]

==== Environment Files
Source build enables you to set environment values (one per line) inside your
application, by specifying them in a *_.sti/environment_* file in the source
repository. The environment variables specified in this file are present during
the build process and in the final Docker image. The complete list of supported
environment variables is available in the
link:../using_images/index.html[documentation] for each image.

If you provide a *_.sti/environment_* file in your source repository, S2I reads
this file during the build. This allows customization of the build behavior as
the *_assemble_* script may use these variables.

For example, if you want to disable assets compilation for your Rails
application, you can add `*DISABLE_ASSET_COMPILATION=true*` in the
*_.sti/environment_* file to cause assets compilation to be skipped during the
build.

In addition to builds, the specified environment variables are also available in
the running application itself. For example, you can add
`*RAILS_ENV=development*` to the *_.sti/environment_* file to cause the Rails
application to start in `development` mode instead of `production`.

[[buildconfig-environment]]

==== BuildConfig Environment
You can add environment variables to the `*sourceStrategy*` definition of the
`*BuildConfig*`. The environment variables defined there are visible during the
*_assemble_* script execution and will be defined in the output image, making
them also available to the *_run_* script and application code.

For example disabling assets compilation for your Rails application:

====

----
{
  "sourceStrategy": {
    ...
    "env": [
      {
        "name": "DISABLE_ASSET_COMPILATION",
        "value": "true"
      }
    ]
  }
}
----
====

[[docker-strategy-options]]

== Docker Strategy Options

The following options are specific to the
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#docker-build[Docker
build strategy].

[[no-cache]]

=== No Cache

Docker builds normally reuse cached layers found on the host performing the
build. Setting the `*noCache*` option to *true* forces the build to ignore
cached layers and rerun all steps of the *_Dockerfile_*:

====

[source,json]
----
strategy:
  type: "Docker"
  dockerStrategy:
    noCache: true
----
====

[[docker-force-pull]]

=== Force Pull

By default, if the builder image specified in the build configuration is
available locally on the node, that image will be used. However, to override the
local image and refresh it from the registry to which the image stream points,
create a `*BuildConfig*` with the `*forcePull*` flag set to *true*:

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "strategy": {
    "type": "Docker",
    "dockerStrategy": {
      "forcePull": true <1>
    }
  }
}
----

<1> This flag causes the local builder image to be ignored, and a fresh version
to be pulled from the registry to which the image stream points. Setting
`*forcePull*` to *false* results in the default behavior of honoring the image
stored locally.
====

[[docker-strategy-environment]]
=== Environment Variables

To make environment variables available to the
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#docker-build[Docker build]
process and resulting image, you can add environment variables to the
`*dockerStrategy*` definition of the `*BuildConfig*`.

The environment variables defined there are inserted as a single ENV Dockerfile
instruction right after the FROM instruction, so that it can be referenced later
on within the Dockerfile.

The variables are defined during build and stay in the output image, therefore
they will be present in any container that runs that image as well.

For example, defining a custom HTTP proxy to be used during build and runtime:

====

----
{
  "dockerStrategy": {
    ...
    "env": [
      {
        "name": "HTTP_PROXY",
        "value": "http://myproxy.net:5187/"
      }
    ]
  }
}
----
====



[[custom-strategy-options]]

== Custom Strategy Options

The following options are specific to the
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#custom-build[Custom
build strategy].

[[expose-docker-socket]]

=== Exposing the Docker Socket

In order to allow the running of Docker commands and the building of Docker
images from inside the Docker container, the build container must be bound to an
accessible socket. To do so, set the `*exposeDockerSocket*` option to *true*:

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "strategy": {
    "type": "Custom",
    "customStrategy": {
      "exposeDockerSocket": true
    }
  }
}
----
====

[[custom-secrets]]

=== Secrets

In addition to link:../dev_guide/secrets.html[secrets] for
link:#using-private-repositories-for-builds[source] and
link:#using-docker-credentials-for-pushing-and-pulling-images[images] that can
be added to all build types, custom strategies allow adding an arbitrary list of
secrets to the builder pod.

Each secret can be mounted at a specific location:

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "strategy": {
    "type": "Custom",
    "customStrategy": {
      "secrets": [
        {
          "secretSource": { <1>
            "name": "secret1"
          },
          "mountPath": "/tmp/secret1" <2>
        },
        {
          "secretSource": {
            "name": "secret2"
          },
          "mountPath": "/tmp/secret2"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

<1> `*secretSource*` is a reference to a secret in the same namespace as the
build.
<2> `*mountPath*` is the path inside the custom builder where the secret should
be mounted.
====

[[custom-force-pull]]

=== Force Pull

By default, when setting up the build pod, the build controller checks if the
image specified in the build configuration is available locally on the node.  If
so, that image will be used.  However, to override the local image and refresh
it from the registry to which the image stream points, create a `*BuildConfig*`
with the `*forcePull*` flag set to *true*:

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "strategy": {
    "type": "Custom",
    "customStrategy": {
      "forcePull": true <1>
    }
  }
}
----

<1> This flag causes the local builder image to be ignored, and a fresh version
to be pulled from the registry to which the image stream points. Setting
`*forcePull*` to *false* results in the default behavior of honoring the image
stored locally.
====

[[custom-strategy-environment]]
=== Environment Variables

To make environment variables available to the
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#custom-build[Custom build]
process, you can add environment variables to the `*customStrategy*` definition
of the `*BuildConfig*`.

The environment variables defined there are passed to the pod that runs the
custom build.

For example, defining a custom HTTP proxy to be used during build:

====

----
{
  "customStrategy": {
    ...
    "env": [
      {
        "name": "HTTP_PROXY",
        "value": "http://myproxy.net:5187/"
      }
    ]
  }
}
----
====

[[using-a-proxy-for-git-cloning]]

== Using a Proxy for Git Cloning

// tag::using-a-proxy-for-git-cloning-1[]

If your Git repository can only be accessed using a proxy, you can define the
proxy to use in the `*source*` section of the `*BuildConfig*`. You can configure
both a HTTP and HTTPS proxy to use. Both fields are optional.

[NOTE]
====
Your source URI must use the HTTP or HTTPS protocol for this to work.
====

====
----
...
source:
  type: Git
  git:
    uri: "https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world"
    httpProxy: http://proxy.example.com
    httpsProxy: https://proxy.example.com
...
----
====

// end::using-a-proxy-for-git-cloning-1[]


[[using-private-repositories-for-builds]]
=== Using Private Repositories for Builds

Supply valid credentials to build an application from a private repository.

Currently two types of authentication are supported: basic username-password
and SSH key based authentication.

[[basic-authentication]]
==== Basic Authentication

Basic authentication requires either a combination of `username` and `password`,
or a `token` to authenticate against the SCM server. A `CA certificate` file,
or a `.gitconfig` file can be attached.

A link:../dev_guide/secrets.html[`*secret*`] is used to store your keys.

. Create the `*secret*` first before using the username and password to access
the private repository:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets new-basicauth basicsecret --username=USERNAME --password=PASSWORD
----
====

.. To create a Basic Authentication Secret with a token:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets new-basicauth basicsecret --password=TOKEN
----
====

.. To create a Basic Authentication Secret with a CA certificate file:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets new-basicauth basicsecret --username=USERNAME --password=PASSWORD --ca-cert=FILENAME
----
====

.. To create a Basic Authentication Secret with a `.gitconfig` file:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets new-basicauth basicsecret --username=USERNAME --password=PASSWORD --gitconfig=FILENAME
----
====

. Add the `*secret*` to the builder service account. Each build is run with
`serviceaccount/builder` role, so you need to give it access your secret with
following command:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets add serviceaccount/builder secrets/basicsecret
----
====

. Add a `*sourceSecret*` field to the `*source*` section inside the
`*BuildConfig*` and set it to the name of the `*secret*` that you created.
In this case `*basicsecret*`:
+
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "BuildConfig"
metadata:
  name: "sample-build"
spec:
  output:
    to:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "sample-image:latest"
  source:
    git:
      uri: "https://github.com/user/app.git" <1>
    sourceSecret:
      name: "basicsecret"
    type: "Git"
  strategy:
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: "ImageStreamTag"
        name: "python-33-centos7:latest"
    type: "Source"
----
<1> The URL of private repository, accessed by basic authentication, is usually
in the `http` or `https` form.
====


[[ssh-key-authentication]]
==== SSH Key Based Authentication

SSH Key Based Authentication requires a private SSH key. A `.gitconfig` file can
also be attached.

The repository keys are usually located in the `$HOME/.ssh/` directory, and are named
`id_dsa.pub`, `id_ecdsa.pub`, `id_ed25519.pub`, or `id_rsa.pub` by default.
Generate SSH key credentials with the following command:

====

----
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
----
====

[NOTE]
====
For a SSH key to work in OpenShift builds, it must not have a passphrase set. When prompted
for a passphrase, leave it blank.
====

Two files are created: the public key and a corresponding private key (one of
`id_dsa`, `id_ecdsa`, `id_ed25519`, or `id_rsa`). With both of these in place,
consult your source control management (SCM) system's manual on how to upload
the public key. The private key will be used to access your private repository.

A link:../dev_guide/secrets.html[`*secret*`] is used to store your keys.

. Create the `*secret*` first before using the SSH key to access the private
repository:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets new-sshauth sshsecret --ssh-privatekey=$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa
----
====

.. To create a SSH Based Authentication Secret with a `.gitconfig` file:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets new-sshauth sshsecret --ssh-privatekey=$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa --gitconfig=FILENAME
----
====

. Add the `*secret*` to the builder service account. Each build is run with
`serviceaccount/builder` role, so you need to give it access your secret with
following command:
+
====

----
$ oc secrets add serviceaccount/builder secrets/sshsecret
----
====

. Add a `*sourceSecret*` field into the `*source*` section inside the
`*BuildConfig*` and set it to the name of the `*secret*` that you created.
In this case `*sshsecret*`:
+
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "BuildConfig"
metadata:
  name: "sample-build"
spec:
  output:
    to:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "sample-image:latest"
  source:
    git:
      uri: "git@repository.com:user/app.git" <1>
    sourceSecret:
      name: "sshsecret"
    type: "Git"
  strategy:
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: "ImageStreamTag"
        name: "python-33-centos7:latest"
    type: "Source"
----
<1> The URL of private repository, accessed by a private SSH key, is usually
in the form `git@example.com:<username>/<repository>.git`.
====

[[other-authentication]]
==== Other

In case the cloning of your application is dependent on a `CA certificate`, `.gitconfig`
file or both, you can create a secret that contains them, add it to the builder service
account and then your `BuildConfig`.

. Create desired type of `*secret*`:

.. To create a secret from a `.gitconfig`:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets new mysecret .gitconfig=path/to/.gitconfig
----
====
.. To create a secret from a `CA certificate`:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets new mysecret ca.crt=path/to/certificate
----
====
.. To create a secret from a `CA certificate` and `.gitconfig`:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets new mysecret ca.crt=path/to/certificate .gitconfig=path/to/.gitconfig
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Please note that SSL verification can be turned off, if `sslVerify=false` is set
for the `http` section in your `.gitconfig` file:
----
[http]
        sslVerify=false
----
====

. Add the `*secret*` to the builder service account. Each build is run with
`serviceaccount/builder` role, so you need to give it access your secret with
following command:

+
====
----
$ oc secrets add serviceaccount/builder secrets/mysecret
----
====


[[dockerfile-source]]

== Dockerfile Source

When the `*BuildConfig.spec.source.type*` is `*Dockerfile*`, an inline
Dockerfile is used as the build input, and no additional sources can be
provided.

This source type is valid when the build strategy type is `*Docker*` or
`*Custom*`.

The source definition is part of the `*spec*` section in the `*BuildConfig*`:

====
[source,yaml]
----
source:
  type: "Dockerfile"
  dockerfile: "FROM centos:7\nRUN yum install -y httpd" <1>
----
<1> The `*dockerfile*` field contains an inline Dockerfile that will be built.
====

[[binary-source]]

== Binary Source

When the `*BuildConfig.spec.source.type*` is `*Binary*`, the build will expect a
binary as input, and an inline Dockerfile is optional.

The binary is generally assumed to be a tar, gzipped tar, or zip file depending
on the strategy. For `*Docker*` builds, this is the build context and an
optional Dockerfile may be specified to override any Dockerfile in the build
context. For `*Source*` builds, this is assumed to be an archive as described
above. For `*Source*` and `*Docker*` builds, if `*binary.asFile*` is set the
build will receive a directory with a single file. The `*contextDir*` field may
be used when an archive is provided. Custom builds will receive this binary as
input on standard input (`stdin`).

A binary source potentially extracts content, in which case `*contextDir*`
allows changing to a subdirectory within the content before the build executes.

The source definition is part of the `*spec*` section in the `*BuildConfig*`:

====
[source,yaml]
----
source:
  type: "Binary"
  binary: <1>
    asFile: "webapp.war" <2>
  contextDir: "app/dir" <3>
  dockerfile: "FROM centos:7\nRUN yum install -y httpd" <4>
----
<1> The `*binary*` field specifies the details of the binary source.
<2> The `*asFile*` field specifies the name of a file that will be created with
the binary contents.
<3> The `*contextDir*` field specifies a subdirectory with the contents of a
binary archive.
<4> If the optional `*dockerfile*` field is provided, it should be a string
containing an inline Dockerfile that potentially replaces one within the
contents of the binary archive.
====

[[image-source]]

== Image Source

Additional files can be provided to the build process via images.  Input
images are referenced in the same way the `From` and `To` image targets
are defined.  This means both docker images and image stream
tags can be referenced.  In conjunction with the image, you must provide one or
more path pairs to indicate the path of the files/directories to copy out of the
image and the destination to place them in the build context.

The source path can be any absolute path within the image specified.  The destination
must be a relative directory path.  At build time, the image will be loaded
and the indicated files/directories will be copied into the context directory
of the build process.  This is the same directory into which the source repository
content (if any) is cloned.

Image inputs are specified in the `*source*` definition of the `*BuildConfig*`:

====
[source,yaml]
----
source:
  git:
    uri: https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git
  images: <1>
  - from: <2>
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: myinputimage:latest
      namespace: mynamespace
    paths: <3>
    - destinationDir: injected/dir <4>
      sourcePath: /usr/lib/somefile.jar <5>
  - from:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: myotherinputimage:latest
      namespace: myothernamespace
    pullSecret: mysecret <6>
    paths:
    - destinationDir: injected/dir
      sourcePath: /usr/lib/somefile.jar

----

<1> An array of one or more input images and files.
<2> A reference to the image containing the files to be copied.
<3> An array of source/destination paths.
<4> The directory relative to the build root where the build process can access the file.
<5> The location of the file to be copied out of the referenced image.
<6> An optional secret provided if credentials are needed to access the input image.
====

NOTE: This feature is not supported for builds using the `*Custom*` strategy.

== Using Secrets During a Build

In some scenarios operations performed by the build require credentials to access
dependent resources, but it is undesirable for those credentials to be available
in the final application image produced by the build.

For example, you are building a NodeJS application and you set up your private
mirror for NodeJS modules. In order to download modules from that private mirror,
you have to supply a custom *_.npmrc_* file for the build that contains a URL,
username and password. For security reasons, you do not want to expose your
credentials in the application image.

While this example describes NodeJS, you can use the same approach for adding
SSL certificates into the *_/etc/ssl/certs_* directory, API keys or tokens, license
files, etc.

[[using-secrets-in-the-buildconfig]]
=== Defining Secrets in the BuildConfig

First, you have to create the `Secret` you want to use. You can do that by
executing the following command:

----
$ oc secrets new secret-npmrc .npmrc=~/.npmrc
----

This command will create a new `Secret` named *_secret-npmrc_* and store
the base64 encoded content of the *_~/.npmrc_* file in it.

Now, that you have the secret created, you can add references to `*secrets*`
into the `*source*` section in the existing `BuildConfig`:

[source,yaml]
----
source:
  git:
    uri: https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex.git
  secrets:
    secret:
      name: secret-npmrc
  type: Git
----

If you want to create a new `BuildConfig` and you want to include the secrets
in it, you can run the following command:

----
$ oc new-build openshift/nodejs-010-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex.git --build-secret secret-npmrc
----

During the build in both of these examples the *_.npmrc_* will be copied into
a directory where the source code is located. In case of the OpenShift Source-To-Image
builder images, this will be the image working directory which is set using the
`WORKDIR` instruction in the *_Dockerfile_*. If you want to specify another directory,
you can add a `*destinationDir*` into the secret definition:

[source,yaml]
----
source:
  git:
    uri: https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex.git
  secrets:
    secret:
      name: secret-npmrc
    destinationDir: /etc
  type: Git
----

You can also specify the destination directory when creating a new `BuildConfig`:

----
$ oc new-build openshift/nodejs-010-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex.git --build-secret “secret-npmrc:/etc”
----

In both cases, the *_.npmrc_* file will be added into the *_/etc_* directory of
the build environment. Note that for a
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#docker-build[Docker strategy]
the destination directory must be a relative path.

[[using-secrets-s2i-strategy]]
=== Source-to-Image Strategy

When you are using a `Source` strategy all defined source secrets will be copied
to the respective `destinationDir`. If you left `destinationDir` empty then the
secrets will be placed to the working directory of the builder image. The same
rule is used when a destination directory is a relative path - the secrets will
be placed into the paths that are relative to the image's working directory.
The `destinationDir` must exist or an error will occur. No directory paths are
created during the copy process.

Keep in mind that in the current implementation, files with the secrets are
world-writable (have `0666` permissions) and will be truncated to size zero
after execution of the *_assemble_* script. This means that the secret files will
exist in the resulting image but they will be empty for security reasons.

[[using-secrets-docker-strategy]]
=== Docker Strategy

When you are using a `Docker` strategy, you can add all defined source secrets into
your Docker image using the https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#add[ADD]
and https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy[COPY instructions]
in your *_Dockerfile_*. If you don’t specify the `destinationDir` for a secret,
then the files will be copied into the same directory in which the *_Dockerfile_*
is located. If you specify a relative path as `destinationDir`, then the secrets
will be copied into that directory, relative to your *_Dockerfile_* location.
This makes the secret files available to the Docker build operation as part of
the context directory used during the build.

Note that for security reasons, users should always remove their secrets from
the final application image. This removal should be part of the *_Dockerfile_*
itself. In that case, the secrets will not be present in the container running
from that image. However, the secrets will still exist in the image itself in
the layer where they were added.

[[using-secrets-custom-strategy]]
=== Custom Strategy

When you are using a `Custom` strategy, then all the defined source secrets will
be available inside the builder container under
*_/var/run/secrets/openshift.io/build_* directory. It is the custom build image's
responsibility to use these secrets appropriately. The `Custom` strategy also
allows secrets to be defined as described in link:#custom-secrets[Secrets]. There is
no technical difference between existing strategy secrets and the source secrets.
However, your builder image might distinguish between them and use them
differently, based on your build use case. The source secrets are always mounted
into *_/var/run/secrets/openshift.io/build_* directory or your builder can parse
the `$BUILD` environment variable which includes the full Build object serialized
into JSON format.


[[starting-a-build]]

== Starting a Build
Manually invoke a build using the following command:

----
$ oc start-build <BuildConfigName>
----

Re-run a build using the `--from-build` flag:

----
$ oc start-build --from-build=<buildName>
----

Specify the `--follow` flag to stream the build's logs in stdout:

----
$ oc start-build <BuildConfigName> --follow
----

[[canceling-a-build]]

== Canceling a Build
Manually cancel a build using the following command:

----
$ oc cancel-build <buildName>
----

[[accessing-build-logs]]

== Accessing Build Logs
To allow access to build logs, use the following command:

----
$ oc build-logs <buildName>
----

*Log Verbosity*

To enable more verbose output, pass the `*BUILD_LOGLEVEL*` environment variable
as part of the `*sourceStrategy*` or `*dockerStrategy*` in a `*BuildConfig*`:

====

----
{
  "sourceStrategy": {
    ...
    "env": [
      {
        "name": "BUILD_LOGLEVEL",
        "value": "2" <1>
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

<1> Adjust this value to the desired log level.
====

NOTE: A platform administrator can set verbosity for the entire OpenShift
instance by passing the `--loglevel` option to the `openshift start` command.
If both `--loglevel` and `BUILD_LOGLEVEL` are specified, `BUILD_LOGLEVEL` takes precedence.

Available log levels for Source builds are as follows:

[horizontal]
Level 0:: Produces output from containers running the *_assemble_* script and all encountered errors. This is the default.
Level 1:: Produces basic information about the executed process.
Level 2:: Produces very detailed information about the executed process.
Level 3:: Produces very detailed information about the executed process, and a listing of the archive contents.
Level 4:: Currently produces the same information as level 3.
Level 5:: Produces everything mentioned on previous levels and additionally provides docker push messages.

[[source-code]]

== Source Code
The source code location is one of the required parameters for the
`*BuildConfig*`. The build uses this location and fetches the source code that
is later built. The source code location definition is part of the
`*spec*` section in the `*BuildConfig*`:

====

----
{
  "source" : {
    "type" : "Git", <1>
    "git" : { <2>
      "uri": "https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world"
    },
    "contextDir": "app/dir", <3>
  },
}
----

<1> The `*type*` field describes which SCM is used to fetch your source code.
<2> The `*git*` field contains the URI to the remote Git repository of the
source code. Optionally, specify the `*ref*` field to check out a specific Git
reference. A valid `*ref*` can be a SHA1 tag or a branch name.
<3> The `*contextDir*` field allows you to override the default location inside
the source code repository where the build looks for the application source
code. If your application exists inside a sub-directory, you can override the
default location (the root folder) using this field.
====

[[build-triggers]]

== Build Triggers
When defining a `*BuildConfig*`, you can define triggers to control the
circumstances in which the `*BuildConfig*` should be run. The following build
triggers are available:

* link:#webhook-triggers[Webhook]
* link:#image-change-triggers[Image change]
* link:#config-change-triggers[Configuration change]

[[webhook-triggers]]

=== Webhook Triggers
Webhook triggers allow you to trigger a new build by sending a request to the
OpenShift API endpoint. You can define these triggers using
https://developer.github.com/webhooks/[GitHub webhooks] or Generic webhooks.

*GitHub Webhooks*

https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/[GitHub webhooks] handle the call
made by GitHub when a repository is updated. When defining the trigger, you must
specify a link:../dev_guide/secrets.html[`*secret*`] as part of the URL you supply
to GitHub when configuring the webhook. The `*secret*` ensures that only you and
your repository can trigger the build. The following example is a trigger
definition JSON within the `*BuildConfig*`:

====

----
{
  "type": "GitHub",
  "github": {
    "secret": "secret101"
  }
}
----
====

The payload URL is returned as the GitHub Webhook URL by the `describe` command
(see link:#describe-buildconfig[below]), and is structured as follows:

----
http://<openshift_api_host:port>/osapi/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/github
----

*Generic Webhooks*

Generic webhooks can be invoked from any system capable of making a web
request. As with a GitHub webhook, you must specify a `*secret*` when defining the
trigger, and the caller must provide this `*secret*` to trigger the build. The
following is an example trigger definition JSON within the `*BuildConfig*`:

====

----
{
  "type": "Generic",
  "generic": {
    "secret": "secret101"
  }
}
----
====

To set up the caller, supply the calling system with the URL of the generic
webhook endpoint for your build:

----
http://<openshift_api_host:port>/osapi/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/generic
----

The endpoint can accept an optional payload with the following format:

====

----
{
  type: 'git',
  git: {
    uri: '<url to git repository>',
    ref: '<optional git reference>',
    commit: '<commit hash identifying a specific git commit>',
    author: {
      name: '<author name>',
      email: '<author e-mail>',
    },
    committer: {
      name: '<committer name>',
      email: '<committer e-mail>',
    },
    message: '<commit message>'
  }
}
----
====

[[describe-buildconfig]]

*Displaying a BuildConfig's Webhook URLs*

Use the following command to display the webhook URLs associated with a build
configuration:

----
$ oc describe bc <name>
----

If the above command does not display any webhook URLs, then no webhook trigger
is defined for that build configuration.

[[image-change-triggers]]

=== Image Change Triggers
Image change triggers allow your build to be automatically invoked when a new
version of an upstream image is available. For example, if a build is based on
top of a RHEL image, then you can trigger that build to run any time the RHEL
image changes. As a result, the application image is always running on the
latest RHEL base image.

Configuring an image change trigger requires the following actions:

. Define an `*ImageStream*` that points to the upstream image you want to
trigger on:
+
====

----
{
  "kind": "ImageStream",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "ruby-20-centos7"
  }
}
----
====
+
This defines the image stream that is tied to a Docker image repository
located at `_<system-registry>_/_<namespace>_/ruby-20-centos7`. The
`_<system-registry>_` is defined as a service with the name `docker-registry`
running in OpenShift.

. If an image stream is the base image for the build, set the from field in the
build strategy to point to the image stream:
+
====

----
{
  "strategy": {
    "type": "Source",
    "sourceStrategy": {
      "from": {
        "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
        "name": "ruby-20-centos7:latest"
      },
    }
  }
}
----
====
+
In this case, the `*sourceStrategy*` definition is consuming the `latest` tag of
the image stream named `ruby-20-centos7` located within this namespace.

. Define a build with one or more triggers that point to image streams:
+
====

----
{
  "type": "imageChange", <1>
  "imageChange": {}
}
{
  "type": "imagechange", <2>
  "imageChange": {
     "from": {
       "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
       "name": "custom-image:latest"
     }
  }
}
----

<1> An image change trigger that monitors the `*ImageStream*` and
`*Tag*` as defined by the build strategy's `*from*` field. The `*imageChange*` part
must be empty.
<2> An image change trigger that monitors an arbitrary image stream. The `*imageChange*`
part in this case must include a `*from*` field that references the `*ImageStreamTag*` to monitor.
====

When using an image change trigger for the strategy image stream, the generated build
is supplied with an immutable Docker tag that points to the latest image corresponding
to that tag. This new image reference will be used by the strategy
when it executes for the build. For other image change triggers that do not
reference the strategy image stream, a new build will be started, but the build
strategy will not be updated with a unique image reference.

In the example above that has an image change trigger for the strategy, the resulting build will be:

====

----
{
  "strategy": {
    "type": "Source",
    "sourceStrategy": {
      "from": {
        "kind": "DockerImage",
        "name": "172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos7:immutableid"
      }
    }
  }
}
----
====

This ensures that the triggered build uses the new image that was just pushed to
the repository, and the build can be re-run any time with the same inputs.

In addition to setting the image field for all `*Strategy*` types, for custom
builds, the `OPENSHIFT_CUSTOM_BUILD_BASE_IMAGE` environment variable is checked.
If it does not exist, then it is created with the immutable image reference. If
it does exist then it is updated with the immutable image reference.

If a build is triggered due to a webhook trigger or manual request,
the build that is created uses the `*immutableid*` resolved from the
`*ImageStream*` referenced by the `*Strategy*`. This ensures that builds
are performed using consistent image tags for ease of reproduction.

[NOTE]
====
Image streams that point to Docker images in
http://docs.docker.com/v1.7/reference/api/hub_registry_spec/#docker-registry-1-0[v1
Docker registries] only trigger a build once when the image stream tag becomes
available and not on subsequent image updates. This is due to the lack of
uniquely identifiable images in v1 Docker registries.
====

[[config-change-triggers]]
=== Configuration Change Triggers
A configuration change trigger allows a build to be automatically invoked as
soon as a new `*BuildConfig*` is created. The following is an example trigger
definition JSON within the `*BuildConfig*`:

====

----
{
  "type": "ConfigChange"
}
----

====

[NOTE]
====
Configuration change triggers currently only work when creating a new
`*BuildConfig*`. In a future release, configuration change triggers will also be
able to launch a build whenever a `*BuildConfig*` is updated.
====

[[using-docker-credentials-for-pushing-and-pulling-images]]
== Using Docker Credentials for Pushing and Pulling Images

Supply the *_.dockercfg_* file with valid Docker Registry credentials in order to
push the output image into a private Docker Registry or pull the builder image
from the private Docker Registry that requires authentication. For the OpenShift
Docker Registry, you don't have to do this because `*secrets*` are generated
automatically for you by OpenShift.

The *_.dockercfg_* JSON file is found in your home directory by default and has
the following format:

====

----
{
	"https://index.docker.io/v1/": { <1>
		"auth": "YWRfbGzhcGU6R2labnRib21ifTE=", <2>
		"email": "user@example.com" <3>
	}
}
----

<1> URL of the registry.
<2> Encrypted password.
<3> Email address for the login.
====

You can define multiple Docker registry entries in this file. Alternatively, you
can also add authentication entries to this file by running the `docker login`
command. The file will be created if it does not exist. Kubernetes provides
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/design/secrets.md[`*secret*`],
which are used to store your configuration and passwords.

. Create the `*secret*` from your local *_.dockercfg_* file:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets new dockerhub ~/.dockercfg
----
====
+
This generates a JSON specification of the `*secret*` named *dockerhub* and
creates the object.

. Once the `*secret*` is created, add it to the builder service account:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets add serviceaccount/builder secrets/dockerhub
----
====

. Add a `*pushSecret*` field into the `*output*` section of the `*BuildConfig*` and
set it to the name of the `*secret*` that you created, which in the above example
is *dockerhub*:
+
====

----
{
  "spec": {
    "output": {
      "to": {
        "name": "private-image"
      },
      "pushSecret":{
        "name": "dockerhub"
      }
    }
  }
}
----
====

. Pull the builder Docker image from a private Docker registry by specifying the
`*pullSecret*` field, which is part of the build strategy definition:
+
====

----
{
  "strategy": {
    "sourceStrategy": {
      "from": {
        "kind": "DockerImage",
        "name": "docker.io/user/private_repository"
       },
       "pullSecret": {
        "name": "dockerhub"
       },
    },
    "type": "Source"
  }
}
----
====
