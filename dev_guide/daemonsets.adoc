== Overview

A daemonset can be used to run replicas of a pod on specific or all nodes in an
{product-title} cluster.

Use daemonsets to create shared storage, run a logging pod on every node in
your cluster, or deploy a monitoring agent on every node.

For security reasons, only cluster administrators can create daemonsets.
(xref:../admin_guide/manage_rbac.adoc#admin-guide-granting-users-daemonset-permissions[Granting Users Daemonset Permissions.])

For more information on daemonsets, see the link:http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/daemons/[Kubernetes documentation].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Daemonset scheduling is incompatible with project's default node selector.
If you fail to disable it, the daemonset gets restricted by merging with the
default node selector. This results in frequent pod recreates on the nodes that
got unselected by the merged node selector, which in turn puts unwanted load on
the cluster.

Therefore,

* Before you start using daemonsets, disable the default project-wide
xref:../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#using-node-selectors[node selector]
in your namespace, by setting the namespace annotation `openshift.io/node-selector` to an empty string:

----
# oc patch namespace myproject -p \
    '{"metadata": {"annotations": {"openshift.io/node-selector": ""}}}'
----

* If you are creating a new project, overwrite the default node selector using
`oc adm new-project --node-selector=""`.

== Creating Daemonsets

When creating daemonsets, the `*nodeSelector*` field is used to indicate the
nodes on which the daemonset should deploy replicas.

. Define the daemonset yaml file:
+
====
----
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: hello-daemonset
spec:
  selector:
      matchLabels:
        name: hello-daemonset <1>
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: hello-daemonset <2>
    spec:
      nodeSelector: <3>
        type: infra
      containers:
      - image: openshift/hello-openshift
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: registry
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
        resources: {}
        terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
      serviceAccount: default
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 10
----
<1> The label selector that determines which pods belong to the daemonset.
<2> The pod template's label selector. Must match the label selector above.
<3> The node selector that determines on which nodes pod replicas should be deployed.
====

. Create the daemonset object:
+
----
oc create -f daemonset.yaml
----

. To verify that the pods were created, and that each node has a pod replica:
+
.. Find the daemonset pods:
+
====
----
$ oc get pods
hello-daemonset-cx6md   1/1       Running   0          2m
hello-daemonset-e3md9   1/1       Running   0          2m
----
====
+
.. View the pods to verify the pod has been placed onto the node:
+
====
----
$ oc describe pod/hello-daemonset-cx6md|grep Node
Node:        openshift-node01.hostname.com/10.14.20.134
$ oc describe pod/hello-daemonset-e3md9|grep Node
Node:        openshift-node02.hostname.com/10.14.20.137
----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, updating a daemonset's pod template does not affect existing pod
replicas. Moreover, if you delete a daemonset and then create a new daemonset
with a different template but the same label selector, it will recognize any
existing pod replicas as having matching labels and thus will not update them or
create new replicas despite a mismatch in the pod template.

To update a daemonset, force new pod replicas to be created by deleting the old
replicas or nodes.
