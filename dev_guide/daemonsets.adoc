== Overview

Daemonsets are used to run a copy of a pod on specific or all nodes in an
{product-title} environment upon node creation.

Use daemonsets to create shared storage, run a logging pod on every node in
your cluster, or deploy a monitoring agent on every node.

For more information on daemonsets, see the link:http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/daemons/[Kubernetes documentation].

== Creating Daemonsets

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before creating daemonsets, ensure you have been
xref:../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.adoc#admin-guide-granting-users-daemonset-permissions[given
the required role by your {product-title} administrator].
====

When creating Daemonsets, the `*nodeSelector*` field is used to indicate the
nodes on which the Daemonset should deploy onto.

. Define the daemonset yaml file:
+
====
----
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: hello-daemonset
spec:
  selector:
      matchLabels:
        name: hello-daemonset <1>
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: hello-daemonset <2>
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: openshift/hello-openshift
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: registry
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
        resources: {}
        terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
      serviceAccount: default
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 10
----
<1> The pod template.
<2> The node selector indicating the appropriate labels. Must match the pod template above.
====

. Create the daemonset object:
+
----
oc create -f daemonset.yaml
----

. To verify that the pods were created, and that each node has a copy of the
pod:
+
.. Find the daemonset pods:
+
====
----
$ oc get pods
hello-daemonset-cx6md   1/1       Running   0          2m
hello-daemonset-e3md9   1/1       Running   0          2m
----
====
+
.. View the pods to verify the pod has been placed onto the node:
+
====
----
$ oc describe pod/hello-daemonset-cx6md|grep Node
Node:        openshift-node01.hostname.com/10.14.20.134
$ oc describe pod/hello-daemonset-e3md9|grep Node
Node:        openshift-node02.hostname.com/10.14.20.137
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, you cannot update a daemonset. You can delete a daemonset, but
creating and using a new daemonset with a different template will recognize the
existing pod as having matching labels dispite a mismatch in the pod template.

To update a daemonset, force a new pod to be created by deleting the pod or
node.
