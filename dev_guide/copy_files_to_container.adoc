== Overview

You can use the CLI to copy local files to or from a remote directory in a container.  This is a useful tool for copying database archives to and from your pods for backup and restore purposes.  It can also be used to copy source code changes into a running pod for development debugging, when the running pod supports hot reload of source files.

[[copying-basic-usage]]
== Basic Usage

Support for copying local files to or from a container is built into
xref:../cli_reference/index.adoc#cli-reference-index[the CLI]:

----
$ oc rsync <source> <destination> [-c <container>]
----

For example, to copy a local directory to a pod directory:

====
----
$ oc rsync /home/user/source devpod1234:/src
----
====

Or to copy a pod directory to a local directory:

====
----
$ oc rsync devpod1234:/src /home/user/source
----
====

== Backing Up and Restoring Databases

Use `oc rsync` to copy database archives from an existing database container
to a new database container's persistent volume directory.

[NOTE]
====
MySQL is used in the example below. Replace `mysql|MYSQL` with `pgsql|PGSQL` or
`mongodb|MONGODB` and refer to
xref:../dev_guide/migrating_applications/index.adoc#dev-guide-migrating-applications[the
migration guide] to find the exact commands for each of our supported database
images. The example assumes an existing database container.
====


. Back up the existing database from a running database pod:
+
----
$ oc rsh <existing db container>
# mkdir /var/lib/mysql/data/db_archive_dir
# mysqldump --skip-lock-tables -h ${MYSQL_SERVICE_HOST} -P ${MYSQL_SERVICE_PORT:-3306} \
  -u ${MYSQL_USER} --password="$MYSQL_PASSWORD" --all-databases > /var/lib/mysql/data/db_archive_dir/all.sql
# exit
----

. Remote sync the archive file to your local machine:
+
----
$ oc rsync <existing db container with db archive>:/var/lib/mysql/data/db_archive_dir /tmp/.
----

. Start a second MySQL pod into which to load the database archive file created above.
The MySQL pod must have a unique `DATABASE_SERVICE_NAME`.
+
====
----
$ oc new-app mysql-persistent \
  -p MYSQL_USER=<archived mysql username> \
  -p MYSQL_PASSWORD=<archived mysql password> \
  -p MYSQL_DATABASE=<archived database name> \
  -p DATABASE_SERVICE_NAME='mysql2' <1>
$ oc rsync /tmp/db_archive_dir new_dbpod1234:/var/lib/mysql/data
$ oc rsh new_dbpod1234
----
<1> `mysql` is the default. In this example, `mysql2` is created.
====

. Use the appropriate commands to restore the database in the new database
 container from the copied database archive directory:
+
.MySQL
----
$ cd /var/lib/mysql/data/db_archive_dir
$ mysql -u root
$ source all.sql
$ GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <dbname>.* TO '<your username>'@'localhost'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
$ cd ../; rm -rf /var/lib/mysql/data/db_backup_dir
----
+
You now have two MySQL database pods running in your project with the archived
database.

[[copying-requirements]]
== Requirements

The `oc rsync` command uses the local `rsync` command if present on the client's
machine. This requires that the remote container also have the `rsync` command.

If `rsync` is not found locally or in the remote container, then a tar archive
will be created locally and sent to the container where `tar` will be used to
extract the files. If `tar` is not available in the remote container, then the
copy will fail.

The `tar` copy method does not provide the same functionality as `rsync`. For
example, `rsync` creates the destination directory if it does not exist and will
only send files that are different between the source and the destination.

[NOTE]
====
In Windows, the `cwRsync` client should be installed and added to the PATH for
use with the `oc rsync` command.
====

[[specifying-the-copy-source]]
== Specifying the Copy Source

The source argument of the `oc rsync` command must point to either a local
directory or a pod directory. Individual files are not currently supported.

When specifying a pod directory the directory name must be prefixed with the pod
name:

----
<pod name>:<dir>
----

Just as with standard `rsync`, if the directory name ends in a path separator (`/`),
only the contents of the directory are copied to the destination. Otherwise, the
directory itself is copied to the destination with all its contents.

[[specifying-the-copy-destination]]
== Specifying the Copy Destination

The destination argument of the `oc rsync` command must point to a directory. If
the directory does not exist, but `rsync` is used for copy, the directory is
created for you.

[[deleting-file-at-the-destination]]
== Deleting Files at the Destination

The `--delete` flag may be used to delete any files in the remote directory that
are not in the local directory.

[[continuous-syncing-on-file-change]]
== Continuous Syncing on File Change

Using the `--watch` option causes the command to monitor the source path for any
file system changes, and synchronizes changes when they occur. With this
argument, the command runs forever.

Synchronization occurs after short quiet periods to ensure a
rapidly changing file system does not result in continuous synchronization
calls.

When using the `--watch` option, the behavior is effectively the same as
manually invoking `oc rsync` repeatedly, including any arguments normally passed
to `oc rsync`. Therefore, you can control the behavior via the same flags used
with manual invocations of `oc rsync`, such as `--delete`.

[[advanced-rsync-features]]
== Advanced Rsync Features

The `oc rsync` command exposes fewer command line options than standard `rsync`.
In the case that you wish to use a standard `rsync` command line option which is
not available in `oc rsync` (for example the `--exclude-from=FILE` option), it
may be possible to use standard `rsync` 's `--rsh` (`-e`) option or `RSYNC_RSH`
environment variable as a workaround, as follows:

----
$ rsync --rsh='oc rsh' --exclude-from=FILE SRC POD:DEST
----

or:

----
$ export RSYNC_RSH='oc rsh'
$ rsync --exclude-from=FILE SRC POD:DEST
----

Both of the above examples configure standard `rsync` to use `oc rsh` as its
remote shell program to enable it to connect to the remote pod, and are an
alternative to running `oc rsync`.
