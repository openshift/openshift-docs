== Overview

Events in {product-title} are modeled based on events that happen to API objects
in an {product-title} cluster. Events allow {product-title} to record
information about real-world events in a resource-agnostic manner. They also
allow developers and administrators to consume information about system
components in a unified way.

[[viewing-events-with-the-cli]]
== Viewing Events with the CLI

You can get a list of events in a given project using the following command:

----
$ oc get events [-n <project>]
----

[[viewing-events-in-the-web-console]]
== Viewing Events in the Console

You can see events in your project from the web console from the *Browse* ->
*Events* page. Many other objects, such as pods and deployments, have their own
*Events* tab as well, which shows events related to that object.

== Out-of-band interface

// NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

{product-title} administrators can consume events directly via an out-of-band interface instead
of querying the API server. This can be helpful, for example, if the API server cannot be contacted by a system component in order to record events.

This section will be expanded as more information becomes available

// TODO: out-of-band example
