== Overview

Events in {product-title} are modeled based on events that happen to API objects
in an {product-title} cluster. Events allow {product-title} to record
information about real-world events in a resource-agnostic manner. They also
allow developers and administrators to consume information about system
components in a unified way.

[[viewing-events-with-the-cli]]
== Viewing Events with the CLI

You can get a list of events in a given project using the following command:

----
$ oc get events [-n <project>]
----

[[viewing-events-in-the-web-console]]
== Viewing Events in the Console

You can see events in your project from the web console from the *Browse* ->
*Events* page. Many other objects, such as pods and deployments, have their own
*Events* tab as well, which shows events related to that object.

[[failure-notifications]]
== Failure Notifications

For each of your projects, you can choose to receive
xref:../dev_guide/notifications.adoc#dev-guide-notifications[email notifications
about various failures], including dead or failed deployments, dead builds, and
dead or failed persistent volume claims (PVCs).
