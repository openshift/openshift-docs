== Overview

A `ResourceQuota` defines constraints that limit aggregrate resource consumption
per project.  It can limit the quantity of objects that can be created in a project
by type, as well as the total amount of link:compute_resources.html[compute resources]
that may be consumed by resources in that project.

== Resources managed by quota

The following describes the set of resources that may be managed by a `ResourceQuota`.

.Resources managed by quota
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Resource Name |Description

|`configmaps`
|Total number of configmaps

|`cpu`
|Across all pods in a non-terminal state, the sum of cpu requests cannot exceed this value.

|`memory`
|Across all pods in a non-terminal state, the sum of memory requests cannot exceed this value.

|`requests.cpu`
|Across all pods in a non-terminal state, the sum of cpu requests cannot exceed this value.

|`requests.memory`
|Across all pods in a non-terminal state, the sum of memory requests cannot exceed this value.

|`limits.cpu`
|Across all pods in a non-terminal state, the sum of cpu limits cannot exceed this value.

|`limits.memory`
|Across all pods in a non-terminal state, the sum of memory limits cannot exceed this value.

|`configmaps`
|The total number of config maps that can exist in the project.

|`pods`
|The total number of pods in a non-terminal state that can exist in the project.  A pod is in a terminal state if `status.phase in (Failed, Succeeded)` is true.

|`replicationcontrollers`
|The total number of replication controllers that can exist in the project.

|`resourcequotas`
|The total number of resource quotas that can exist in the project.

|`services`
|The total number of services that can exist in the project.

|`secrets`
|The total number of secrets that can exist in the project.

|`persistentvolumeclaims`
|The total number of persistent volume claims that can exist in the project.

== Quota Scopes

Each quota can have an associated set of scopes.  A quota will only
measure usage for a resource if it matches the intersection of enumerated
scopes.

Adding a scope to a quota limits the number of resources it supports
to those that pertain to the scope.  Specifying a resource on the quota outside
of the allowed set would result in a validation error.

.Quota scopes
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Scope |Description

|`Terminating`
|Match pods where `spec.activeDeadlineSeconds >= 0`

|`NotTerminating`
|Match pods where `spec.activeDeadlineSeconds is nil`

|`BestEffort`
|Match pods that have best effort quality of service for either `cpu` or `memory`.

|`NotBestEffort`
|Match pods that do not have best effort quality of service for `cpu` and `memory`.
|===

A `BestEffort` scope restricts a quota to limit the following resources:

1. pods 

A `Terminating`, `NotTerminating`, and `NotBestEffort` scope restricts a quota to tracking the following resources:

1. `pods`
2. `memory`, `requests.memory`, `limits.memory`
3. `cpu`, `requests.cpu`, `limits.cpu`

== Quota Enforcement

After a project quota is first created, the project restricts the ability
to create any new resources that may violate a quota constraint until it has
calculated updated usage statistics.

Once a quota is created and usage statistics are up-to-date, the project accepts
the creation of new content. When you create or modify resources, your quota
usage is incremented immediately upon the request to create or modify the
resource. When you delete a resource, your quota use is decremented during the
next full recalculation of quota statistics for the project. When you delete
resources, a link:#configuring_quota_sync_period[configurable amount of time]
determines how long it takes to reduce quota usage statistics to their current
observed system value.

If project modifications exceed a quota usage limit, the server denies the
action, and an appropriate error message is returned to the end-user explaining
the quota constraint violated, and what their currently observed usage stats are
in the system.

=== Compute Resources: Requests vs Limits

When allocating compute resources, each container may specify a request and a limit value
for either CPU or memory.  The quota can be configured to quota either value.  If the quota
has a value specified for `requests.cpu` or `requests.memory`, then it will require that 
every incoming container makes an explicit request for those resources.  If the quota has a 
value specified for `limits.cpu` or `limits.memory`, then it will require that every incoming
container specifies an explicit limit for those resources.

== Create a Quota

To apply a quota to a project:

----
$ oc create -f resource-quota.json
----

== View a Quota

To view usage statistics related to any hard limits defined in your quota:

----
$ oc get quota
NAME
quota
$ oc describe quota quota
Name:                         quota

[[configuring_quota_sync_period]]

== Configuring the Quota Synchronization Period

When a set of resources are deleted, the synchronization timeframe of resources
is determined by the `*resource-quota-sync-period*` setting in the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file. Before your quota usage is
restored, you may encounter problems when attempting to reuse the resources.
Change the `*resource-quota-sync-period*` setting to have the set of resources
regenerate at the desired amount of time (in seconds) and for the resources to
be available again:

====
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  apiLevels:
  - v1beta3
  - v1
  apiServerArguments: null
  controllerArguments:
    resource-quota-sync-period:
      - "10s"
----
====

Adjusting the regeneration time can be helpful for creating resources and
determining resource usage when automation is used.

[NOTE]
====
The `*resource-quota-sync-period*` setting is designed to balance system
performance. Reducing the sync period can result in a heavy load on
the master.

== Accounting for Quota in Deployment Configurations

If a quota has been defined for your project, see link:../dev_guide/deployments.html#deployment-resources[Deployment Resources] for considerations on any deployment configurations.
