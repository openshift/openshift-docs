== Overview

A *ResourceQuota* object enumerates hard resource usage limits per project. It
limits the total number of a particular type of object that may be created in
a project, and the total amount of
link:compute_resources.html[compute resources]
that may be consumed by resources in that project.

== Usage Limits

The following describes the set of limits that may be enforced by a
*ResourceQuota*.

.Usage limits
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Resource Name |Description

|`configmaps`
|Total number of configmaps

|`cpu`
|Total requested cpu usage across all containers

|`memory`
|Total requested memory usage across all containers

|`openshift.io/imagesize` [[imagesize]]<<zero,*>>
|Maximum size of a single image stored in an internal registry

|`openshift.io/imagestreamsize` [[imagestreamsize]]<<zero,*>>
|Maximum size of image stream's images stored in an internal registry

|`openshift.io/projectimagessize`
|Maximum size of all the project's images stored in an internal registry

|`pods`
|Total number of pods

|`replicationcontrollers`
|Total number of replication controllers

|`resourcequotas`
|Total number of resource quotas

|`services`
|Total number of services

|`secrets`
|Total number of secrets

|`persistentvolumeclaims`
|Total number of persistent volume claims
|===

[[zero]]<<imagesize,*>> The resource is not scoped to a project. Thus it will
always have usage equal to zero.

== Quota Enforcement

After a project quota is first created, the project restricts the ability
to create any new resources that may violate a quota constraint until it has
calculated updated usage statistics.

Once a quota is created and usage statistics are up-to-date, the project accepts
the creation of new content. When you create or modify resources, your quota
usage is incremented immediately upon the request to create or modify the
resource. When you delete a resource, your quota use is decremented during the
next full recalculation of quota statistics for the project. When you delete
resources, a link:#configuring_quota_sync_period[configurable amount of time]
determines how long it takes to reduce quota usage statistics to their current
observed system value.

If project modifications exceed a quota usage limit, the server denies the
action, and an appropriate error message is returned to the end-user explaining
the quota constraint violated, and what their currently observed usage stats are
in the system.

=== Compute Resources: Requests vs Limits

When allocating compute resources, each container may specify a request and a limit value for either CPU or memory.  The quota tracking system will only cost the request value against the quota usage.  If a resource is tracked by quota, and no request value is provided, the associated entity is rejected as part of admission into the cluster.

For an example, consider the following scenarios relative to tracking quota on CPU:

.Quota tracking based on container requests
[cols="3a,3a,3a,3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Pod |Container |Requests[CPU] |Limits[CPU] |Result

|pod-x
|a
|100m
|500m
|The quota usage is incremented 100m

|pod-y
|b
|100m
|none
|The quota usage is incremented 100m

|pod-y
|c
|none
|500m
|The quota usage is incremented 500m since request will default to limit.

|pod-z
|d
|none
|none
|The pod is rejected since it does not enumerate a request.

|===

The rationale for charging quota usage for the requested amount of a resource versus the limit is the belief that a user should only be charged for what they are scheduled against in the cluster.

As a consequence, the user is able to spread its usage of a resource across multiple tiers of service. Let's demonstrate this via an example with a 4 cpu quota.

The quota may be allocated as follows:

.Quota with Burstable resources
[cols="3a,3a,3a,3a,3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Pod |Container |Requests[CPU] |Limits[CPU] |Quality of Service Tier |Quota Usage

|pod-x
|a
|1
|4
|Burstable
|1

|pod-y
|b
|2
|2
|Guaranteed
|2

|pod-z
|c
|1
|3
|Burstable
|1

|===

The user is restricted from using *BestEffort* CPU containers, but at any point in time, the containers on the node may consume up to 9 CPU cores over a given time period if there is no contention on the node because it
has **Burstable** containers.  If one wants to restrict the ratio between the request and limit, it is encouraged that the user define a `*LimitRange*` with `*MaxLimitRequestRatio*` to control burst out behavior. This would in effect, let an administrator keep the difference between request and limit more in line with tracked usage if desired.

== Create a Quota

To apply a quota to a project:

----
$ oc create -f resource-quota.json
----

== View a Quota

To view usage statistics related to any hard limits defined in your quota:

----
$ oc get quota

[[configuring_quota_sync_period]]

== Configuring the Quota Synchronization Period

When a set of resources are deleted, the synchronization timeframe of resources
is determined by the `*resource-quota-sync-period*` setting in the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file. Before your quota usage is
restored, you may encounter problems when attempting to reuse the resources.
Change the `*resource-quota-sync-period*` setting to have the set of resources
regenerate at the desired amount of time (in seconds) and for the resources to
be available again:

====
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  apiLevels:
  - v1beta3
  - v1
  apiServerArguments: null
  controllerArguments:
    resource-quota-sync-period:
      - "10s"
----
====

Adjusting the regeneration time can be helpful for creating resources and
determining resource usage when automation is used.

[NOTE]
====
The `*resource-quota-sync-period*` setting is designed to balance system
performance. Reducing the sync period can result in a heavy load on
the master.

== Accounting for Quota in Deployment Configurations

If a quota has been defined for your project, see link:../dev_guide/deployments.html#deployment-resources[Deployment Resources] for considerations on any deployment configurations.
