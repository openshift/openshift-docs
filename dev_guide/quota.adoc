== Overview

A *ResourceQuota* object enumerates hard resource usage limits per project. It
limits the total number of a particular type of object that may be created in
a project, and the total amount of compute resources that may be consumed by
resources in that project.

== Usage Limits

The following describes the set of limits that may be enforced by a
*ResourceQuota*.

.Usage limits
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Resource Name |Description

|`cpu`
|Total cpu usage across all containers

|`memory`
|Total memory usage across all containers

|`pods`
|Total number of pods

|`replicationcontrollers`
|Total number of replication controllers

|`resourcequotas`
|Total number of resource quotas

|`services`
|Total number of services

|`secrets`
|Total number of secrets

|`persistentvolumeclaims`
|Total number of persistent volume claims
|===

== Quota Enforcement

After a project quota is first created, the project restricts the ability
to create any new resources that may violate a quota constraint until it has
calculated updated usage statistics.

Once a quota is created and usage statistics are up-to-date, the project accepts
the creation of new content. When you create or modify resources, your quota
usage is incremented immediately upon the request to create or modify the
resource. When you delete a resource, your quota use is decremented during the
next full recalculation of quota statistics for the project. When you delete
resources, a link:#configuring_quota_sync_period[configurable amount of time]
determines how long it takes to reduce quota usage statistics to their current
observed system value.

If project modifications exceed a quota usage limit, the server denies the
action, and an appropriate error message is returned to the end-user explaining
the quota constraint violated, and what their currently observed usage stats are
in the system.

== Sample Resource Quota File

resource-quota.json
====
----
{
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "kind": "ResourceQuota",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "quota" <1>
  },
  "spec": {
    "hard": {
      "memory": "1Gi", <2>
      "cpu": "20", <3>

      "services": "5", <5>
      "replicationcontrollers":"5", <6>
      "resourcequotas":"1" <7>
    }
  }
}
----
<1> The name of this quota document
<2> The total amount of memory consumed across all containers may not exceed 1Gi.
<3> The total number of cpu usage consumed across all containers may not exceed 20 Kubernetes compute units.
<4> The total number of pods in the project
<5> The total number of services in the project

== Create a Quota

To apply a quota to a project:

----
$ oc create -f resource-quota.json
----

== View a Quota

To view usage statistics related to any hard limits defined in your quota:

----
$ oc get quota
NAME
quota
$ oc describe quota quota
Name:                   quota
Resource                Used    Hard
--------                ----    ----
cpu                     5       20
memory                  500Mi   1Gi
pods                    5       10
replicationcontrollers  5       5
resourcequotas          1       1
services                3       5

== Configuring the Quota Synchronization Period

When a set of resources are deleted, the synchronization timeframe of resources
is determined by the `*resource-quota-sync-period*` setting in the
*_/etc/openshift/master/master-config.yaml_* file. Before your quota usage is
restored, you may encounter problems when attempting to reuse the resources.
Change the `*resource-quota-sync-period*` setting to have the set of resources
regenerate at the desired amount of time (in seconds) and for the resources to
be available again:

====
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  apiLevels:
  - v1beta3
  - v1
  apiServerArguments: null
  controllerArguments:
    resource-quota-sync-period:
      - "10s"
----
====

Adjusting the regeneration time can be helpful for creating resources and
determining resource usage when automation is used.

[NOTE]
====
The `*resource-quota-sync-period*` setting is designed to balance system
performance. Reducing the sync period can result in a heavy load on
the master.
