== Overview

{product-title} deployments provide fine-grained management over common
user applications. They are described using three separate API objects:

- A deployment configuration, which describes the desired state of a particular
component of the application as a pod template.
- One or more replication controllers, which contain a point-in-time record of the
state of a deployment configuration as a pod template.
- One or more pods, which represent an instance of a particular version of an
application.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Users do not need to manipulate replication controllers or pods owned
by deployment configurations. The deployment system ensures changes to
deployment configurations are propagated appropriately. If the existing
deployment strategies are not suited for your use case and you have the
need to run manual steps during the lifecycle of your deployment, then you
should consider creating a xref:custom-strategy[custom strategy].
====

When you create a deployment configuration, a replication controller is created
representing the deployment configuration's pod template. If the deployment
configuration changes, a new replication controller is created with the latest
pod template, and a deployment process runs to scale down the old replication
controller and scale up the new replication controller.

Instances of your application are automatically added and removed from both
service load balancers and routers as they are created. As long as your
application supports xref:graceful-termination[graceful shutdown] when it
receives the *TERM* signal, you can ensure that running user connections are
given a chance to complete normally.

Features provided by the deployment system:

- A xref:creating-a-deployment-configuration[deployment configuration], which is a
template for running applications.
- xref:triggers[Triggers] that drive automated deployments in response to events.
- User-customizable xref:strategies[strategies] to transition from the previous
version to the new version. A strategy runs inside a pod commonly referred as
the deployment process.
- A set of xref:lifecycle-hooks[hooks] for executing custom behavior in different
points during the lifecycle of a deployment.
- Versioning of your application in order to support
xref:rolling-back-a-deployment[rollbacks] either manually or automatically in
case of deployment failure.
- Manual replication xref:scaling[scaling] and
xref:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.adoc#dev-guide-pod-autoscaling[autoscaling].


[[creating-a-deployment-configuration]]
== Creating a Deployment Configuration

Deployment configurations are `deploymentConfig` {product-title} API resources
which can be managed with the `oc` command like any other resource. The
following is an example of a `deploymentConfig` resource:

====

[source,yaml]
----
kind: "DeploymentConfig"
apiVersion: "v1"
metadata:
  name: "frontend"
spec:
  template: <1>
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: "frontend"
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: "helloworld"
          image: "openshift/origin-ruby-sample"
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
              protocol: "TCP"
  replicas: 5 <2>
  triggers:
    - type: "ConfigChange" <3>
    - type: "ImageChange" <4>
      imageChangeParams:
        automatic: true
        containerNames:
          - "helloworld"
        from:
          kind: "ImageStreamTag"
          name: "origin-ruby-sample:latest"
  strategy: <5>
    type: "Rolling"
  paused: false <6>
  revisionHistoryLimit: 2 <7>
  minReadySeconds: 0 <8>

----

<1> The pod template of the `frontend` deployment configuration describes a simple Ruby application.
<2> There will be 5 replicas of `frontend`.
<3> A xref:config-change-trigger[configuration change trigger] causes a new replication controller to be created any time the pod template changes.
<4> An xref:image-change-trigger[image change trigger] trigger causes a new replication controller to be
created each time a new version of the `origin-ruby-sample:latest` image stream tag is available.
<5> The xref:rolling-strategy[Rolling strategy] is the default way of deploying your pods. May be omitted.
<6> Pause a deployment configuration. This disables the functionality of all triggers and allows for multiple changes on the pod template before actually rolling it out.
<7> Revision history limit is the limit of old replication controllers you want to keep around for rolling back. May be omitted. If omitted, old replication controllers will not be cleaned up.
<8> Minimum seconds to wait (after the readiness checks succeed) for a pod to be considered available. The default value is 0.
====

[[start-deployment]]
== Starting a Deployment

You can start a new deployment process manually using the web console, or from
the CLI:

----
$ oc rollout latest dc/<name>
----

[NOTE]
====
If a deployment process is already in progress, the command will display a
message and a new replication controller will not be deployed.
====

[[viewing-a-deployment]]

== Viewing a Deployment

To get basic information about all the available revisions of your application:

----
$ oc rollout history dc/<name>
----

This will show details about all recently created replication controllers for
the provided deployment configuration, including any currently running deployment
process.

You can view details specific to a revision by using the `--revision` flag:

----
$ oc rollout history dc/<name> --revision=1
----

For more detailed information about a deployment configuration and its latest revision:

----
$ oc describe dc <name>
----

[NOTE]
====
The
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#project-overviews[web
console] shows deployments in the *Browse* tab.
====

[[canceling-a-deployment]]

== Canceling a Deployment

To cancel a running or stuck deployment process:

----
$ oc deploy --cancel dc/<name>
----

[WARNING]
====
The cancellation is a best-effort operation, and may take some time to complete.
The replication controller may partially or totally complete its deployment
before the cancellation is effective. When canceled, the deployment
configuration will be automatically rolled back by scaling up the previous
running replication controller.
====

[[retrying-a-deployment]]

== Retrying a Deployment

If the current revision of your deployment configuration failed to deploy, you can
restart the deployment process with:

----
$ oc deploy --retry dc/<name>
----

If the latest revision of it was deployed successfully, the command will display a
message and the deployment process will not be retried.

[NOTE]
====
Retrying a deployment restarts the deployment process and does not create a new
deployment revision. The restarted replication controller will have the same configuration
it had when it failed.
====

[[rolling-back-a-deployment]]
== Rolling Back a Deployment

Rollbacks revert an application back to a previous revision and can be
performed using the REST API, the CLI, or the web console.

To rollback to the last successful deployed revision of your configuration:

----
$ oc rollout undo dc/<name>
----

The deployment configuration's template will be reverted to match the deployment
revision specified in the undo command, and a new replication controller will be
started. If no revision is specified with `--to-revision`, then the last
successfully deployed revision will be used.

Image change triggers on the deployment configuration are disabled as part of
the rollback to prevent accidentally starting a new deployment process soon after
the rollback is complete. To re-enable the image change triggers:

----
$ oc set triggers dc/<name> --auto
----

[NOTE]
====
Deployment configurations also support automatically rolling back to the
last successful revision of the configuration in case the latest deployment
process fails. In that case, the latest template that failed to deploy stays
intact by the system and it is up to users to fix their configurations.
====

[[executing-commands-inside-a-container-deployments]]
== Executing Commands Inside a Container

You can add a command to a container, which modifies the container's startup
behavior by overruling the image's `ENTRYPOINT`. This is different from a
xref:pod-based-lifecycle-hook[lifecycle hook],
which instead can be run once per deployment at a specified time.

Add the `command` parameters to the `spec` field of the deployment
configuration. You can also add an `args` field, which modifies the
`command` (or the `ENTRYPOINT` if `command` does not exist).

====
----
...
spec:
  containers:
    -
    name: <container_name>
    image: 'image'
    command:
      - '<command>'
    args:
      - '<argument_1>'
      - '<argument_2>'
      - '<argument_3>'
...
----
====

For example, to execute the `java` command with the `-jar` and
*_/opt/app-root/springboots2idemo.jar_* arguments:

====
----
...
spec:
  containers:
    -
    name: example-spring-boot
    image: 'image'
    command:
      - java
    args:
      - '-jar'
      - /opt/app-root/springboots2idemo.jar
...
----
====

[[viewing-deployment-logs]]

== Viewing Deployment Logs

To stream the logs of the latest revision for a given deployment configuration:

----
$ oc logs -f dc/<name> --follow
----

If the latest revision is running or failed, `oc logs` will return the logs of
the process that is responsible for deploying your pods. If it is successful,
`oc logs` will return the logs from a pod of your application.

You can also view logs from older failed deployment processes, if and only if
these processes (old replication controllers and their deployer pods) exist and
have not been pruned or deleted manually:

----
$ oc logs --version=1 dc/<name>
----

For more options on retrieving logs see:

----
$ oc logs --help
----

[[triggers]]
== Triggers

A deployment configuration can contain triggers, which drive the creation of
new deployment processes in response to events inside the cluster.

[WARNING]
====
If no triggers are defined on a deployment configuration, a `ConfigChange`
trigger is added by default. If triggers are defined as an empty field, deployments
must be xref:start-deployment[started manually].
====

[[config-change-trigger]]
=== Configuration Change Trigger

The `ConfigChange` trigger results in a new replication controller whenever
changes are detected in the pod template of the deployment configuration.

[NOTE]
====
If a `ConfigChange` trigger is defined on a deployment configuration,
the first replication controller will be automatically created soon after
the deployment configuration itself is created and it is not paused.
====


.A ConfigChange Trigger
====

[source,yaml]
----
triggers:
  - type: "ConfigChange"
----
====

[[image-change-trigger]]
=== ImageChange Trigger

The `ImageChange` trigger results in a new replication controller whenever the
content of an image stream tag changes (when a new version of the image is
pushed).

.An ImageChange Trigger
====
[source,yaml]
----
triggers:
  - type: "ImageChange"
    imageChangeParams:
      automatic: true <1>
      from:
        kind: "ImageStreamTag"
        name: "origin-ruby-sample:latest"
        namespace: "myproject"
      containerNames:
        - "helloworld"
----
<1> If the `imageChangeParams.automatic` field is set to `false`,
the trigger is disabled.
====

With the above example, when the `latest` tag value of the *origin-ruby-sample*
image stream changes and the new image value differs from the current image
specified in the deployment configuration's *helloworld* container, a new
replication controller is created using the new image for the *helloworld* container.

[NOTE]
====
If an `ImageChange` trigger is defined on a deployment configuration (with a
`ConfigChange` trigger and `automatic=false`, or with `automatic=true`) and the
`ImageStreamTag` pointed by the `ImageChange` trigger does not exist yet, then
the initial deployment process will automatically start as soon as an image is
imported or pushed by a build to the `ImageStreamTag`.
====

[[deployment-triggers-using-the-command-line]]
==== Using the Command Line

The `oc set triggers` command can be used to set a deployment trigger for a
deployment configuration. For the example above, you can set the
`ImageChangeTrigger` by using the following command:

----
$ oc set triggers dc/frontend --from-image=myproject/origin-ruby-sample:latest -c helloworld
----

For more information, see:

----
$ oc set triggers --help
----

[[strategies]]
== Strategies

A deployment strategy determines the deployment process, and is defined by the
deployment configuration. Each application has different requirements for
availability (and other considerations) during deployments. {product-title}
provides strategies to support a variety of deployment scenarios.

A deployment strategy uses
xref:../dev_guide/application_health.adoc#dev-guide-application-health[readiness
checks] to determine if a new pod is ready for use. If a readiness check fails,
the deployment configuration will retry to run the pod until it times out. The
default timeout is `10m`, a value set in `TimeoutSeconds` in
`dc.spec.strategy.*params`.

The xref:rolling-strategy[Rolling strategy] is the default strategy used if
no strategy is specified on a deployment configuration.

[[rolling-strategy]]
=== Rolling Strategy

A rolling deployment slowly replaces instances of the previous version of an
application with instances of the new version of the application. A rolling
deployment typically waits for new pods to become *ready* via a *readiness
check* before scaling down the old components. If a significant issue occurs,
the rolling deployment can be aborted.

[[canary-deployments]]
=== Canary Deployments

All rolling deployments in {product-title} are _canary_ deployments; a new
version (the canary) is tested  before all of the old instances are replaced. If
the readiness check never succeeds, the canary instance is removed and the
deployment configuration will be automatically rolled back. The readiness check
is part of the application code, and may be as sophisticated as necessary to
ensure the new instance is ready to be used. If you need to implement more
complex checks of the application (such as sending real user workloads to the
new instance), consider implementing a custom deployment or using a blue-green
deployment strategy.

[[when-to-use-a-rolling-deployment]]
=== When to Use a Rolling Deployment

* When you want to take no downtime during an application update.
* When your application supports having old code and new code running at the same time.

A rolling deployment means you to have both old and new versions of your code
running at the same time. This typically requires that your application handle
xref:n1-compatibility[N-1 compatibility], that data stored by the new version
can be read and handled (or gracefully ignored) by the old version of the code.
This can take many forms -- data stored on disk, in a database, in a temporary
cache, or that is part of a user's browser session. While most web applications
can support rolling deployments, it is important to test and design your
application to handle it.

The following is an example of the Rolling strategy:

====
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: Rolling
  rollingParams:
    timeoutSeconds: 120 <1>
    maxSurge: "20%" <2>
    maxUnavailable: "10%" <3>
    pre: {} <4>
    post: {}
----
<1> How long to wait for a scaling event before giving up. Optional; the default is 120.
<2> `maxSurge` is optional and defaults to `25%` if not specified; see below.
<3> `maxUnavailable` is optional and defaults to `25%` if not specified; see below.
<4> `*pre*` and `*post*` are both xref:lifecycle-hooks[lifecycle hooks].
====

The Rolling strategy will:

. Execute any `pre` lifecycle hook.
. Scale up the new replication controller based on the surge count.
. Scale down the old replication controller based on the max unavailable count.
. Repeat this scaling until the new replication controller has reached the desired
replica count and the old replication controller has been scaled to zero.
. Execute any `post` lifecycle hook.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When scaling down, the Rolling strategy waits for pods to become ready so it can
decide whether further scaling would affect availability. If scaled up pods
never become ready, the deployment process will eventually time out and result in a
deployment failure.
====

The `maxUnavailable` parameter is the maximum number of pods that can be
unavailable during the update. The `maxSurge` parameter is the maximum number
of pods that can be scheduled above the original number of pods. Both parameters
can be set to either a percentage (e.g., `10%`) or an absolute value (e.g.,
`2`). The default value for both is `25%`.

These parameters allow the deployment to be tuned for availability and speed. For
example:

- `*maxUnavailable*=0` and `*maxSurge*=20%` ensures full capacity is maintained
during the update and rapid scale up.
- `*maxUnavailable*=10%` and `*maxSurge*=0` performs an update using no extra
capacity (an in-place update).
- `*maxUnavailable*=10%` and `*maxSurge*=10%` scales up and down quickly with
some potential for capacity loss.

Generally, if you want fast rollouts, use `maxSurge`. If you need to take into
account resource quota and can accept partial unavailability, use
`maxUnavailable`.

[[rolling-example]]
=== Rolling Example

Rolling deployments are the default in {product-title}. To see a rolling update,
follow these steps:

. Create an application based on the example deployment images found in
link:https://hub.docker.com/r/openshift/deployment-example/[DockerHub]:
+
----
$ oc new-app openshift/deployment-example
----
+
If you have the router installed, make the application available via a route (or
use the service IP directly)
+
----
$ oc expose svc/deployment-example
----
+
Browse to the application at `deployment-example.<project>.<router_domain>` to
verify you see the *v1* image.

. Scale the deployment configuration up to three replicas:
+
----
$ oc scale dc/deployment-example --replicas=3
----

. Trigger a new deployment automatically by tagging a new version of the example
as the `latest` tag:
+
----
$ oc tag deployment-example:v2 deployment-example:latest
----

. In your browser, refresh the page until you see the *v2* image.

. If you are using the CLI, the following command will show you how many pods are on version 1 and how many
are on version 2. In the web console, you should see the pods slowly being added to v2 and removed from v1.
+
----
$ oc describe dc deployment-example
----

During the deployment process, the new replication controller is incrementally
scaled up. Once the new pods are marked as *ready* (by passing their readiness
check), the deployment process will continue. If the pods do not become ready,
the process will abort, and the deployment configuration will be rolled back to
its previous version.


[[recreate-strategy]]
=== Recreate Strategy

The Recreate strategy has basic rollout behavior and supports
xref:lifecycle-hooks[lifecycle hooks] for injecting code into the deployment
process.

The following is an example of the Recreate strategy:

====

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: Recreate
  recreateParams: <1>
    pre: {} <2>
    mid: {}
    post: {}
----

<1> `recreateParams` are optional.
<2> `pre`, `mid`, and `post` are xref:lifecycle-hooks[lifecycle hooks].
====

The Recreate strategy will:

. Execute any `pre` lifecycle hook.
. Scale down the previous deployment to zero.
. Execute any `mid` lifecycle hook.
. Scale up the new deployment.
. Execute any `post` lifecycle hook.

[IMPORTANT]
====
During scale up, if the replica count of the deployment is greater than one, the
first replica of the deployment will be validated for readiness before fully
scaling up the deployment. If the validation of the first replica fails, the
deployment will be considered a failure.
====

[[when-to-use-a-recreate-deployment]]
=== When to Use a Recreate Deployment

* When you must run migrations or other data transformations before your new code starts.
* When you do not support having new and old versions of your application code running at the same time.
* When you want to use a RWO volume, which is not supported being shared between multiple replicas.

A recreate deployment incurs downtime because, for a brief period, no instances
of your application are running. However, your old code and new code do not run
at the same time.

[[custom-strategy]]
=== Custom Strategy

The Custom strategy allows you to provide your own deployment behavior.

The following is an example of the Custom strategy:

====

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  type: Custom
  customParams:
    image: organization/strategy
    command: [ "command", "arg1" ]
    environment:
      - name: ENV_1
        value: VALUE_1
----
====

In the above example, the `organization/strategy` container image provides the
deployment behavior. The optional `command` array overrides any `CMD` directive
specified in the image's *_Dockerfile_*. The optional environment variables
provided are added to the execution environment of the strategy process.

Additionally, {product-title} provides the following environment variables to the
deployment process:

[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===
|Environment Variable |Description

.^|`OPENSHIFT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`
|The name of the new deployment (a replication controller).

.^|`OPENSHIFT_DEPLOYMENT_NAMESPACE`
|The name space of the new deployment.
|===

The replica count of the new deployment will initially be zero. The
responsibility of the strategy is to make the new deployment active using the
logic that best serves the needs of the user.

Learn more about xref:advanced-deployment-strategies[advanced deployment
strategies].

[[lifecycle-hooks]]
== Lifecycle Hooks

The xref:recreate-strategy[Recreate] and xref:rolling-strategy[Rolling]
strategies support lifecycle hooks, which allow behavior to be injected into
the deployment process at predefined points within the strategy:

The following is an example of a `pre` lifecycle hook:

====

[source,yaml]
----
pre:
  failurePolicy: Abort
  execNewPod: {} <1>
----

<1> `execNewPod` is xref:pod-based-lifecycle-hook[a pod-based lifecycle hook].
====

Every hook has a `failurePolicy`, which defines the action the strategy should
take when a hook failure is encountered:

[cols="2,8"]
|===

.^|`Abort`
|The deployment process will be considered a failure if the hook fails.

.^|`Retry`
|The hook execution should be retried until it succeeds.

.^|`Ignore`
|Any hook failure should be ignored and the deployment should proceed.
|===

Hooks have a type-specific field that describes how to execute the hook.
Currently, xref:pod-based-lifecycle-hook[pod-based hooks] are the only
supported hook type, specified by the `execNewPod` field.

[[pod-based-lifecycle-hook]]
=== Pod-based Lifecycle Hook

Pod-based lifecycle hooks execute hook code in a new pod derived from the
template in a deployment configuration.

The following simplified example deployment configuration uses the
xref:rolling-strategy[Rolling strategy]. Triggers and some other minor details
are omitted for brevity:

====

[source,yaml]
----
kind: DeploymentConfig
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: helloworld
          image: openshift/origin-ruby-sample
  replicas: 5
  selector:
    name: frontend
  strategy:
    type: Rolling
    rollingParams:
      pre:
        failurePolicy: Abort
        execNewPod:
          containerName: helloworld <1>
          command: [ "/usr/bin/command", "arg1", "arg2" ] <2>
          env: <3>
            - name: CUSTOM_VAR1
              value: custom_value1
          volumes:
            - data <4>
----
<1> The `helloworld` name refers to `spec.template.spec.containers[0].name`.
<2> This `command` overrides any `ENTRYPOINT` defined by the `openshift/origin-ruby-sample` image.
<3> `env` is an optional set of environment variables for the hook container.
<4> `volumes` is an optional set of volume references for the hook container.
====

In this example, the `pre` hook will be executed in a new pod using the
*openshift/origin-ruby-sample* image from the *helloworld* container. The hook
pod will have the following properties:

* The hook command will be `/usr/bin/command arg1 arg2`.
* The hook container will have the `CUSTOM_VAR1=custom_value1` environment variable.
* The hook failure policy is `Abort`, meaning the deployment process will fail if the hook fails.
* The hook pod will inherit the `data` volume from the deployment configuration pod.

[[deployment-hooks-using-the-command-line]]
==== Using the Command Line

The `oc set deployment-hook` command can be used to set the deployment hook for
a deployment configuration. For the example above, you can set the
pre-deployment hook with the following command:

----
$ oc set deployment-hook dc/frontend --pre -c helloworld -e CUSTOM_VAR1=custom_value1 \
  -v data --failure-policy=abort -- /usr/bin/command arg1 arg2
----


[[deployment-resources]]
== Deployment Resources

A deployment is completed by a pod that consumes resources (memory and CPU) on a
node. By default, pods consume unbounded node resources. However, if a project
specifies default container limits, then pods consume resources up to those
limits.

You can also limit resource use by specifying resource limits as part of the
deployment strategy. Deployment resources can be used with the Recreate,
Rolling, or Custom deployment strategies.

In the following example, each of `resources`, `cpu`, and `memory` is
optional:

====
[source,yaml]
----
type: "Recreate"
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: "100m" <1>
    memory: "256Mi" <2>
----

<1> `cpu` is in CPU units: `100m` represents 0.1 CPU units (100 * 1e-3).
<2> `memory` is in bytes: `256Mi` represents 268435456 bytes (256 * 2 ^ 20).
====

However, if a quota has been defined for your project, one of the following two
items is required:

- A `resources` section set with an explicit `requests`:
+
====
[source,yaml]
----
  type: "Recreate"
  resources:
    requests: <1>
      cpu: "100m"
      memory: "256Mi"
----
<1> The `requests` object contains the list of resources that correspond to
the list of resources in the quota.
====

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated,openshift-origin[]
- A xref:../admin_guide/limits.adoc#admin-guide-limits[limit range] defined in your project, where the
defaults from the `LimitRange` object apply to pods created during the
deployment process.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-online[]
- A limit range defined in your project, where the
defaults from the `LimitRange` object apply to pods created during the
deployment process.
endif::[]

Otherwise, deploy pod creation will fail, citing a failure to satisfy quota.

[[scaling]]
== Manual Scaling

In addition to rollbacks, you can exercise fine-grained control over
the number of replicas from the web console, or by using the `oc scale` command.
For example, the following command sets the replicas in the deployment
configuration `frontend` to 3.

----
$ oc scale dc frontend --replicas=3
----

The number of replicas eventually propagates to the desired and current
state of the deployment configured by the deployment configuration `frontend`.

[[assigning-pods-to-specific-nodes]]
== Assigning Pods to Specific Nodes

You can use node selectors in conjunction with labeled nodes to control pod
placement.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
[NOTE]
====
{product-title} administrators can assign labels
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#configuring-node-host-labels[during
an advanced installation], or
xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#updating-labels-on-nodes[added to a node
after installation].
====
endif::[]

Cluster administrators
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
xref:../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#using-node-selectors[can set the
default node selector]
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-online[]
can set the default node selector
endif::[]
for your project in order to restrict pod placement to
specific nodes. As an {product-title} developer, you can set a node selector on a pod
configuration to restrict nodes even further.

To add a node selector when creating a pod, edit the pod configuration, and add
the `nodeSelector` value. This can be added to a single pod configuration, or in
a pod template:

====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    disktype: ssd
...
----
====

Pods created when the node selector is in place are assigned to nodes with the
specified labels.

The labels specified here are used in conjunction with the labels

added by a cluster administrator.

For example, if a project has the `type=user-node` and
`region=east` labels added to a project by the cluster administrator, and you
add the above `disktype: ssd` label to a pod, the pod will only ever be
scheduled on nodes that have all three labels.

[NOTE]
====
Labels can only be set to one value, so setting a node selector of `region=west`
in a pod configuration that has `region=east` as the administrator-set default,
results in a pod that will never be scheduled.

== Running a Pod with a Different Service Account

You can run a pod with a service account other than the default:

. Edit the deployment configuration:
+
----
$ oc edit dc/<deployment_config>
----
. Add the `serviceAccount` and `serviceAccountName` parameters to the `spec`
field, and specify the service account you want to use:
+
----
spec:
  securityContext: {}
  serviceAccount: <service_account>
  serviceAccountName: <service_account>

involve running two versions of an application at the same time and
moving production traffic from the old version to the new version. There are
several ways to implement a blue-green deployment in {product-title}.

[[advanced-deployment-strategies-when-to-use-blue-green-deployment]]
=== When to Use a Blue-Green Deployment

Use a blue-green deployment when you want to test a new version of your
application in a production environment before moving traffic to it.

Blue-green deployments make switching between two different versions of your
application easy. However, since many applications depend on persistent data,
you will need to have an application that supports xref:n1-compatibility[N-1
compatibility] if you share a database, or implement a live data migration
between your database, store, or disk if you choose to create two copies of your
data layer.

[[advanced-deployment-strategies-blue-green-deployments-example]]
=== Blue-Green Deployment Example

In order to maintain control over two distinct groups of instances (old and new
versions of the code), the blue-green deployment is best represented with
multiple deployment configurations.

[[advanced-deployment-strategies-using-a-route-and-two-services]]
=== Using a Route and Two Services

A route points to a service, and can be changed to point to a different service
at any time. As a developer, test the new version of your code by connecting to
the new service before your production traffic is routed to it. Routes are
intended for web (HTTP and HTTPS) traffic, so this technique is best suited
for web applications.

. Create two copies of the example application:
+
----
$ oc new-app openshift/deployment-example:v1 --name=example-green
$ oc new-app openshift/deployment-example:v2 --name=example-blue
----
+
This will create two independent application components: one running the *v1*
image under the `example-green` service, and one using the *v2* image under the
`example-blue` service.

. Create a route that points to the old service:
+
----
$ oc expose svc/example-green --name=bluegreen-example
----

. Browse to the application at `bluegreen-example.<project>.<router_domain>` to
verify you see the *v1* image.
+
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[NOTE]
====
On versions of {product-title} older than v3.0.1, this command will generate a
route at `example-green.<project>.<router_domain>`, not the above location.
====
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[NOTE]
====
On versions of {product-title} older than v1.0.3, this command will generate a
route at `example-green.<project>.<router_domain>`, not the above location.
====
endif::[]

. Edit the route and change the service name to `example-blue`:
+
----
$ oc patch route/bluegreen-example -p '{"spec":{"to":{"name":"example-blue"}}}'
----

. In your browser, refresh the page until you see the *v2* image.

[[advanced-deployment-a-b-deployment]]
=== A/B Deployment

A/B deployments generally imply running two (or more) versions of the
application code or application configuration at the same time for testing or
experimentation purposes.

The simplest form of an A/B deployment is to divide production traffic between
two or more distinct *shards* -- a single group of instances with homogeneous
configuration and code.

More complicated A/B deployments may involve a specialized proxy or load
balancer that assigns traffic to specific shards based on information about the
user or application (all "test" users get sent to the B shard, but regular users
get sent to the A shard).

A/B deployments can be considered similar to A/B testing, although an A/B
deployment implies multiple versions of code and configuration, where as A/B
testing often uses one code base with application specific checks.

[[advanced-deployment-when-to-use-a-b-deployment]]
=== When to Use an A/B Deployment

* When you want to test multiple versions of code or configuration, but are not
planning to roll one out in preference to the other.
* When you want to have different configuration in different regions.

An A/B deployment groups different configuration and code -- multiple shards --
together under a single logical endpoint. Generally, these deployments, if they
access persistent data, should properly deal with N-1 compatibility (the more
shards you have, the more possible versions you have running). Use this pattern
when you need separate internal configuration and code, but end users should not
be aware of the changes.

[[advanced-deployment-a-b-deployment-example]]
=== A/B Deployment Example

All A/B deployments are composite deployment types consisting of multiple
deployment configurations.

[[advanced-deployment-one-service-multiple-deployment-configs]]
=== One Service, Multiple Deployment Configurations

{product-title}, through labels and deployment configurations, supports multiple
simultaneous shards being exposed through the same service. To the consuming
user, the shards are invisible. An example of the simplest possible sharding is
described below:

. Create the first shard of the application based on the example deployment images:
+
----
$ oc new-app openshift/deployment-example --name=ab-example-a --labels=ab-example=true SUBTITLE="shard A"
----

. Edit the newly created shard to set a label `ab-example=true` that will be
common to all shards:
+
----
$ oc edit dc/ab-example-a
----
+
In the editor, add the line `ab-example: "true"` underneath `spec.selector` and
`spec.template.metadata.labels` alongside the existing
`deploymentconfig=ab-example-a` label. Save and exit the editor.

. Trigger a re-deployment of the first shard to pick up the new labels:
+
----
$ oc rollout latest ab-example-a
----

. Create a service that uses the common label:
+
----
$ oc expose dc/ab-example-a --name=ab-example --selector=ab-example=true
----
+
If you have the router installed, make the application available via a route (or
use the service IP directly):
+
----
$ oc expose svc/ab-example
----
+
Browse to the application at `ab-example.<project>.<router_domain>` to verify
you see the *v1* image.

. Create a second shard based on the same source image as the first shard but
different tagged version, and set a unique value:
+
----
$ oc new-app openshift/deployment-example:v2 --name=ab-example-b --labels=ab-example=true SUBTITLE="shard B" COLOR="red"
----

. Edit the newly created shard to set a label `ab-example=true` that will be
common to all shards:
+
----
$ oc edit dc/ab-example-b
----
+
In the editor, add the line `ab-example: "true"` underneath `spec.selector` and
`spec.template.metadata.labels` alongside the existing
`deploymentconfig=ab-example-b` label. Save and exit the editor.

. Trigger a re-deployment of the second shard to pick up the new labels:
+
----
$ oc rollout latest ab-example-b
----

. At this point, both sets of pods are being served under the route. However,
since both browsers (by leaving a connection open) and the router (by default,
through a cookie) will attempt to preserve your connection to a back-end server,
you may not see both shards being returned to you. To force your browser to one
or the other shard, use the scale command:
+
----
$ oc scale dc/ab-example-a --replicas=0
----
+
Refreshing your browser should show *v2* and *shard B* (in red).
+
----
$ oc scale dc/ab-example-a --replicas=1; oc scale dc/ab-example-b --replicas=0
----
+
Refreshing your browser should show *v1* and *shard A* (in blue).
+
If you trigger a deployment on either shard, only the pods in that shard will be
affected. You can easily trigger a deployment by changing the `SUBTITLE`
environment variable in either deployment config `oc edit dc/ab-example-a` or
`oc edit dc/ab-example-b`. You can add additional shards by repeating steps 5-7.
+
[NOTE]
====
These steps will be simplified in future versions of {product-title}.
====

[[proxy-shard-traffic-splitter]]
=== Proxy Shard / Traffic Splitter

In production environments, you can precisely control the distribution
of traffic that lands on a particular shard. When dealing with large numbers of
instances, you can use the relative scale of individual shards to implement
percentage based traffic. That combines well with a *proxy shard*, which
forwards or splits the traffic it receives to a separate service or application
running elsewhere.

In the simplest configuration, the proxy would forward requests unchanged. In
more complex setups, you can duplicate the incoming requests and send to
both a separate cluster as well as to a local instance of the application, and
compare the result. Other patterns include keeping the caches of a DR
installation warm, or sampling incoming traffic for analysis purposes.

While an implementation is beyond the scope of this example, any TCP (or UDP)
proxy could be run under the desired shard. Use the `oc scale` command to alter
the relative number of instances serving requests under the proxy shard. For
more complex traffic management, consider customizing the {product-title} router
with proportional balancing capabilities.

[[n1-compatibility]]
=== N-1 Compatibility

Applications that have new code and old code running at the same time must be
careful to ensure that data written by the new code can be read by the old code.
This is sometimes called _schema evolution_ and is a complex problem.

For some applications, the period of time that old code and new code is running
side by side is short, so bugs or some failed user transactions are
acceptable. For others, the failure pattern may result in the entire application
becoming non-functional.

One way to validate N-1 compatibility is to use an A/B deployment. Run the old
code and new code at the same time in a controlled way in a test environment,
and verify that traffic that flows to the new deployment does not cause failures
in the old deployment.

[[graceful-termination]]
=== Graceful Termination

{product-title} and Kubernetes give application instances time to shut down
before removing them from load balancing rotations. However, applications must
ensure they cleanly terminate user connections as well before they exit.

On shutdown, {product-title} will send a *TERM* signal to the processes in the
container. Application code, on receiving *SIGTERM*, should stop accepting new
connections. This will ensure that load balancers route traffic to other active
instances. The application code should then wait until all open connections are
closed (or gracefully terminate individual connections at the next opportunity)
before exiting.

After the graceful termination period expires, a process that has not exited
will be sent the *KILL* signal, which immediately ends the process. The
`terminationGracePeriodSeconds` attribute of a pod or pod template controls
the graceful termination period (default 30 seconds) and may be customized per
application as necessary.
