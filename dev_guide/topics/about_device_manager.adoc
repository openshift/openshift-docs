== What Device Manager Does

[IMPORTANT]
====
Device Manager is a Technology Preview feature.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to
upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide
feedback during the development process.

Device Manager is a Kubelet feature that provides a mechanism for advertising
specialized node hardware resources with the help of Kubelet plug-ins known as
xref:../dev_guide/device_plugins.adoc#using-device-plugins[device plug-ins].

Any vendor can implement a device plug-in to advertise their specialized
hardware without requiring any upstream code changes.

Device Manager advertises devices as *Extended Resources*. User pods can consume
devices, advertised by Device Manager, using the same *Limit/Request* mechanism,
which is used for requesting any other *Extended Resource*.

[[registration]]
=== Registration

Upon start, the
xref:../dev_guide/device_plugins.adoc#using-device-plugins[device plug-in]
registers itself with Device Manager invoking `Register` on the
*_/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins/kubelet.sock_* and starts a gRPC service at
*_/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins/<plugin>.sock_* for serving Device Manager
requests.

[[device-discovery-monitoring]]
=== Device Discovery and Health Monitoring

Device Manager, while processing a new registration request, invokes
`ListAndWatch` remote procedure call (RPC) at the device plug-in service. In
response, Device Manger gets a list of *Device* objects from the plug-in over a
gRPC stream. Device Manager will keep watching on the stream for new updates
from the plug-in. On the plug-in side, the plug-in will also keep the stream
open and whenever there is a change in the state of any of the devices, a new
device list is sent to the Device Manager over the same streaming connection.

[[device-allocation]]
=== Device Allocation

While handling a new pod admission request, Kubelet passes requested `Extended
Resources` to the Device Manager for device allocation. Device Manager checks in
its database to verify if a corresponding plug-in exists or not. If the plug-in exists
and there are free allocatable devices as well as per local cache, `Allocate`
RPC is invoked at that particular device plug-in.

Additionally, device plug-ins can also perform several other device-specific
operations, such as driver installation, device initialization, and device
resets. These functionalities vary from implementation to implementation.
