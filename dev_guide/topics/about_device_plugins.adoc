== What Device Plug-ins Do

Device plug-ins allow you to use a particular device type (GPU, InfiniBand,
or other similar computing resources that require vendor-specific initialization
and setup) in your {product-title} pod without needing to write custom code. The
device plug-in provides a consistent and portable solution to consume hardware
devices across clusters. The device plug-in provides support for these devices
through an extension mechanism, which makes these devices available to
containers, provides health checks of these devices, and securely shares them.

A device plug-in is a gRPC service running on the nodes (external to
`atomic-openshift-node.service`) that is responsible for managing specific
hardware resources. Any device plug-in must support following remote procedure
calls (RPCs):

----
service DevicePlugin {
      // ListAndWatch returns a stream of List of Devices
      // Whenever a Device state change or a Device disappears, ListAndWatch
      // returns the new list
      rpc ListAndWatch(Empty) returns (stream ListAndWatchResponse) {}

      // Allocate is called during container creation so that the Device
      // Plugin can run device specific operations and instruct Kubelet
      // of the steps to make the Device available in the container
      rpc Allocate(AllocateRequest) returns (AllocateResponse) {}
}
