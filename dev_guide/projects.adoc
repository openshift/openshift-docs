== Overview

A xref:../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-projects-and-users[project] allows a
community of users to organize and manage their content in isolation from other
communities.

[[create-a-project]]

== Creating a Project

xref:../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#selfprovisioning-projects[If allowed] by your cluster administrator,
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-aro,openshift-online[]
If allowed,
endif::[]
you can create a new project using xref:../cli_reference/index.adoc#cli-reference-index[the CLI] or the xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-web-console[web console].

[[create-a-project-using-the-web-console]]
=== Using the Web Console
To create a new project using the web console, click the *Create Project* button
on the Projects panel or the Projects page.

image::3.7-create-project.png[Create Project]

The *Create Project* button is displayed by default, but can be optionally
hidden or customized.

[[create-a-project-using-the-cli]]
=== Using the CLI
To create a new project using the CLI:

----
$ oc new-project <project_name> \
    --description="<description>" --display-name="<display_name>"
----

For example:

----
$ oc new-project hello-openshift \
    --description="This is an example project to demonstrate OpenShift v3" \
    --display-name="Hello OpenShift"
----

[NOTE]
====
The number of projects you are allowed to create
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
xref:../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#limit-projects-per-user[may be limited by the system administrator].
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
may be limited by the system administrator.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-online[]
is limited.
endif::[]
Once your limit is reached, you may need to delete an existing project in order to create a new one.
====

[[view-projects]]

== Viewing Projects

When viewing projects, you are restricted to seeing only the projects you have
access to view based on the
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authorization[authorization
policy].

To view a list of projects:

----
$ oc get projects
----

You can change from the current project to a different project for CLI
operations. The specified project is then used in all subsequent operations that
manipulate project-scoped content:

----
$ oc project <project_name>
----

You can also use the
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-web-console[web console] to
view and change between projects. After xref:authentication.adoc#dev-guide-authentication[authenticating]
and logging in, you are presented with a list of projects that you have access
to.

The right panel shown with the service catalog provides quick access to the most
recently accessed projects (up to five projects). For the full list of projects,
use the *View All* link provided at the top of the right panel.

image::3.9-project-list.jpg[Projects List]

If you use xref:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.adoc#cli-reference-get-started-cli[the CLI] to
xref:create-a-project[create a new project], you can then refresh the page in
the browser to see the new project.

Selecting a project brings you to the
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#project-overviews[project
overview] for that project.

Clicking on the kebab menu for a particular project presents you with the
following options:

image::3-7-project-kebab-options.png[Project Kebab Menu]

[[check-project-status]]
== Checking Project Status

The `oc status` command provides a high-level overview of the current project,
with its components and their relationships. This command takes no argument:

----
$ oc status
----

[[filtering-by-labels]]

== Filtering by Labels
You can filter the contents of a project page in the
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-web-console[web console] by
using the
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[labels] of a
resource. You can pick from a suggested label name and values, or type in your
own. Multiple filters can be added. When multiple filters are applied, resources
must match all of the filters to remain visible.

To filter by labels:

. Select a label type:
+
image::3.7-overview-list-by-options.png[List of options]

. Select one of the following:
+
[horizontal]
exists:: Verify that the label name exists, but ignore its value.
does not exist:: Verify that the label name does not exist, but ignore its value.
in:: Verify that the label name exists and is equal to one of the selected
values.
not in:: Verify that the label name does not exist, or is not equal to any of
the selected values.
+
image::3.7-overview-filter-by-matching.png["Web Console Filter Step 2"]
+
.. If you selected *in* or *not in*, select a set of values then select
*Filter*:
+
image::3.7-overview-filter-by-label-value.png["Web Console Filter Step 3"]

. After adding filters, you can stop filtering by selecting *Clear all filters*
or by clicking individual filters to remove them:
+
image::3.7-clear-filter.png[Clear filters]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]

[[web-console-bookmarking-page-states]]
== Bookmarking Page States

The {product-title}
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-web-console[web
console] now bookmarks page states, which is helpful in saving label filters and
other settings.

When you do something to change the page's state, like switching between tabs,
the URL in the browser's navigation bar is automatically updated.

endif::openshift-enterprise[]


[[delete-a-project]]

== Deleting a Project

When you delete a project, the server updates the project status to Terminating
from Active. The server then clears all content from a project that is
Terminating before finally removing the project. While a project is in
Terminating status, a user cannot add new content to the project. Projects can
be deleted from the CLI or the web console.

To delete a project using the CLI:

----
$ oc delete project <project_name>
----

ifdef::openshift-online[]
[[project-collaboration-in-online-pro]]
== Project Collaboration in {product-title} Pro

[IMPORTANT]
====
Collaboration is not available in {product-title} Starter.
====

Every {product-title} Pro account has the ability to add up to 50 collaborator
users per subscription. These collaborator users are granted cluster access from
{product-title} Pro account subscribers so that they can collaborate on projects
hosted with {product-title}. This allows multiple users to gain access to
projects under a single subscription, without having to pay a monthly fee for
every account.

[[collaboration-restrictions]]
=== Collaboration Restrictions

Collaborators can only access the resources within the projects that they have
been granted access. Also, their ability to view, edit, and manage the
project resources will depend on the specific role that they have been granted
within the project.

[[project-collaboration-adding-collaborators]]
=== Adding Collaborators
{product-title} Pro subscribers can add collaborators by following these steps:

. Each user you want to add as a collaborator must create a free account at
 link:https://developers.redhat.com/[developers.redhat.com]. Once your
 collaborator has confirmed their Red Hat Developers account, you can add them
 to your subscription.

 . Each collaborator must sign in to
link:https://developers.redhat.com/[developers.redhat.com] and click on their
name in the upper-right corner to access their account details. Make note of the
*Red Hat Login ID* on this page, as it is the user name you will be required to
enter in order to associate the collaborator with your subscription.

. Sign in to link:https://manage.openshift.com[manage.openshift.com] and click on
*Manage Subscription* under the cluster where you want to add the collaborator.
+
image::manage-subscriptions-collaboration.png[]

. Once you are in the subscription management console, click the *Manage* link
under the *Collaborators* heading, which brings you to the *Collaboration* page.
+
image::manage-collaborators.png[]

. On the *Collaboration* page, enter the *Red Hat Login ID* for the user in the user
name field and click *Add Collaborator*.
+
You should now see the user listed under your collaborators, the time the user
was added, and an option to remove the user from your subscription.
+
This does not automatically grant the user any access to your projects. Access
must be granted manually by the project owner using
xref:granting-project-access-using-the-cli[`oc policy` commands] or the
xref:granting-project-access-using-the-web-console[web console].

[[granting-project-access-using-the-web-console]]
=== Granting Project Access Using the Web Console

After xref:project-collaboration-adding-collaborators[adding the collaborator]
to your {product-title} Pro subscription, you can grant project access to the
collaborator using the web console.

. From within a project, click *Resources*, then *Membership*.

. Add roles (for example, *view*, *edit*, or *admin*) to the user you want to
grant access.
+
See
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authorization[Authorization]
for more information on access roles.
+
Now, when the collaborator user signs in to
link:https://manage.openshift.com[manage.openshift.com], they will see a card to
log in to the web console for the same cluster as your subscription and, if the
collaborator was granted access to your projects on the cluster, they will have
access just like any other user.

[[granting-project-access-using-the-cli]]
=== Granting Project Access Using the CLI

After xref:project-collaboration-adding-collaborators[adding the collaborator]
to your {product-title} Pro subscription, you can grant project access to the
collaborator using the CLI.

. Log in to the cluster through the CLI using your access token.

. Grant the user a role using the same user name listed on the *Collaboration* page using:
+
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user <role-name> <username>
----
+
For example:
+
----
~$ oc login https://api.openshift.com --token=<...>
Logged into "https://api.openshift.com:443" as "exampleuser" using the token provided.

You have one project on this server: "exampleuser-collab"

Using project "exampleuser-collab".
~$ oc policy add-role-to-user view collaborator-1234
role "view" added: "collaborator-1234"
----
+
This example grants *view* access to the project for user `collaborator-1234`.
See
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authorization[Authorization]
for more information on access roles.
+
Now, when the collaborator user signs in to
link:https://manage.openshift.com[manage.openshift.com], they will see a card to
log in to the web console for the same cluster as your subscription and, if the
collaborator was granted access to your projects on the cluster, they will have
access just like any other user.

[[project-collaboration-removing-collaborators]]
=== Removing Collaborators

If at any time you wish to remove the user as a collaborator from your
subscription, you can do so on the same *Collaboration* page you used to add
them. It is important to note, however, that this will not automatically remove
any roles you have assigned the user in your projects. These will need to be
manually deleted, or the user may still have access to your projects.

[[removing-project-access-using-the-web-console]]
==== Removing Project Access Using the Web Console

You can remove project access from the collaborator using the web console.

. From within a project, click *Resources*, then *Membership*.

. Remove roles (for example, *view*, *edit*, or *admin*) from the user.

[[removing-project-access-using-the-cli]]
==== Removing Project Access Using the CLI

You can remove project access from the collaborator using the CLI.

. Log in to the cluster through the CLI using your access token.

. Remove a role (for example, *view*, *edit*, or *admin*) from a specific
collaborator using the same user name listed on the *Collaboration* page by
running:
+
----
$ oc policy remove-role-from-user <role-name> <username>
----
endif::openshift-online[]
