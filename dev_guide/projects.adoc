== Overview

A link:../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.html[project] allows a
community of users to organize and manage their content in isolation from other
communities.

[[create-a-project]]

== Creating a Project

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
link:../admin_guide/managing_projects.html#selfprovisioning-projects[If allowed]
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
If allowed
endif::[]
by your cluster
administrator, you can create a new project using link:../cli_reference/index.html[the CLI] or the link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.html[web console].

To create a new project using the CLI:

----
$ oc new-project <project_name> \
    --description="<description>" --display-name="<display_name>"
----

For example:

====

----
$ oc new-project hello-openshift \
    --description="This is an example project to demonstrate OpenShift v3" \
    --display-name="Hello OpenShift"
----
====

[[view-projects]]

== Viewing Projects

When viewing projects, you are restricted to seeing only the projects you have
access to view based on the
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html[authorization
policy].

To view a list of projects:

----
$ oc get projects
----

You can change from the current project to a different project for CLI
operations. The specified project is then used in all subsequent operations that
manipulate project-scoped content:

----
$ oc project <project_name>
----

You can also use the
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.html[web console] to
view and change between projects. After link:authentication.html[authenticating]
and logging in, you are presented with a list of projects that you have access
to:

====

====

If you use link:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.html[the CLI] to
link:#create-a-project[create a new project], you can then refresh the page in
the browser to see the new project.

Selecting a project brings you to the
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.html#project-overviews[project
overview] for that project.

[[check-project-status]]

== Checking Project Status

The `oc status` command provides a high-level overview of the current project,
with its components and their relationships. This command takes no argument:

----
$ oc status
----

[[filtering-by-labels]]

== Filtering by Labels
You can filter the contents of a project page in the
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.html[web console] by
using the
link:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#labels[labels] of a
resource. You can pick from a suggested label name and values, or type in your
own. Multiple filters can be added. When multiple filters are applied, resources
must match all of the filters to remain visible.

To filter by labels:

. Select a label type:
+
====

image::console_filter_step1.png["Web Console Filter Step 1"]
====

. Select one of the following:
+
[horizontal]
exists:: Verify that the label name exists, but ignore its value.
in:: Verify that the label name exists and is equal to one of the selected
values.
not in:: Verify that the label name does not exist, or is not equal to any of
the selected values.
+
====

. After adding filters, you can stop filtering by selecting *Clear all filters*
or by clicking individual filters to remove them:

[[delete-a-project]]

== Deleting a Project

When you delete a project, the server updates the project status to Terminating
from Active. The server then clears all content from a project that is
Terminating before finally removing the project. While a project is in
Terminating status, a user cannot add new content to the project.

To delete a project:

----
$ oc delete project <project_name>
----
