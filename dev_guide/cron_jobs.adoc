== Overview

A _cron job_ builds on a regular
xref:../dev_guide/jobs.adoc#dev-guide-jobs[job] by allowing you to specifically
schedule how the job should be run. Cron jobs are part of the
link:http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/cron-jobs[Kubernetes] API, which
can be managed with `oc` commands like other
xref:../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#object-types[object types].

[WARNING]
====
A cron job creates a job object approximately once per execution time of its
schedule, but there are circumstances in which it will fail to create a job or
two jobs might be created. As a result, jobs should be idempotent.

== Creating a Cron Job

A cron job configuration consists of the following key parts:

* A schedule specified in link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron[cron format].
* A job template used when creating the next job.
* An optional deadline (in seconds) for starting the job if it misses its
scheduled time for any reason. Missed jobs executions will be counted as failed
ones. If not specified, there is no deadline.
* `*ConcurrencyPolicy*`: An optional concurrency policy, specifying how to treat
concurrent jobs within a cron job. Only one of the following concurrent
policies may be specified. If not specified, this defaults to allowing
concurrent executions.
** `Allow` allows Cron Jobs to run concurrently.
** `Forbid` forbids concurrent runs, skipping the next run if the previous has not
finished yet.
** `Replace` cancels the currently running job and replaces
it with a new one.
* An optional flag allowing the suspension of a cron job. If set to `true`,
all subsequent executions will be suspended.

The following is an example of a `*CronJob*` resource:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: batch/v2alpha1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: pi
spec:
  schedule: "*/1 * * * *"  <1>
  jobTemplate:             <2>
    spec:
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:          <3>
            parent: "cronjobpi"
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: pi
            image: perl
            command: ["perl",  "-Mbignum=bpi", "-wle", "print bpi(2000)"]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure <4>
----

1. Schedule for the job. In this example, the job will run every minute.
2. Job template. This is similar to the xref:../dev_guide/jobs.adoc#creating-a-job[job example].
3. Sets a label for jobs spawned by this cron job.
4. The restart policy of the pod. This does not apply to the job controller. See xref:../dev_guide/jobs.adoc#creating-a-job-known-issues[Known Issues and Limitations] for details.

You can also create and launch a cron job from a single command using `oc run`. The following command creates and launches the same cron job as specified in the previous example:

----
$ oc run pi --image=perl --schedule='*/1 * * * *' \
    --restart=OnFailure --labels parent="cronjobpi" \
    --command -- perl -Mbignum=bpi -wle 'print bpi(2000)'
----

With `oc run`, the `--schedule` option accepts schedules in link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron[cron format].

[NOTE]
=====
When creating a cron job,  `oc run` only supports the `Never` or `OnFailure` restart policies (`--restart`).
=====

[TIP]
=====
Delete cron jobs that you no longer need:
----
$ oc delete cronjob/<cron_job_name>
----
Doing this prevents them from generating unnecessary artifacts.

== Cleaning Up After a Cron Job

Cron jobs can leave behind artifact resources such as jobs or pods. Check if any remain:

----
$ oc get jobs
$ oc get pods
----

All artifacts left over from a job execution use the job name as their prefix. For example, given the cron job example:

----
$ oc get jobs
NAME            DESIRED   SUCCESSFUL   AGE
pi-1497848100   1         1            1m
pi-1497848160   1         1            49s

$ oc get pods
NAME                  READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
pi-1497848100-lxs4k   0/1       Completed   0          2m
pi-1497848160-6r0c8   0/1       Completed   0          59s
----

Delete each artifact if you no longer need them. To delete all jobs spawned by a cron job, specify the label set during cron job creation:

----
$ oc delete jobs -l <label>
----

For example, to delete only the jobs generated by the cron job example:

----
$ oc delete jobs -l parent=cronjobpi
job "pi-1497848100" deleted
job "pi-1497848160" deleted
----
