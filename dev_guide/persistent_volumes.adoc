== Overview

A `PersistentVolume` object is a storage resource in an {product-title} cluster.
Storage is provisioned by your cluster administrator by creating
`PersistentVolume` objects from sources such as GCE Persistent Disk, AWS
Elastic Block Store (EBS), and NFS mounts.

Storage can be made available to you by laying claims to the resource. You can
make a request for storage resources using a `PersistentVolumeClaim` object;
the claim is paired with a volume that generally matches your request.

[[persistent-volumes-requesting-storage]]
== Requesting Storage

You can request storage by creating `PersistentVolumeClaim` objects in your
projects:

.Persistent Volume Claim Object Definition
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "PersistentVolumeClaim"
metadata:
  name: "claim1"
spec:
  accessModes:
    - "ReadWriteOnce"
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: "1Gi"
  volumeName: "pv0001"

topic for information about restrictions when using persistent volumes with
{product-title}.

[[persistent-volumes-volume-and-claim-building]]
== Volume and Claim Binding

A `PersistentVolume` is a specific resource. A `PersistentVolumeClaim` is a
request for a resource with specific attributes, such as storage size. In
between the two is a process that matches a claim to an available volume and
binds them together. This allows the claim to be used as a volume in a pod.
{product-title} finds the volume backing the claim and mounts it into the pod.

You can tell whether a claim or volume is bound by querying using the CLI:

----
$ oc get pvc
NAME        LABELS    STATUS    VOLUME
claim1      map[]     Bound     pv0001

$ oc get pv
NAME                LABELS              CAPACITY            ACCESSMODES         STATUS    CLAIM
pv0001              map[]               5368709120          RWO                 Bound     yournamespace / claim1
----

[[persistent-volumes-claims-as-volumes-in-pods]]
== Claims as Volumes in Pods

A `PersistentVolumeClaim` is used by a pod as a volume. {product-title} finds the
claim with the given name in the same namespace as the pod, then uses the claim
to find the corresponding volume to mount.

.Pod Definition with a Claim
[source,yaml]

    name: "frontendhttp"

    -
      name: "myfrontend"
      image: "nginx"

      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: "claim1"

[[persistent-volumes-volumes-and-claim-prebinding]]
== Volume and Claim Pre-binding

If you know exactly what `PersistentVolume` you want your
`PersistentVolumeClaim` to bind to, you can specify the PV in your PVC using the
`volumeName` field. This method skips the normal matching and binding process.
The PVC will only be able to bind to a PV that has the same name specified in
`volumeName`. If such a PV with that name exists and is `Available`, the PV and
PVC will be bound regardless of whether the PV satisfies the PVC's label
selector, access modes, and resource requests.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The ability to set `claimRefs` is a temporary workaround for the described use
cases. A long-term solution for limiting who can claim a volume is in
development.
====

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
[NOTE]
====
The cluster administrator should first consider configuring
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/selector_label_binding.adoc#selector-label-volume-binding[selector-label
volume binding] before resorting to setting `claimRefs` on behalf of users.
====

You may also want your cluster administrator to "reserve" the volume for only
your claim so that nobody else's claim can bind to it before yours does. In
this case, the administrator can specify the PVC in the PV using the `claimRef`
field. The PV will only be able to bind to a PVC that has the same name and
namespace specified in `claimRef`. The PVC's access modes and resource requests
must still be satisfied in order for the PV and PVC to be bound, though the
label selector is ignored.

.Persistent Volume Object Definition with claimRef
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv0001
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  nfs:
    path: /tmp
    server: 172.17.0.2
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Recycle
  claimRef:
    name: claim1
    namespace: default
----

Specifying a `volumeName` in your PVC does not prevent a different
PVC from binding to the specified PV before yours does. Your claim will remain
`Pending` until the PV is `Available`.

Specifying a `claimRef` in a PV does not prevent the specified PVC from being
bound to a different PV. The PVC is free to choose another PV to bind to
according to the normal binding process. Therefore, to avoid these scenarios and
ensure your claim gets bound to the volume you want, you must ensure that both
`volumeName` and `claimRef` are specified.

You can tell that your setting of `volumeName` and/or `claimRef` influenced the
matching and binding process by inspecting a `Bound` PV and PVC pair for the
`pv.kubernetes.io/bound-by-controller` annotation. The PVs and PVCs where you
set the `volumeName` and/or `claimRef` yourself will have no such annotation,
but ordinary PVs and PVCs will have it set to `"yes"`.

When a PV has its `claimRef` set to some PVC name and namespace, and is
reclaimed according to a `Retain` or `Recycle` reclaim policy, its `claimRef`
will remain set to the same PVC name and namespace even if the PVC or the whole
namespace no longer exists.
