== Overview
A `*PersistentVolume*` object is a storage resource in an OpenShift cluster.
Storage is provisioned by your cluster administrator by creating
`*PersistentVolume*` objects from sources such as GCE Persistent Disk, AWS
Elastic Block Store (EBS), and NFS mounts.

Storage can be made available to you by laying claims to the resource. You can
make a request for storage resources using a `*PersistentVolumeClaim*` object;
the claim is paired with a volume that generally matches your request.

== Requesting Storage
You can request storage by creating `*PersistentVolumeClaim*` objects in your
projects:

.Persistent Volume Claim Object Definition
====

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "PersistentVolumeClaim"
metadata:
  name: "claim1"
spec:
  accessModes:
    - "ReadWriteOnce"
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: "5Gi"
----

== Volume and Claim Binding
A `*PersistentVolume*` is a specific resource. A `*PersistentVolumeClaim*` is a
request for a resource with specific attributes, such as storage size. In
between the two is a process that matches a claim to an available volume and
binds them together. This allows the claim to be used as a volume in a pod.
OpenShift finds the volume backing the claim and mounts it into the pod.

You can tell whether a claim or volume is bound by querying using the CLI:

====
----
$ oc get pvc
NAME        LABELS    STATUS    VOLUME
claim1      map[]     Bound     pv0001

$ oc get pv
NAME                LABELS              CAPACITY            ACCESSMODES         STATUS    CLAIM
pv0001              map[]               5368709120          RWO                 Bound     yournamespace / claim1
----

== Claims as Volumes in Pods

A `*PersistentVolumeClaim*` is used by a pod as a volume. OpenShift finds the
claim with the given name in the same namespace as the pod, then uses the claim
to find the corresponding volume to mount.

.Pod Definition with a Claim
====

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "Pod"
metadata:
  name: "mypod"
  labels:
    name: "frontendhttp"
spec:
  containers:
    -
      name: "myfrontend"
      image: "nginx"
      ports:
        -
          containerPort: 80
          name: "http-server"
      volumeMounts:
        -
          mountPath: "/var/www/html"
          name: "pvol"
  volumes:
    -
      name: "pvol"
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: "claim1"
