== Overview

Container image signing on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) systems provides a
means of:

- Validating where a container image came from,
- Checking that the image has not been tampered with, and
- Setting policies to determine which validated images can be pulled to a host.

For a more complete understanding of the architecture of container image signing
on RHEL systems, see the
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2750891#architecture[Container Image Signing Integration Guide].

The OpenShift Container Registry allows the ability to store signatures via REST
API. The `oc` CLI can be used to verify image signatures, with their validiated
displayed in the web console or CLI.

[[signing-images-using-atomic-cli]]
== Signing Images Using Atomic CLI

{product-title} does not automate image signing. Signing requires a developer's
private GPG key, typically stored securely on a workstation. This document
describes that workflow.

The `atomic` command line interface (CLI), version 1.12.5 or greater, provides
commands for signing container images, which can be pushed to an OpenShift
Container Registry. The `atomic` CLI is available on Red Hat-based
distributions: RHEL, Centos, and Fedora.

You can sign an image at push time:

----
$ atomic push [--sign-by ...] <image>
----

Or you can sign an image that has already been pushed to the registry:

----
$ atomic sign [--sign-by ...] <image>
----

For full details on how to set up and perform image signing using the `atomic`
CLI, see the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html/managing_containers/signing_container_images[RHEL Atomic Host Managing Containers: Signing Container Images] documentation.

A specific example workflow of working with the `atomic` CLI and an OpenShift
Container Registry is documented in the
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2750891#working-with-openshift-and-atomic-registry[Container Image Signing Integration Guide].

[[accessing-image-signatures-using-registry-api]]
== Accessing Image Signatures Using Registry API

The OpenShift Container Registry provides an `extensions` endpoint that allows
you to write and read image signatures. The image signatures are stored in the
{product-title} key-value store via the Docker Registry API.

[NOTE]
====
This endpoint is experimental and not supported by the upstream Docker Registry
project. See the link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/[upstream API
documentation] for general information about the Docker Registry API.
====

[[writing-image-signatures-using-registry-api]]
=== Writing Image Signatures

In order to add a new signature to the image, you can use the HTTP `PUT` method
to send a JSON payload to the `extensions` endpoint:

----
PUT /extensions/v2/<namespace>/<name>/signatures/<digest>
----

----
$ curl -X PUT --data @signature.json http://<user>:<token>@<registry_endpoint>:5000/extensions/v2/<namespace>/<name>/signatures/sha256:<digest>
----

The JSON payload with the signature content should have the following structure:

----
{
  "version": 2,
  "type":    "atomic",
  "name":    "sha256:4028782c08eae4a8c9a28bf661c0a8d1c2fc8e19dbaae2b018b21011197e1484@cddeb7006d914716e2728000746a0b23",
  "content": "<cryptographic_signature>"
}
----

The `name` field contains the name of the image signature, which must be unique
and in the format `<digest>@<name>`. The `<digest>` represents an image name and
the `<name>` is the name of the signature. The signature name must be 32
characters long. The `<cryptographic_signature>` must follow the specification
documented in the
link:https://github.com/containers/image/blob/master/docs/atomic-signature.md#the-cryptographic-signature[containers/image] library.

[NOTE]
====
In order to attach the signature to the image, the user must have the
`system:image-signer` cluster role.
ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
Cluster administrators can add this using:

----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user system:image-signer <user_name>
----
endif::[]
====

[[reading-image-signatures-via-registry-api]]
=== Reading Image Signatures

Assuming a signed image has already been pushed into the OpenShift Container
Registry, you can read the signatures using the following command:

----
GET /extensions/v2/<namespace>/<name>/signatures/<digest>
----

----
$ curl http://<user>:<token>@<registry_endpoint>:5000/extensions/v2/<namespace>/<name>/signatures/sha256:<digest>
----

The `<namespace>` represents the {product-title} project name or registry
repository name and the `<name>` refers to the name of the image repository. The
`digest` represents the SHA-256 checksum of the image.

If the given image contains the signature data, the output of the command above
should produce following JSON response:

----
{
  "signatures": [
  {
    "version": 2,
    "type":    "atomic",
    "name":    "sha256:4028782c08eae4a8c9a28bf661c0a8d1c2fc8e19dbaae2b018b21011197e1484@cddeb7006d914716e2728000746a0b23",
    "content": "<cryptographic_signature>"
  }
  ]
}
----

The `name` field contains the name of the image signature, which must be unique
and in the format `<digest>@<name>`. The `<digest>` represents an image name and
the `<name>` is the name of the signature. The signature name must be 32
characters long. The `<cryptographic_signature>` must follow the specification
documented in the
link:https://github.com/containers/image/blob/master/docs/atomic-signature.md#the-cryptographic-signature[containers/image] library.

[[verifying-image-signatures-using-openshift-cli]]
== Verifying Image Signatures Using OpenShift CLI

You can verify the signatures of an image imported to an OpenShift Container
Registry using the `oc adm verify-image-signature` command. This command
verifies if the image identity contained in the image signature can be trusted
by using the public GPG key to verify the signature itself then match the
provided expected identity with the identity (the pull spec) of the given image.

By default, this command uses the public GPG keyring located in
*_$GNUPGHOME/pubring.gpg_*, typically in path *_~/.gnupg_*. By default, this
command does not save the result of the verification back to the image object.
To do so, you must specify the `--save` flag.

[NOTE]
====
To modify the image signature verification status, your account must have to
have permissions to edit image objects, for example using the `image-auditor`
role.
====

Using the `--save` flag on already verified image together with invalid GPG key
or invalid expected identity causes the saved verification status to be removed,
and the image will become unverified.

To verify an image signature:

----
$ oc adm verify-image-signature <image> --expected-identity=<pull_spec> [--save] [options]
----
