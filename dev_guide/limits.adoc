== Overview

A `*LimitRange*` object enumerates compute resource constraints in a link:projects.html[project].

== Constraints

A `*LimitRange*` object enumerates compute resource constraints at a Pod and Container scope in a project.

All resource create and modification requests are evaluated against each `*LimitRange*` object in the project.  If the resource violates any of the enumerated constraints, then the resource is rejected.  If the resource does not set an explicit value, and if the constraint supports a default value, then the default value is
applied to the resource.

=== Container limits

Supported Resources:

1. cpu
2. memory

Supported Constraints:

Per container, the following must hold true if specified:

.Container
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Constraint |Behavior

|`*Min*`
|Min[resource] <= container.resources.requests[resource] (required) <= container/resources.limits[resource] (optional)

|`*Max*`
|container.resources.limits[resource] (required) <= Max[resource]

|`*MaxLimitRequestRatio*`
|MaxLimitRequestRatio[resource] <= ( container.resources.limits[resource] / container.resources.requests[resource])

|===

Supported defaults:

1. Default[resource] - defaults container.resources.limit[resource] to specified value if none
2. Default Requests[resource] - defaults container.resources.requests[resource] to specified value if none

=== Pod limits

Supported Resources:

1. cpu
2. memory

Supported Constraints:

Across all containers in a pod, the following must hold true:

.Pod
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Constraint |Behavior

|`*Min*`
|Min[resource] <= container.resources.requests[resource] (required) <= container/resources.limits[resource] (optional)

|`*Max*`
|container.resources.limits[resource] (required) <= Max[resource]

|`*MaxLimitRequestRatio*`
|MaxLimitRequestRatio[resource] <= ( container.resources.limits[resource] / container.resources.requests[resource])

== Creating a Limit Range

To apply a limit range to a project, create a link:#limit-range-def[limit range
object definition] on your file system to your specifications, then run:

----
$ oc create -f <limit_range_file>
----

== Viewing Limits

To view limits enforced in a project:

====
----
$ oc get limits
NAME
limits

$ oc describe limits limits
Name:        limits
Namespace:   default
Type         Resource  Min Max Request Limit Limit/Request
----         --------  --- --- ------- ----- -------------
Pod          memory    6Mi 1Gi -       -     -
Pod          cpu       200m  2 -       -     -
Container    cpu       100m  2 200m    300m  10
Container    memory    4Mi 1Gi 100Mi   200Mi -

== Deleting Limits

If you do not want to enforce limits in a project, you can remove any active
limit range by name:

----
$ oc delete limits <limit_name>
----
