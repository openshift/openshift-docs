== Overview

A `*LimitRange*` object enumerates link:compute_resources.html[compute resource
constraints] in a link:projects.html[project] at the pod and container level.
This allows you to specify the amount of resources that a pod or container can
consume.

[[setting-limit-range-constraints]]
== Setting Limit Range Constraints

All resource create and modification requests are evaluated against each
`*LimitRange*` object in the project. If the resource violates any of the
enumerated constraints, then the resource is rejected. If the resource does not
set an explicit value, and if the constraint supports a default value, then the
default value is applied to the resource.

[[container-limits]]
=== Container Limits

*Supported Resources:*

* CPU
* Memory

*Supported Constraints:*

Per container, the following must hold true if specified:

.Container
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Constraint |Behavior

|`*Min*`
|Min[resource] <= container.resources.requests[resource] (required) <= container/resources.limits[resource] (optional)

If the configuration defines a `min` CPU, then the request value must be greater
than the CPU value. A limit value does not need to be specified.

|`*Max*`
|container.resources.limits[resource] (required) <= Max[resource]

If the configuration defines a `max` CPU, then you do not need to define a
request value, but a limit value does need to be set that satisfies the maximum
CPU constraint.

|`*MaxLimitRequestRatio*`
|MaxLimitRequestRatio[resource] <= ( container.resources.limits[resource] / container.resources.requests[resource])

If a configuration defines a `maxLimitRequestRatio` value, then any new
containers must have both a request and limit value. Additionally, OpenShift
calculates a limit to request ratio by dividing the limit by the request. For
example, if a container has `cpu: 500` in the `limit` value, and `cpu: 100` in
the `request` value, then its limit to request ratio for `cpu` is `5`. This
ratio must be less than or equal to the `maxLimitRequestRatio`.

|===

*Supported Defaults:*

* Default[resource] - defaults container.resources.limit[resource] to specified value if none
* Default Requests[resource] - defaults container.resources.requests[resource] to specified value if none

[[pod-limits]]
=== Pod Limits

*Supported Resources:*

* CPU
* Memory

*Supported Constraints:*

Across all containers in a pod, the following must hold true:

.Pod
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Constraint |Enforced Behavior

|`*Min*`
|Min[resource] less than or equal to container.resources.requests[resource] (required) less than or equal to container.resources.limits[resource] (optional)

|`*Max*`
|container.resources.limits[resource] (required) less than or equal to Max[resource]

|`*MaxLimitRequestRatio*`
|MaxLimitRequestRatio[resource] less than or equal to ( container.resources.limits[resource] / container.resources.requests[resource])

[[creating-a-limit-range]]
== Creating a Limit Range

To apply a limit range to a project, create a link:#limit-range-def[limit range
object definition] on your file system to your desired specifications, then run:

----
$ oc create -f <limit_range_file>
----

[[viewing-limits]]
== Viewing Limits

To view limits enforced in a project:

====
----
$ oc get limits
NAME
limits

$ oc describe limits limits
Name:        limits
Namespace:   default
Type         Resource  Min Max Request Limit Limit/Request
----         --------  --- --- ------- ----- -------------
Pod          memory    6Mi 1Gi -       -     -
Pod          cpu       200m  2 -       -     -
Container    cpu       100m  2 200m    300m  10
Container    memory    4Mi 1Gi 100Mi   200Mi -

[[deleting-limits]]
== Deleting Limits

Remove any active limit range to no longer enforce the limits of a project:

----
$ oc delete limits <limit_name>
