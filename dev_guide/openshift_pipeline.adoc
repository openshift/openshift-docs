[[pipeline-overview]]
== Overview

OpenShift Pipelines give you control over building, deploying, and promoting
your applications on OpenShift. Using a combination of the Jenkins Pipeline
Build Strategy, Jenkinsfiles, and the OpenShift Domain Specific Language (DSL)
(provided by the OpenShift Jenkins Client Plug-in), you can create advanced
build, test, deploy, and promote pipelines for any scenario.

[[openshift-jenkins-sync-plugin]]
== OpenShift Jenkins Sync Plugin

This Jenkins plugin keeps OpenShift BuildConfig and Build objects in sync with Jenkins Jobs and Builds.

The OpenShift Jenkins Sync Plugin provides the following:

 * Dynamic job/run creation in Jenkins.
 * Dynamic creation of slave pod templates from ImageStreams, ImageStreamTags, or
 ConfigMaps.
 * Injecting of environment variables.
 * Pipeline visualization in the OpenShift web console.
 * Integration with the Jenkins git plugin, which passes commit information from
 * Synchronizing secrets into Jenkins credential entries
 OpenShift builds to the Jenkins git plugin.

For more information about this plugin, see:

 * https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-sync-plugin/blob/master/README.md[OpenShift Jenkins Sync Plug-in]
 * xref:../using_images/other_images/jenkins.adoc#sync-plug-in[{product-title} Sync Plug-in]

[[openshift-jenkins-Pipeline-plugin]]
== OpenShift Jenkins Client Plug-in

The OpenShift Jenkins Client Plugin is a Jenkins plugin which aims to provide a
readable, concise, comprehensive, and fluent Jenkins Pipeline syntax for rich
interactions with an OpenShift API Server. The plugin leverages the OpenShift
command line tool (`oc`) which must be available on the nodes executing the
script.

The link:https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-client-plugin[OpenShift Jenkins
Client Plug-in] must be installed on your Jenkins master so the OpenShift DSL
will be available to use within the JenkinsFile for your application. This
plug-in is installed and enabled by default when using the OpenShift Jenkins
image.

[[pipeline-openshift-dsl]]
=== OpenShift DSL

The OpenShift Jenkins Client Plug-in provides a fluent-styled DSL for
communicating with the OpenShift API from within the Jenkins slaves. The
OpenShift DSL is based on Groovy syntax and provides methods for
controlling the lifecycle of your application such as create, build, deploy, and
delete.

The full details of the API are embedded within the plug-in's online
documentation within a running Jenkins instance. To find it:

* Create a new Pipeline Item.
* Click *Pipeline Syntax* below the DSL text area.
* From the left navigation menu, click *Global Variables Reference*.


[[jenkins-pipeline-strategy]]
== Jenkins Pipeline Strategy

In order to take advantage of the OpenShift Pipelines within your project, you
will must use the
xref:../dev_guide/builds/build_strategies.adoc#pipeline-strategy-options[Jenkins
Pipeline Build Strategy]. This strategy defaults to using a `jenkinsfile` at the
root of your source repository, but also provides the following configuration
options:

* An inline `jenkinsfile` field within your BuildConfig.
* A `jenkinsfilePath` field within your BuildConfig that references the location
of the `jenkinsfile` to use relative to the source `contextDir`.

[NOTE]
====
The optional `jenkinsfilePath` field specifies the name of the file to use,
relative to the source `contextDir`. If `contextDir` is omitted, it defaults to
the root of the repository. If `jenkinsfilePath` is omitted, it defaults to
`jenkinsfile`.
====

For more detailed information about the Jenkins Pipeline Strategy, see
xref:../dev_guide/builds/build_strategies.adoc#pipeline-strategy-options[Pipeline
Strategy Options].

[[pipeline-jenkinsfile]]
== Jenkinsfile

The `jenkinsfile` utilizes the standard groovy language syntax to allow fine
grained control over the configuration, build, and deployment of your
application.

The `jenkinsfile` can be supplied in one of the following ways:

* A file located within your source code repository.
* Embedded as part of your build configuration using the `jenkinsfile` field.

When using the first option, the `jenkinsfile` must be included in your
applications source code repository at one of the following locations:

* A file named `jenkinsfile` at the root of your repository.
* A file named `jenkinsfile` at the root of the source `contextDir` of your
repository.
* A file name specified via the `jenkinsfilePath` field of the
`JenkinsPiplineStrategy` section of your BuildConfig, which is relative to the
source `contextDir` if supplied, otherwise it defaults to the root of the
repository.

The `jenkinsfile` is executed on the Jenkins slave pod, which must have the
OpenShift Client binaries available if you intend to use the OpenShift DSL.

[[pipeline-configuring-slave-pods]]
=== Configuring Slave Pods

The link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin[Kubernetes
Plug-in] is also pre-installed in the official Jenkins image. This plug-in
allows the Jenkins master to create slave pods on OpenShift and delegate running
jobs to them to achieve scalability as well as providing pods with specific
runtimes for specific jobs.

For more detailed information on configuring slave pods using the Kubernetes
Plug-in, see
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin/blob/master/README.md[Kubernetes
Plug-in].
