== Overview

This page is intended to provide guidance to application developers using
{product-title} on:

. Determining the memory and risk requirements of a containerized application
   component and configuring the container memory parameters to suit those
   requirements.

. Configuring containerized application runtimes (for example, OpenJDK) to adhere
   optimally to the configured container memory parameters.

. Diagnosing and resolving memory-related error conditions associated with
   running in a container.

== Background

It is recommended to read fully the overview of how {product-title} manages
xref:compute_resources.adoc#dev-compute-resources[Compute Resources] before
proceeding.

For the purposes of sizing application memory, the key points are:

* For each kind of resource (memory, cpu, storage), {product-title} allows
  optional *request* and *limit* values to be placed on each container in a
  pod. For the purposes of this page, we are solely interested in memory
  requests and memory limits.

* *Memory request*

  - The memory request value, if specified, influences the {product-title}
    scheduler. The scheduler considers the memory request when scheduling a
    container to a node, then fences off the requested memory on the chosen node
    for the use of the container.

  - If a node’s memory is exhausted, {product-title} prioritizes evicting its
    containers whose memory usage most exceeds their memory request. In serious
    cases of memory exhaustion, the node OOM killer may select and kill a
    process in a container based on a similar metric.

* *Memory limit*

  - The memory limit value, if specified, provides a hard limit on the memory
    that can be allocated across all the processes in a container.

  - If the memory allocated by all of the processes in a container exceeds the
    memory limit, the node OOM killer will immediately select and kill a
    process in the container.

  - If both memory request and limit are specified, the memory limit value must
    be greater than or equal to the memory request.

* *Administration*

  - The cluster administrator may assign quota against the memory request value,
    limit value, both, or neither.

  - The cluster administrator may assign default values for the memory request
    value, limit value, both, or neither.

  - The cluster administrator may override the memory request values that a
    developer specifies, in order to manage cluster overcommit. This occurs on
    OpenShift Online, for example.

[[strategy]]
== Strategy

The steps for sizing application memory on {product-title} are as follows:

. *Determine expected container memory usage*
+
Determine expected mean and peak container memory usage, empirically if
necessary (for example, by separate load testing). Remember to consider all the
processes that may potentially run in parallel in the container: for example,
does the main application spawn any ancillary scripts?

. *Determine risk appetite*
+
Determine risk appetite for eviction. If the risk appetite is low, the
container should request memory according to the expected peak usage plus a
percentage safety margin. If the risk appetite is higher, it may be more
appropriate to request memory according to the expected mean usage.

. *Set container memory request*
+
Set container memory request based on the above. The more accurately the
request represents the application memory usage, the better. If the request is
too high, cluster and quota usage will be inefficient. If the request is too
low, the chances of application eviction increase.

. *Set container memory limit, if required*
+
Set container memory limit, if required. Setting a limit has the effect of
immediately killing a container process if the combined memory usage of all
processes in the container exceeds the limit, and is therefore a mixed blessing.
On the one hand, it may make unanticipated excess memory usage obvious early
("fail fast"); on the other hand it also terminates processes abruptly.
+
Note that some {product-title} clusters may require a limit value to be set;
some may override the request based on the limit; and some application images
rely on a limit value being set as this is easier to detect than a request
value.
+
If the memory limit is set, it should not be set to less than the expected peak
container memory usage plus a percentage safety margin.

. *Ensure application is tuned*
+
Ensure application is tuned with respect to configured request and limit values,
if appropriate. This step is particularly relevant to applications which pool
memory, such as the JVM. The rest of this page discusses this.

[[sizing-openjdk]]
== Sizing OpenJDK on {product-title}

The default OpenJDK settings unfortunately do not work well with containerized
environments, with the result that as a rule, some additional Java memory
settings must always be provided whenever running the OpenJDK in a container.

The JVM memory layout is complex, version dependent, and describing it in detail
is beyond the scope of this documentation. However, as a starting point for
running OpenJDK in a container, at least the following three memory-related
tasks are key:

. Overriding the JVM maximum heap size.

. Encouraging the JVM to release unused memory to the operating system, if
   appropriate.

. Ensuring all JVM processes within a container are appropriately configured.

Optimally tuning JVM workloads for running in a container is beyond the scope of
this documentation, and may involve setting multiple additional JVM options.

[[overriding-the-jvm-maximum-heap-size]]
=== Overriding the JVM Maximum Heap Size

For many Java workloads, the JVM heap is the largest single consumer of memory.
Currently, the OpenJDK defaults to allowing up to 1/4 (1/`-XX:MaxRAMFraction`)
of the compute node’s memory to be used for the heap, regardless of whether the
OpenJDK is running in a container or not. It is therefore *essential* to
override this behaviour, especially if a container memory limit is also set.

There are at least two ways the above can be achieved:

. If the container memory limit is set and the experimental options are
   supported by the JVM, set `-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions
   -XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap`.
+
This sets `-XX:MaxRAM` to the container memory limit, and the maximum heap size
(`-XX:MaxHeapSize` / `-Xmx`) to 1/`-XX:MaxRAMFraction` (1/4 by default).

. Directly override one of `-XX:MaxRAM`, `-XX:MaxHeapSize` or `-Xmx`.
+
This option involves hard-coding a value, but has the advantage of allowing a
safety margin to be calculated.

[[encouraging-the-JVM-to-release-unused-memory]]
=== Encouraging the JVM to Release Unused Memory to the Operating System

By default, the OpenJDK does not aggressively return unused memory to the
operating system. This may be appropriate for many containerized Java
workloads, but notable exceptions include workloads where additional active
processes co-exist with a JVM within a container, whether those additional
processes are native, additional JVMs, or a combination of the two.

The xref:../using_images/other_images/jenkins_slaves.adoc#[{product-title}
Jenkins maven slave image] uses the following JVM arguments to encourage the JVM
to release unused memory to the operating system: `-XX:+UseParallelGC
-XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=5 -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=10 -XX:GCTimeRatio=4
-XX:AdaptiveSizePolicyWeight=90`. These arguments are intended to return heap
memory to the operating system whenever allocated memory exceeds 110% of in-use
memory (`-XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio`), spending up to 20% of CPU time in the garbage
collector (`-XX:GCTimeRatio`). At no time will the application heap allocation
be less than the initial heap allocation (overridden by `-XX:InitialHeapSize` /
`-Xms`). Detailed additional information is available

[[ensuring-all-jvm-processes]]
=== Ensuring All JVM Processes Within a Container Are Appropriately Configured

In the case that multiple JVMs run in the same container, it is essential to
ensure that they are all configured appropriately. For many workloads it will
be necessary to grant each JVM a percentage memory budget, leaving a perhaps
substantial additional safety margin.

Many Java tools use different environment variables (`JAVA_OPTS`, `GRADLE_OPTS`,
`MAVEN_OPTS`, and so on) to configure their JVMs and it can be challenging to ensure
that the right settings are being passed to the right JVM.

The `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` environment variable is always respected by the OpenJDK,
and values specified in `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` will be overridden by other options
specified on the JVM command line. By default, the
xref:../using_images/other_images/jenkins_slaves.adoc#[{product-title} Jenkins
maven slave image] sets `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions
-XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap -Dsun.zip.disableMemoryMapping=true"` to ensure
that these options are used by default for all JVM workloads run in the slave
image. This does not guarantee that additional options are not required, but is
intended to be a helpful starting point.

[[finding-memory-request-limit-within-pod]]
== Finding the Memory Request and Limit From Within a Pod

An application wishing to dynamically discover its memory request and limit from
within a pod should use the
xref:downward_api.adoc#dev-guide-downward-api[Downward API]. The following
snippet shows how this is done.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: test
    image: fedora:latest
    command:
    - sleep
    - "3600"
    env:
    - name: MEMORY_REQUEST
      valueFrom:
        resourceFieldRef:
          containerName: test
          resource: requests.memory
    - name: MEMORY_LIMIT
      valueFrom:
        resourceFieldRef:
          containerName: test
          resource: limits.memory
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 384Mi
      limits:
        memory: 512Mi
----

----
# oc rsh test
$ env | grep MEMORY | sort
MEMORY_LIMIT=536870912
MEMORY_REQUEST=402653184
----

The memory limit value can also be read from inside the container by the
`/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes` file.

[[diagnosing-an-oom-kill]]
== Diagnosing an OOM Kill

{product-title} may kill a process in a container if the total memory usage of
all the processes in the container exceeds the memory limit, or in serious cases
of node memory exhaustion.

When a process is OOM killed, this may or may not result in the container
exiting immediately. If the container PID 1 process receives the *SIGKILL*, the
container will exit immediately. Otherwise, the container behavior is
dependent on the behavior of the other processes.

If the container does not exit immediately, an OOM kill is detectable as
follows:

. A container process exited with code 137, indicating it received a SIGKILL
   signal

. The oom_kill counter in `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.oom_control` is
   incremented

----
$ grep '^oom_kill ' /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.oom_control
oom_kill 0
$ sed -e '' </dev/zero  # provoke an OOM kill
Killed
$ echo $?
137
$ grep '^oom_kill ' /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.oom_control
oom_kill 1
----

If one or more processes in a pod are OOM killed, when the pod subsequently
exits, whether immediately or not, it will have phase *Failed* and reason
*OOMKilled*. An OOM killed pod may be restarted depending on the value of
`restartPolicy`. If not restarted, controllers such as the
ReplicationController will notice the pod’s failed status and create a new pod
to replace the old one.

If not restarted, the pod status is as follows:

----
$ oc get pod test
NAME      READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
test      0/1       OOMKilled   0          1m

$ oc get pod test -o yaml
...
status:
  containerStatuses:
  - name: test
    ready: false
    restartCount: 0
    state:
      terminated:
        exitCode: 137
        reason: OOMKilled
  phase: Failed
----

If restarted, its status is as follows:

----
$ oc get pod test
NAME      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
test      1/1       Running   1          1m

$ oc get pod test -o yaml
...
status:
  containerStatuses:
  - name: test
    ready: true
    restartCount: 1
    lastState:
      terminated:
        exitCode: 137
        reason: OOMKilled
    state:
      running:
  phase: Running
----

[[diagnosing-evicted-pod]]
== Diagnosing an Evicted Pod

{product-title} may evict a pod from its node when the node’s memory is
exhausted. Depending on the extent of memory exhaustion, the eviction may or
may not be graceful. Graceful eviction implies the main process (PID 1) of each
container receiving a SIGTERM signal, then some time later a SIGKILL signal if
the process hasn’t exited already. Non-graceful eviction implies the main
process of each container immediately receiving a SIGKILL signal.

An evicted pod will have phase *Failed* and reason *Evicted*. It will not be
restarted, regardless of the value of `restartPolicy`. However, controllers
such as the ReplicationController will notice the pod’s failed status and create
a new pod to replace the old one.

----
$ oc get pod test
NAME      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
test      0/1       Evicted   0          1m

$ oc get pod test -o yaml
...
status:
  message: 'Pod The node was low on resource: [MemoryPressure].'
  phase: Failed
  reason: Evicted
