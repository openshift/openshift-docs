== Overview

An OpenShift link:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.html[route] exposes a
link:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services[service] at a
host name, like _www.example.com_, so that external clients can reach it by
name.

DNS resolution for a host name is handled separately from routing;
your administrator may have configured a cloud domain that will always
correctly resolve to the OpenShift router, or if using an unrelated
host name you may need to modify its DNS records independently to resolve
to the router.

== Creating Routes

You can create unsecured and secured routes routes using the web console or the
CLI.

Using the web console, you can navigate to the *Browse -> Routes* page, then
click *Create Route* to define and create a route in your project:

.Creating a Route Using the Web Console
image::console_create_route.png["Creating a Route Using the Web Console"]

Using the CLI, the following example creates an unsecured route:

----
$ oc expose svc/frontend --hostname=www.example.com
----

The new route inherits the name from the service unless you specify one
using the `--name` option.

.YAML Definition of the Unsecured Route Created Above

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  host: www.example.com
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: frontend
----
====

Unsecured routes are the default configuration, and are therefore the simplest
to set up.
However,
link:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.html#secured-routes[secured routes]
offer security for connections to remain private.
To create a secured HTTPS route encrypted with a key and certificate
(PEM-format files which you must generate and sign separately), you can use
the `create route` command and optionally provide certificates and a key.

[NOTE]
====
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security[TLS] is the
replacement of SSL for HTTPS and other encrypted protocols.
====

----
$ oc create route edge --service=frontend \
    --cert=${MASTER_CONFIG_DIR}/ca.crt \
    --key=${MASTER_CONFIG_DIR}/ca.key \
    --ca-cert=${MASTER_CONFIG_DIR}/ca.crt \
    --hostname=www.example.com

.YAML Definition of the Secured Route Created Above
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  host: www.example.com
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: frontend
  tls:
    termination: edge
    key: |-
      -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
      [...]
      -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
    certificate: |-
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      [...]
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    caCertificate: |-
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      [...]
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----
====

You can create a secured route without specifying a key and certificate,
in which case the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
link:../install_config/install/deploy_router.html#using-wildcard-dns[router's
default certificate]
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
router's default certificate
endif::[]
will be used for TLS termination.

[NOTE]
====
TLS termination in OpenShift relies on
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication[SNI] for serving
custom certificates. Any non-SNI traffic received on port 443 is handled with
TLS termination and a default certificate, which may not match the requested
host name, resulting in validation errors.

== Creating Routes with Labels

You can create a route based on labels. A explanation how can be found at
link:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#router-sharding

How router sharding is created is explained at
link:../install_config/install/deploy_router.adoc#creating-router-shards[Creating Router Shards]
you need to add the labels for the dedicated routes.

----
$ oc expose svc/low-sla-frontend \
    --hostname=low-sla.example.com \
    --labels='sla=low'
----

Further information on all types of
link:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.html#secured-routes[TLS termination]

routing] are available in the
link:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.html[Architecture section].
