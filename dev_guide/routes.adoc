== Overview

An {product-title} xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-routes[route] exposes
a xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[service] at
a host name, like _www.example.com_, so that external clients can reach it by
name.

DNS resolution for a host name is handled separately from routing;
your administrator may have configured a cloud domain that will always
correctly resolve to the {product-title} router, or if using an unrelated
host name you may need to modify its DNS records independently to resolve
to the router.

== Creating Routes

You can create unsecured and secured routes routes using the web console or the
CLI.

Using the web console, you can navigate to the *Browse -> Routes* page, then
click *Create Route* to define and create a route in your project:

.Creating a Route Using the Web Console
image::console_create_route.png["Creating a Route Using the Web Console"]

Using the CLI, the following example creates an unsecured route:

----
$ oc expose svc/frontend --hostname=www.example.com
----

The new route inherits the name from the service unless you specify one
using the `--name` option.

spec:
  host: www.example.com
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: frontend
----

Unsecured routes are the default configuration, and are therefore the simplest
to set up.
However,
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#secured-routes[secured routes]
offer security for connections to remain private.
To create a secured HTTPS route encrypted with a key and certificate
(PEM-format files which you must generate and sign separately), you can use
the `create route` command and optionally provide certificates and a key.

[NOTE]
====
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security[TLS] is the
replacement of SSL for HTTPS and other encrypted protocols.

$ oc create route edge --service=frontend \
    --cert=${MASTER_CONFIG_DIR}/ca.crt \
    --key=${MASTER_CONFIG_DIR}/ca.key \
    --ca-cert=${MASTER_CONFIG_DIR}/ca.crt \
    --hostname=www.example.com

Currently, password protected key files are not supported. HAProxy prompts for
a password upon starting and does not have a way to automate this process. To
remove a passphrase from a keyfile, you can run:

----
# openssl rsa -in <passwordProtectedKey.key> -out <new.key>
----

You can create a secured route without specifying a key and certificate,
in which case the

xref:../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#using-wildcard-certificates[router's
default certificate]

ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
router's default certificate

will be used for TLS termination.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
[NOTE]
====
TLS termination in {product-title} relies on
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication[SNI] for serving
custom certificates. Any non-SNI traffic received on port 443 is handled with
TLS termination and a default certificate, which may not match the requested
host name, resulting in validation errors.

[[custom-route-and-hosts-and-certificates-restrictions]]
== Restrictions

Custom route hosts are not permitted. Instead, the following host template is
enforced on all user routes:

----
<route-name>-<namespace>.44fs.preview.openshiftapps.com
----

Also, custom certificates are not permitted. Only unencrypted routes, edge
routes using the default certificate, and passthrough routes work. Edge routes
with custom certificates and re-encrypt routes (which necessarily have custom
certificates) do not work.

These restrictions are enforced in the router. Inspecting the route in the
console or using `oc get routes` displays the host and certificates specified by
the user. However, custom hosts are not respected, and routes with custom
certificates do not work.

[[routes-load-balancing-for-AB-testing]]
== Load Balancing for A/B Testing
You can run two versions of an application, and, entirely within
{product-title}, control the percentage of traffic to and from each application
for A/B testing. A/B testing is a method of comparing two versions of an
application against each other to determine which one performs better.

Previously, A/B testing only worked by adding or removing more pods of every
kind (A or B). However, this was not a scalable solution because for lower B
percentages, you would create a large number of pods. Starting in
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
3.3,
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
1.2,
endif::[]
the HAProxy router now supports splitting the traffic coming to a route across
multiple back end services via weighting.

The web console allows users to set the weighting and show balance between them:

image::weighting.png[Visualization of Alternate Back Ends in the Web Console]

If you have two deployments, A and B, or more, then create respective services
for the pods in those deployments and use labels.

The *Route* resource now has an `*alternateBackends*` field, which you can use to
specify *Service*. Use the `*alternateBackends*` and  `*To*` fields to supply
the route with all of the back end deployments grouped as services. Use the
`*weight*` sub-field to specify a relative weight in integers ranging from 0 to
256. This value defaults to 100. The combined value of all the weights sets the
relative proportions of traffic.

When you deploy the route, the router will balance the traffic according to the
weights specified for the services.

To edit the route, run:

----
$ oc edit route <route-name>
----

Then, update the percentage/weight of the services in the `*to*` and
`*alternateBackends*` fields.
