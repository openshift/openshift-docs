== Overview

An {product-title} xref:../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-routes[route] exposes
a xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[service] at
a host name, like _www.example.com_, so that external clients can reach it by
name.

DNS resolution for a host name is handled separately from routing;
your administrator may have configured a cloud domain that will always
correctly resolve to the {product-title} router, or if using an unrelated
host name you may need to modify its DNS records independently to resolve
to the router.

[[creating-routes]]
== Creating Routes

You can create unsecured and secured routes routes using the web console or the
CLI.

Using the web console, you can navigate to the *Routes* page, found under the
*Applications* section of the navigation.

Click *Create Route* to define and create a route in your project:

.Creating a Route Using the Web Console
image::3.7-create-route-form.png["Creating a Route Using the Web Console"]

ifndef::openshift-online[]
Using the CLI, the following example creates an unsecured route:

----
$ oc expose svc/frontend --hostname=www.example.com
----

The new route inherits the name from the service unless you specify one
using the `--name` option.

ifdef::openshift-online[]
Using the CLI, create an unsecured route. For {product-title} Starter, follow this example:

----
$ oc expose svc/frontend
----

For {product-title} Pro, follow this example, with `--hostname` being optional:

----
$ oc expose svc/frontend --hostname=www.example.com
----

The new route inherits the name from the service unless you specify one
using the `--name` option.

For information on configuring routes using the CLI, see xref:../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#route-types[Route Types].

ifndef::openshift-online[]
Unsecured routes are the default configuration, and are therefore the simplest
to set up.
However,
xref:../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#secured-routes[secured routes]
offer security for connections to remain private.
To create a secured HTTPS route encrypted with a key and certificate
(PEM-format files which you must generate and sign separately), you can use
the `create route` command and optionally provide certificates and a key.

Currently, password protected key files are not supported. HAProxy prompts for
a password upon starting and does not have a way to automate this process. To
remove a passphrase from a keyfile, you can run:

Unsecured routes are the default configuration, and are therefore the simplest
to set up.
However,
xref:../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#secured-routes[secured routes]
offer security for connections to remain private.  To create a secured HTTPS route
encrypted with the default certificate for {product-title} {product-version}
you can use the `create route` command.

[NOTE]

For {product-title} Starter:

----
$ oc create route edge --service=frontend
----

For {product-title} Pro, you can use your own certificate and key files from a
CA.  However, you can still omit the certificate and key files if you want to
use the default certificate. With {product-title} Starter, you cannot specify a
certificate and key.

For {product-title} Pro:

----
$ oc create route edge --service=frontend \
    --cert=example.crt \
    --key=example.key \
    --ca-cert=ca.crt \
    --hostname=www.example.com

You can create a secured route without specifying a key and certificate,
in which case the

xref:../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#using-wildcard-certificates[router's
default certificate]
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
router's default certificate

will be used for TLS termination.

[NOTE]
====
TLS termination in {product-title} relies on
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication[SNI] for serving
custom certificates. Any non-SNI traffic received on port 443 is handled with
TLS termination and a default certificate, which may not match the requested
host name, resulting in validation errors.

[[dev-guide-routes-allowing-endpoints-to-control-cookies]]
== Allowing Route Endpoints to Control Cookie Names

{product-title} provides sticky sessions, which enables stateful application
traffic by ensuring all traffic hits the same endpoint. However, if the endpoint
pod terminates, whether through restart, scaling, or a change in configuration,
this statefulness can disappear.

{product-title} can use cookies to configure session persistence. The router
selects an endpoint to handle any user requests, and creates a cookie for the
session. The cookie is passed back in the response to the request and the user
sends the cookie back with the next request in the session. The cookie tells the
router which endpoint is handling the session, ensuring that client requests use
the cookie so that they are routed to the same pod.

You can set a cookie name to overwrite the default, auto-generated one for the
route. This allows the application receiving route traffic to know the cookie
name. By deleting the cookie it can force the next request to re-choose an
endpoint. So, if a server was overloaded it tries to shed the requests from the
client and redistribute them.

. Annotate the route with the desired cookie name:
+
----
$ oc annotate route <route_name> router.openshift.io/<cookie_name>= “-<cookie_annotation>”
----
+
For example, to annotate the cookie name of `my_cookie` to the `my_route` with
the annotation of `my_cookie_anno`:
+
----
$ oc annotate route my_route router.openshift.io/my_cookie= “-my_cookie_anno”
----

. Save the cookie, and access the route:
+
----
$ curl $my_route -k -c /tmp/my_cookie
----


ifdef::openshift-online[]
[[custom-route-and-hosts-and-certificates-restrictions]]
== Restrictions

Routes are restricted in {product-title} Starter, but are not restricted in
{product-title} Pro. Custom route hosts are permitted in {product-title} Pro. If
using {product-title} Starter, the following host template is enforced on all
user routes:

----
<route-name>-<namespace>.<external-address>
----

For example:

----
<route-name>-<namespace>.1d35.starter-us-east-1.openshiftapps.com
----

To determine the external address, run:

----
$ oc get route/<route-name>
----

Custom certificates are permitted in {product-title} Pro. In {product-title}
Starter, only unencrypted routes, edge routes using the default certificate, and
passthrough routes work. Edge and re-encrypt routes with custom certificates do
not work in {product-title} Starter.

These restrictions are enforced by the API.  Attempts to create routes with
custom hosts or certificates will be rejected in {product-title} Starter. In
{product-title} Pro, a default host is provided if the user does not specify a
custom host.

[[update-dns-for-custom-routes]]
== Update DNS for Custom Routes

Once your custom route is created in {product-title} Pro, you must update your
DNS provider by creating a canonical name (CNAME) record. Your CNAME record
should point your custom domain to the {product-title} router as the alias. The
{product-title} router's domain is different for every cluster.

[NOTE]
====
CNAME records cannot be set for a naked domain (`example.com`). A subdomain must
be specified (`www.example.com`).
====

In {product-title} Pro, you can view a created custom route to see the CNAME
record that you must provide to your DNS provider.
