== Overview

An {product-title} xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-routes[route] exposes
a xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[service] at
a host name, like _www.example.com_, so that external clients can reach it by
name.

DNS resolution for a host name is handled separately from routing;
your administrator may have configured a cloud domain that will always
correctly resolve to the {product-title} router, or if using an unrelated
host name you may need to modify its DNS records independently to resolve
to the router.

== Creating Routes

You can create unsecured and secured routes routes using the web console or the
CLI.

Using the web console, you can navigate to the *Browse -> Routes* page, then
click *Create Route* to define and create a route in your project:

.Creating a Route Using the Web Console
image::console_create_route.png["Creating a Route Using the Web Console"]

Using the CLI, the following example creates an unsecured route:

ifndef::openshift-online[]
----
$ oc expose svc/frontend --hostname=www.example.com
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-online[]
----
$ oc expose svc/frontend
----
endif::[]

The new route inherits the name from the service unless you specify one
using the `--name` option.

Unsecured routes are the default configuration, and are therefore the simplest
to set up.
However,
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#secured-routes[secured routes]
offer security for connections to remain private.
To create a secured HTTPS route encrypted with a key and certificate
(PEM-format files which you must generate and sign separately), you can use
the `create route` command and optionally provide certificates and a key.

Currently, password protected key files are not supported. HAProxy prompts for
a password upon starting and does not have a way to automate this process. To
remove a passphrase from a keyfile, you can run:

----
# openssl rsa -in <passwordProtectedKey.key> -out <new.key>

Unsecured routes are the default configuration, and are therefore the simplest
to set up.
However,
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#secured-routes[secured routes]
offer security for connections to remain private.  To create a secured HTTPS route
encrypted with the default certificate for {product-title} {product-version}
you can use the `create route` command.

You can create a secured route without specifying a key and certificate,
in which case the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
xref:../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#using-wildcard-certificates[router's
default certificate]
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
router's default certificate
endif::[]
will be used for TLS termination.

[NOTE]
====
TLS termination in {product-title} relies on
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication[SNI] for serving
custom certificates. Any non-SNI traffic received on port 443 is handled with
TLS termination and a default certificate, which may not match the requested
host name, resulting in validation errors.

xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#path-based-routes[path-based

xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-routes[Architecture section].

[[custom-route-and-hosts-and-certificates-restrictions]]
== Restrictions

Custom route hosts are not permitted. Instead, the following host template is
enforced on all user routes:

----
<route-name>-<namespace>.1d35.starter-us-east-1.openshiftapps.com
----

Also, custom certificates are not permitted. Only unencrypted routes, edge
routes using the default certificate, and passthrough routes work. Edge routes
with custom certificates and re-encrypt routes (which necessarily have custom
certificates) do not work.

These restrictions are enforced in the router. Inspecting the route in the
console or using `oc get routes` displays the host and certificates specified by
the user. However, custom hosts are not respected, and routes with custom
certificates do not work.
