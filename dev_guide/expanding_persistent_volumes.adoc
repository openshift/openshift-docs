[[enabling_expansion_pvc]]
== Enabling Expansion of Persistent Volume Claims

Volume expansion is a Technology Preview feature, and hence, is not enabled by
default in your {product-title} {product-version} cluster. There may be other reasons that
{product-title} administrators wish to enable this feature for certain use
cases.

[NOTE]
====
For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features support scope, see
https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/. 
====

To allow expansion of persistent volume claims (PVC) by {product-title} users,
{product-title} administrators must create or update a StorageClass with
`allowVolumeExpansion` set to `true`. Only PVCs created from that class are
allowed to expand.

Apart from that, {product-title} administrators must enable the
`ExpandPersistentVolumes` feature flag and turn on the
`PersistentVolumeClaimResize` admission controller. Refer to 
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/admission_controllers.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-admission-controllers[Admission Controllers]
for more information on the `PersistentVolumeClaimResize` admission controller.

To enable the feature gate, set `ExpandPersistentVolumes` to `true` across the system:

. Configure node-config.yaml on all nodes in the cluster:
+
----
# cat /etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml
...
kubeletArguments:
...
  feature-gates:
  - ExpandPersistentVolumes=true
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
----

. Enable the `ExpandPersistentVolumes` feature gate on the master API and controller manager:
+
----
# cat /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml
...
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  apiServerArguments:
  ...
  feature-gates:
  - ExpandPersistentVolumes=true

# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-controllers

[[expanding_glusterfs_pvc]]
== Expanding GlusterFS-Based Persistent Volume Claims

Once the {product-title} administrator has created a StorageClass with
`allowVolumeExpansion` set to `true`, you can create a PVC from that class, and
afterwards, whenever needed, you can edit the PVC and request a new size. 

For example:

----
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: gluster-mysql
spec: 
  storageClass: "storageClassWithFlagSet" 
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources: 
    requests:  
      storage: 8Gi <1>
----
<1> You can request an expanded volume by updating `spec.resources.requests`.

[[expanding_file_system_pvc]]
== Expanding Persistent Volume Claims with a File System

Expanding PVCs based on volume types that need file system resizing (such as GCE
PD, EBS, and Cinder) is a two-step process. This process usually involves
expanding volume objects in the CloudProvider, and then expanding the file
system on the actual node.

Expanding the file system on the node only happens when a new pod is started
with the volume.  

The following process assumes that the PVC was previously created from a
StorageClass with `allowVolumeExpansion` set to `true`:

. Edit the PVC and request a new size by editing `spec.resources.requests`. Once
the CloudProvider object has finished resizing, the PVC is set to
`FileSystemResizePending`.

. Type the following command to check the condition:
----
  oc describe pvc <pvc_name>
----

When the CloudProvider object has finished resizing, the persistent volume (PV)
object reflects the newly requested size in `PersistentVolume.Spec.Capacity`. At
this point, you can create or re-create a new pod from the PVC to finish the
file system resizing. Once the pod is running, the newly requested size is
available and `FileSystemResizePending` condition is removed from the PVC.

[[recover_from_resize_failure]]
== Recovering from Failure when Expanding Volumes

If expanding underlying storage fails either on master or node, the
{product-title} administrator can manually recover the PVC state and cancel the resize
requests that are continuously retried by the controller without administrator
intervention.

Currently, this can be done manually by completing the following steps:

. Mark the PV that is bound to the claim (PVC) with the `Retain` reclaim policy. This can be done by editing the PV and changing `persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy` to `Retain`.
. Delete the PVC (it will be recreated later).
. To ensure that the newly created PVC can bind to the PV marked `Retain`, manually edit the PV and delete the `claimRef` entry from the PV specs. This marks the PV as `Available`. For more information about prebinding PVCs, see xref:./persistent_volumes.adoc#persistent-volumes-volumes-and-claim-prebinding[volume and claim prebinding].
. Re-create the PVC in a smaller size or a size that can be allocated by the underlying storage provider. Also, set the `volumeName` field of the PVC to the name of the PV. This binds the PVC to the provisioned PV only.
. Restore the reclaim policy on the PV.
