A Report is an API object that provides a method to manage periodic ETL (Extract Transform and Load) jobs using SQL queries.
They are composed using other Metering resources such as `ReportQueries`, which provide the actual SQL query to run, and `ReportDataSources`, which are what define the data available to the ReportQueries and Reports.

Many use cases are addressed out-of-the-box with the predefined `ReportQueries` and `ReportDataSources` that come installed with metering, so you do not need to define your own unless you have a use-case not covered by what is predefined.
