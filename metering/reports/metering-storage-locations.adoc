A StorageLocation is a custom resource that configures where data will be stored by the reporting-operator. This includes the data collected from Prometheus, and the results produced by generating a Report custom resource.

You only need to configure a StorageLocation if you want to store data in multiple locations, like multiple S3 buckets or both S3 and HDFS, or if they wish to access a database in Hive/Presto that was not created by metering. For most users this is not a requirement, and the xref:../../metering/configuring-metering/metering-about-configuring.adoc#metering-about-configuring[documentation on configuring metering] is sufficent to configure all necessary storage components.

== StorageLocation examples

This first example is what the built-in local storage option looks like. It is configured to use Hive, and by default data is stored wherever Hive is configured to use storage (HDFS, S3, or a ReadWriteMany PVC).

.Local storage example
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metering.openshift.io/v1
kind: StorageLocation
metadata:
  name: hive
  labels:
    operator-metering: "true"
spec:
  hive: <1>
    databaseName: metering <2>
    unmanagedDatabase: false <3>
----

<1> If the `hive` section is present, then the StorageLocation will be configured to store data in Presto by creating the table using Hive server. Only databaseName and unmanagedDatabase are required fields.
<2> The name of the database within hive.
<3> If `true`, then this StorageLocation will not be actively managed, and the databaseName is expected to already exist in Hive. If `false`, this will cause the reporting-operator to create the database in Hive.

The next example uses an AWS S3 bucket for storage. The prefix is appended to the bucket name when constructing the path to use.

.Remote storage example
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metering.openshift.io/v1
kind: StorageLocation
metadata:
  name: example-s3-storage
  labels:
    operator-metering: "true"
spec:
  hive:
    databaseName: example_s3_storage
    unmanagedDatabase: false
    location: "s3a://bucket-name/path/within/bucket" <1>
----
<1> (optional) The filesystem URL for Presto and Hive to use for the database. This can be an `hdfs://` or `s3a://` filesystem URL.

There are some additonal optional fields that can be specified in the `hive` section:

* (optional) defaultTableProperties:  Contains configuration options for creating tables using Hive.
* (optional) fileFormat: The file format used for storing files in the filesystem. See the link:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-StorageFormatsStorageFormatsRowFormat,StorageFormat,andSerDe[Hive Documentation on File Storage Format] for a list of options and more details.
* (optional) rowFormat: Controls the link:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-RowFormats&SerDe[ Hive row format]. This controls how Hive serializes and deserializes rows. See the link:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-RowFormats&SerDe[Hive Documentation on Row Formats and SerDe] for more details.

== Default StorageLocation
If an annotation `storagelocation.metering.openshift.io/is-default` exists and is set to `true` on a StorageLocation resource, then that resource becomes the default storage resource.  Any components with a storage configuration option where StorageLocation is not specified will use the default storage resource. There can only be on default storage resource. If more than one resource with the annotation exists, an error will be logged and the operator will consider there to be no default.
