You can use the *Developer* perspective of the {product-title} web console to create CI/CD Pipelines for your software delivery process.


In the *Developer* perspective:

* Use the *Add* -> *Pipeline* -> *Pipeline Builder* option to create customized Pipelines for your application.
* Use the *Add* -> *From Git* option to create Pipelines using operator-installed Pipeline templates and resources while creating an application on {product-title}.

After you create the Pipelines for your application, you can view and visually interact with the deployed Pipelines in the *Pipelines* view. You can also use the *Topology* view to interact with the Pipelines created using the *From Git* option. You need to apply custom labels to a Pipeline created using the *Pipeline Builder* to see it in the *Topology* view.
