Uninstalling the {pipelines-title} Operator is a two-step process:

. Delete the Custom Resources (CRs) that were added by default when you installed the {pipelines-title} Operator.
. Uninstall the {pipelines-title} Operator.

Uninstalling only the Operator will not remove the {pipelines-title} components created by default when the Operator is installed.
