== Overview

A quickstart is a basic example of an application running on {product-title}.
Quickstarts come in a variety of languages and frameworks, and are defined in a
xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[template], which is constructed from a set
of services, build configurations, and deployment configurations. This template
references the necessary images and source repositories to build and deploy the
application.

To explore a quickstart, create an application from a template. Your
administrator may have already installed these templates in your {product-title}
cluster, in which case you can simply select it from the web console. See the
xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[template] documentation for more information
on how to upload, create from, and modify a template.

Quickstarts refer to a source repository that contains the application source
code. To customize the quickstart, fork the repository and, when creating an
application from the template, substitute the default source repository name
with your forked repository. This results in builds that are performed using
your source code instead of the provided example source. You can then update the
code in your source repository and launch a new build to see the changes
reflected in the deployed application.
