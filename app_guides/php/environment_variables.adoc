OpenShift is using environment variables for injecting information into
applications. It's an effective way how to dynamically reconfigure applications
without the need to change the source code at all and even without the need
to rebuild the application container.

Most common tasks for environment variables is to provide information where
to connect to data stores, etc.

These environment variables are used by the PHP builder for configuration. These
can be set using the `.s2i/environment` file in your repository.
