= Overview of hibernating and resuming cluster (Technology Preview)

As a cluster administrator, you might need to hibernate a {product-title} cluster for a period and resume it later in order to save infrastructure costs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Hibernating a ready cluster and resuming a hibernating cluster are Technology Preview features only. The hibernate and resume features for {product-title} clusters are provided as Technology Preview features as explained in link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7012966[Technical Preview: Hibernating and Resuming Clusters]. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process. 

During the entire period of hibernation and till the resumed cluster is ready, the cluster is in link:https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-service-definition.html#rosa-limited-support_rosa-service-definition[Limited Support] status under {product-title} SLA.  For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Support Scope]

Hibernation shuts down the underlying Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances that are part of the cluster. This allows for saving infrastructure costs in the case of using on-demand EC2 instances or conserving reserved instances (RI) purchases. 

Hibernation is a useful tool for non-critical clusters that do not contain any non-recoverable business data or application services. Hibernation is recommended where other cost-saving features like auto-scaling or complete recreation of clusters through automation are not applicable. Hibernation saves on Amazon EC2 costs, but the cluster may incur additional costs from services such as Amazon EBS and S3. Red Hat subscription continue to accrue during the time the cluster is hibernated. 

[NOTE]
====
The maximum allowed period for hibernation is 60 days or OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) End-of-Life (EOL), whichever is earlier. During the period of hibernation, OpenShift Cluster Manager (OCM) sends up to 3 reminders for resuming. After reaching either 60 days or OCP EOL, the cluster may be unrecoverable, and the only action allowed is deletion.
====

During hibernation:

* Applications are not accessible
* Cluster admin functions except resume are unavailable
* Cluster updates do not happen. You should monitor EOL dates and ensure cluster is updated

[NOTE]
====
If you are unable to successfully resume a hibernating cluster, follow DR strategy.
