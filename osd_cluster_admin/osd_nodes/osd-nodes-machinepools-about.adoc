{product-title} uses machine pools as an elastic, dynamic provisioning method on top of your cloud infrastructure.

The primary resources are machines, machine sets, and machine pools.

include::snippets/pid-limits.adoc[]

== Machines
A machine is a fundamental unit that describes the host for a worker node.

== Machine sets
`MachineSet` resources are groups of compute machines. If you need more machines or must scale them down, change the number of replicas in the machine pool to which the compute machine sets belong.

== Machine pools
Machine pools are a higher level construct to compute machine sets.

A machine pool creates compute machine sets that are all clones of the same configuration across availability zones. Machine pools perform all of the host node provisioning management actions on a worker node. If you need more machines or must scale them down, change the number of replicas in the machine pool to meet your compute needs. You can manually configure scaling or set autoscaling.

By default, a cluster is created with one machine pool. You can add additional machine pools to an existing cluster, modify the default machine pool, and delete machine pools.

Multiple machine pools can exist on a single cluster, and they can each have different types or different size nodes.

== Machine pools in multiple zone clusters
By default, when you create a machine pool in a multiple availability zone (Multi-AZ) cluster, that one machine pool has 3 zones. The machine pool, in turn, creates a total of 3 compute machine sets - one for each zone in the cluster. Each of those compute machine sets manages one or more machines in its respective availability zone.

If you create a new Multi-AZ cluster, the machine pools are replicated to those zones automatically. If you add a machine pool to an existing Multi-AZ, the new pool is automatically created in those zones. Similarly, deleting a machine pool will delete it from all zones.
Due to this multiplicative effect, using machine pools in Multi-AZ cluster can consume more of your project's quota for a specific region when creating machine pools.

=== Deploying a machine pool in a single availability zone within a Multi-AZ cluster
{product-title} on {GCP} users can deploy a single machine pool in a specific availability zone that is part of a Multi-AZ cluster using the {cluster-manager} CLI (`ocm`). This option is especially useful in situations where a desired instance type is not available in all availability zones of a specific region as well as when your cluster does not need more than one of the desired instance types.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot assign the default machine pool to a single availability zone during the provisioning of a Multi-AZ cluster.

.Prerequisites
*  You installed the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads[OpenShift Cluster Manager API command-line interface (`ocm`)].

[IMPORTANT]
====
[subs="attributes+"]
OpenShift Cluster Manager API command-line interface (`ocm`) is a Technology Preview feature only.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Support Scope].

.Procedure

** Deploy a machine pool to a specific availability zone by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
ocm create machine-pool \
  --cluster <cluster_name|cluster_id> \ <1>
  --instance-type <instance_type> \ <2>
  --replicas <number_of_replicas> \ <3>
  --availability-zone <availability_zone> \ <4>
    [flags] \ <5>
   <machine_pool_id> <6>

----
<1> Replace `<cluster_name|cluster_id>` with the name or ID of the cluster that you want to add the machine pool to.
<2> Replace `<instance_type>` with the instance type you want to deploy to the single availability zone.
<3> Replace `<replicas>` with the number of replicas of the selected instance type you want to include in the machine pool.
<4> Replace `<availability_zone>` with the availability zone you want to add the machine pool to.
<5> Optional: Replace [flags] with any additional flags available for machine pool creation.
<6> Replace `<machine_pool_id>` with an ID for your machine pool.

[NOTE]
====
To view the additional flags available for machine pool creation, run the `ocm create machine-pool --help` command.
