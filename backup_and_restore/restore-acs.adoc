You can restore {product-title} from an existing backup by using the `roxctl` command-line interface (CLI).

Depending upon your requirements and the data you have backed up, you can restore from the following types of backups:

. *Restore Central database from the Central database backup*: Use this to recover from a database failure or data corruption event.
It allows you to restore and recover the Central database to its earlier functional state.
. *Restore Central from the Central deployment backup*: Use this if you are migrating Central to another cluster or namespace. This option restores the configurations of your Central installation.

. Depending upon your installation method, you must first restore Central deployment by following the instructions in the following topics:
