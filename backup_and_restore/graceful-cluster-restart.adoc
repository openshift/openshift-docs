This document describes the process to restart your cluster after a graceful shutdown.

Even though the cluster is expected to be functional after the restart, the cluster might not recover due to unexpected conditions, for example:

* etcd data corruption during shutdown
* Node failure due to hardware
* Network connectivity issues

If your cluster fails to recover, follow the steps to xref:../backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state.adoc#dr-restoring-cluster-state[restore to a previous cluster state].

== Prerequisites

* You have xref:../backup_and_restore/graceful-cluster-shutdown.adoc#graceful-shutdown-cluster[gracefully shut down your cluster].

// Restarting the cluster
include::modules/graceful-restart.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

.Additional resources

* See xref:../backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state.adoc#dr-restoring-cluster-state[Restoring to a previous cluster state] for how to use an etcd backup to restore if your cluster failed to recover after restarting.
