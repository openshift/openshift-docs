You might encounter these common issues with `Backup` and `Restore` custom resources (CRs).

[id="backup-cannot-retrieve-volume_{context}"]
== Backup CR cannot retrieve volume

The `Backup` CR displays the following error message: `InvalidVolume.NotFound: The volume ‘vol-xxxx’ does not exist`.

.Cause

The persistent volume (PV) and the snapshot locations are in different regions.

.Solution

. Edit the value of the `spec.snapshotLocations.velero.config.region` key in the `DataProtectionApplication` manifest so that the snapshot location is in the same region as the PV.
. Create a new `Backup` CR.

[id="backup-cr-remains-in-progress_{context}"]
== Backup CR status remains in progress

The status of a `Backup` CR remains in the `InProgress` phase and does not complete.

.Cause

If a backup is interrupted, it cannot be resumed.

.Solution

. Retrieve the details of the `Backup` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n {namespace} exec deployment/velero -c velero -- ./velero \
  backup describe <backup>
----

. Delete the `Backup` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete backups.velero.io <backup> -n openshift-adp
----
+
You do not need to clean up the backup location because an in progress `Backup` CR has not uploaded files to object storage.

. Create a new `Backup` CR.

. View the Velero backup details by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal, subs="+quotes"]
----
$ velero backup describe _<backup-name>_ --details
----

[id="backup-cr-remains-partiallyfailed_{context}"]
== Backup CR status remains in PartiallyFailed

The status of a `Backup` CR without Restic in use remains in the `PartiallyFailed` phase and is not completed. A snapshot of the affiliated PVC is not created.

.Cause

If the backup created based on the CSI snapshot class is missing a label, the CSI snapshot plugin fails to create a snapshot. As a result, the `Velero` pod logs an error similar to the following message:

[source,text]
----
time="2023-02-17T16:33:13Z" level=error msg="Error backing up item" backup=openshift-adp/user1-backup-check5 error="error executing custom action (groupResource=persistentvolumeclaims, namespace=busy1, name=pvc1-user1): rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to get volumesnapshotclass for storageclass ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd: failed to get volumesnapshotclass for provisioner openshift-storage.rbd.csi.ceph.com, ensure that the desired volumesnapshot class has the velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class label" logSource="/remote-source/velero/app/pkg/backup/backup.go:417" name=busybox-79799557b5-vprq
----

.Solution

. Delete the `Backup` CR by running the following command::
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete backups.velero.io <backup> -n openshift-adp
----

. If required, clean up the stored data on the `BackupStorageLocation` to free up space.

. Apply the label `velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class=true` to the `VolumeSnapshotClass` object by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label volumesnapshotclass/<snapclass_name> velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class=true
----

. Create a new `Backup` CR.
