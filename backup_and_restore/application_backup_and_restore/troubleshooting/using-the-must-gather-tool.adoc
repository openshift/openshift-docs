toc::[]

You can collect logs, metrics, and information about {local-product} custom resources by using the `must-gather` tool. The `must-gather` data must be attached to all customer cases.

You can run the `must-gather` tool with the following data collection options:

* Full `must-gather` data collection collects Prometheus metrics, pod logs, and Velero CR information for all namespaces where the OADP Operator is installed.
* Essential `must-gather` data collection collects pod logs and Velero CR information for a specific duration of time, for example, one hour or 24 hours. Prometheus metrics and duplicate logs are not included.
* `must-gather` data collection with timeout. Data collection can take a long time if there are many failed `Backup` CRs. You can improve performance by setting a timeout value.
* Prometheus metrics data dump downloads an archive file containing the metrics data collected by Prometheus.


.Prerequisites

* You have logged in to the {product-title} cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You must use {op-system-base-full} {op-system-version-9} with {oadp-short} 1.4.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the `must-gather` data.
. Run the `oc adm must-gather` command for one of the following data collection options:

* For full `must-gather` data collection, including Prometheus metrics, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image={must-gather-v1-4}
----
+
The data is saved as `must-gather/must-gather.tar.gz`. You can upload this file to a support case on the link:https://access.redhat.com/[Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal].
+
For essential `must-gather` data collection, without Prometheus metrics, for a specific time duration, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image={must-gather-v1-4} \
  -- /usr/bin/gather_<time>_essential <1>
----
<1> Specify the time in hours. Allowed values are `1h`, `6h`, `24h`, `72h`, or `all`, for example, `gather_1h_essential` or `gather_all_essential`.

* For `must-gather` data collection with timeout, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image={must-gather-v1-4} \
  -- /usr/bin/gather_with_timeout <timeout> <1>
----
<1> Specify a timeout value in seconds.

* For a Prometheus metrics data dump, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image={must-gather-v1-4} -- /usr/bin/gather_metrics_dump
----
This operation can take a long time. The data is saved as `must-gather/metrics/prom_data.tar.gz`.
