toc::[]

You can collect logs and information about {oadp-short} custom resources by using the `must-gather` tool. The `must-gather` data must be attached to all customer cases.

The `must-gather` tool is a container and does not run all the time. The tool runs for a few minutes only after you invoke the tool by running the `must-gather` command.
