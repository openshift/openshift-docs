The `DataProtectionTest` (DPT) is a custom resource (CR) that provides a framework to validate your {oadp-short} configuration in the following ways. The DPT CR checks and reports data for the following parameters:

* The upload performance of the backups to the object storage.
* The CSI snapshot readiness for persistent volume claims.
* The storage bucket configuration such as encryption, and versioning for {aws-short} S3 providers.

Using this data in the DPT CR, you can ensure that your data protection environment is properly configured and performing according to the set configuration.
