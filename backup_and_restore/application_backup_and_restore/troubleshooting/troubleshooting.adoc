You can troubleshoot OADP issues by using the following methods:

* Debug Velero custom resources (CRs) by using the xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/troubleshooting/velero-cli-tool.adoc#oadp-debugging-oc-cli_velero-cli-tool[OpenShift CLI tool] or the xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/troubleshooting/velero-cli-tool.adoc#migration-debugging-velero-resources_velero-cli-tool[Velero CLI tool]. The Velero CLI tool provides more detailed logs and information.

* Debug Velero or Restic pod crashes, which are caused due to a lack of memory or CPU by using xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/troubleshooting/pods-crash-or-restart-due-to-lack-of-memory-or-cpu.adoc#pods-crash-or-restart-due-to-lack-of-memory-or-cpu[Pods crash or restart due to lack of memory or CPU].

* Debug issues with Velero and admission webhooks by using xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/troubleshooting/restoring-workarounds-for-velero-backups-that-use-admission-webhooks.adoc#restoring-workarounds-for-velero-backups-that-use-admission-webhooks[Restoring workarounds for Velero backups that use admission webhooks].

* Check xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/troubleshooting/oadp-installation-issues.adoc#oadp-installation-issues[OADP installation issues], xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/troubleshooting/oadp-operator-issues.adoc#oadp-operator-issues[OADP Operator issues], xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/troubleshooting/backup-and-restore-cr-issues.adoc#backup-and-restore-cr-issues[backup and restore CR issues], and xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/troubleshooting/restic-issues.adoc#restic-issues[Restic issues].

* Use the available xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/troubleshooting/oadp-timeouts.adoc#oadp-timeouts[OADP timeouts] to reduce errors, retries, or failures.

* Collect logs and CR information by using the xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/troubleshooting/using-the-must-gather-tool.adoc#using-the-must-gather-tool[`must-gather` tool].

* Monitor and analyze the workload performance with the help of xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/troubleshooting/oadp-monitoring.adoc#oadp-monitoring[OADP monitoring].
