The OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) provides default Velero plugins that are integrated with storage providers to support backup and snapshot operations. You can create link:https://{velero-domain}/docs/v{velero-version}/custom-plugins/[custom plugins] based on the Velero plugins.

OADP also provides plugins for {product-title} resource backups, OpenShift Virtualization resource backups, and Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots.
