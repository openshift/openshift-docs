OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) supports the following features:

[id="oadp-features-backup"]
== Backup

You can use OADP to back up all applications on the cluster, or you can filter the resources by type, namespace, or label.
OADP backs up Kubernetes objects and internal images by saving them as an archive file on object storage. OADP backs up persistent volumes (PVs) by creating snapshots with the native cloud snapshot API or with the Container Storage Interface (CSI).

You back up applications by creating a `Backup` custom resource (CR). See xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/oadp-creating-backup-cr.adoc#oadp-creating-backup-cr-doc[Creating a Backup CR].

If your cloud provider does not support snapshots or if your applications are on NFS data volumes, you can create backups by using Restic. See xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/oadp-backing-up-applications-restic-doc.adoc#oadp-backing-up-applications-restic-doc[Backing up applications with Restic].

[NOTE]
====
You must exclude Operators from the backup of an application for backup and restore to succeed.
====

[id="oadp-features-restore"]
== Restore

You can restore resources and PVs from a backup. You can restore all objects in a backup or filter the objects by namespace, PV, or label.

You restore application backups by creating a `Restore` custom resource (CR). See xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/restoring-applications.adoc#oadp-creating-restore-cr_restoring-applications[Creating a Restore CR].

[NOTE]
====
You must exclude Operators from the backup of an application for backup and restore to succeed.
====

[id="oadp-features-schedule"]
== Schedule

You can schedule backups at specified intervals.

[id="oadp-features-hooks"]
== Hooks

You can use hooks to run commands in a container on a pod, for example, `fsfreeze` to freeze a file system. You can configure a hook to run before or after a backup or restore. Restore hooks can run in an init container or in the application container.
