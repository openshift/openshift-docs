OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) is platform neutral. The information that follows relates only to IBM Power and to {ibmzProductName}.

OADP 1.2.0 and OADP 1.1.0 were tested successfully against {product-title} 4.11 for both IBM Power and {ibmzProductName}. The sections that follow give testing and support information for OADP 1.1.0 in terms of backup locations for these systems.

//bscott-rh - It feels like this whole assembly and its 2 modules could be removed and added as a release note, or just added as a sentence in one of the introductory assemblies stating that Red Hat supports IBM power and Z with OADP version X on all backup locations. I'll leave that up to you to decide but I wanted to give the feedback.
