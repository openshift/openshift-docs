You install the Openshift API for Data Protection (OADP) with Amazon Web Services (AWS) by installing the OADP Operator, configuring AWS for Velero, and then installing the Data Protection Application.

:FeatureName: The CloudStorage API for S3 storage
include::modules/technology-preview.adoc[]

To install the OADP Operator in a restricted network environment, you must first disable the default OperatorHub sources and mirror the Operator catalog. See xref:../../../operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.adoc#olm-restricted-networks[Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks] for details.

If you are not using snapshots or if your storage is NFS, you can create backups with link:https://restic.net/[Restic].
