As a cluster administrator, you install the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) by installing the OADP Operator. The OADP Operator installs link:https://{velero-domain}/docs/v{velero-version}/[Velero {velero-version}].

To back up Kubernetes resources and internal images, you must have object storage as a backup location, such as one of the following storage types:

* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-aws.adoc#installing-oadp-aws[Amazon Web Services]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-azure.adoc#installing-oadp-azure[Microsoft Azure]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-gcp.adoc#installing-oadp-gcp[Google Cloud Platform]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-mcg.adoc#installing-oadp-mcg[Multicloud Object Gateway]
* {ibm-cloud-name} Object Storage S3
* AWS S3 compatible object storage, such as Multicloud Object Gateway or MinIO

You can configure multiple backup storage locations within the same namespace for each individual OADP deployment.

:FeatureName: The `CloudStorage` API, which automates the creation of a bucket for object storage,
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
The `CloudStorage` API is a Technology Preview feature when you use a `CloudStorage` object and want OADP to use the `CloudStorage` API to automatically create an S3 bucket for use as a `BackupStorageLocation`.

The `CloudStorage` API supports manually creating a `BackupStorageLocation` object by specifying an existing S3 bucket. The `CloudStorage` API that creates an S3 bucket automatically is currently only enabled for AWS S3 storage.
====

You can back up persistent volumes (PVs) by using snapshots or a File System Backup (FSB).

To back up PVs with snapshots, you must have a cloud provider that supports either a native snapshot API or Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots, such as one of the following cloud providers:

* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-aws.adoc#installing-oadp-aws[Amazon Web Services]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-azure.adoc#installing-oadp-azure[Microsoft Azure]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-gcp.adoc#installing-oadp-gcp[Google Cloud Platform]
* CSI snapshot-enabled cloud provider, such as xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-ocs.adoc#installing-oadp-ocs[OpenShift Data Foundation]

include::snippets/oadp-ocp-compat.adoc[]

If your cloud provider does not support snapshots or if your storage is NFS, you can back up applications with xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/oadp-backing-up-applications-restic-doc.adoc#backing-up-applications[Backing up applications with File System Backup: Kopia or Restic] on object storage.

You create a default `Secret` and then you install the Data Protection Application.
