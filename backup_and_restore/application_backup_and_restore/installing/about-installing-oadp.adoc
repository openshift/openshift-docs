As a cluster administrator, you install the Openshift API for Data Protection (OADP) by installing the OADP Operator. The OADP Operator installs link:https://{velero-domain}/docs/v1.7/[Velero 1.7].

To back up Kubernetes resources and internal images, you must have object storage as a backup location, such as one of the following storage types:

* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-aws.adoc#installing-oadp-aws[Amazon Web Services]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-azure.adoc#installing-oadp-azure[Microsoft Azure]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-gcp.adoc#installing-oadp-gcp[Google Cloud Platform]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-mcg.adoc#installing-oadp-mcg[Multicloud Object Gateway]
* S3-compatible object storage, such as Noobaa or Minio

You can back up persistent volumes (PVs) by using snapshots or Restic.

To back up PVs with snapshots, you must have a cloud provider that supports either a native snapshot API or Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots, such as one of the following cloud providers:

* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-aws.adoc#installing-oadp-aws[Amazon Web Services]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-azure.adoc#installing-oadp-azure[Microsoft Azure]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-gcp.adoc#installing-oadp-gcp[Google Cloud Platform]
* CSI snapshot-enabled cloud provider, such as xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-ocs.adoc#installing-oadp-ocs[OpenShift Container Storage]

If your cloud provider does not support snapshots or if your storage is NFS, you can back up applications with xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-backing-up-applications-restic_backing-up-applications[Restic].

You create a `Secret` object for your storage provider credentials and then you install the Data Protection Application.
