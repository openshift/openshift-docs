[role="_abstract"]
As a cluster administrator, your primary goal is to ensure the complete recoverability of your stateful applications if there is a disaster. {oadp-first} is the tool you use to accomplish this job, enabling you to safeguard applications, persistent volumes, and critical Kubernetes resources. This guide focuses on the installation and configuration of {oadp-short}, providing you with a clear, step-by-step path to achieving application resilience and maintaining business continuity with confidence.

As a cluster administrator, you install the {oadp-short} by installing the {oadp-short} Operator. The {oadp-short} Operator installs {velero-link}.

== Core Concepts

The installation process involves two main components:

* The {oadp-short} Operator: You install this from the OperatorHub in the {product-title} web console. It is responsible for deploying and managing all {oadp-short} components, including Velero.

* The Data Protection Application (DPA): This custom resource (CR) is a central configuration file. You use it to define your backup and snapshot locations, specify which Velero plugins to use, and set various other installation and performance parameters. Â

To back up Kubernetes resources and internal images, you must have object storage as a backup location, such as one of the following storage types:

* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-aws.adoc#installing-oadp-aws[Amazon Web Services]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-azure.adoc#installing-oadp-azure[Microsoft Azure]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-gcp.adoc#installing-oadp-gcp[Google Cloud Platform]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-mcg.adoc#installing-oadp-mcg[Multicloud Object Gateway]
* {ibm-cloud-name} Object Storage S3
* AWS S3 compatible object storage, such as Multicloud Object Gateway or MinIO

You can configure multiple backup storage locations within the same namespace for each individual OADP deployment.

include::snippets/snip-noobaa-and-mcg.adoc[]

You can back up persistent volumes (PVs) by using snapshots or a File System Backup (FSB).

To back up PVs with snapshots, you must have a cloud provider that supports either a native snapshot API or Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots, such as one of the following cloud providers:

* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-aws.adoc#installing-oadp-aws[Amazon Web Services]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-azure.adoc#installing-oadp-azure[Microsoft Azure]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-gcp.adoc#installing-oadp-gcp[Google Cloud Platform]
* CSI snapshot-enabled cloud provider, such as xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-ocs.adoc#installing-oadp-ocs[OpenShift Data Foundation]

include::snippets/oadp-ocp-compat.adoc[]

If your cloud provider does not support snapshots or if your storage is NFS, you can back up applications with xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/oadp-backing-up-applications-restic-doc.adoc#backing-up-applications[Backing up applications with File System Backup: Kopia or Restic] on object storage.

You create a default `Secret` and then you install the Data Protection Application.
