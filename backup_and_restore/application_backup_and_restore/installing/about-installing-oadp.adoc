[role="_abstract"]
As a cluster administrator, your primary goal is to ensure the complete recoverability of your stateful applications in the event of a disaster. {oadp-first} is the tool you use to accomplish this job, enabling you to safeguard applications, persistent volumes, and critical Kubernetes resources. This guide focuses on the installation and configuration of {oadp-short}, providing you with a clear, step-by-step path to achieving application resilience and maintaining business continuity with confidence.

As a cluster administrator, you install the {oadp-short} by installing the {oadp-short} Operator. The {oadp-short} Operator installs {velero-link}.

== Core Concepts

The installation process involves two main components:

* The {oadp-short} Operator: You install this from the OperatorHub in the {product-title} web console. It is responsible for deploying and managing all {oadp-short} components, including Velero.

* The Data Protection Application (DPA): This custom resource (CR) is a central configuration file. You use it to define your backup and snapshot locations, specify which Velero plugins to use, and set various other installation and performance parameters.

To back up Kubernetes resources and internal images, you must have object storage as a backup location, such as one of the following storage types:

* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-aws.adoc#installing-oadp-aws[Amazon Web Services]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-azure.adoc#installing-oadp-azure[Microsoft Azure]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-gcp.adoc#installing-oadp-gcp[Google Cloud Platform]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-mcg.adoc#installing-oadp-mcg[Multicloud Object Gateway]
* {ibm-cloud-name} Object Storage S3
* AWS S3 compatible object storage, such as Multicloud Object Gateway or MinIO

You can configure multiple backup storage locations within the same namespace for each individual OADP deployment.

:FeatureName: The `CloudStorage` API, which automates the creation of a bucket for object storage,
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
The `CloudStorage` API is a Technology Preview feature when you use a `CloudStorage` object and want OADP to use the `CloudStorage` API to automatically create an S3 bucket for use as a `BackupStorageLocation`.

The `CloudStorage` API supports manually creating a `BackupStorageLocation` object by specifying an existing S3 bucket. The `CloudStorage` API that creates an S3 bucket automatically is currently only enabled for AWS S3 storage.
====

You can back up persistent volumes (PVs) by using snapshots or a File System Backup (FSB).

To back up PVs with snapshots, you must have a cloud provider that supports either a native snapshot API or Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots, such as one of the following cloud providers:

* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-aws.adoc#installing-oadp-aws[Amazon Web Services]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-azure.adoc#installing-oadp-azure[Microsoft Azure]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-gcp.adoc#installing-oadp-gcp[Google Cloud Platform]
* CSI snapshot-enabled cloud provider, such as xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-ocs.adoc#installing-oadp-ocs[OpenShift Data Foundation]

include::snippets/oadp-ocp-compat.adoc[]

If your cloud provider does not support snapshots or if your storage is NFS, you can back up applications with xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/oadp-backing-up-applications-restic-doc.adoc#backing-up-applications[Backing up applications with File System Backup: Kopia or Restic] on object storage.

You create a default `Secret` and then you install the Data Protection Application.
