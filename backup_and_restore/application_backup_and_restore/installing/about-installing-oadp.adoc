To back up Kubernetes resources and internal images, you must have object storage as a backup location, such as one of the following storage types:

* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-aws.adoc#installing-oadp-aws[Amazon Web Services]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-azure.adoc#installing-oadp-azure[Microsoft Azure]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-gcp.adoc#installing-oadp-gcp[Google Cloud Platform]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-mcg.adoc#installing-oadp-mcg[Multicloud Object Gateway]
* AWS S3 compatible object storage, such as Multicloud Object Gateway or MinIO

You can back up persistent volumes (PVs) by using snapshots or Restic.

To back up PVs with snapshots, you must have a cloud provider that supports either a native snapshot API or Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots, such as one of the following cloud providers:

* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-aws.adoc#installing-oadp-aws[Amazon Web Services]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-azure.adoc#installing-oadp-azure[Microsoft Azure]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-gcp.adoc#installing-oadp-gcp[Google Cloud Platform]
* CSI snapshot-enabled cloud provider, such as xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-ocs.adoc#installing-oadp-ocs[OpenShift Data Foundation]

include::snippets/oadp-ocp-compat.adoc[]

If your cloud provider does not support snapshots or if your storage is NFS, you can back up applications with xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/oadp-backing-up-applications-restic-doc.adoc#backing-up-applications[Backing up applications with File System Backup: Kopia or Restic] on object storage.

You create a default `Secret` and then you install the Data Protection Application.
