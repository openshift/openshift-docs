To back up Kubernetes resources and internal images, you must have S3-compatible object storage, such as the following storage providers:

* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-aws.adoc#installing-oadp-aws[Amazon Web Services]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-azure.adoc#installing-oadp-azure[Microsoft Azure]

To back up persistent volumes (PVs) with snapshots, your cloud provider must support either a native snapshot API or Container Snapshot Interface (CSI) snapshots, such as the following providers:

* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-aws.adoc#installing-oadp-aws[Amazon Web Services]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-azure.adoc#installing-oadp-azure[Microsoft Azure]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-gcp.adoc#installing-oadp-gcp[Google Cloud Platform]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-ocs.adoc#oadp-about-vsl_installing-oadp-ocs[Ceph RBD or Ceph FS storage]

If your cloud provider does not support snapshots or if your storage is NFS, you can create backups with link:https://restic.net/[Restic].
