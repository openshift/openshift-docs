You install the Openshift API for Data Protection (OADP) with OpenShift Container Storage (OCS) by installing the OADP Operator, installing the Data Protection Application, and configuring the snapshot location.

To install the OADP Operator in a restricted network environment, you must first disable the default OperatorHub sources and mirror the Operator catalog. See xref:../../../operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.adoc#olm-restricted-networks[Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks] for details.

You can configure xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-mcg.adoc#installing-oadp-mcg[Multicloud Object Gateway] or any S3-compatible object storage as a backup location.

You can configure xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-ocs.adoc#oadp-about-vsl_installing-oadp-ocs[Ceph RBD or Ceph FS storage] as a snapshot location.

If you are not using snapshots or if your storage is NFS, you can create backups with link:https://restic.net/[Restic].
