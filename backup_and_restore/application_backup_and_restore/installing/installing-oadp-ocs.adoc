You install the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) with {rh-storage} by installing the OADP Operator and configuring a backup location and a snapshot location. Then, you install the Data Protection Application.

include::snippets/oadp-mtc-operator.adoc[]

You can configure xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-mcg.adoc#installing-oadp-mcg[Multicloud Object Gateway] or any S3-compatible object storage as a backup location.

:FeatureName: The `CloudStorage` API, which automates the creation of a bucket for object storage,
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

You create a `Secret` for the backup location and then you install the Data Protection Application. For more details, see xref:../../..//backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/oadp-installing-operator.adoc#oadp-installing-operator-doc[Installing the OADP Operator].

To install the OADP Operator in a restricted network environment, you must first disable the default OperatorHub sources and mirror the Operator catalog. For details, see xref:../../../operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.adoc#olm-restricted-networks[Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks].
