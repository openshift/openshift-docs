You install the Openshift API for Data Protection (OADP) with OpenShift Container Storage (OCS) by installing the OADP Operator and configuring a backup location and a snapshot location. Then, you install the Data Protection Application.

You can configure xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-mcg.adoc#installing-oadp-mcg[Multicloud Object Gateway] or any S3-compatible object storage as a backup location in the `DataProtectionApplication` custom resource (CR).

:FeatureName: The `CloudStorage` API for S3 storage
include::modules/technology-preview.adoc[]

If the cloud provider has a native snapshot API, you can configure cloud storage as a snapshot location in the `DataProtectionApplication` CR. You do not need to specify a snapshot location for Restic or Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots.

To install the OADP Operator in a restricted network environment, you must first disable the default OperatorHub sources and mirror the Operator catalog. For details, see xref:../../../operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.adoc#olm-restricted-networks[Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks].

[NOTE]
====
After you install the OADP Operator, you configure object storage as a backup location and cloud storage as a snapshot location, if the cloud provider supports a native snapshot API.

If the cloud provider does not support snapshots or if your storage is NFS, you can create backups with xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-backing-up-applications-restic_backing-up-applications[Restic]. Restic does not require a snapshot location.
