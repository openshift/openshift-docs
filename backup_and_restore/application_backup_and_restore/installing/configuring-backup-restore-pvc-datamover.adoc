A backup PVC is an intermediate persistent volume claim (PVC) to store data during the data movement backup operation. For some storage classes, such as, CephFS, creating a read-only volume from a snapshot results in faster Data Mover backups.

You create a `readonly` backup PVC by using the `nodeAgent.backupPVC` section of the `DataProtectionApplication` (DPA) and setting the `readOnly` access mode to `true`.

You can use the following fields in the `nodeAgent.backupPVC` section of the DPA to configure the backup PVC.

* `storageClass`: The name of the storage class to use for the backup PVC.
* `readOnly`: Indicates if the backup PVC should be mounted as read-only. Setting this field to `true` also requires you to set the `spcNoRelabeling` field to `true`.
* `spcNoRelabeling`: Disables automatic relabeling of the volume if set to `true`. You can set this field to `true` only when `readOnly` is `true`. When the `readOnly` flag is `true`, SELinux relabeling of the volume is not possible. This causes the Data Mover backup to fail. Therefore, when you are using the `readOnly` access mode for the CephFS storage class, you must disable relabeling.
