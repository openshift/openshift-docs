You install the Openshift API for Data Protection (OADP) with Multicloud Object Gateway (MCG) by installing the OADP Operator, creating a `Secret` object, and then installing the Data Protection Application.

MCG is a component of OpenShift Container Storage (OCS). You configure MCG as a backup location in the `DataProtectionApplication` custom resource (CR).

:FeatureName: The `CloudStorage` API for S3 storage
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

If your cloud provider has a native snapshot API, configure a snapshot location. If your cloud provider does not support snapshots or if your storage is NFS, you can create backups with Restic.

You do not need to specify a snapshot location in the `DataProtectionApplication` CR for Restic or Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots.

To install the OADP Operator in a restricted network environment, you must first disable the default OperatorHub sources and mirror the Operator catalog. For details, see xref:../../../operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.adoc#olm-restricted-networks[Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks].
