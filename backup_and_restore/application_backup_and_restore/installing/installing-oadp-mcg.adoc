You install the Openshift API for Data Protection (OADP) with Multicloud Object Gateway (MCG) by installing the OADP Operator, retrieving the MCG credentials, and then installing the Data Protection Application.

MCG is a component of OpenShift Container Storage (OCS). You can configure MCG as a backup location.

To install the OADP Operator in a restricted network environment, you must first disable the default OperatorHub sources and mirror the Operator catalog. See xref:../../../operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.adoc#olm-restricted-networks[Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks] for details.

If you are not using snapshots or if your storage is NFS, you can create backups with link:https://restic.net/[Restic].
