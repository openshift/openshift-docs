You can install the {oadp-first} with {VirtProductName} by installing the OADP Operator and configuring a backup location. Then, you can install the Data Protection Application.

Back up and restore virtual machines by using the xref:../../../backup_and_restore/index.adoc#application-backup-restore-operations-overview[{oadp-full}].

[NOTE]
====
{oadp-full} with {VirtProductName} supports the following backup and restore storage options:

* Container Storage Interface (CSI) backups

* Container Storage Interface (CSI) backups with DataMover

The following storage options are excluded:

* File system backup and restore

* Volume snapshot backups and restores
