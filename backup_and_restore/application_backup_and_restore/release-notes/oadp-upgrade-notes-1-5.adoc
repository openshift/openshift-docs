Learn how to upgrade your existing {oadp-short} 1.4 installation to {oadp-short} 1.5.

[NOTE]
====
Always upgrade to the next minor version. Do not skip versions. To update to a later version, upgrade only one channel at a time. For example, to upgrade from {oadp-short} 1.1 to 1.3, upgrade first to 1.2, and then to 1.3.
