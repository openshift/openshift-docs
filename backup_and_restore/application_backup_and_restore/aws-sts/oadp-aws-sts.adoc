You install the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) with Amazon Web Services (AWS) by installing the OADP Operator. The Operator installs link:https://{velero-domain}/docs/v{velero-version}/[Velero {velero-version}].

include::snippets/oadp-mtc-operator.adoc[]

You configure AWS for Velero, create a default `Secret`, and then install the Data Protection Application. For more details, see xref:../../..//backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/oadp-installing-operator.adoc#oadp-installing-operator-doc[Installing the OADP Operator].

To install the OADP Operator in a restricted network environment, you must first disable the default OperatorHub sources and mirror the Operator catalog. See xref:../../../operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.adoc#olm-restricted-networks[Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks] for details.

You can use {oadp-first} with {product-rosa} (ROSA) clusters to back up and restore application data.

ROSA is a fully-managed, turnkey application platform that allows you to deliver value to your customers by building and deploying applications.

ROSA provides seamless integration with a wide range of {aws-first} compute, database, analytics, machine learning, networking, mobile, and other services to speed up the building and delivery of differentiating experiences to your customers.

You can subscribe to the service directly from your {aws-short} account.

After you create your clusters, you can operate your clusters with the {product-title} web console or through link:https://docs.openshift.com/dedicated/ocm/ocm-overview.html[{cluster-manager-first}]. You can also use ROSA with OpenShift APIs and command-line interface (CLI) tools.

For additional information about ROSA installation, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/products/interactive-walkthrough/install-rosa[Installing Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) interactive walkthrough].

Before installing {oadp-first}, you must set up role and policy credentials for OADP so that it can use the {aws-full} API.

This process is performed in the following two stages:

. Prepare {aws-short} credentials
. Install the OADP Operator and give it an IAM role
