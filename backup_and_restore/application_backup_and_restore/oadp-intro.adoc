The {oadp-first} product safeguards customer applications on {product-title}.

OADP is also capable of backing up both containerized applications and virtual machines (VMs).

However, OADP does not serve as a disaster recovery solution for xref:../../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/backing-up-etcd.adoc#backup-etcd[etcd] or OpenShift Operators.
