With Red Hat 3scale API Management (APIM), you can manage your APIs for internal or external users. Share, secure, distribute, control, and monetize your APIs on an infrastructure platform built with performance, customer control, and future growth in mind.
You can deploy 3scale components on-premise, in the cloud, as a managed service, or in any combination based on your requirement.

[NOTE]
====
In this example, the non-service affecting approach is used to back up and restore 3scale on-cluster storage by using the {oadp-first} Operator.
Additionally, ensure that you are restoring 3scale on the same cluster where it was backed up from. If you want to restore 3scale on a different cluster, ensure that both clusters are using the same custom domain.
