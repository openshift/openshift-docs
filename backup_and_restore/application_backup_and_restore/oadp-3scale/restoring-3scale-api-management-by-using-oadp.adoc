You can restore Red{nbsp}Hat 3scale API Management components by restoring the backed up 3scale operator resources. You can also restore databases such as MySQL and Redis. 

After the data has been restored, you can scale up the 3scale operator and deployment. 

.Prerequisites

* You installed and configured Red{nbsp}Hat 3scale API Management. For more information, see link:{Link3scaleInstalling3scale}#install-threescale-on-openshift-guide[Installing 3scale API Management on OpenShift] and link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_3scale_api_management[Red Hat 3scale API Management].

* You backed up the 3scale operator, and databases such as MySQL and Redis.

* Ensure that you are restoring 3scale on the same cluster where it was backed up from. 

* If you want to restore 3scale on a different cluster, ensure that the original backed-up cluster and the cluster you want to restore the operator on are using the same custom domain.
