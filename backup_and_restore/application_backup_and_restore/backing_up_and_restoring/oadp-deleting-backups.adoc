You can delete a backup by creating the `DeleteBackupRequest` custom resource (CR) or by running the `velero backup delete` command as explained in the following procedures.

The volume backup artifacts are deleted at different times depending on the backup method:

* Restic: The artifacts are deleted in the next full maintenance cycle, after the backup is deleted.
* Container Storage Interface (CSI): The artifacts are deleted immediately when the backup is deleted.
* Kopia: The artifacts are deleted after three full maintenance cycles of the Kopia repository, after the backup is deleted.
