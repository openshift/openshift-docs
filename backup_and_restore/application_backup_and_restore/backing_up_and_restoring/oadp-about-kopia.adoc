Kopia is a fast and secure open-source backup and restore tool that allows you to create encrypted snapshots of your data and save the snapshots to remote or cloud storage of your choice.

Kopia supports network and local storage locations, and many cloud or remote storage locations, including:

* Amazon S3 and any cloud storage that is compatible with S3
* Azure Blob Storage
* Google Cloud Storage platform

Kopia uses content-addressable storage for snapshots:

* Snapshots are always incremental; data that is already included in previous snapshots is not re-uploaded to the repository. A file is only uploaded to the repository again if it is modified.
* Stored data is deduplicated; if multiple copies of the same file exist, only one of them is stored.
* If files are moved or renamed, Kopia can recognize that they have the same content and does not upload them again.

== OADP integration with Kopia

OADP 1.3 supports Kopia as the backup mechanism for pod volume backup in addition to Restic. You must choose one or the other at installation by setting the `uploaderType` field in the `DataProtectionApplication` custom resource (CR). The possible values are `restic` or `kopia`. If you do not specify an  `uploaderType`, OADP 1.3 defaults to using Kopia as the backup mechanism. The data is written to and read from a unified repository.

The following example shows a `DataProtectionApplication` CR configured for using Kopia:
