toc::[]

If your cloud provider does not support snapshots or if your applications are on NFS data volumes, you can create backups by using Restic.

[NOTE]
====
link:https://restic.net/[Restic] is installed by the OADP Operator by default.
====

Restic integration with OADP provides a solution for backing up and restoring almost any type of Kubernetes volume. This integration is an addition to OADP’s capabilities, not a replacement for existing functionality.

You back up Kubernetes resources, internal images, and persistent volumes with Restic by editing the `Backup` custom resource (CR).

You do not need to specify a snapshot location in the `DataProtectionApplication` CR.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Restic does not support backing up `hostPath` volumes. For more information, see link:https://{velero-domain}/docs/v{velero-version}/restic/#limitations[additional Restic limitations].
====

.Prerequisites

* You must install the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator.
* You must not disable the default Restic installation by setting `spec.configuration.restic.enable` to `false` in the `DataProtectionApplication` CR.
* The `DataProtectionApplication` CR must be in a `Ready` state.

.Procedure

* Create the `Backup` CR, as in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: <backup>
  labels:
    velero.io/storage-location: default
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  defaultVolumesToRestic: true <1>
...
----
<1> Add `defaultVolumesToRestic: true` to the `spec` block.
