You back up applications by creating a `Backup` custom resource (CR) by using the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP). See xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-creating-backup-cr_backing-up-applications[Creating a Backup CR].

//**Not sure if this is need**//
//oadp-creating-backup-cr_backing-up-applications

The `Backup` CR creates backup files for Kubernetes resources and internal images, on S3 object storage, and snapshots for persistent volumes (PVs), if the cloud provider uses a native snapshot API or the Container Storage Interface (CSI) to create snapshots, such as {rh-storage} 4.

For more information about CSI volume snapshots, see xref:../../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-snapshots.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-snapshots[CSI volume snapshots].

* If your cloud provider has a native snapshot API or supports CSI snapshots], the `Backup` CR backs up persistent volumes (PVs) by creating snapshots. For more information about working with CSI snapshots, see xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-backing-up-pvs-csi_backing-up-applications[Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots].

* * If your cloud provider does not support snapshots or if your applications are on NFS data volumes, you can create backups by using Restic. See xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-backing-up-applications-restic_backing-up-applications[Backing up applications with Restic].

If your cloud provider does not support snapshots or if your applications are on NFS data volumes, you can create backups by using xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-backing-up-applications-restic_backing-up-applications[Restic].

[IMPORTANT]
====
OADP does not support backing up volume snapshots that were created by other software.
====

You can create backup hooks to run commands before or after the backup operation. See xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-creating-backup-hooks_backing-up-applications[Creating backup hooks].

You can schedule backups by creating a `Schedule` CR instead of a `Backup` CR. See xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-scheduling-backups_backing-up-applications[Scheduling backups].

[id="oadp-cleaning-up-after-data-mover-1-1-backup"]
== Cleaning up after a backup using Data Mover with OADP 1.1.

For OADP 1.1, you must perform a data cleanup after you perform a backup using any version of Data Mover.

The cleanup consists of deleting the following resources:

* Snapshots in a bucket
* Cluster resources
* Volume snapshot backups (VSBs) after a backup procedure that is either run by a schedule or is run repetitively

include::modules/oadp-cleaning-up-after-data-mover-snapshots.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

[id="deleting-cluster-resources"]
=== Deleting cluster resources

Data Mover might leave cluster resources whether or not it successfully backs up your container storage interface (CSI) volume snapshots to a remote object store.
