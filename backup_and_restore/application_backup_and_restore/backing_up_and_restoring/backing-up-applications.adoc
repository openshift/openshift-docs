You back up applications by creating a xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-creating-backup-cr_backing-up-applications[`Backup`] custom resource (CR).

The `Backup` CR creates backup files for Kubernetes resources and internal images, on S3 object storage, and snapshots for persistent volumes (PVs), if the cloud provider uses a native snapshot API or the xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-backing-up-pvs-csi_backing-up-applications[Container Storage Interface (CSI)] to create snapshots, such as {rh-storage} 4. For more information, see xref:../../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-snapshots.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-snapshots[CSI volume snapshots].

include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

If your cloud provider has a native snapshot API or supports xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-backing-up-pvs-csi_backing-up-applications[Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots], the `Backup` CR backs up persistent volumes by creating snapshots. For more information, see the xref:../../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-snapshots.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-snapshots-overview_persistent-storage-csi-snapshots[Overview of CSI volume snapshots] in the {product-title} documentation.

If your cloud provider does not support snapshots or if your applications are on NFS data volumes, you can create backups by using xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-backing-up-applications-restic_backing-up-applications[Restic].

You can create xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-creating-backup-hooks_backing-up-applications[backup hooks] to run commands before or after the backup operation.

You can schedule backups by creating a xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-scheduling-backups_backing-up-applications[`Schedule` CR] instead of a `Backup` CR.

[id="oadp-cleaning-up-after-data-mover-1-1-backup"]
== Cleaning up after a backup using Data Mover with OADP 1.1.

For OADP 1.1., you must perform a data cleanup after you perform a backup using any version of Data Mover.

The cleanup consists of deleting the following resources:

* Snapshots in a bucket
* Cluster resources
* Volume snapshot backups (VSBs) after a backup procedure that is either run by a schedule or is run repetitively

include::modules/oadp-cleaning-up-after-data-mover-snapshots.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

[id="deleting-cluster-resources"]
== Deleting cluster resources

Data Mover might leave cluster resources whether or not it successfully backs up your container storage interface (CSI) volume snapshots to a remote object store.
