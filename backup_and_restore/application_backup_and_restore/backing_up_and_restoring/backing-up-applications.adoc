You back up applications by creating a `Backup` custom resource (CR). See xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-creating-backup-cr_backing-up-applications[Creating a Backup CR].

The `Backup` CR creates backup files for Kubernetes resources and internal images, on S3 object storage, and snapshots for persistent volumes (PVs), if the cloud provider uses a native snapshot API or the Container Storage Interface (CSI) to create snapshots, such as {rh-storage} 4.

For more information about CSI volume snapshots, see xref:../../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-snapshots.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-snapshots[CSI volume snapshots].

:FeatureName: The `CloudStorage` API for S3 storage
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

* If your cloud provider has a native snapshot API or supports CSI snapshots, the `Backup` CR backs up persistent volumes (PVs) by creating snapshots. For more information about working with CSI snapshots, see xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-backing-up-pvs-csi_backing-up-applications[Backing up persistent volumes with CSI snapshots].

* If your cloud provider does not support snapshots or if your applications are on NFS data volumes, you can create backups by using Restic. See xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-backing-up-applications-restic_backing-up-applications[Backing up applications with Restic].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {oadp-first} does not support backing up volume snapshots that were created by other software.
====

You can create backup hooks to run commands before or after the backup operation. See xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-creating-backup-hooks_backing-up-applications[Creating backup hooks].

You can schedule backups by creating a `Schedule` CR instead of a `Backup` CR. See xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-scheduling-backups_backing-up-applications[Scheduling backups].

== Using OADP 1.2 Data Mover with Ceph storage

You can use OADP 1.2 Data Mover to backup and restore application data for clusters that use CephFS, CephRBD, or both.

OADP 1.2 Data Mover leverages Ceph features that support large-scale environments. One of these is the shallow copy method, which is available for {product-title} 4.12 and later. This feature supports backing up and restoring `StorageClass` and `AccessMode` resources other than what is found on the source persistent volume claim (PVC).

[IMPORTANT]
====
The CephFS shallow copy feature is a back up feature. It is not part of restore operations.

[id="defining-crs-for-12-data-mover"]
=== Defining custom resources for use with OADP 1.2 Data Mover

When you install {rh-storage-first}, it automatically creates default CephFS and a CephRBD `StorageClass` and `VolumeSnapshotClass` custom resources (CRs). You must define these CRs for use with OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover.

After you define the CRs, you must make several other changes to your environment before you can perform your back up and restore operations.

[id="oadp-cleaning-up-after-data-mover-1-1-backup"]
== Cleaning up after a backup using OADP 1.1 Data Mover

For OADP 1.1 Data Mover, you must perform a data cleanup after you perform a backup.

The cleanup consists of deleting the following resources:

* Snapshots in a bucket
* Cluster resources
* Volume snapshot backups (VSBs) after a backup procedure that is either run by a schedule or is run repetitively

[id="deleting-cluster-resources"]
=== Deleting cluster resources

OADP 1.1 Data Mover might leave cluster resources whether or not it successfully backs up your container storage interface (CSI) volume snapshots to a remote object store.
