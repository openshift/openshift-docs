You can configure one or more backup storage locations (BSLs) in the Data Protection Application (DPA). You can also select the location to store the backup in when you create the backup. With this configuration, you can store your backups in the following ways:

* To different regions
* To a different storage provider

{oadp-short} supports multiple credentials for configuring more than one BSL, so that you can specify the credentials to use with any BSL.
