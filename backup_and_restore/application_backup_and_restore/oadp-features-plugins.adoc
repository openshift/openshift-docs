[role="_abstract"]
{oadp-first}, which is built on the open-source Velero project, is designed to help you accomplish the job of securing your applications. This goes beyond a simple backup; it means you need to protect your data in diverse environments and be ready for any disaster scenario.

{oadp-short}'s extensibility is a major strength that directly supports this job.

It provides a set of core APIs to perform actions like Backup, Restore, and Schedule. The true power, however, comes from its plugins, which enable {oadp-short} to connect to your specific cloud provider, storage system, and application type. This allows you to tailor your data protection strategy to your unique needs.

{oadp-short}'s design, based on the open-source Velero project, allows it to perform several critical jobs:

* Backup: Create point-in-time copies of your application's Kubernetes resources, internal images, and persistent volumes.

* Restore: Recover data from a backup in a disaster scenario or for migration purposes.

* Schedule: Automate recurring backups to ensure continuous data protection.

* Storage Management: Define where your backups and snapshots are stored using BackupStorageLocation and VolumeSnapshotLocation.

{oadp-short} features provide options for backing up and restoring applications.

The default plugins enable Velero to integrate with certain cloud providers and to back up and restore {product-title} resources. Using the right plugin for your environment is essential for a successful data protection strategy.

.Supported plugins and their functions
[width="100%",cols="30%,30%,40%",options="header",]
|===
|Plugin Type |Examples |Function
|Cloud Provider |`aws`, `azure`, `gcp` |Integrates OADP with public
cloud providers to store backups in object storage, such as Amazon S3,
Azure Blob, or Google Cloud Storage.

|Storage-Specific |`csi`, `restic`, `kopia` |Enables advanced storage
features. The csi plugin supports Container Storage Interface snapshots
for more efficient backups. restic and kopia support File System Backups
(FSB) for storage types that do not support native snapshots.

|Application-Specific |`kubevirt` |Provides specialized backup and
restore capabilities for specific applications, such as virtual machines
managed by OpenShift Virtualization.

== OADP support for {ibm-power-title} and {ibm-z-title}

{oadp-short} is platform neutral. The information that follows relates only to {ibm-power-name} and to {ibm-z-name}.

* {oadp-short} {oadp-version-1-3} was tested successfully against {product-title} 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, and 4.15 for both {ibm-power-name} and {ibm-z-name}. The sections that follow give testing and support information for {oadp-short} {oadp-version-1-3} in terms of backup locations for these systems.
* {oadp-short} {oadp-version-1-4} was tested successfully against {product-title} 4.14, 4.15, 4.16, and 4.17 for both {ibm-power-name} and {ibm-z-name}. The sections that follow give testing and support information for {oadp-short} {oadp-version-1-4} in terms of backup locations for these systems.
* {oadp-short} {oadp-version-1-5} was tested successfully against {product-title} 4.19 for both {ibm-power-name} and {ibm-z-name}. The sections that follow give testing and support information for {oadp-short} {oadp-version-1-5} in terms of backup locations for these systems.
