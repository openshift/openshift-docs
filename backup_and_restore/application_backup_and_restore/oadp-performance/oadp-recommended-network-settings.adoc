For a supported experience with {oadp-first}, you should have a stable and resilient network across {OCP-short} nodes, S3 storage, and in supported cloud environments.

To ensure successful backup and restore operations, Red Hat recommends that your network settings meet the following minimum requirements:

* Bandwidth: Greater than 2 MB
* Packet loss: Range 1% to 5%
* Packet corruption: Range 1% to 5%
* Latency: Range 100ms (Â±20ms)

[IMPORTANT]
====
While Red Hat supports standard backup and restore failures, it does not support failures caused by network settings that do not meet the recommended thresholds.
