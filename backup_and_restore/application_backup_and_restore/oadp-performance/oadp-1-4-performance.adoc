The objective of this performance testing was to run regression test cases for backup and restore performance of {oadp-first} 1.4 using File System Backup (FSB) and  Container Storage Interface (CSI).

The majority of CSI and FSB flows showed comparable performance with the previous {oadp-short} 1.3, including the Velero built-in DataMover. 

In the majority of cases tested, the main performance-related difference for this release was related to FSB flows, which showed a significant improvement in the duration of results compared to {oadp-short} versions 1.3.
