// adding a job to be done
The job to be done for a cluster administrator is not just to back up data, but to perform that backup and restoration efficiently, minimizing downtime and resource consumption. The performance of {oadp-short} backup and restore operations is influenced by various factors, including the size and number of resources, the underlying storage system, and network bandwidth.

To accomplish your job of ensuring optimal performance, you need to:

* Identify potential bottlenecks in your system.

* Configure OADP to use parallel processing for multiple volumes.

* Tune resource limits to prevent overloading your cluster.
