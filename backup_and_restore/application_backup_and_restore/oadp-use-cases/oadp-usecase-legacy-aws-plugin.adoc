This procedure is for troubleshooting Signature Does Not Match errors that can occur with S3-compatible storage that uses older S3 APIs. The solution is to configure {oadp-short} to use the legacy-aws Velero plugin.

If you are using an {aws-short} S3-compatible backup storage location, you might get a `SignatureDoesNotMatch` error while backing up your application. This error occurs because some backup storage locations still use the older versions of the S3 APIs, which are incompatible with the newer AWS SDK for Go V2. To resolve this issue, you can use the `legacy-aws` Velero plugin in the `DataProtectionApplication` custom resource (CR). The `legacy-aws` Velero plugin uses the older AWS SDK for Go V1, which is compatible with the legacy S3 APIs, ensuring successful backups.
