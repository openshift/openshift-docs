Applications with persistent storage require a backup solution that can capture both the application's Kubernetes resources and the data stored in its persistent volumes. The {oadp-first} Operator uses Velero and its plugins to ensure a consistent backup of persistent volumes.

The {oadp-short} Operator, which leverages Velero, provides a flexible and powerful solution for backing up and restoring applications on OpenShift Container Platform. It addresses a variety of common use cases, from simple stateless applications to complex applications with internal databases and persistent volumes. The core functionality revolves around creating consistent snapshots of application resources and data, which can then be used for disaster recovery, migration, or restoring to a previous state.

== Key Use Cases

Backing up applications with persistent volumes: This use case is for applications that require storage to be persistent and require a solution that captures both the Kubernetes resources and the data stored in the persistent volumes. {oadp-short}, with the Velero CSI plugin, ensures a consistent backup by taking a snapshot of the volume.

Backing up stateless applications: For applications that do not have persistent data, such as a web front-end, the backup process can be streamlined to only capture the Kubernetes resources. This approach saves both time and storage space by excluding persistent volumes.

Backing up applications with an internal database: Applications with a co-located database require a coordinated backup process to ensure data consistency. OADP addresses this by using pre- and post-backup hooks to put the database into a consistent, read-only state before the snapshot is taken, and then returning it to a normal state afterward.

== Best Practices

* Plan your backup strategy: Identify which applications are stateless, which have persistent volumes, and which have internal databases. This will help you select the most efficient backup method for each application.

* Use hooks for data consistency: For applications with internal databases, always use pre-backup hooks to ensure the data is consistent at the time of the snapshot.

* Verify your backups: Regularly verify that your backups are completing successfully and that you can restore from them. This builds confidence in your disaster recovery plan.
