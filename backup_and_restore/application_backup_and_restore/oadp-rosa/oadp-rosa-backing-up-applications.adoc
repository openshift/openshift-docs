You can use {oadp-first} with {product-rosa} (ROSA) clusters to back up and restore application data.

ROSA is a fully-managed, turnkey application platform that allows you to deliver value to your customers by building and deploying applications.

ROSA provides seamless integration with a wide range of AWS compute, database, analytics, machine learning, networking, mobile, and other services to speed up the building and delivering of differentiating experiences to your customers.

You subscribe to the service directly from your AWS account.

After you create your clusters, you can operate your clusters with the OpenShift web console or through link:https://docs.openshift.com/dedicated/ocm/ocm-overview.html[{cluster-manager-first}]. The ROSA service also uses OpenShift APIs and command-line interface (CLI) tools.

For additional information about ROSA installation, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/products/interactive-walkthrough/install-rosa[Installing Red Hat Openshift Service on AWS (ROSA) interactive walkthrough].

Before installing {oadp-first}, you must set up role and policy credentials for OADP so that it can use the {aws-full} API.

This is a two stage process:

. Prepare AWS credentials
. Install the OADP Operator and give it an IAM role
