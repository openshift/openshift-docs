etcd is the key-value store for {product-title}, which persists the state of all
resource objects.

Back up your cluster's etcd data regularly and store in a secure location
ideally outside the {product-title} environment. Do not take an etcd backup
before the first certificate rotation completes, which occurs 24 hours after
installation, otherwise the backup will contain expired certificates. It is also
recommended to take etcd backups during non-peak usage hours, as it is a
blocking action.

Be sure to take an etcd backup after you upgrade your cluster. This is important because when you restore your cluster, you must use an etcd backup that was taken from the same z-stream release. For example, an {product-title} 4.y.z cluster must use an etcd backup that was taken from 4.y.z.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Back up your cluster's etcd data by performing a single invocation of the backup script on a control plane host (also known as the master host). Do not take a backup for each control plane host.
====

After you have an etcd backup, you can xref:../../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state.adoc#dr-restoring-cluster-state[restore to a previous cluster state].
