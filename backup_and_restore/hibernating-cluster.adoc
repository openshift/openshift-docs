== Prerequisites

* Take an xref:../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/backing-up-etcd.adoc#backing-up-etcd-data_backup-etcd[etcd backup] prior to hibernating the cluster.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
It is important to take an etcd backup before hibernating so that your cluster can be restored if you encounter any issues when resuming the cluster.

For example, the following conditions can cause the resumed cluster to malfunction:

* etcd data corruption during hibernation
* Node failure due to hardware
* Network connectivity issues

If your cluster fails to recover, follow the steps to xref:../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state.adoc#dr-restoring-cluster-state[restore to a previous cluster state].
