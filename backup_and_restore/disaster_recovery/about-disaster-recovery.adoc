The disaster recovery documentation provides information for administrators on
how to recover from several disaster situations that might occur with their
{product-title} cluster. As an administrator, you might need to follow one or
more of the following procedures in order to return your cluster to a working
state.

xref:../../backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-1-infra-recovery.adoc#dr-infrastructure-recovery[Recovering from lost master hosts]::
This solution handles situations where you have lost the majority of your master
hosts, leading to etcd quorum loss and the cluster going offline. As long as you
have taken an etcd backup and have at least one remaining healthy master host,
you can follow this procedure to recover your cluster.

If applicable, you might also need to xref:../../backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-3-expired-certs.adoc#dr-recovering-expired-certs[recover from expired control plane certificates].

[NOTE]
====
If you have a majority of your masters still available and have an etcd quorum, then follow the procedure to xref:../../backup_and_restore/replacing-failed-master.adoc#replacing-failed-master-host[replace a single failed master host].

xref:../../backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state.adoc#dr-restoring-cluster-state[Restoring to a previous cluster state]::
This solution handles situations where you want to restore your cluster to
a previous state, for example, if an administrator deletes something critical.
As long as you have taken an etcd backup, you can follow this procedure to
restore your cluster to a previous state.

If applicable, you might also need to xref:../../backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-3-expired-certs.adoc#dr-recovering-expired-certs[recover from expired control plane certificates].

xref:../../backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-3-expired-certs.adoc#dr-recovering-expired-certs[Recovering from expired control plane certificates]::
This solution handles situations where your control plane certificates have
expired. For example, if you shut down your cluster before the first certificate
rotation, which occurs 24 hours after installation, your certificates will not
be rotated and will expire. You can follow this procedure to recover from
expired control plane certificates.
