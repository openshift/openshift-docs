[id="control-plane-backup-restore-operations-overview"]
== Control plane backup and restore operations

As a cluster administrator, you might need to stop an {product-title} cluster for a period and restart it later. Some reasons for restarting a cluster are that you need to perform maintenance on a cluster or want to reduce resource costs. In {product-title}, you can perform a xref:../backup_and_restore/graceful-cluster-shutdown.adoc#graceful-shutdown-cluster[graceful shutdown of a cluster] so that you can easily restart the cluster later.

You must xref:../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/backing-up-etcd.adoc#backup-etcd[back up etcd data] before shutting down a cluster; etcd is the key-value store for {product-title}, which persists the state of all resource objects. An etcd backup plays a crucial role in disaster recovery. In {product-title}, you can also xref:../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/replacing-unhealthy-etcd-member.adoc#replacing-unhealthy-etcd-member[replace an unhealthy etcd member].

When you want to get your cluster running again, xref:../backup_and_restore/graceful-cluster-restart.adoc#graceful-restart-cluster[restart the cluster gracefully].

[NOTE]
====
A cluster's certificates expire one year after the installation date. You can shut down a cluster and expect it to restart gracefully while the certificates are still valid. Although the cluster automatically retrieves the expired control plane certificates, you must still xref:../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-3-expired-certs.adoc#dr-recovering-expired-certs[approve the certificate signing requests (CSRs)].
====

You might run into several situations where {product-title}  does not work as expected, such as:

* You have a cluster that is not functional after the restart because of unexpected conditions, such as node failure, or network connectivity issues.
* You have deleted something critical in the cluster by mistake.
* You have lost the majority of your control plane hosts, leading to etcd quorum loss.

You can always recover from a disaster situation by xref:../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state.adoc#dr-restoring-cluster-state[restoring your cluster to its previous state] using the saved etcd snapshots.

[id="application-backup-restore-operations-overview"]
== Application backup and restore operations

As a cluster administrator, you can back up and restore applications running on {product-title} by using the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP).

OADP backs up and restores Kubernetes resources and internal images, at the granularity of a namespace, by using link:https://{velero-domain}/docs/v{velero-version}/[Velero {velero-version}]. OADP backs up and restores persistent volumes (PVs) by using snapshots or Restic. For details, see xref:../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/oadp-features-plugins.adoc#oadp-features_oadp-features-plugins[OADP features].

[id="oadp-requirements"]
=== OADP requirements

OADP has the following requirements:

* You must be logged in as a user with a `cluster-admin` role.
* You must have object storage for storing backups, such as one of the following storage types:

** Amazon Web Services
** Microsoft Azure
** Google Cloud Platform
** Multicloud Object Gateway
** S3-compatible object storage, such as Noobaa or Minio

:FeatureName: The `CloudStorage` API for S3 storage
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

* To back up PVs with snapshots, you must have cloud storage that has a native snapshot API or supports Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots, such as the following providers:

** Amazon Web Services
** Microsoft Azure
** Google Cloud Platform
** CSI snapshot-enabled cloud storage, such as Ceph RBD or Ceph FS

[NOTE]
====
If you do not want to back up PVs by using snapshots, you can use link:https://restic.net/[Restic], which is installed by the OADP Operator by default.

[id="backing-up-and-restoring-applications"]
=== Backing up and restoring applications

You back up applications by creating a xref:../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-creating-backup-cr_backing-up-applications[`Backup`] custom resource (CR). You can configure the following backup options:

* xref:../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-creating-backup-hooks_backing-up-applications[Backup hooks] to run commands before or after the backup operation
* xref:../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-scheduling-backups_backing-up-applications[Scheduled backups]
* xref:../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-backing-up-applications-restic_backing-up-applications[Restic backups]

You restore applications by creating a xref:../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/restoring-applications.adoc#oadp-creating-restore-cr_restoring-applications[`Restore`] CR. You can configure xref:../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/restoring-applications.adoc#oadp-creating-restore-hooks_restoring-applications[restore hooks] to run commands in init containers or in the application container during the restore operation.
