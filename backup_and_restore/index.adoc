[id="control-plane-backup-restore-operations-overview"]
== Control plane backup and restore operations

As a cluster administrator, you might need to stop an {product-title} cluster for a period and restart it later. Some reasons for restarting a cluster are that you need to perform maintenance on a cluster or want to reduce resource costs. In {product-title}, you can perform a xref:../backup_and_restore/graceful-cluster-shutdown.adoc#graceful-shutdown-cluster[graceful shutdown of a cluster] so that you can easily restart the cluster later.

You must xref:../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/backing-up-etcd.adoc#backup-etcd[back up etcd data] before shutting down a cluster; etcd is the key-value store for {product-title}, which persists the state of all resource objects. An etcd backup plays a crucial role in disaster recovery. In {product-title}, you can also xref:../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/replacing-unhealthy-etcd-member.adoc#replacing-unhealthy-etcd-member[replace an unhealthy etcd member].

When you want to get your cluster running again, xref:../backup_and_restore/graceful-cluster-restart.adoc#graceful-restart-cluster[restart the cluster gracefully].

[NOTE]
====
A cluster's certificates expire one year after the installation date. You can shut down a cluster and expect it to restart gracefully while the certificates are still valid. Although the cluster automatically retrieves the expired control plane certificates, you must still xref:../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-3-expired-certs.adoc#dr-recovering-expired-certs[approve the certificate signing requests (CSRs)].
====

You might run into several situations where {product-title}  does not work as expected, such as:

* You have a cluster that is not functional after the restart because of unexpected conditions, such as node failure, or network connectivity issues.
* You have deleted something critical in the cluster by mistake.
* You have lost the majority of your control plane hosts, leading to etcd quorum loss.

You can always recover from a disaster situation by xref:../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state.adoc#dr-restoring-cluster-state[restoring your cluster to its previous state] using the saved etcd snapshots.

[id="application-backup-restore-operations-overview"]
== Application backup and restore operations

As a cluster administrator, you can back up and restore applications running on {product-title} by using the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP).

// Velero 1.7 is no longer latest version. However, it is the officially supported version, so do not change the version number without confirmation from PM.
OADP backs up and restores Kubernetes resources and internal images, at the granularity of a namespace, by using link:https://{velero-domain}/docs/v1.7/[Velero 1.7]. OADP backs up and restores persistent volumes (PVs) by using snapshots or Restic. For details, see xref:../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/oadp-features-plugins.adoc#oadp-features_oadp-features-plugins[OADP features].

[id="oadp-requirements"]
=== OADP requirements

OADP has the following requirements:

* You must be logged in as a user with a `cluster-admin` role.
* You must have object storage for storing backups, such as one of the following storage types:

** OpenShift Data Foundation
** Amazon Web Services
** Microsoft Azure
** Google Cloud Platform
** S3-compatible object storage

:FeatureName: The `CloudStorage` API for S3 storage
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

* To back up PVs with snapshots, you must have cloud storage that has a native snapshot API or supports Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots, such as the following providers:

** Amazon Web Services
** Microsoft Azure
** Google Cloud Platform
** CSI snapshot-enabled cloud storage, such as Ceph RBD or Ceph FS

[NOTE]
====
If you do not want to back up PVs by using snapshots, you can use link:https://restic.net/[Restic], which is installed by the OADP Operator by default.

[id="backing-up-and-restoring-applications"]
=== Backing up and restoring applications

You back up applications by creating a xref:../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-creating-backup-cr_backing-up-applications[`Backup`] custom resource (CR). You can configure the following backup options:

* xref:../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-creating-backup-hooks_backing-up-applications[Backup hooks] to run commands before or after the backup operation
* xref:../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-scheduling-backups_backing-up-applications[Scheduled backups]
* xref:../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-backing-up-applications-restic_backing-up-applications[Restic backups]

You restore applications by creating a xref:../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/restoring-applications.adoc#oadp-creating-restore-cr_restoring-applications[`Restore`] CR. You can configure xref:../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/restoring-applications.adoc#oadp-creating-restore-hooks_restoring-applications[restore hooks] to run commands in init containers or in the application container during the restore operation.
