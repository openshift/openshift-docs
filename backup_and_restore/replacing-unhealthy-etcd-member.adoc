toc::[]

This document describes the process to replace a single unhealthy etcd member.

This process depends on whether the etcd member is unhealthy because the machine is not running or the node is not ready, or whether it is unhealthy because the etcd Pod is crashlooping.

[NOTE]
====
If you have lost the majority of your master hosts, leading to etcd quorum loss, then you must follow the disaster recovery procedure to xref:../backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state.adoc#dr-restoring-cluster-state[restore to a previous cluster state] instead of this procedure.

If the TLS certificates are not valid on the member being replaced, then you must follow the procedure to xref:../backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-3-expired-certs.adoc#dr-recovering-expired-certs[recover from expired control plane certificates] instead of this procedure.

.Prerequisites

* Take an xref:../backup_and_restore/backing-up-etcd.adoc#backing-up-etcd-data_backup-etcd[etcd backup] prior to replacing an unhealthy etcd member.

== Replacing the unhealthy etcd member

Depending on the state of your unhealthy etcd member, use one of the following procedures:

* xref:../backup_and_restore/replacing-unhealthy-etcd-member.adoc#restore-replace-stopped-etcd-member_replacing-unhealthy-etcd-member[Replacing an unhealthy etcd member whose machine is not running or whose node is not ready]
