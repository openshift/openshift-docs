toc::[]

After the {ols-long} Operator is installed, configuring and deploying {ols-long} consists of three tasks. First, you create a credential secret using the credentials for your Large Language Model (LLM) provider. Next, you create the `OLSConfig` custom resource (CR) that the Operator uses to deploy the service. Finally, you verify that the {ols-short} service is operating.

[NOTE]
====
The instructions assume that you are installing {ols-long} using the `kubeadmin` user account. If you are using a regular user account with `cluster-admin` privileges, read the section of the documentation that discusses RBAC.
