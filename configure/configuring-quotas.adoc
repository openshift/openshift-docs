As an administrator with the `kueue-batch-admin-role` cluster role, you can use {product-title} to configure quotas to optimize resource allocation and system throughput for user workloads.
You can configure quotas for compute resources such as CPU, memory, pods, and GPU.

You can configure quotas in {product-title} by completing the following steps:

. Configure a cluster queue.
. Configure a resource flavor.
. Configure a local queue.

After you have completed these steps, users can submit their workloads to the local queue as jobs.

The cluster queue is not ready for use until a xref:../configure/configuring-quotas.adoc#configuring-resourceflavors_configuring-quotas[`ResourceFlavor` object] has also been configured.
