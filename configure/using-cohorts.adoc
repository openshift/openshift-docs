You can use cohorts to group cluster queues and determine which cluster queues are able to share borrowable resources with each other.
Borrowable resources are defined as the unused nominal quota of all the cluster queues in a cohort.

Using cohorts can help to optimize resource utilization by preventing under-utilization and enabling fair sharing configurations.
Cohorts can also help to simplify resource management and allocation between teams, because you can group cluster queues for related workloads or for each team.
You can also use cohorts to set resource quotas at a group level to define the limits for resources that a group of cluster queues can consume.
