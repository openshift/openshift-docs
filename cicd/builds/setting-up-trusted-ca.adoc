Use the following sections to set up additional certificate authorities (CA) to be trusted by builds when pulling images from an image registry.

The procedure requires a cluster administrator to create a `ConfigMap` and add additional CAs as keys in the `ConfigMap`.

* The `ConfigMap` must be created in the `openshift-config` namespace.
* `domain` is the key in the `ConfigMap` and `value` is the PEM-encoded certificate.
** Each CA must be associated with a domain. The domain format is `hostname[..port]`.
* The `ConfigMap` name must be set in the `image.config.openshift.io/cluster` cluster scoped configuration resource's `spec.additionalTrustedCA` field.
//* No longer needs single PEM bundle
