{gitops-title} is a declarative way to implement continuous deployment for cloud native applications. {gitops-title} ensures consistency in applications when you deploy them to different clusters in different environments, such as: development, staging, and production. {gitops-title} helps you automate the following tasks:

* Ensure that the clusters have similar states for configuration, monitoring, and storage
* Recover or recreate clusters from a known state
* Apply or revert configuration changes to multiple {product-title} clusters
* Associate templated configuration with different environments
* Promote applications across clusters, from staging to production
