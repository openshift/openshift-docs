You can use infrastructure nodes to prevent additional billing cost against subscription counts.

You can use the {product-title} to run certain workloads on infrastructure nodes installed by the {gitops-title} Operator. This comprises the workloads that are installed by the {gitops-title} Operator by default in the `openshift-gitops` namespace, including the default Argo CD instance in that namespace.

[NOTE]
====
Any other Argo CD instances installed to user namespaces are not eligible to run on infrastructure nodes.
