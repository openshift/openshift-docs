{gitops-title} is an Operator that uses Argo CD as the declarative GitOps engine. It enables GitOps workflows across multicluster OpenShift and Kubernetes infrastructure. Using {gitops-title}, administrators can consistently configure and deploy Kubernetes-based infrastructure and applications across clusters and development lifecycles. {gitops-title} is based on the open source project link:https://argoproj.github.io/cd/[Argo CD] and provides a similar set of features to what the upstream offers, with additional automation, integration into Red Hat {OCP} and the benefits of Red Hatâ€™s enterprise support, quality assurance and focus on enterprise security.

[NOTE]
====
Because {gitops-title} releases on a different cadence from {product-title}, the {gitops-title} documentation is now available as a separate documentation set at link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_gitops[Red Hat OpenShift GitOps].
