= Build Controllers

Build or codenamed *build-v2* is an API open-source implementation that build container-images on Kubernetes from a _dockerfile-based_ or a _source-based_ approach.

The whole idea of *Build* is to hide the details of image construction from an application developer, by defining https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/[Custom Resources] that the *Build* understands.

Through the *Build* CRDÂ´s the user can specify a desired popular strategy, like *source-to-image*, *buildpack-v3*, *kaniko*, *jib* and *buildah*, in order to build an image.

From a high-level perspective:

* xref:build.adoc[`Build`] hosts the user provide information. This defines the strategy, source input and the desired output(_e.g. container registry_).
* xref:buildrun.adoc[`BuildRun`] hosts the details of an image construction, abstracting this from the user and taking advantage of the Tekton Pipelines task to build the image.
* xref:buildstrategies.adoc[`BuildStrategy`] hosts a list of steps to execute in the Tekton Task definition during the *BuildRun* execution.
* xref:buildstrategies.adoc[`ClusterBuildStrategy`] similar to the *BuildStrategy* but it is _cluster-scoped_.
