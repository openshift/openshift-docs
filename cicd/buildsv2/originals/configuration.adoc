== Controller Settings

The controller is installed into Kubernetes with reasonable defaults. However, there are some settings that can be overridden using environment variables in link:../deploy/500-controller.yaml[`controller.yaml`].

The following environment variables are available:

|===
| Environment Variable | Description

| `CTX_TIMEOUT`
| Override the default context timeout used for all Custom Resource Definition reconciliation operations.

| `REMOTE_ARTIFACTS_CONTAINER_IMAGE`
| Specify the container image used for the `.spec.sources` remote artifacts download, by default it uses `busybox:latest`.

| `GIT_CONTAINER_TEMPLATE`
| JSON representation of a https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/api/core/v1#Container[Container] template that is used for steps that clone a Git repository. Default is `{"image":"ghcr.io/shipwright-io/build/git:latest", "command":["/ko-app/git"], "securityContext":{"runAsUser":1000,"runAsGroup":1000}}`. The following properties are ignored as they are set by the controller: `args`, `name`.

| `GIT_CONTAINER_IMAGE`
| Custom container image for Git clone steps. If `GIT_CONTAINER_TEMPLATE` is also specifying an image, then the value for `GIT_CONTAINER_IMAGE` has precedence.

| `MUTATE_IMAGE_CONTAINER_TEMPLATE`
| JSON representation of a https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/api/core/v1#Container[Container] template that is used for steps that mutates an image if a `Build` has annotations or labels defined in the output. Default is `{"image": "ghcr.io/shipwright-io/build/mutate-image:latest", "command": ["/ko-app/mutate-image"], "env": [{"name": "HOME","value": "/tekton/home"}], "securityContext": {"runAsUser": 0, "capabilities": {"add": ["DAC_OVERRIDE"]}}}`. The following properties are ignored as they are set by the controller: `args`, `name`.

| `MUTATE_IMAGE_CONTAINER_IMAGE`
| Custom container image that is used for steps that mutates an image if a `Build` has annotations or labels defined in the output. If `MUTATE_IMAGE_CONTAINER_TEMPLATE` is also specifying an image, then the value for `MUTATE_IMAGE_CONTAINER_IMAGE` has precedence.

| `BUILD_CONTROLLER_LEADER_ELECTION_NAMESPACE`
| Set the namespace to be used to store the `shipwright-build-controller` lock, by default it is in the same namespace as the controller itself.

| `BUILD_CONTROLLER_LEASE_DURATION`
| Override the `LeaseDuration`, which is the duration that non-leader candidates will wait to force acquire leadership.

| `BUILD_CONTROLLER_RENEW_DEADLINE`
| Override the `RenewDeadline`, which is the duration that the acting leader will retry refreshing leadership before giving up.

| `BUILD_CONTROLLER_RETRY_PERIOD`
| Override the `RetryPeriod`, which is the duration the LeaderElector clients should wait between tries of actions.

| `BUILD_MAX_CONCURRENT_RECONCILES`
| The number of concurrent reconciles by the build controller. A value of 0 or lower will use the default from the https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/controller#Options[controller-runtime controller Options]. Default is 0.

| `BUILDRUN_MAX_CONCURRENT_RECONCILES`
| The number of concurrent reconciles by the buildrun controller. A value of 0 or lower will use the default from the https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/controller#Options[controller-runtime controller Options]. Default is 0.

| `BUILDSTRATEGY_MAX_CONCURRENT_RECONCILES`
| The number of concurrent reconciles by the buildstrategy controller. A value of 0 or lower will use the default from the https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/controller#Options[controller-runtime controller Options]. Default is 0.

| `CLUSTERBUILDSTRATEGY_MAX_CONCURRENT_RECONCILES`
| The number of concurrent reconciles by the clusterbuildstrategy controller. A value of 0 or lower will use the default from the https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/controller#Options[controller-runtime controller Options]. Default is 0.

| `KUBE_API_BURST`
| Burst to use for the Kubernetes API client. See https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/client-go/rest#Config.Burst[Config.Burst]. A value of 0 or lower will use the default from client-go, which currently is 10. Default is 0.

| `KUBE_API_QPS`
| QPS to use for the Kubernetes API client. See https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/client-go/rest#Config.QPS[Config.QPS]. A value of 0 or lower will use the default from client-go, which currently is 5. Default is 0.

| `TERMINATION_LOG_PATH`
| Path of the termination log. This is where controller application will write the reason of its termination. Default value is `/dev/termination-log`.

| `GIT_ENABLE_REWRITE_RULE`
| Enable Git wrapper to setup a URL `insteadOf` Git config rewrite rule for the respective source URL hostname. Default is `false`.

== Role-based Access Control

The release deployment YAML file includes two cluster-wide roles for using Shipwright Build objects.
The following roles are installed:

* `shpwright-build-aggregate-view`: this role grants read access (get, list, watch) to most Shipwright Build objects.
This includes `BuildStrategy`, `ClusterBuildStrategy`, `Build`, and `BuildRun` objects.
This role is aggregated to the https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#default-roles-and-role-bindings[Kubernetes "view" role].
* `shipwright-build-aggregate-edit`: this role grants write access (create, update, patch, delete) to Shipwright objects that are namespace-scoped.
This includes `BuildStrategy`, `Builds`, and `BuildRuns`.
Read access is granted to all `ClusterBuildStrategy` objects.
This role is aggregated to the https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#default-roles-and-role-bindings[Kubernetes "edit" and "admin" roles].

Only cluster administrators are granted write access to `ClusterBuildStrategy` objects.
This can be changed by creating a separate https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#role-and-clusterrole[Kubernetes `ClusterRole`] with these permissions and binding the role to appropriate users.
