= Build Controller Profiling

The build controller supports a `pprof` profiling mode, which is omitted from the binary by default. To use the profiling, use the controller image that was built with `pprof` enabled.

== Enable `pprof` in the build controller

In the Kubernetes cluster, edit the `shipwright-build-controller` deployment to use the container tag with the `debug` suffix.

[,sh]
----
kubectl --namespace <namespace> set image \
  deployment/shipwright-build-controller \
  shipwright-build-controller="$(kubectl --namespace <namespace> get deployment shipwright-build-controller --output jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[].image}')-debug"
----

== Connect `go pprof` to build controller

Depending on the respective setup, there could be multiple build controller pods for high availability reasons. In this case, you have to look-up the current leader first. The following command can be used to verify the currently active leader:

[,sh]
----
kubectl --namespace <namespace> get configmap shipwright-build-controller-lock --output json \
  | jq --raw-output '.metadata.annotations["control-plane.alpha.kubernetes.io/leader"]' \
  | jq --raw-output .holderIdentity
----

The `pprof` endpoint is not exposed in the cluster and can only be used from inside the container. Therefore, set-up port-forwarding to make the `pprof` port available locally.

[,sh]
----
kubectl --namespace <namespace> port-forward <controller-pod-name> 8383:8383
----

Now, you can setup a local webserver to browse through the profiling data.

[,sh]
----
go tool pprof -http localhost:8080 http://localhost:8383/debug/pprof/heap
----

_Please note:_ For it to work, you have to have `graphviz` installed on your system, for example using `brew install graphviz`, `apt-get install graphviz`, `yum install graphviz`, or similar.
