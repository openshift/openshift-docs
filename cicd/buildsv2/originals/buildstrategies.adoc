== Overview

There are two types of strategies, the `ClusterBuildStrategy` (`clusterbuildstrategies.shipwright.io/v1alpha1`) and the `BuildStrategy` (`buildstrategies.shipwright.io/v1alpha1`). Both strategies define a shared group of steps, needed to fullfil the application build.

A `ClusterBuildStrategy` is available cluster-wide, while a `BuildStrategy` is available within a namespace.

== Available ClusterBuildStrategies

Well-known strategies can be bootstrapped from link:../samples/buildstrategy[here]. The currently supported Cluster BuildStrategy are:

'''

== Buildah

The `buildah` ClusterBuildStrategy consists of using https://github.com/containers/buildah[`buildah`] to build and push a container image, out of a `Dockerfile`. The `Dockerfile` should be specified on the `Build` resource.

=== Installing Buildah Strategy

To install use:

[,sh]
----
kubectl apply -f samples/buildstrategy/buildah/buildstrategy_buildah_cr.yaml
----

'''

== Buildpacks v3

The https://buildpacks.io/[buildpacks-v3] BuildStrategy/ClusterBuildStrategy uses a Cloud Native Builder (https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/builder/[CNB]) container image, and is able to implement https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/lifecycle/[lifecycle commands]. The following CNB images are the most common options:

* https://hub.docker.com/r/heroku/buildpacks/[`heroku/buildpacks:18`]
* https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudfoundry/cnb[`cloudfoundry/cnb:bionic`]
* https://hub.docker.com/r/paketobuildpacks/builder/tags[`docker.io/paketobuildpacks/builder:full`]

=== Installing Buildpacks v3 Strategy

You can install the `BuildStrategy` in your namespace or install the `ClusterBuildStrategy` at cluster scope so that it can be shared across namespaces.

To install the cluster scope strategy, use (below is a heroku example, you can also use paketo sample):

[,sh]
----
kubectl apply -f samples/buildstrategy/buildpacks-v3/buildstrategy_buildpacks-v3-heroku_cr.yaml
----

To install the namespaced scope strategy, use:

[,sh]
----
kubectl apply -f samples/buildstrategy/buildpacks-v3/buildstrategy_buildpacks-v3-heroku_namespaced_cr.yaml
----

'''

== Kaniko

The `kaniko` ClusterBuildStrategy is composed by Kaniko's `executor` https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko[kaniko], with the objective of building a container-image, out of a `Dockerfile` and context directory. The `kaniko-trivy` ClusterBuildStrategy adds https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy[trivy] scanning and refuses to push images with critical vulnerabilities.

=== Installing Kaniko Strategy

To install the cluster scope strategy, use:

[,sh]
----
kubectl apply -f samples/buildstrategy/kaniko/buildstrategy_kaniko_cr.yaml
----

==== Scanning with Trivy

You can also incorporate scanning into the ClusterBuildStrategy. The `kaniko-trivy` ClusterBuildStrategy builds the image with `kaniko`, then scans with https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy[trivy]. The BuildRun will then exit with an error if there is a critical vulnerability, instead of pushing the vulnerable image into the container registry.

To install the cluster scope strategy, use:

[,sh]
----
kubectl apply -f samples/buildstrategy/kaniko/buildstrategy_kaniko-trivy_cr.yaml
----

_Note: doing image scanning is not a substitute for trusting the Dockerfile you are building. The build process itself is also susceptible if the Dockerfile has a vulnerability. Frameworks/strategies such as build-packs or source-to-image (which avoid directly building a Dockerfile) should be considered if you need guardrails around the code you want to build._

'''

== BuildKit

https://github.com/moby/buildkit[BuildKit] is composed of the `buildctl` client and the `buildkitd` daemon. For the `buildkit` ClusterBuildStrategy, it runs on a https://github.com/moby/buildkit#daemonless[daemonless] mode, where both client and ephemeral daemon run in a single container. In addition, it runs without privileges (_https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/master/docs/rootless.md[rootless]_).

=== Cache Exporters

By default, the `buildkit` ClusterBuildStrategy will use caching to optimize the build times. When pushing an image to a registry, it will use the inline export cache, which appends cache information to the image that is built. Please refer to https://github.com/moby/buildkit#export-cache[export-cache docs] for more information. Caching can be disabled by setting the `cache` parameter to `"disabled"`. See link:build.md#defining-paramvalues[Defining ParamValues] for more information.

=== Build-args and secrets

The sample build strategy contains array parameters to set values for https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg[``ARG``s in your Dockerfile], and for https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/#new-docker-build-secret-information[mounts with type=secret]. The parameter names are `build-args` and `secrets`. link:build.md#defining-paramvalues[Defining ParamValues] contains example usage.

=== Multi-platform builds

The sample build strategy contains a `platforms` array parameter that you can set to leverage https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/master/docs/multi-platform.md[BuildKit's support to build multi-platform images]. If you do not set this value, the image is built for the platform that is supported by the `FROM` image. If that image supports multiple platforms, then the image will be built for the platform of your Kubernetes node.

=== Known Limitations

The `buildkit` ClusterBuildStrategy currently locks the following parameters:

* To allow running rootless, it requires both https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/clusters/apparmor/[AppArmor] as well as https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/clusters/seccomp/[SecComp] to be disabled using the `unconfined` profile.

=== Usage in Clusters with Pod Security Standards

The BuildKit strategy contains fields with regards to security settings. It therefore depends on the respective cluster setup and administrative configuration. These settings are:

* Defining the `unconfined` profile for both AppArmor and seccomp as required by the underlying `rootlesskit`.
* The `allowPrivilegeEscalation` settings is set to `true` to be able to use binaries that have the `setuid` bit set in order to run with "root" level privileges. In case of BuildKit, this is required by `rootlesskit` in order to set the user namespace mapping file `/proc/<pid>/uid_map`.
* Use of non-root user with UID 1000/GID 1000 as the `runAsUser`.

These settings have no effect in case Pod Security Standards are not used.

_Please note:_ At this point in time, there is no way to run `rootlesskit` to start the BuildKit daemon without the `allowPrivilegeEscalation` flag set to `true`. Clusters with the `Restricted` security standard in place will not be able to use this build strategy.

=== Installing BuildKit Strategy

To install the cluster scope strategy, use:

[,sh]
----
kubectl apply -f samples/buildstrategy/buildkit/buildstrategy_buildkit_cr.yaml
----

'''

== ko

The `ko` ClusterBuilderStrategy is using https://github.com/google/ko[ko]'s publish command to build an image from a Golang main package.

=== Installing ko Strategy

To install the cluster scope strategy, use:

[,sh]
----
kubectl apply -f samples/buildstrategy/ko/buildstrategy_ko_cr.yaml
----

=== Parameters

The build strategy provides the following parameters that you can set in a Build or BuildRun to control its behavior:

|===
| Parameter | Description | Default

| `go-flags`
| Value for the GOFLAGS environment variable.
| Empty

| `go-version`
| Version of Go, must match a tag from https://hub.docker.com/_/golang?tab=tags[the golang image]
| `1.17`

| `ko-version`
| Version of ko, must be either `latest` for the newest release, or a https://github.com/google/ko/releases[ko release name]
| `latest`

| `package-directory`
| The directory inside the context directory containing the main package.
| `.`

| `target-platform`
| Target platform to be built. For example: `linux/arm64`. Multiple platforms can be provided separated by comma, for example: `linux/arm64,linux/amd64`. The value `all` will build all platforms supported by the base image. The value `current` will build the platform on which the build runs.
| `current`
|===

== Source to Image

This BuildStrategy is composed by https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[`source-to-image`] and https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko[`kaniko`] in order to generate a `Dockerfile` and prepare the application to be built later on with a builder.

`s2i` requires a specially crafted image, which can be informed as `builderImage` parameter on the `Build` resource.

=== Installing Source to Image Strategy

To install the cluster scope strategy use:

[,sh]
----
kubectl apply -f samples/buildstrategy/source-to-image/buildstrategy_source-to-image_cr.yaml
----

=== Build Steps

. `s2i` in order to generate a `Dockerfile` and prepare source-code for image build;
. `kaniko` to create and push the container image to what is defined as `output.image`;

== Strategy parameters

Strategy parameters allow users to parameterize their strategy definition, by allowing users to control the _parameters_ values via the `Build` or `BuildRun` resources.

Users defining _parameters_ under their strategies require to understand the following:

* *Definition*: A list of parameters should be defined under `spec.parameters`. Each list item should consist of a _name_, a _description_, a _type_ (either `"array"` or `"string"`) and optionally a _default_ value (for type=string), or _defaults_ values (for type=array). If no default(s) are provided, then the user must define a value in the Build or BuildRun.
* *Usage*: In order to use a parameter in the strategy steps, use the following syntax for type=string: `$(params.your-parameter-name)`. String parameters can be used in all places in the `buildSteps`. Some example scenarios are:
 ** `image`: to use a custom tag, for example `golang:$(params.go-version)` as it is done in the link:../samples/buildstrategy/ko/buildstrategy_ko_cr.yaml[ko sample build strategy])
 ** `args`: to pass data into your builder command
 ** `env`: to force a user to provide a value for an environment variable.

+
Arrays are referenced using `$(params.your-array-parameter-name[*])`, and can only be used in as the value for `args` or `command` because the defined as arrays by Kubernetes. For every item in the array, an arg will be set. For example, if you specify this in your build strategy step:
+
[,yaml]
----
spec:
  parameters:
    - name: tool-args
      description: Parameters for the tool
      type: array
  buildSteps:
    - name: a-step
      command:
        - some-tool
      args:
        - $(params.tool-args[*])
----
+
If the build user sets the value of tool-args to ["--some-arg", "some-value"], then the Pod will contain these args:
+
[,yaml]
----
spec:
  containers:
    - name: a-step
      args:
      ...
        - --some-arg
        - some-value
----
* *Parameterize*: Any `Build` or `BuildRun` referencing your strategy, can set a value for _your-parameter-name_ parameter if needed.

NOTE: Users can provide parameter values as simple strings or as references to keys in https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/[ConfigMaps] and https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/[Secrets]. If they use a ConfigMap or Secret, then the value can only be used if the parameter is used in the `command`, `args`, or `env` section of the `buildSteps`. For example, the above mentioned scenario to set a step's `image` to `golang:$(params.go-version)` does not allow the usage of ConfigMaps or Secrets.

The following example is from the link:../samples/buildstrategy/buildkit/buildstrategy_buildkit_cr.yaml[BuildKit sample build strategy]. It defines and uses several parameters:

        - $(params.secrets[*])
----

See more information on how to use these parameters in a `Build` or `BuildRun` in the related link:./build.md#defining-paramvalues[documentation].

== System parameters

Contrary to the strategy `spec.parameters`, you can use system parameters and their values defined at runtime when defining the steps of a build strategy to access system information as well as information provided by the user in their Build or BuildRun. The following parameters are available:

|===
| Parameter | Description

| `$(params.shp-source-root)`
| The absolute path to the directory that contains the user's sources.

| `$(params.shp-source-context)`
| The absolute path to the context directory of the user's sources. If the user specified no value for `spec.source.contextDir` in their `Build`, then this value will equal the value for `$(params.shp-source-root)`. Note that this directory is not guaranteed to exist at the time the container for your step is started, you can therefore not use this parameter as a step's working directory.

| `$(params.shp-output-image)`
| The URL of the image that the user wants to push as specified in the Build's `spec.output.image`, or the override from the BuildRun's `spec.output.image`.
|===

== System parameters vs Strategy Parameters Comparison

|===
| Parameter Type | User Configurable | Definition

| System Parameter
| No
| At run-time, by the `BuildRun` controller.

| Strategy Parameter
| Yes
| At build-time, during the `BuildStrategy` creation.
|===

== Securely referencing string parameters

In build strategy steps, string parameters are referenced using `$(params.PARAM_NAME)`. This applies to system parameters, and those parameters defined in the build strategy. You can reference those parameters at many locations in the build steps, such as environment variables values, arguments, image, and more. In the Pod, all `$(params.PARAM_NAME)` tokens will be replaced by simple string replaces. This is safe in most locations but requires your attention when you define an inline script using an argument. For example:

[,yaml]
----
spec:
  parameters:
    - name: sample-parameter
      description: A sample parameter
      type: string
  buildSteps:
    - name: sample-step
      command:
        - /bin/bash
      args:
        - -c
        - |
          set -euo pipefail

          some-tool --sample-argument "$(params.sample-parameter)"
----

This opens the door to script injection, for example if the user sets the `sample-parameter` to `argument-value" && malicious-command && echo "`, the resulting pod argument will look like this:

[,yaml]
----
        - |
          set -euo pipefail

          some-tool --sample-argument "argument-value" && malicious-command && echo ""
----

To securely pass a parameter value into a script-style argument, you can chose between these two approaches:

. Using environment variables. This is used in some of our sample strategies, for example link:../samples/buildstrategy/ko/buildstrategy_ko_cr.yaml[ko], or link:../samples/buildstrategy/buildpacks-v3/buildstrategy_buildpacks-v3_cr.yaml[buildpacks]. Basically, instead of directly using the parameter inside the script, you pass it via environment variable. Using quoting, shells ensure that no command injection is possible:
+
[,yaml]
----
spec:
  parameters:
    - name: sample-parameter
      description: A sample parameter
      type: string
  buildSteps:
    - name: sample-step
      env:
        - name: PARAM_SAMPLE_PARAMETER
          value: $(params.sample-parameter)
      command:
        - /bin/bash
      args:
        - -c
        - |
          set -euo pipefail

          some-tool --sample-argument "${PARAM_SAMPLE_PARAMETER}"
----

. Using arguments. This is used in some of our sample build strategies, for example link:../samples/buildstrategy/buildah/buildstrategy_buildah_cr.yaml[buildah]. Here, you use arguments to your own inline script. Appropriate shell quoting guards against command injection.
+
[,yaml]
----
spec:
  parameters:
    - name: sample-parameter
      description: A sample parameter
      type: string
  buildSteps:
    - name: sample-step
      command:
        - /bin/bash
      args:
        - -c
        - |
          set -euo pipefail

          SAMPLE_PARAMETER="$1"

          some-tool --sample-argument "${SAMPLE_PARAMETER}"
        - --
        - $(params.sample-parameter)
----

== System results

You can optionally store the size and digest of the image your build strategy created to a set of files.

|===
| Result file | Description

| `$(results.shp-image-digest.path)`
| File to store the digest of the image.

| `$(results.shp-image-size.path)`
| File to store the compressed size of the image.
|===

You can look at sample build strategies, such as link:../samples/buildstrategy/kaniko/buildstrategy_kaniko_cr.yaml[Kaniko], or link:../samples/buildstrategy/buildpacks-v3/buildstrategy_buildpacks-v3_cr.yaml[Buildpacks], to see how they fill some or all of the results files.

This information will be available in the `.status.output` field of the BuildRun.

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1alpha1
kind: BuildRun
# [...]
status:
 # [...]
  output:
    digest: sha256:07626e3c7fdd28d5328a8d6df8d29cd3da760c7f5e2070b534f9b880ed093a53
    size: 1989004
  # [...]
----

Additionally, you can store error details for debugging purposes when a BuildRun fails using your strategy.

|===
| Result file | Description

| `$(results.shp-error-reason.path)`
| File to store the error reason.

| `$(results.shp-error-message.path)`
| File to store the error message.
|===

Reason is intended to be a one-word CamelCase classification of the error source, with the first letter capitalized.
Error details are only propagated if the build container terminates with a non-zero exit code.
This information will be available in the `.status.failureDetails` field of the BuildRun.

== Steps Resource Definition

All strategies steps can include a definition of resources(_limits and requests_) for CPU, memory and disk. For strategies with more than one step, each step(_container_) could require more resources than others. Strategy admins are free to define the values that they consider the best fit for each step. Also, identical strategies with the same steps that are only different in their name and step resources can be installed on the cluster to allow users to create a build with smaller and larger resource requirements.

=== Strategies with different resources

If the strategy admins would require to have multiple flavours of the same strategy, where one strategy has more resources that the other. Then, multiple strategies for the same type should be defined on the cluster. In the following example, we use Kaniko as the type:

        requests:
          cpu: 500m
          memory: 1Gi
----

The above provides more control and flexibility for the strategy admins. For `end-users`, all they need to do, is to reference the proper strategy. For example:

=== How does Tekton Pipelines handle resources

The *Build* controller relies on the Tekton https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline[pipeline controller] to schedule the `pods` that execute the above strategy steps. In a nutshell, the *Build* controller creates on run-time a Tekton *TaskRun*, and the *TaskRun* generates a new pod in the particular namespace. In order to build an image, the pod executes all the strategy steps one-by-one.

Tekton manage each step resources *request* in a very particular way, see the https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/tasks.md#defining-steps[docs]. From this document, it mentions the following:

____
The CPU, memory, and ephemeral storage resource requests will be set to zero, or, if specified, the minimums set through LimitRanges in that Namespace, if the container image does not have the largest resource request out of all container images in the Task. This ensures that the Pod that executes the Task only requests enough resources to run a single container image in the Task rather than hoard resources for all container images in the Task at once.
____

=== Examples of Tekton resources management

For a more concrete example, let´s take a look on the following scenarios:

'''

*Scenario 1.*  Namespace without `LimitRange`, both steps with the same resource values.

If we will apply the following resources:

* link:../samples/build/build_buildah_cr.yaml[buildahBuild]
* link:../samples/buildrun/buildrun_buildah_cr.yaml[buildahBuildRun]
* link:../samples/buildstrategy/buildah/buildstrategy_buildah_cr.yaml[buildahClusterBuildStrategy]

We will see some differences between the `TaskRun` definition and the `pod` definition.

For the `TaskRun`, as expected we can see the resources on each `step`, as we previously define on our link:../samples/buildstrategy/buildah/buildstrategy_buildah_cr.yaml[strategy].

[,sh]
----
$ kubectl -n test-build get tr buildah-golang-buildrun-9gmcx-pod-lhzbc -o json | jq '.spec.taskSpec.steps[] | select(.name == "step-buildah-bud" ) | .resources'
{
  "limits": {
    "cpu": "500m",
    "memory": "1Gi"
  },
  "requests": {
    "cpu": "250m",
    "memory": "65Mi"
  }
}

$ kubectl -n test-build get tr buildah-golang-buildrun-9gmcx-pod-lhzbc -o json | jq '.spec.taskSpec.steps[] | select(.name == "step-buildah-push" ) | .resources'
{
  "limits": {
    "cpu": "500m",
    "memory": "1Gi"
  },
  "requests": {
    "cpu": "250m",
    "memory": "65Mi"
  }
}
----

The pod definition is different, while Tekton will only use the *highest* values of one container, and set the rest(lowest) to zero:

[,sh]
----
$ kubectl -n test-build get pods buildah-golang-buildrun-9gmcx-pod-lhzbc -o json | jq '.spec.containers[] | select(.name == "step-step-buildah-bud" ) | .resources'
{
  "limits": {
    "cpu": "500m",
    "memory": "1Gi"
  },
  "requests": {
    "cpu": "250m",
    "ephemeral-storage": "0",
    "memory": "65Mi"
  }
}

$ kubectl -n test-build get pods buildah-golang-buildrun-9gmcx-pod-lhzbc -o json | jq '.spec.containers[] | select(.name == "step-step-buildah-push" ) | .resources'
{
  "limits": {
    "cpu": "500m",
    "memory": "1Gi"
  },
  "requests": {
    "cpu": "0",               <------------------- See how the request is set to ZERO.
    "ephemeral-storage": "0", <------------------- See how the request is set to ZERO.
    "memory": "0"             <------------------- See how the request is set to ZERO.
  }
}
----

In this scenario, only one container can have the `spec.resources.requests` definition. Even when both steps have the same values, only one container will get them, the others will be set to zero.

'''

*Scenario 2.*  Namespace without `LimitRange`, steps with different resources:

If we will apply the following resources:

* link:../samples/build/build_buildah_cr.yaml[buildahBuild]
* link:../samples/buildrun/buildrun_buildah_cr.yaml[buildahBuildRun]
* We will use a modified buildah strategy, with the following steps resources:

        memory: 100Mi  <------ See how we provide more memory to step-buildah-push, compared to the 65Mi of the other step
----

For the `TaskRun`, as expected we can see the resources on each `step`.

The pod definition is different, while Tekton will only use the *highest* values of one container, and set the rest(lowest) to zero:

    "ephemeral-storage": "0",
    "memory": "0"                 <------------------- See how the memory is set to ZERO
  }
}
$ kubectl -n test-build get pods buildah-golang-buildrun-95xq8-pod-mww8d -o json | jq '.spec.containers[] | select(.name == "step-step-buildah-push" ) | .resources'
{

    "ephemeral-storage": "0",
    "memory": "100Mi"               <------------------- See how the memory is preserved on this container
  }
}
----

In the above scenario, we can see how the maximum numbers for resource requests are distributed between containers. The container `step-buildah-push` gets the `100mi` for the memory requests, while it was the one defining the highest number. At the same time, the container `step-buildah-bud` is assigned a `0` for its memory request.

'''

*Scenario 3.*  Namespace *with* a `LimitRange`.

When a `LimitRange` exists on the namespace, `Tekton Pipeline` controller will do the same approach as stated in the above two scenarios. The difference is that for the containers that have lower values, instead of zero, they will get the `minimum values of the LimitRange`.

== Annotations

Annotations can be defined for a BuildStrategy/ClusterBuildStrategy as for any other Kubernetes object. Annotations are propagated to the TaskRun and from there, Tekton propagates them to the Pod. Use cases for this are for example:

* The Kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/#support-traffic-shaping[Network Traffic Shaping] feature looks for the `kubernetes.io/ingress-bandwidth` and `kubernetes.io/egress-bandwidth` annotations to limit the network bandwidth the `Pod` is allowed to use.
* The https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/clusters/apparmor/[AppArmor profile of a container] is defined using the `container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/<container_name>` annotation.

The following annotations are not propagated:

* `kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration`
* `clusterbuildstrategy.shipwright.io/*`
* `buildstrategy.shipwright.io/*`
* `build.shipwright.io/*`
* `buildrun.shipwright.io/*`

A Kubernetes administrator can further restrict the usage of annotations by using policy engines like https://www.openpolicyagent.org/[Open Policy Agent].

== Volumes and VolumeMounts

Build steps can declare a `volumeMount`, which allows data in the provided path to be shared across build steps.
When a `volumeMount` is declared, Shipwright will create an `emptyDir` volume with the corresponding name.
Build steps whose volume mounts share the same name will share the same underlying `emtpyDir` volume.

In a future release, build strategy authors will be able to use other volume types for the volume mounts.
When this feature is introduced, the volume and volume type will need to be explicitly declared.
