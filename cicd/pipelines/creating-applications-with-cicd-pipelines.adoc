With {pipelines-title}, you can create a customized CI/CD solution to build, test, and deploy your application.

To create a full-fledged, self-serving CI/CD pipeline for an application, perform the following tasks:

* Create custom tasks, or install existing reusable tasks.
* Create and define the delivery pipeline for your application.
* Provide a storage volume or filesystem that is attached to a workspace for the pipeline execution, using one of the following approaches:
** Specify a volume claim template that creates a persistent volume claim
** Specify a persistent volume claim
* Create a `PipelineRun` object to instantiate and invoke the pipeline.
* Add triggers to capture events in the source repository.

This section uses the `pipelines-tutorial` example to demonstrate the preceding tasks. The example uses a simple application which consists of:

* A front-end interface, `pipelines-vote-ui`, with the source code in the link:https://github.com/openshift/pipelines-vote-ui/tree/{pipelines-ver}[`pipelines-vote-ui`] Git repository.
* A back-end interface, `pipelines-vote-api`, with the source code in the link:https://github.com/openshift/pipelines-vote-api/tree/{pipelines-ver}[`pipelines-vote-api`]  Git repository.
* The `apply-manifests` and `update-deployment` tasks in the link:https://github.com/openshift/pipelines-tutorial/tree/{pipelines-ver}[`pipelines-tutorial`] Git repository.

== Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} cluster.
* You have installed xref:../../cicd/pipelines/installing-pipelines.adoc#installing-pipelines[{pipelines-shortname}] using the {pipelines-title} Operator listed in the OpenShift OperatorHub. After it is installed, it is applicable to the entire cluster.
* You have installed xref:../../cli_reference/tkn_cli/installing-tkn.adoc#installing-tkn[{pipelines-shortname} CLI].
* You have forked the front-end link:https://github.com/openshift/pipelines-vote-ui/tree/{pipelines-ver}[`pipelines-vote-ui`] and back-end link:https://github.com/openshift/pipelines-vote-api/tree/{pipelines-ver}[`pipelines-vote-api`] Git repositories using your GitHub ID, and have administrator access to these repositories.
* Optional: You have cloned the link:https://github.com/openshift/pipelines-tutorial/tree/{pipelines-ver}[`pipelines-tutorial`] Git repository.
