[role="_abstract"]
{tekton-chains} is a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) controller. You can use it to manage the supply chain security of the tasks and pipelines created using {pipelines-title}.

By default, {tekton-chains} observes all task run executions in your {product-title} cluster. When the task runs complete, {tekton-chains} takes a snapshot of the task runs. It then converts the snapshot to one or more standard payload formats, and finally signs and stores all artifacts. 

To capture information about task runs, {tekton-chains} uses the `Result` and `PipelineResource` objects. When the objects are unavailable, {tekton-chains} the URLs and qualified digests of the OCI images.

[NOTE]
====
The `PipelineResource` object is deprecated and will be removed in a future release; for manual use, the `Results` object is recommended.

== Key features
* You can sign task runs, task run results, and OCI registry images with cryptographic key types and services such as `cosign`.
* You can use attestation formats such as `in-toto`.
* You can securely store signatures and signed artifacts using OCI repository as a storage backend.
