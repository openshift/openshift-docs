You can use the *Pipelines* view in the *Developer* perspective to view a list of all of the pipelines in a project. Selecting a pipeline in this view brings you to the *Pipeline details* page for the pipeline.

The *Pipeline details* page shows the following details for each pipeline:

* The namespace in which the pipeline was created
* The last pipeline run
* The status of the tasks in the pipeline run
* The status of the pipeline run
* The creation time of the last pipeline run

By default, the *Details* tab displays a visual representation of all the `serial`, `parallel`, and `finally` tasks, and `when` expressions in the pipeline. The tasks and the `finally` tasks are listed in the lower right portion of the page.
