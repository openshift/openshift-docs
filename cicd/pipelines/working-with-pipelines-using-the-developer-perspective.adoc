[role="_abstract"]
You can use the *Developer* perspective of the {product-title} web console to create CI/CD pipelines for your software delivery process.

In the *Developer* perspective:

* Use the *Add* -> *Pipeline* -> *Pipeline Builder* option to create customized pipelines for your application.
* Use the *Add* -> *From Git* option to create pipelines using operator-installed pipeline templates and resources while creating an application on {product-title}.

After you create the pipelines for your application, you can view and visually interact with the deployed pipelines in the *Pipelines* view. You can also use the *Topology* view to interact with the pipelines created using the *From Git* option. You need to apply custom labels to a pipeline created using the *Pipeline Builder* to see it in the *Topology* view.

== Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} cluster and have switched to the xref:../../web_console/odc-about-developer-perspective.adoc[*Developer* perspective] in the web console.
* You have the xref:../../cicd/pipelines/installing-pipelines.adoc#installing-pipelines[OpenShift Pipelines Operator installed] in your cluster.
* You are a cluster administrator or a user with create and edit permissions.
* You have created a project.

== Creating OpenShift Pipelines along with applications

To create pipelines along with applications, use the *From Git* option in the *Add+* view of the *Developer* perspective. You can view all of your available pipelines and select the pipelines you want to use to create applications while importing your code or deploying an image.

The Tekton Hub Integration is enabled by default and you can see tasks from the Tekton Hub that are supported by your cluster. Administrators can opt out of the Tekton Hub Integration and the Tekton Hub tasks will no longer be displayed. You can also check whether a webhook URL exists for a generated pipeline. Default webhooks are added for the pipelines that are created using the *+Add* flow and the URL is visible in the side panel of the selected resources in the Topology view.
