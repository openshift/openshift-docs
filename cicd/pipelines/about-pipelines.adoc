toc::[]

{pipelines-title} is a cloud-native, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) solution based on Kubernetes resources. It uses Tekton building blocks to automate deployments across multiple platforms by abstracting away the underlying implementation details. Tekton introduces a number of standard custom resource definitions (CRDs) for defining CI/CD pipelines that are portable across Kubernetes distributions.

[NOTE]
====
Because {pipelines-title} releases on a different cadence from {product-title}, the {pipelines-title} documentation is now available as a separate documentation set at link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_pipelines[Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines].
