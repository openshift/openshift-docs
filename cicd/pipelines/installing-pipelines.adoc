This guide walks cluster administrators through the process of installing the {pipelines-title} Operator to an {product-title} cluster.

// Prerequisites for installing OpenShift Operator
[discrete]
== Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.

* You have installed `oc` CLI.
* You have installed xref:../../cli_reference/tkn_cli/installing-tkn.adoc#installing-tkn[OpenShift Pipelines (`tkn`) CLI] on your local system.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
* Ensure that you have downloaded the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager] as shown in the xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-customizations.adoc#installation-obtaining-installer_installing-gcp-customizations[Obtaining the installation program] to install this Operator.

If you have the pull secret, add the `redhat-operators` catalog to the OperatorHub custom resource (CR) as shown in xref:../../post_installation_configuration/preparing-for-users.adoc#olm-installing-operators-from-operatorhub-configure_post-install-preparing-for-users[Configuring {product-title} to use Red Hat Operators].
