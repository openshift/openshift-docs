toc::[]

Stale `TaskRun` and `PipelineRun` objects and their executed instances occupy physical resources that can be used for the active runs. To prevent this waste, {pipelines-title} provides annotations that cluster administrators can use to automatically prune the unused objects and their instances in various namespaces. 

[NOTE]
====
* Starting with {pipelines-title} 1.6, auto-pruning is enabled by default.
* Configuring automatic pruning by specifying annotations affects the entire namespace. You cannot selectively auto-prune individual task runs and pipeline runs in a namespace.
