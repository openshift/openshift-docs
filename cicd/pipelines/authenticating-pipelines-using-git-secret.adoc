A Git secret consists of credentials to securely interact with a Git repository, and is often used to automate authentication. In {pipelines-title}, you can use Git secrets to authenticate pipeline runs and task runs that interact with a Git repository during execution.

A pipeline run or a task run gains access to the secrets through the associated service account. {pipelines-shortname} support the use of Git secrets as annotations (key-value pairs) for basic authentication and SSH-based authentication.
