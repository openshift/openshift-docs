// Base the file name and the ID on the assembly title. For example:
// * file name: my-assembly-a.adoc
// * ID: [id="my-assembly-a"]
// * Title: = My assembly A

// Choose a context that is not too long and encapsulates what this assembly or
// module is about. Context MUST be unique.

// Not sure if this guide is correct with the current guidelines anymore. Need to validate.
