== New features and enhancements

[id="fips-compatability-rn"]
=== FIPS compatibility

FIPS mode is now automatically enabled for {sandboxed-containers-first}. {sandboxed-containers-first} deployed on an {product-title} cluster installed in FIPS mode will not taint the cluster's FIPS support. For more information, see xref:../sandboxed_containers/understanding-sandboxed-containers.adoc#security-compliance-nist_understanding-sandboxed-containers[Understanding compliance and risk management].

[id="collect-resources-with-must-gather-rn"]
=== Collect resources with must-gather

The {sandboxed-containers-operator} now includes a must-gather image, allowing you to collect custom resources and log files specific to this Operator and the underlying runtime components for diagnostic purposes. For more information, see xref:../sandboxed_containers/troubleshooting-sandboxed-containers.adoc#troubleshooting-sandboxed-containers[Collecting {sandboxed-containers-first} data for Red Hat Support].

[id="sandboxed-containers-disconnected-environments-rn"]
=== Disconnected environments

You can now install the {sandboxed-containers-operator} in a disconnected environment. For more information, see the xref:../sandboxed_containers/deploying-sandboxed-container-workloads.adoc#deploying-sandboxed-containers-workloads_additional-resources[Additional resources for Deploying {sandboxed-containers-first} workloads].

[id="sandboxed-containers-1-1-bug-fixes"]
== Bug fixes

* Previously, when running Fedora on {sandboxed-containers-first}, some packages required file access permission changes that {product-title} did not grant to containers by default. With this release, these permissions are granted by default. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1915377[*BZ#1915377*])

* Previously, adding a value to `kataConfgPoolSelector` in the {product-title} web console populated `scheduling.nodeSelector` with an empty value. As a result, pods that used a `RuntimeClass` object with the value of `kata` could be scheduled to nodes without the Kata Containers runtime installed. With this release, only nodes labeled with the same label as defined in `kataConfgPoolSelector` will install the Kata Containers runtime. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2019384[*BZ#2019384*])

* Previously, the {sandboxed-containers-operator} details page on Operator Hub was missing fields. In this release, these fields are no longer missing. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2019383[*BZ#2019383*])

* Previously, creating multiple `KataConfig` custom resources resulted in a silent failure, with no error from the {product-title} web console notifying the user that creating more than one custom resource failed. With this release, the user receives an error when trying to create multiple custom resources. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2019381[*BZ#2019381*])

* Previously, there were instances where the Operator Hub in the {product-title} web console did not display icons for an Operator. With this release, icons are always displayed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2019380[*BZ#9019380*])

[id="sandboxed-containers-1-1-known-issues"]
== Known issues

* If you are using {sandboxed-containers-first}, you cannot use the `hostPath` volume in a {product-title} cluster to mount a file or directory from the host nodeâ€™s file system into your pod. As an alternative, you can use local persistent volumes. See xref:../storage/persistent_storage/persistent-storage-local.adoc[Persistent storage using local volumes] for more information. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1904609[*BZ#1904609*])
