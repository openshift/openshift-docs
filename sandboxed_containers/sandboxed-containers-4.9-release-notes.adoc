* If you are using {sandboxed-containers-first}, you might receive SELinux denials accessing files or directories mounted from the `hostPath` volume in an {product-title} cluster. These denials can occur even when running privileged sandboxed containers, since privileged sandboxed containers do not disable SELinux checks.
+
Following SELinux policy on the host guarantees full isolation of the host file system from the sandboxed workload by default, and provides stronger protection against potential security flaws in `virtiofsd` or QEMU.
+
If the mounted files or directories do not have specific SELinux requirements on the host, you can use local persistent volumes as an alternative. Files are automatically relabeled to `container_file_t`, following SELinux policy for container runtimes. See xref:../storage/persistent_storage/persistent-storage-local.adoc[Persistent storage using local volumes] for more information.
+
Automatic relabeling is not an option when mounted files or directories are expected to have specific SELinux labels on the host. Instead, you can set custom SELinux rules on the host in order to allow virtiofsd to access these specific labels. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1904609[*BZ#1904609*])
