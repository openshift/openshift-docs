=== {sandboxed-containers-first} support on {product-title} (Technology Preview)

{sandboxed-containers-first} 1.0.0 Technology Preview release introduces built-in support for running Kata Containers as an additional runtime. {sandboxed-containers-first} enables users to choose Kata Containers as an additional runtime to provide additional isolation for their workloads. The {sandboxed-containers-operator} automates the tasks of installing, removing, and updating Kata Containers. It allows for tracking the state of those tasks by describing the `KataConfig` custom resource.

{sandboxed-containers-first} are only supported on bare metal. {op-system-first} is the only supported operating system for {sandboxed-containers-first} 1.0.0. Disconnected environments are not supported in {product-title} {product-version}.

For more information, see xref:../sandboxed_containers/understanding-sandboxed-containers.adoc#understanding-sandboxed-containers[Understanding OpenShift sandboxed containers]

== Known issues

* If you are using {sandboxed-containers-first}, you cannot use the `hostPath` volume in a {product-title} cluster to mount a file or directory from the host node’s file system into your pod. As an alternative, you can use local persistent volumes. See xref:../storage/persistent_storage/persistent-storage-local.adoc[Persistent storage using local volumes] for more information. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1904609[*BZ#1904609*])

* If you are running Fedora on {sandboxed-containers-first}, you need a workaround to install some packages. Some packages, like `iputils`, require file access permission changes that {product-title} does not grant to containers by default. To run containers that require such special permissions, it is necessary to add an annotation to the YAML file describing the workload, which tells `virtiofsd` to accept such file permissions for that workload. The required annotations are:
+
[source,yaml]
----
io.katacontainers.config.hypervisor.virtio_fs_extra_args: |
  [ "-o", "modcaps=+sys_admin", "-o", "xattr" ]
----
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1915377[*BZ#1915377*])

* In the 4.8 release, adding a value to `kataConfgPoolSelector` by using the {product-title} web console causes `scheduling.nodeSelector` to be populated with an empty value. Pods that use `RuntimeClass` with the value of `kata` might be scheduled to nodes that do not have the Kata Containers runtime installed.
+
To work around this issue, specify the `nodeSelector` value manually in the `RuntimeClass` `kata` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit runtimeclass kata
----
+
The following is an example of a `RuntimeClass` with the correct `nodeSelector` statement.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
handler: kata
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2021-06-14T12:54:19Z"
  name: kata
overhead:

    cpu: 250m
    memory: 350Mi

    custom-kata-pool: "true"
----
+
(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2019384[*BZ#2019384*])

* The {sandboxed-containers-operator} details page on Operator Hub contains a few missing fields. The missing fields do not prevent you from installing the {sandboxed-containers-operator} in 4.8. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2019383[*BZ#2019383*])

* Creating multiple `KataConfig` custom resources results in a silent failure. The {product-title} web console does not provide a prompt to notify the user that creating more than one custom resource has failed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2019381[*BZ#2019381*])

* Sometimes the Operator Hub in the {product-title} web console does not display icons for an Operator. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2019380[*BZ#2019380*])
