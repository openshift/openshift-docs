{sandboxed-containers-first} support for {product-title} provides you with built-in support for running Kata Containers as an additional optional runtime. This is particularly useful for performing the following tasks:

- Run privileged or untrusted workloads.
- Ensure kernel isolation for each workload.
- Share the same workload across tenants.
- Ensure proper isolation and sandboxing for testing software.
- Ensure default resource containment through VM boundaries.

{sandboxed-containers-first} also provides the ability to choose from the type of workload that they want to run to cover a wide variety of use cases.

You can use the {sandboxed-containers-operator} to perform tasks such as installation and removal, updates, and status monitoring.
