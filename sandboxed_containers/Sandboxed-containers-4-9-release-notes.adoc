//Get list from Vadim

//examples:
//==== Cloud Compute

//* Previously, when a root volume was created for a new server, and that server was not successfully created, the automatic deletion for the volume was not triggered because there was no deletion of a server associated with the volume. In some situations, this led to the creation of many extra volumes, and caused errors if the volume quota was reached. With this release, newly created root volumes are deleted when server creation call fails.
//(link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1943378[*BZ#1943378*])

//* Previously, when using the default value for `instanceType`, the Machine API created `m4.large` instances on AWS. This is different than the `m5.large` instance type for machines that are created by the {product-title} installer. With this release, the Machine API creates `m5.large` instances for new machines on AWS when the default value is specified.
