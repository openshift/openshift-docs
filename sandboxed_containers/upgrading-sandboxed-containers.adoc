toc::[]

The upgrade of the {sandboxed-containers-first} components consists of the following three steps:

* Upgrading {product-title} to update the `Kata` runtime and its dependencies.

* Upgrading the {sandboxed-containers-operator} to update the Operator subscription.

* Manually patching the `KataConfig` custom resource (CR) to update the monitor pods.

You can upgrade {product-title} before or after the {sandboxed-containers-operator} upgrade, with the one exception noted below. Always apply the `KataConfig` patch immediately after upgrading {sandboxed-containers-operator}.

[IMPORTANT]
====

If you are upgrading to {product-title} 4.11 with {sandboxed-containers-first} 1.3, the recommended order is to first upgrade {sandboxed-containers-first} from 1.2 to 1.3, and then upgrade {product-title} from 4.10 to 4.11.

== Upgrading the {sandboxed-containers-first} resources

The {sandboxed-containers-first} resources are deployed onto the cluster using {op-system-first} extensions.

//Update the Red Hat CoreOS extension with the updated link once PR is approved for the Understanding section.

The {op-system} extension `sandboxed containers` contains the required components to run Kata Containers such as the Kata containers runtime, the hypervisor QEMU, and other dependencies. You upgrade the extension by upgrading the cluster to a new release of {product-title}.

For more information about upgrading {product-title}, see xref:../updating/index.adoc#index[Updating Clusters].

[id="sandboxed-containers-upgrading-operator"]
== Upgrading the {sandboxed-containers-operator}

Use Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to upgrade the {sandboxed-containers-operator} either manually or automatically. Selecting between manual or automatic upgrade during the initial deployment determines the future upgrade mode. For manual upgrades, the web console shows the available updates that can be installed by the cluster administrator.

For more information about upgrading the {sandboxed-containers-operator} in Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), see xref:../operators/admin/olm-upgrading-operators.adoc#olm-upgrading-operators[Updating installed Operators].

[id="sandboxed-containers-upgrading-monitor-pods"]
== Upgrading the {sandboxed-containers-first} monitor pods

After upgrading {sandboxed-containers-first}, you need to update the monitor image in the `KataConfig` CR to upgrade the monitor pods. Otherwise, the monitor pods will continue running images from the previous version.

You can perform the update using the web console or the CLI.
