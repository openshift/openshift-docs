== Recognizing resource and project limits and quotas

You can view a graphical representation of available resources in the *Topology* view of the web console *Developer* perspective.

If a resource has a message about resource limitations or quotas being reached, a yellow border appears around the resource name. Click the resource to open a side panel to see the message. If the *Topology* view has been zoomed out, a yellow dot indicates that a message is available.

If using *List View* from the *View Shortcuts* menu, resources appear as a list. The *Alerts* column indicates if a message is available.
