The {product-title} web console provides two perspectives; the *Administrator* perspective and the *Developer* perspective.

The *Developer* perspective provides workflows specific to developer use cases, such as the ability to:

* Create and deploy applications on {product-title} by importing existing codebases, images, and dockerfiles.
* Visually interact with applications, components, and services associated with them within a project and monitor their deployment and build status.
* Group components within an application and connect the components within and across applications.
* Integrate serverless capabilities (Technology Preview).
* Create workspaces to edit your application code using Eclipse Che.

.Prerequisites

To access the *Developer* perspective, ensure that you have logged in to the web console.
