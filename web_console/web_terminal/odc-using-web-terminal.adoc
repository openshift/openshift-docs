You can launch an embedded command line terminal instance in the web console. This terminal instance is preinstalled with common CLI tools for interacting with the cluster, such as `oc`, `kubectl`,`odo`, `kn`, `tkn`, `helm`, and `subctl`. It also has the context of the project you are working on and automatically logs you in using your credentials.
