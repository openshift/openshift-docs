As a cluster administrator, you can install an embedded command line terminal instance in the web console.
This terminal instance is preinstalled with common CLI tools for interacting with the cluster, such as `oc`, `kubectl`,`odo`, `kn`, `tkn`, `helm`, `kubens`, `subctl`, and `kubectx`. It also has the context of the project you are working on, and automatically logs you in using your credentials.
