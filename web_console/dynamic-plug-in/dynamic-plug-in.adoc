== General guidelines
When creating your plug-in, follow these general guidelines:

* link:https://nodejs.org/en/[`Node.js`] and link:https://yarnpkg.com/[`yarn`] are required to build and run your plug-in. 
* Prefix your CSS class names with your plug-in name to avoid collisions. For example, `my-plugin_\_heading` and `my-plugin_\_icon`.
* Maintain a consistent look, feel, and behavior with other console pages.
* Follow link:https://www.i18next.com/[react-i18next] localization guidelines when creating your plug-in. You can use the `useTranslation` hook like the one in the following example:
+
[source,ymal]
----
conster Header: React.FC = () => {
  const { t } = useTranslation('plugin__console-demo-plugin');
  return <h1>{t('Hello, World!')}</h1>;
};
----

* Avoid selectors that could affect markup outside of your plug-ins components, such as element selectors. These are not APIs and are subject to change. Using them might break your plug-in. Avoid selectors like element selectors that could affect markup outside of your plug-ins components.

== PatternFly 4 guidelines
When creating your plug-in, follow these guidelines for using PatternFly:

* Use link:https://www.patternfly.org/v4/[PatternFly4] components and PatternFly CSS variables. Core PatternFly components are available through the SDK. Using PatternFly components and variables help your plug-in look consistent in future console versions.
* Make your plug-in accessible by following link:https://www.patternfly.org/v4/accessibility/accessibility-fundamentals/[PatternFly's accessibility fundamentals].
* Avoid using other CSS libraries such as Bootstrap or Tailwind. They can conflict with PatternFly and will not match the console look and feel.
