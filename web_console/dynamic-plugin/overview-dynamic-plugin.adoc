== General guidelines
When creating your plugin, follow these general guidelines:

* link:https://nodejs.org/en/[`Node.js`] and link:https://yarnpkg.com/[`yarn`] are required to build and run your plugin.
* Prefix your CSS class names with your plugin name to avoid collisions. For example, `my-plugin_\_heading` and `my-plugin_\_icon`.
* Maintain a consistent look, feel, and behavior with other console pages.
* Follow link:https://www.i18next.com/[react-i18next] localization guidelines when creating your plugin. You can use the `useTranslation` hook like the one in the following example:
+
[source,ymal]
----
conster Header: React.FC = () => {
  const { t } = useTranslation('plugin__console-demo-plugin');
  return <h1>{t('Hello, World!')}</h1>;
};
----

* Avoid selectors that could affect markup outside of your plugins components, such as element selectors. These are not APIs and are subject to change. Using them might break your plugin. Avoid selectors like element selectors that could affect markup outside of your plugins components.

== PatternFly guidelines
When creating your plugin, follow these guidelines for using PatternFly:

* Use link:https://www.patternfly.org/components/all-components/[PatternFly] components and PatternFly CSS variables. Core PatternFly components are available through the SDK. Using PatternFly components and variables help your plugin look consistent in future console versions.
* Make your plugin accessible by following link:https://www.patternfly.org/accessibility/accessibility-fundamentals/[PatternFly's accessibility fundamentals].
* Avoid using other CSS libraries such as Bootstrap or Tailwind. They can conflict with PatternFly and will not match the console look and feel.
