toc::[]

The {product-title} web console provides two perspectives; the *Administrator* perspective and the *Developer* perspective.

[NOTE]
====
The default web console perspective that is shown depends on the role of the user. The *Administrator* perspective is displayed by default if the user is recognized as an administrator.
====

The *Administrator* perspective provides workflows specific to administrator use cases, such as the ability to:

* Manage workload storage, networking, and cluster settings.
* Add users and groups with different levels of permissions to use or modify clusters.
* View and manage a variety of advanced settings such as cluster updates, partial cluster updates, cluster Operators, custom resource definitions (CRDs), role bindings, and resource quotas.
* Access and manage monitoring features such as metrics, alerts, and monitoring dashboards.
* Visually interact with applications, components, and services associated with *Administrator* perspective in the OpenShift platform.
