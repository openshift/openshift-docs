== Overview
All OpenShift applications must belong to a _domain_, which forms part of an application's public URL. The format for an application URL is _application-domain_.example.com. Each account can have access to one or more domains that are shared by others. Depending on the type of account you have, you might be able to create more than one domain.

ifdef::openshift-online[]
A blacklist restricts the domain names that are available. A warning message informs you if a blacklisted domain name has been selected when you attempt to create a domain. Domain names consist of a maximum of 16 alphanumeric characters and cannot contain spaces or symbols. Note that a domain must be created before you can create applications.

If you created a domain when you initially link:../client_tools_install_guide/configuring_client_tools.html[configured] the client tools, you can begin creating applications. Otherwise, you can create a new domain by running the interactive setup wizard with the `rhc setup` command, or you can create a domain with the `rhc domain create` command.

//== Renaming a Domain
//When you rename a domain, the old domain is deleted and a new one is created. Therefore, all applications that exist under a domain must be deleted before you can rename a domain.

//[WARNING]
//====
//Deleting an application deletes all remote application data. This operation cannot be reversed and the data cannot be recovered.
//====

//Follow these steps to rename a domain:

//.  Ensure that the domain does not contain any applications:
//+
//----
//rhc apps
//----

//.  Delete all applications that exist in that domain, if necessary:
//+
//----
//rhc app delete <app_name>
//----

//.  Rename the domain:
//+
//----
//rhc domain rename <old_domain> <new_domain>

== Tutorial: Creating and Managing Domains
The following tutorial shows you how to create, rename, and delete domains.

*To create a domain*

rhc domain create mydomain

*To rename a domain*

When renaming a domain, you must first ensure that no applications exist in the domain you want to rename. If there are applications in that domain, you must first delete all applications before you can rename the domain.

. Determine if there are applications in the domain:
+
----
$ rhc apps
----

. Delete each application that exists in that domain:
+
----
$ rhc delete myapp
----
+
[WARNING]
====
You must first delete all applications from the domain before you can rename it. Understand that deleting an application deletes all remote data associated with that application, which cannot be recovered.
====

. With all applications deleted from that domain, rename the domain:
+
----
$ rhc domain rename myolddomain mynewdomain
----

*To delete a domain*

Deleting a domain is similar to renaming it, where all applications that exist in that domain must first be deleted. When all applications from the domain have been deleted, you can then delete the domain:

----
$ rhc domain delete mydomain
----
