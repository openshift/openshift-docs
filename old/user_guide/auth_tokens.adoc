== Overview
An authorization token is used to automatically log in to an OpenShift account without having to enter login credentials each time. A token is also used to grant another user full or partial access to an account, which is determined by the _scope_ of the token, which are described in the following table.

.Available Scopes for Authorization Tokens

|===

|session |Access to all API functions against an account |1 day
|read |Read-only access to account resources, but cannot view authorization tokens |1 month
|userinfo |Access to login name, unique id, and user capabilities |1 month
|===

When the client tools are installed and the `rhc setup` command is initially run to link:../client_tools_install_guide/configuring_client_tools.html[configure] the client tools, the setup wizard prompts you to create an authorization token. If you answer [userinput]#YES#, the wizard creates a session token in the [filename]#~/.openshift# directory. With this token, all client tool commands can be run without entering login credentials each time. When the token expires you are automatically prompted to reenter login information to renew the existing token.

If an authorization token was not created when the client tools were installed, you can run the setup wizard again with the `rhc setup` command to create one.

When you attempt to run an `rhc` command for the first time or after an authorization token has expired, you are prompted to enter your password. Entering your password generates a _session_ token automatically and the command executes as normal.

If an existing authorization token is no longer required and you do not want to be prompted for token renewal, run the `rhc logout` command to delete the token.

//== Examples
//In the following example we attempt to create an application without having an authorization token. When the command is run, you are prompted to enter a password.

//.Example Without Authorization Token
//====

//----
//$ rhc app create myapp php-5.3
//Your authorization token has expired. Please sign in now to continue on
//openshift.redhat.com.
//Password:
//----

//In this case when you enter your password an authorization token is created and the command proceeds to create the specified application. All subsequent commands are run //without requiring your password.
