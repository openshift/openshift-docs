Most errors occur during Collector startup when Collector configures itself and loads eBPF probe into the system.

Collector startup process involves the following stages:

* Parse Configuration
* Analyze Host
* Connecting to Sensor
* Loading eBPF probe

Failure at any step is considered fatal. If any part of the startup
procedure fails, the logs display a diagnostic summary with details about which steps
succeeded or failed.

The following log file example shows a successful startup:

[source,terminal]
----
[INFO    2025/07/24 10:05:54] == Collector Startup Diagnostics: ==
[INFO    2025/07/24 10:05:54]  Connected to Sensor?       false
[INFO    2025/07/24 10:05:54]  Kernel driver candidates:
[INFO    2025/07/24 10:05:54]    core_bpf (available)
[INFO    2025/07/24 10:05:54]  Driver loaded into kernel: core_bpf
[INFO    2025/07/24 10:05:54] ====================================
----
The log output confirms that Collector connected to Sensor and loaded the eBPF probe.
You can use this log to check for the successful startup of Collector.
