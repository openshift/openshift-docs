If you created the key pair on a {op-system-base-full} system, before you can use the public key on a Windows system, make sure the public key is saved using ASCII encoding. For example, the following PowerShell command copies a public key, encoding it for the ASCII character set:

[source,terminal]
----
C:\> echo "ssh-rsa <ssh_pub_key>" | Out-File <ssh_key_path> -Encoding ascii
----

where:

`<ssh_pub_key>`:: Specifies the SSH public key used to access the cluster.
`<ssh_key_path>`:: Specifies the path to the SSH public key.
