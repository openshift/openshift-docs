[NOTE]
====
As of logging version 5.6 Fluentd is deprecated and is planned to be removed in a future release. Red Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this feature during the current release lifecycle, but this feature will no longer receive enhancements and will be removed. As an alternative to Fluentd, you can use Vector instead.
