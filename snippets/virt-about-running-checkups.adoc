Running a predefined checkup in an existing namespace involves setting up a service account for the checkup, creating the `Role` and `RoleBinding` objects for the service account, enabling permissions for the checkup, and creating the input config map and the checkup job. You can run a checkup multiple times.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must always:

* Verify that the checkup image is from a trustworthy source before applying it.
* Review the checkup permissions before creating the `Role` and `RoleBinding` objects.
