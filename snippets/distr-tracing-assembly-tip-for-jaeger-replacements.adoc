[WARNING]

[subs="attributes+"]
The {JaegerName} 3.5 is the last release of the {JaegerName} that Red Hat plans to support.

In the {DTProductName} 3.5, Jaeger and support for Elasticsearch remain deprecated.

Support for the {JaegerName} ends on November 3, 2025.

The {JaegerOperator} Operator (Jaeger) will be removed from the `redhat-operators` catalog on November 3, 2025. For more information, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase solution link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7083722[Jaeger Deprecation and Removal in OpenShift].

You must migrate to the {OTELName} Operator and the {TempoOperator} for distributed tracing collection and storage. For more information, see "Migrating" in the {OTELShortName} documentation, "Installing" in the {OTELName} documentation, and "Installing" in the {TempoShortName} documentation.
