You should only modify the {op-system} image for compute machines to use {platform-abbreviation} Marketplace image. Control plane machines and infrastructure nodes do not require an {product-title} subscription and use the public RHCOS default image by default, which does not incur subscription costs on your {platform-abbreviation-short} bill. Therefore, you should not modify the cluster default boot image or the control plane boot images. Applying the {platform-abbreviation-short} Marketplace image to them will incur additional licensing costs that cannot be recovered.
