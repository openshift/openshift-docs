== SPO auto select of selinuxd image

SPO now auto selects the appropriate selinuxd image based on mapping in
the security-profiles-operator-profile. If none of the entries match, SPO
falls back to the image provided by RELATED_IMAGE_SELINUXD.

This feature allows SPO to support cluster nodes regardless of whether the nodes are running RHCOS based on RHEL-8 or RHEL-9

[NOTE]
====
The image selection is transparent and happens by default. However,
since the operator manifests now include two versions of selinuxd, one for RHEL-9 based RHCOS and one for RHEL-8 based RHCOS, users who mirror images for disconnected installs must take care to mirror both selinuxd images.
