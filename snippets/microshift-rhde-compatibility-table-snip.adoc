.{op-system-bundle} release compatibility matrix

{op-system-base-full} and {microshift-short} work together as a single solution for device-edge computing. You can update each component separately, but the product versions must be compatible. For example, an update of {microshift-short} from 4.14 to 4.16 requires a {op-system} update. Supported configurations of {op-system-bundle} use verified releases for each together as listed in the following table:
