  # Injector and OperatorWebhook pods can be disabled (set to "false") below
  # to reduce the number of management pods. It is recommended to start with the 
  # webhook and injector pods enabled, and only disable them after verifying the
  # correctness of user manifests.
  #   If the injector is disabled, containers using sr-iov resources must explicitly assign
  #   them in the  "requests"/"limits" section of the container spec, for example:
  #    containers:
  #    - name: my-sriov-workload-container
  #      resources:
  #        limits:
  #          openshift.io/<resource_name>:  "1"
  #        requests:
  #          openshift.io/<resource_name>:  "1"
