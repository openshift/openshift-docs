<1> Shows the `ClusterVersion` CR to trigger the update. The `channel`, `upstream`, and `desiredVersion` fields are all required for image pre-caching.
<2> `ImageSignature.yaml` contains the image signature of the required release image. The image signature is used to verify the image before applying the platform update.
<3> Shows the mirror repository that contains the required {product-title} image. Get the mirrors from the `imageDigestSources.yaml` file that you saved when following the procedures in the "Setting up the environment" section.
