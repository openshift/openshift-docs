[NOTE]
====
To ensure your {oadp-short} installation is successful, it is important to understand a few key dependencies. Starting from {oadp-short} 1.0.4, you can use {oadp-short} 1.0.z versions as a dependency of the {mtc-first} Operator, but they are not available as a standalone Operator. Additionally, if you are working in a restricted network environment, you will need to disable the default OperatorHub sources and mirror the Operator catalog before proceeding with your installation.
