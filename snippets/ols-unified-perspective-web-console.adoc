====
Starting with {ocp-product-title} 4.19, the perspectives in the web console are unified. The *Developer* perspective is no longer enabled by default.

All users can interact with all {ocp-product-title} web console features. However, if you are not the cluster owner, you might need to request permission to certain features from the cluster owner.

You can still enable the *Developer* perspective. On the *Getting Started* pane in the web console, you can take a tour of the console, find information on setting up your cluster, view a quick start for enabling the *Developer* perspective, and follow links to explore new features and capabilities.
