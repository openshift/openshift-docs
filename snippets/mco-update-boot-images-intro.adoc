For {gcp-first} and {aws-first} clusters, by default the Machine Config Operator (MCO) manages and updates the boot image that is used to scale up your nodes. This means that by default, the MCO updates the boot images whenever you upgrade your cluster.

For all other platforms, the MCO does not update the boot image with each cluster update.
