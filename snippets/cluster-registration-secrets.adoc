Cluster registration secrets (CRSes) offer improved security and are easier to use. CRSes contain a single token that can be used when installing {product-title-short} by using both Operator and Helm installation methods.

CRSes provide better security because they are only used for registering a new secured cluster. If leaked, the certificates and keys in an init bundle can be used to impersonate services running on a secured cluster. By contrast, the certificate and key in a CRS can only be used for _registering_ a new cluster.

After the cluster is set up by using the CRS, service-specific certificates are issued by Central and sent to the new secured cluster. These service certificates are used for communication between Central and secured clusters. Therefore, a CRS can be revoked after the cluster is registered without disconnecting secured clusters.
