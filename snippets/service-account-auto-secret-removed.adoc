== About automatically-generated service account token secrets

In {product-version}, {product-title} is adopting an link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md#urgent-upgrade-notes-1[enhancement from upstream Kubernetes], which enables the `LegacyServiceAccountTokenNoAutoGeneration` feature by default. As a result, when creating new service accounts (SA), a service account token secret is no longer automatically generated. Previously, {product-title} automatically added a service account token to a secret for each new SA. 

However, some features and workloads need service account token secrets to communicate with the Kubernetes API server, for example, the OpenShift Controller Manager. While this requirement will be changed in a future release, it remains in {product-title} {product-version}. As a result, if you need a service account token secret, you must manually use the TokenRequest API to request bound service account tokens or create a service account token secret.

After upgrading to {product-version}, existing service account token secrets are not deleted and continue to function as expected.

[NOTE]
====
In {product-version}, service account token secrets are still automatically generated. Instead of creating two secrets per service account, {product-title} now only creates one. In a future release, the number will be further reduced to zero. Note that `dockercfg` secrets are still generated and no secrets are deleted during upgrades.
