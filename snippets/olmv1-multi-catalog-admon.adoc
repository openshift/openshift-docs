[IMPORTANT]
====
If you try to install an Operator or extension that does not have unique name, the installation might fail or lead to an unpredictable result. This occurs for the following reasons:

* If mulitple catalogs are installed on a cluster, {olmv1} does not include a mechanism to specify a catalog when you install an Operator or extension.
* Dependency resolution in {olmv1-first} requires that all of the Operators and extensions that are available to install on a cluster use a unique name for their bundles and packages.
