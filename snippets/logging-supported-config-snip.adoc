The supported way of configuring the logging subsystem for Red Hat OpenShift is by configuring it using the options described in this documentation. Do not use other configurations, as they are unsupported. Configuration paradigms might change across OpenShift Container Platform releases, and such cases can only be handled gracefully if all configuration possibilities are controlled. If you use configurations other than those described in this documentation, your changes will disappear because the Operators reconcile any differences. The Operators reverse everything to the defined state by default and by design.

[NOTE]
====
If you must perform configurations not described in the OpenShift Container Platform documentation, you must set your Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator to `Unmanaged`. An unmanaged OpenShift Logging environment is not supported and does not receive updates until you return OpenShift Logging to `Managed`.
