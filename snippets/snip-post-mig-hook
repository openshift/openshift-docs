[NOTE]
====
Post-migration hooks are not likely to work well with the OADP 1.3 Data Mover.

The OADP 1.1 and OADP 1.2 Data Movers use synchronous processes to back up and restore application data. Because the processes are synchronous, users can be sure that any post-restore hooks start only after the persistent volumes (PVs) of the related pods are released by the persistent volume claim (PVC) of the Data Mover.

However, the OADP 1.3 Data Mover uses an asynchronous process. As a result of this difference in sequencing, a post-restore hook might be called before the related PVs were released by the PVC of the Data Mover. If this happens, the pod remains in `Pending` status and cannot run the hook. The hook attempt might time out before the pod is released, leading to a `PartiallyFailed` restore operation.
