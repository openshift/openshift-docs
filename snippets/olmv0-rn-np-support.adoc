In {product-title} {product-version}.{olm-np-z-stream}, Operator Lifecycle Manage (OLM) allows Operators to include network policy manifests in their resource bundles. These tailored network policies protect against data leaks and harden against many attack vectors on {product-title} clusters.

[TIP]
====
If your current version of OLM does not support tailored network policies, a
notification is displayed in the following locations:

* The {hybrid-console}
* The web console of the affected cluster

Update to {product-title} {product-version}.{olm-np-z-stream} or later to
enable OLM support for tailored network policies.

For more information, including the planned timeline for releasing Red{nbsp}Hat-provided Operators with tailored network policies, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7133113[Operators shipping with network policies may require OCP cluster upgrade before they can be upgraded (Red Hat Knowledgebase)].
