In {product-title} {product-version}.{olm-np-z-stream}, {olmv0-first} supports the inclusion of network policy manifests in the resource bundles of Operators. These tailored network policies protect against data leaks and harden against many attack vectors on {product-title} clusters.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you try to update or install an Operator that includes a tailored network policy and your OLM version does not support network policies, you receive a notification. An insights rule in the CLI or web console alerts you to update to  {product-title} {product-version}.{olm-np-z-stream} or later.
