Knative services are automatically assigned a default domain name based on your cluster configuration. For example, `<service_name>-<namespace>.example.com`. You can customize the domain for your Knative service by mapping a custom domain name that you own to a Knative service.

You can do this by creating a `DomainMapping` resource for the service. You can also create multiple `DomainMapping` resources to map multiple domains and subdomains to a single service.
