<1> Clusters to upgrade.
<2> Target platform version, the seed image to be used, and the secret required to access the image.

[NOTE]
====
If you add the seed image pull secret in the hub cluster, in the same namespace as the `ImageBasedGroupUpgrade` resource, the secret is added to the manifest list for the `Prep` stage. The secret is recreated in each spoke cluster in the `openshift-lifecycle-agent` namespace.
====
+
<3> Optional: Applies additional manifests, which are not in the seed image, to the target cluster. Also applies `ConfigMap` objects for custom catalog sources.
<4> `ConfigMap` resources that contain the OADP `Backup` and `Restore` CRs.
<5> Upgrade plan details.
<6> Number of clusters to update in a batch.
<7> Timeout limit to complete the action in minutes.
