Using `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs to manage and deploy polices to managed clusters will be deprecated in an upcoming {product-title} release.
Equivalent and improved functionality is available using {rh-rhacm-first} and `PolicyGenerator` CRs.

For more information about `PolicyGenerator` resources, see the {rh-rhacm} link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/{rh-rhacm-version}/html/governance/integrate-third-party-policy-controllers#policy-generator[Policy Generator] documentation.
