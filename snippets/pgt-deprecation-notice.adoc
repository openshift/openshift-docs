Using `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs to manage and deploy policies to managed clusters will be deprecated in an upcoming {product-title} release.
Equivalent and improved functionality is available using {rh-rhacm-first} and `PolicyGenerator` CRs.

For more information about `PolicyGenerator` resources, see the {rh-rhacm} link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/{rh-rhacm-version}/html-single/governance/index#integrate-policy-generator[Integrating Policy Generator] documentation.
