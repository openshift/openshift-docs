Currently, {olmv1-first} cannot authenticate private registries, such as the Red{nbsp}Hat-provided Operator catalogs. This is a known issue. As a result, the {olmv1} procedures that rely on having the Red{nbsp}Hat Operators catalog installed do not work. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-36364[*OCPBUGS-36364*])
