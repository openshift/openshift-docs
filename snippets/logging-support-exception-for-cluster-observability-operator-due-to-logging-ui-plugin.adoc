[IMPORTANT]
====
Until the approaching General Availability (GA) release of the Cluster Observability Operator (COO), which is currently in link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview] (TP), Red{nbsp}Hat provides support to customers who are using Logging 6.0 or later with the COO for its xref:../../../observability/cluster_observability_operator/ui_plugins/logging-ui-plugin.adoc#logging-ui-plugin[Logging UI Plugin] on {product-title} 4.14 or later. This support exception is temporary as the COO includes several independent features, some of which are still TP features, but the Logging UI Plugin is ready for GA.
