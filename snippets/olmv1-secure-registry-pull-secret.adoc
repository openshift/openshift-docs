If you want to use a catalog that is hosted on a private registry, such as Red{nbsp}Hat-provided Operator catalogs from `registry.redhat.io`, you must have a pull secret scoped to the `openshift-catalogd` namespace.

ifndef::olmv1-pullsecret-proc[For more information, see "Creating a pull secret for catalogs hosted on a secure registry".]

ifdef::olmv1-pullsecret-proc[]
Catalogd cannot read global pull secrets from {product-title} clusters. Catalogd can read references to secrets only in the namespace where it is deployed.
endif::[]
