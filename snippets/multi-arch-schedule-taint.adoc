Tainting each node for a specific architecture:: You can taint a node to avoid the node scheduling workloads that are incompatible with its architecture. When your cluster uses a `MachineSet` object, you can add parameters to the `.spec.template.spec.taints` field to avoid workloads being scheduled on nodes with non-supported architectures.
+
Before you add a taint to a node, you must scale down the `MachineSet` object or remove existing available machines. For more information, see _Modifying a compute machine set_.
