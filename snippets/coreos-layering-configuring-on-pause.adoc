Making certain changes to a `MachineOSConfig` object triggers an automatic rebuild of the associated custom layered image. You can mitigate the effects of the rebuild by pausing the machine config pool where the custom layered image is applied as described in "Pausing the machine config pools." While the pools are paused, the MCO does not roll out the newly built image to the nodes after the build is complete. However, the build will still run regardless of whether the pool is paused or not. For example, if you want to remove and replace a `MachineOSCOnfig` object, pausing the machine config pools before making the change prevents the MCO from reverting the associated nodes to the base image, reducing the number of reboots needed. 

When a machine config pool is paused, the `oc get machineconfigpools` reports the following status:

<1> The `worker` machine config pool is paused, as indicated by the three `False` statuses and the `READYMACHINECOUNT` at `0`.

After the changes have been rolled out, you can unpause the machine config pool.
