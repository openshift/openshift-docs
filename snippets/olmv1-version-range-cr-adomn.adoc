[NOTE]
====
If you specify a channel or define a version range in your Operator or extension's CR, {olmv1} does not display the resolved version installed on the cluster. Only the version and channel information specified in the CR are displayed.

If you want to find the specific version that is installed, you must compare the SHA of the image of the `spec.source.image.ref` field to the image reference in the catalog.
