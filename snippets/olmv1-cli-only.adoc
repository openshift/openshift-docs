====
For {product-title} {product-version}, documented procedures for {olmv1} are CLI-based only. Alternatively, administrators can create and view related objects in the web console by using normal methods, such as the *Import YAML* and *Search* pages. However, the existing *OperatorHub* and *Installed Operators* pages do not yet display {olmv1} components.
