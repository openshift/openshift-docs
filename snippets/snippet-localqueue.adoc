A local queue is a namespaced object, represented by a `LocalQueue` object, that groups closely related workloads that belong to a single namespace.

As an administrator, you can configure a `LocalQueue` object to point to a cluster queue. This allocates resources from the cluster queue to workloads in the namespace specified in the `LocalQueue` object.
