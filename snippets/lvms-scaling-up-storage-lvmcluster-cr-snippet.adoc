<1> Contains the configuration to specify the paths to the devices that you want to add to the LVM volume group.
You can specify the device paths in the `paths` field, the `optionalPaths` field, or both. If you do not specify the device paths in both `paths` and `optionalPaths`, {lvms-first} adds the supported unused devices to the LVM volume group. {lvms} adds the devices to the LVM volume group only if the following conditions are met:
* The device path exists.
* The device is supported by {lvms}. For information about unsupported devices, see "Devices not supported by {lvms}".
<2> Specify the device paths. If the device path specified in this field does not exist, or the device is not supported by {lvms}, the `LVMCluster` CR moves to the `Failed` state.
<3> Specify the optional device paths. If the device path specified in this field does not exist, or the device is not supported by {lvms}, {lvms} ignores the device without causing an error.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After a device is added to the LVM volume group, it cannot be removed.
