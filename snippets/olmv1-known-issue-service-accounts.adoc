There is a known issue in {olmv1}. If you do not assign the correct role-based access controls (RBAC) to an extension's service account, {olmv1} gets stuck and reconciliation stops.

Currently, {olmv1} does not have tools to help extension administrators find the correct RBAC for a service account.

Because {olmv1} is a Technology Preview feature and must not be used on production clusters, you can avoid this issue by using the more permissive RBAC included in the documentation.

This RBAC is intended for testing purposes only. Do not use it on production clusters.
