When you make any of these changes, the node disruption policy determines which of the following actions are required when the MCO implements the changes: 

* *Reboot*: The MCO drains and reboots the nodes. This is the default behavior.
* *None*: The MCO does not drain or reboot the nodes. The MCO applies the changes with no further action. 
* *Drain*: The MCO cordons and drains the nodes of their workloads. The workloads restart with the new configurations.
* *Reload*: For services, the MCO reloads the specified services without restarting the service.
* *Restart*: For services, the MCO fully restarts the specified services.
* *DaemonReload*: The MCO reloads the systemd manager configuration.
* *Special*: This is an internal MCO-only action and cannot be set by the user.

[NOTE]
====
* The `Reboot` and `None` actions cannot be used with with any other actions, as the `Reboot` and `None` actions override the others. 
* Actions are applied in the order that they are set in the node disruption policy list. 
* If you make other machine config changes that do require a reboot or other disruption to the nodes, that reboot supercedes the node disruption policy actions.
