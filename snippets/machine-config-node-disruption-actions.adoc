When you make any of these changes, the node disruption policy determines which of the following actions are required when the MCO implements the changes:

* *Reboot*: The MCO drains and reboots the nodes. This is the default behavior.
* *None*: The MCO does not drain or reboot the nodes. The MCO applies the changes with no further action.
* *Drain*: The MCO cordons and drains the nodes of their workloads. The workloads restart with the new configurations.
* *Reload*: For services, the MCO reloads the specified services without restarting the service.
* *Restart*: For services, the MCO fully restarts the specified services.
* *DaemonReload*: The MCO reloads the systemd manager configuration.
* *Special*: This is an internal MCO-only action that is set by default for changes to the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` file. When this action is set, the MCO determines if a node cordon and drain is required, based on the changed content in the `registries.conf` file. You can override this default. However, it is not recommended to override this setting. You cannot set this action for another path or service.

[NOTE]
====
* The `Reboot` and `None` actions cannot be used with any other actions, as the `Reboot` and `None` actions override the others. 
* Actions are applied in the order that they are set in the node disruption policy list.
* If you make other machine config changes that do require a reboot or other disruption to the nodes, that reboot supercedes the node disruption policy actions.
