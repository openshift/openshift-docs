<1> The index image URL contains the desired Operator images. If the index images are always pushed to the same image name and tag, this change is not needed.
<2> Set how frequently the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) polls the index image for new Operator versions with the `registryPoll.interval` field. This change is not needed if a new index image tag is always pushed for y-stream and z-stream Operator updates. The `registryPoll.interval` field can be set to a shorter interval to expedite the update, however shorter intervals increase computational load. To counteract this behavior, you can restore `registryPoll.interval` to the default value once the update is complete.
<3> Last observed state of the catalog connection. The `READY` value ensures that the `CatalogSource` policy is ready, indicating that the index pod is pulled and is running. This way, {cgu-operator} upgrades the Operators based on up-to-date policy compliance states.
