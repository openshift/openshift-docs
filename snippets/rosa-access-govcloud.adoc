To access {product-title} in AWS GovCloud, you must meet the following requirements:

* {product-title} FedRAMP can only be deployed into an existing VPC. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ROSA/latest/userguide/getting-started-private-link.html#getting-started-private-link-step-2[Create Amazon VPC architecture for the AWS PrivateLink] use case for instructions on setting up a VPC.
* {product-title} in AWS GovCloud only supports the use of the link:https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/what-is-aws-sts-and-how-does-red-hat-openshift-service-on-aws-rosa-use-sts[AWS STS] credentials method.
* {product-title} in AWS GovCloud only uses FIPS validated modules in process cryptographic libraries.
* {product-title} in AWS GovCloud requires a separate Red{nbsp}Hat account for use with FedRAMP, even if you already have an existing Red{nbsp}Hat account for {product-title} clusters in commercial regions.
** Each person who needs to be able to create, modify, or delete clusters must have their own Red{nbsp}Hat FedRAMP account.
** Access to an existing cluster, to use that cluster, does not require a Red{nbsp}Hat FedRAMP account.
* The relationship is:
** One person per VPN account.
** One VPN account is tied to one device.
*** This means you cannot use your VPN credentials on a different device even if you have your hardware token.
** You can use your Red{nbsp}Hat FedRAMP account to deploy to multiple AWS GovCloud accounts.
* Once the access steps have been completed the rest of the documentation applies, although only the {rosa-cli} is available for now.
