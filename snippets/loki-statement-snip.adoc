Loki is a horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant log aggregation system offered as a GA log store for {logging} {for} that can be visualized with the OpenShift {ObservabilityShortName} UI. The Loki configuration provided by OpenShift {logging-uc} is a short-term log store designed to enable users to perform fast troubleshooting with the collected logs. For that purpose, the {logging} {for} configuration of Loki has short-term storage, and is optimized for very recent queries.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For long-term storage or queries over a long time period, users should look to log stores external to their cluster. Loki sizing is only tested and supported for short term storage, for a maximum of 30 days.
