====
As of {product-title} 4.14, `DeploymentConfig` objects are deprecated. `DeploymentConfig` objects are still supported, but are not recommended for new installations. Only security-related and critical issues will be fixed.

Instead, use `Deployment` objects or another alternative to provide declarative updates for pods.
