[NOTE]
====
The {es-op} is deprecated and is planned to be removed in a future release. Red{nbsp}Hat provides bug fixes and support for this feature during the current release lifecycle, but this feature no longer receives enhancements. As an alternative to using the {es-op} to manage the default log storage, you can use the {loki-op}.
