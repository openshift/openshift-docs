[NOTE]
====
 As of logging version 5.4.3 the Elasticsearch Operator is deprecated and is planned to be removed in a future release. Red Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this feature during the current release lifecycle, but this feature will no longer receive enhancements and will be removed. As an alternative to using the Elasticsearch Operator to manage the default log storage, you can use the Loki Operator.
