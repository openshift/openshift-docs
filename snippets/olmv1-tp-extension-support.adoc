Currently, {olmv1-first} supports installing cluster extensions that meet all of the following criteria:

* The extension must use the `registry+v1` bundle format introduced in {olmv0}.
* The extension must support installation via the `AllNamespaces` install mode.
** You can use the `SingleNamespace` and `OwnNamespace` install modes as a Technology Preview feature in {product-title} {product-version} .
* The extension must not declare dependencies by using any of the following file-based catalog properties:
** `olm.gvk.required`
** `olm.package.required`
** `olm.constraint`

{olmv1} checks that the extension meets these constraints. If the extension does not meet these constraints, {olmv1} reports an error message in the cluster extension conditions.
