====
Currently, {olmv1} supports the installation of extensions that meet the following criteria:

* The extension must use the `AllNamespaces` install mode.
* The extension must not use webhooks.

Cluster extensions that use webhooks or that target a single or specified set of namespaces cannot be installed.
