Currently, {olmv1-first} supports installing cluster extensions that meet all of the following criteria:

* The extension must use the `registry+v1` bundle format introduced in {olmv0}.
* The extension must support installation via the `AllNamespaces` install mode.
* The extension must not use webhooks.
* The extension must not declare dependencies by using any of the following file-based catalog properties:

** `olm.gvk.required`
** `olm.package.required`
** `olm.constraint`

{olmv1} checks that the extension you want to install meets these constraints. If the extension that you want to install does not meet these constraints, an error message is printed in the cluster extension's conditions.
