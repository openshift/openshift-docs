In a {logging} deployment, container and infrastructure logs are forwarded to the internal log store defined in the `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR) by default.

Audit logs are not forwarded to the internal log store by default because this does not provide secure storage. You are responsible for ensuring that the system to which you forward audit logs is compliant with your organizational and governmental regulations, and is properly secured.

If this default configuration meets your needs, you do not need to configure a `ClusterLogForwarder` CR. If a `ClusterLogForwarder` CR exists, logs are not forwarded to the internal log store unless a pipeline is defined that contains the `default` output.
