====
If you want to make configuration changes or deploy applications through the {microshift-short} API with tools other than `kustomize` manifests, you must wait until the Greenboot health checks have finished. This ensures that your changes are not lost if Greenboot rolls your `rpm-ostree` system back to an earlier state.
