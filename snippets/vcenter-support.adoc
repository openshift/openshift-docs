[NOTE]
====
{product-title} supports deploying a cluster into up to three VMware vCenters. Deploying a cluster with machines/machine sets on multiple vCenters is a Technology Preview feature only.  Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
