Using node affinity with taints and tolerations:: When a scheduler computes the set of nodes to schedule a pod, tolerations can broaden the set while node affinity restricts the set. If you set a taint on nodes that have a specific architecture, you must also add a toleration to workloads that you want to be scheduled there.
