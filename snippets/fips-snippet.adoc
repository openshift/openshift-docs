To enable FIPS mode for your cluster, you must run the installation program from a {op-system-base-full} computer configured to operate in FIPS mode. For more information about configuring FIPS mode on {op-system-base}, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/security_hardening/switching-rhel-to-fips-mode_security-hardening[Switching {op-system-base} to FIPS mode].

When running {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.
