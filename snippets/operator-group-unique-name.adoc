[WARNING]
====
You must use a unique name that does not conflict with any of the existing cluster role bindings on a cluster or other Operator groups on the cluster.

If your Operator group shares a name with an existing cluster role binding, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) overwrites the previously existing cluster role. This can lead to unpredictable behaviour, such as getting locked out of the cluster.

If an Operator group shares a name with another Operator group in a different namespace, the two Operator groups get stuck in a loop and continuously overwrite each other.
