[IMPORTANT]
====
The current solution that {olmv1-first} uses to manage the permissions to install and update cluster extensions is deprecated. Deprecated functionality is still included in {product-title} and continues to be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of this product and is not recommended for new deployments.

Also, there is a known issue in the current permissions management solution. Regular users who are granted permission to install, manage, and update a cluster extension might have a path to privelege escalation.

Workaround: Grant permissions to write cluster catalogs and cluster extensions to existing cluster administrators only.
