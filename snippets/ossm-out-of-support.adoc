// Text snippet included in all Service Mesh v1 assemblies.
// NOTE: The OpenShift docs standards state that snippets should NOT contain xrefs.   https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/blob/main/contributing_to_docs/doc_guidelines.adoc#writing-text-snippets
//Because this snippet contains two xrefs it should ONLY be used in the v1 assemblies and never in a module.
