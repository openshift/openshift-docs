toc::[]

You can use infrastructure nodes to isolate infrastructure workloads for two primary purposes:

* To prevent billing costs associated with the number of subscriptions
* To separate maintenance and management

With {gitops-shortname} control plane workloads, you can securely and declaratively isolate the infrastructure workloads by creating multiple isolated Argo CD instances in a cluster, with full control over what an Argo CD instance is capable of. In addition, you can manage these Argo CD instances declaratively across multiple developer namespaces. By using taints, you can ensure that only infrastructure components run on these nodes.
