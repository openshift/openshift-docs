:FeatureName: {ServerlessProductName} IntegrationSink feature
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

The `IntegrationSink` API is a Knative Eventing custom resource (CR) that enables you to send events from Knative into external systems. It leverages selected Kamelets from the Apache Camel project.

Kamelets act as reusable connectors that can function either as sources or sinks.By using an `IntegrationSink` API, you can reliably deliver CloudEvents produced within Knative Eventing to third-party services and external systems.

{ServerlessProductName} supports the following Kamelet sinks:

* AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) 
* AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) 
* AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS) 
* Generic logger sink
