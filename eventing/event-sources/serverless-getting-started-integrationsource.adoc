:FeatureName: {ServerlessProductName} IntegrationSource feature
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

The `IntegrationSource` API is a Knative Eventing custom resource (CR) that enables you to connect to external systems by leveraging selected Kamelets from the Apache Camel project.

Kamelets act as reusable connectors that can function either as sources or sinks. By using an `IntegrationSource` API, you can consume data from external systems and forward the data as CloudEvents into Knative Eventing.

{ServerlessProductName} supports the following Kamelet sources:

* AWS DynamoDB Streams
* AWS S3
* AWS SQS
* Timer Source
