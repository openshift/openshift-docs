`EventTransform` is a Knative API resource that enables declarative transformations of HTTP requests and responses without requiring custom code. With `EventTransform`, you can:

* Modify the event attributes
* Extract data from the event payloads
* Reshape events to meet the requirements of different systems

`EventTransform` is designed as a flexible component in an event-driven architecture. You can place it at various points in the event flow to support seamless integration between diverse producers and consumers.

[NOTE]
====
`EventTransform` is an addressable resource and can be referenced from Knative sources, triggers, and subscriptions.
