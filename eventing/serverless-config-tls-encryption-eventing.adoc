With the transport encryption feature, you can transport data and events over secured and encrypted HTTPS connections by using  _Transport Layer Security_ (TLS).


The `transport-encryption` feature flag is an `enum` configuration that defines how Addressables, such as Broker, Channel, and Sink, accept events. It controls whether Addressables must accept events over HTTP or HTTPS based on the selected setting.

The possible values for `transport-encryption` are as follows:
[cols=2,options=header]
|===
|Value
|Description

|`disabled`
a|
* Addressables can accept events to HTTPS endpoints.
* Producers can send events to HTTPS endpoints.

|`permissive`
a|
* Addressables must accept events on both HTTP and HTTPS endpoints.
* Addressables must advertise both HTTP and HTTPS endpoints.
* Producers must send events to HTTPS endpoints, if available.

|`strict`
a|
* Addressables must not accept events to non-HTTPS endpoints.
* Addressables must only advertise HTTPS endpoints.
