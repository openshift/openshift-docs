toc::[]

Knative Eventing provides a mechanism to secure event delivery to prevent unauthorized access. Event-driven systems often rely on multiple producers and consumers of events, and without proper authorization controls, malicious or unintended event flows could compromise the system.

To achieve fine-grained access control, Knative Eventing introduces the EventPolicy custom resource. This resource allows administrators and developers to define which entities are authorized to send events to specific consumers within a namespace. By applying EventPolicies, you can ensure that only trusted event sources or service accounts are able to send data to selected event consumers and this improves the overall security posture of their event-driven architecture.

[NOTE]
====
You must enable the `transport-encryption` feature flag along with `authentication-oidc` to ensure secure and authenticated event delivery.
