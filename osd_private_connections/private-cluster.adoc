An {product-title} cluster can be made private so that internal applications can be hosted inside a corporate network. In addition, private clusters can be configured to have only internal API endpoints for increased security.

{product-title} administrators can choose between public and private cluster configuration from within the *OpenShift Cluster Manager* (OCM). Privacy settings can be configured during cluster creation or after a cluster is established.
