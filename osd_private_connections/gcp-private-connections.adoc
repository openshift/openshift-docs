If your {product-title} cluster privacy is set to *Private*, you must configure private connections in your {GCP} account to access the cluster.

You can use one or more of the following methods to establish a private connection to your cluster:

* Configuring GCP VPC peering: Enable Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) peering to route network traffic between two private IP addresses.

* Configuring GCP HA VPN peering: Establish a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to securely connect your private network to your GCP VPC.

* Configuring GCP Cloud Interconnect


.Prerequisites

- Your GCP account has been configured for use with {product-title}.

[NOTE]
====
At this time, private clusters are only enabled for Customer Cloud Subscriptions (CCS) on GCP.
====

- A GCP user and project has been created.
