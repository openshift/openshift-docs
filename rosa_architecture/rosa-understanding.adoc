{product-title} (ROSA) is a fully-managed, turnkey application platform that allows you to focus on delivering value to your customers by building and deploying applications. Red{nbsp}Hat site reliability engineering (SRE) experts manage the underlying platform so you do not have to worry about the complexity of infrastructure management. ROSA provides seamless integration with Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and a wide range of additional AWS services to further accelerate the building and delivering of differentiating experiences to your customers.

You subscribe to the service directly from your AWS account. After you create clusters, you can operate your clusters with the OpenShift web console, the ROSA CLI, or through {cluster-manager-first}.

You receive OpenShift updates with new feature releases and a shared, common source for alignment with OpenShift Container Platform. ROSA supports the same versions of OpenShift as Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Dedicated and OpenShift Container Platform to achieve version consistency.

ROSA uses of AWS Security Token Service (STS) to obtain credentials to manage infrastructure in your AWS account. AWS STS is a global web service that creates temporary credentials for IAM users or federated users. ROSA uses this to assign short-term, limited-privilege, security credentials. These credentials are associated with IAM roles that are specific to each component that makes AWS API calls. This method aligns with the principals of least privilege and secure practices in cloud service resource management. The ROSA CLI manages the STS credentials that are assigned for unique tasks and takes action on AWS resources as part of OpenShift functionality.
//For a detailed explanation, see "ROSA with STS Explained" (add xref when page is migrated).

== Product details
=== ROSA and Kubernetes
In ROSA, everything you need to deploy and manage containers is bundled, including container management, Operators, networking, load balancing, service mesh, CI/CD, firewall, monitoring, registry, authentication, and authorization capabilities. These components are tested together for unified operations as a complete platform. Automated cluster operations, including over-the-air platform upgrades, further enhance your Kubernetes experience.

=== Basic responsibilities
In general, cluster deployment and upkeep is Red{nbsp}Hat's or AWS's responsibility, while applications, users, and data is the customer's responsibility. For a more detailed breakdown of responsibilities, see the xref:../../rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-policy-responsibility-matrix.adoc#rosa-policy-responsibility-matrix[responsibility matrix].

==== Service-level agreement (SLA)
Refer to the xref:../../rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-service-definition.adoc#rosa-sdpolicy-sla_rosa-service-definition[ROSA SLA] page for details.

=== Roadmap and feature requests
Visit the link:https://github.com/openshift-cs/managed-openshift/projects/2[ROSA roadmap] to stay up-to-date with the status of features currently in development. Open a new issue if you have any suggestions for the product team.

=== Compliance certifications
ROSA is currently compliant with SOC-2 type 2, SOC 3, ISO-27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, HIPAA, GDPR, and PCI-DSS. We are also currently working towards FedRAMP High.

=== Nodes
==== Worker nodes across multiple AWS regions
All nodes in a ROSA cluster must be located in the same AWS region. For clusters configured for multiple availability zones, control plane nodes and worker nodes will be distributed across the availability zones.

==== Minimum and maxicum number of worker nodes
For a ROSA cluster, the minimum is 2 worker nodes for single availability zone and 3 worker nodes for multiple availability zones.

The maximum number of worker nodes is 180 worker nodes for each ROSA cluster. See xref:../../rosa_planning/rosa-limits-scalability.adoc#rosa-limits-scalability[limits and scalability] for more details on node counts.

==== Underlying node operating system
As with all OpenShift v4.x offerings, the control plane, infra and worker nodes run Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS).

==== Supported instances for worker nodes
For a complete list of supported instances for worker nodes see xref:../../rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-service-definition.adoc#rosa-sdpolicy-aws-instance-types_rosa-service-definition[AWS instance types]. Spot instances are also supported.

==== Node autoscaling
Autoscaling allows you to automatically adjust the size of the cluster based on the current workload. See xref:../../rosa_cluster_admin/rosa_nodes/rosa-nodes-about-autoscaling-nodes.adoc#rosa-nodes-about-autoscaling-nodes[About autoscaling nodes on a cluster] for more details.

=== Administrator
A ROSA customer's administrator can manage users and quotas in addition to accessing all user-created projects.

=== OpenShift versions and upgrades
ROSA is a managed service which is based on OpenShift Container Platform. You can view the current version and life cycle dates in the xref:../../rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-life-cycle.adoc#rosa-life-cycle-dates_rosa-life-cycle[ROSA documentation].

Customers can upgrade to the newest version of OpenShift and use the features from that version of OpenShift. For more information, see xref:../../rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-life-cycle.adoc#rosa-life-cycle-dates_rosa-life-cycle[life cycle dates]. Not all OpenShift features are be available on ROSA. Review the xref:../../rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-service-definition.adoc#rosa-service-definition[Service Definition] for more information.

=== Support
You can open a ticket directly from the {cluster-manager-url}. See the xref:../../support/getting-support.adoc#getting-support[ROSA support documentation] for more details about obtaining support.

You can also visit the link:http://access.redhat.com/[Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal] to search or browse through the Red{nbsp}Hat knowledge base of articles and solutions relating to Red{nbsp}Hat products or submit a support case to Red{nbsp}Hat Support.

==== Limited support
If a ROSA cluster is not upgraded before the "end of life" date, the cluster continues to operate in a limited support status. The SLA for that cluster will no longer be applicable, but you can still get support for that cluster. See the xref:../../rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-life-cycle.adoc#rosa-life-cycle[limited support status] documentation for more details.

AWS support customers must have a valid AWS support contract

=== Notifications and communication
Red{nbsp}Hat will provide notifications regarding new Red{nbsp}Hat and AWS features, updates, and scheduled maintenance through email and the {hybrid-console-second} service log.

=== Offboarding
Customers can stop using ROSA at any time and move their applications to on-premise, a private cloud, or other cloud providers. Standard reserved instances (RI) policy applies for unused RI.

=== Authentication
ROSA supports the following authentication mechanisms: OpenID Connect (a profile of OAuth2), Google OAuth, GitHub OAuth, GitLab, and LDAP.

=== SRE cluster access
All SRE cluster access is secured by MFA. See xref:../../rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-sre-access.adoc#rosa-sre-access[SRE access] for more details.

=== Encryption

==== Encryption keys
ROSA uses a key stored in KMS to encrypt EBS volumes. Customers also have the option to provide their own KMS keys at cluster creation.

==== KMS keys
If you specify a KMS key, the control plane, infrastructure and worker node root volumes and the persistent volumes are encrypted with the key.

==== Data encryption
By default, there is encryption at rest. The AWS Storage platform automatically encrypts your data before persisting it and decrypts the data before retrieval. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html[AWS EBS Encryption] for more details.

You can also encrypt etcd in the cluster, combining it with AWS storage encryption. This results in double the encryption which adds up to a 20% performance hit. For more details see the xref:../../rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-service-definition.adoc#rosa-service-definition[etcd encryption] documentation.

==== etcd encryption
etcd encryption can only be enabled at cluster creation.

[NOTE]
====
etcd encryption incurs additional overhead with negligible security risk mitigation.
====

etcd encryption is configured with an aescbc cypher and the setting is patched during cluster deployment. For more details, see the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/[Kubernetes documentation].

==== Multi-region KMS keys for EBS encryption
Currently, the ROSA CLI does not accept multi-region KMS keys for EBS encryption. This feature is in our backlog for product updates. The ROSA CLI accepts single region KMS keys for EBS encryption if it is defined at cluster creation.

=== Infrastructure
ROSA uses several different cloud services such as virtual machines, storage, and load balancers. You can see a defined list in the xref:../../rosa_planning/rosa-sts-aws-prereqs.adoc#rosa-aws-policy-provisioned_rosa-sts-aws-prereqs[AWS prerequisites].

=== Storage
Refer to the xref:../../rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-service-definition.adoc#rosa-sdpolicy-storage_rosa-service-definition[storage] section of the service definition.

OpenShift includes the CSI driver for AWS EFS. For more information, see xref:../../storage/container_storage_interface/osd-persistent-storage-aws-efs-csi.adoc#osd-persistent-storage-aws-efs-csi[Setting up AWS EFS for Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Service on AWS].

=== Using a VPC
At installation you can select to deploy to an existing VPC or bring your own VPC. You can then select the required subnets and provide a valid CIDR range that encompasses the subnets for the installation program when using those subnets.

ROSA allows multiple clusters to share the same VPC. The number of clusters on one VPC is limited by the remaining AWS resource quota and CIDR ranges that cannot overlap. See xref:../../networking/cidr-range-definitions.adoc#cidr-range-definitions[CIDR Range Definitions] for more information.

=== Network plugin
ROSA uses the OpenShift OVN-Kubernetes default CNI network provider.

=== Cross-namespace networking
Cluster admins can customize, and deny, cross-namespace on a project basis using NetworkPolicy objects. Refer to xref:../../networking/network_security/network_policy/multitenant-network-policy.adoc#nw-networkpolicy-multitenant-isolation_multitenant-network-policy[Configuring multitenant isolation with network policy] for more information.

=== Using Prometheus and Grafana
You can use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor containers and manage capacity using OpenShift User Workload Monitoring. This is a check-box option in the {cluster-manager-url}.

=== Audit logs output from the cluster control-plane
If the Cluster Logging Operator Add-on has been added to the cluster then audit logs are available through CloudWatch. If it has not, then a support request would allow you to request some audit logs. Small targeted and time-boxed logs can be requested for export and sent to a customer. The selection of audit logs available are at the discretion of SRE in the category of platform security and compliance. Requests for exports of a cluster's entirety of logs will be rejected.

=== AWS Permissions Boundary
You can use an AWS Permissions Boundary around the policies for your cluster.

=== AMI
ROSA worker nodes use a different AMI from OSD and OpenShift Container Platform. Control Plane and Infra node AMIs are common across products in the same version.

=== Cluster backups
ROSA STS clusters do not have backups. Users must have their own backup policies for applications and data. See our xref:../../rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-service-definition.adoc#rosa-sdpolicy-backup-policy_rosa-service-definition[backup policy] for more information.

=== Custom domain
You can define a custom domain for your applications. See xref:../../applications/deployments/rosa-config-custom-domains-applications.adoc#rosa-config-custom-domains-applications[Configuring custom domains for applications] for more information.

= ROSA domain certificates
Red{nbsp}Hat infrastructure (Hive) manages certificate rotation for default application ingress.

=== Disconnected environments
ROSA does not support an air-gapped, disconnected environment. The ROSA cluster must have egress to the internet to access our registry, S3, and send metrics. The service requires a number of egress endpoints.
Ingress can be limited to a PrivateLink for Red{nbsp}Hat SREs and a VPN for customer access.
