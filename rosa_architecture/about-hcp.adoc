//IMPORTANT!!!

ROSA is a fully-managed turnkey application platform that allows you to focus on what matters most, delivering value to your customers by building and deploying applications. Red{nbsp}Hat and AWS SRE experts manage the underlying platform so you do not have to worry about infrastructure management. ROSA provides seamless integration with a wide range of AWS compute, database, analytics, machine learning, networking, mobile, and other services to further accelerate the building and delivering of differentiating experiences to your customers.

{hcp-title-first} offers a reduced-cost solution to create a managed ROSA cluster with a focus on efficiency. You can quickly create a new cluster and deploy applications in minutes.

You subscribe to the service directly from your AWS account. After you create clusters, you can operate your clusters with the OpenShift web console, the ROSA CLI, or through {cluster-manager-first}.

You receive OpenShift updates with new feature releases and a shared, common source for alignment with OpenShift Container Platform. ROSA supports the same versions of OpenShift as Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Dedicated and OpenShift Container Platform to achieve version consistency.

ROSA uses AWS Security Token Service (STS) to obtain credentials to manage infrastructure in your AWS account. AWS STS is a global web service that creates temporary credentials for IAM users or federated users. ROSA uses this to assign short-term, limited-privilege, security credentials. These credentials are associated with IAM roles that are specific to each component that makes AWS API calls. This method aligns with the principals of least privilege and secure practices in cloud service resource management. The ROSA command line interface (CLI) tool manages the STS credentials that are assigned for unique tasks and takes action on AWS resources as part of OpenShift functionality. For a more detailed explanation, see xref:../rosa_architecture/cloud-experts-rosa-hcp-sts-explained.adoc#cloud-experts-rosa-hcp-sts-explained[AWS STS and ROSA with HCP explained].

== Key features of {hcp-title}

* *Cluster node scaling:* {hcp-title} requires a minimum of only two nodes, making it ideal for smaller projects while still being able to scale to support larger projects and enterprises. Easily add or remove compute nodes to match resource demand. Autoscaling allows you to automatically adjust the size of the cluster based on the current workload. See

* *Fully managed underlying control plane infrastructure:* Control plane components, such as the API server and etcd database, are hosted in a Red{nbsp}Hat-owned AWS account.
* *Rapid provisioning time:* Provisioning time is approximately 10 minutes.
* *Continued cluster operation during upgrades:* Customers can upgrade the control plane and machine pools separately, which means they do not have to shut down the entire cluster during upgrades.
* *Native AWS service:* Access and use Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift on-demand with a self-service onboarding experience through the AWS management console.
* *Flexible, consumption-based pricing:* Scale to your business needs and pay as you go with flexible pricing and an on-demand hourly or annual billing model.
* *Single bill for Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift and AWS usage:* Customers will receive a single bill from AWS for both Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift and AWS consumption.
* *Fully integrated support experience:* Installation, management, maintenance, and upgrades are performed by Red{nbsp}Hat site reliability engineers (SREs) with joint Red{nbsp}Hat and Amazon support and a 99.95% service-level agreement (SLA). See the

xref:../support/getting-support.adoc#getting-support[ROSA support documentation] for more details.
endif::openshift-rosa[]
* *AWS service integration:* AWS has a robust portfolio of cloud services, such as compute, storage, networking, database, analytics, and machine learning. All of these services are directly accessible through ROSA. This makes it easier to build, operate, and scale globally and on-demand through a familiar management interface.
* *Maximum availability:* Deploy clusters across multiple availability zones in supported regions to maximize availability and maintain high availability for your most demanding mission-critical applications and data.
* *Optimized clusters:* Choose from memory-optimized, compute-optimized, or general purpose EC2 instance types with clusters sized to meet your needs.
* *Global availability:* Refer to the xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-hcp-service-definition.adoc#rosa-sdpolicy-regions-az_rosa-hcp-service-definition[product regional availability page] to see where ROSA is available globally.
