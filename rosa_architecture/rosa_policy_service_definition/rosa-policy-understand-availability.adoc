= About availability for {product-title}

toc::[]

Availability and disaster avoidance are extremely important aspects of any application platform. Although {product-title} (ROSA) provides many protections against failures at several levels, customer-deployed applications must be appropriately configured for high availability. To account for outages that might occur with cloud providers, additional options are available such as deploying a cluster across multiple availability zones and maintaining multiple clusters with failover mechanisms.
