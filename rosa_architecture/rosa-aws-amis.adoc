clusters. For more information, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html#ami-using[Amazon Machine Images (AMI)] in the AWS documentation.

You must use the image version that is the same as the AMI version when you installed your cluster. For example, if you installed the cluster using 4.14, but your cluster is on OpenShift version 4.16, you must still allow for AMIs that use the OpenShift version 4.14 because new instances use the same AMI version.
