{hcp-title-first} uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS) to provide temporary, limited-permission credentials for your cluster. This means that before you deploy your cluster,

you must create the following AWS Identity Access Management (IAM) resources:

* Specific account-wide IAM roles and policies that provide the STS permissions required for ROSA support, installation,

and compute functionality. This includes account-wide Operator policies.
* Cluster-specific Operator IAM roles that permit the ROSA cluster Operators to carry out core OpenShift functionality.
* An OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider that the cluster Operators use to authenticate.
* If you deploy and manage your cluster using {cluster-manager}, you must create the following additional resources:
** An {cluster-manager} IAM role to complete the installation on your cluster.
** A user role without any permissions to verify your AWS account identity.

== {cluster-manager} roles and permissions

If you create ROSA clusters by using {cluster-manager-url}, you must have the following AWS IAM roles linked to your AWS account to create and manage the clusters.
ifndef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
For more information about linking your IAM roles to your AWS account, see xref:../rosa_planning/rosa-sts-aws-prereqs.adoc#rosa-associating-account_rosa-sts-aws-prereqs[Associating your AWS account].
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]

These AWS IAM roles are as follows:

* The ROSA user role (`user-role`) is an AWS role used by Red{nbsp}Hat to verify the customer's AWS identity. This role has no additional permissions, and the role has a trust relationship with the Red{nbsp}Hat installer account.
* An `ocm-role` resource grants the required permissions for installation of ROSA clusters in {cluster-manager}. You can apply basic or administrative permissions to the `ocm-role` resource. If you create an administrative `ocm-role` resource, {cluster-manager} can create the needed AWS Operator roles and OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. This IAM role also creates a trust relationship with the Red{nbsp}Hat installer account as well.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `ocm-role` IAM resource refers to the combination of the IAM role and the necessary policies created with it.
====

You must create this user role as well as an administrative `ocm-role` resource, if you want to use the auto mode in {cluster-manager} to create your Operator role policies and OIDC provider.

== Open ID Connect (OIDC) requirements for Operator authentication

For ROSA installations that use STS, you must create a cluster-specific OIDC provider that is used by the cluster Operators to authenticate or create your own OIDC configuration for your own OIDC provider.
