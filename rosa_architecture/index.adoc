xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi.adoc#persistent-storage-using-csi[Container Storage Interface (CSI)],
and more.
You can xref:../storage/expanding-persistent-volumes.adoc#expanding-persistent-volumes[expand persistent volumes], configure xref:../storage/dynamic-provisioning.adoc#dynamic-provisioning[dynamic provisioning], and use CSI to xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi.adoc#persistent-storage-using-csi[configure], xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-cloning.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-cloning[clone], and use xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-snapshots.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-snapshots[snapshots] of persistent storage.

- **xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-smb-cifs.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-smb-cifs[Persistent storage using CIFS/SMB CSI Driver Operator (Technology Preview)]**: {product-title} is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) with a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for the Common Internet File System (CIFS) dialect/Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. The CIFS/SMB CSI Driver Operator that manages this driver is in Technology Preview status.

- **xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-snapshots.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-snapshots-overview_persistent-storage-csi-snapshots[Changing vSphere CSI maximum number of snapshots]**:  The default maximum number of snapshots in {vmw-first} Container Storage Interface (CSI) is 3 per volume. In {product-title} {product-version}, you can now change this maximum number of snapshots to a maximum of 32 per volume. You also have granular control of the maximum number of snapshots for vSAN and Virtual Volume datastores.

- **xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi.adoc#persistent-storage-csi[Volume cloning supported for Azure File (Technology Preview)]**: {product-title} {product-version} introduces volume cloning for the Microsoft Azure File Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver Operator as a Technology Preview feature.

- **xref:../storage/understanding-persistent-storage.adoc#pv-access-modes_understanding-persistent-storage[RWOP with SELinux context mount]**: {product-title} {product-version} changes feature status from Technical Preview status to generally available for the access mode `ReadWriteOncePod` (RWOP). RWOP can be used only in a single pod on a single node. If the driver enables it, RWOP uses the SELinux context mount set in the PodSpec or container, which allows the driver to mount the volume directly with the correct SELinux labels.

== Cluster administrator activities

While cluster maintenance and host configuration is performed by the Red Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team, other ongoing tasks on your {product-title} {product-version} cluster can be performed by {product-title} cluster administrators. As an {product-title} cluster administrator, the documentation helps you:

- *Manage Dedicated Administrators*: Grant or revoke permissions to `dedicated admin` users.
- *Work with Logging*: Learn about OpenShift Logging and configure the Cluster Logging Operator.
- *Monitor clusters*: Learn to use the Web UI to access monitoring dashboards.
- *Manage nodes*: Learn to manage nodes, including configuring machine pools and autoscaling.
