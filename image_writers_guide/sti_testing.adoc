== Overview
As an STI builder image author, you can test your STI image locally and use the OpenShift build system for automated testing and continuous integration.

NOTE: See the link:sti.html[STI Requirements] topic to learn more about the STI architecture before proceeding.

As described in the link:sti.html[STI Requirements] topic, STI requires the `assemble` and `run` scripts to be present in order to successfully execute the STI build. Providing the `save-artifacts` script reuses the build artifacts, and providing the `usage` script ensures that usage information is printed to console when someone runs the Docker image outside of the STI.

The goal of testing an STI image is to make sure that all of these described commands work properly, even if the base Docker image has changed or the tooling used by the commands was updated.

== Testing Requirements
The standard location for the `test` script is [filename]#test/run#. This script is invoked by the OpenShift STI image builder and it could be a simple Bash script or a static Go binary.

Because the `test/run` script performs the STI build, you must have the STI binary available on your system. See the STI https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/blob/master/README.md#installation[README] file and follow the installation instructions if required.

Because STI puts together the application source code and Docker image, to test it you need a sample application source you can use during the test to verify that the application source is successfully converted into a Docker image. The sample application should be simple, but it should also exercise the `assemble` command.

== Using `sti create`
The STI tooling comes with powerful generation tools to speed up the process of creating a new STI image. The https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/blob/master/docs/cli.md#sti-create[`sti create` command] produces all necessary STI scripts and testing tools along with the [filename]#Makefile#. The generated [filename]#test/run# script must be adjusted to be useful, but it provides a good starting point to begin developing.

NOTE: The [filename]#test/run# script produced by the `sti create` command requires that the sample application sources are inside the [filename]#test/test-app# directory.

== Testing Locally
The easiest way to run the STI image tests locally is to use the generated [filename]#Makefile#. If you did not use the `sti create` command, you can copy the following [filename]#Makefile# template and replace the `IMAGE_NAME` parameter with your image name.

.Sample Makefile
====

----
IMAGE_NAME = openshift/ruby-20-centos

build:
	docker build -t $(IMAGE_NAME) .

.PHONY: test
test:
	docker build -t $(IMAGE_NAME)-candidate .
	IMAGE_NAME=$(IMAGE_NAME)-candidate test/run
----

== Basic Testing Workflow
The `test` script assumes you have already built the image that you want to test. If required, first build the STI image using:

----
docker build -t BUILDER_IMAGE_NAME
----

The following steps describe the default workflow to test STI image builders:

. Verify the `usage` script is working:
+
----
docker run BUILDER_IMAGE_NAME
----
+
. Build the image:
+
----
sti build file:///path-to-sample-app BUILDER_IMAGE_NAME OUTPUT_APPLICATION_IMAGE_NAME
----
+
. If you support `save-artifacts`, execute step 2 again to verify that restoring artifacts works properly.
+
. Run the container:
+
----
docker run OUTPUT_APPLICATION_IMAGE_NAME
----
. Verify the container is running and the application is responding.

Executing these steps is generally enough to tell if the STI scripts are operating properly.

== Using OpenShift Build for Automated Testing
Another way you can execute the STI image tests is to use the OpenShift platform itself as a continuous integration system. The OpenShift platform is capable of building Docker images and is highly customizable.

To set up a STI image builder CI, define a special `CustomBuild` and use the [sysitem]#openshift/sti-image-builder# image. This image executes all the steps mentioned in the link:#basic-testing-workflow[Basic Testing Workflow] section and creates a new STI builder image.

.Sample `CustomBuild`

      }
    },
    "strategy": {
      "type": "Custom",
      "customStrategy": {
        "image": "openshift/sti-image-builder",
        "exposeDockerSocket": true,
        "env": [
          { "name": "IMAGE_NAME", "value": "openshift/ruby-20-centos"}
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "labels": {
    "name": "ruby-20-centos-build"
  }
}
----
====

You can use the `osc create` command to create this `BuildConfig`. After the `BuildConfig` is created, you can start the build using the following command:

----
osc start-build ruby-20-centos-build
----

If your OpenShift instance is hosted on a public IP address, then the build is triggered each time you push into your STI builder image GitHub repository.

You can also use the `CustomBuild` to trigger a rebuild for your applications based on the STI image you updated. In that case, you must specify the `Output` field in the `parameters` section and define to which Docker registry the image should be pushed after a successful build.
