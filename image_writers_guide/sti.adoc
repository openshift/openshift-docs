== Overview
link:../architecture/openshift_model.html#source-to-image[Source-to-Image (STI)] is a framework which makes it easy to write images that take application source code as an input and produce a new image that runs the assembled application as output.

The main advantage of using STI for building reproducible Docker images is the ease of use for developers. As a builder image author, you must be aware of the two basic requirements for the best possible STI performance: the required image contents and STI scripts.

== Required Image Contents
The build process consists of three fundamental elements which are combined into a final Docker image:

- sources
- STI scripts
- builder image

During the build process, STI must place sources and scripts inside the builder image. To do so, STI creates a tar file that contains the sources and scripts, then streams that file into the builder image. Before executing the `sti assemble` script, STI untars that file and places its contents into the location specified with the `--location` flag or the `STI_LOCATION` environment variable from the builder image, with the default location being the [filename]#/tmp# directory.

For this tar process to happen, your image must supply the tar archiving utility (the `tar` command available in [filename]#$PATH#) and the command line interpreter (the `/bin/sh` command); this allows your image to use the fastest possible build path. If the `tar` or `/bin/sh` command is not available, the `sti build` script is forced to automatically perform an additional Docker build to put both the sources and the scripts inside the image, and only then run the usual `sti build` procedure.

See the following diagram for the basic STI build workflow:

.Build workflow
image::sti-flow.png[STI workflow]

////
* Run build's responsibility is to untar the sources, scripts and artifacts (if such exist) and invoke `assemble` script. If this is second run (after catching `tar`/`/bin/sh` error) it's responsible only for invoking `assemble` script, since both scripts and sources are already there.
////

== STI Scripts
You can write STI scripts in any programming language as long as the scripts are executable inside the builder image.

.STI Scripts
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Script |Description

|[filename]#assemble#
(required)
|The [filename]#assemble# script builds the application artifacts from source and places them into appropriate directories inside the image. The workflow for this script is:

. Restore build artifacts. If you want to support incremental builds, make sure to define link:#save-artifacts[`save-artifacts`] as well.
. Place the application source in the desired location.
. Build the application artifacts.
. Install the artifacts into locations appropriate for them to run.

|[filename]#run#
(required)
|The [filename]#run# script executes your application.

|[filename]#save-artifacts#
(optional)
|The [filename]#save-artifacts# script gathers all dependencies that can speed up the build processes that follow. For example:

- For Ruby, `gems` is installed by Bundler.
- For Java, `.m2` contents are installed.

These dependencies are gathered into a tar file and streamed to the standard output.

|[filename]#usage#
(optional)
|The [filename]#usage# script allows you to inform the user how to properly use your image.

|[filename]#test/run#
(optional)
|The [filename]#test/run# script allows you to create a simple process to check if the image is working correctly. The proposed flow of that process is:

. Build the image.
. Run the image to verify the [filename]#usage# script.
. Run `sti build` to verify the [filename]#assemble# script.
. Run `sti build` again to verify the [filename]#save-artifacts# script and the [filename]#usage# script's restore artifacts functionality. (optional)
. Run the image to verify the test application is working.

See the link:sti_testing.html[Testing STI Images] topic for more information.

NOTE: The suggested location to put the test application built by your [filename]#test/run# script is the [filename]#test/test-app# directory in your image repository. See the
https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/blob/master/docs/cli.md#sti-create[STI documentation] for more information.

*Example STI Scripts*

NOTE: The following examples are written in Bash and it is assumed all tar contents are unpacked into the [filename]#/tmp/sti# directory.

.[filename]#assemble# script:
====

----
#!/bin/bash

# restore build artifacts
if [ "$(ls /tmp/sti/artifacts/ 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
    mv /tmp/sti/artifacts/* $HOME/.
fi

# move the application source
mv /tmp/sti/src $HOME/src

# build application artifacts
pushd ${HOME}
make all

# install the artifacts
make install
popd
----
====

.[filename]#run# script:
====

----
#!/bin/bash

# run the application
/opt/application/run.sh
----
====

.[filename]#save-artifacts# script:
====

----
#!/bin/bash

pushd ${HOME}
if [ -d deps ]; then
    # all deps contents to tar stream
    tar cf - deps
fi
popd

----
====

.[filename]#usage# script:
====

----
#!/bin/bash

# inform the user how to use the image
cat <<EOF
This is a STI sample builder image, to use it, install

[[using-images-with-onbuild-instructions]]
== Using Images with `ONBUILD` Instructions
The `ONBUILD` instructions can be found in many official Docker images. For example:

- https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/library/ruby[Ruby]
- https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/library/node[Node.js]
- https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/library/python[Python]

See the https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/#onbuild[Docker documentation] for more details about how `ONBUILD` instructions work.

STI has a different strategy when a Docker image with `ONBUILD` instructions is used as a builder image for the application source code. During the STI build, all `ONBUILD` instructions are executed in the order they were defined in the builder image Dockerfile. The STI scripts are not required for this strategy, but they can be used as supplementary scripts to existing `ONBUILD` instructions.

Many official Docker images that use `ONBUILD` do not declare the image `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT`, and for that, STI must know how to run your application. There are two methods for defining the `ENTRYPOINT`:

- The first method is to include the [filename]#run# script in your application root folder. STI then recognizes it and sets it as the application image `ENTRYPOINT`.

- The second method is to use the STI scripts. If you provide the URL from where the STI can fetch the scripts, the STI [filename]#run# script is then set as an image `ENTRYPOINT`. If the STI scripts location also includes the [filename]#assemble# script, the script is then executed as the last instruction of the Docker build.
