{rosa-classic-first} and Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) support storing persistent volumes with either link:https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/[Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Block Store (EBS)] or link:https://aws.amazon.com/efs/[AWS Elastic File System (EFS)].

== Using persistent volumes
Use the following procedures to create a file, store it on a persistent volume in your cluster, and confirm that it still exists after pod failure and re-creation.

=== Viewing a persistent volume claim
. Navigate to the cluster's OpenShift web console.
. Click *Storage* in the left menu, then click *PersistentVolumeClaims* to see a list of all the persistent volume claims. 
. Click a persistence volume claim to see the size, access mode, storage class, and other additional claim details. 
+
[NOTE]
====
The access mode is `ReadWriteOnce` (RWO). This means that the volume can only be mounted to one node and the pod or pods can read and write to the volume.
====

=== Storing your file

. In the OSToy app console, click *Persistent Storage* in the left menu.
. In the *Filename* box, enter a file name with a `.txt` extension, for example `test-pv.txt`.
. In the *File contents* box, enter a sentence of text, for example `OpenShift is the greatest thing since sliced bread!`.
. Click *Create file*.

. Scroll to *Existing files* on the OSToy app console.
. Click the file you created to see the file name and contents.

=== Crashing the pod

. On the OSToy app console, click *Home* in the left menu.
. Click *Crash pod*.

=== Confirming persistent storage

. Wait for the pod to re-create.
. On the OSToy app console, click *Persistent Storage* in the left menu.
. Find the file you created, and open it to view and confirm the contents.

.Verification
The deployment YAML file shows that we mounted link:https://github.com/openshift-cs/rosaworkshop/blob/master/rosa-workshop/ostoy/yaml/ostoy-frontend-deployment.yaml#L61[the directory] `/var/demo_files` to our persistent volume claim.

. Retrieve the name of your front-end pod by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods
----
+
. Start a secure shell (SSH) session in your container by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rsh <pod_name>
----
+
. Go to the directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd /var/demo_files
----
+
. *Optional:* See all the files you created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ls
----
+
. Open the file to view the contents by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat test-pv.txt
----
+
. Verify that the output is the text you entered in the OSToy app console.
+
.Example terminal
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods
