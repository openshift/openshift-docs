[role="_abstract"]
After successfully provisioning your cluster, you can deploy an application on it. This application allows you to become more familiar with some of the features of {product-title} and Kubernetes.

== Lab overview
In this lab, you will complete the following set of tasks designed to help you understand the concepts of deploying and operating container-based applications:

* Deploy a Node.js based app by using S2I and Kubernetes Deployment objects.
* Set up a continuous delivery (CD) pipeline to automatically push source code changes.
* Explore logging.
* Experience self healing of applications.
* Explore configuration management through configmaps, secrets, and environment variables.
* Use persistent storage to share data across pod restarts.
* Explore networking within Kubernetes and applications.
* Familiarize yourself with ROSA and Kubernetes functionality.
* Automatically scale pods based on loads from the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.
* Use AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK) to deploy and use an S3 bucket.

This lab uses either the {rosa-cli} or {product-title} web user interface (UI).
