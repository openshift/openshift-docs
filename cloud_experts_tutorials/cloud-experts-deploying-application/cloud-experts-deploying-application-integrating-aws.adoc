Although the OSToy application functions independently, many real-world applications require external services such as databases, object stores, or messaging services.

**Objectives**

* Learn how to integrate the OSToy application with other Amazon Web Services (AWS) services, specifically AWS S3 Storage. By the end of this section, the application will securely create and read objects from AWS S3 Storage.
* Use the Amazon Controller for Kubernetes (ACK) to create the necessary services for our application directly from Kubernetes.
* Use Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles for service accounts to manage access and authentication.
* Use OSToy to create a basic text file and save it in an S3 bucket.
* Confirm that the file was successfully added and can be read from the bucket.
