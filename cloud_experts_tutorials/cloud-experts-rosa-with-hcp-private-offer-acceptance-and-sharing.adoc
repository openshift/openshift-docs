This guide describes how to accept a private offer for {product-title} and how to ensure that all team members can use the private offer for the clusters they provision.

{product-title} costs are composed of the AWS infrastructure costs and the {product-title} service costs. AWS infrastructure costs, such as the EC2 instances that are running the needed workloads, are charged to the AWS account where the infrastructure is deployed. {product-title} service costs are charged to the AWS account specified as the "AWS billing account" when deploying a cluster.

The cost components can be billed to different AWS accounts. Detailed description of how the {product-title} service cost and AWS infrastructure costs are calculated can be found on the link:https://aws.amazon.com/rosa/pricing/[{product-title} Pricing page].

//Commenting out for now, but we can examine how to incorporate the example scenario 

== Example scenario

* John is developer who briefly tested {product-title} by activating the service using their AWS account 123412341234, then deleted the cluster after the trial was completed.
* John is responsible for the company's main AWS account 111111111111 and manages their AWS organization with several linked AWS accounts.
* John accepts a private offer for {product-title} as described in "Accepting a private offer".
* John connects the AWS account 111111111111, that was used for accepting the private offer, with their Red{nbsp}Hat account right after accepting the private offer as described in "Connecting AWS and Red{nbsp}Hat accounts".
* Anne wants to deploy a new {product-title} cluster. Normally, they use their AWS account 123412341234 which is linked to the master AWS account 111111111111 for all cloud infrastructure needs.
* John makes sure that Anne Red{nbsp}Hat user is in the same Red{nbsp}Hat organization as John’s Red{nbsp}Hat user. John is the Red{nbsp}Hat organization administrator and can do that here.
* Anne visits the {hybrid-console} and starts a new cluster deployment.
* During the initial steps, Anne makes sure to select 111111111111 as the AWS billing account, while using their own AWS account 123412341234 as the AWS infrastructure account.
* Note that Anne is also able to select their own AWS account 123412341234 as the billing account when creating a cluster because they previously activated the {product-title} public offer. However, that would result in custom private offer pricing not being applied to this cluster. Therefore it is important for John to communicate the information about which AWS billing account is to be used by employees when creating a new cluster in order to benefit from a private offer that was accepted before.
