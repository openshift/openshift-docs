//Article text
This guide demonstrates how to modify the Console, Downloads, OAuth domain, and TLS certificate keypair on Red Hat Openshift on AWS (ROSA) and Red Hat Openshift Dedicated (OSD) versions 4.14 and above.{fn-supported-versions}

The changes that we make to the component routes{fn-term-component-routes} in this guide are described in greater detail in the following documentation:

* link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/configuring-internal-oauth.html#customizing-the-oauth-server-url_configuring-internal-oauth[Customizing the internal OAuth server URL]
* link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/web_console/customizing-the-web-console.html#customizing-the-console-route_customizing-web-console[Customizing the console route]
* link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/web_console/customizing-the-web-console.html#customizing-the-download-route_customizing-web-console[Customizing the download route]

== Prerequisites

* ROSA CLI (`rosa`) version 1.2.27 or higher{fn-supported-cli}
* AWS CLI (`aws`)
* OpenShift CLI (`oc`)
* A ROSA or OSD cluster (STS, non-STS, or PrivateLink)
* OpenSSL (for generating the demonstration SSL certificate), which can be downloaded and installed from link:https://www.openssl.org/source/[OpenSSL.org]
* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

== Find the current routes

Before we make any configuration changes, we need to know the current routes in the cluster.

* Verify that you can reach the component routes on their default hostnames.
+
You can find the hostnames by querying the lists of routes in `openshift-console` and `openshift-authentication`.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc get routes -n openshift-console
NAME        HOST/PORT                                                                          PATH       SERVICES    PORT    TERMINATION          WILDCARD
console     console-openshift-console.apps.my-example-cluster-aws.z9a9.p1.openshiftapps.com    ... 1 more  console    https   reencrypt/Redirect   None
downloads   downloads-openshift-console.apps.my-example-cluster-aws.z9a9.p1.openshiftapps.com  ... 1 more  downloads  http    edge/Redirect        None
----
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc get routes -n openshift-authentication
NAME              HOST/PORT                                                             PATH        SERVICES          PORT   TERMINATION            WILDCARD
oauth-openshift   oauth-openshift.apps.my-example-cluster-aws.z9a9.p1.openshiftapps.com ... 1 more  oauth-openshift   6443   passthrough/Redirect   None
----
+
From these commands you can see that our base hostname is `z9a9.p1.openshiftapps.com`.

* Verify that the default ingress exists, and ensure that the base hostname matches that of the component routes.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ rosa list ingress -c <my-example-cluster-aws>
ID    API ENDPOINT                                                   PRIVATE
r3l6  https://apps.my-example-cluster-aws.z9a9.p1.openshiftapps.com  external  true
----
+
Our ingress route shares the base hostname of `z9a9.p1.openshiftapps.com`.
+
Note the ID of the default ingress: `r316`. We will need this to set up new DNS records later.

By running these commands you can see that the default component routes for our cluster are:

* `console-openshift-console.apps.my-example-cluster-aws.z9a9.p1.openshiftapps.com` for Console
* `downloads-openshift-console.apps.my-example-cluster-aws.z9a9.p1.openshiftapps.com` for Downloads
* `oauth-openshift.apps.my-example-cluster-aws.z9a9.p1.openshiftapps.com` for OAuth

We can use the `rosa edit ingress` command to change this base hostname and add a TLS certificate for all of our component routes. The relevant parameters are shown in this excerpt of the command line help for the `rosa edit ingress` command:

[source,bash]
----
$ rosa edit ingress -h
Edit a cluster ingress for a cluster. Usage:
  rosa edit ingress ID [flags]
  [...]
  --cluster-routes-hostname string         Components route hostname for oauth, console, download.
  --cluster-routes-tls-secret-ref string   Components route TLS secret reference for oauth, console, download.
----

Note that when we use this command to change the component routes, it will change the base domain for all three routes at the same time.

If we choose a new base domain of `my-new-domain.dev`, our new component routes for our cluster will be:

* `console-openshift-console.my-new-domain.dev` for Console
* `downloads-openshift-console.my-new-domain.dev` for Downloads
* `oauth-openshift.my-new-domain.dev` for OAuth

== Creating a valid TLS certificate for each component route

In this section, we create a self-signed certificate key pair and then trust it to verify that we can access our new component routes using a real web browser. This is for demonstration purposes only, and is not recommended as a solution for production workloads. Consult your certificate authority to understand how to create a certificate with similar attributes for your production workloads.

To work correctly, the certificate we create needs the following:

* a Common Name (CN) that matches the **wildcard** DNS of the `--cluster-routes-hostname` parameter
* a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) for each component route that **matches** the routes generated by our new hostname

For a base domain of `my-new-domain.dev`, our certificate's subject (`-subj`) looks like this:

----
/CN=*.my-new-domain.dev
----

We also need a SAN for each of our component routes:

----
subjectAltName = DNS:console-openshift-console.my-new-domain.dev
subjectAltName = DNS:downloads-openshift-console.my-new-domain.dev
subjectAltName = DNS:oauth-openshift.my-new-domain.dev
----

We can generate our certificate by running the following `openssl` command:

[source,bash]
----
$ openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 365 -keyout key-my-new-domain.pem -out cert-my-new-domain.pem -subj "/CN=*.my-new-domain.dev" -addext "subjectAltName = DNS:console-openshift-console.my-new-domain.dev, DNS:oauth-openshift.my-new-domain.dev, DNS:downloads-openshift-console.my-new-domain.dev"
----

This generates two `.pem` files, `key-my-new-domain.pem` and `cert-my-new-domain.pem`.

== Adding the certificate to the cluster as a secret

. Log in to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

. Generate a TLS secret in the `openshift-config` namespace.
+
This becomes your secret reference when you update the component routes later in this guide.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc create secret tls component-tls --cert=cert-my-new-domain.pem --key=key-my-new-domain.pem -n openshift-config
----

== Find the hostname of the load balancer in your cluster

When you create a cluster, ROSA and OSD create a load balancer and generate a hostname for that load balancer. We need to know the load balancer hostname in order to create DNS records for our cluster.

You can find the hostname by running the `oc get svc` command against the `openshift-ingress` namespace. The hostname of the load balancer is the `EXTERNAL-IP` associated with the `router-default` service in the `openshift-ingress` namespace.

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get svc -n openshift-ingress
NAME            TYPE          CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP                                             PORT(S)                     AGE
router-default  LoadBalancer  172.30.237.88  a234gsr3242rsfsfs-1342r624.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com  80:31175/TCP,443:31554/TCP  76d
----

In our case, the hostname is `a234gsr3242rsfsfs-1342r624.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`.

Save this value for later, as we will need it to configure DNS records for our new component route hostnames.

== Add component route DNS records to your hosting provider

In your hosting provider, add DNS records that map the `CNAME` of your new component route hostnames to the load balancer hostname we found in the previous step.

== Update the component routes and TLS secret using the ROSA CLI

When your DNS records have been updated, you can use the ROSA CLI to change the component routes.

Use the `rosa edit ingress` command to update your default ingress route with the new base domain and the secret reference associated with it.

[source,bash]
----
$ rosa edit ingress -c <my-example-cluster-aws> r3l6 --cluster-routes-hostname="my-new-domain.dev" --cluster-routes-tls-secret-ref="component-tls"

ID    APPLICATION ROUTER                                             PRIVATE  DEFAULT  [...]  LB-TYPE  [...]  WILDCARD POLICY      NAMESPACE OWNERSHIP  HOSTNAME           TLS SECRET REF
r3l6  https://apps.my-example-cluster-aws.z9a9.p1.openshiftapps.com  yes      yes      [...]  nlb      [...]  WildcardsDisallowed  Strict               my-new-domain.dev  component-tls
----

Add your certificate to the trust store on your local system, then confirm that you can access your components at their new routes using your local web browser.
