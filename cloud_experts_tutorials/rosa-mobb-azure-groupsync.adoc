This guide focuses on how to synchronize Identity Provider (IDP) groups and users after configuring authentication in OpenShift Cluster Manager (OCM). For an IDP configuration example, please reference the link:https://mobb.ninja/docs/idp/azuread[Configure Azure AD as an OIDC identity provider for ROSA] guide.

To set up group synchronization from Azure Active Directory (AD) to ROSA, you must:

. Define groups and assign users in Azure AD
. Add the required API permissions to the app registration in Azure AD
. Install the Group Sync Operator from the OpenShift Operator Hub
. Create and configure a new Group Sync instance
. Set a synchronization schedule
. Test the synchronization process

== Define groups and assign users in Azure AD

[NOTE]
====
To synchronize groups and users with ROSA, they must exist in Azure AD.
====

. Create groups to synchronize with ROSA if they do not already exist:
+
image:az-ad-grp.png[Azure AD Groups]

. Create user IDs to synchronize with ROSA if they do not already exist:
+

. Assign newly created users to the appropriate group:

[id="rosa-mobb-azure-groupsync-add-api-permissions"]
== Add API Permissions to Azure AD App Registration

The GroupSync job requires permissions on the Azure AD tenant beyond those of the OIDC IdP. For it to work, add the following entries under the *API Permissions* menu item:

* `Group.Read.All`
* `GroupMember.Read.All`
* `User.Read.All`

These three permissions should all be `Application` rather than `Delegated` and this will require clicking on the *Grant admin consent* button above the permissions list. When done, the screen should look like this:

[id="rosa-mobb-azure-groupsync-install-operator"]
== Install the Group Sync Operator from the OpenShift Operator Hub

. In the OpenShift Operator Hub find the **Group Sync Operator**:
+
image:grp-sync-opr-hub.png[Group Sync in Operator Hub]

. Install the Operator in the `group-sync-operator` namespace:
+
image:grp-sync-opr-inst.png[Group Sync installation]

[id="rosa-mobb-azure-groupsync-configure-group-sync"]
== Create and configure a new Group Sync instance

. Create a new secret named `azure-group-sync` in the **group-sync-operator** namespace. For this you will need the following values:
+
** `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
** `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
** `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`

. Using the OpenShift CLI, create the secret using the following format:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create secret generic azure-group-sync \
    --from-literal=AZURE_TENANT_ID=<insert-id> \
    --from-literal=AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<insert-id> \
    --from-literal=AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<insert-secret>
----

. Create a new Group Sync instance in the `group-sync-operator` namespace:
+
image:grp-sync-instance.png[Group Sync instance]

. Select all the default YAML and replace is with a modified version of the example below, customizing the YAML to match the group names and save the configuration.

            - rosa_admin
            - rosa_project_owner

          prune: false
    schedule: '\* \* \* \* \*'

[id="rosa-mobb-azure-groupsync-schedule"]
== Set a synchronization schedule

The Group Sync Operator provides a cron-based scheduling parameter for specifying how often the groups and users should be synchronized. This can be set in the instance YAML file during initial configuration or at any time after.

The schedule setting of `schedule: \* \* \* \* \*` would result in synchronization occurring every minute. It also supports the cron "slash" notation (e.g., "*/5 \* \* \* \*", which would synchronize every five minutes).

[id="rosa-mobb-azure-groupsync-testing"]
== Testing the synchronization process

. Check to see if the Group Sync process has completed with a `Condition: ReconcileSuccess` message:
+
image:grp-sync-success.png[Successful Sync]

. Check to see that all the groups specified in the configuration YAML file show up in the ROSA Groups list:
+
image:grp-sync-success-grp.png[Groups added]

. Validate that all users specified in Azure AD also show up as members of the associated group in ROSA:
+
image:grp-sync-success-usr.png[Users added]

. Add a new user in Azure AD and assign it to the admin group:
+
image:grp-sync-new-usr.png[New User added]

. Verify that the user now appears in ROSA (after the specified synchronization time):
+
image:grp-sync-new-admin.png[New admin added]

. Now delete a user from the Azure AD admin group:
+
image:grp-sync-del-admin.png[Delete admin user]

. Verify the user has been deleted from the ROSA admin group:
+
image:grp-sync-verify-del-admin.png[Verify Delete admin user]

[id="rosa-mobb-azure-groupsync-bind-groups"]
== Binding groups to roles

The preceding steps provide a method to get group membership information into OpenShift, but the final step in translating that into user authorization control requires binding each group to a role or roles on the cluster. This can be done via the OCP web console by opening the Group detail, or by applying YAML via the CLI.

[id="rosa-mobb-azure-groupsync-considerations"]
## Additional considerations

. The `prune` key in the YAML controls how the sync handles groups that are removed from Azure AD. If they key isn't present, the default value is `false`, which means that if a group is removed from Azure AD, it will still persist in OpenShift. If it is set to `true`, removal of a group from Azure AD will also remove the corresponding OpenShift Group.

. If there is a need to have multiple GroupSync configurations against multiple providers, note that there is no "merge" functionality in the Operator when it comes to group membership. If a group named `ocp-admins` is present in two directories with sync jobs, they will effectively overwrite each other each time the sync job runs. It is recommended to name groups intended for use on OCP such that they indicate from which directory they originate (e.g., `azure-ocp-admins` or something like `contoso_ocp_admins` in the case of multiple Azure AD providers). Bind multiple groups with the same permissions needs to the same `Role` or `ClusterRole` as needed.
