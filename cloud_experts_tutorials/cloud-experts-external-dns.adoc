= Tutorial: Deploying the External DNS Operator on {product-title}

[role="_abstract"]
The External DNS Operator deploys and manages `ExternalDNS` to provide the name resolution for services and routes from the external DNS provider, like Amazon Route 53, to {product-title} clusters. In this tutorial, we will deploy and configure the External DNS Operator with a secondary ingress controller to manage DNS records in Amazon Route 53. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `External DNS` Operator does not support STS using IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) and uses long-lived Identity Access Management (IAM) credentials instead. This tutorial will be updated when the Operator supports STS.
