To log in to your cluster, set up an identity provider (IDP). This tutorial uses GitHub as an example IDP. See the full list of xref:../../rosa_install_access_delete_clusters/rosa-sts-config-identity-providers.adoc#understanding-idp-supported_rosa-sts-config-identity-providers[IDPs supported by ROSA].

* To view all IDP options, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
rosa create idp --help
----

== Setting up an IDP with GitHub
. Log in to your GitHub account.
. Create a new GitHub organization where you are an administrator.
+
[TIP]
====
If you are already an administrator in an existing organization and you want to use that organization, skip to step 9.
====
+
Click the *+* icon, then click *New Organization*.

. *Optional:* Enter the requested information on the following page.
. Click *Submit*.
. Go back to the terminal and enter the following command to set up the GitHub IDP:
+
[source,terminal]
----
rosa create idp --cluster=<cluster name> --interactive
----

. Enter the following values:
+
[source,terminal]
----
Type of identity provider: github
Identity Provider Name: <IDP-name>
Restrict to members of: organizations
GitHub organizations: <organization-account-name>

== Granting other users access to the cluster
To grant access to other cluster user you will need to add their GitHub user ID to the GitHub organization used for this cluster.

. In GitHub, go to the *Your organizations* page.

. Click your *profile icon*, then *Your organizations*. Then click *<your-organization-name>*.  In our example, it is `my-rosa-cluster`.
+

+

. Enter the GitHub ID of the new user, select the correct user, and click *Invite*.
. Once the new user accepts the invitation, they will be able to log in to the ROSA cluster using the console link and their GitHub credentials.
