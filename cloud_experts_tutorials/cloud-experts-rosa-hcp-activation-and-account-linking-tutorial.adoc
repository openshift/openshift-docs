[role="_abstract"]
This tutorial describes the process for activating {product-title} and linking to an AWS account, before deploying the first cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have received a private offer for the product, make sure to proceed according to the instructions provided with the private offer before following this tutorial. The private offer is designed either for a case when the product is already activated, which replaces an active subscription, or for first time activations.
====

== Prerequisites

* Log in to the Red{nbsp}Hat account that you want to associate with the AWS account that will activate the {product-title} product subscription.
* The AWS account used for service billing can only be associated with a single Red{nbsp}Hat account. Typically an AWS payer account is the one that is used to subscribe to {product-title} and used for account linking and billing.
* All team members belonging to the same Red{nbsp}Hat organization can use the linked AWS account for service billing while creating {product-title} clusters.
