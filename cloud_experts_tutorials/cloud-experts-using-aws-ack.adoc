link:https://aws-controllers-k8s.github.io/community/[AWS Controllers for Kubernetes] (ACK) lets you define and use AWS service resources directly from {product-title}. With ACK, you can take advantage of AWS-managed services for your applications without needing to define resources outside of the cluster or run services that provide supporting capabilities such as databases or message queues within the cluster.

You can install various ACK Operators directly from the software catalog. This makes it easy to get started and use the Operators with your applications. This controller is a component of the AWS Controller for Kubernetes project, which is currently in developer preview.

Use this tutorial to deploy the ACK S3 Operator. You can also adapt it for any other ACK Operator in the software catalog of your cluster.
