As an administrator of an {product-title} cluster, your account has additional
permissions and access to all user-created projects in your organization's
cluster. While logged in to an account with this role, the basic developer CLI
(the `oc` command) allows you increased visibility and management capabilities
over objects across projects, while the administrator CLI (commands under the
`oc adm` command) allow you to complete additional operations.

[NOTE]
====
While your account does have these increased permissions, the actual cluster
maintenance and host configuration is still performed by the OpenShift
Operations Team. If you would like to request a change to your cluster that you
cannot perform using the administrator CLI, open a support case on the
link:https://access.redhat.com/support/[Red Hat Customer Portal].
