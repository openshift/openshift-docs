Red Hat requests that application developers validate that any behavior they depend on is explicitly defined in the formal API documentation to prevent introducing dependencies on unspecified implementation-specific behavior or dependencies on bugs in a particular implementation of an API. For example, new releases of an ingress router may not be compatible with older releases if an application uses an undocumented API or relies on undefined behavior.
