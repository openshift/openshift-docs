== SecurityContextConstraints [security.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
+
--
SecurityContextConstraints governs the ability to make requests that affect the SecurityContext that will be applied to a container. For historical reasons SCC was exposed under the core Kubernetes API group. That exposure is deprecated and will be removed in a future release - users should instead use the security.openshift.io group to manage SecurityContextConstraints.
 Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).
