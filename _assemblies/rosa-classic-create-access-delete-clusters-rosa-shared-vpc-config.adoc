clusters in shared, centrally-managed AWS virtual private clouds (VPCs). 

[IMPORTANT]
====
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html[Sharing VPCs across multiple AWS accounts] is currently only supported for ROSA Classic clusters using STS for authentication.
====

[NOTE]
====
This process requires *two separate* AWS accounts that belong to the same AWS organization. One account functions as the VPC-owning AWS account (*VPC Owner*), while the other account creates the cluster in the cluster-creating AWS account (*Cluster Creator*).
