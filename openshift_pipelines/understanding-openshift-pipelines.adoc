{pipelines-title} is a cloud-native, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) solution based on Kubernetes resources. It uses Tekton building blocks to automate deployments across multiple platforms by abstracting away the underlying implementation details. Tekton introduces a number of standard Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for defining CI/CD pipelines that are portable across Kubernetes distributions.

== Key features

* {pipelines-title} is a serverless CI/CD system that runs Pipelines with all the required dependencies in isolated containers.
* {pipelines-title} are designed for decentralized teams that work on microservice-based architecture.
* {pipelines-title} use standard CI/CD pipeline definitions that are easy to extend and integrate with the existing Kubernetes tools, enabling you to scale on-demand.
* You can use {pipelines-title} to build images with Kubernetes tools such as Source-to-Image (S2I), Buildah, Buildpacks, and Kaniko that are portable across any Kubernetes platform.
* You can use the {product-title} Developer Console to create Tekton resources, view logs of Pipeline runs, and manage pipelines in your {product-title} namespaces.
