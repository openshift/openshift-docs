{op-title} is a cloud-native, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) solution based on Kubernetes resources. It uses link:https://tekton.dev[Tekton] building blocks to automate deployments across multiple platforms by abstracting away the underlying implementation details. Tekton introduces a number of standard link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/[Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)] for defining CI/CD pipelines that are portable across Kubernetes distributions.
