Most cartridges provide services by binding to ports. Cartridges must declare to which ports they bind, and provide variable names to describe: 


*  The IP addresses provided to the cartridge for binding. 


*  The local gear ports to which the cartridge services bind. 


*  The public proxy ports that expose local gear ports for communication between related gears in an application, such as the TCP proxy public endpoint. (Optional)


*  TCP endpoint mappings that establish a front end for application users. (Optional)

[[TCP_Endpoints]]


=== TCP Endpoints

TCP endpoints are services that are exposed by a cartridge, and are accessible by other cartridges or gears in an application. They may be any protocol which uses TCP, such as *http* or *mysql*. These services may also be exposed to application users through mappings. OpenShift only creates endpoint ports for scalable applications. 

The endpoints can be defined in the [variable]#Endpoints# section of the [filename]#$cartridge_name/metadata/manifest.yml# file. 

.Example Endpoints Entry
====

----
Endpoints:
  - Private-IP-Name:   <name of IP variable>
    Private-Port-Name: <name of port variable>
    Private-Port:      <port number>
    Public-Port-Name:  <name of public port variable>
    [variable]#Protocols#:         [<protocol type 1>,<protocol type 2>]
    [variable]#Mappings#:
      - Frontend:      '<frontend path>'
        Backend:       '<backend path>'
        Options:       { ... }
      - <...>
  - <...>

----


====

When a cartridge is installed on a gear, it automatically assigns IP addresses to each IP variable name ensuring that assigned addresses can bind to the specified port. 

If an endpoint specifies a public port variable, a public port proxy mapping is created using a random external port accessible through the gear's DNS entry. 

*Endpoint Environment Variables*

Endpoint values are exposed to cartridge scripts and application code through environment variables. These environment variables are formed from the [variable]#Cartridge-Short-Name# element and from the endpoint variable names specified in the [filename]#manifest.yml# file. 



.Example Environment Variable Format
====

----
OPENSHIFT_{Cartridge-Short-Name}_{name of IP variable}          => <assigned internal IP>
OPENSHIFT_{Cartridge-Short-Name}_{name of port variable}        => <endpoint specified port>
OPENSHIFT_{Cartridge-Short-Name}_{name of public port variable} => <assigned external port>

----


====

*Endpoint Protocols*

You can define the protocols for services using the [variable]#Protocols# variable. [variable]#Protocols# takes a comma-separated list of protocol types from the following available options: 



.Endpoint Protocols
[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===============
|Protocol|Description
						
|tcp|TCP
						
|http|HTTP
						
|https|HTTP Secure (HTTP over SSL/TLS)
						
|ws|WebSocket
						
|
							wss
						|
							WebSocket Secure (WebSocket over SSL/TLS)
						
|
							tls
						|
							SNI Proxy
						
|
							mongodb
						|
							MongoDB
						
|
							mysql
						|
							MySQL
						
|
							postgresql
						|
							PostgreSQL
						

|===============


If the [variable]#Protocols# list is not set, the default behavior matches the pre-[variable]#Protocols# behavior. For example, if an endpoint has [variable]#Mappings#, assume HTTP; otherwise, assume TCP. The front-end modules also translate [variable]#Mappings# options. For example, if a [variable]#Mappings# entry has [literal]#websocket# set in its [variable]#Options#, then [literal]#ws# is added to the [variable]#Protocols# list. 

*Endpoint Mappings*

If an endpoint specifies [variable]#Mappings#, a front-end httpd route to the cartridge is created for each mapping entry using the provided options. The Frontend key is a front-end path element connected to a back-end URI specified by the [variable]#Backend# key. The [variable]#Options# hash enables additional route configuration options. 



.Endpoint Mapping Options
[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===============
|Option|Description
						
|websocket|Enable WebSocket on a particular path
						
|
							gone
						|
							Mark the path as gone (URI is ignored)
						
|
							forbidden
						|
							Mark the path as forbidden (URI is ignored)
						
|
							noproxy
						|
							Mark the path as not proxied (URI is ignored)
						
|
							redirect
						|
							Use redirection to URI instead of proxy (URI must be a path)
						
|
							file
						|
							Ignore request and load file path contained in URI (must be a path)
						
|
							tohttps
						|
							Redirect request to HTTPS and use the path contained in the URI (must be a path)

=== TCP Endpoint Example

This section provides an example [variable]#Endpoints# entry in a [filename]#$cartridge_name/metadata/manifest.yml# file, and demonstrates how OpenShift uses this entry to create environment variables, public proxy port mappings, and *httpd* routes. 

.Example Endpoints Entry
====

----
Name: CustomCart
Cartridge-Short-Name: CUSTOMCART

Endpoints:
  - Private-IP-Name:   HTTP_IP

====

*Environment Variables*

Several environment variables are created for the cartridge using the information in the [variable]#Endpoints# entry. 



.Example Environment Variables
====

----
# Internal IP/port allocations
OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_HTTP_IP=<assigned internal IP 1>
OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_WEB_PORT=8080
OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_ADMIN_PORT=9000
OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_INTERNAL_SERVICE_IP=<assigned internal IP 2>
OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_INTERNAL_SERVICE_PORT=5544

# Public proxy port mappings
OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_WEB_PROXY_PORT=<assigned public port 1>
OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_ADMIN_PROXY_PORT=<assigned public port 2>
----


====

*Proxy Port Mapping*

Proxy port mapping is assigned using the information in the [variable]#Endpoints# entry. 



.Example Proxy Port Mapping
====

----
<assigned external IP>:<assigned public port 1> => OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_HTTP_IP:OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_WEB_PORT
<assigned external IP>:<assigned public port 2> => OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_HTTP_IP:OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_ADMIN_PORT
----


====

*httpd Routing*

The *httpd* routes are assigned using the [variable]#Endpoints# entry. 



.Example httpd Routing
====

----
http://<app dns>/web_front    => http://OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_HTTP_IP:8080/web_back
http://<app dns>/socket_front => http://OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_HTTP_IP:8080/socket_back
http://<app dns>/admin_front  => http://OPENSHIFT_CUSTOMCART_HTTP_IP:9000/admin_back

----


====

[[Custom_HTTP_Services1]]


=== Custom HTTP Services

With ERB templates you can expose cartridge services using an application's URL by placing the Apache configuration code in the [filename]#httpd.d# directory. 

After OpenShift runs the cartridge [filename]#setup# script, it processes each ERB template and writes the contents of the node's *httpd* configuration. 

.Example mongodb.conf.erb File
====

----
Alias /health <%= ENV['OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR'] + "/mongodb/httpd.d/health.html" %>
Alias / <%= ENV['OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR'] + "/mongodb/httpd.d/index.html" %>

[[Enabling_Custom_Paths_for_Websockets]]


=== Enabling Custom Paths for Websockets


Websockets are used to create real-time events initiated by an OpenShift application. 

The ability to add a custom path for websocket URLs to a cartridge must be enabled in that cartridge's _manifest.yml_ file before it can be used in a new application. Add the following information to the [filename]#/usr/libexec/openshift/cartridges/Cart_Name/metadata/manifest.yml# file of the desired cartridge: 

----
- Private-IP-Name: IP2
  Private-Port-Name: PORT2
  Private-Port: 8080
  Public-Port-Name: PROXY_PORT2
  [variable]#Protocols#:
  - http
  - ws
  [variable]#Mappings#: 
  - Frontend: '/file_path'
    Backend: '/file_path2'
    Options:
      websocket: true
----

This adds a second endpoint to a cartridge with [literal]#ws# listed in the protocols and websockets set to +true+. 

After a cartridge has been modified to use custom paths for websocket URLs, a new application can then be created with the modified cartridge. The application is accessible using the new endpoint, as shown in the following example:

----
ws://app-domain.example.com:8000/file_path
----
