Using _logshifter_ enables automatic log rotation and consolidation across cartridges in a gear. In OpenShift, cartridges can log to _Syslog_ using _logshifter_. For more information about _logshifter_, see the _logshifter_ [filename]#README# file. 

When writing a cartridge control script, it is typical to spawn a runtime process such as java or mongod. To take advantage of _logshifter_, redirect the standard out (STDOUT) and standard error (STEDRR) streams of the process to the [filename]#/usr/bin/logshifter# file. For example, for a Java-based cartridge.

.Redirecting Logs with Logshifter
====

----
:java ... |& /usr/bin/logshifter -tag my-cartridge &
----

====

Using this method, java is started in the background, and all output produced by the application is logged through _logshifter_. The [parameter]#-tag# argument must be a string unique to the cartridge.

*Tips for PID Management*

In the previous example, the standard pipe operator is used from a shell script to redirect logs from the cartridge process to _logshifter_. This works well for programs which are capable of managing a PID file internally. However, for cartridges which bootstrap a process and cannot manage a PID file by itself, using a simple pipe operator can be problematic. When piping programs using a shell, the programs are typically started in parallel, rendering the [variable]#$!# variable unreliable for determining the PID of the cartridge process. For these cases, setting up a named pipe can allow the cartridge to use _logshifter_ and also manage the PID of the process. The following example demonstrates the setup of a named pipe used by a Java cartridge which preserves the reliability of [variable]#$!# so the cartridge script can manage the PID file manually.

.Setting Up Named Pipe
====

----
LOGPIPE=${OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR}/app-root/runtime/logshifter-my-cartridge
rm -f $LOGPIPE && mkfifo $LOGPIPE

/usr/bin/logshifter -tag my-cartridge < $LOGPIPE &
java ... &> $LOGPIPE &
echo $! > $OPENSHIFT_MY_CARTRIDGE_DIR/my-cartridge.pid
----
====

Setting up the named pipe manually provides the most flexibility for managing both the _logshifter_ and cartridge processes.
