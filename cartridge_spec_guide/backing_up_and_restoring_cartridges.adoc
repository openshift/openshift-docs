OpenShift provides +snapshot+ and +restore+ features for user applications. These features enable OpenShift application developers to: 


*  Snapshot the current state of an application to create a backup. 
*  Restore an application from an archived state. 
*  Copy or rename an application by taking a snapshot, creating a new application, then restoring the snapshot data to the new application.

=== Snapshot

When an application developer runs the +rhc snapshot save+ command, OpenShift creates an archive of the application and performs the following steps: 


.  Stops the application by running the +gear stop+ command. 


.  Runs the +control pre-snapshot+ command for each cartridge on the gear. You can control cartridge serialization in the snapshot by implementing the +control pre-snapshot+ command in conjunction with exclusions. For example, you can snapshot to a database dump instead of a database file. 


.  Builds a list of exclusions from the [variable]#snapshot_exclusions## entry in the [filename]#$cartridge_name/metadata/managed_files.yml# file for each cartridge on the gear. 


.  Creates an archive of the application in [filename]#tar.gz# format and writes it to [literal]#stdout# for use by the client tools. In addition to the files listed in the [variable]#snapshot_exclusions# entry in the [filename]#managed_files.yml# file, OpenShift excludes the following files: 

*  Selected gear user files: [filename]#.tmp#, [filename]#.ssh#, [filename]#.sandbox#. 


*  Application state file: [filename]#app-root/runtime/.state#. 


*  Bash history file: [filename]#$OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR/.bash_history#. 


.  Runs the +control post-snapshot+ command for each cartridge on the gear. Use this script to cleanup after the snapshot runs. 


.  Will either stop or start the gear based on the state of the application before the snapshot. 

*Snapshot Exclusions*

Use the optional [variable]#snapshot_exclusions# entry in the [filename]#$cartridge_name/metadata/managed_files.yml# file to list files to exclude from the snapshot and restore process. File patterns originate from the [variable]#OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR# directory, not the cartridge directory. Do not exclude files that your cartridge requires to operate.

OpenShift uses the +tar+ command when performing snapshots. See the +tar+ man page +--exclude-from+ option for more information. 

[[Understanding_OpenShift_Enterprise_Behavior_Restore]]


=== Restore

When an application developer runs the +rhc snapshot restore+ command, OpenShift restores the application from an archive in the following steps: 


.  Prepares the application for restoration. 

*  If the archive contains a Git repository, OpenShift runs the +gear pre-receive+ command. 


*  If the archive does not contain a Git repository, OpenShift runs the +gear stop+ command. 


.  Runs the +control pre-restore+ command for each cartridge on the gear. This enables you to control the restoration of your cartridge, for example by deleting an old database dump. 


.  Builds a list of file name changes to apply during the restoration from the [variable]#restore_transforms## entry in the [filename]#$cartridge_name/metadata/managed_files.yml# file for each cartridge on the gear. 


.  Extracts the archive into the gear user's home directory, overwriting existing files and applying the file name changes listed in the [variable]#restore_transforms# entry in the [filename]#managed_files.yml# file. 


.  Runs the +control post-restore+ command for each cartridge on the gear. Use this script to load a database flat file into the running database. 


.  Resumes the application. 

*  If the archive contains a Git repository, OpenShift runs the +gear postreceive+ command. 
*  If the archive does not contain a Git repository, OpenShift runs the +gear start+ command. 

.  Will either stop or start the gear based on the state of the application before restoring. 

*Restoring with Transformed File Names*

Use the optional [variable]#restore_transforms# entry in the [filename]#$cartridge_name/metadata/managed_files.yml# file to provide scripts that transform file names when OpenShift restores an application. This entry enables you to restore older snapshots to a newer cartridge with file name changes.

restore_transforms:
- s|${OPENSHIFT_GEAR_NAME}/data|app-root/data|

OpenShift uses the +tar+ command when restoring a gear. See the +tar+ man page +--transform+ option for more information.
