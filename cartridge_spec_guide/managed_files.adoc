Managed files are files that have non-default settings, or that require special handling by OpenShift. 

The [filename]#$cartridge_name/metadata/managed_files.yml# file lists managed files and strings that OpenShift uses during different stages of the cartridge life cycle. 

*File Patterns*

Most entries in the [filename]#$managed_files.yml# file use file patterns. OpenShift treats these patterns like shell globs. Dir.glob processes entries that contain asterisk (*) symbols using the [parameter]#File::FNM_DOTMATCH# flag. It treats entries that end in a forward slash (/) as directories, and other entries as files. For more information on globs, see link:$$http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Dir.html#method-c-glob$$[]. 



Entries that begin with [filename]#~/# start at the gear directory. All other entries start at the cartridge directory. 

*Strings*

Some entries allow string values. These values return directly without any modification.
