The OpenShift runtime contains a system for upgrading custom cartridges on a gear to the latest available version and for applying gear-level changes that affect cartridges.

ifdef::openshift-online[]
The +oo-admin-upgrade+ command provides the command line interface for the upgrade system and can upgrade all the gears in an OpenShift environment, all the gears on a node, or a single gear. This command queries the OpenShift broker to determine the locations of the gears to migrate and uses MCollective calls to trigger the upgrade for a gear.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The +oo-admin-upgrade+ command on the broker host provides the command line interface for the upgrade system and can upgrade all the gears in an environment, all the gears on a node, or a single gear. This command queries the OpenShift broker to determine the locations of the gears to migrate and uses MCollective calls to trigger the upgrade for a gear.

*Upgrade Process Overview*

.  Load the gear upgrade extension, if configured. 


.  Inspect the gear state. 


.  Run the gear extension's _pre-upgrade_ script, if it exists. 


.  Compute the upgrade itinerary for the gear. 


.  If the itinerary contains an incompatible upgrade, stop the gear. 


.  Upgrade the cartridges in the gear according to the itinerary. 


.  Run the gear extension's _post-upgrade_ script, if it exists. 


.  If the itinerary contains an incompatible upgrade, restart and validate the gear. 


.  Clean up after the upgrade by deleting _pre-upgrade_ state and upgrade metadata.


[[Upgrade_Itinerary]]

=== Upgrade Itinerary

The upgrade process must be re-entrant; if it fails or times out, a subsequent upgrade operation must pick up where the last one left off. The upgrade itinerary stores information about which cartridges in a gear to upgrade and which type of upgrade to perform. 

There are two types of cartridge upgrade processes: compatible and incompatible. The [literal]#Compatible-Versions# element in a cartridge's [filename]#$cartridge_name/metadata/manifest.yml# file determines whether the new version is compatible with a previous version. The main difference between the compatible and incompatible upgrade processes is that an incompatible cartridge's gear stops during an upgrade, while a compatible cartridge's gear continues to run. 

*Upgrade Itinerary Configuration*

.  Read in the current [variable]#IDENT# of the cartridge. 


.  Determine the name and software version of the cartridge in the cartridge repository; this provides the manifest for the latest version of the cartridge. If a manifest does not exist in the cartridge repository or does not include the software version, skip the cartridge. 


.  If the latest manifest is for the same cartridge version as the version currently installed on the gear, skip the cartridge unless the [parameter]#ignore_cartridge_version# parameter is set. If the [parameter]#ignore_cartridge_version# parameter is set, record an incompatible upgrade for the cartridge in the itinerary. 


.  If the latest manifest includes the current cartridge version in the [literal]#Compatible-Versions# element, record a compatible upgrade for the cartridge in the itinerary. Otherwise, record an incompatible upgrade for the cartridge in the itinerary. 

[[Compatible_Upgrades]]


=== Compatible Upgrades

If the upgrade itinerary records a compatible upgrade for a cartridge, OpenShift uses the following process: 

*Compatible Upgrade Process*

.  Overlay the new version of the cartridge on the gear. 


.  Remove the files declared in the [literal]#Processed-Templates# element of the cartridge's [filename]#managed-files.yml#. 


.  Unlock the cartridge directory. 


.  Secure the cartridge directory. 


.  Run the cartridge's +upgrade+ script, if it exists. 


.  Lock the cartridge directory. 


[[Incompatible_Upgrades]]

=== Incompatible Upgrades


If the upgrade itinerary records an incompatible upgrade for a cartridge, OpenShift uses the following process: 

*Incompatible Upgrade Process*

.  Remove the files and directories declared in the [literal]#Setup-Rewritten# element of the cartridge's [filename]#managed_files.yml#. 


.  Overlay the new version of the cartridge on the gear. 


.  Unlock the cartridge directory. 


.  Secure the cartridge directory. 


.  Run the cartridge's +upgrade+ script, if it exists. 


.  Run the cartridge's +setup+ script. 


.  Process the cartridge's ERB templates. 


.  Lock the cartridge directory. 


.  Create new endpoints for the cartridge. 


.  Connect the frontend. 

[[Cartridge_Upgrade_Script]]


=== Cartridge Upgrade Script


You can provide a cartridge +upgrade+ script in the [filename]#$cartridge_name/bin/# directory to run during the upgrade process. The +upgrade+ script enables you to perform actions during the upgrade process that the compatible or incompatible processes do not perform. If you provide an +upgrade+ script, OpenShift passes it the following arguments: 


*  The software version of the cartridge. 


*  The current cartridge version. 


*  The cartridge version being upgraded to. 

A non-zero exit code from this script results in the upgrade operation failing.
