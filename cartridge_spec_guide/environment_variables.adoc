OpenShift uses environment variables to communicate information between cartridges, applications, and the system. 

OpenShift provides several system environment variables that are available for use at all cartridge entry points. 

Place cartridge environment variables in the [filename]#$cartridge_name/env/# directory. OpenShift loads cartridge variables after system environment variables, but before calling your code.

=== System Environment Variables

OpenShift provides several system environment variables. These variables are read-only. 

.System Environment Variables
[cols="4,7",options="header"]
|===============
|Name|Value
						
|
							HOME
						|
							Alias for [variable]#OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR#.
						
|
							HISTFILE
						|
							Bash history file.
						
|
							OPENSHIFT_APP_DNS
						|
							The fully qualified domain name of the application using your cartridge.
						
|
							OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME
						|
							The name of the application using your cartridge. Assigned by the application developer.
						
|
							OPENSHIFT_APP_UUID
						|
							The UUID of the application using your cartridge. Assigned by OpenShift.
						
|
							OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR
						|
							The directory where the application and your cartridge store data.
						
|
							OPENSHIFT_GEAR_DNS
						|
							The fully qualified domain name of the gear where your cartridge is installed. This may not be the same as [variable]#OPENSHIFT_APP_DNS#.
						
|
							OPENSHIFT_GEAR_NAME
						|
							The name of the gear where your cartridge is installed. Assigned by OpenShift. This may not be the same as [variable]#OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME#.
						
|
							OPENSHIFT_GEAR_UUID
						|
							The UUID of the gear where your cartridge is installed. Assigned by OpenShift.
						
|
							OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR
						|
							The home directory of the gear where your cartridge is installed. Assigned by OpenShift.
						
|
							OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR
						|
							The directory where the application repository is stored. OpenShift runs the application from this location.
						
|
							OPENSHIFT_TMP_DIR
						|
							The directory where the application and your cartridge store temporary data.
						
|
							TMP
						|
							Alias for [variable]#OPENSHIFT_TMP_DIR#.
						
|
							TMPDIR
						|
							Alias for [variable]#OPENSHIFT_TMP_DIR#.

=== Cartridge Environment Variables

OpenShift provides three environment variables for all cartridges by default. These variables are read-only. 

.Cartridge Environment Variables
[options="header"]
|===============
|	Name|Value
						
|
							OPENSHIFT_{Cartridge-Short-Name}_DIR
						|
							The directory where cartridge information is installed.
						
|
							OPENSHIFT_{Cartridge-Short-Name}_IDENT
						|
							The identity of the cartridge, sourced from its [filename]#manifest.yml# file. The format is *Cartridge-Vendor:Version:Cartridge-Version*.
						
|
							OPENSHIFT_PRIMARY_CARTRIDGE_DIR
						|
							The directory where the primary cartridge on a gear is installed. For example, a scaling PHP application has both a PHP cartridge and a HAProxy cartridge installed on the head gear. In this case, the PHP cartridge is the primary cartridge.

[[Examples_of_Cartridge_Variables]]


=== Custom Cartridge Environment Variables

You can add custom environment variables to a cartridge by adding them to the cartridge's [filename]#$cartridge_name/env/# directory or creating them with the cartridge's [filename]#setup# and [filename]#install# scripts. 

Entries in a cartridge's [filename]#$cartridge_name/env/# directory do not override system-provided environment variables. Using system-provided environment variable names in the [filename]#$cartridge_name/env/# directory prevents the cartridge from installing correctly. 

Prefix custom environment variables with [variable]#OPENSHIFT_{cartridge short name}# to prevent overwriting other cartridge variables in the packaged software's process environment space. 

Suffix directory environment variables with _DIR and the value with a backslash (/). 

You can provide Embedded Ruby (ERB) templates for environment variables in the [filename]#$cartridge_name/env/# directory. OpenShift processes ERB templates in this directory before calling the cartridge's [filename]#setup# script. 

OpenShift sets the PATH variable using the path [filename]#/etc/openshift/env/PATH3#. If you provide [variable]#OPENSHIFT_{Cartridge-Short-Name}_PATH_ELEMENT#, OpenShift uses the value to build the PATH when your scripts run or an application developer performs an interactive log on. 


[IMPORTANT]
====
OpenShift does not validate cartridge-provided environment variables. A cartridge can fail to function if its environment variable files contain invalid data. 


====


*Packaged Software Environment Variables*

If your cartridge packages software with its own environment variables, add these variables to the cartridge's [filename]#$cartridge_name/env/# directory or include them in the shim code of the scripts in the [filename]#$cartridge_name/bin/# directory.
