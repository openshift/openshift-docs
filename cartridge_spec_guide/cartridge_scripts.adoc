Cartridge scripts act as the application programming interface (API) for a cartridge. Use these scripts to contain the required code for single version software that configures easily. For complex configurations and software with multiple versions, use these scripts as shim code to set up the required environment and run additional scripts. You can also create symbolic links from these scripts. 

Cartridge scripts are located in the [filename]#$cartridge_name/bin/# directory, and run from the cartridge's home directory.

[[Embedded_Ruby_(ERB)_Processing]]

=== Embedded Ruby (ERB) Processing

Embedded Ruby (ERB) is a templating system that embeds Ruby into a text document. To provide more flexible configuration and environment variable options, OpenShift enables you to provide certain values as ERB templates. For more information on ERB templates, see the link:http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/erb/rdoc/ERB.html[ERB documentation at ruby-doc.org]. 

OpenShift renders ERB templates at +$$safe_level 2$$+ and processes them in two passes. For more information on Ruby safe levels, see the link:http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/taint.html[Programming Ruby documentation at ruby-doc.com]. 

.ERB Processing Passes

.  The first pass processes entries in the [filename]#$cartridge_name/env/# directory. This pass is mandatory, and occurs before OpenShift runs the [filename]#$cartridge_name/bin/setup# script. 


.  The second pass processes entries specified in the process_templates entry of the #$cartridge_name/metadata/managed_files.yml# file. This pass occurs after OpenShift runs the [filename]#$cartridge_name/bin/setup# script, but before it runs the [filename]#$cartridge_name/bin/install# script. This enables the [filename]#setup# script to create or modify ERB templates as required, and for the [filename]#install# script to use the processed values. 

.Example Environment Variable Template
====

ifdef::openshift-online[]
An [filename]#env/OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_LOG_DIR.erb# file contains: 

----
<%= ENV['OPENSHIFT_LOG_DIR'] %>
----

----
/var/lib/openshift/aa9e0f66e6451791f86904eef0939e/mongodb/log/
----
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
For OpenShift Enterprise release 2.0, an [filename]#env/OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_LOG_DIR.erb# file contains:

----
<% ENV['OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR'] + "/mongodb/log/" %>
----

For OpenShift Enterprise release 2.1 and later, an [filename]#env/OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_LOG_DIR.erb# file contains:

----
<%= ENV['OPENSHIFT_LOG_DIR'] %>
----

The value of [envar]#LOG_DIR# for each cartridge is set to the same value as [envar]#OPENSHIFT_LOG_DIR#.

endif::[]

From that ERB file, OpenShift creates an [envar]#env/OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_LOG_DIR# environment variable containing: 
====

.Example [filename]#php.ini# Configuration Template
====

A [filename]#conf/php.ini.erb# file contains:

----
upload_tmp_dir = "<%= "#{ENV['OPENSHIFT_PHP_DIR']}tmp/" %>"
session.save_path = "<%= "#{ENV['OPENSHIFT_PHP_DIR']}sessions/" %>"
----
			
From that ERB file, OpenShift creates a [filename]#conf/php.ini# file containing:

----
upload_tmp_dir = "/var/lib/openshift/aa9e0f66e6451791f86904eef0939e/php/tmp/"
session.save_path = "/var/lib/openshift/aa9e0f66e6451791f86904eef0939e/php/sessions/"
----


====

Other possible uses for ERB templates are +includes+ values in *httpd* configuration files, database configuration values for storing persistent data in the [filename]#OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR# directory, and the application name value in the [filename]#pom.xml# file. 

[[setup_script]]


=== setup Script

The [filename]#setup# script creates and configures files that OpenShift copies from the cartridge repository to the gear's directory. The [filename]#setup# script must be re-entrant. OpenShift runs the script for every upgrade that is not backward compatible. Add logic you want to run only once to the [filename]#install# script, not the [filename]#setup# script. 



Add files created during setup to the setup_rewritten section of the [filename]#$cartridge_name/metadata/managed_files.yml# file. During an upgrade, OpenShift deletes these files prior to running the [filename]#setup# script. 

If you use ERB templates to configure software, OpenShift processes these files for environment variable substitution after running the [filename]#setup# script. 

[cols="2,7,"]
|===============


|*Synopsis* |+setup [--version <version>]+

|*Options* |The +--version <version>+ option selects which version of the cartridge to install. If you do not supply a version, OpenShift installs the version given in the [variable]#Version# element of the [filename]#$cartridge_name/metadata/manifest.yml# file.
|*Lock context* | Unlocked
|===============


[[bininstall]]


=== install Script
The [filename]#install# script creates and configures files that OpenShift copies from the cartridge repository to the gear's directory. OpenShift runs the [filename]#install# script only on the first installation of a cartridge. 

Put logic for one-time operations, for example generating passwords, creating ssh keys, and adding environment variables, in the [filename]#install# script. 

Report client results and messages with the [filename]#install# script, not the [filename]#setup# script. 

The [filename]#install# script may substitute a version dependent of the _template_ or _template.git_ directories. 

[cols="2,7,"]
|===============


|*Synopsis* |+install [--version <version>]+

|*Options* |The +--version <version>+ option selects which version of the cartridge to install. If you do not supply a version, OpenShift installs the version given in the [variable]#Version# element of the [filename]#$cartridge_name/metadata/manifest.yml# file.
|*Lock context* | Unlocked
|===============


[[post-install_Script]]


=== post-install Script
The [filename]#post-install# script configures your cartridge after the cartridge starts. OpenShift only runs the [filename]#post-install# script for the first installation of the cartridge. 

[cols="2,7,"]
|===============


|*Synopsis* |+post-install [--version <version>]+

|*Options* |The +--version <version>+ option selects which version of the cartridge to install. If you do not supply a version, OpenShift installs the version given in the [variable]#Version# element of the [filename]#$cartridge_name/metadata/manifest.yml# file.
|*Lock context* | Unlocked
|===============

[[teardown_Script]]


=== teardown Script
The [filename]#teardown# script prepares the gear for cartridge removal. The script only runs when OpenShift removes the cartridge from a gear; it does not run when OpenShift deletes the gear. The gear continues to operate without the functionality of the removed cartridge. 

[cols="2,7,"]
|===============


|*Synopsis* |+teardown+

|*Lock context* | Unlocked
|===============


[[control_script]]


=== control Script
The [filename]#control# script enables OpenShift or the application developer to control the state of a cartridge and its packaged software. 

[cols="2,7,"]
|===============


|*Synopsis* |+control <action>+
|*Options* | The +<action>+ option is the action the cartridge performs.

|*Lock context* | Locked
|===============

.Control Script Actions
[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===============
|	Action|	Result
|	update-configuration, pre-build, build, deploy, post-deploy|	See link:openshift_build_process.html[OpenShift Build Process] for more information.
|	start|	Starts the software the cartridge controls.
|	stop|	Stops the software the cartridge controls.
|	status|	Returns a zero (0) exit status if the cartridge code is running.
|	reload|	Instructs the cartridge and its packaged software to reload their configuration information. This action only operates if the cartridge is running.
|	restart|	Stops the current process and starts a new one for the packaged software.
|	threaddump|	Signals the packaged software to perform a thread dump, if applicable.
|	tidy|	Releases unused resources.
|	pre-snapshot|	Prepares the cartridge for a snapshot.
|	post-snapshot|	Tidies the cartridge after a snapshot.
|	pre-restore|	Prepares the cartridge for restoration.
|	post-restore|	Tidies the cartridge after restoration.

|===============

*Using the tidy Action*

By default, the +tidy+ action performs the following operations:

*  Garbage collects the Git repository. 
*  Removes all files in the [filename]#/tmp# directory. 

Add additional operations to the +tidy+ action by editing the +tidy()+ function in the [filename]#$cartridge_name/bin/control# file. Because applications have limited resources, it is recommended that you tidy thoroughly. 

.Example of Additional +tidy+ Operations
====

----
rm $OPENSHIFT_{Cartridge-Short_Name}_DIR/logs/log.[0-9]
cd $OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR ; mvn clean
----
====

*Using the +status+ Action*

When the status of your packaged software is queried , use a zero (0) exit status to indicate correct operation. Direct information to an application developer using [literal]#stdout#. Return errors with a non-zero exit status using [literal]#stderr#. 



OpenShift maintains the expected state of an application in the [filename]#~/app-root/runtime/.state# file. Do not use this file to determine the status of the packaged software as it contains the expected state of the application, not the current state. 

.Values for [filename]#.state#
[cols="2,7",options="header"]
|===============
|	Value|	Status
|	building|	Application is building
|	deploying|	Application is deploying
|	idle|	Application is shutdown due to inactivity
|	new|	A gear exists, but no application is installed
|	started|	Application started
|	stopped|	Application is stopped

[[metrics Script]]

=== metrics Script

With the release of OpenShift Enterprise 2.1, a metrics entry can be added to the cartridge's [filename]#$cartridge_name/metadata/manifest.yml# file to inform OpenShift Enterprise that it supports metrics. 

.Metrics Entry
====

----
Metrics:
- enabled
----
====

The [filename]#metrics# script must be an executable file in the [filename]#$cartridge_name/bin/# directory. 

*Message Format*

A metrics message must include the following fields and be written to standard out (STDOUT): 

----
type=metric <metric name>=<metric value>
----

.Metrics Message Example
====

----
type=metric thread.count=5
----
====
endif::[]


[[Exit_Status_Codes]]


=== Exit Status Codes

OpenShift follows the convention that scripts return zero (0) for success and non-zero for failure. 

OpenShift supports special handling of several non-zero exit codes. These codes enable OpenShift to refine its behavior, for example when returning *HTTP* status codes through the REST API or when deciding whether to continue or abort an operation. 

If a cartridge script returns a value not included in the following tables, OpenShift treats the error as fatal to the cartridge.

[[Messaging_to_OpenShift_Enterprise_from_Cartridge]]


=== Communication Between OpenShift and Cartridges

A cartridge can provide services for use by multiple gears in one application. OpenShift enables you to publish these services. Each message writes to [literal]#stdout# or [literal]#stderr# with an exit status, one message per line. 

.Example Service Messages
