== Creating Template Directories for Language Cartridges

Use the [filename]#$cartridge_name/template/# or [filename]#$cartridge_name/template.git/# directory to provide a basic example of an application written in the language or framework your cartridge packages. Welcome the application developer to your cartridge and inform them that the cartridge is operating correctly. 

If you provide a [filename]#$cartridge_name/template.git/# directory, OpenShift copies the directory for the application developer. 

If you provide a [filename]#$cartridge_name/template/# directory, OpenShift uses it to create a Git repository for the application developer. Ensure that your +setup+ and +install+ scripts account for the path change from [filename]#template# to [filename]#template.git#. 

Create [filename]#.gitignore# files in empty directories to ensure the directories are retained when OpenShift builds the Git repository. 

.Example Ruby Template Directory
====

A Ruby 1.8 cartridge with Passenger support has a [filename]#template/public/# directory and a [filename]#config.ru# file to define the web application.

....
+- template
|  +- config.ru
|  +- public
|  |  +- .gitignore
|  .openshift
|  +- markers
|  |- ...
....

[[Marker_Files]]


=== Marker Files

The [filename]#$cartridge_name/template/.openshift/markers/# directory contains example marker files for application developers. These files set conditions for various stages of a cartridge's life cycle. You can add marker files as required to enable application developers to control aspects of your cartridge. 

.Example Ruby 1.8 Marker Files
====
|====
|Marker |Action
							
|force_clean_build |OpenShift removes previous output from the +bundle install --deployment+ command and reinstalls all gems according to the current [filename]#Gemfile# and [filename]#Gemfile.lock# files.
							
|hot_deploy |OpenShift serves new application code without restarting the application's web server.
							
|disable_auto_scaling |OpenShift does not automatically scale a scalable application.

[[Application_Developer_Action_Hooks1]]


=== Action Hooks

The [filename]#$cartridge_name/template/.openshift/action_hooks/# directory contains examples of application developer action hooks that run during the cartridge life cycle. 

.Example Action Hooks
====

....
pre_start_`cartridge name`
post_start_`cartridge name`
pre_stop_`cartridge name`
....
====

OpenShift runs default [filename]#action_hooks# as indicated in the +control+ script. To add additional hooks, run them explicitly in the +control+ script. Ensure appropriate documentation is available for application developers to use the additional hooks correctly. 

If you find that action hooks are not working, they may not be executable. To fix this, run the following command:

----
git update-index --chmod=+x .openshift/action_hooks/<file_name>
----

The +--chmod=$$(+ | -)$$x+ command sets the execute permissions on the updated file specified.
