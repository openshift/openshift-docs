When changes to an application's Git repository are pushed, OpenShift builds and deploys the application using the updated repository. The build and deploy process changes if the application is scaling or if it uses a builder cartridge. 

[[Default_Build_Lifecycle]]


=== Default Build Life Cycle

If no builder cartridge is present, OpenShift executes the default build life cycle when an application developer pushes changes to an application Git repository. The default life cycle consists of a +build+, +preparation+, +distribute+, and +deploy+ phase. 

In the default build life cycle, OpenShift manages the starting and stopping of the application, and moves the updated code into [filename]#$OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR#. The primary cartridge and application developer action hooks in [filename]#$OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR/.openshift/action_hooks# determine specific behaviors during this process. 

*Build Phase*

During the build phase, OpenShift:

.  Runs the +gear stop+ command to stop the application. 
.  Runs the +control pre-receive+ command on the primary cartridge. 
.  Runs the +control pre-repo-archive+ command on the primary cartridge. 
.  Creates a new application directory: [filename]#$OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR/app-deployments/$date_$time# and dependent subdirectories. 
+
[NOTE]
====
If your cartridge requires a particular directory structure for dependencies, create a symbolic link for your cartridge directory structure into [filename]#$OPENSHIFT_DEPENDENCIES_DIR#. Use [filename]#$OPENSHIFT_BUILD_DEPENDENCIES_DIR# for build time only dependencies. 
====

.  Copies [filename]#$OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR/app-root/runtime/dependencies# from the active application to [filename]#$OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR/app-deployments/$date_$time/dependencies#. 
.  Removes previous applications starting from the oldest until the number set at [filename]#$OPENSHIFT_KEEP_DEPLOYMENTS# is reached. 
.  Copies the new application source code to [filename]#$OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR#. This is the only point in the build life cycle when OpenShift copies the application source code. 
.  Runs the _control pre-build_ command on the primary cartridge. 
.  Runs the +pre-build+ user action hook, if present. 
.  Runs the +control build+ command on the primary cartridge. 
.  Runs the +build+ user action hook, if present.

*Preparation Phase*

During the preperation, OpenShift:

.  Runs the +prepare+ user action hook, if present. 
.  Calculates the application ID and checksum of the application contents. 
.  Creates [filename]#$OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR/app-deployments/by-id/$deployment_id# and points to [filename]#../app-deployments/$date_time# 

*Distribute Phase*

During the distribute phase, OpenShift synchronizes the new application with all child gears if the application is scalable. 

*Deploy Phase*

During the deploy phase, OpenShift:

.  Updates [filename]#$OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR/app-root/runtime/repo# so it points to [filename]#../../app-deployments/$date_$time/repo# 
.  Updates [filename]#$OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR/app-root/runtime/dependencies# so it points to [filename]#../../app-deployments/$date_$time/dependencies# 
.  Runs the +control update-configuration+ command on the primary cartridge. 
.  Starts all secondary cartridges in the application. 
.  Runs the +control deploy+ command on the primary cartridge. 
.  Runs the +deploy+ user action hook, if present. 
.  Starts the primary cartridge using the +gear start+ command. 
.  Runs the +control post-deploy+ command on the primary cartridge. 
.  Runs the +post-deploy+ user action hook, if present. 


[[Default_Scaling_Build_Lifecycle]]


=== Default Scaling Build Life Cycle

On the head gear, where the web proxy runs, the build phase for a scalable application is the same as the default build phase for a non-scaleable application. The deploy phase for a scalable applications is different.

*Deploy Phase*


.   OpenShift starts the secondary cartridges on the application's head gear. 


.   OpenShift runs the web proxy's +deploy+ hook on the head gear. 


.  The web proxy runs deployment steps on the application's secondary gears. For example, the default web proxy, HAProxy, preforms the following steps: 

.. It stops the secondary gears. 


..  It synchronizes the code and build artifacts from the head gear to the secondary gears. 


..  It runs the primary cartridge's +control update-configuration+ command on the secondary gears. 


..  It starts all the secondary cartridges on the secondary gears. 


..  It runs the primary cartridge's +control deploy+ command on the secondary gears. 


..  It runs the +deploy+ user action hook, if present, on the secondary gears. 


..  It starts the primary cartridge on the secondary gears. The application is now running on the secondary gears. 


..  It runs the primary cartridge's +control post-deploy+ command on the secondary gears. 


.. It runs the +post-deploy+ user action hook, if present, on the secondary gears. 


.   OpenShift runs the primary cartridge's +control deploy+ command on the head gear. 


.   OpenShift runs the +deploy+ user action hook, if present, on the head gear. 


.   OpenShift starts the primary cartridge on the head gear. 


.   OpenShift runs the primary cartridge's +control post-deploy+ command on the head gear. 


.   OpenShift runs the +post-deploy+ user action hook, if present, on the head gear. 

The build is now complete, and the scaleable application is running. 


[[Builder_Cartridge_Lifecycle]]

=== Builder Cartridge Life Cycle

If an application includes a builder cartridge, OpenShift does not perform build tasks. Instead, the builder cartridge runs the build process. 

During the Git +pre-receive+ hook, OpenShift runs the builder cartridge's +control pre-receive+ command. 

During the Git +post-receive+ hook, OpenShift runs the builder cartridge's +control post-receive+ command. 


[NOTE]
====
Build processes use the application developer's gear resources to run. When implementing a builder cartridge, do not copy source code or build artifacts more than necessary. 
====


[[Archiving_Applications]]

=== Archiving Applications

Current applications can be archived and re-deployed later. Archive an application with the following command: 

----
$ rhc archive-deployment
----


[[Binary_Deployment]]

=== Binary Deployment

Binary deployment is very similar to build and deploy without the build. Instead, the built artifacts and dependencies are provided and the deploy steps start at +prepare+. Enable binary deployment with the following command: 

----
$ rhc app configure <App_Name> --deployment-type binary
----
