[[Cartridge_Hierarchy]]


=== Cartridge Hierarchy

OpenShift cartridges use a hierarchy so that multiple cartridges can be collocated or combined on one gear. This hierarchy consists of a single, _primary_ cartridge, along with a combination of _embedded_ cartridges. The primary cartridge controls the application build life cycle, responds to scaling events, and provides external network accessibility. The embedded cartridges support the _primary_ cartridge and provide additional capabilities to applications. 

A good example of this hierarchy is the relationship between the _jenkins_ cartridge and the jenkins-client cartridge. While the _jenkins_ cartridge provides a fully functional browser based Jenkins service, the _jenkins-client_ cartridge is embedded in web applications to offload application builds to an existing Jenkins service. Note that the _jenkins-client_ cartridge by itself provides no value and must be combined with an existing _primary_ cartridge. 

[[Cartridge_Directory_Structure]]


=== Cartridge Directory Structure

The required directories of a cartridge must conform to a set structure or the cartridge can fail to function properly. You can add additional directories and files as needed to support the function of your cartridge. 


*   _Required_ files must exist for minimal OpenShift support of the cartridge. 


*   _Discretionary_ files are recommended, but not necessary. For example, [filename]#conf.d# is the standard file where a web framework installs its *httpd* configuration. 


*   _Optional_ files are not necessary. Use optional files to support additional cartridge functionality. 

.Cartridge Directory Structure
image::4411.png[Cartridge Directory Structure]

To support multiple software versions within one cartridge, create symbolic links between the [filename]#$cartridge_name/bin/control# file and the [filename]#$cartridge_name/versions/$software_version/bin/control# file. Alternatively, use the [filename]#$cartridge_name/bin/control# file as a shim to call the [filename]#control# file for the desired version. 

When creating an instance of your cartridge for use by a gear, OpenShift copies the files, links, and directories from the cartridge library, with the exception of the [filename]#$cartridge_name/usr/# directory. The [filename]#$cartridge_name/usr/# directory is symbolically linked to the gear's cartridge instance. This link enables all cartridge instances to share libraries and other data. 

See link:locking_cartridges.html[Locking Cartridges] for more information on customizing a cartridge instance. 

[[sect-Cartridge_Metadata_Elements]]


=== Cartridge Metadata Elements

OpenShift uses a [filename]#manifest.yml# file located in the [filename]#$cartridge_name/metadata/# directory to determine the features a cartridge requires. OpenShift also uses data from the [filename]#manifest.yml# file to provide information about the cartridge to users.

[[Cartridge-Short-Name_Element1]]


==== Cartridge-Short-Name

OpenShift creates several environment variables when installing a cartridge. The [variable]#Cartridge-Short-Name# element forms part of these environment variable names. 

.Example Cartridge-Short-Name Entry for a PHP cartridge
====

----
Cartridge-Short-Name: PHP
----

Environment variables use *PHP* in their name:

----				
OPENSHIFT_PHP_DIR
OPENSHIFT_PHP_IP
OPENSHIFT_PHP_PORT
OPENSHIFT_PHP_PROXY_PORT
----

====

[[Cartridge-Version_Element]]


==== Cartridge-Version

The [variable]#Cartridge-Version# element identifies the release version of a cartridge. The value uses the format: 

----
<number>[.<number>[.<number>[...]]]
----

For example:

----
Cartridge-Version: '1.0.3'
----

When you publish a new version of a cartridge, OpenShift uses the [variable]#Cartridge-Version# value to determine upgrade requirements for applications that use the cartridge. YAML treats [variable]#number.number# as a float but OpenShift requires a string for this value, so the value must be enclosed in single quotes ('). 

[[Compatible-Versions_Element]]


==== Compatible-Versions

The [variable]#Compatible-Versions# element is a list of previous cartridge versions that are compatible with the current cartridge version. 

.Example Compatible-Versions Entry
====

----
Compatible-Versions: ['1.0.1']
----

====

To be compatible with a previous version, the code changes in the current cartridge version must not require a restart of the cartridge or of an application using the cartridge. 

If the previous cartridge version is not in the [variable]#Compatible-Versions# list when you update the cartridge to a new version, OpenShift stops the cartridge, installs the new code, runs +setup+, and restarts the cartridge. This process results in a short amount of downtime for applications that use the cartridge. 

[[Cartridge-Vendor]]


==== Cartridge-Vendor

The [variable]#Cartridge-Vendor# element identifies the creator of a cartridge. OpenShift uses this value to differentiate between similar cartridges installed on the system. You can use a company name or an individual identifier for this value.

[[sect-Categories]]


==== Categories

The [variable]#Categories# element is a list of classifications for a particular cartridge, and contains two distinct groups:

* _system_ categories
* _descriptive_ categories

===== System Categories

The _system_ categories are special to the platform and influence the system behavior, and contain subcategories that are described in the following table.

.Subcategories of _system_ categories
[cols="2,7",options="header"]
|===========
|Subcategory |Description
|web_framework |Describes cartridges that accept inbound HTTP, HTTPS, and WebSocket requests. SSL termination occurs at the platform layer before cartridge interaction. The original inbound protocol is passed to the cartridge using the [literal]#X-Forwarded-Proto# header. An application can have one cartridge from the _web_framework_ category.

|web_proxy| Describes cartridges that route web traffic to the application's gears. When a scalable application is created with a cartridge from the _web_framework_ category, a _web_proxy_ cartridge is automatically added to enable the auto scaling feature. Therefore, when a _web_framework_ cartridge has to scale beyond a single gear, the _web_proxy_ cartridge automatically routes to the endpoint defined by the [literal]#Public-Port-Name# with the [parameter]#PROXY_PORT# value. The _web_proxy_ cartridge is automatically updated over HTTP with routing rules of the new gears as they are added. An application can have one cartridge from the _web_proxy_ category.

|service |Describes add-on cartridges that are not based on HTTP, such as MySQL. The _service_ category cartridges can scale independently, but may not be addressable outside of the platform. Therefore, OpenShift applications must have at least one _web_framework_ category cartridge so that the application's DNS registration contains at least one addressable HTTP endpoint. However, most applications consist of a _web_framework_ category cartridge and other cartridges from the service category. Therefore, using the _service_ category to classify a cartridge, such as MySQL, installs the cartridge on a separate gear from that of the _web_framework_ cartridge. This allows both cartridges to scale independently.

|plugin| This is similar to the _embedded_ category, but for scalable applications. It describes cartridges that can be collocated with other cartridges in scalable applications. The _plugin_ category uses defined [literal]#Group-Overrides# to determine the collocation between cartridges. For example, the [literal]#Group-Overrides# can specify that a Cron cartridge must be collocated with the _web_framework_ category cartridge.

|embedded| Describes cartridges that are always collocated or installed with any other _primary_ cartridge in non-scalable applications. For example, the Jenkins client cartridge can be combined with any web application cartridge to offload the builds to a Jenkins service.

|plug-in| This is similar to the _embedded_ category, but for scalable applications. It describes cartridges that can be collocated with other cartridges in scalable applications. The _plugin_ category uses defined [literal]#Group-Overrides# to determine the collocation between cartridges. For example, the [literal]#Group-Overrides# can specify that a Cron cartridge must be collocated with the _web_framework_ category cartridge. 

|domain_scope| Describes cartridges that can only have a single instance within a domain. For example, the Jenkins server cartridge contains the _domain_scope_ category to ensure that there is only one Jenkins server application within an entire domain. The Jenkins client cartridge is embedded in all other applications to enable builds that are handled by the Jenkins server. 
|===========


[[Descriptive_Categories]]


===== Descriptive Categories

The _descriptive_ categories are arbitrary classifications that improve the searching of cartridges in the Management Console and the client tools to improve the overall user experience. In the Management Console, the _descriptive_ categories are used as tags that allow users to search and filter the available cartridges. 

When using the client tools, the _descriptive_ categories are used to apply matching logic to cartridge operations. For example, if a user runs the +rhc add-cartridge php+ command, the _descriptive_ categories are searched along with the names of the cartridges. 

[[Group-Overrides]]


==== Group-Overrides

By default, each cartridge in a scalable application resides on its own gear within its own group instance. [variable]#Group-Overrides# can be used when you wish to have two cartridges located on the same set of gears. For example, if you create a Cron cartridge and wish to collocate that with a _web_framework_ category cartridge, you can do so as shown in the following example.  

.Example Group-Overrides with Cron and web_framework Cartridges
====

----
Group-Overrides:
- components:
  - web_framework
  - cron	
----
====

 

In cases where you wish to collocate a _web_framework_ category cartridge with a _web_proxy_ category cartridge, you can do so as shown in the following example.

.Example Group-Overrides with web_framework and web_proxy Cartridges
====

----
Group-Overrides:
- components:
  - web_proxy
  - web_framework
----

[[Scaling]]

==== Scaling

When a cartridge is added to a scalable application, the [parameter]#Min# and [parameter]#Max# parameters define the scaling limits for that cartridge. If both the [parameter]#Min# and [parameter]#Max# values are set to 1, this means that the cartridge cannot scale. If the [parameter]#Max# value is set to -1, the cartridge can scale up to the user's maximum gear limit. These limits are applicable for both automatic and manual scaling of cartridges. 

Note that when using [variable]#Group-Overrides# to collocate two or more scalable cartridges, the scaling limits of both cartridges must match. However, there may be cases where this limitation may not be ideal; for example, a _web_proxy_ category cartridge collocated with a _web_framework_ category cartridge. In such a case, it is not recommended to have the _web_proxy_ cartridge be located on every gear that holds the _web_framework_ cartridge. The [parameter]#Multiplier# parameter allows you to place a cartridge only on certain gears within a group instance, rather than all of them. For example, if the [parameter]#Multiplier# is set to 3, every third gear within the group instance gets the cartridge installed on it. If it is set to 1, then the cartridge gets installed on all gears within the group instance. 

[[Source-Url_Element]]

==== Source-Url

The [variable]#Source-Url# element is the location from which OpenShift downloads cartridge files during application creation.
