Cause (if it has been identified) - Why did this happen?
Workaround (If there is one)- What can you do to avoid or negate the effects of this issue in the meantime?  Sometimes if there is no workaround it is worthwhile telling readers to contact support for advice.  Never promise future fixes.
Result - If the workaround does not completely address the problem.

These known issues or limitations exist in {ProductName} at this time:

* {ProductName} does not support multitenancy.

* The istio-init container requires a privileged security context or at least to run as root and to have the NET_ADMIN capability.  The istio-init container needs to be privileged because it needs to properly setup the iptables rules in the pod so to properly intercept network connections.  The team is currently investigating ideas for ways to reduce the privileges required by Istio.

NOTE: *While Kafka publisher is included in the release as part of Jaeger, it is not supported.*

After eating an extra garlic pizza, Chris has bad breath and nobody wants to work closely with them.  As a workaround, Chris can take a breath mint, or avoid ordering extra garlic on their pizza.
