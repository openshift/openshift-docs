Consequence - What user action or situation would make this problem appear (Selecting the Foo option with the Bar version 1.3 plugin enabled results in an error message)?  What did the customer experience as a result of the issue? What was the symptom?
Cause (if it has been identified) - Why did this happen?
Workaround (If there is one)- What can you do to avoid or negate the effects of this issue in the meantime?  Sometimes if there is no workaround it is worthwhile telling readers to contact support for advice.  Never promise future fixes.
Result - If the workaround does not completely address the problem.

After eating an extra garlic pizza, Chris has bad breath and nobody wants to work closely with them.  As a workaround, Chris can take a breath mint, or avoid ordering extra garlic on their pizza.

These limitations exist in {ProductName} at this time:

* {ProductName} does not support IPv6, as it it not supported by the upstream Istio project, nor fully supported by OpenShift.
////
https://github.com/istio/old_issues_repo/issues/115
////
* The istio-init container requires a privileged security context or at least to run as root and to have the NET_ADMIN capability. The istio-init container needs to be privileged because it needs to properly configure the iptables rules in the pod to intercept network connections.  The team is currently investigating ideas for ways to reduce the privileges required by Istio.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Istio CNI plugin allows a pod to join the service mesh without requiring additional privileges to be granted for each pod. To enable the plugin, edit the control plane custom resource file
to set the *enabled* field in the *istio_cni* section to `true`.
====
+
* Graph layout - The layout for the Kiali graph can render differently, depending on your application architecture and the data to display (number of graph nodes and their interactions).  Because it is difficult if not impossible to create a single layout that renders nicely for every situation, Kiali offers a choice of several different layouts.  To choose a different layout, you can choose a different *Layout Schema* from the *Graph Settings* menu.

[NOTE]
====
While Kafka publisher is included in the release as part of Jaeger, it is not supported.

== {ProductName} Issues

These are the known issues in {ProductName} at this time:

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-684[MAISTRA-684] The default Jaeger version in the `istio-operator` is 1.12.0, which does not match Jaeger version 1.13.1 that shipped in {ProductName} {ProductVersion}.
+
If you install {ProductName} {ProductVersion} without changing the Jaeger version to 1.13.1, this is what you see when you check the pods in `istio-system`:

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-622[MAISTRA-622] In Maistra 0.12.0/TP12, permissive mode does not work. The user has the option to use Plain text mode or Mutual TLS mode, but not permissive.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-572[MAISTRA-572] Jaeger cannot be used with Kiali. In this release Jaeger is configured to use the OAuth proxy, but is also only configured to work through a browser and doesn't allow service access.  Kiali cannot properly communicate with the Jaeger endpoint and it considers Jaeger to be disabled.  See also https://issues.jboss.org/browse/TRACING-591[TRACING-591].

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-465[MAISTRA-465] The Maistra operator fails to create a service for operator metrics.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-453[MAISTRA-453] If you create a new project and deploy pods immediately, sidecar injection does not occur. The operator fails to add the `maistra.io/member-of` before the pods are created, therefore the pods must be deleted and recreated for sidecar injection to occur.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-357[MAISTRA-357] In OpenShift 4 Beta on AWS, it is not possible, out of the box, to access a TCP or HTTPS service through the ingress gateway on a port other than port 80. The AWS load balancer has a health check that verifies if port 80 on the service endpoint is active.
+
The load balancer health check only checks the first port defined in the Istio ingress gateway ports list. This port is configured as 80/HTTP:31380/TCP. Without a service running on this port, the load balancer health check fails.
+
To check HTTPS or TCP traffic by using an ingress gateway, you must have an existing HTTP service, for example, the Bookinfo sample application product page running on the ingress gateway port 80. Alternatively, using the AWS EC2 console, you can change the port that the load balancer uses to perform the health check, and replace 80 with the port your service actually uses.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-348[MAISTRA-348] To access a TCP service by using the ingress gateway on a port other than 80 or 443, use the service hostname provided by the AWS load balancer rather than the OpenShift router.
+
The istio-ingressgateway route hostname (for example, `istio-ingressgateway-istio-system.apps.[cluster name].openshift.com`) works with port 80 or port 443 traffic. However, that route hostname does not support other port traffic.
+
To access service(s) running on the ingress gateway TCP port(s), you can retrieve the istio-ingressgateway external hostname (for example,
`[uuid].[aws region].elb.amazonaws.com`) and then check traffic by using that external hostname value.
+
To retrieve the external IP hostname value, issue this command:
+
----
$ oc -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}'
----

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-193[MAISTRA-193] Unexpected console info messages are visible when health checking is enabled for citadel.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-158[MAISTRA-158] Applying multiple gateways referencing the same hostname will cause all gateways to stop functioning.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-108[MAISTRA-108] Part of the process to install Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) in an {product-title} cluster is to run the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/installing-operator-framework.html#installing-olm-using-ansible_installing-operator-framework[registry authorization playbook], but an error prevents the process from completing successfully.
+
The task "openshift_control_plane : Check for file paths outside of /etc/origin/master in master's config" fails because if finds "/dev/null" string within the master-config.yaml file. This string is added when we patch the configuration when preparing the cluster to install Istio.
+
Here are the two webhooks:

----
+
Create a soft link from `/var/lib/origin/null` to `/dev/null` and replace the two kubeConfigFile variables to `/var/lib/origin/null`. This makes the task think /var/lib/origin/null is an asset in the origin "perimeter" and continue running.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-62[MAISTRA-62] After a successful Istio installation, when upgrading an OCP cluster from 3.10 to 3.11, the storage upgrade task fails causing the entire upgrade process to fail.

== Kiali Issues

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-3118[KIALI-3118] After changes to the ServiceMeshMemberRoll, for example adding or removing namespaces, the Kiali pod restarts and then displays errors on the Graph page while the Kiali pod is restarting.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-3096[KIALI-3096] Runtime metrics fail in {ProductShortName}. There is an oauth filter between the {ProductShortname} and Prometheus, requiring a bearer token to be passed to Prometheus before access will be granted.  Kiali has been updated to use this token when communicating to the Prometheus server, but the application metrics are currently failing with 403 errors.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-2206[KIALI-2206] When you are accessing the Kiali console for the first time, and there is no cached browser data for Kiali, the “View in Grafana” link on the Metrics tab of the Kiali Service Details page redirects to the wrong location. The only way you would encounter this issue is if you are accessing Kiali for the first time.

* https://github.com/kiali/kiali/issues/507[KIALI-507] Kiali does not support Internet Explorer 11. This is because the underlying frameworks do not support Internet Explorer. To access the Kiali console, use one of the two most recent versions of the Chrome, Edge, Firefox or Safari browser.
