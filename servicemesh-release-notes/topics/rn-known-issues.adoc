After eating an extra garlic pizza, Chris has bad breath and nobody wants to work closely with them.  As a workaround, Chris can take a breath mint, or avoid ordering extra garlic on their pizza.

* The istio-init container requires a privileged security context or at least to run as root and to have the NET_ADMIN capability.  The istio-init container needs to be privileged because it needs to properly configure the iptables rules in the pod to intercept network connections.  The team is currently investigating ideas for ways to reduce the privileges required by Istio.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-110[MAISTRA-110] In large clusters, citadel can take a significant amount of time to create secrets. This may cause the installation to fail.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-157[MAISTRA-157] The conditional rate limiting feature does not restrict access as expected.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-158[MAISTRA-158] Applying multiple gateways referencing the same hostname will cause all gateways to stop functioning.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-193[MAISTRA-193] Unexpected console info messages are visible when health checking is enabled for citadel.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-108[MAISTRA-108] Part of the process to install Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) in an {product-title} cluster is to run the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/installing-operator-framework.html#installing-olm-using-ansible_installing-operator-framework[registry authorization playbook], but an error prevents the process from completing successfully.

The task "openshift_control_plane : Check for file paths outside of /etc/origin/master in master's config" fails because if finds "/dev/null" string within the master-config.yaml file. This string is added when we patch the configuration when preparing the cluster to install Istio.

Here are the two webhooks:

ValidatingAdmissionWebhook:

Create a soft link from `/var/lib/origin/null` to `/dev/null` and replace the two kubeConfigFile variables to `/var/lib/origin/null`. This makes the task think /var/lib/origin/null is an asset in the origin "perimiter" and continue running.


https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-62[MAISTRA-62] After a successful Istio installation, when upgrading an OCP cluster from 3.10 to 3.11, the storage upgrade task fails causing the entire upgrade process to fail.

https://github.com/kiali/kiali/issues/507[KIALI-507] Kiali does not support Internet Explorer 11. This is because the underlying frameworks do not support Internet Explorer. To access the Kiali console, use one of the two most recent versions of the Chrome, Edge, Firefox or Safari browser.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-2206[KIALI-2206] When you are accessing the Kiali console for the first time, and there is no cached browser data for Kiali, the “View in Grafana” link on the Metrics tab of the Kiali Service Details page redirects to the wrong location. The only way you would encounter this issue is if you are accessing Kiali for the first time.
