[NOTE]
====
If you are looking for a comprehensive getting started guide for ROSA, see xref:../rosa_getting_started/rosa-getting-started.adoc#rosa-getting-started[Comprehensive guide to getting started with {product-title}]. For additional information on ROSA installation, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/products/interactive-walkthrough/install-rosa[Installing Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) interactive walkthrough].
====

Follow this guide to quickly create a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster using the {cluster-manager-first} {hybrid-console-second}, grant user access, deploy your first application, and learn how to revoke user access and delete your cluster.

The procedures in this document enable you to create a cluster that uses AWS Security Token Service (STS). For more information about using AWS STS with ROSA clusters, see xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa-understanding.adoc#rosa-understanding-aws-sts_rosa-understanding[Using the AWS Security Token Service].

== Creating a ROSA cluster with AWS STS using the default auto mode

The procedures in this document use the `auto` modes in the {cluster-manager} {hybrid-console-second} to immediately create the required Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources using the current AWS account. The required resources include the account-wide IAM roles and policies, cluster-specific Operator roles and policies, and OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider.

//This content is pulled from rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-quickly-ocm.adoc
When using the {cluster-manager} {hybrid-console-second} to create a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster that uses the STS, you can select the default options to create the cluster quickly.

Before you can use the {cluster-manager} {hybrid-console-second} to deploy ROSA with STS clusters, you must associate your AWS account with your Red Hat organization and create the required account-wide STS roles and policies.
