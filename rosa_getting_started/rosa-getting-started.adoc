Follow this getting started document to create a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster, grant user access, deploy your first application, and learn how to revoke user access and delete your cluster.

You can create a ROSA cluster either with or without the AWS Security Token Service (STS). The procedures in this document enable you to create a cluster that uses AWS STS. For more information about using AWS STS with ROSA clusters, see xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa-understanding.adoc#rosa-understanding-aws-sts_rosa-understanding[Using the AWS Security Token Service].

== Prerequisites

* You reviewed the xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa-understanding.adoc#rosa-understanding[introduction to {product-title} (ROSA)], and the documentation on ROSA xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa_architecture_sub/rosa-architecture-models.adoc#rosa-architecture-models[architecture models] and xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa_architecture_sub/rosa-basic-architecture-concepts.adoc#rosa-basic-architecture-concepts[architecture concepts].

* You have read the documentation on xref:../rosa_planning/rosa-limits-scalability.adoc#rosa-limits-scalability[limits and scalability] and the xref:../rosa_planning/rosa-planning-environment.adoc#rosa-planning-environment[guidelines for planning your environment].

* You have reviewed the detailed xref:../rosa_planning/rosa-sts-aws-prereqs.adoc#rosa-sts-aws-prereqs[AWS prerequisites for ROSA with STS].

== Creating a ROSA cluster with STS

Choose from one of the following methods to deploy a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster that uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS). In each scenario, you can deploy your cluster by using {cluster-manager-first} or the ROSA CLI (`rosa`):

* xref:../rosa_install_access_delete_clusters/rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-quickly.adoc#rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-quickly[*Creating a ROSA cluster with STS using the default options*]: You can create a ROSA cluster with STS quickly by using the default options and automatic STS resource creation.

* xref:../rosa_install_access_delete_clusters/rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-with-customizations.adoc#rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-with-customizations[*Creating a ROSA cluster with STS using customizations*]: You can create a ROSA cluster with STS using customizations. You can also choose between the `auto` and `manual` modes when creating the required STS resources.
