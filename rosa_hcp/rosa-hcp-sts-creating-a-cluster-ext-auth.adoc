= Creating ROSA with HCP clusters with external authentication
include::_attributes/attributes-openshift-dedicated.adoc[]
:context: rosa-hcp-sts-creating-a-cluster-ext-auth

toc::[]

You can create {hcp-title-first} clusters that use external authentication to issue your access tokens.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Since it is not possible to upgrade or convert existing ROSA clusters to a {hcp} architecture, you must create a new cluster to use {hcp-title} functionality. You also cannot convert a cluster that was created to use external authentication providers to use the internal OAuth2 server. You must also create a new cluster.

[NOTE]
====
{hcp-title} clusters only support {sts-first} authentication.
