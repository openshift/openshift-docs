.Next steps

Before you can use the {cluster-manager} {hybrid-console-second} to deploy ROSA clusters, you must associate your AWS account with your Red{nbsp}Hat organization and create the required account-wide STS roles and policies.

== Creating a Virtual Private Cloud for your {hcp-title} clusters

You must have a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to create {hcp-title} cluster. You can use the following methods to create a VPC:

* Create a VPC by using a Terraform template
* Manually create the VPC resources in the AWS console

[NOTE]
====
The Terraform instructions are for testing and demonstration purposes. Your own installation requires some modifications to the VPC for your own use. You should also ensure that when you use this Terraform script it is in the same region that you intend to install your cluster. In these examples, use `us-east-2`.
