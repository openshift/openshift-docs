= Configuring a shared VPC for {product-title} clusters
include::_attributes/attributes-openshift-dedicated.adoc[]
:context: rosa-shared-vpc-config

toc::[]

You can create {product-title} clusters in shared, centrally-managed AWS virtual private clouds (VPCs).

include::snippets/install-cluster-in-vpc.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
* This process requires *two separate* AWS accounts that belong to the same AWS organization. One account functions as the VPC-owning AWS account (*VPC Owner*), while the other account creates the cluster in the cluster-creating AWS account (*Cluster Creator*).

* Installing a cluster in a shared VPC is supported only for OpenShift 4.17.9 and later.

*{sp}The hosted zones can be created in either the centrally-managed VPC account or in the workload account in which the cluster is deployed.

[NOTE]
====
Only certain cluster-to-VPC relationships are supported. Multiple  {product-title} clusters in a single VPC are not supported. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6980058[Multiple {product-title} clusters in a single VPC]
