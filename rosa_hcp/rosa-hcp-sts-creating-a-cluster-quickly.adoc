= Creating {product-title} clusters using the default options

toc::[]

{product-title} offers a more efficient and reliable architecture for creating {product-title} clusters. With {product-title}, each cluster has a dedicated control plane that is isolated in the ROSA service AWS account.

Create a {product-title} cluster quickly by using the default options and automatic AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resource creation. You can deploy your cluster by using the ROSA CLI (`rosa`).

[IMPORTANT]
====
Since it is not possible to upgrade or convert existing {rosa-classic-title} clusters to hosted control plane architecture, you must create a new cluster to use {product-title} functionality.
====

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} clusters only support AWS IAM Security Token Service (STS) authentication.

=== Considerations regarding auto creation mode

The procedures in this document use the `auto` mode in the ROSA CLI to immediately create the required IAM resources using the current AWS account. The required resources include the account-wide IAM roles and policies, cluster-specific Operator roles and policies, and OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider.

Alternatively, you can use `manual` mode, which outputs the `aws` commands needed to create the IAM resources instead of deploying them automatically.

== {product-title} Prerequisites

To create a {product-title} cluster, you must have the following items:

* A configured virtual private cloud (VPC)
* Account-wide roles
* An OIDC configuration
* Operator roles

[id="rosa-hcp-creating-vpc"]
=== Creating a Virtual Private Cloud for your {product-title} clusters

You must have a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to create {product-title} cluster. You can use the following methods to create a VPC:

* Create a VPC using the ROSA CLI
* Create a VPC by using a Terraform template
* Manually create the VPC resources in the AWS console

[NOTE]
====
The Terraform instructions are for testing and demonstration purposes. Your own installation requires some modifications to the VPC for your own use. You should also ensure that when you use this Terraform configuration, it is in the same region that you intend to install your cluster. In these examples, `us-east-2` is used.
