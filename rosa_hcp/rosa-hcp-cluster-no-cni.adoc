You can use your own Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin when creating a {product-title} cluster. You can create a {product-title} cluster without a CNI and install your own CNI plugin after cluster creation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For customers who choose to use their own CNI, the responsibility of CNI plugin support belongs to the customer in coordination with their chosen CNI vendor.

//The default plugin for {product-title} is the xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/about-ovn-kubernetes.adoc#about-ovn-kubernetes[OVN-Kubernetes network plugin]. This plugin is the only Red Hat supported CNI plugin for {product-title}.
The default plugin for {product-title} is the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin. This plugin is the only Red Hat supported CNI plugin for {product-title}.  

If you choose to use your own CNI for {product-title} clusters, it is strongly recommended that you obtain commercial support from the plugin vendor before creating your clusters. Red Hat support cannot assist with CNI-related issues such as pod to pod traffic for customers who choose to use their own CNI. Red Hat still provides support for all non-CNI issues. If you want CNI-related support from Red Hat, you must install the cluster with the default OVN-Kubernetes network plugin. For more information, see the xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-policy-responsibility-matrix.adoc#rosa-policy-responsibility-matrix[responsibility matrix].
