== {hcp-title} Prerequisites

To create a {hcp-title} cluster, you must have the following items:

* A configured virtual private cloud (VPC)
* Account-wide roles
* An OIDC configuration
* Operator roles

[id="rosa-hcp-creating-cluster-with-aws-kms-key-creating-vpc"]
=== Creating a Virtual Private Cloud for your {hcp-title} clusters

You must have a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to create {hcp-title} cluster. You can use the following methods to create a VPC: 

* Create a VPC by using a Terraform template
* Manually create the VPC resources in the AWS console

[NOTE]
====
The Terraform instructions are for testing and demonstration purposes. Your own installation requires some modifications to the VPC for your own use. You should also ensure that when you use this Terraform script it is in the same region that you intend to install your cluster. In these examples, use `us-east-2`.
