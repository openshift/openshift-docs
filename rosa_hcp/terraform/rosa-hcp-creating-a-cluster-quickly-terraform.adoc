Create a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster quickly by using a Terraform cluster template that is configured with the default cluster options.

The cluster creation process described below uses a Terraform configuration that prepares a {hcp-title} cluster with the following resources:

* An OIDC provider with a managed `oidc-config` configuration
* Prerequisite IAM Operator roles with associated AWS Managed ROSA Policies
* IAM account roles with associated AWS Managed ROSA Policies
* All other AWS resources required to create a ROSA with STS cluster
