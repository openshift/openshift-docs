toc::[]

You can manually back up and restore the {product-title} database on all supported systems. The {product-title} service must be stopped and Greenboot health checks must be completed prior to any backups.

[NOTE]
====
Only {product-title} data is backed up with the following procedures. Application data is not included.
====

* On `rpm-ostree` systems, {product-title} automatically creates a backup on every start. These automatic backups are deleted and replaced with the latest backup each time the system restarts.
* If you are using an `rpm-ostree` system, restoring data is also automated. Otherwise, you must back up and restore data manually.
