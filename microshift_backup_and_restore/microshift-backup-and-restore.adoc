= Backing up and restoring {microshift-short} data
:context: microshift-backup-and-restore

toc::[]

You can manually back up and restore the {microshift-short} database on all supported systems. Greenboot health checks must be completed and you must stop the {microshift-short} service prior to any backups.

[NOTE]
====
Only {microshift-short} data is backed up with the following procedures. Application data is not included.
====

* On `rpm-ostree` systems, {microshift-short} automatically creates a backup on every start. These automatic backups are deleted and replaced with the latest backup each time the system restarts.
* If you are using an `rpm-ostree` system, the data is automatically restored after Greenboot rolls the system back. This data restoration ensures that the database matches the software running on the host after the rollback is completed.
* On other system types, you must back up and restore data manually.
