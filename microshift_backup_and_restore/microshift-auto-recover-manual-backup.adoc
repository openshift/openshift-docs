toc::[]

You can automatically restore data from manual backups when {microshift-short} fails to start by using the `auto-recovery` feature.

You can use the following options with the existing `backup` and `restore` commands in this feature:

* `--auto-recovery`: Selects the most recent version of the backup, and then restores it. This option treats the `PATH` argument as a path to a directory that holds all the backups for automated recovery, and not just as a path to a particular backup file.
* `--dont-save-failed`: Disables the backup of failed {microshift-short} data.

[NOTE]
====
* You can use the `--auto-recovery` option with both the `backup` and `restore` commands.
* You can use the `--dont-save-failed` option only with the `restore` command.
