== Definitions

For {SMProductName} 3, features that are Generally Available (GA) are fully supported and are suitable for production use.

Technology Preview (TP) features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features give early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and give feedback during the development process. See the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview scope of support on the Red Hat Customer Portal] for more information about Technology Preview features.

Developer Preview (DP) features are not supported by Red Hat in any way and are not functionally complete or production-ready. Do not use Developer Preview features for production or business-critical workloads. Developer Preview features give early access to upcoming product features in advance of their possible inclusion in a Red Hat product offering, enabling customers to test functionality and give feedback during the development process. These features might not have any documentation, are subject to change or removal at any time, and testing is limited. Red Hat might give ways to submit feedback on Developer Preview features without an associated SLA.

Not available (NA) features might not be available with {SMProductName} 3.
