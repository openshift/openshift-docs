With the {product-title} command line interface (CLI), you can
xref:../dev_guide/application_lifecycle/new_app.adoc#dev-guide-new-app[create applications] and manage {product-title}
xref:../dev_guide/projects.adoc#dev-guide-projects[projects] from a terminal. The CLI is ideal in
situations where you are:

- Working directly with project source code.
- Scripting {product-title} operations.
- Restricted by bandwidth resources and cannot use the
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-web-console[web console].
endif::[]

ifdef::atomic-registry[]
With the {product-title} command line interface (CLI), you can manage
{product-title} xref:../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#projects[projects]
from a terminal. The CLI is ideal in situations where you are:

- Scripting {product-title} operations.
- Do not wish to use the web console.

[NOTE]
CLI commands are intended for administrator use. The target user interface for
non-administrator users is the docker CLI and web console.

endif::[]

The CLI is available using the `oc` command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc <command>
----

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[NOTE]
====
The CLI command examples presented through {product-title} documentation use
`oc` command syntax. If the `oc` binary is not available on your workstation,
you can alternatively substitute `openshift cli` in the examples if you
have the `openshift` binary.
