With the OpenShift command line interface (CLI), you can
link:../dev_guide/new_app.html[create applications] and manage OpenShift
link:../dev_guide/projects.html[projects] from a terminal. The CLI is ideal in
situations where you are:

- Working directly with project source code.
- Scripting OpenShift operations.
- Restricted by bandwidth resources and cannot use the
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.html[web console].

The OpenShift CLI is available using the `oc` command:

----
$ oc <command>
----

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[NOTE]
====
The CLI command examples presented through OpenShift documentation use
`oc` command syntax. If the `oc` binary is not available on your workstation,
you can alternatively substitute `openshift cli` in the examples if you
have the `openshift` binary.

endif::[]

See link:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.html[Get Started with the CLI] for
installation and setup instructions.
