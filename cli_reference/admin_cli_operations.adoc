== Overview

This topic provides information on the administrator CLI operations and their
syntax. You must link:get_started_cli.html[setup and login] with the CLI before
you can perform these operations.

The administrator CLI uses the `oadm` command, and is used for administrator
operations. This differs from the link:basic_cli_operations.html[developer CLI],
which uses the `oc` command, and is used for basic, project-level operations.

[[oadm-common-operations]]

== Common Operations
The administrator CLI allows interaction with the various objects that are
managed by OpenShift. Many common `oadm` operations are invoked using the
following syntax:

----
$ oadm <action> <option>
----

This specifies:

- An `<action>` to perform, such as `new-project` or `router`.
- An available `<option>` to perform the action on as well as a value for the
option. Options include `--output` or `--credentials`.
