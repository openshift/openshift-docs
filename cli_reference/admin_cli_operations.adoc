== Overview

This topic provides information on the administrator CLI operations and their
syntax. You must xref:get_started_cli.adoc#cli-reference-get-started-cli[setup and login] with the CLI before
you can perform these operations.

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
The `openshift` command is used for starting services that make up the
{product-title}  cluster. For example, `openshift start [master|node]`. However,
it is also an all-in-one command that can perform all the same actions as the
`oc` and `oadm` commands via `openshift cli` and `openshift admin` respectively.

The `oadm` command is used for administrator CLI operations, which is a symlink
that can be used on hosts that have the `openshift` binary, such as a master. If
you are on a workstation that does not have the `openshift` binary, you can also
use `oc adm` in place of `oadm`, if `oc` is available.

ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
The `oc adm` command (formerly the `oadm` command) is used for administrator CLI
operations.
endif::[]
The administrator CLI differs from the normal set of commands under the
xref:basic_cli_operations.adoc#cli-reference-basic-cli-operations[developer CLI], which uses the `oc` command, and
is used more for project-level operations.

[[oadm-common-operations]]

== Common Operations
The administrator CLI allows interaction with the various objects that are
managed by {product-title}. Many common `oadm` operations are invoked using the
following syntax:

----
$ oadm <action> <option>
----

This specifies:

- An `<action>` to perform, such as `new-project` or `router`.
- An available `<option>` to perform the action on as well as a value for the
option. Options include `--output`.
