[role="_abstract"]
You can use the ROSA CLI (`rosa`) to link your cluster to the desired AWS billing account after the cluster has been deployed.

This can be useful if you have accidentally linked to the wrong AWS billing account during cluster deployment, or if you simply want to update the billing account.

[NOTE]
====
You also have the option to update your billing account through the {cluster-manager}.
