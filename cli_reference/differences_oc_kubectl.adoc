A copy of `kubectl` is included in {product-title} command line interface (CLI).
Although there are several similarities between these two clients, this guide's aim
is to clarify the main reasons and scenarios for using one over the other.

== Using oc

The `oc` binary offers the same capabilities as the `kubectl` binary, on top of that it is extencded
to natively support {product-title} features, such as:

- Full support for OpenShift resources (DeploymentConifgs, BuildConfigs, Routes, ImageStreams, ImageStreamTags, etc.).
These are resources specific to {product-title}, and not available in Kubernetes.
- Authentication: The `oc` binary offers a built-in `login` command which allows authentication.
See xref:../dev_guide/authentication.adoc[developer authentication] and
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc[configuring authentication] for more information.
- Additional commands, such as `new-app`, which make it easier to get new applications started using existing source code
or prebuilt images.

== Using kubectl

The `kubectl` binary is provided as a means to support existing workflows and scripts for users coming from a DIY
Kubernetes environment.

Existing users of `kubectl` can continue to use this binary with no changes to the api, but should consider upgrading
to `oc` in order to gain the added functionality mentioned in the previous section.

Because `oc` is built on top of `kubectl`, converting a `kubectl` binary to `oc` is as simple as changing the binary's name
from `kubectl` to `oc`.

See xref:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.adoc#cli-reference-get-started-cli[Get Started with the CLI] for
installation and setup instructions.
