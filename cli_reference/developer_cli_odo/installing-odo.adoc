// The following section describes how to install `{odo-title}` on different platforms using the CLI or the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) IDE.

You can install the `{odo-title}` CLI on Linux, Windows, or macOS by downloading a binary. You can also install the OpenShift VS Code extension, which uses both the `{odo-title}` and the `oc` binaries to interact with your OpenShift Container Platform cluster. For {op-system-base-full}, you can install the `{odo-title}` CLI as an RPM.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, `{odo-title}` does not support installation in a restricted network environment.

// You can also find the URL to the latest binaries from the {product-title} web console by clicking the *?* icon in the upper-right corner and selecting *Command Line Tools*
