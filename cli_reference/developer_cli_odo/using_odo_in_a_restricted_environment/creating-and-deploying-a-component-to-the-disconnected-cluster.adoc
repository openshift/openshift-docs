After you push the `init` image to a cluster with a mirrored registry, you must mirror a supported builder image for your application with the `oc` tool, overwrite the mirror registry using the environment variable, and then create your component.

== Prerequisites

* Install `oc` on the client operating system.
* xref:../../../cli_reference/developer_cli_odo/installing-odo.adoc#installing-odo-on-linux_installing-odo[Install `{odo-title}`] on the client operating system.
* Access to an restricted cluster with a configured internal registry or a mirror registry.
