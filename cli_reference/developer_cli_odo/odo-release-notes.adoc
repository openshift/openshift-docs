[id="odo-notable-improvements_{context}"]
== Notable changes and improvements in `{odo-title}`

* The `--devfile` flag is added to `odo create`. Run `odo create <component name> --devfile <devfile path>` to specify your devfile location. This flag is only available in the Experimental Mode. See xref:odo-technology-preview_odo-release-notes[Technology Preview features] to learn how to enable it.

* Dynamic registry support. Now you can configure your own registries with the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# Add a registry to the registry list
odo registry add <registry name> <registry URL>

# List a registry in the registry list
odo registry list

# Delete a registry from the registry list
odo registry delete <registry name>

# Update a registry in the registry list
odo registry update <registry name> <registry URL>

# List a component with a corresponding registry
odo catalog list components

# Create a component that is hosted by a specific registry
odo create <component type> --registry <registry name>
----

* The `--starter` flag is added to `odo create`. Run `odo create nodejs --starter <project-name>` to download the source code of a project specified in the devfile. If no project name is specified, `odo` downloads the first one.

* The `--context` flag is added to `odo push`. With `--context`, you can trigger `odo push` from outside the source code directory. Run `odo push --devfile <path to the devfile> --context <directory with your component>` to specify the directory of your component.

* Performance improvement for `odo catalog list components` when using the devfiles.

* The `--now` flag is added for `odo url delete` when using the devfiles.

* `odo url delete --now` now works with the devfiles.
* The `--debug` flag now works with the devfiles.

* Added machine-readable output for listing Operator-backed services. Run `odo catalog list services -o json` to display information about Operators and services in JSON format.

* Added machine-readable output for debugging. Run `odo debug info -o json` to display the debugging information in JSON format.

* Added machine-readable output for `odo push`. Run `odo push -o json` to display event notifications in JSON format.
