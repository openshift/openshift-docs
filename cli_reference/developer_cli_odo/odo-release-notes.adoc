== Notable changes and improvements in `{odo-title}`

* A `--now` flag is added for `odo create`, `odo url`, and `odo config`.
+
Run `odo url create --now` to create the URL in the configuration and propagate all the changes to the cluster.
* An `odo debug info` command is added. The command displays if the debug mode is enabled for a component, if the port-forward process is running, and information about ports used.
* The `odo push` output now shows the exact error from the OpenShift cluster on failure.
+
* A `--secure` flag is added for `odo url`. It indicates whether a URL is secure.
* `odo storage list` now displays the information about the storage state: `Pushed`, `NotPushed` or `Locally Deleted`.
* `odo debug port-forward` now selects a port automatically if the default port (5858) is occupied.
* The `--all` flag is renamed to  `--all-apps`.
* The default PVC size has been increased to 10GiB.
* The JSON output for `odo storage list -o json` has been restructured.
* `nodejs-8` and `nodejs-10` images are no longer supported.
* Experimental mode feature. By default, features under development or in experimental mode are hidden from the user.
+
** To enable experimental mode, run:
+
----
$ odo config set --env ODO_EXPERIMENTAL=true
----
+
or
+
----
$ odo preference set experimental true
----
** To disable experimental mode, run:
+
----
$ odo config unset --env ODO_EXPERIMENTAL
----
+
or
+
----
$ odo preference set experimental false
----

* `{odo-title}` now supports Ingress to create URLs on Kubernetes.

== Technology Preview features `{odo-title}`

* `odo debug` is a feature that allows users to attach a local debugger to a component running in the Pod. To learn more, see xref:../../cli_reference/developer_cli_odo/debugging-applications-in-odo.adoc#debugging-an-application_debugging-applications-in-odo[Debugging applications in odo]

:FeatureName: odo debug
include::modules/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

* Devfile support. You can now create and deploy your applications using the devfiles with `{odo-title}`. A devfile is a file that defines the development environment: environment variables, image, and so on. To access this feature, you must enable experimental mode with `odo preference set experimental true`.
