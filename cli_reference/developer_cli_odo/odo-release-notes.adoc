[id="odo-notable-improvements_{context}"]
== Notable changes and improvements in `{odo-title}`

* `{odo-title}` now supports Devfile v2.

* `odo create -s2i` now converts an S2I component into a devfile component. When running `odo create --s2i <component-type>` `{odo-title}` now creates a converted Devfile component based on the S2I images of the specified component type.
+
Note that this feature introduces many breaking changes, see xref:../../cli_reference/developer_cli_odo/odo-release-notes.adoc#odo-known-issues_odo-release-notes[Known Issues] to learn more.

* Operator based service is now created on the cluster only after you run `odo push` and not after `odo service create` anymore.

* You can now use the `--container` flag to specify the container you want to attach storage to when running `odo storage create` command. See xref:../../cli_reference/developer_cli_odo/creating_and_deploying_applications_with_odo/working-with-storage.adoc#adding-storage-to-a-specific-container_working-with-storage[Adding storage to a specific container] to learn the details.

* `odo catalog component describe` now returns correct JSON if the same name is used for a component in multiple registries.

* Commands that implement changes directly on a cluster now display a message informing a user that `odo push` is not required.

* When creating a component from a devfile, `odo create` now uses a default component name if the name is not specified.

* `odo` now has Telemetry. See xref:../../cli_reference/developer_cli_odo/understanding-odo.adoc#telemetry-in-odo[Telemetry section] to learn how to modify your Telemetry consent preferences.

*  With `odo service`, you can now add or remove custom resource definitions and `ServiceInstance` information in your devfile.

* link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1760586[Bug 1760586] The `odo delete` command starts an infinite loop after a project is deleted and a component name is set.

* link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1760588[Bug 1760588] The `odo service create` command crashes when run in Cygwin.

* link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1760590[Bug 1760590] In Git BASH for Windows, the `odo login -u developer` command does not hide a typed password when requested.

* link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1783188[Bug 1783188] In a disconnected cluster, the `odo component create` command throws an error `...tag not found...` despite the component being listed in the catalog list.

* link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1761440[Bug 1761440] It is not possible to create two Services of the same type in one project.

* link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1821643[Bug 1821643] `odo push` does not work on the .NET component tag 2.1+.

Workaround: specify your .NET project file by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ odo config set --env DOTNET_STARTUP_PROJECT=<path_to_your_project>
----

* When running `odo url create` after `odo create --s2i`, the command fails. `{odo-title}` creates a URL now directly without asking. 

* Wildfly and dotnet S2I components cannot be created with `odo create`.

* `odo env set DebugPort` does not work with converted devfile components. Workaround: use `odo config set --env DEBUG_PORT`.
