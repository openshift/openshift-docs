The Operator SDK provides a command-line interface (CLI) tool that Operator developers can use to build, test, and deploy an Operator. You can install the Operator SDK CLI on your workstation so that you are prepared to start authoring your own Operators.

See xref:../../operators/operator_sdk/osdk-about.adoc#osdk-about[Developing Operators] for full documentation on the Operator SDK.

[NOTE]
