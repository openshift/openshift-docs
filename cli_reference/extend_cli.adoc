[[cli-plugins-overview]]
== Overview

This topic reviews how to install and write extensions for the CLI. Usually
called _plug-ins_ or _binary extensions_, this feature allows you to extend the
default set of `oc` commands available and, therefore, allows you to perform new
tasks.

A plug-in is a set of files: typically at least one *_plugin.yaml_* descriptor
and one or more binary, script, or assets files.

CLI plug-ins are currently only available under the `oc plugin` subcommand.

[IMPORTANT]
====
CLI plug-ins are currently a Technology Preview feature.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to
upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide
feedback during the development process.

See the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Red Hat
Technology Preview features support scope] for more information.

[[cli-plugins-prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

You must have:

- A xref:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.adoc#cli-reference-get-started-cli[working `oc` binary installed].

[[cli-installing-plugins]]
== Installing Plug-ins

Copy the plug-in's *_plugin.yaml_* descriptor, binaries, scripts, and assets
files to one of the locations in the file system where `oc` searches for
plug-ins.

Currently, {product-title} does not provide a package manager for plug-ins.
Therefore, it is your responsibility to place the plug-in files in the correct
location. It is recommended that each plug-in is located on its own directory.

To install a plug-in that is distributed as a compressed file, extract it to one
of the locations specified in xref:cli-plugin-loader[The Plug-in Loader] section.

[[cli-plugin-loader]]
=== The Plug-in Loader

The plug-in loader is responsible for
xref:cli-plugin-loader-search-order[searching plug-in files], and checking if
the plug-in provides the minimum amount of information required for it to run.
Files placed in the correct location that do not provide the minimum amount of
information (for example, an incomplete *_plugin.yaml_* descriptor) are ignored.

[[cli-plugin-loader-search-order]]
==== Search Order
The plug-in loader uses the following search order:

. `${KUBECTL_PLUGINS_PATH}`
+
If specified, the search stops here.
+
If the `KUBECTL_PLUGINS_PATH` environment variable is present, the loader uses
it as the only location to look for plug-ins. The `KUBECTL_PLUGINS_PATH`
environment variable is a list of directories. In Linux and Mac, the list is
colon-delimited. In Windows, the list is semicolon-delimited.
+
If `KUBECTL_PLUGINS_PATH` is not present, the loader begins to search the
additional locations.

. `${XDG_DATA_DIRS}/kubectl/plugins`
+
The plug-in loader searches one or more directories specified according to the
link:https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html[XDG
System Directory Structure] specification.
+
Specifically, the loader locates the directories specified by the
`XDG_DATA_DIRS` environment variable. The plug-in loader searches the
*_kubectl/plugins_* directory inside of directories specified by the
`XDG_DATA_DIRS` environment variable. If `XDG_DATA_DIRS` is not specified, it
defaults to *_/usr/local/share:/usr/share_*.

. `~/.kube/plugins`
+
The `plugins` directory under the user's *_kubeconfig_* directory. In most
cases, this is *_~/.kube/plugins_*:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# Loads plugins from both /path/to/dir1 and /path/to/dir2
$ KUBECTL_PLUGINS_PATH=/path/to/dir1:/path/to/dir2 kubectl plugin -h
----

[[cli-writing-plugins]]
== Writing Plug-ins

You can write a plug-in in any programming language or script that allows you to
write CLI commands. A plug-in does not necessarily need to have a binary
component. It could rely entirely on operating system utilities like `echo`,
`sed`, or `grep`. Alternatively, it could rely on the `oc` binary.

The only strong requirement for an `oc` plug-in is the *_plugin.yaml_*
descriptor file. This file is responsible for declaring at least the minimum
attributes required to register a plug-in and must be located under one of the
locations specified in the xref:cli-plugin-loader-search-order[Search Order]
section.

[[cli-writing-plugins-descriptor]]
=== The plugin.yaml Descriptor

The descriptor file supports the following attributes:

----
name: "great-plugin"              # REQUIRED: the plug-in command name, to be invoked under 'kubectl'
shortDesc: "great-plugin plug-in" # REQUIRED: the command short description, for help
longDesc: ""                      # the command long description, for help
example: ""                       # command example(s), for help
command: "./example"              # REQUIRED: the command, binary, or script to invoke when running the plug-in
flags:                            # flags supported by the plug-in
  - name: "flag-name"             # REQUIRED for each flag: flag name
    shorthand: "f"                # short version of the flag name
    desc: "example flag"          # REQUIRED for each flag: flag description
    defValue: "extreme"           # default value of the flag
tree:                             # allows the declaration of subcommands
  - ...                           # subcommands support the same set of attributes
----

The preceding descriptor declares the `great-plugin` plug-in, which has
one flag named `-f | --flag-name`. It could be invoked as:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc plugin great-plugin -f value
----

When the plug-in is invoked, it calls the `example` binary or script, which is
located in the same directory as the descriptor file, passing a number of
arguments and environment variables. The
xref:cli-writing-plugins-accessing-runtime-attributes[Accessing Runtime
Attributes] section describes how the `example` command accesses the flag value
and other runtime context.

[[cli-writing-plugins-directory-structure]]
=== Recommended Directory Structure

It is recommended that each plug-in has its own subdirectory in the file system,
preferably with the same name as the plug-in command. The directory must contain
the *_plugin.yaml_* descriptor and any binary, script, asset, or other
dependency it might require.

For example, the directory structure for the `great-plugin` plug-in could look like
this:

----
~/.kube/plugins/
└── great-plugin
    ├── plugin.yaml
    └── example
----

[[cli-writing-plugins-accessing-runtime-attributes]]
=== Accessing Runtime Attributes

In most use cases, the binary or script file you write to support the plug-in
must have access to some contextual information provided by the plug-in
framework. For example, if you declared flags in the descriptor file, your
plug-in must have access to the user-provided flag values at runtime.

The same is true for global flags. The plug-in framework is responsible for
doing that, so plug-in writers do not need to worry about parsing arguments.
This also ensures the best level of consistency between plug-ins and regular
`oc` commands.

Plug-ins have access to runtime context attributes through environment
variables. To access the value provided through a flag, for example, look for
the value of the proper environment variable using the appropriate function call
for your binary or script.

The supported environment variables are:

* `KUBECTL_PLUGINS_CALLER`: The full path to the `oc` binary that was used in the
current command invocation. As a plug-in writer, you do not have to implement
logic to authenticate and access the Kubernetes API. Instead, you can use the
value provided by this environment variable to invoke `oc` and obtain the
information you need, using for example `oc get --raw=/apis`.

* `KUBECTL_PLUGINS_CURRENT_NAMESPACE`: The current namespace that is the context
for this call. This is the actual namespace to be considered in namespaced
operations, meaning it was already processed in terms of the precedence between
what was provided through the kubeconfig, the `--namespace` global flag,
environment variables, and so on.

* `KUBECTL_PLUGINS_DESCRIPTOR_*`: One environment variable for every attribute
declared in the *_plugin.yaml_* descriptor. For example,
`KUBECTL_PLUGINS_DESCRIPTOR_NAME`, `KUBECTL_PLUGINS_DESCRIPTOR_COMMAND`.

* `KUBECTL_PLUGINS_GLOBAL_FLAG_*`: One environment variable for every global flag
supported by `oc`. For example, `KUBECTL_PLUGINS_GLOBAL_FLAG_NAMESPACE`,
`KUBECTL_PLUGINS_GLOBAL_FLAG_LOGLEVEL`.

* `KUBECTL_PLUGINS_LOCAL_FLAG_*`: One environment variable for every local flag
declared in the *_plugin.yaml_* descriptor. For example,
`KUBECTL_PLUGINS_LOCAL_FLAG_HEAT` in the preceding `great-plugin` example.
