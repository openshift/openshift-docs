== Overview
This topic provides information on the developer CLI operations and their
syntax. You must xref:get_started_cli.adoc#cli-reference-get-started-cli[setup and login] with the CLI before
you can perform these operations.

The developer CLI uses the `oc` command, and is used for project-level
operations. This differs from the xref:admin_cli_operations.adoc#cli-reference-admin-cli-operations[administrator
CLI], which uses the `oadm` command for more advanced, administrator operations.

[[oc-common-operations]]

== Common Operations
The developer CLI allows interaction with the various
objects that are managed by {product-title}. Many common `oc` operations are invoked
using the following syntax:

----
$ oc <action> <object_type> <object_name>
----

This specifies:

- An `<action>` to perform, such as `get` or `describe`.
- The `<object_type>` to perform the action on, such as `service` or the
abbreviated `svc`.
- The `<object_name>` of the specified `<object_type>`.

For example, the `oc get` operation returns a complete list of services that are
currently defined:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc get svc
NAME              LABELS                                    SELECTOR                  IP              PORT(S)
docker-registry   docker-registry=default                   docker-registry=default   172.30.78.158   5000/TCP
kubernetes        component=apiserver,provider=kubernetes   <none>                    172.30.0.2      443/TCP
kubernetes-ro     component=apiserver,provider=kubernetes   <none>                    172.30.0.1      80/TCP
----
====

The `oc describe` operation can then be used to return detailed information
about a specific object:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc describe svc docker-registry
Name:			docker-registry
Labels:			docker-registry=default
Selector:		docker-registry=default
IP:			172.30.78.158
Port:			<unnamed>	5000/TCP
Endpoints:		10.128.0.2:5000
Session Affinity:	None
No events.
----
====

[WARNING]
====
Versions of `oc` prior to
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
1.0.5
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
3.0.2.0
endif::[]
did not have the ability to negotiate API versions against a server. So if you
are using `oc` up to
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
1.0.4
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
3.0.1.0
endif::[]
with a server that only supports v1 or higher versions of the API, make sure to
pass `--api-version` in order to point the `oc` client to the correct API
endpoint. For example: `oc get svc --api-version=v1`.
====

[[object-types]]

== Object Types
The CLI supports the following object types, some of which have abbreviated
syntax:

[[application-modification-cli-operations]]

== Application Modification CLI Operations

=== get
Return a list of objects for the specified xref:object-types[object type]. If
the optional `<object_name>` is included in the request, then the list of
results is filtered by that value.
----
$ oc get <object_type> [<object_name>]
----

=== describe
Returns information about the specific object returned by the query. A specific
`<object_name>` must be provided. The actual information that is available
varies as described in xref:object-types[object type].
----
$ oc describe <object_type> <object_name>
----

=== edit
Edit the desired object type:
----
$ oc edit <object_type>/<object_name>
----
Edit the desired object type with a specified text editor:
----
$ OC_EDITOR="<text_editor>" oc edit <object_type>/<object_name>
----
Edit the desired object in a specified format (eg: JSON):
----
$ oc edit <object_type>/<object_name> \
    --output-version=<object_type_version> \
    -o <object_type_format>
----

=== volume
Modify a xref:../dev_guide/volumes.adoc#dev-guide-volumes[volume]:
----
$ oc volume <object_type>/<object_name> [--option]
----

=== label
Update the labels on a object:
----
$ oc label <object_type> <object_name> <label>
----

[[expose]]
=== expose
Look up a service and expose it as a route. There is also the ability to expose
a deployment configuration, replication controller, service, or pod as a new
service on a specified port. If no labels are specified, the new object will
re-use the labels from the object it exposes.

If you are exposing a service, the default generator is
`--generator=route/v1`. For all other cases the default is
`--generator=service/v2`, which leaves the port unnamed. Generally, there is
no need to set a generator with the `oc expose` command. A third generator,
`--generator=service/v1`, is available with the port name default.
----
$ oc expose <object_type> <object_name>
----

=== delete
Delete the specified object. An object configuration can also be passed in
through STDIN. The `oc delete all -l <label>` operation deletes all objects
matching the specified `<label>`, including the
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#replication-controllers[replication
controller] so that pods are not re-created.
----
$ oc delete -f <file_path>
----
----
$ oc delete <object_type> <object_name>
----
----
$ oc delete <object_type> -l <label>
----
----
$ oc delete all -l <label>
----

=== set

==== set env
Sets an environment variable on a deployment configuration or a build configuration:
----
$ oc set env dc/mydc VAR1=value1
----

==== set build-secret
Sets the name of a secret on a build configuration. The secret may be an image pull or
push secret or a source repository secret:
----
$ oc set build-secret --source bc/mybc mysecret
----

[[build-and-deployment-cli-operations]]

== Build and Deployment CLI Operations
One of the fundamental capabilities of {product-title} is the ability to build
applications into a container from source.

{product-title} provides CLI access to inspect and manipulate deployment
configurations using standard `oc` resource operations, such as `get`, `create`,
and `describe`.

=== start-build
Manually start the build process with the specified build configuration file:

----
$ oc start-build <buildconfig_name>
----

Manually start the build process by specifying the name of a previous build as a
starting point:

----
$ oc start-build --from-build=<build_name>
----

Manually start the build process by specifying either a configuration file or
the name of a previous build and retrieve its build logs:

----
$ oc start-build --from-build=<build_name> --follow
----

----
$ oc start-build <buildconfig_name> --follow
----

Wait for a build to complete and exit with a non-zero return code if the build
fails:

----
$ oc start-build --from-build=<build_name> --wait
----

Set or override environment variables for the current build without changing the
build configuration. Alternatively, use `-e`.

----
$ oc start-build --env <var_name>=<value>
----

Set or override the default build log level output during the build:

----
$ oc start-build --build-loglevel [0-5]
----

Specify the source code commit identifier the build should use; requires a build
based on a Git repository:

----
$ oc start-build --commit=<hash>
----

Re-run build with name `<build_name>`:

----
$ oc start-build --from-build=<build_name>
----

Archive `<dir_name>` and build with it as the binary input:

----
$ oc start-build --from-dir=<dir_name>
----

Use existing archive as the binary input; unlike `--from-file` the archive
will be extracted by the builder prior to the build process:

----
$ oc start-build --from-archive=<archive_name>
----

Use `<file_name>` as the binary input for the build. This file must be the only
one in the build source. For example, *_pom.xml_* or *_Dockerfile_*.

----
$ oc start-build --from-file=<file_name>
----

Download the binary input using HTTP or HTTPS instead of reading it from the file
system:

----
$ oc start-build --from-file=<file_URL>
----

Download an archive and use its contents as the build source:

----
$ oc start-build --from-archive=<archive_URL>
----

The path to a local source code repository to use as the binary input for a
build:

----
$ oc start-build --from-repo=<path_to_repo>
----

Specify a webhook URL for an existing build configuration to trigger:

----
$ oc start-build --from-webhook=<webhook_URL>
----

The contents of the post-receive hook to trigger a build:

----
$ oc start-build --git-post-receive=<contents>
----

The path to the Git repository for post-receive; defaults to the current
directory:

----
$ oc start-build --git-repository=<path_to_repo>
----

List the webhooks for the specified build configuration or build; accepts `all`,
`generic`, or `github`:

----
$ oc start-build --list-webhooks
----

=== deploy
View a deployment, or manually start, cancel, or retry a deployment:

----
$ oc deploy <deploymentconfig>
----

=== rollback
Perform a
xref:../dev_guide/deployments/basic_deployment_operations.adoc#rolling-back-a-deployment[rollback]:
----
$ oc rollback <deployment_name>
----

=== new-build
Create a build configuration based on the source code in the current Git
repository (with a public remote) and a container image:
----
$ oc new-build .
----

=== cancel-build
Stop a build that is in progress:
----
$ oc cancel-build <build_name>
----

Cancel multiple builds at the same time:
----
$ oc cancel-build <build1_name> <build2_name> <build3_name>
----

Cancel all builds created from the build configuration:
----
$ oc cancel-build bc/<buildconfig_name>
----

Specify the builds to be canceled:
----
$ oc cancel-build bc/<buildconfig_name> --state=<state>
----
Example values for `*state*` are *new* or *pending*.

=== import-image
Import tag and image information from an external image repository:
----
$ oc import-image <image_stream>
----

=== scale
Set the number of desired replicas for a
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#replication-controllers[replication controller] or a deployment configuration to the number of specified replicas:

----
$ oc scale <object_type> <object_name> --replicas=<#_of_replicas>
----

=== tag
Take an existing tag or image from an image stream, or a container image "pull spec",
and set it as the most recent image for a tag in one or more other image
streams:
----
$ oc tag <current_image> <image_stream>
----

[[advanced-commands]]

== Advanced Commands

=== create
Parse a configuration file and create one or more {product-title} objects based
on the file contents. The `-f` flag can be passed multiple times with different
file or directory paths. When the flag is passed multiple times, `oc create`
iterates through each one, creating the objects described in all of the
indicated files. Any existing resources are ignored.
----
$ oc create -f <file_or_dir_path>
----

=== replace
Attempt to modify an existing object based on the contents of the specified
configuration file. The `-f` flag can be passed multiple times with different
file or directory paths. When the flag is passed multiple times, `oc replace`
iterates through each one, updating the objects described in all of the
indicated files.
----
$ oc replace -f <file_or_dir_path>
----

=== process
Transform a project xref:../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[template] into a project
configuration file:
----
$ oc process -f <template_file_path>
----

=== run
Create and run a particular image, possibly replicated. Create a deployment
configuration to manage the created container(s). You can choose to run in the
foreground for an interactive container execution.
----
$ oc run NAME --image=<image> \
    [--port=<port>] \
    [--replicas=<replicas>] \
    [--dry-run=<bool>] \
    [--overrides=<inline-json>] \
    [options]
----

=== patch
Updates one or more fields of an object using strategic merge patch:
----
$ oc patch <object_type> <object_name> -p <changes>
----

The <changes> is a JSON or YAML expression containing the new fields and the
values. For example, to update the `spec.unschedulable` field of the node
`node1` to the value `true`, the json expression is:

----
$ oc patch node node1 -p '{"spec":{"unschedulable":true}}'
----

=== export
Export resources to be used elsewhere:
----
$ oc export <object_type> [--options]
----

=== policy
Manage authorization policies:
----
$ oc policy [--options]
----

----
$ oc secrets [--options] path/to/ssh_key
----

=== autoscale
Setup an xref:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.adoc#dev-guide-pod-autoscaling[autoscaler] for your
application. Requires metrics to be enabled in the cluster.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
See xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#install-config-cluster-metrics[Enabling Cluster Metrics] for
cluster administrator instructions, if needed.
