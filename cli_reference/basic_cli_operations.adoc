== Overview
This topic provides information on some general CLI operations and their syntax.
You must link:get_started_cli.html[setup and login] with the CLI before you can
perform these operations.

== Common Operations
The CLI allows interaction with the various objects that are managed by
OpenShift. Many common `osc` operations are invoked using the following syntax:

****
`$ osc _<action>_ _<object_type>_ _<object_name_or_id>_`
****

This specifies:

- An `_<action>_` to perform, such as `get` or `describe`.
- The `_<object_type>_` to perform the action on, such as `service` or the abbreviated `svc`.
- The `_<object_name_or_id>_` of the specified `_<object_type>_`.

For example, the `osc get` operation returns a complete list of services that
are currently defined:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ osc get svc
NAME              LABELS                                    SELECTOR                  IP              PORT(S)
docker-registry   docker-registry=default                   docker-registry=default   172.30.78.158   5000/TCP
kubernetes        component=apiserver,provider=kubernetes   <none>                    172.30.0.2      443/TCP
kubernetes-ro     component=apiserver,provider=kubernetes   <none>                    172.30.0.1      80/TCP
----
====

The `osc describe` operation can then be used to return detailed information
about a specific object:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ osc describe svc docker-registry
Name:			docker-registry
Labels:			docker-registry=default
Selector:		docker-registry=default
IP:			172.30.78.158
Port:			<unnamed>	5000/TCP
Endpoints:		10.1.0.2:5000
Session Affinity:	None
No events.
----

The following table describes common `osc` operations and their general syntax:

.Common CLI Operations
[cols=".^2,.^5,8",options="header"]
|===

|Operation |Syntax |Description

|`get`
|`osc get _<object_type>_ _<object_name_or_id>_`
|Returns a list of objects for the specified link:#object-types[object type]. If the optional `_<object_name_or_id>_` is included in the request, then the list of results is filtered by that value.

|`describe`
|`osc describe _<object_type>_ _<object_id>_`
|Returns information about the specific object returned by the query; a specific `_<object_name_or_id>_` must be provided. The actual information that is available varies as described in link:#object-types[object type].

|`create`
|`osc create -f _<file_or_directory_path>_`
|Parses a configuration file and creates one or more OpenShift objects based on the file contents. The `-f` flag can be passed multiple times with different file or directory paths. When the flag is passed multiple times, `osc create` iterates through each one, creating the objects described in all of the indicated files. Any existing resources are ignored.

|`resize`
|`osc resize _<object_type>_ _<object_id>_ _<#_of_replicas>_`
|Sets the number of desired replicas for a replication controller or a deployment configuration to `_<#_of_replicas>_`.

|`update`
|`osc update -f _<file_or_directory_path>_`
|Attempts to modify an existing object based on the contents of the specified configuration file. The -f flag can be passed multiple times with different file or directory paths. When the flag is passed multiple times, `osc update` iterates through each one, updating the objects described in all of the indicated files.

|`delete`
a|`osc delete -f _<file_path>_`

`osc delete _<object_type>_ _<object_name_or_id>_`

`osc delete _<object_type>_ -l _<label>_`

`osc delete all -l _<label>_`
.^|Deletes the specified OpenShift object. An object configuration can also be passed in through STDIN. The `osc delete all -l _<label>_` operation deletes all objects matching the specified `_<label>_`.

|`log`
|`osc log -f _<pod_name>_ _<container_name>_`
|Retrieves the log output for a specific pod or container. This command does not work for other object types.
|===

|`label`
|`osc label _<object_type>_ _<object_name_or_id>_ _<label>_`
|Update the labels on a resource.

|`stop`
a|`osc stop -f _<file_path>_`

`osc stop _<object_type>_ _<object_name_or_id>_`

`osc stop _<object_type>_ -l _<label>_`

`osc stop all -l _<label>_`
.^|Gracefully shut down a resource by id or filename. Attempts to shut down and delete a resource that supports graceful termination.
|===

== Object Types
The CLI supports the following object types, some of which have abbreviated
syntax:

.Supported Object Types
[options="header"]
|===

|Object Type |Abbreviated Version

|`build` |
|`buildConfig` | `bc`
|`deploymentConfig` | `dc`
|`imageStream` | `is`
|`imageStreamTag` | `istag`
|`imageStreamImage` | `isimage`
|`event` |`ev`
|`minion` |`mi`
|`pod` |`po`
|`replicationController` |`rc`
|`service` |`svc`
|===

== Project Operations
These advanced operations for administrators are used to define and instantiate
OpenShift objects at the project level.

The simplest way to create a new project is:

****
`$ osadm new-project _<project_name>_ --display-name=_<display_name>_ --description=_<description>_ --admin=_<admin_username>_ --node-selector=_<node_label_selector>_`
****

The following example creates a new project called `test` that appears in the
Management Console as "Openshift 3 Sample", with `test-admin` as the project
admin and launches any pods onto nodes matching label `environment : test`.

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ osadm new-project test --display-name="OpenShift 3 Sample" --description="This is an example project to demonstrate OpenShift v3" --admin=anypassword:test-admin --node-selector="environment=test"`
----
====

.Project CLI Operations
[cols=".^2,.^5,8",options="header"]
|===

|Operation |Syntax |Description

|`process`
|`osc process -f _<template_file_path>_`
|Transforms a project template into a project configuration file.

|`apply`
|`osc apply -f _<config_file_path>_`
|Creates all of the OpenShift objects for a given project based on the specified configuration file.
|===

== Build Operations
One of the fundamental capabilities of OpenShift is the ability to build
applications into a container from source. The following table describes the CLI
operations for working with application builds.

.Build CLI Operations
[cols=".^2,.^5,8",options="header"]
|===

|Operation |Syntax |Description

|`start-build`
|`osc start-build _<buildConfig_name>_`
|Manually starts the build process with the specified build configuration file.

|`start-build`
|`osc start-build --from-build=_<build_name>_`
|Manually starts the build process by specifying the name of a previous build as a starting point.

|`start-build`
a|`osc start-build _<buildConfig_name>_ --follow`

`osc start-build --from-build=_<build_name>_ --follow`
|Manually starts the build process by specifying either a configuration file pr the name of a previous build _and_ retrieves its build logs.

|`cancel-build`
|`osc cancel-build _<build_name>_`
|Stops a build that is in progress.

|`build-logs`
|`osc build-logs _<build_name>_`
|Retrieves the build logs for the specified build.
|===

== Deployment Operations
OpenShift provides CLI access to inspect and manipulate
link:../dev_guide/deployments.html[deployment configurations] using standard
`osc` resource operations such as `get`, `create`, and `describe`.

Use the `osc describe` command to describe a deployment configuration in
human-readable form:

****
`$ osc describe dc _<deployment_config>_`
****

The following example describes a deployment configuration called
`docker-registry`:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ osc describe dc docker-registry
Name:		docker-registry
Created:	18 hours ago
Labels:		docker-registry=default
Latest Version:	1
Triggers:	Config
Strategy:	Recreate
Template:
	Selector:	docker-registry=default
	Replicas:	1
	Containers:
		NAME		IMAGE					ENV
		registry	openshift/origin-docker-registry:v0.4.3	OPENSHIFT_CA_DATA=[omitted for space],OPENSHIFT_MASTER=https://10.245.2.2:8443
Latest Deployment:
	Name:		docker-registry-1
	Status:		Complete
	Selector:	deployment=docker-registry-1,deploymentconfig=docker-registry,docker-registry=default
	Labels:		docker-registry=default
	Replicas:	1 current / 1 desired
	Pods Status:	1 Running / 0 Waiting / 0 Succeeded / 0 Failed
----
====

*Deployment Rollbacks*

Rollbacks revert an application back to a previous deployment, and they include
environment variable and volumes. Therefore, when deciding whether a rollback is
viable or not, among other things, consider the following:

- If security credentials have been recently updated, the previous deployment
may not have the correct values.
- If the previous deployment used a custom strategy which is no longer available
or usable, the deployment may not be deployed correctly.

During a rollback, only the configuration of pods and containers is changed by
default, while the scaling or trigger settings remain unchanged.

The `-d` or `--dry run` option shows the configuration of the updated deployment
in an easy to read format without actually executing the rollback. This allows
you to inspect the output before actually proceeding with the rollback.

Use the `osc rollback` command to revert part of an application back to a
previous deployment:

****
`$ osc rollback _<deployment>_ [_<options>_]`
****

.Rollback CLI Configuration Options
[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===

|Option |Description

.^|`--change-triggers`
|Include the previous deployment's triggers in the rollback.

.^|`--change-strategy`
|Include the previous deployment's strategy in the rollback.

.^|`-d, --dry-run`
|Instead of performing the rollback, describe what the rollback will look like in human-readable form.

.^|`-o, --output`
|Instead of performing the rollback, print the updated deployment configuration in the specified format: `json`\|`yaml`\|`template`\|`templatefile`.

.^|`-t, --template`
|Template string or path to template file to use when `-o=template` or `-o=templatefile`.
|===

To perform a rollback:

====

----
$ osc rollback deployment-1
----
====

To see what the rollback will look like without performing the rollback:

====

----
$ osc rollback deployment-1 --dry-run
----
====

To perform the rollback manually by piping the *JSON* of the new configuration back to `osc`:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ osc rollback deployment-1 --output=json | osc update deploymentConfigs deployment -f -
