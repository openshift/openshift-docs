== Overview

The {product-title} CLI exposes commands for managing your applications, as well as
lower level tools to interact with each component of your system. This topic
guides you through getting started with the CLI, including installation and
logging in to create your first project.

[[cli-prereqs]]
== Prerequisites

Certain operations require Git to be locally installed on a client. For example,
the command to create an application using a remote Git repository:

----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/<your_user>/<your_git_repo>
----

Before proceeding, install Git on your workstation. See the official
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[Git documentation]
for instructions per your workstation's operating system.

Installation options for the CLI vary depending on your operating system.

[[cli-windows]]
=== For Windows

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The CLI for Windows is provided as a *_zip_* archive; you can download it from
the https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290[Red Hat Customer Portal].
After logging in with your Red Hat account, you must have an active OpenShift
Enterprise subscription to access the downloads page:

https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290[*Download the CLI from the Red
Hat Customer Portal*]

Alternatively, if the cluster administrator has enabled it, you can download and
unpack the CLI from the *About* page on the web console.

*Tutorial Video:*

The following video walks you through this process:

[[cli-linux]]
=== For Linux

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
For Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7, you can install the CLI as an RPM using

[[basic-setup-and-login]]

== Basic Setup and Login
The `oc login` command is the best way to initially set up the CLI,
and it serves as the entry point for most users. The interactive flow helps you
establish a session to an {product-title} server with the provided credentials. The
information is automatically saved in a xref:cli-configuration-files[CLI
configuration file] that is then used for subsequent commands.

The following example shows the interactive setup and login using the `oc
login` command:

.Initial CLI Setup
====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc login
OpenShift server [https://localhost:8443]: https://openshift.example.com <1>

Username: alice <2>
Authentication required for https://openshift.example.com (openshift)
Password: ******
Login successful. <3>

You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    $ oc new-project <projectname> <4>

Welcome to OpenShift! See 'oc help' to get started.
----

<1> The command prompts for the {product-title} server URL.
<2> The command prompts for login credentials: a user name and password.
<3> A session is established with the server, and a session token is received.
<4> If you do not have a project, information is given on how to create one.
====

When you have completed the CLI configuration, subsequent commands use the
configuration file for the server, session token, and project information.

You can log out of CLI using the `oc logout` command:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc logout
User, alice, logged out of https://openshift.example.com
----
====

If you log in after creating or being granted access to a project, a project you
have access to is automatically set as the current default, until
xref:projects[switching to another one]:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc login
Username: alice
Authentication required for https://openshift.example.com (openshift)
Password:
Login successful.

Using project "aliceproject".
----
====

xref:../dev_guide/authentication.adoc#dev-guide-authentication[Additional options] are also available for
the `oc login` command.

include::dev_guide/authentication.adoc[tag=systemadminlogin]

[[cli-configuration-files]]

== CLI Configuration Files

A CLI configuration file permanently stores `oc` options and contains a series
of xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authentication[authentication]
mechanisms and {product-title} server connection information associated with
nicknames.

As described in the previous section, the `oc login` command automatically
creates and manages CLI configuration files. All information gathered by the
command is stored in a configuration file located in
*_~/.kube/config_*. The current CLI configuration can be viewed using the following command:

.Viewing the CLI Configuration
====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc config view
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    server: https://openshift.example.com
  name: openshift
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: openshift
    namespace: aliceproject
    user: alice
  name: alice
current-context: alice
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: alice
  user:
    token: NDM2N2MwODgtNjI1Yy10N3VhLTg1YmItYzI4NDEzZDUyYzVi
----
====

CLI configuration files can be used to xref:manage_cli_profiles.adoc#cli-reference-manage-cli-profiles[setup
multiple CLI profiles] using various {product-title} servers, namespaces, and users so
that you can switch easily between them. The CLI can support multiple
configuration files; they are loaded at runtime and merged together along with
any override options specified from the command line.

[[projects]]

== Projects
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
A xref:../dev_guide/projects.adoc#dev-guide-projects[project] in {product-title} contains multiple
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/index.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-index[objects] to make up a logical
application.

Most `oc` commands run in the context of a
xref:../dev_guide/projects.adoc#dev-guide-projects[project]. The `oc login` selects a default
project during xref:basic-setup-and-login[initial setup] to be used with
subsequent commands. Use the following command to display the project currently
in use:
endif::[]

----
$ oc project
----

If you have access to multiple projects, use the following syntax to switch to a
particular project by specifying the project name:

----
$ oc project <project_name>
----

For example:

====

----
$ oc project project02
Now using project 'project02'.

$ oc project project03
Now using project 'project03'.

$ oc project
Using project 'project03'.
----
====

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
The `oc status` command shows a high level overview of the project currently in
use, with its components and their relationships, as shown in the following
example:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc status
In project OpenShift 3 Sample (test)

service database-test (172.30.17.113:6434 -> 3306)
  database-test deploys docker.io/library/mysql:latest
    #1 deployed 47 hours ago

service frontend-test (172.30.17.236:5432 -> 8080)
  frontend-test deploys origin-ruby-sample:test <-
    builds https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world with docker.io/openshift/ruby-20-centos7:latest
    not built yet
    #1 deployment waiting on image

To see more information about a service or deployment config, use 'oc describe service <name>' or 'oc describe dc <name>'.
You can use 'oc get pods,svc,dc,bc,builds' to see lists of each of the types described above.
