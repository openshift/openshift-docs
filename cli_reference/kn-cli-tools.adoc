:context: kn-cli-tools
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

The Knative `kn` CLI enables simple interaction with Knative components on {product-title}.

You can enable Knative on {product-title} by installing {ServerlessProductName}. For more information, see xref:../serverless/serverless-getting-started.adoc#serverless-getting-started[Getting started with {ServerlessProductName}].

[NOTE]
====
{ServerlessProductName} cannot be installed using the `kn` CLI. A cluster administrator must install the {ServerlessOperatorName} and set up the Knative components, as described in the xref:../serverless/admin_guide/installing-openshift-serverless.adoc#installing-openshift-serverless[Serverless applications] documentation for {product-title}.

== Key features

The `kn` CLI is designed to make serverless computing tasks simple and concise.
Key features of the `kn` CLI include:

* Deploy serverless applications from the command line.
* Manage features of Knative Serving, such as services, revisions, and traffic-splitting.
* Create and manage Knative Eventing components, such as event sources and triggers.
* Create sink bindings to connect existing Kubernetes applications and Knative services.
* Extend the `kn` CLI with flexible plug-in architecture, similar to the `kubectl` CLI.
* Configure autoscaling parameters for Knative services.
* Scripted usage, such as waiting for the results of an operation, or deploying custom rollout and rollback strategies.
