== Overview
A CLI configuration file allows you to configure different profiles, or
_contexts_, for use with the xref:index.adoc#cli-reference-index[OpenShift CLI]. A context
consists of xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-authentication[user
authentication] and {product-title} server information associated with a _nickname_.

[[switching-between-cli-profiles]]

== Switching Between CLI Profiles

Contexts allow you to easily switch between multiple users across multiple
{product-title} servers, or _clusters_, when using issuing CLI operations. Nicknames
make managing CLI configuration easier by providing short-hand references to
contexts, user credentials, and cluster details.

After xref:get_started_cli.adoc#cli-reference-get-started-cli[logging in with the CLI] for the first time,
{product-title} creates a *_~/.kube/config_* file if one does not
already exist. As more authentication and connection details are provided to the
CLI, either automatically during an `oc login` operation or by
xref:manually-configuring-cli-profiles[setting them explicitly], the updated
information is stored in the configuration file:

<1> The `*clusters*` section defines connection details for {product-title} clusters,
including the address for their master server. In this example, one cluster is
nicknamed *openshift1.example.com:8443* and another is nicknamed
*openshift2.example.com:8443*.
<2> This `*contexts*` section defines two contexts: one nicknamed
*alice-project/openshift1.example.com:8443/alice*, using the *alice-project*
project, *openshift1.example.com:8443* cluster, and *alice* user, and another
nicknamed *joe-project/openshift1.example.com:8443/alice*, using the
*joe-project* project, *openshift1.example.com:8443* cluster and *alice* user.
<3> The `*current-context*` parameter shows that the
*joe-project/openshift1.example.com:8443/alice* context is currently in use,
allowing the *alice* user to work in the *joe-project* project on the
*openshift1.example.com:8443* cluster.
<4> The `*users*` section defines user credentials. In this example, the user
nickname *alice/openshift1.example.com:8443* uses an
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.adoc#api-authentication[access
token].

The CLI can support multiple configuration files; they are
xref:loading-and-merging-rules[loaded at runtime and merged together] along
with any override options specified from the command line.

After you are logged in, you can use the `oc status` command or the `oc
project` command to verify your current working environment:

To see more information about a service or deployment, use 'oc describe service <name>' or 'oc describe dc <name>'.
You can use 'oc get all' to see lists of each of the types described above.

----
====

To log in using any other combination of user credentials and cluster details,
run the `oc login` command again and supply the relevant information during the
interactive process. A context is constructed based on the supplied information
if one does not already exist.

If you are already logged in and want to switch to another project the current
user already has access to, use the `oc project` command and supply the name of
the project:

====

[source,terminal,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc project alice-project
----

.Example Output
[source,terminal]
----
Now using project "alice-project" on server "https://openshift1.example.com:8443".

At any time, you can use the `oc config view` command to view your current,
full CLI configuration, as seen in the output.

Additional CLI configuration commands are also available for more
xref:manually-configuring-cli-profiles[advanced usage].

[[manually-configuring-cli-profiles]]

== Manually Configuring CLI Profiles

[NOTE]
====
This section covers more advanced usage of CLI configurations. In most
situations, you can simply use the `oc login` and `oc project` commands to log
in and switch between contexts and projects.
====

If you want to manually configure your CLI configuration files, you can use the
`oc config` command instead of modifying the files themselves. The `oc config`
command includes a number of helpful subcommands for this purpose:

.CLI Configuration Subcommands
[cols="1,8",options="header"]
|===

|Subcommand |Usage

a|`set-cluster`
a|Sets a cluster entry in the CLI configuration file. If the referenced cluster
nickname already exists, the specified information is merged in.
[source,terminal,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc config set-cluster <cluster_nickname> [--server=<master_ip_or_fqdn>]
[--certificate-authority=<path/to/certificate/authority>]
[--api-version=<apiversion>] [--insecure-skip-tls-verify=true]
----

a|`set-context`
a|Sets a context entry in the CLI configuration file. If the referenced context
nickname already exists, the specified information is merged in.
[source,terminal,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc config set-context <context_nickname> [--cluster=<cluster_nickname>]
[--user=<user_nickname>] [--namespace=<namespace>]
----

a|`use-context`
a|Sets the current context using the specified context nickname.
[source,terminal,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc config use-context <context_nickname>
----

a|`set`
a|Sets an individual value in the CLI configuration file.
[source,terminal,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc config set <property_name> <property_value>
----
The `<property_name>` is a dot-delimited name where each token represents either
an attribute name or a map key. The `<property_value>` is the new value being
set.

a|`unset`
a|Unsets individual values in the CLI configuration file.
[source,terminal,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc config unset <property_name>
----
The `<property_name>` is a dot-delimited name where each token represents either
an attribute name or a map key.

a|`view`
a|Displays the merged CLI configuration currently in use.
[source,terminal,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc config view
----

Displays the result of the specified CLI configuration file.
[source,terminal,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc config view --config=<specific_filename>
----
|===

*Example Usage* [[example-usage]]

Consider the following configuration workflow. First, login as a user
that uses an
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.adoc#api-authentication[access
token]. This token is used by the *alice* user:

[source,terminal,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc login https://openshift1.example.com --token=ns7yVhuRNpDM9cgzfhhxQ7bM5s7N2ZVrkZepSRf4LC0
----

View the cluster entry automatically created:

[source,terminal,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc config view
----

.Example Output
[source,terminal]
----
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    insecure-skip-tls-verify: true
    server: https://openshift1.example.com
  name: openshift1-example-com
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: openshift1-example-com
    namespace: default
    user: alice/openshift1-example-com
  name: default/openshift1-example-com/alice
current-context: default/openshift1-example-com/alice
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: alice/openshift1.example.com
  user:
    token: ns7yVhuRNpDM9cgzfhhxQ7bM5s7N2ZVrkZepSRf4LC0
----

Update the current context to have users login to the
desired namespace:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc config set-context `oc config current-context` --namespace=<project_name>
----

To confirm that the changes have taken effect, examine the current
context:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc whoami -c
----

All subsequent CLI operations will use the new context, unless otherwise
specified by overriding CLI options or until the context is switched.

[[loading-and-merging-rules]]

== Loading and Merging Rules
When issuing CLI operations, the loading and merging order for the CLI
configuration follows these rules:

. CLI configuration files are retrieved from your workstation, using the
following hierarchy and merge rules:
- If the `--config` option is set, then only that file is loaded. The flag may
only be set once and no merging takes place.
- If `*$KUBECONFIG*` environment variable is set, then it is used. The
variable can be a list of paths, and if so the paths are merged together. When
a value is modified, it is modified in the file that defines the stanza. When
a value is created, it is created in the first file that exists. If no files
in the chain exist, then it creates the last file in the list.
- Otherwise, the *_~/.kube/config_* file is used and no
merging takes place.
{empty} +
{empty} +
. The context to use is determined based on the first hit in the following
chain:
- The value of the `--context` option.
- The `current-context` value from the CLI configuration file.
- An empty value is allowed at this stage.
{empty} +
{empty} +
. The user and cluster to use is determined. At this point, you may or may not
have a context; they are built based on the first hit in the following chain,
which is run once for the user and once for the cluster:
- The value of the `--user` option for user name and the `--cluster` option for
cluster name.
- If the `--context` option is present, then use the context's value.
- An empty value is allowed at this stage.
{empty} +
{empty} +
. The actual cluster information to use is determined. At this point, you may or
may not have cluster information. Each piece of the cluster information is built
based on the first hit in the following chain:
- The values of any of the following command line options:
* `--server`,
* `--api-version`
* `--certificate-authority`
* `--insecure-skip-tls-verify`
- If cluster information and a value for the attribute is present, then use it.
- If you do not have a server location, then there is an error.
{empty} +
{empty} +
. The actual user information to use is determined. Users are built using the
same rules as clusters, except that you can only have one authentication
technique per user; conflicting techniques cause the operation to fail. Command
line options take precedence over configuration file values. Valid command line
options are:
- `--auth-path`
- `--client-certificate`
- `--client-key`
- `--token`
{empty} +
{empty} +
. For any information that is still missing, default values are used and prompts
are given for additional information.
