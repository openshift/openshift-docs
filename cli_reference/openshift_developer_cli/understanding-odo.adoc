{odo-title-full} ({odo-title}) is a fast and easy-to-use CLI tool for creating applications on {product-title}. {odo-title} allows developers to concentrate on creating applications without the need to administrate an {product-title} cluster itself.
Creating deployment configurations, build configurations, service routes and other {product-title} elements are all automated by {odo-title}.

Existing tools such as `oc` are more operations-focused and require a deep understanding of Kubernetes and {product-title} concepts. {odo-title} abstracts away complex Kubernetes and {product-title} concepts allowing developers to focus on what is most important to them: code.

[id="odo-key-features"]
== Key features

{odo-title} is designed to be simple and concise with the following key features:

* Simple syntax and design centered around concepts familiar to developers, such as projects, applications, and components.
* Completely client based. No server is required within the {product-title} cluster for deployment.
* Official support for Node.js and Java components.
* Partial compatibility with languages and frameworks such as Ruby, Perl, PHP, and Python. 
* Detects changes to local code and deploys it to the cluster automatically, giving instant feedback to validate changes in real time.
* Lists all the available components and services from the {product-title} cluster.

== Core concepts

Project::
A project is your source code, tests, and libraries organized in a separate single unit.
Application::
An application is a program designed for end users. An application consists of multiple microservices or components that work individually to build the entire application.
Examples of applications: a video game, a media player, a web browser.
Component::
A component is a building block of an application. Typically it is a software package, a web service, a web resource, or a module that encapsulates a set of related functions or data. 
Examples of components: Node.js, Pearl, PHP, Python, Ruby.
Service::
A service is software that your component links to or depends on. 
Examples of services: MariaDB, Jenkins, MySQL. 
In {odo-title}, services are provisioned from the OpenShift Service Catalog and must be enabled within your cluster.

==== Listing available container images

[NOTE]
====
The list of available container images is sourced from the cluster's internal container registry and external registries associated with the cluster.

To list the available components and associated container images for your cluster:

. Log in to the {product-title} cluster with {odo-title}:
+
----
$ odo login -u developer -p developer
----

. List the available {odo-title} supported and unsupported components and corresponding container images:
