:context: usage-oc-kubectl

The Kubernetes command-line interface (CLI), `kubectl`, can be used to run commands against a Kubernetes cluster. Because {product-title} is a certified Kubernetes distribution, you can use the supported `kubectl` binaries that ship with {product-title}, or you can gain extended functionality by using the `oc` binary.

== The oc binary

The `oc` binary offers the same capabilities as the `kubectl` binary, but it extends to natively support additional {product-title} features, including:

* **Full support for {product-title} resources**
+
Resources such as `DeploymentConfig`, `BuildConfig`, `Route`, `ImageStream`, and `ImageStreamTag` objects are specific to {product-title} distributions, and build upon standard Kubernetes primitives.
+
* **Authentication**
+
The `oc` binary offers a built-in `login` command that allows authentication and enables you to work with {product-title} projects, which map Kubernetes namespaces to authenticated users. See xref:../../authentication/understanding-authentication.adoc#understanding-authentication[Understanding authentication] for more information.
+
* **Additional commands**
+
The additional command `oc new-app`, for example, makes it easier to get new applications started using existing source code or pre-built images. Similarly, the additional command `oc new-project` makes it easier to start a project that you can switch to as your default.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you installed an earlier version of the `oc` binary, you cannot use it to complete all of the commands in {product-title} {product-version}. If you want the latest features, you must download and install the latest version of the `oc` binary corresponding to your {product-title} server version.
====

Non-security API changes will involve, at minimum, two minor releases (4.1 to 4.2 to 4.3, for example) to allow older `oc` binaries to update. Using new capabilities might require newer `oc` binaries. A 4.3 server might have additional capabilities that a 4.2 `oc` binary cannot use and a 4.3 `oc` binary might have additional capabilities that are unsupported by a 4.2 server.

image:redcircle-3.png[] `oc` client might provide options and features that might not be compatible with the accessed server.

== The kubectl binary

The `kubectl` binary is provided as a means to support existing workflows and scripts for new {product-title} users coming from a standard Kubernetes environment, or for those who prefer to use the `kubectl` CLI. Existing users of `kubectl` can continue to use the binary to interact with Kubernetes primitives, with no changes required to the {product-title} cluster.

You can install the supported `kubectl` binary by following the steps to xref:../../cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.adoc#cli-installing-cli_cli-developer-commands[Install the OpenShift CLI]. The `kubectl` binary is included in the archive if you download the binary, or is installed when you install the CLI by using an RPM.
