= Criteria for user-defined labels and tags

Before configuring user-defined labels and tags for {gcp-full}, consider the importance of meeting the requirements for these tag and labels to ensure proper resource governance.

The following list details the requirements for user-defined labels:

* A label key and value must have a minimum of 1 character and can have a maximum of 63 characters.
* A label key and value must contain only lowercase letters, numeric characters, an underscore (`_`), and a dash (`-`).
* A label key must start with a lowercase letter.
* You can configure a maximum of 32 labels per resource. 
** Each resource has a maximum of 64 labels, where {product-title} reserves 32 labels for internal use.

The following list details the requirements for user-defined tags:

* Tag key and tag value must already exist. {product-title} does not create the key and the value.
* A tag `parentID` can be either `OrganizationID` or `ProjectID`:
** `OrganizationID` must consist of decimal numbers without leading zeros.
** `ProjectID` must be 6 to 30 characters in length, that includes only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
** `ProjectID` must start with a letter, and cannot end with a hyphen.
* A tag key must contain only uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric characters, a hyphen (`-`), an underscore (`_`), and a period (`.`).
* A tag value must contain only uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric characters and any of the following characters:
** A colon (`:`)
** A comma (`,`)
** A curly braces (`{}`)
** A hyphen (`-`)
** A parentheses (`()`)
** A percent sign (`%`)
** A plus (`+`)
** A pound sign (`$`)
** A space.
** A square braces (`[]`)
** An ampersand (`&`)
** An asterisk (`*`)
** An at sign (`@`)
** An equals sign (`=`)
** An underscore (`_`)
** A period (`.`)
* A tag key and value must begin and end with an alphanumeric character.
* Tag value must be one of the predefined values for the key.
* You can configure a maximum of 50 tags.
* Do not define a tag key with the same value as any of the existing tag keys that get inherited from the parent resource.
