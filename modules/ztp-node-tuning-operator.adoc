= Node Tuning Operator

The Node Tuning Operator provides the ability to enable advanced node performance tunings on a set of nodes.

{product-title} provides a Node Tuning Operator to implement automatic tuning to achieve low latency performance for {product-title} applications. The cluster administrator uses this performance profile configuration that makes it easier to make these changes in a more reliable way.

The administrator can specify updating the kernel to `rt-kernel`, reserving CPUs for management workloads, and using CPUs for running the workloads.

[NOTE]
====
In earlier versions of {product-title}, the Performance Addon Operator was used to implement automatic tuning to achieve low latency performance for OpenShift applications. In {product-title} 4.11, these functions are part of the Node Tuning Operator.
