= Scanning images by using secured clusters

To scan images by using the secured clusters instead of the Central services, you can use the delegated image scanning feature.

A new delegated scanning configuration specifies the registries from which you can delegate image scans. For images that Sensor observes, you can use the delegated registry configuration to delegate scans from no registries, all registries, or specific registries.

To enable delegation of scans by using the `roxctl` CLI, Jenkins plugin, or API, you must also specify a destination cluster and source registry.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed Scanner in the secured cluster to scan images.

[NOTE]
====
Enabling Scanner is supported on {ocp} and Kubernetes secured clusters.
====

.Procedure

. In the {product-title-short} portal, click *Platform Configuration -> Clusters*.
. In the *Clusters* view header, click *Delegated scanning*.
. In the *Delegated Image Scanning* page, provide the following information:

** *Delegate scanning for*: To choose the scope of the image delegation, select one of the following options:
*** *None*: The default option. This option specifies that the secured clusters do _not_ scan any images, except for images from the integrated OpenShift image registry.
*** *All registries*: This option indicates that the secured clusters scan all the images.
*** *Specified registries*: This option specifies the images that secured clusters should scan based on the registries list.

** *Select default cluster to delegate to*: From the drop-down list, select the name of the default cluster. The default cluster processes the scan requests coming from the command-line interface (CLI) and API. This is optional and you can select `None` if required.

** Optional: To specify the source registry and destination cluster details, click *Add registry*. 
+
For example, specify the source registry as `example.com`, and select `remote` from the drop-down list for the destination cluster. You can add more than one source registry and destination cluster if required.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You can select the destination cluster as `None` if the scan requests are not coming from the CLI and API. 
====

. Click *Save*.

Image integrations are now synchronized between Central and Sensor, and Sensor captures pull secrets from each namespace. Sensor then uses these credentials to authenticate to the image registries.
