=  Securing inputs during builds

In some scenarios, build operations require credentials to access dependent
resources, but it is undesirable for those credentials to be available in the
final application image produced by the build. You can define input secrets for
this purpose.

For example, when building a Node.js application, you can set up your private
mirror for Node.js modules. In order to download modules from that private
mirror, you must supply a custom `.npmrc` file for the build that contains
a URL, user name, and password. For security reasons, you do not want to expose
your credentials in the application image.

Using this example scenario, you can add an input secret to a new `BuildConfig` object:

. Create the secret, if it does not exist:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create secret generic secret-npmrc --from-file=.npmrc=~/.npmrc
----
+
This creates a new secret named `secret-npmrc`, which contains the base64
encoded content of the `~/.npmrc` file.

. Add the secret to the `source` section in the existing `BuildConfig` object:
+
[source,yaml]
----
source:
  git:
    uri: https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex.git
  secrets:
  - destinationDir: .
    secret:
      name: secret-npmrc
----

. To include the secret in a new `BuildConfig` object, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-build \
    openshift/nodejs-010-centos7~https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex.git \
    --build-secret secret-npmrc
----
