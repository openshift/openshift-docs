= About Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing

{product-title} supports BGP routing through FRRouting (FRR), a free, open source internet routing protocol suite for Linux, UNIX, and similar operating systems. FRR-K8s is a Kubernetes-based daemon set that exposes a subset of the FRR API in a Kubernetes-compliant manner. As a cluster administrator, you can use the `FRRConfiguration` custom resource (CR) to access FRR services.

[id="supported-platforms_{context}"]
== Supported platforms

BGP routing is supported on the following infrastructure types:

- Bare metal

BGP routing requires that you have properly configured BGP for your network provider. Outages or misconfigurations of your network provider might cause disruptions to your cluster network.

[id="considerations-for-use-with-the-metallb-operator_{context}"]
== Considerations for use with the MetalLB Operator

The MetalLB Operator is installed as an add-on to the cluster. Deployment of the MetalLB Operator automatically enables FRR-K8s as an additional routing capability provider and uses the FRR-K8s daemon installed by this feature.

Before upgrading to 4.18, any existing `FRRConfiguration` in the `metallb-system` namespace not managed by the MetalLB operator (added by a cluster administrator or any other component) needs to be copied to the `openshift-frr-k8s` namespace manually, creating the namespace if necessary.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are using the MetalLB Operator and there are existing `FRRConfiguration` CRs in the `metallb-system` namespace created by cluster administrators or third-party cluster components other than MetalLB Operator, you must:

- Ensure that these existing `FRRConfiguration` CRs are copied to the `openshift-frr-k8s` namespace.
- Ensure that the third-party cluster components use the new namespace for the `FRRConfiguration` CRs that they create.

[id="cluster-network-operator_{context}"]
== Cluster Network Operator configuration

The Cluster Network Operator API exposes the following API field to configure BGP routing:

- `spec.additionalRoutingCapabilities`: Enables deployment of the FRR-K8s daemon for the cluster, which can be used independently of route advertisements. When enabled, the FRR-K8s daemon is deployed on all nodes.

[id="bgp-routing-custom-resources_{context}"]
== BGP routing custom resources

The following custom resources are used to configure BGP routing:

`FRRConfiguration`::
This custom resource defines the FRR configuration for the BGP routing. This CR is namespaced.
