= Configuring traffic management

Controlling the flow of traffic and API calls between services is one of the key features of {ProductName}. Some services in your service mesh may need to communicate within the mesh and others may need to be hidden. Manage the traffic to hide specific backend services, expose services, create testing or versioning deployments, or add a security layer on a set of services.
