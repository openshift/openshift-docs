= Create an identity-based IAM policy

You can create an identity-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that denies access to all AWS actions when the request originates from an IP address other than Red{nbsp}Hat provided IPs.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the see link:https://aws.amazon.com/console/[AWS Management Console] with the permissions required to create and modify IAM policies.

.Procedure

. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS account credentials.
. Navigate to the IAM service.
. In the IAM console, select *Policies* from the left navigation menu.
. Click *Create policy*.
. Select the *JSON* tab to define the policy using JSON format.
. To get the IP addresses that you need to enter into the JSON policy document, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ocm get /api/clusters_mgmt/v1/trusted_ip_addresses
----
+
[NOTE]
====
These IP addresses are not permanent and are subject to change. You must continuously review the API output and make the necessary updates in the JSON policy document.
====
+
. Copy and paste the following `policy_document.json` file into the editor:
+
[source,json]
----
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "NotIpAddress": {
                    "aws:SourceIp": []
                },
                "Bool": {
                    "aws:ViaAWSService": "false"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
----
+
. Copy and paste all of the IP addresses, which you got in Step 6, into the `"aws:SourceIp": []` array in your `policy_document.json` file.
. Click *Review and create*.
. Provide a name and description for the policy, and review the details for accuracy.
. Click *Create policy* to save the policy.

[NOTE]
====
The condition key `aws:ViaAWSService` must be set to false to enable subsequent calls to succeed based on the initial call. For example, if you make an initial call to `aws ec2 describe-instances`, all subsequent calls made within the AWS API server to retrieve information about the EBS volumes attached to the ec2 instance will fail if the condition key `aws:ViaAWSService` is not set to false. The subsequent calls would fail because they would originate from AWS IP addresses, which are not included in the AllowList.
