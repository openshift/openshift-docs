USER root
# Copy entitlements
COPY ./etc-pki-entitlement /etc/pki/entitlement
# Copy repository configuration
COPY ./yum.repos.d /etc/yum.repos.d
# Delete /etc/rhsm-host to use entitlements from the build container
RUN rm /etc/rhsm-host && \
    # yum repository info provided by Satellite
    yum -y update && \
    yum -y install <rpms> && \
    # Remove entitlements
    rm -rf /etc/pki/entitlement
