= Docker builds using Satellite subscriptions

Docker strategy builds can use Satellite repositories to install subscription
content.

.Prerequisites

The entitlement keys and Satellite repository configurations must be added as
build inputs.

.Procedure

Use the following as an example *_Dockerfile_* to install content with
Satellite:

----
FROM registry.redhat.io/rhel7:latest
USER root
# Copy entitlements
COPY ./etc-pki-entitlement /etc/pki/entitlement
# Copy repository configuration
COPY ./yum.repos.d /etc/yum.repos.d
# Delete /etc/rhsm-host to use entitlements from the build container
RUN rm /etc/rhsm-host && \
    # yum repository info provided by Satellite
    yum -y update && \
    yum -y install <rpms> && \
    # Remove entitlements
    rm -rf /etc/pki/entitlement
# OpenShift requires images to run as non-root by default
USER 1001
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash"]
