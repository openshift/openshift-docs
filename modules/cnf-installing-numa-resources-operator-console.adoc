= Installing the NUMA Resources Operator using the web console

As a cluster administrator, you can install the NUMA Resources Operator using the web console.

.Procedure

. Create a namespace for the NUMA Resources Operator:

.. In the {product-title} web console, click *Administration* -> *Namespaces*.

.. Click *Create Namespace*, enter `openshift-numaresources` in the *Name* field, and then click *Create*.

. Install the NUMA Resources Operator:

.. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

.. Choose *numaresources-operator* from the list of available Operators, and then click *Install*.

.. In the *Installed Namespaces* field, select the `openshift-numaresources` namespace, and then click *Install*.

. Optional: Verify that the NUMA Resources Operator installed successfully:

.. Switch to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page.

.. Ensure that *NUMA Resources Operator* is listed in the `openshift-numaresources` namespace with a *Status* of *InstallSucceeded*.

[NOTE]
====
During installation an Operator might display a *Failed* status. If the installation later succeeds with an *InstallSucceeded* message, you can ignore the *Failed* message.
====

If the Operator does not appear as installed, to troubleshoot further:
+
* Go to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page and inspect the *Operator Subscriptions* and *Install Plans* tabs for any failure or errors under *Status*.
* Go to the *Workloads* -> *Pods* page and check the logs for pods in the `default` project.
