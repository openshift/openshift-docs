= {product-title}-specific guidelines
The following are guidelines that apply when creating container images specifically
for use on {product-title}.
ifdef::openshift-online[]
[discrete]
== Privileges and volume builds

container images cannot be built using the `VOLUME` directive in the `DOCKERFILE`.
Images using a read/write file system must use persistent volumes or
`emptyDir` volumes instead of local storage. Instead of specifying a volume in
the Dockerfile, specify a directory for local storage and mount either a
persistent volume or `emptyDir` volume to that directory when deploying the pod.
endif::[]

[discrete]
== Enable images for source-to-image (S2I)

For images that are intended to run application code provided by a third party,
such as a Ruby image designed to run Ruby code provided by a developer, you can
enable your image to work with the
https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[Source-to-Image (S2I)]  build tool.
S2I is a framework which makes it easy to write images that take application
source code as an input and produce a new image that runs the assembled
application as output.

For example, this https://github.com/sclorg/s2i-python-container[Python image]
defines S2I scripts for building various versions of Python applications.

[id="use-uid_{context}"]
== Support arbitrary user ids

By default, {product-title} runs containers using an arbitrarily assigned user
ID. This provides additional security against processes escaping the container
due to a container engine vulnerability and thereby achieving escalated
permissions on the host node.

For an image to support running as an arbitrary user, directories and files that
may be written to by processes in the image should be owned by the root group
and be read/writable by that group. Files to be executed should also have group
execute permissions.

Adding the following to your Dockerfile sets the directory and file permissions
to allow users in the root group to access them in the built image:

----
RUN chgrp -R 0 /some/directory && \
    chmod -R g=u /some/directory
----

Because the container user is always a member of the root group, the container
user can read and write these files.

[WARNING]
====
Care must be taken when altering the directories and file permissions of
sensitive areas of a container (no different than to a normal system).

If applied to sensitive areas, such as `/etc/passwd`, this can allow the
modification of such files by unintended users potentially exposing the
container or host. CRI-O supports the insertion of random user IDs into the
container's `/etc/passwd`, so changing it's permissions should never be required.
====

In addition, the processes running in the container must not listen on
privileged ports (ports below 1024), since they are not running as a
privileged user.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
If your S2I image does not include a *USER* declaration with a numeric user,
your builds will fail by default. In order to allow images that use either named
users or the root (*0*) user to build in {product-title}, you can add the
project's builder service account
(*system:serviceaccount:<your-project>:builder*) to the *privileged* security
context constraint (SCC). Alternatively, you can allow all images to
run as any user.

[id="use-services_{context}"]
== Use services for inter-image communication

For cases where your image needs to communicate with a service provided by
another image, such as a web front end image that needs to access a database
image to store and retrieve data, your image should consume an {product-title}
service.
Services provide a static endpoint for access which does not change as
containers are stopped, started, or moved. In addition, services provide load
balancing for requests.

[discrete]
== Provide common libraries

For images that are intended to run application code provided by a third party,
ensure that your image contains commonly used libraries for your platform. In
particular, provide database drivers for common databases used with your
platform. For example, provide JDBC drivers for MySQL and PostgreSQL if you are
creating a Java framework image. Doing so prevents the need for common
dependencies to be downloaded during application assembly time, speeding up
application image builds. It also simplifies the work required by application
developers to ensure all of their dependencies are met.

[discrete]
[id="use-env-vars_{context}"]
== Use environment variables for configuration

Users of your image should be able to configure it without having to create a
downstream image based on your image. This means that the runtime configuration
should be handled using environment variables. For a simple configuration, the
running process can consume the environment variables directly. For a more
complicated configuration or for runtimes which do not support this, configure
the runtime by defining a template configuration file that is processed during
startup. During this processing, values supplied using environment variables can
be substituted into the configuration file or used to make decisions about what
options to set in the configuration file.

It is also possible and recommended to pass secrets such as certificates and
keys into the container using environment variables. This ensures that the
secret values do not end up committed in an image and leaked into a container image
registry.

Providing environment variables allows consumers of your image to customize
behavior, such as database settings, passwords, and performance tuning, without
having to introduce a new layer on top of your image. Instead, they can simply
define environment variable values when defining a pod and change those settings
without rebuilding the image.

For extremely complex scenarios, configuration can also be supplied using
volumes that would be mounted into the container at runtime. However, if you
elect to do it this way you must ensure that your image provides clear error
messages on startup when the necessary volume or configuration is not present.

This topic is related to the Using Services for Inter-image
Communication topic in that configuration like datasources should be defined in
terms of environment variables that provide the service endpoint information.
This allows an application to dynamically consume a datasource service that is
defined in the {product-title} environment without modifying the application
image.

In addition, tuning should be done by inspecting the *cgroups* settings
for the container. This allows the image to tune itself to the available memory,
CPU, and other resources. For example, Java-based images should tune their heap
based on the *cgroup* maximum memory parameter to ensure they do not
exceed the limits and get an out-of-memory error.

in containers:

== Set image metadata

Defining image metadata helps {product-title} better consume your container images,
allowing {product-title} to create a better experience for developers using your
image. For example, you can add metadata to provide helpful descriptions of your
image, or offer suggestions on other images that may also be needed.

[discrete]
== Clustering

You must fully understand what it means to run multiple instances of your image.
In the simplest case, the load balancing function of a service handles routing
traffic to all instances of your image.  However, many frameworks must share
information in order to perform leader election or failover state; for example,
in session replication.

Consider how your instances accomplish this communication when running in
{product-title}. Although pods can communicate directly with each other, their
IP addresses change anytime the pod starts, stops, or is moved. Therefore, it is
important for your clustering scheme to be dynamic.

[discrete]
== Logging

It is best to send all logging to standard out. {product-title} collects
standard out from containers and sends it to the centralized logging service
where it can be viewed. If you must separate log content, prefix the output
with an appropriate keyword, which makes it possible to filter the messages.

If your image logs to a file, users must use manual operations to enter the
running container and retrieve or view the log file.

[discrete]
== Liveness and readiness probes

Document example liveness and readiness probes that can be used with your image. These probes will allow
users to deploy your image with confidence that traffic will not be routed to
the container until it is prepared to handle it, and that the container will be
restarted if the process gets into an unhealthy state.

[discrete]
== Templates

Consider providing an example template with
your image. A template will give users an easy way to quickly get your image
deployed with a working configuration. Your template should include the
liveness and readiness probes you documented with the image, for completeness.
