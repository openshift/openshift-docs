= About scaling a user-provisioned cluster with the Bare Metal Operator

You can scale user-provisioned infrastructure clusters by using the Bare Metal Operator (BMO) and other metal3 components. User-provisioned infrastructure installations do not feature the Machine API Operator. The Machine API Operator typically manages the lifecycle of bare-metal hosts in a cluster. However, it is possible to use the BMO and other metal3 components to scale nodes in user-provisioned clusters without requiring the Machine API Operator.
