[id="rosa-aws-policy-provisioned_{context}"]
= Provisioned AWS Infrastructure


This is an overview of the provisioned Amazon Web Services (AWS) components on a deployed {product-title} (ROSA) cluster. For a more detailed listing of all provisioned AWS components, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/[OpenShift Container Platform documentation].

[id="rosa-ec2-instances_{context}"]
== EC2 instances

AWS EC2 instances are required for deploying the control plane and data plane functions of ROSA in the AWS public cloud.

Instance types can vary for control plane and infrastructure nodes, depending on the worker node count. At a minimum, the following EC2 instances will be deployed:

- Three `m5.2xlarge` control plane nodes
- Two `r5.xlarge` infrastructure nodes
- Two `m5.xlarge` customizable worker nodes

For further guidance on worker node counts, see the information about initial planning considerations in the "Limits and scalability" topic listed in the "Additional resources" section of this page.

[id="rosa-ebs-storage_{context}"]
== Amazon Elastic Block Store storage

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) block storage is used for both local node storage and persistent volume storage.

Volume requirements for each EC2 instance:

- Control Plane Volume
* Size: 350GB
* Type: io1
* Input/Output Operations Per Second: 1000

- Infrastructure Volume
* Size: 300GB
* Type: gp3
* Input/Output Operations Per Second: 900

- Worker Volume
* Size: 300GB
* Type: gp3
* Input/Output Operations Per Second: 900

[NOTE]
====
Clusters deployed before the release of {OCP} 4.11 use gp2 type storage by default.
====

[id="rosa-elastic-load-balancers_{context}"]
== Elastic Load Balancing

Up to two Network Load Balancers for API and up to two Classic Load Balancers for application router. For more information, see the link:https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/features/#Details_for_Elastic_Load_Balancing_Products[ELB documentation for AWS].

[id="rosa-s3-storage_{context}"]
== S3 storage
The image registry is backed by AWS S3 storage. Pruning of resources is performed regularly to optimize S3 usage and cluster performance.

[NOTE]
====
Two buckets are required with a typical size of 2TB each.
====

[id="rosa-vpc_{context}"]
== VPC
Customers should expect to see one VPC per cluster. Additionally, the VPC will need the following configurations:

* *Subnets*: Two subnets for a cluster with a single availability zone, or six subnets for a cluster with multiple availability zones.
+
[NOTE]
====
A *public subnet* connects directly to the internet through an internet gateway. A *private subnet* connects to the internet through a network address translation (NAT) gateway.
====
+ 
* *Route tables*: One route table per private subnet, and one additional table per cluster.

* *Internet gateways*: One Internet Gateway per cluster.

* *NAT gateways*: One NAT Gateway per public subnet.

[id="rosa-security-groups_{context}"]
== Security groups

AWS security groups provide security at the protocol and port access level; they are associated with EC2 instances and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancers. Each security group contains a set of rules that filter traffic coming in and out of one or more EC2 instances. You must ensure the ports required for the OpenShift installation are open on your network and configured to allow access between hosts.

[id="rosa-security-groups-custom_{context}"]
=== Additional custom security groups
When you create a cluster using an existing non-managed VPC, you can add additional custom security groups during cluster creation. Custom security groups are subject to the following limitations:

* You must create the custom security groups in AWS before you create the cluster. For more information, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html[Amazon EC2 security groups for Linux instances].
* You must associate the custom security groups with the VPC that the cluster will be installed into. Your custom security groups cannot be associated with another VPC.
* You might need to request additional quota for your VPC if you are adding additional custom security groups. For information on AWS quota requirements for ROSA, see _Required AWS service quotas_ in _Prepare your environment_. For information on requesting an AWS quota increase, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html[Requesting a quota increase].
