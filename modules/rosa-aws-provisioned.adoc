[id="rosa-aws-policy-provisioned_{context}"]
= Provisioned AWS Infrastructure

This is an overview of the provisioned {AWS} components on a deployed {product-title} (ROSA) cluster.

[id="rosa-ec2-instances_{context}"]
== EC2 instances

AWS EC2 instances are required to deploy
ifndef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
the control plane and data plane functions for
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
{product-title}.

ifndef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
Instance types can vary for control plane and infrastructure nodes, depending on the worker node count.

At a minimum, the following EC2 instances are deployed:

* Three `m5.2xlarge` control plane nodes
* Two `r5.xlarge` infrastructure nodes
* Two `m5.xlarge` worker nodes
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]

ifdef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
At a minimum, two `m5.xlarge` EC2 instances are deployed for use as worker nodes.
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]

The instance type shown for worker nodes is the default value, but you can customize the instance type for worker nodes according to the needs of your workload.

ifndef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
For further guidance on worker node counts, see the information about initial planning considerations in the "Limits and scalability" topic listed in the "Additional resources" section of this page.
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]

[id="rosa-ebs-storage_{context}"]
== Amazon Elastic Block Store storage

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) block storage is used for both local node storage and persistent volume storage. The following values are the default size of the local, ephemeral storage provisioned for each EC2 instance.

Volume requirements for each EC2 instance:

ifndef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]

* Control Plane Volume
** Size: 350GB
** Type: gp3
** Input/Output Operations Per Second: 1000

* Infrastructure Volume
** Size: 300GB
** Type: gp3
** Input/Output Operations Per Second: 900

endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]

* Worker Volume
** Default size: 300GB
ifndef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
** Minimum size: 128GB
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
ifndef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
** Minimum size: 75GB
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
** Type: gp3
** Input/Output Operations Per Second: 900

ifndef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
[NOTE]
====
Clusters deployed before the release of {OCP} 4.11 use gp2 type storage by default.

endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]

[id="rosa-elastic-load-balancers_{context}"]
== Elastic Load Balancing
ifndef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
Each cluster can use up to two Classic Load Balancers for application router and up to two Network Load Balancers for API.
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
ifdef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
By default, one Network Load Balancer is created for use by the default ingress controller. You can create additional load balancers of the following types according to the needs of your workload:

* Classic Load Balancers
* Network Load Balancers
* Application Load Balancers

endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
For more information, see the link:https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/features/#Details_for_Elastic_Load_Balancing_Products[ELB documentation for AWS].

[id="rosa-s3-storage_{context}"]
== S3 storage
The image registry is backed by AWS S3 storage. Resources Pruning of resources is performed regularly to optimize S3 usage and cluster performance.

//TODO OSDOCS-11789: Confirm that this is still valid
[NOTE]
====
Two buckets are required with a typical size of 2TB each.
====

[id="rosa-vpc_{context}"]
== VPC

Configure your VPC according to the following requirements:

* *Subnets*: Two subnets for a cluster with a single availability zone, or six subnets for a cluster with multiple availability zones.
+
Red{nbsp}Hat strongly recommends using unique subnets for each cluster. Sharing subnets between multiple clusters is not recommended.
+
[NOTE]
====
A *public subnet* connects directly to the internet through an internet gateway. A *private subnet* connects to the internet through a network address translation (NAT) gateway.
====

* *Route tables*: One route table per private subnet, and one additional table per cluster.

* *Internet gateways*: One Internet Gateway per cluster.

* *NAT gateways*: One NAT Gateway per public subnet.

[id="rosa-security-groups_{context}"]
== Security groups

AWS security groups provide security at the protocol and port access level; they are associated with EC2 instances and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancers. Each security group contains a set of rules that filter traffic coming in and out of one or more EC2 instances.

Ensure that the ports required for cluster installation and operation are open on your network and configured to allow access between hosts. The requirements for the default security groups are listed in xref:required-secgroup-ports_{context}[Required ports for default security groups].

[id="rosa-security-groups-custom_{context}"]
=== Additional custom security groups
ifndef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
When you create a cluster using an existing non-managed VPC, you
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
ifdef::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
You
endif::openshift-rosa-hcp[]
can add additional custom security groups during cluster creation. Custom security groups are subject to the following limitations:

* You must create the custom security groups in AWS before you create the cluster. For more information, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html[Amazon EC2 security groups for Linux instances].
* You must associate the custom security groups with the VPC that the cluster will be installed into. Your custom security groups cannot be associated with another VPC.
* You might need to request additional quota for your VPC if you are adding additional custom security groups. For information on AWS quota requirements for ROSA, see _Required AWS service quotas_ in _Prepare your environment_. For information on requesting an AWS quota increase, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html[Requesting a quota increase].
