= High availability For ExternalIP

[role="_abstract"]
High availability for `ExternalIP` in non-cloud clusters of {product-title} combines IP failover with `ExternalIP` auto-assignment to ensure services remain accessible when nodes fail. You can configure this by using the same CIDR range for both `ExternalIP` auto-assignment and IP failover.

To configure high availability for `ExternalIP`, you can specify a `spec.ExternalIP.autoAssignCIDRs` range of the cluster network configuration, and then use the same range in creating the IP failover configuration.

Because IP failover can support up to a maximum of 255 VIPs for the entire cluster, the `spec.ExternalIP.autoAssignCIDRs` must be `/24` or smaller.
