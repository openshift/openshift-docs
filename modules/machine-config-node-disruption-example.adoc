= Example node disruption policies

The following example `MachineConfiguration` objects contain a node disruption policy.

[TIP]
====
A `MachineConfiguration` object and a `MachineConfig` object are different objects. A `MachineConfiguration` object is a singleton object in the MCO namespace that contains configuration parameters for the MCO operator. A `MachineConfig` object defines changes that are applied to a machine config pool.
====

The following example `MachineConfiguration` object shows no user defined policies. The default node disruption policy values are shown in the `status` stanza.

----

The default node disruption policy does not contain a policy for changes to the `/etc/containers/registries.conf.d` file. This is because both {product-title} and {op-system-base-full} use the `registries.conf.d` file to specify aliases for image short names. It is recommended that you always pull an image by its fully-qualified name. This is particularly important with public registries, because the image might not deploy if the public registry requires authentication. You can create a user-defined policy to use with the `/etc/containers/registries.conf.d` file, if you need to use image short names.

In the following example, when changes are made to the SSH keys, the MCO drains the cluster nodes, reloads the `crio.service`, reloads the systemd configuration, and restarts the `crio-service`.

In the following example, when changes are made to the `/etc/chrony.conf` file, the MCO restarts the `chronyd.service` on the cluster nodes. If files are added to or modified in the `/var/run` directory, the MCO applies the changes with no further action.

In the following example, when changes are made to the `auditd.service`	systemd unit, the MCO drains the cluster nodes, reloads the `crio.service`, reloads the systemd manager configuration, and restarts the `crio.service`.

In the following example, when changes are made to the `registries.conf` file, such as by editing an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` (ICSP) object, the MCO does not drain or reboot the nodes and applies the changes with no further action.
