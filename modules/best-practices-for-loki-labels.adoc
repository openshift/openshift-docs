= Best practices for Loki labels

Labels in Loki are the keyspace on which Loki shards incoming data. They are also the index used for finding logs at query-time. You can optimize query performance by properly using labels.

Consider the following criteria when creating labels:

* Labels should describe infrastructure. This could include regions, clusters, servers, applications, namespaces, or environments.

* Labels are long-lived. Label values should generate logs perpetually, or at least for several hours.

* Labels are intuitive for querying.
