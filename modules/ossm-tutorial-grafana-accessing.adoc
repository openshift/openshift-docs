= Accessing the Grafana dashboard

The Grafana dashboard's web-based interface lets you visualize your metrics data.

.Prerequisites

* {product-title} 3.11 or higher installed.
* {SMProductName} {SMProductVersion} installed.
* `Bookinfo` demonstration application installed.

.Procedure
. A route to access the Grafana dashboard already exists. In this example, `istio-system` is the name of the {SMProductShortName} control plane project. Query for details of the route:
+
----
  $ export GRAFANA_URL=$(oc get route -n istio-system grafana -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
----
+
. Launch a browser and navigate to navigate to `http://<GRAFANA_URL>`.  You see Grafana's home screen, as shown in the following figure:

+
. From the menu in the upper-left corner, select *Istio Mesh Dashboard* to see Istio mesh metrics.

+
. Generate some traffic by accessing the Bookinfo application:
+
----
$ curl -o /dev/null http://<GATEWAY_URL>/productpage
----
+
The dashboard reflects the traffic through the mesh, similar to the following figure:
+

+
. To see detailed metrics for a Service, click a Service name in the *Service* column. The Service dashboard resembles the following figure:
+

+
Note that *TCP Bandwidth* metrics are empty, because Bookinfo only uses http-based Services. The dashboard also displays metrics for Workloads that call the *Client Workloads* Service and for Workloads that process requests from the *Service Workloads*. You can switch to a different Service or filter metrics by client and Service Workloads by using the menus at the top of the dashboard.
+
. To switch to the Workloads dashboard, click *Istio Workload Dashboard* on the menu in the upper-left corner. You will see a screen resembling the following figure:
+
image::ossm-grafana-workloads.png[]
+
This dashboard shows Workload metrics and metrics for client (inbound) and Service (outbound) Workloads. You can switch to a different Workload; to filter metrics by inbound or outbound Workloads, use the menus at the top of the dashboard.
