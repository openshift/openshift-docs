= In-built permissions for cluster configuration

[role="_abstract"]
By default, the Argo CD instance has permissions to manage specific cluster-scoped resources such as cluster Operators, optional OLM Operators and user management. 

[NOTE]
====
* Argo CD does not have `cluster-admin` permissions.
* You can extend the permissions bound to any Argo CD instances managed by the {gitops-shortname} Operator. However, you must not modify the permission resources, such as roles or cluster roles created by the {gitops-shortname} Operator, because the Operator might reconcile them back to their initial state. Instead, create dedicated role and cluster role objects and bind them to the appropriate service account that the application controller uses.
