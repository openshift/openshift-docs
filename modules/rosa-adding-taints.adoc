= Adding taints to a machine pool

You can add taints for compute (also known as worker) nodes in a machine pool to control which pods are scheduled to them. When you apply a taint to a machine pool, the scheduler cannot place a pod on the nodes in the pool unless the pod specification includes a toleration for the taint.
ifdef::openshift-rosa,openshift-rosa-hcp[]
Taints can be added to a machine pool using {cluster-manager-first} or the {product-title} (ROSA) CLI, `rosa`.

[NOTE]
====
A cluster must have at least one machine pool that does not contain any taints.

.Procedure
. Navigate to {cluster-manager-url} and select your cluster.
. Under the *Machine pools* tab, click the options menu {kebab} for the machine pool that you want to add a taint to.
. Select *Edit taints*.
. Add *Key* and *Value* entries for your taint.
. Select an *Effect* for your taint from the drop-down menu. Available options include `NoSchedule`, `PreferNoSchedule`, and `NoExecute`.
