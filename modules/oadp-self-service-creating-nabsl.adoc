= Creating a NonAdminBackupStorageLocation CR

You can create a `NonAdminBackupStorageLocation` (NABSL) custom resource (CR) in your authorized namespace. After the cluster administrator approves the NABSL CR request, you can use the NABSL CR in the `NonAdminBackup` CR spec.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the cluster as a namespace admin user.
* The cluster administrator has installed the {oadp-short} Operator.
* The cluster administrator has configured the `DataProtectionApplication` (DPA) CR to enable {oadp-short} Self-Service.
* The cluster administrator has created a namespace for you and has authorized you to operate from that namespace.

.Procedure

. Create a `Secret` CR by using the cloud credentials file content for your cloud provider. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create secret generic cloud-credentials -n test-nac-ns --from-file <cloud_key_name>=<cloud_credentials_file> # <1>
----
<1> In this example, the `Secret` name is `cloud-credentials` and the authorized namespace name is `test-nac-ns`. Replace `<cloud_key_name>` and `<cloud_credentials_file>` with your cloud key name and the cloud credentials file name, respectively.

. To create a `NonAdminBackupStorageLocation` CR, create a YAML manifest file with the following configuration:
+
.Example `NonAdminBackupStorageLocation` CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: NonAdminBackupStorageLocation
metadata:
  name: test-nabsl 
  namespace: test-nac-ns # <1>
spec: 
  backupStorageLocationSpec:
    config:
      profile: default
      region: <region_name> # <2>
    credential:
      key: cloud
      name: cloud-credentials
    objectStorage:
      bucket: <bucket_name> # <3>
      prefix: velero
    provider: aws  
----
<1> Specify the namespace you are authorized to operate from. For example, `test-nac-ns`.
<2> Replace `<region_name>` with a region name.
<3> Replace `<bucket_name>` with a bucket name.

. To apply the NABSL CR configuration, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <nabsl_cr_filename> # <1>
----
<1> Replace `<nabsl_cr_filename>` with the file name containing the NABSL CR configuration.


.Verification

. To verify that the NABSL CR is in the `New` phase and is pending administrator approval, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nabsl test-nabsl -o yaml
----
+
.Example output
