= Creating a NonAdminBackupStorageLocation CR

[role="_abstract"]
Create a `NonAdminBackupStorageLocation` (NABSL) custom resource (CR) to define backup storage locations in your authorized namespace. With this feature, you can store backups in a cloud storage that meets your application requirements.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the cluster as a namespace admin user.
* The cluster administrator has installed the {oadp-short} Operator.
* The cluster administrator has configured the `DataProtectionApplication` (DPA) CR to enable {oadp-short} Self-Service.
* The cluster administrator has created a namespace for you and has authorized you to operate from that namespace.

.Procedure

. Create a `Secret` CR by using the cloud credentials file content for your cloud provider. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create secret generic cloud-credentials -n test-nac-ns --from-file <cloud_key_name>=<cloud_credentials_file>
----
+
where:
+
`<cloud_key_name>`:: Specifies the cloud provider key name. In this example, the `Secret` name is `cloud-credentials` and the authorized namespace name is `test-nac-ns`.

`<cloud_credentials_file>`:: Specifies the cloud credentials file name.

. To create a `NonAdminBackupStorageLocation` CR, create a YAML manifest file with the following configuration:
+
.Example `NonAdminBackupStorageLocation` CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: NonAdminBackupStorageLocation
metadata:
  name: test-nabsl 
  namespace: test-nac-ns
spec:
  backupStorageLocationSpec:
    config:
      profile: default
      region: <region_name>
    credential:
      key: cloud
      name: cloud-credentials
    objectStorage:
      bucket: <bucket_name>
      prefix: velero
    provider: aws
----
+
where:
+
`namespace`:: Specifies the namespace you are authorized to operate from. For example, `test-nac-ns`.
`<region_name>`:: Specifies the region name for your cloud provider.
`<bucket_name>`:: Specifies the bucket name for storing backups.

+
. To apply the NABSL CR configuration, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <nabsl_cr_filename>
----
+
Replace `<nabsl_cr_filename>` with the file name containing the NABSL CR configuration.


.Verification

. To verify that the NABSL CR is in the `New` phase and is pending administrator approval, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nabsl test-nabsl -o yaml
----
+
.Example output

`message`:: Contains the `NonAdminBackupStorageLocationRequest approval pending` message.
`phase`:: Specifies the status of the phase. In this example, the phase is `New`.

. After the cluster administrator approves the `NonAdminBackupStorageLocationRequest` CR request, verify that the NABSL CR is successfully created by running the following command:

$ oc get nabsl test-nabsl -o yaml
