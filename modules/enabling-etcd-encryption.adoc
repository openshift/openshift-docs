= Enabling etcd encryption

You can enable etcd encryption to encrypt sensitive resources in your cluster.

[WARNING]
====
It is not recommended to take a backup of etcd until the initial encryption process is complete. If the encryption process has not completed, the backup might be only partially encrypted.
====

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Modify the API server object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit apiserver
----

. Set the `encryption` field type to `aescbc`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  encryption:
    type: aescbc <1>
----
<1> The `aescbc` type means that AES-CBC with PKCS#7 padding and a 32 byte key is used to perform the encryption.

. Save the file to apply the changes.
+
The encryption process starts. It can take 20 minutes or longer for this process to complete, depending on the size of your cluster.

. Verify that etcd encryption was successful.

.. Review the `Encrypted` status condition for the OpenShift API server to verify that its resources were successfully encrypted:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get openshiftapiserver -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="Encrypted")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'
----
+
The output shows `EncryptionCompleted` upon successful encryption:
+
[source,terminal]
----
EncryptionCompleted
All resources encrypted: routes.route.openshift.io, oauthaccesstokens.oauth.openshift.io, oauthauthorizetokens.oauth.openshift.io
----
+
If the output shows `EncryptionInProgress`, this means that encryption is still in progress. Wait a few minutes and try again.

.. Review the `Encrypted` status condition for the Kubernetes API server to verify that its resources were successfully encrypted:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get kubeapiserver -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="Encrypted")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'
----
+
The output shows `EncryptionCompleted` upon successful encryption:
+
[source,terminal]
----
EncryptionCompleted
All resources encrypted: secrets, configmaps
----
+
If the output shows `EncryptionInProgress`, this means that encryption is still in progress. Wait a few minutes and try again.
