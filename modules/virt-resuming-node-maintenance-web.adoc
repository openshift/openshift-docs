= Resuming a node from maintenance mode in the web console

Resume a node from maintenance mode using the Options menu {kebab} found 
on each node in the *Compute* -> *Nodes* list, or using the *Actions* control 
of the *Node Details* screen.

.Procedure

. In the {VirtProductName} console, click *Compute* -> *Nodes*.
. You can resume the node from this screen, which makes it easier to perform 
actions on multiple nodes in the one screen, or from the *Node Details* screen 
where you can view comprehensive details of the selected node:
** Click the Options menu {kebab} at the end of the node and select
*Stop Maintenance*.
** Click the node name to open the *Node Details* screen and click 
*Actions* -> *Stop Maintenance*.
. Click *Stop Maintenance* in the confirmation window. 

The node becomes schedulable, but virtual machine instances that were running on 
the node prior to maintenance will not automatically migrate back to this node.
