=== Creating a virtual machine from a template using the web console

Templates can be used to create virtual machines, removing the need to download a disk image for each virtual 
machine. The PVC created for the template is cloned, allowing you to 
change the resource parameters for each new virtual machine.

.Prerequisites

* A cluster running {product-title} 3.11 or newer
* {ProductName} version 1.3 or newer

.Procedure

. Ensure you are in the correct project. If not, click the `Project` drop-down 
menu and select the appropriate project or create a new one.
. Click the `Catalog` button on the side menu.
. Click the `Virtualization` tab to filter the catalog.
. Select the template and click `Next`.
. Enter the required parameters. For example: +
+
----
Add to Project: template-test
NAME: fedora-1
MEMORY: 2048Mi
CPU_CORES: 2
----

. Click `Next`.
. Choose whether or not to create a binding for the virtual machine. Bindings 
create a secret containing the necessary information for another application 
to use the virtual machine service. Bindings can also be added after the virtual 
machine has been created.
. Click `Create` to begin creating the virtual machine.

NOTE: Temporary pods with the generated names of `clone-source-pod-<random>` and `clone-target-pod-<random>`, 
are built, in the template project and the virtual machine project respectively, to handle the creation of the virtual machine and the corresponding PVC.
The PVC is given a generated name of `vm-<vm-name>-disk-01` or `vm-<vm-name>-dv-01`. Upon completion, the 
temporary pods are discarded and the virtual machine (`fedora-1` in the above example) 
is ready in a `Stopped` state.
