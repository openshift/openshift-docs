= About the API Audit Log

Audit works at the API server level, logging all requests coming to the server.
Each audit log contains two entries:

. The request line containing:
.. A Unique ID allowing to match the response line (see #2)
.. The source IP of the request
.. The HTTP method being invoked
.. The original user invoking the operation
.. The impersonated user for the operation (`self` meaning himself)
.. The impersonated group for the operation (`lookup` meaning user's group)
.. The namespace of the request or <none>
.. The URI as requested

. The response line containing:
.. The unique ID from #1
.. The response code

You can view logs for the master nodes for the {product-title} API server or the Kubernetes API server. 

Example output for the Kubelet API server:
