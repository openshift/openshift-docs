= Configuring a restorePVC for a Data Mover restore

A `restorePVC` is an intermediate PVC that is used to write data during the Data Mover restore operation.

You can configure the `restorePVC` in the `DataProtectionApplication` (DPA) object by using the `ignoreDelayBinding` field. Setting the `ignoreDelayBinding` field to `true` allows the restore operation to ignore the `WaitForFirstConsumer` binding mode. The data movement restore operation then creates the restore pod and provisions the associated volume to an arbitrary node. 

The `ignoreDelayBinding` setting is helpful in scenarios where multiple volume restores are happening in parallel. With the `ignoreDelayBinding` field set to `true`, the restore pods can be spread evenly to all nodes.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oadp-short} Operator.
* You have a created a Data Mover backup of an application.

.Procedure

* Configure the `restorePVC` section in the DPA as shown in the following example:
