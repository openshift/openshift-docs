= Understanding secrets

The `Secret` object type provides a mechanism to hold sensitive information such
as passwords, {product-title} client configuration files,
private source repository credentials, and so on. Secrets decouple sensitive
content from the pods. You can mount secrets into containers using a volume
plugin or the system can use secrets to perform actions on behalf of a pod.

Key properties include:

- Secret data can be referenced independently from its definition.
- Secret data volumes are backed by temporary file-storage facilities (tmpfs) and never come to rest on a node.
- Secret data can be shared within a namespace.

.YAML `Secret` object definition

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: test-secret
  namespace: my-namespace
type: Opaque <1>
data: <2>
  username: <username> <3>
  password: <password>
stringData: <4>
  hostname: myapp.mydomain.com <5>
----
<1> Indicates the structure of the secret's key names and values.
<2> The allowable format for the keys in the `data` field must meet the
guidelines in the *DNS_SUBDOMAIN* value in
link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.0.0/docs/design/identifiers.md[the
Kubernetes identifiers glossary].
<3> The value associated with keys in the `data` map must be base64 encoded.
<4> Entries in the `stringData` map are converted to base64
and the entry will then be moved to the `data` map automatically. This field
is write-only; the value will only be returned via the `data` field.
<5> The value associated with keys in the `stringData` map is made up of
plain text strings.

You must create a secret before creating the pods that depend on that secret.

When creating secrets:

- Create a secret object with secret data.
- Update the pod's service account to allow the reference to the secret.
- Create a pod, which consumes the secret as an environment variable or as a file
(using a `secret` volume).

== Types of secrets

The value in the `type` field indicates the structure of the secret's key names and values. The type can be used to
enforce the presence of user names and keys in the secret object. If you do not want validation, use the `opaque` type,
which is the default.

Specify one of the following types to trigger minimal server-side validation to ensure the presence of specific key names in the secret data:

* `kubernetes.io/basic-auth`: Use with Basic authentication
* `kubernetes.io/dockercfg`: Use as an image pull secret
* `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`: Use as an image pull secret
* `kubernetes.io/service-account-token`: Use to obtain a legacy service account API token
* `kubernetes.io/ssh-auth`: Use with SSH key authentication
* `kubernetes.io/tls`: Use with TLS certificate authorities

Specify `type: Opaque` if you do not want validation, which means the secret does not claim to conform to any convention for key names or values.
An _opaque_ secret, allows for unstructured `key:value` pairs that can contain arbitrary values.

[NOTE]
====
You can specify other arbitrary types, such as `example.com/my-secret-type`. These types are not enforced server-side,
but indicate that the creator of the secret intended to conform to the key/value requirements of that type.

== Secret data keys

Secret keys must be in a DNS subdomain.
