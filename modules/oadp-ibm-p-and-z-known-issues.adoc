= Known issue of OADP using {ibm-power-name} and {ibm-z-name} platforms

* Currently, there are backup method restrictions for {sno-caps} clusters deployed on {ibm-power-name} and {ibm-z-name} platforms. Only NFS storage is currently compatible with {sno-caps} clusters on these platforms. In addition, only the File System Backup (FSB) methods such as Kopia and Restic are supported for backup and restore operations. There is currently no workaround for this issue.
