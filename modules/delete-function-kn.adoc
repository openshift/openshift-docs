$ kn func delete [<function_name> -n <namespace> -p <path>]

** If the name or path of the function to delete is not specified, the current directory is searched for a `func.yaml` file that is used to determine the function to delete.
** If the namespace is not specified, it defaults to the `namespace` value in the `func.yaml` file.
