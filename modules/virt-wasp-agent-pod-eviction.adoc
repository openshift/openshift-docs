[id="virt-wasp-agent-pod-eviction_{context}"]
= Pod eviction conditions used by wasp-agent

The wasp agent manages pod eviction when the system is heavily loaded and nodes are at risk. Eviction is triggered if one of the following conditions is met:

High swap I/O traffic::

This condition is met when swap-related I/O traffic is excessively high. 
+
.Condition
[source,text]
----
averageSwapInPerSecond > maxAverageSwapInPagesPerSecond 
&&
averageSwapOutPerSecond > maxAverageSwapOutPagesPerSecond
----
+
By default, `maxAverageSwapInPagesPerSecond` and `maxAverageSwapOutPagesPerSecond` are set to 1000 pages. The default time interval for calculating the average is 30 seconds.

High swap utilization::

This condition is met when swap utilization is excessively high, causing the current virtual memory usage to exceed the factored threshold. The `NODE_SWAP_SPACE` setting in your `MachineConfig` object can impact this condition.
+
.Condition
[source,text]
----
nodeWorkingSet + nodeSwapUsage < totalNodeMemory + totalSwapMemory Ã— thresholdFactor

[id="environment-variables_{context}"]
== Environment variables

You can use the following environment variables to adjust the values used to calculate eviction conditions:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|*Environment variable* |*Function*
|`MAX_AVERAGE_SWAP_IN_PAGES_PER_SECOND`
|Sets the value of `maxAverageSwapInPagesPerSecond`.
|`MAX_AVERAGE_SWAP_OUT_PAGES_PER_SECOND`
|Sets the value of `maxAverageSwapOutPagesPerSecond`.
|`SWAP_UTILIZATION_THRESHOLD_FACTOR`
|Sets the `thresholdFactor` value used to calculate high swap utilization.
|`AVERAGE_WINDOW_SIZE_SECONDS`
|Sets the time interval for calculating the average swap usage.
