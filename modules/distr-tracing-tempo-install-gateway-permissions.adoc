= Configure tenants and permissions

Authentication and authorization is provided in the Tempo Gateway service. The authentication uses OpenShift OAuth and the Kubernetes `TokenReview` API. The authorization uses the Kubernetes `SubjectAccessReview` API.

To properly define tenants and manage their read and write access, the distributed tracing stack—built on the Red Hat distribution of OpenTelemetry and Tempo—requires a well-configured authorization setup. 

This setup relies on Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) through ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding. By default, no users are granted read or write permissions, ensuring a secure baseline until explicit configurations are defined.


You can install a Configure those permissionns from the *Administrator* view of the web console or using command line CLI.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as a cluster administrator with the `cluster-admin` role.
* For {product-dedicated}, you must be logged in using an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.

.Reading traces 

To grant users permission to read a specific tenant, follow these steps:

. Define desired tenant name and tenant Id. 
. Enable tenants to read traces by adding them to a `ClusterRole` and giving them read (get) permissions

.Sample of the read RBAC configuration that allows authenticated users to read the trace data of the `dev` and `prod` tenants

.Writing traces

To ingest traces, we must first install the OpenTelemetry Collector and configure it to use a properly authorized service account with the necessary permissions.

. Create a ServiceAccount to be used with OpenTelemetry Collector
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: otel-collector # <1>
  namespace: otel
----
. Grant the OpenTelemetry Collector write permissions by defining a Role with write permissions and  ClusterRoleBinding to attach the OpenTelemetry Collector ServiceAccount.

The following is a sample on how to write RBAC configuration that allows the `otel-collector` ServiceAccount to write the trace data for the `dev` tenant
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: tempostack-traces-write
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - 'tempo.grafana.com'
    resources: # <1>
      - dev
    resourceNames:
      - traces
    verbs:
      - 'create' # <2>
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: tempostack-traces
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: tempostack-traces-write
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: otel-collector # <3>
    namespace: otel
----
<1> Lists the tenants.
<2> The `create` value enables the write operation.
<3> The service account name for the client to use when exporting trace data. The client must send the service account token, `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`, as the bearer token header.
+
. Configure the OpenTelemetry collector by:
  * Adding the bearertokenauth extension and a valid token to the tracing pipeline service.
  * Add the desired tenant in the otlp/otlphttp exporters as the "X-Scope-OrgID" headers
  * Enable TLS with a valid certificate authority file.

Trace data can be sent to the Tempo instance from the OpenTelemetry Collector that uses the service account with RBAC for writing the data.
