= Project-level limits

To help control overcommit, you can set per-project resource limit ranges,
specifying memory and CPU limits and defaults for a project that overcommit
cannot exceed.

For information on project-level resource limits, see Additional Resources.

Alternatively, you can disable overcommitment for specific projects.
