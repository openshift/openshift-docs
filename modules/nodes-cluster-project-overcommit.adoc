To help control overcommit, you can set per-project resource limit ranges,
specifying memory and CPU limits and defaults for a project that overcommit
cannot exceed.

For information on project-level resource limits, see Additional resources.

Alternatively, you can disable overcommitment for specific projects.

In {product-title}, overcommitment of project-level resources is enabled by default.
If required by your use case, you can disable overcommitment on projects that are not managed by Red Hat.

For the list of projects that are managed by Red Hat and cannot be modified, see "Red Hat Managed resources" in _Support_.
