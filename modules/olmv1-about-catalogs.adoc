= About catalogs in OLM 1.0

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0 introduces the catalogd component to the OLM suite of microservices. Catalogd is a Kubernetes extension that unpacks file-based catalog content for on-cluster clients. Currently, catalogd unpacks catalog content that is packaged and distributed as container images. 

Catalogd helps customers discover installable content by hosting catalog metadata for Kubernetes extensions, such as Operators and controllers.
