= About catalogs in {olmv1}

You can discover installable content by querying a catalog for Kubernetes extensions, such as Operators and controllers, by using the catalogd component. Catalogd is a Kubernetes extension that unpacks catalog content for on-cluster clients and is part of the {olmv1-first} suite of microservices. Currently, catalogd unpacks catalog content that is packaged and distributed as container images.
