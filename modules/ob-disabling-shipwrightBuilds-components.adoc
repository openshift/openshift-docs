= Disabling ShipwrightBuilds components

[role="_abstract"]
You can disable the ShipwrightBuilds custom resource (CR). This action removes the `shipwright-build-controller` and `shipwright-build-webhook` pod from the `openshift-builds` namespace. It does not affect the Shared Resources Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver component or the `ShipwrightBuilds` custom resource definition (CRD).

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You are logged in to the {ocp-product-title} cluster as an administrator.
* You have installed the {builds-title}.

.Procedure

* Run the following command to disable the `shipwright-build-controller` and `shipwright-build-webhook` pods:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch openshiftbuild cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"shipwright":{"build":{"state":"Disabled"}}}}'
----
+
This command disables the `shipwright-build-controller` and `shipwright-build-webhook` pods but does not affect the `ShipwrightBuilds` CRD.

.Verification

* Run the following command to verify that the `shipwright-build-controller` and `shipwright-build-webhook` pods are disabled:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-builds
