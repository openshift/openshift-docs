= Creating a ClusterUserDefinedNetwork CR by using the web console

[role="_abstract"]
To implement isolated network segments with layer 2 connectivity in {product-title}, create a `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` custom resource (CR) by using the web console. Defining this resource ensures that your cluster workloads can communicate directly at the data link layer.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, creation of a `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CR with a `Layer3` topology is not supported when using the {product-title} web console.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the {product-title} web console as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.
* You have created a namespace and applied the `k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network` label.

.Procedure

. From the *Administrator* perspective, click *Networking* -> *UserDefinedNetworks*.

. Click *ClusterUserDefinedNetwork*.

. In the *Name* field, specify a name for the cluster-scoped UDN.

. Specify a value in the *Subnet* field.

. In the *Project(s) Match Labels* field, add the appropriate labels to select namespaces that the cluster UDN applies to.

. Click *Create*. The cluster-scoped UDN serves as the default primary network for pods located in namespaces that contain the labels that you specified in step 5.
