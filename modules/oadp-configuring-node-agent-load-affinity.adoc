= Configuring node agent load affinity

[role="_abstract"]
You can schedule the node agent pods on specific nodes by using the `spec.podConfig.nodeSelector` object of the `DataProtectionApplication` (DPA) custom resource (CR). 

See the following example in which you can schedule the node agent pods on nodes with the label `label.io/role: cpu-1` and `other-label.io/other-role: cpu-2`.

spec:
  configuration:
    nodeAgent:
      enable: true
      uploaderType: kopia
      podConfig:
        nodeSelector:
          label.io/role: cpu-1
          other-label.io/other-role: cpu-2
        ...

You can add more restrictions on the node agent pods scheduling by using the `nodeagent.loadAffinity` object in the DPA spec.

.Prerequisites

* You must be logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have installed the {oadp-short} Operator.
* You have configured the DPA CR.

.Procedure

* Configure the DPA spec `nodegent.loadAffinity` object as shown in the following example. 
+
In the example, you ensure that the node agent pods are scheduled only on nodes with the label `label.io/role: cpu-1` and the label `label.io/hostname` matching with either `node1` or `node2`.
