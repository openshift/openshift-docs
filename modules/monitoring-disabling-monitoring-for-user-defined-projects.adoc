= Disabling monitoring for user-defined projects

After enabling monitoring for user-defined projects, you can disable it again by setting `enableUserWorkload: false` in the cluster monitoring ConfigMap.

[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, you can remove `enableUserWorkload: true` to disable monitoring for user-defined projects.
====

.Procedure

. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` ConfigMap:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----
+
.. Set `enableUserWorkload:` to `false` under `data/config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    enableUserWorkload: false
----

. Save the file to apply the changes. Monitoring for user-defined projects is then disabled automatically.

. Check that the `prometheus-operator`, `prometheus-user-workload` and `thanos-ruler-user-workload` pods are terminated in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project. This might take a short while:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring get pod
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
No resources found in openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
----

[NOTE]
====
The `user-workload-monitoring-config` ConfigMap in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project is not automatically deleted when monitoring for user-defined projects is disabled. This is to preserve any custom configurations that you may have created in the ConfigMap.
