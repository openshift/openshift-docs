:_content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="insights-operator-configuring-sca_{context}"]
= Configuring simple content access import interval

You can configure how often the Insights Operator imports the simple content access entitlements using the `support` secret in the `openshift-config` namespace. The entitlement import normally occurs every eight hours, but you can shorten this interval if you update your simple content access configuration in Red Hat Subscription Management.

This procedure describes how to update the import interval to one hour. 

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as `cluster-admin`.
