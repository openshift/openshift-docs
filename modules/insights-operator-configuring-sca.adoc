:_content-type: PROCEDURE
[id="insights-operator-configuring-sca_{context}"]
= Configuring simple content access import interval

You can configure how often the Insights Operator imports the simple content access certificates using the `support` secret in the `openshift-config` namespace. The certificate import normally occurs every 8 hours, but you can shorten this interval if you update your simple content access configuration in Red Hat Subscription Management.

This procedure describes how to update the import interval to one hour. 

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as `cluster-admin`.
