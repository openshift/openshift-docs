= {product-title} installation overview

The {product-title} installation program offers you flexibility. You can use the installation program to deploy a cluster on infrastructure that the installation program provisions and the cluster maintains or deploy a cluster on infrastructure that you prepare and maintain.

These two basic types of {product-title} clusters are frequently called installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters and user-provisioned infrastructure clusters.

Both types of clusters have the following characteristics:

* Highly available infrastructure with no single points of failure is available by default
* Administrators maintain control over what updates are applied and when

You use the same installation program to deploy both types of clusters. The main assets generated by the installation program are the Ignition config files for the bootstrap, master, and worker machines. With these three configurations and correctly configured infrastructure, you can start an {product-title} cluster.

The {product-title} installation program uses a set of targets and dependencies to manage cluster installation. The installation program has a set of targets that it must achieve, and each target has a set of dependencies. Because each target is only concerned with its own dependencies, the installation program can act to achieve multiple targets in parallel. The ultimate target is a running cluster. By meeting dependencies instead of running commands, the installation program is able to recognize and use existing components instead of running the commands to create them again.

The following diagram shows a subset of the installation targets and dependencies:

After installation, each cluster machine uses {op-system-first} as the operating system. {op-system} is the immutable container host version of {op-system-base-full} and features a {op-system-base} kernel with SELinux enabled by default. It includes the `kubelet`, which is the Kubernetes node agent, and the CRI-O container runtime, which is optimized for Kubernetes.

Every control plane machine in an {product-title} {product-version} cluster must use {op-system}, which includes a critical first-boot provisioning tool called Ignition. This tool enables the cluster to configure the machines. Operating system updates are delivered as an Atomic OSTree repository that is embedded in a container image that is rolled out across the cluster by an Operator. Actual operating system changes are made in-place on each machine as an atomic operation by using rpm-ostree. Together, these technologies enable {product-title} to manage the operating system like it manages any other application on the cluster, via in-place upgrades that keep the entire platform up-to-date. These in-place updates can reduce the burden on operations teams.

If you use {op-system} as the operating system for all cluster machines, the cluster manages all aspects of its components and machines, including the operating system. Because of this, only the installation program and the Machine Config Operator can change machines. The installation program uses Ignition config files to set the exact state of each machine, and the Machine Config Operator completes more changes to the machines, such as the application of new certificates or keys, after installation.
