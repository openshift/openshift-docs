= ValidatingWebhookConfiguration YAML file changes

With {product-title} you can enforce security policies on:

* Object creation
* Object update
* Pod execution
* Pod port forward

== If Central or Sensor is unavailable
The admission controller requires an initial configuration from Sensor to work.
Kubernetes or {ocp} saves this configuration, and it remains accessible even if all admission control service replicas are rescheduled onto other nodes.
If this initial configuration exists, the admission controller enforces all configured deploy-time policies.

If Sensor or Central becomes unavailable later:

* you will not be able to run image scans, or query information about cached image scans.
However, admission controller enforcement still functions based on the available information gathered before the timeout expires, even if the gathered information is incomplete.
* you will not be able to disable the admission controller from the {product-title-short} portal or modify enforcement for an existing policy as the changes will not get propagated to the admission control service.

[NOTE]
====
If you need to disable admission control enforcement, you can delete the validating webhook configuration by running the following command:

* On {ocp}:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete ValidatingWebhookConfiguration/stackrox
----
* On Kubernetes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kubectl delete ValidatingWebhookConfiguration/stackrox
----

== Make the admission controller more reliable

Red{nbsp}Hat recommends that you schedule the admission control service on the control plane and not on worker nodes.
The deployment YAML file includes a soft preference for running on the control plane, however it is not enforced.

By default, the admission control service runs 3 replicas.
To increase reliability, you can increase the replicas by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n stackrox scale deploy/admission-control --replicas=<number_of_replicas> <1>
----
<1> If you use Kubernetes, enter `kubectl` instead of `oc`.

== Using with the roxctl CLI

You can use the following options when you generate a Sensor deployment YAML file:

* `--admission-controller-listen-on-updates`: If you use this option, {product-title} generates a Sensor bundle with a `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` pre-configured to receive update events from the Kubernetes or {ocp} API server.
* `--admission-controller-enforce-on-updates`: If you use this option, {product-title} configures Central such that the admission controller also enforces security policies object updates.

Both these options are optional, and are `false` by default.
