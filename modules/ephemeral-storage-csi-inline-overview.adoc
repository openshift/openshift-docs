= Overview of CSI inline ephemeral volumes

Traditionally, volumes that are backed by Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers can only be used with a `PersistentVolume` and `PersistentVolumeClaim` object combination.

This feature allows you to specify CSI volumes directly in the `Pod` specification, rather than in a PersistentVolume. Inline volumes are ephemeral and do not persist across pod restarts.

== Support limitations

By default, {product-title} supports CSI inline ephemeral volumes with these limitations:

* Support is only available for CSI drivers. In-tree and FlexVolumes are not supported.
* {product-title} does not include any CSI drivers. Use the CSI drivers provided by
link:https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/drivers.html[community or storage vendors]. Follow the installation instructions provided by the CSI driver.
* CSI drivers might not have implemented the inline volume functionality, including `Ephemeral` capacity. For details, see the CSI driver documentation.
