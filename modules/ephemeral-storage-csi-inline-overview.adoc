= Overview of CSI inline ephemeral volumes

Traditionally, volumes that are backed by Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers can only be used with a `PersistentVolume` and `PersistentVolumeClaim` object combination.

This feature allows you to specify CSI volumes directly in the `Pod` specification, rather than in a `PersistentVolume` object. Inline volumes are ephemeral and do not persist across pod restarts.

== Support limitations

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Shared Resource CSI Driver feature is now generally available in link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/builds_for_red_hat_openshift/1.1[{builds-v2title} 1.1]. This feature is now deprecated in {product-title}. To use this feature, ensure you are using {builds-v2title} 1.1 or a more recent version.
====

By default, {product-title} supports CSI inline ephemeral volumes with these limitations:

* Support is only available for CSI drivers. In-tree and FlexVolumes are not supported.
* The Shared Resource CSI Driver supports using inline ephemeral volumes only to access `Secrets` or `ConfigMaps` across multiple namespaces as a Technology Preview feature in {product-title}.
* Community or storage vendors provide other CSI drivers that support these volumes. Follow the installation instructions provided by the CSI driver provider.

CSI drivers might not have implemented the inline volume functionality, including `Ephemeral` capacity. For details, see the CSI driver documentation.
