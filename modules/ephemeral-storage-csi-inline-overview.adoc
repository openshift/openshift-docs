= Overview of CSI inline ephemeral volumes

Traditionally, volumes that are backed by Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers can only be used with a `PersistentVolume` and `PersistentVolumeClaim` object combination.

This feature allows you to specify CSI volumes directly in the `Pod` specification, rather than in a `PersistentVolume` object. Inline volumes are ephemeral and do not persist across pod restarts.

== Support limitations

By default, {product-title} supports CSI inline ephemeral volumes with these limitations:

* Support is only available for CSI drivers. In-tree and FlexVolumes are not supported.
* {product-title} does not include any CSI drivers. Use the CSI drivers provided by link:https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/drivers.html[community or storage vendors]. Follow the installation instructions provided by the CSI driver.
* CSI drivers might not have implemented the inline volume functionality, including `Ephemeral` capacity. For details, see the CSI driver documentation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Support is only available for CSI drivers. In-tree and FlexVolumes are not supported.
* The Shared Resource CSI Driver supports inline ephemeral volumes as a tech preview only feature.
* Other CSI drivers which support these volumes are provided by community or storage vendors. Follow the installation instructions provided by the CSI driver.

CSI drivers might not have implemented the inline volume functionality, including Ephemeral capacity. For details, see the CSI driver documentation.
