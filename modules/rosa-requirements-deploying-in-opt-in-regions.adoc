= Requirements for deploying a cluster in an opt-in region

An AWS opt-in region is a region that is not enabled by default. If you want to deploy a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster that uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS) in an opt-in region, you must meet the following requirements:

* The region must be enabled in your AWS account. For more information about enabling opt-in regions, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html[Managing AWS Regions] in the AWS documentation.
* The security token version in your AWS account must be set to version 2. You cannot use version 1 security tokens for opt-in regions.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Updating to security token version 2 can impact the systems that store the tokens, due to the increased token length. For more information, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/set-security-token-service-preferences.html[the AWS documentation on setting STS preferences].
