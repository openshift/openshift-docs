= About RunStrategies for virtual machines

A `RunStrategy` for virtual machines determines a virtual machine instance's (VMI) behavior, depending on a series of conditions. The `spec.runStrategy` setting exists in the virtual machine configuration process as an alternative to the `spec.running` setting.
The `spec.runStrategy` setting allows greater flexibility for how VMIs are created and managed, in contrast to the `spec.running` setting with only `true` or `false` responses. However, the two settings are mutually exclusive. Only either `spec.running` or `spec.runStrategy` can be used. An error occurs if both are used.

There are four defined RunStrategies.

`Always`::
A VMI is always present when a virtual machine is created. A new VMI is created if the original stops for any reason, which is the same behavior as `spec.running: true`.
`RerunOnFailure`::
A VMI is re-created if the previous instance fails due to an error. The instance is not re-created if the virtual machine stops successfully, such as when it shuts down.
`Manual`::
The `start`, `stop`, and `restart` virtctl client commands can be used to control the VMI's state and existence.
`Halted`::
No VMI is present when a virtual machine is created, which is the same behavior as `spec.running: false`.

Different combinations of the `start`, `stop` and `restart` virtctl commands affect which `RunStrategy` is used.

The following table follows a VM's transition from different states. The first column shows the VM's initial `RunStrategy`. Each additional column shows a virtctl command and the new `RunStrategy` after that command is run.

[NOTE]
====
In {VirtProductName} clusters installed using installer-provisioned infrastructure, when a node fails the MachineHealthCheck and becomes unavailable to the cluster, VMs with a RunStrategy of `Always` or `RerunOnFailure` are rescheduled on a new node.
