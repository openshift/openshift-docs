= Creating a NAD for localnet topology using the web console

You can create a network attachment definition (NAD) to connect workloads to a physical network by using the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites
* You have access to the cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Use `nmstate` to configure the localnet to OVS bridge mappings.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Networking* -> *NetworkAttachmentDefinitions* in the web console.

. Click *Create Network Attachment Definition*. The network attachment definition must be in the same namespace as the pod or virtual machine using it.

. Enter a unique *Name* and optional *Description*.

. Select *OVN Kubernetes secondary localnet network* from the *Network Type* list.

. Enter the name of your pre-configured localnet identifier in the *Bridge mapping* field.

. Optional: You can explicitly set MTU to the specified value. The default value is chosen by the kernel.

. Optional: Encapsulate the traffic in a VLAN. The default value is none.

. Click *Create*.
