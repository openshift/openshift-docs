= About {product-title}

[role="_abstract"]
You can use {prodname} to connect, secure, observe, and protect all of your service endpoints. Use {prodname} in multicloud and hybrid cloud environments. {product-title} is a single data plane used to apply policies to Gateway API resources in {ocp} clusters.

First, configure and deploy ingress gateways with the role-oriented resources and components of the link:https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/[Kubernetes Gateway API]. Then, use {prodname} to attach policies to Gateway API resources. Attaching policies means that you can skip the embedding of networking code into your applications, and use a code-as-infrastructure approach instead.

Example policy types:

* Configure gateways with TLS policies for:

** Certificate management
** Authentication
** Authorization
** Rate limiting

* Integrate DNS policies for:

** Multicluster load balancing
** Health checks
** Remediation

In addition, you can use the following included templates:

* Observability dashboards
* Observability metrics
* Tracing
* Alerts

{prodname} supports link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_mesh/latest/html-single/about/index[{service-mesh} {service-mesh-version}] as the Gateway API provider.
