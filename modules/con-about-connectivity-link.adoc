{prodname} provides a control plane for configuring and deploying ingress Gateways based on the link:https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/[Kubernetes Gateway API] standard. This control plane provides Kubernetes-native APIs for platform engineers to configure Gateways with TLS policies for certificate management, authentication and authorization policies, rate limiting policies, along with DNS policies for multicluster load balancing, health checks, and remediation.

{prodname} also provides data plane policies for application developers to secure and protect applications and APIs with authentication, authorization, and rate limiting. In addition, {prodname} provides templates for observability dashboards, metrics, tracing, and alerts for all user roles.

{prodname} supports link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_mesh/latest/html-single/about/index[{service-mesh} {service-mesh-version}] as the Gateway API provider, which is based on the link:https://istio.io/[Istio] community project.
