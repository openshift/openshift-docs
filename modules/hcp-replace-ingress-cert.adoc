= Replacing the ingress certificate for a hosted cluster

You can replace the default ingress certificate for allapplications under the `.apps` subdomain. After you replace the certificate, all applications, including the web console and CLI, have encryption provided by specified certificate.

.Prerequisites

* You must have a wildcard certificate for the fully qualified `.apps` subdomain and its corresponding private key. Each must be in a separate PEM format file.
* The private key must be unencrypted. If your key is encrypted, decrypt it before importing it into {product-title}.
* The certificate must include the `subjectAltName` extension showing `*.apps.<clustername>.<domain>`.
* The certificate file can contain one or more certificates in a chain. The wildcard certificate must be the first certificate in the file. It can then be followed with any intermediate certificates, and the file must end with the root CA certificate.
* Copy the root CA certificate into an additional PEM format file.
* Verify that all certificates which include `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` also end with one carriage return after that line.

.Procedure

. Create a config map that includes only the root CA certificate that is used to sign the wildcard certificate:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create configmap custom-ca \
     --from-file=ca-bundle.crt=</path/to/example-ca.crt> \//<1>
     -n openshift-config
----
<1> `</path/to/example-ca.crt>` is the path to the root CA certificate file on your local file system.

. Update the cluster-wide proxy configuration with the new config map:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch proxy/cluster \
     --type=merge \
     --patch='{"spec":{"trustedCA":{"name":"custom-ca"}}}'
----

. Create a secret that contains the wildcard certificate chain and key:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create secret tls <secret> \//<1>
     --cert=</path/to/cert.crt> \//<2>
     --key=</path/to/cert.key> \//<3>
     -n openshift-ingress
----
<1> `<secret>` is the name of the secret that will contain the certificate chain and private key.
<2> `</path/to/cert.crt>` is the path to the certificate chain on your local file system.
<3> `</path/to/cert.key>` is the path to the private key associated with this certificate.

. Update the Ingress Controller configuration with the new secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch ingresscontroller.operator default \
     --type=merge -p \
     '{"spec":{"defaultCertificate": {"name": "<secret>"}}}' \//<1>
     -n openshift-ingress-operator
----
<1> Replace `<secret>` with the name used for the secret in the previous step.
