= Setting a node to maintenance mode in the web console

Set a node to maintenance mode using the Options menu {kebab} found on each node in the 
*Compute* -> *Nodes* list, or using the *Actions* control of the *Node Details* 
screen.

.Procedure

. In the {VirtProductName} console, click *Compute* -> *Nodes*.
. You can set the node to maintenance from this screen, which makes it easier to perform 
actions on multiple nodes in the one screen or from the *Node Details* screen
where you can view comprehensive details of the selected node:
** Click the Options menu {kebab} at the end of the node and select *Start Maintenance*.
** Click the node name to open the *Node Details* screen and click 
*Actions* -> *Start Maintenance*.
. Click *Start Maintenance* in the confirmation window. 

The node will live migrate virtual machine instances that have the 
`liveMigration` eviction strategy, and the node is no longer schedulable. All 
other pods and virtual machines on the node are deleted and recreated on another node.
