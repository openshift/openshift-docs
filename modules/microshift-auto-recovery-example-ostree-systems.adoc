[id="microshift-auto-recovery-ostree-systems_{context}"]
= Using automatic recovery with {op-system-ostree}

As a use case, consider the following example situation in which you want to automate the `auto-recovery` process for {op-system-ostree-first} systems that use systemd in the blueprint file.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must include the entire `auto-recovery` process for {op-system-ostree} systems that use `systemd` in the blueprint file.
====

.Prerequisites

* You installed Podman.
* You installed the command-line `composer-cli` tool.

.Procedure

. Optional: Because the `composer-cli` can only create files in the `/etc` directory, package your files into an RPM that you include the blueprint.

. Use the following example to create your blueprint file:
