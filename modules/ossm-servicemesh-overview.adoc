= {ProductName} overview

{ProductName} is a platform that provides behavioral insight and operational control over the service mesh, providing a uniform way to connect, secure, and monitor microservice applications.

The term _service mesh_ describes the network of microservices that make up applications in a distributed microservice architecture and the interactions between those microservices. As a service mesh grows in size and complexity, it can become harder to understand and manage.

Based on the open source link:https://istio.io/[Istio] project, {ProductName} adds a transparent layer on existing distributed applications without requiring any changes to the service code. You add {ProductName} support to services by deploying a special sidecar proxy throughout your environment that intercepts all network communication between microservices. You configure and manage the service mesh using the control plane features.

{ProductName} provides an easy way to create a network of deployed services that provides discovery, load balancing, service-to-service authentication, failure recovery, metrics, and monitoring. A service mesh also provides more complex operational functionality, including A/B testing, canary releases, rate limiting, access control, and end-to-end authentication.
