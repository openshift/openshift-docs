= Manually configuring Quay Container Registry

You can integrate {rh-rhacscs-first} with Quay Container Registry. You can integrate with Quay by using the following methods:

- Integrating with the Quay public repository (registry): This method does not require authentication.
- Integrating with a Quay private registry by using a robot account: This method requires that you create a robot account to use with Quay (recommended). See the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/use_red_hat_quay/use-quay-manage-repo#allow-robot-access-user-repo[Quay documentation] for more information.
- Integrating with Quay to use the Quay scanner rather than the {product-title-short} scanner:  This method uses the API and requires an OAuth token for authentication. See "Integrating with Quay Container Registry to scan images" in the "Additional Resources" section.

.Prerequisites
* For authentication with a Quay private registry, you need the credentials associated with a robot account or an OAuth token (deprecated).

.Procedure
. On the {product-title-short} portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Integrations*.
. Under the *Image Integrations* section, select *Red Hat Quay.io*.
. Click *New integration*.
. Enter the *Integration name.*
. Enter the *Endpoint*, or the address of the registry.
.. If you are integrating with the Quay public repository, under *Type*, select *Registry*, and then go to the next step.
.. If you are integrating with a Quay private registry, under *Type*, select *Registry* and enter information in the following fields:
** *Robot username*: If you are accessing the registry by using a Quay robot account, enter the user name in the format `_<namespace>+<accountname>_`.
** *Robot password*: If you are accessing the registry by using a Quay robot account, enter the password for the robot account user name.
** *OAuth token*: If you are accessing the registry by using an OAuth token (deprecated), enter it in this field.
. Optional: If you are not using a TLS certificate when connecting to the registry, select *Disable TLS certificate validation (insecure)*.
. Optional: To create the integration without testing, select *Create integration without testing*.
. Select *Save*.

[NOTE]
====
If you are editing a Quay integration but do not want to update your credentials, verify that *Update stored credentials* is not selected.
