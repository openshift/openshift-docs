The following bug is fixed with this release:

* Before this update, the Machine API Controller (MAPI) in a {hcp} management cluster had a memory leak, and caused extreme memory use on the primary node. As a consequence, the cluster performance was affected. With this release, the memory leak in the MAPI controller is fixed, excessive memory use on primary nodes is reduced, and the cluster stability is improved.
