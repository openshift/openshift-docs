[id="installation-osp-deploying-provider-networks-installer_{context}"]
= Deploying a cluster that has a primary interface on a provider network

You can deploy an {product-title} cluster that has its primary network interface on an {rh-openstack-first} provider network.

.Prerequisites

* Your {rh-openstack-first} deployment is configured as described by "{rh-openstack} provider network requirements for cluster installation".

.Procedure

. In a text editor, open the `install-config.yaml` file.
. Set the value of the `platform.openstack.apiVIPs` property to the IP address for the API VIP.
. Set the value of the `platform.openstack.ingressVIPs` property to the IP address for the Ingress VIP.
. Set the value of the `platform.openstack.machinesSubnet` property to the UUID of the provider network subnet.
. Set the value of the `networking.machineNetwork.cidr` property to the CIDR block of the provider network subnet.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `platform.openstack.apiVIPs` and `platform.openstack.ingressVIPs` properties must both be unassigned IP addresses from the `networking.machineNetwork.cidr` block.

<1> In {product-title} 4.12 and later, the `apiVIP` and `ingressVIP` configuration settings are deprecated. Instead, use a list format to enter values in the `apiVIPs` and `ingressVIPs` configuration settings.

[WARNING]
====
You cannot set the `platform.openstack.externalNetwork` or `platform.openstack.externalDNS` parameters while using a provider network for the primary network interface.
====

When you deploy the cluster, the installer uses the `install-config.yaml` file to deploy the cluster on the provider network.
