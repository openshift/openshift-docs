== Resolved issues

{mtc-first} 1.8.7 has the following major resolved issues:

.{mtc-short} migration stuck in a `Prepare` phase on {product-title} 4.19 due to incompatible {oadp-short} version and outdated DPA specification

When running migrations use {mtc-short} 1.8.7 on {product-title} 4.19, the process halts in the `Prepare` phase and the migration plan enters in the `Suspended` phase.

The root cause is the deployment of an incompatible {oadp-short} version, earlier than 1.5.0, whose DataProtectionApplication (DPA) specification format is incompatible with {product-title}. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MIG-1735[(MIG-1735)]

.Velero backup fails with a `file already closed` error when using the new {aws-short} plugin in {mtc-short}

During stage or full migrations, the backup process intermittently fails for {mtc-short} with {oadp-short} on {product-title} clusters configured with the new {aws-first} plugin. You can see the following error in Velero logs:

[source,terminal]
----
error="read |0: file already closed"
----

As a workaround, use the legacy {aws-short} plugin by performing following actions:

. Set `velero_use_legacy_aws: true` in the `MigrationController` custom resource (CR).

. Restart the {mtc-short} Operator to apply changes.

. Validate the {aws-short} credentials for the cloud-credentials secret.
