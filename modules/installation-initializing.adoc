= Creating the installation configuration file

You can customize your installation of {product-title} on a compatible cloud.

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the {product-title} installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.

.Procedure

. Create the `install-config.yaml` file.
.. Run the following command:
+
----
$ ./openshift-install create install-config --dir=<installation_directory> <1>
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the directory name to store the
files that the installation program creates.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Specify an empty directory. Some installation assets, like bootstrap X.509
certificates have short expiration intervals, so you must not reuse an
installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another
cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file
names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution
when copying installation files from an earlier {product-title} version.
====
.. At the prompts, provide the configuration details for your cloud:
... Optional: Select an SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.
+
[NOTE]
====
For production {product-title} clusters on which you want to perform installation
debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide an SSH key that your `ssh-agent`
process uses to the installation program.
====
ifdef::aws[]
... Select *AWS* as the platform to target.
... If you do not have an Amazon Web Services (AWS) profile stored on your computer, enter the AWS
access key ID and secret access key for the user that you configured to run the
installation program.
... Select the AWS region to deploy the cluster to.
... Select the base domain for the Route53 service that you configured for your cluster.
endif::aws[]
... Enter a descriptive name for your cluster.
... Paste the pull secret that you obtained from the
link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install[OpenShift Infrastructure Providers] page.

. Modify the `install-config.yaml` file. You can find more information about
the available parameters in the *Installation configuration parameters* section
and in the
link:https://godoc.org/github.com/openshift/installer/pkg/types#InstallConfig[Go documentation].

. Back up the `install-config.yaml` file so that you can use
it to install multiple clusters.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `install-config.yaml` file is consumed during the installation process. If
you want to reuse the file, you must back it up now.
