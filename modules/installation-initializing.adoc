= Creating the installation configuration file

You can customize your installation of {product-title} on a compatible cloud.

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the {product-title} installation program and the access token for your cluster.
* Obtain configuration details for your cloud.

.Procedure

. Create the `install-config.yaml` file.
.. Run the following command:
+
----
$ ./openshift-install create install-config --dir=<installation_directory> <1>
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the directory name to store the
files that the installation program creates.  Do not use a directory which
was used for previous installations unless you want to recycle assets from
those earlier clusters.  Because some assets like bootstrap X.509 certificates
have limited expiration times, it is usually better to start with a fresh
installation directory for each new cluster.
.. At the prompts, provide the configuration details for your cloud:
... Optionally, select an SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.
+
[NOTE]
====
For production {product-title} clusters on which you want to perform installation
debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide an SSH key that your `ssh-agent`
process uses to the installer.
====
... Select AWS as the platform to target.
... Select the AWS region to deploy the cluster to.
... Select the base domain for the Route53 service that you configured for your cluster.
... Enter a descriptive name for your cluster.
... Paste the pull secret that you obtained from
link:https://cloud.openshift.com/clusters/install[the OpenShift start page].

. Modify the `install-config.yaml` file. You can find more information about
the available parameters in the *Installation configuration parameters* section
and in the
link:https://godoc.org/github.com/openshift/installer/pkg/types#InstallConfig[Go documentation].

. Back up the `install-config.yaml` file so that you can use
it to install multiple clusters.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `install-config.yaml` file is consumed during the installation process. If
you want to reuse the file, you must back it up now.
