= Running compliance scans

You can run a scan using the Center for Internet Security (CIS) profiles. For convenience, the Compliance Operator creates a `ScanSetting` object with reasonable defaults on startup. This `ScanSetting` object is named `default`.

.Procedure

.  Inspect the `ScanSetting` object by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe scansettings default -n openshift-compliance
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ScanSetting
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: openshift-compliance
rawResultStorage:
  pvAccessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce <1>
  rotation: 3 <2>
  size: 1Gi <3>
roles:
- worker <4>
- master <4>
scanTolerations: <5>
- effect: NoSchedule
  key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
  operator: Exists
schedule: 0 1 * * * <6>

<1> The Compliance Operator creates a persistent volume (PV) that contains the results of the scans. By default, the PV will use access mode `ReadWriteOnce` because the Compliance Operator cannot make any assumptions about the storage classes configured on the cluster. Additionally, `ReadWriteOnce` access mode is available on most clusters. If you need to fetch the scan results, you can do so by using a helper pod, which also binds the volume. Volumes that use the `ReadWriteOnce` access mode can be mounted by only one pod at time, so it is important to remember to delete the helper pods. Otherwise, the Compliance Operator will not be able to reuse the volume for subsequent scans.
<2> The Compliance Operator keeps results of three subsequent scans in the volume; older scans are rotated.
<3> The Compliance Operator will allocate one GB of storage for the scan results.
<4> If the scan setting uses any profiles that scan cluster nodes, scan these node roles.
<5> The default scan setting object also scans the control plane nodes.
<6> The default scan setting object runs scans at 01:00 each day.
+
As an alternative to the default scan setting, you can use `default-auto-apply`, which has the following settings:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ScanSetting
metadata:
  name: default-auto-apply
  namespace: openshift-compliance
autoUpdateRemediations: true <1>
autoApplyRemediations: true <1>
rawResultStorage:
  pvAccessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  rotation: 3
  size: 1Gi
schedule: 0 1 * * *
roles:
  - worker
  - master
scanTolerations:
  - effect: NoSchedule
    key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
    operator: Exists
----
<1> Setting `autoUpdateRemediations` and `autoApplyRemediations` flags to `true` allows you to easily create `ScanSetting` objects that auto-remediate without extra steps.

. Create a `ScanSettingBinding` object that binds to the default `ScanSetting` object and scans the cluster using the `cis` and `cis-node` profiles. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ScanSettingBinding
metadata:
  name: cis-compliance
profiles:
  - name: ocp4-cis-node
    kind: Profile
    apiGroup: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
  - name: ocp4-cis
    kind: Profile
    apiGroup: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
settingsRef:
  name: default
  kind: ScanSetting
  apiGroup: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
----

. Create the `ScanSettingBinding` object by running:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <file-name>.yaml -n openshift-compliance
----
+
At this point in the process, the `ScanSettingBinding` object is reconciled and based on the `Binding` and the `Bound` settings. The Compliance Operator creates a `ComplianceSuite` object and the associated `ComplianceScan` objects.

. Follow the compliance scan progress by running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get compliancescan -w -n openshift-compliance
----
+
The scans progress through the scanning phases and eventually reach the `DONE` phase when complete. In most cases, the result of the scan is `NON-COMPLIANT`. You can review the scan results and start applying remediations to make the cluster compliant.
