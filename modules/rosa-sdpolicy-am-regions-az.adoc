Multiple availability zone clusters can only be deployed in regions with at least 3 availability zones. For more information, see the link:https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/[Regions and Availability Zones] section in the AWS documentation.

Each new {product-title} cluster is installed within an installer-created or preexisting Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in a single region, with the option to deploy into a single availability zone (Single-AZ) or across multiple availability zones (Multi-AZ). This provides cluster-level network and resource isolation, and enables cloud-provider VPC settings, such as VPN connections and VPC Peering. Persistent volumes (PVs) are backed by AWS Elastic Block Storage (EBS), and are specific to the availability zone in which they are provisioned. Persistent volume claims (PVCs) do not bind to a volume until the associated pod resource is assigned into a specific availability zone to prevent unschedulable pods. Availability zone-specific resources are only usable by resources in the same availability zone.

[WARNING]
====
The region and the choice of single or multiple availability zone cannot be changed after a cluster has been deployed.
