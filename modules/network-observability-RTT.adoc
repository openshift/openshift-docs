= Working with RTT tracing
You can track RTT by editing the `FlowCollector` to the specifications in the following YAML example.

.Procedure
. In the web console, navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
. In the *Provided APIs* heading for the *NetObserv Operator*, select *Flow Collector*.
. Select *cluster*, and then select the *YAML* tab.
. Configure the `FlowCollector` custom resource for RTT tracing, for example:

----
<1> You can start tracing RTT network flows by listing the `FlowRTT` parameter in the `spec.agent.ebpf.features` specification list.
 
.Verification
When you refresh the *Network Traffic* page, the *Overview*, *Traffic Flow*, and *Topology* views display new information about RTT:

.. In the *Overview*, select new choices in *Manage panels* to choose which graphical visualizations of RTT to display.
.. In the *Traffic flows* table, the *Flow RTT* column can be seen, and you can manage display in *Manage columns*.
.. In the *Traffic Flows* view, you can also expand the side panel to view more information about RTT.
+
.Example filtering
... Click the *Common* filters -> *Protocol*. 
... Filter the network flow data based on *TCP*, *Ingress* direction, and look for *FlowRTT* values greater than 10,000,000 nanoseconds (10ms).
... Remove the *Protocol* filter. 
... Filter for *Flow RTT* values greater than 0 in the *Common* filters.

.. In the *Topology* view, click the Display option dropdown. Then click *RTT* in the *edge labels* drop-down list.
