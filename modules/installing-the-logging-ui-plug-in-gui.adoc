= Installing the logging UI plugin by using the web console

Install the logging UI plugin by using the web console so that you can visualize logs.
 
.Prerequisites
* You have administrator permissions.
* You have access to the {ocp-product-title} web console.
* You installed and configured {loki-op}.

.Procedure
. Install the {coo-full}. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/latest/html/cluster_observability_operator/installing-cluster-observability-operators[Installing the Cluster Observability Operator].

. Navigate to the *Installed Operators* page. Under *Provided APIs*, select *ClusterObservabilityOperator*. Find the `UIPlugin` resource and click *Create Instance*.

. Select the YAML view, and then use the following template to create a `UIPlugin` custom resource (CR):

.Example `UIPlugin` CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: observability.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: UIPlugin
metadata:
  name: logging  # <1>
spec:
  type: Logging  # <2>
  logging:
    lokiStack:
      name: logging-loki  # <3>
    logsLimit: 50
    timeout: 30s
    schema: otel # <4>
----
<1> Set `name` to `logging`.
<2> Set `type` to `Logging`.
<3> The `name` value must match the name of your LokiStack instance. If you did not install LokiStack in the `openshift-logging` namespace, set the LokiStack namespace under the `lokiStack` configuration.
<4> `schema` is one of `otel`, `viaq`, or `select`. The default is `viaq` if no value is specified. When you choose `select`, you can select the mode in the UI when you run a query.

[NOTE]
====
These are the known issues for the logging UI plugin - for more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OU-587[OU-587].

* The `schema` feature is only supported in {ocp-product-title} 4.15 and later. In earlier versions of {ocp-product-title}, the logging UI plugin will only use the `viaq` attribute, ignoring any other values that might be set.
* Non-administrator users cannot query logs using the `otel` attribute with {logging} {for} versions 5.8 to 6.2. This issue will be fixed in a future {logging} release. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6589[LOG-6589])
* In {logging} {for} version 5.9, the `severity_text` Otel attribute is not set.
====

. Click *Create*.

.Verification
. Refresh the page when a pop-up message instructs you to do so. 
. Navigate to the *Observe â†’ Logs* panel, where you can run LogQL queries. You can also query logs for individual pods from the *Aggregated Logs* tab of a specific pod.
