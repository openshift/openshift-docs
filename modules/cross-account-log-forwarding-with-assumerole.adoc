= Cross-account log forwarding with AssumeRole

You can forward logs to external {aws-short} accounts by using the {aws-short} {sts-first}  `AssumeRole` functionality.
Cross-account log forwarding enables centralized logging across multiple {aws-short} accounts while maintaining security boundaries.

Cross-account log forwarding works as follows:

. Initial Authentication:
The collector authenticates to the {aws-short} account of your cluster using Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles or access keys.
. Role Assumption:
After initial authentication, the collector assumes a role in the target {aws-short} account.
. Log Forwarding:
The collector forwards logs to CloudWatch in the target account 
using credentials of the assumed role. 

Keep these security considerations in mind when using cross-account log forwarding:

* Use external IDs for cross-account role assumptions.
+
External ID serves as an additional identifier.
Note that external IDs are not secrets because they appear in CloudTrail logs and API responses.
Take the following measures when creating external IDs:

** They should be unique for each trust relationship.
** They should be unpredictable and not based on public information.

* Grant only the minimum required permissions to assumed roles.

* Protect secrets containing role Amazon Resource Names (ARN) and tokens.

* Monitor CloudTrail for `AssumeRole` activity.
