= Cross-account log forwarding with AssumeRole

You can forward logs to external {aws-short} accounts by using the {aws-short} {sts-first}  `AssumeRole` functionality.
Cross-account log forwarding enables centralized logging across multiple {aws-short} accounts while maintaining security boundaries.

Cross-account log forwarding works as follows:

. Initial Authentication:
The collector authenticates to the {aws-short} account of your cluster using Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles or access keys.
. Role Assumption:
After initial authentication, the collector assumes a role in the target {aws-short} account.
. Log Forwarding:
The collector forwards logs to CloudWatch or S3 bucket in the target account using credentials of the assumed role. 

When using cross-account log forwarding, keep these security considerations in mind :

* Use external IDs for cross-account role assumptions.
+
External ID serves as an additional identifier.

[NOTE]
====
External IDs appear in CloudTrail logs and API responses. Therefore, they are not considered secrets. 
====
+
Take the following measures when creating external IDs:

** They should be unique for each trust relationship.
** They should be unpredictable and not based on public information.

* Grant only the minimum required permissions to assumed roles.

* Protect secrets containing role Amazon Resource Names (ARN) and tokens.

* Monitor CloudTrail for `AssumeRole` activity.
