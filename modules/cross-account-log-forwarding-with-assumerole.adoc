= Cross-account log forwarding with AssumeRole

You can forward logs to external AWS accounts using the AWS STS AssumeRole functionality. Cross-account log forwarding enables centralized logging across multiple AWS accounts while maintaining security boundaries.
 
Cross-account log forwarding works as follows:

. Initial Authentication: The collector authenticates to your cluster's AWS account using IAM roles or access keys.
. Role Assumption: After initial authentication, the collector assumes a role in the target AWS account.
. Log Forwarding: Using the assumed role's credentials, the collector forwards logs to CloudWatch in the target account
