= Ingress Node Firewall Operator

The Ingress Node Firewall Operator provides ingress firewall rules at a node level by deploying the daemon set to nodes you specify and manage in the firewall configurations. To deploy the daemon set, you create an `IngressNodeFirewallConfig` custom resource (CR). The Operator applies the `IngressNodeFirewallConfig` CR to create ingress node firewall daemon set `daemon`, which run on all nodes that match the `nodeSelector`.

You configure `rules` of the `IngressNodeFirewall` CR and apply them to clusters using the `nodeSelector` and setting values to "true".

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Ingress Node Firewall Operator supports only stateless firewall rules.

Network interface controllers (NICs) that do not support native XDP drivers will run at a lower performance.

For {product-title} 4.14 or later, you must run Ingress Node Firewall Operator on {op-system-base} 9.0 or later.

Ingress Node Firewall Operator is not supported on {aws-first} with the default OpenShift installation or on {product-rosa} (ROSA). For more information on {product-rosa} support and ingress, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/networking/ingress-operator.html[Ingress Operator in Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS].
