:FeatureName: OpenShift zones support for vSphere host groups
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

When deploying an {product-title} cluster to {vmw-first}, you can map your {vmw-short} host groups onto {product-title} failure domains. This is useful if you are using a stretched cluster configuration, where ESXi hosts are grouped into host groups by physical location.

To enable this feature, you must meet the following requirements:

* You must arrange your ESXi hosts into host groups.
* You must create a vCenter tag in the `openshift-region` tag category for your cluster. After you create the tag, you must attach the tag to the cluster.
* You must create a vCenter tag in the `openshift-zone` tag category for each host group and then attach the correct tag to each ESXi host.
* You must define multiple failure domains for your {product-title} cluster in the `install-config.yaml` file.
* You must grant the `Host.Inventory.EditCluster` privilege on the {vmw-short} vCenter cluster object.
* You must include the following parameters in your `install-config.yaml` file to enable this Technology Preview feature:

Review the following key terms, which correspond to parameters in your `install-config.yaml` file that you must configure to enable this feature:

* Failure domain: Specifies the relationships between regions and zones in {product-title}, and clusters and host groups in {vmw-short}. You define a failure domain by using vCenter objects, such as a `datastore` object. A failure domain defines the vCenter location for {product-title} cluster nodes.
* Region: Specifies a vCenter cluster. You define a region by using a tag from the `openshift-region` tag category.
* Zone: Specifies a vCenter host group. You define a zone by using a tag from the `openshift-zone` tag category.
* Region type: Specifies the `ComputeCluster` region type to enable this feature.
* Zone type: Specifies the `HostGroup` zone type to enable this feature.
