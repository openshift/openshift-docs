= Installing the Network Observability Operator
You can install the Network Observability Operator using the {product-title} web console Operator Hub. When you install the Operator,  it provides the `FlowCollector` custom resource definition (CRD). You can set specifications in the web console when you create the  `FlowCollector`.  

.Prerequisites

* Installed Loki. It is recommended to install Loki using the link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/openshift-logging/loki-rhel8-operator/622b46bcae289285d6fcda39[Loki Operator version 5.6]. 

.Procedure

.. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.
//In the Operator Hub on the test console Julian provided perms for, its NetObserv Operator, with a capital O. 
.. Choose  *Network Observability Operator* from the list of available Operators in the *OperatorHub*, and click *Install*.
.. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*. Under Provided APIs for Network Observability, select the *Flow Collector* link.
. Navigate to the *Flow Collector* tab, and click *Create FlowCollector*. Make the following selections in the form view:
+
* *spec.agent.ebpf.Sampling* : Specify a sampling size for flows. Lower sampling sizes will have higher impact on resource utilization. For more information, see the `FlowCollector` API reference, under spec.agent.ebpf. 
* *spec.deploymentModel*: If you are using Kafka, verify Kafka is selected.
* *loki.url*: Since authentication is specified separately, this URL needs to be updated to `https://loki-gateway-http.netobserv.svc:8080/api/logs/v1/network`. The first part of the URL, "loki", should match the name of your LokiStack.
* *loki.tenantID*: Set this to `network`.
* *loki.statusUrl*: Set this to `https://loki-query-frontend-http.netobserv.svc:3100/`.
* *loki.authToken*: Select the `HOST` value.
* *tls.enable*: Verify that the box is checked so it is enabled.
. Click *Create*. 

.Verification

To confirm this was successful, when you navigate to *Observe* you should see *Network Traffic* listed in the options. 

In the absence of *Application Traffic* within the {product-title} cluster, default filters might show that there are "No results", which results in no visual flow. Beside the filter selections, select *Clear all filters* to see the flow. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you installed Loki using the Loki Operator, it is advised not to use `querierUrl`, as it can break the console access to Loki. If you installed Loki using another type of Loki installation, this does not apply.
