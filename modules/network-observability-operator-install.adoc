= Installing the Network Observability Operator
You can install the Network Observability Operator using the {product-title} web console Operator Hub. When you install the Operator,  it provides the `FlowCollector` custom resource definition (CRD). You can set specifications in the web console when you create the  `FlowCollector`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The actual memory consumption of the Operator depends on your cluster size and the number of resources deployed. Memory consumption might need to be adjusted accordingly. For more information refer to "Network Observability controller manager pod runs out of memory" in the "Important Flow Collector configuration considerations" section. 
====

.Prerequisites

* If you choose to use Loki, install the link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/openshift-logging/loki-rhel8-operator/622b46bcae289285d6fcda39[Loki Operator version 5.7+].
* You must have `cluster-admin` privileges.
* One of the following supported architectures is required: `amd64`, `ppc64le`, `arm64`, or `s390x`.
* Any CPU supported by Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9

[NOTE]
====
This documentation assumes that your `LokiStack` instance name is `loki`. Using a different name requires additional configuration.
====

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.
. Choose  *Network Observability Operator* from the list of available Operators in the *OperatorHub*, and click *Install*.
. Select the checkbox `Enable Operator recommended cluster monitoring on this Namespace`.
. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*. Under Provided APIs for Network Observability, select the *Flow Collector* link.
. Navigate to the *Flow Collector* tab, and click *Create FlowCollector*. Make the following selections in the form view:
.. *spec.agent.ebpf.Sampling*: Specify a sampling size for flows. Lower sampling sizes will have higher impact on resource utilization. For more information, see the "FlowCollector API reference", `spec.agent.ebpf`.
.. If you are using Loki, set the following specifications:
... *spec.loki.enable*: Select the check box to enable storing flows in Loki.
... *spec.loki.url*: Since authentication is specified separately, this URL needs to be updated to `https://loki-gateway-http.netobserv.svc:8080/api/logs/v1/network`. The first part of the URL, "loki", must match the name of your `LokiStack`.
... *spec.loki.authToken*: Select the `FORWARD` value.
... *spec.loki.statusUrl*: Set this to `https://loki-query-frontend-http.netobserv.svc:3100/`. The first part of the URL, "loki", must match the name of your `LokiStack`.
... *spec.loki.tls.enable*: Select the checkbox to enable TLS.
... *spec.loki.statusTls*: The `enable` value is false by default.
+
For the first part of the certificate reference names: `loki-gateway-ca-bundle`, `loki-ca-bundle`, and `loki-query-frontend-http`,`loki`, must match the name of your `LokiStack`.
.. Optional: If you are in a large-scale environment, consider configuring the `FlowCollector` with Kafka for forwarding data in a more resilient, scalable way. See "Configuring the Flow Collector resource with Kafka storage" in the "Important Flow Collector configuration considerations" section. 
.. Optional: Configure other optional settings before the next step of creating the `FlowCollector`. For example, if you choose not to use Loki, then you can configure exporting flows to Kafka or IPFIX. See "Export enriched network flow data to Kafka and IPFIX" and more in the "Important Flow Collector configuration considerations" section.
.. Click *Create*.

.Verification

To confirm this was successful, when you navigate to *Observe* you should see *Network Traffic* listed in the options.

In the absence of *Application Traffic* within the {product-title} cluster, default filters might show that there are "No results", which results in no visual flow. Beside the filter selections, select *Clear all filters* to see the flow.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you installed Loki using the Loki Operator, it is advised not to use `querierUrl`, as it can break the console access to Loki. If you installed Loki using another type of Loki installation, this does not apply.
