= Init bundles for secured cluster authentication

[role="_abstract"]
You can establish secure communication between your secured cluster services and {rh-rhacs-first} Central by generating and applying an init bundle. You can create an YAML file containing essential TLS secrets by using the {product-title-short} portal or the `roxctl` CLI, and then apply the resources to your cluster to authorize service connections.

When you apply the init bundle to a secured cluster, it creates the necessary TLS certificate resources, including:

* `collector-tls`
* `sensor-tls`
* `admission-control-tls`

You can generate init bundles using either the {product-title-short} portal or the `roxctl` CLI. The bundle is generated as a YAML file containing the required secrets. Because this file contains sensitive credentials, it must be stored securely.

[NOTE]
====
If you are installing secured cluster services by using Helm charts, the init bundle is often applied as part of the Helm installation command rather than as a separate step.
