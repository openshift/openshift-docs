[id="virt-creating-bridge-nad-cli_{context}"]
= Creating a Linux bridge NetworkAttachmentDefinition in the CLI

As a network administrator, you can configure a NetworkAttachmentDefinition
of type `cnv-bridge` to provide Layer-2 networking to Pods and virtual machines.

[NOTE]
====
The NetworkAttachmentDefinition must be in the same namespace as the Pod or virtual machine.
====

.Procedure

. Create a new file for the NetworkAttachmentDefinition in any local directory.
The file must have the following contents, modified to match your
configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: a-bridge-network
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/resourceName: bridge.network.kubevirt.io/br0 <1>
spec:
  config: '{
    "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
    "name": "a-bridge-network", <2>
    "plugins": [
      {
        "type": "cnv-bridge", <3>
        "bridge": "br0" <4>
      },
      {
        "type": "cnv-tuning" <5>
      }
    ]
  }'
----
<1> If you add this annotation to your NetworkAttachmentDefinition, your virtual machine instances
will only run on nodes that have the `br0` bridge connected.
<2> Required. A name for the configuration. It is recommended to match the configuration name to the `name` value of the NetworkAttachmentDefinition.
<3> The actual name of the Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-in that provides
the network for this NetworkAttachmentDefinition. Do not change this field unless
you want to use a different CNI.
<4> You must substitute the actual name of the bridge, if it is not `br0`.
<5> Required. This allows the MAC pool manager to assign a unique MAC address to the connection.

+
----
$ oc create -f <resource_spec.yaml>
----

. Edit the configuration file of a virtual machine or virtual machine instance that you want to connect to the bridge network, for example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
    name: example-vm
spec:
  domain:
    devices:
      interfaces:
        - masquerade: {}
          name: default
        - bridge: {}
          name: bridge-net <1>
  ...

  networks:
    - name: default
      pod: {}
    - name: bridge-net <1>
      multus:
        networkName: a-bridge-network <2>
...
----
<1> The `name` value for the bridge interface and network must be the same.
<2> You must substitute the actual `name` value from the
NetworkAttachmentDefinition.
+
[NOTE]
====
The virtual machine instance will be connected to both the `default` Pod network and `bridge-net`, which is
defined by a NetworkAttachmentDefinition named `a-bridge-network`.
====

. Apply the configuration file to the resource:
+
----
$ oc create -f <local/path/to/network-attachment-definition.yaml>
