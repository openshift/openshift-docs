= Ignoring Source-to-Image (S2I) source files

Source to image supports a `.s2iignore` file, which contains a list of file patterns that should be ignored. Files in the build working directory, as provided by the various input sources, that match a pattern found in the `.s2iignore` file will not be made available to the `assemble` script.

For more details on the format of the `.s2iignore` file, see the source-to-image documentation.
