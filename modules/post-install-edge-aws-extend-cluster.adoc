= Extend existing clusters to use AWS Local Zones

As a post-installation task, you can extend an existing {product-title} cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to use AWS Local Zones.

Extending nodes to Local Zone locations comprises the following steps:

- Adjusting the cluster-network maximum transmission unit (MTU)
- Opting in the Local Zone group to AWS Local Zones
- Creating a subnet in the existing VPC for a Local Zone location
- Creating the machine set manifest, and then creating a node in each Local Zone location

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you extend an existing {product-title} cluster on AWS to use Local Zones, check that the existing VPC contains available Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks. These blocks are needed for creating the subnets.
