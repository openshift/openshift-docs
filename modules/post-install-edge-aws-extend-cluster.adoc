= Extend existing clusters to use {aws-short} Local Zones or Wavelength Zones

[role="_abstract"]
As a post-installation task, you can extend an existing {product-title} cluster on {aws-full} to use {aws-short} {zone-type}.

Extending nodes to {zone-type} locations comprises the following steps:

- Adjusting the cluster-network maximum transmission unit (MTU).
- Opting in the {zone-type} group to {aws-short} {zone-type}.
- Creating a subnet in the existing VPC for a {zone-type} location.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you extend an existing {product-title} cluster on {aws-short} to use {zone-type}, check that the existing VPC contains available Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks. These blocks are needed for creating the subnets.

- Creating the machine set manifest, and then creating a node in each Local Zone or Wavelength Zone location.
- Local Zones only: Adding the permission  `ec2:ModifyAvailabilityZoneGroup` to the Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role, so that the required network resources can be created. For example:
