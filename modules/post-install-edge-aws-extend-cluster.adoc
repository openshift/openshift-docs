= Extend existing clusters to use {aws-service-name-full}

As a postinstallation task, you can extend an existing {product-title} cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to use {aws-service-name-full}.

Extending nodes to {aws-service-name-single} locations comprises the following steps:

- Adjusting the cluster-network maximum transmission unit (MTU)
- Opting in the {aws-service-name-single} group to {aws-service-name-full}
- Creating a subnet in the existing VPC for a {aws-service-name-single} location
- Creating the machine set manifest, and then creating a node in each {aws-service-name-single} location

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you extend an existing {product-title} cluster on AWS to use {aws-service-name-short},
check that the existing VPC contains available Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks.
These blocks are needed for creating the subnets.
