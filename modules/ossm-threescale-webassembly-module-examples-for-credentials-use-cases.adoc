[id="ossm-threescale-webassembly-module-examples-for-credentials-use-cases_{context}"]
= The 3scale WebAssembly module examples for credentials use cases

You will spend most of your time applying configuration steps to obtain credentials in the requests to your services.

The following are `credentials` examples, which you can modify to adapt to specific use cases.

You can combine them all, although when you specify multiple source objects with their own `lookup queries`, they are evaluated in order until one of them successfully resolves.

[id="api-key-in-query-string-parameters_{context}"]
== API key (user_key) in query string parameters
The following example looks up a `user_key` in a query string parameter or header of the same name:

[source,yaml]
----
credentials:
  user_key:
    - query_string:
        keys:
          - user_key
    - header:
        keys:
          - user_key
----

[id="application-id-and-key_{context}"]
== Application ID and key
The following example looks up `app_key` and `app_id` credentials in a query or headers.

[source,yaml]
----
credentials:
  app_id:
    - header:
        keys:
          - app_id
    - query_string:
        keys:
          - app_id
  app_key:
    - header:
        keys:
          - app_key
    - query_string:
        keys:
          - app_key
----

[id="authorization-header_{context}"]
== Authorization header
A request includes an `app_id` and `app_key` in an `authorization` header. If there is at least one or two values outputted at the end, then you can assign the `app_key`.

The resolution here assigns the `app_key` if there is one or two outputted at the end.

The `authorization` header specifies a value with the type of authorization and its value is encoded as `Base64`. This means you can split the value by a space character, take the second output and then split it again using a colon (:) as the separator. For example, if you use this format `app_id:app_key`, the header looks like the following example for `credential`:

----
aladdin:opensesame:  Authorization: Basic YWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuc2VzYW1l
----

You must use lower case header field names as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
credentials:
  app_id:
    - header:
        keys:
          - authorization
        ops:
          - split:
              separator: " "
              max: 2
          - length:
              min: 2
          - drop:
              head: 1
          - base64_urlsafe
          - split:
              max: 2
  app_key:
    - header:
        keys:
          - app_key
----

The previous example use case looks at the headers for an `authorization`:

. It takes its string value and split it by a space, checking that it generates at least two values of a `credential`-type and the `credential` itself, then dropping the `credential`-type.
. It then decodes the second value containing the data it needs, and splits it by using a colon (:) character to have an operations stack including first the `app_id`, then the `app_key`, if it exists.
.. If `app_key` does not exist in the authorization header then its specific sources are checked, for example, the header with the key `app_key` in this case.
. To add extra conditions to `credentials`, allow `Basic` authorizations, where `app_id` is either `aladdin` or `admin`, or any `app_id` being at least 8 characters in length.
. `app_key` must contain a value and have a minimum of 64 characters as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
credentials:
  app_id:
    - header:
        keys:
          - authorization
        ops:
          - split:
              separator: " "
              max: 2
          - length:
              min: 2
          - reverse
          - glob:
            - Basic
          - drop:
              tail: 1
          - base64_urlsafe
          - split:
              max: 2
          - test:
              if:
                length:
                  min: 2
              then:
                - strlen:
                    max: 63
                - or:
                    - strlen:
                        min: 1
                    - drop:
                        tail: 1
          - assert:
            - and:
              - reverse
              - or:
                - strlen:
                    min: 8
                - glob:
                  - aladdin
                  - admin
----
+
. After picking up the `authorization` header value, you get a `Basic` `credential`-type by reversing the stack so that the type is placed on top.
. Run a glob match on it. When it validates, and the credential is decoded and split, you get the `app_id` at the bottom of the stack, and potentially the `app_key` at the top.
. Run a `test:` if there are two values in the stack, meaning an `app_key` was acquired.
.. Ensure the string length is between 1 and 63, including `app_id` and `app_key`. If the key's length is zero, drop it and continue as if no key exists. If there was only an `app_id` and no `app_key`, the missing else branch indicates a successful test and evaluation continues.

The last operation, `assert`, indicates that no side-effects make it into the stack. You can then modify the stack:

. Reverse the stack to have the `app_id` at the top.
.. Whether or not an `app_key` is present, reversing the stack ensures `app_id` is at the top.
. Use `and` to preserve the contents of the stack across tests.
+
Then use one of the following possibilities:
+
* Make sure `app_id` has a string length of at least 8.
* Make sure `app_id` matches either `aladdin` or `admin`.

[id="openid-connect-use-case_{context}"]
== OpenID Connect (OIDC) use case
For {ProductShortName} and the 3scale Istio adapter, you must deploy a `RequestAuthentication` as shown in the following example, filling in your own workload data and `jwtRules`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
  kind: RequestAuthentication
  metadata:
    name: jwt-example
    namespace: bookinfo
  spec:
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: productpage
    jwtRules:
    - issuer: >-
        http://keycloak-keycloak.34.242.107.254.nip.io/auth/realms/3scale-keycloak
      jwksUri: >-
        http://keycloak-keycloak.34.242.107.254.nip.io/auth/realms/3scale-keycloak/protocol/openid-connect/certs
----

When you apply the `RequestAuthentication`, it configures `Envoy` with a link:https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.19.0/api-v3/extensions/filters/http/jwt_authn/v3/config.proto.html[native plug-in] to validate `JWT` tokens. The proxy validates everything before running the module so any requests that fail do not make it to the 3scale WebAssembly module.

When a `JWT` token is validated, the proxy stores its contents in an internal metadata object, with an entry whose key depends on the specific configuration of the plug-in. This use case gives you the ability to look up structure objects with a single entry containing an unknown key name.

The 3scale `app_id` for OIDC matches the OAuth `client_id`. This is found in the `azp` or `aud` fields of `JWT` tokens.

To get `app_id` field from Envoy's native `JWT` authentication filter, see the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
credentials:
  app_id:
    - filter:
        path:
          - envoy.filters.http.jwt_authn
          - "0"
        keys:
          - azp
          - aud
        ops:
          - take:
              head: 1
----

The example instructs the module to use the `filter` source type to look up filter metadata for an object from the `Envoy`-specific `JWT` authentication native plug-in. This plug-in includes the `JWT` token as part of a structure object with a single entry and a pre-configured name. Use `0` to specify that you will only access the single entry.

The resulting value is a structure for which you will resolve two fields:

* `azp`: The value where `app_id` is found.
* `aud`: The value where this information can also be found.

The operation ensures only one value is held for assignment.

[id="picking-up-the-jwt-token-from-a-header_{context}"]
== Picking up the JWT token from a header
Some setups might have validation processes for `JWT` tokens where the validated token would reach this module via a header in JSON format.

To get the `app_id`, see the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
credentials:
  app_id:
    - header:
        keys:
          - x-jwt-payload
        ops:
          - base64_urlsafe
          - json:
            - keys:
              - azp
              - aud
          - take:
              head: 1
