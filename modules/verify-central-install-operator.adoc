= Verifying Central installation using the Operator method

After Central finishes installing, log in to the {product-title-short} portal to verify the successful installation of Central.

.Procedure
. On the {ocp} web console, navigate to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page.
. Select the {product-title} Operator from the list of installed Operators.
. Select the *Central* tab.
. From the *Centrals* list, select `stackrox-central-services` to view its details.
. To get the password for the `admin` user, you can either:
* Click the link under **Admin Password Secret Reference**.
* Use the {osp} CLI to enter the command listed under **Admin Credentials Info**:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n stackrox get secret central-htpasswd -o go-template='{{index .data "password" | base64decode}}'
----
. Find the link to the {product-title-short} portal by using the {osp} CLI command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n stackrox get route central -o jsonpath="{.status.ingress[0].host}"
----
Alternatively, you can use the {product-title} web console to find the link to the {product-title-short} portal by performing the following commands:
.. Navigate to *Networking* -> *Routes*.
.. Find the *central* Route and click on the {product-title-short} portal link under the *Location* column.
. Log in to the {product-title-short} portal using the username *admin* and the password that you retrieved in a previous step. Until {product-title-short} is completely configured (for example, you have the `Central` resource and at least one `SecuredCluster` resource installed and configured), no data is available in the dashboard. The `SecuredCluster` resource can be installed and configured on the same cluster as the `Central` resource. Clusters with the `SecuredCluster` resource are similar to managed clusters in {rh-rhacm-first}.

.Next Steps
. Optional: Configure central settings.
. Generate an init bundle containing the cluster secrets that allows communication between the `Central` and `SecuredCluster` resources. You need to download this bundle, use it to generate resources on the clusters you want to secure, and securely store it.
. Install secured cluster services on each cluster you want to monitor.
