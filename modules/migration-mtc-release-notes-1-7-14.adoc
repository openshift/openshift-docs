.CVE-2023-39325 CVE-2023-44487: various flaws

A flaw was found in the handling of multiplexed streams in the HTTP/2 protocol, which is utilized by {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}). A client could repeatedly make a request for a new multiplex stream then immediately send an `RST_STREAM` frame to cancel those requests. This activity created additional workloads for the server in terms of setting up and dismantling streams, but avoided any server-side limitations on the maximum number of active streams per connection. As a result, a denial of service occurred due to server resource consumption.

.CVE-2023-39318 CVE-2023-39319 CVE-2023-39321: various flaws

* link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-39318[(CVE-2023-39318)]: A flaw was discovered in Golang, utilized by {mtc-short}. The `html/template` package did not properly handle HTML-like `""` comment tokens, or the hashbang `"#!"` comment tokens, in `<script>` contexts. This flaw could cause the template parser to improperly interpret the contents of `<script>` contexts, causing actions to be improperly escaped.

* link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-39319[(CVE-2023-39319)]: A flaw was discovered in Golang, utilized by {mtc-short}. The `html/template` package did not apply the proper rules for handling occurrences of `"<script"`, `"<!--"`, and `"</script"` within JavaScript literals in <script> contexts. This could cause the template parser to improperly consider script contexts to be terminated early, causing actions to be improperly escaped.

* link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-39322[(CVE-2023-3932)]: A flaw was discovered in Golang, utilized by {mtc-short}. Connections using the QUIC transport protocol did not set an upper bound on the amount of data buffered when reading post-handshake messages, allowing a malicious QUIC connection to cause unbounded memory growth.

To resolve these issues, upgrade to {mtc-short} 1.7.14.
