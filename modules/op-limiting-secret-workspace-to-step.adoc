= Limiting a secret to particular steps using workspaces

When you provide authentication secrets using workspaces and define the workspace in a task, by default the workspace is available to all steps in the task.

To limit a secret to specific steps, define the workspace both in the task specification and in the step specification.

.Procedure

* Add the `workspaces:` definition under both the task specification and the step specification, as in the following example:

----
<1> The definition of the `ssh-directory` workspace in the task specification.
<2> The definition of the `ssh-directory` workspace in the step specification. The authentication information is available to this step as the `$(workspaces.ssh-directory.path)` directory.
<3> As this step does not include a definition of the `ssh-directory` workspace, the authentication information is not available to this step.
