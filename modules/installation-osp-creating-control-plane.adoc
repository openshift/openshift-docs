= Creating the control plane machines

Create three control plane machines by using the Ignition config files that you generated.

.Prerequisites
* The infrastructure ID from the installation program's metadata file is set as an environment variable (`$INFRA_ID`)
* The `inventory.yaml` and `common.yaml` Ansible playbooks in a common directory
** If you need these files, copy them from *Creating network resources*
* The three Ignition files created in *Creating control plane Ignition config files*

.Procedure

. On a command line, change the working directory to the location of the `inventory.yaml` and `common.yaml` files.

. If the control plane Ignition config files aren't already in your working directory, copy them into it.

. Insert the following content into a local file that is called `04_control-plane.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.4/upi/openstack/04_control-plane.yaml[]
----

. On a command line, run the playbook:
+
----
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml 04_control-plane.yaml
----

. Run the following command to monitor the bootstrapping process:
+
----
$ openshift-install wait-for bootstrap-complete
----
+
You will see messages that confirm that the control plane machines are running and have joined the cluster:
+
----
INFO API v1.14.6+f9b5405 up
INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for bootstrapping to complete...
...
INFO It is now safe to remove the bootstrap resources
