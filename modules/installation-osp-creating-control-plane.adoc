= Creating the control plane machines

Create three control plane machines by using the Ignition config files that you generated.

.Prerequisites
* The infrastructure ID from the installation program's metadata file is set as an environment variable (`$INFRA_ID`)
* The `inventory.yaml` and `common.yaml` Ansible playbooks in a common directory
** If you need these files, copy them from *Creating network resources*
* The three Ignition files created in *Creating control plane Ignition config files*

.Procedure

. On a command line, change the working directory to the location of the `inventory.yaml` and `common.yaml` files.

. If the control plane Ignition config files aren't already in your working directory, copy them into it.

. Insert the following content into a local file that is called `control-plane.yaml`:
+
.`control-plane.yaml`
