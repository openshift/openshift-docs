|Component |Direction |Interacts with |Description

|Central
|⮂
|Scanner
|There is bidirectional communication between Central and Scanner.
Central requests image scans from Scanner, and Scanner requests updates to its CVE database from Central.

|Central
|➞
|`definitions.stackrox.io`
|Central connects to the `definitions.stackrox.io` endpoint to receive the aggregated vulnerability information.

|Central
|➞
|`collector-modules.stackrox.io`
|Central downloads supported kernel modules from `collector-modules.stackrox.io`.

|Central
|➞
|Image registries
|Central queries the image registries to get image metadata.
For example, to show Dockerfile instructions in the {product-title-short} portal.

|Scanner
|➞
|Image registries
|Scanner pulls images from the image registry to identify vulnerabilities.

|Sensor
|⮂
|Central
|There is bidirectional communication between Central and Sensor.
Sensor polls Central periodically for downloading updates for the sensor bundle configuration.
It also sends events for the observed activity for the secured cluster and observed policy violations.
Central communicates with Sensor to force reprocessing of all deployments against enabled policies.

|Sensor
|⮂
|Scanner
|Only in {ocp}, Sensor communicates with Scanner to access the local registry attached to the cluster.
Scanner communicates with Sensor to request data from `definitions.stackrox.io`.

|Collector
|⮂
|Sensor
|Collector communicates with Sensor and sends all of the events to the respective Sensor for the cluster.
Collector also requests missing drivers from Sensor.
Sensor requests compliance scan results from Collector. Additionally, Sensor receives external Classless Inter-Domain Routing information from Central and pushes it to the Collector.

|Admission controller
|⮂
|Sensor
|Sensors send the list of security policies to enforce to the Admission controller.
Admission controller sends security policy violation alerts to Sensor.
Admission controller can also request image scans from Sensor when required.

|Admission controller
|➞
|Central
|It is not common; however, Admission controller can communicate with Central directly if the Central endpoint is known and Sensor is unavailable.
