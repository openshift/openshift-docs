= Export enriched network flow data

You can send network flows to Kafka, IPFIX, or both at the same time. Any processor or storage that supports Kafka or IPFIX input, such as Splunk, Elasticsearch, or Fluentd, can consume the enriched network flow data.

.Prerequisites
* Your Kafka or IPFIX collector endpoint(s) are available from Network Observability `flowlogs-pipeline` pods.

.Procedure

. In the web console, navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
. Under the *Provided APIs* heading for the *NetObserv Operator*, select *Flow Collector*.
. Select *cluster* and then select the *YAML* tab.
. Edit the `FlowCollector` to configure `spec.exporters` as follows:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: flows.netobserv.io/v1alpha1
kind: FlowCollector
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  exporters:
  - type: KAFKA                         <3>
      kafka:
        address: "kafka-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.netobserv"
        topic: netobserv-flows-export   <1>
        tls:
          enable: false                 <2>
  - type: IPFIX                         <3>
      ipfix:
        targetHost: "ipfix-collector.ipfix.svc.cluster.local"
        targetPort: 4739
        transport: tcp or udp           <4>


----
<1> The Network Observability Operator exports all flows to the configured Kafka topic.
<2> You can encrypt all communications to and from Kafka with SSL/TLS or mTLS. When enabled, the Kafka CA certificate must be available as a ConfigMap or a Secret, both in the namespace where the `flowlogs-pipeline` processor component is deployed (default: netobserv). It must be referenced with `spec.exporters.tls.caCert`. When using mTLS, client secrets must be available in these namespaces as well (they can be generated for instance using the AMQ Streams User Operator) and referenced with `spec.exporters.tls.userCert`.
<3> You can export flows to IPFIX instead of or in conjunction with exporting flows to Kafka.
<4> You have the option to specify transport. The default value is `tcp` but you can also specify `udp`.
. After configuration, network flows data can be sent to an available output in a JSON format. For more information, see _Network flows format reference_.
