= Configuring PTP log reduction

The `linuxptp-daemon` generates logs that you can use for debugging purposes. In telco or other deployment types that feature a limited storage capacity, these logs can add to the storage demand. Currently, the default logging rate is high, causing logs to rotate out in under 24 hours, which makes it difficult to track changes and identify problems.

You can achieve basic log reduction by configuring the `PtpConfig` custom resource (CR) to exclude log messages that report the master offset value. The master offset log message reports the difference between the clock of the current node and the master clock in nanoseconds. However, with this method, there is no summary status of filtered logs. The enhanced log reduction feature allows you to configure the logging rate of PTP logs. You can set a specific logging rate, which can help reduce the volume of logs generated by the `linuxptp-daemon` while still retaining essential information for troubleshooting. With the enhanced log reduction feature, you can also specify a threshold that still displays the offset logs if the offset is higher than that threshold.
