== Fixed issues

TargetDown alert triggered after upgrade is resolved::
Before this update, upgrading from 1.17.2 to 1.17.3 triggered the `TargetDown` alert due to a 403 forbidden response from the metrics endpoint. With this update, role-based access control (RBAC) permissions explicitly allow access to the `/metrics` non-resource URL by using `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` objects. As a result, Prometheus successfully scrapes metrics and resolves the `TargetDown` alert.

The `redis-ha-haproxy` deployment now synchronizes replica counts during upgrades::
Before this update, during Operator upgrades, the `redis-ha-haproxy` deployment kept an outdated replica configuration. As a consequence, the deployment did not automatically reflect the desired state. With this update, the deployment synchronizes the replica count during the reconciliation process. As a result, `redis-ha-haproxy` replicas remain synchronized with the configuration across upgrades.

Argo CD now applies the `ignoreDifferences` setting to cluster-scoped resources::
Before this update, the `ignoreDifferences` setting in an Argo CD application was not applied to cluster-scoped resources, such as `OAuthClient`. This occurred because a bug in the Argo CD codebase prevented the resource from being ignored when the namespace was empty. With this update, the internal logic is corrected to include resources with empty namespaces. As a result, the `ignoreDifferences` setting applies to both namespace-scoped and cluster-scoped resources.
