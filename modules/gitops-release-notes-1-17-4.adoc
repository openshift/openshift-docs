= Release notes for {gitops-title} 1.17.4

{gitops-title} 1.17.4 is now available on {OCP} 4.12, 4.14, 4.15, 4.16, 4.17, 4.18, and 4.19.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After completing the upgrade, run the `audit-operator-roles.sh` audit script to review namespace-scoped access created by the {gitops-title} Operator. The script identifies `Role` and `RoleBinding` objects that grant cross-namespace access when the _Applications in any namespace_ feature or _ApplicationSets in any namespace_ feature is enabled using the Argo CD custom resource (CR) (`.spec.sourceNamespaces` and `.spec.applicationSet.sourceNamespaces`). These features are disabled by default. The script scans all namespaces and reports `Role`/`RoleBinding` combinations that meet the following conditions:

* Grant access to the `argoproj.io/Application` resource
* Are labeled with `app.kubernetes.io/part-of=argocd`
* Bind to a service account in a different namespace, resulting in cross-namespace access

Review the script output to ensure that cross-namespace access is limited to the intended namespaces only.

For more information about the script, see link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/gitops-operator/blob/master/scripts/audit-namespace-roles/audit-operator-roles.sh[Audit Operator script].

For more information about the steps to execute the script, see link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/gitops-operator/blob/master/scripts/audit-namespace-roles/README.md[Audit Operator script readme].

== Fixed issues

TargetDown alert triggered after upgrade is resolved::
Before this update, upgrading from 1.17.2 to 1.17.3 triggered the `TargetDown` alert due to a 403 forbidden response from the metrics endpoint. With this update, RBAC is explicitly updated to allow access to the `/metrics` non-resource URL using the appropriate `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding`, enabling Prometheus to successfully scrape metrics and resolve the `TargetDown` alert.
