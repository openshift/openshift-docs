= Installation process overview

You can install {product-title} on {oci-c3} by using the {ai-full}. The installation process provisions three control plane (master) nodes and three compute (worker) nodes, together with the external and internal Load Balancers that form the cluster. This is the standard implementation for {oci-first-no-rt}.

For an alternative installation method, see "Installing a cluster on {oci-c3} by using the Agent-based Installer".

.Preinstallation considerations

* Ensure that your installation meets the prerequisites specified for Oracle. For details, see the "Access and Considerations" section in the link:https://www.oracle.com/a/otn/docs/compute_cloud_at_customer_assisted_installer.pdf?source=:em:nl:mt::::PCATP[Oracle documentation].

* Ensure that your infrastructure is certified and uses a compatible cloud instance type. For details, see link:https://catalog.redhat.com/cloud/detail/216977[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure].

* Ensure that you are performing the installation on a virtual machine.

.Installation process workflow

The following workflow describes a high-level outline for installing an {product-title} on {oci-c3-short} using the {ai-full}:

. Prepare the {oci-c3-short} bastion server (Oracle).

. Create the `createIdentityResources.tf` script in the Home region (Oracle):

.. Copy the Identity resources from GitHub to the bastian server (Oracle).

.. Modify the `terraform.tfvars` as instructed (Oracle). 

.. Run the `Terraform Init`, `Terraform Plan`, `Terraform Apply` commands in the home region.

. Create the `createInfraResources.tf` script in the {oci-c3-short} region (Oracle).

. Generate the {product-title} Discovery image in the {ai-full} web console (Red{nbsp}Hat).

. Convert and upload the image to {oci-first-no-rt} (Oracle).

. Copy the Infrastructure Terraform files from GitHub to the bastion server (Oracle).

. Modify the `terraform.tfvars` on the bastion server as instructed, including the converted Discovery image (Oracle).

. Run the `Terraform Init`, `Terraform Plan`, `Terraform Apply` commands in the {oci-c3-short} region (Oracle).

. Tag the control plane (master) nodes and the compute (worker) nodes with your cluster {product-title} name (Oracle).

. Use the script output to update the custom manifest files to be uploaded to the {product-title} console (Oracle).

. Assign node roles to control plane (master) and compute (worker) nodes (Red{nbsp}Hat). Remove disconnected nodes.

. Configure networking by adding the NTP sources for any failed hosts (Red{nbsp}Hat).

. Add the custom manifests through the {ai} web console (Red{nbsp}Hat).

. Open {product-title} from the {oci-first-no-rt} web console (Oracle).
