= Installation process overview

You can install {product-title} on {oci-c3} by using the {ai-full}. The installation process provisions three control plane (master) nodes and three compute (worker) nodes, together with the external and internal Load Balancers that form the cluster. This is the standard implementation for {oci-first-no-rt}.

For an alternative installation method, see "Installing a cluster on {oci-c3} by using the Agent-based Installer".

.Preinstallation considerations

* Ensure that your installation meets the prerequisites specified for Oracle. For details, see the "Access and Considerations" section in the link:https://www.oracle.com/a/otn/docs/compute_cloud_at_customer_assisted_installer.pdf?source=:em:nl:mt::::PCATP[Oracle documentation].

* Ensure that your infrastructure is certified and uses a compatible cloud instance type. For details, see link:https://catalog.redhat.com/cloud/detail/216977[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure].

* Ensure that you are performing the installation on a virtual machine.

.Installation process workflow

The following workflow describes a high-level outline for installing an {product-title} on {oci-c3-short} using the {ai-full}:

. Prepare the {oci-c3-short} bastion server (Oracle).

. Copy the `createInfraResources.tf` and `terraform.tfvars` Terraform scripts onto the bastion server.

. Run the `createInfraResources.tf` script via the Home region (Oracle).

. Generate the {product-title} image in the {ai-full} web console (Red{nbsp}Hat). 

. Convert and upload the image to {oci-first-no-rt} (Oracle).

. Run the `terraform.tfvars` script via the {oci-c3-short} region (Oracle).

. Complete the cluster installation by using the {ai-full} web console:

.. Assign node roles to control plane (master) and compute (worker) nodes  (Red{nbsp}Hat).

.. Configure networking by adding the NTP sources for any failed hosts  (Red{nbsp}Hat).

.. Create the custom manifests (Oracle) and add them through the {ai} web console (Red{nbsp}Hat).

. Open {product-title} from the {oci-first-no-rt} web console (Oracle).
