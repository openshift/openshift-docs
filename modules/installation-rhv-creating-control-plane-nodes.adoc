= Creating the control plane nodes

You create the control plane nodes by running the `masters.yml` playbook. This playbook passes the `master.ign` Ignition file to each of the virtual machines. The Ignition file contains a directive for the control plane node to get the Ignition from a URL such as `https://api-int.ocp4.example.org:22623/config/master`. The port number in this URL is managed by the load balancer, and is accessible only inside the cluster.

.Procedure

. Create the control plane nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml masters.yml
----

. While the playbook creates your control plane, monitor the bootstrapping process:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install wait-for bootstrap-complete --dir $ASSETS_DIR
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
INFO API v1.18.3+b74c5ed up
