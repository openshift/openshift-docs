= Deleting Operators from a cluster using the web console

Cluster administrators can delete installed Operators from a selected namespace
by using the web console.

.Prerequisites

- Access to an {product-title} cluster web console using an account with
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin[]
`cluster-admin` permissions.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
`dedicated-admins-cluster` permissions.
endif::[]

.Procedure

. From the *Operators* â†’ *Installed Operators* page, scroll or type a keyword into
the *Filter by name* to find the Operator you want. Then, click on it.

. On the right-hand side of the *Operator Details* page, select *Uninstall
Operator* from the *Actions* drop-down menu.

. When prompted by the *Remove Operator Subscription* window, you can select the
*Also completely remove the Operator from the selected namespace* check box to
remove all components related to the Operator. This removes the CSV, which
in turn removes the Pods, Deployments, CRDs, and CRs associated with the
Operator. Leaving this unchecked results in only the Subscription being removed.

. Select *Remove*. This Operator will stop running and no longer receive updates.
