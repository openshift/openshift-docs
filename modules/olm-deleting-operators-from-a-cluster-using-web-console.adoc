.Procedure

. Navigate to the *Operators* â†’ *Installed Operators* page.

. Scroll or enter a keyword into the *Filter by name* field to find the Operator that you want to remove. Then, click on it.

. On the right side of the *Operator Details* page, select *Uninstall Operator* from the *Actions* list.
+
An *Uninstall Operator?* dialog box is displayed.

[NOTE]
====
This action does not remove resources managed by the Operator, including custom resource definitions (CRDs) and custom resources (CRs). Dashboards and navigation items enabled by the web console and off-cluster resources that continue to run might need manual clean up. To remove these after uninstalling the Operator, you might need to manually delete the Operator CRDs.
