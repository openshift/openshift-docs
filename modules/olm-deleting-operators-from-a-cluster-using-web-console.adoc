*Removing the Operator will not remove any of its custom resource definitions or
managed resources. If your Operator has deployed applications on the cluster or
configured off-cluster resources, these will continue to run and need to be
cleaned up manually.*
--
+
The Operator, any Operator deployments, and pods are removed by this action. Any
resources managed by the Operator, including CRDs and CRs are not removed. The
web console enables dashboards and navigation items for some Operators. To
remove these after uninstalling the Operator, you might need to manually delete
the Operator CRDs.

. Select *Uninstall*. This Operator stops running and no longer receives updates.
