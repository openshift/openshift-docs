*Removing the Operator will not remove any of its custom resource definitions or managed resources. If your Operator has deployed applications on the cluster or configured off-cluster resources, these will continue to run and need to be cleaned up manually.*
--

The Operator, any Operator deployments, and pods are removed by this action. Any resources managed by the Operator, including CRDs and CRs, are not removed. The web console enables dashboards and navigation items for some Operators. To remove these after uninstalling the Operator, you might need to manually delete the Operator CRDs.

. Select *Uninstall*. This Operator stops running and no longer receives updates.
