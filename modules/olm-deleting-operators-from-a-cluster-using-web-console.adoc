= Deleting Operators from a cluster using the web console

Cluster administrators can delete installed Operators from a selected namespace by using the web console.

.Prerequisites

- Access to an {product-title} cluster web console using an account with
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin[]
`cluster-admin` permissions.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
`dedicated-admins-cluster` permissions.
endif::[]

.Procedure

. From the *Operators* â†’ *Installed Operators* page, scroll or enter a keyword into the *Filter by name* field to find the Operator you want. Then, click on it.

. On the right side of the *Operator Details* page, select *Uninstall Operator* from the *Actions* drop-down menu.
+
An *Uninstall Operator?* dialog box opens, listing the Operands associated with the Operator.
+
. Choose one of the following options for the *Delete all operand instances for this Operator* checkbox:

* To remove Operands managed by the Operator automatically, including custom resources (CRs), select the checkbox.
* To keep the Operands in place or remove them manually later, leave the checkbox clear.
. Select *Uninstall* to remove the Operator, any Operator deployments, and pods. This Operator stops running and no longer receives updates.

.Verification

- If you choose to remove Operands managed by the Operator automatically, the *Uninstall Operator?* dialog box confirms if the uninstall process is a success. If there are errors, the dialog lists the Operands that you need to delete manually.

[NOTE]
====
Dashboards and navigation items enabled by the web console and off-cluster resources that continue to run might need manual clean up.
