Cluster administrators can delete installed Operators from a selected namespace by using the web console.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin[]
`cluster-admin` permissions.
endif::[]

`dedicated-admins-cluster` permissions.
endif::[]

*Operator VerticalPodAutoscaler will be removed from openshift-vertical-pod-autoscaler. Click on the checkbox below to also remove all Operands associated with this Operator. If your Operator configured off-cluster resources, these will continue to run and require manual cleanup.*

Any resources managed by the Operator, including CRDs and CRs, are not removed. The web console enables dashboards and navigation items for some Operators. To remove these after uninstalling the Operator, you might need to manually delete the Operator CRDs.

. Optional: To remove all operands associated with the Operator, select *Delete all operand instances for this operator* checkbox.

. Select *Uninstall*. This Operator stops running and no longer receives updates.
