= About sos reports

[role="_abstract"]
You can use an sos report to troubleshoot a failing host or problems with {gitops-title}. The `sos` tool combines plugins that help you gather information from different applications. The `sos report` command generates a detailed report that shows all of the enabled plugins and data from the different components and applications in a system.

A {microshift-short}-specific plugin from sos version 4.5.1 gathers the following data:

* {microshift-short} configuration and version
* YAML output for node and system namespaced resources
* OVN-Kubernetes information
