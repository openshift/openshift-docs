= About Google authentication

Using Google as an identity provider allows any Google user to authenticate to your server. You can limit authentication to members of a specific hosted domain with the `hostedDomain` configuration attribute.

[NOTE]
====
Using Google as an identity provider requires users to get a token using `<namespace_route>/oauth/token/request` to use with command-line tools.
