= Configure MetalLB address pool for VLAN

As a cluster administrator, you can add address pools to your cluster to control the IP addresses on a created VLAN that MetalLB can assign to load-balancer services

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* Configure a separate VLAN.

* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Create a file, such as `ipaddresspool-vlan.yaml`, that is similar to the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  namespace: metallb-system
  name: doc-example-vlan
  labels: 
    zone: east <1>
spec:
  addresses:
  - 192.168.100.1-192.168.100.254 <2>
----
<1> This label assigned to the `IPAddressPool` can be referenced by the `ipAddressPoolSelectors` in the `BGPAdvertisement` CRD to associate the `IPAddressPool` with the advertisement.
<2> This IP range must match the subnet assigned to the VLAN on your network. To support layer 2 (L2) mode, the IP address range must be within the same subnet as the cluster nodes.

. Apply the configuration for the IP address pool:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f ipaddresspool-vlan.yaml
----

. To ensure this configuration applies to the VLAN you need to set the `spec` `gatewayConfig.ipForwarding` to `Global`. 
+
.. Run the following command to edit the network configuration custom resource (CR):
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit network.operator.openshift/cluster
----
+
.. Update the `spec.defaultNetwork.ovnKubernetesConfig` section to include the `gatewayConfig.ipForwarding` set to `Global`. It should look something like this:
+
.Example
[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
  clusterNetwork:
    - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
      hostPrefix: 23
  defaultNetwork:
    type: OVNKubernetes
    ovnKubernetesConfig:
      gatewayConfig:
        ipForwarding: Global
...
