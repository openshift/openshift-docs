== Bug fixes

* Before this update, buffer corruption following an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) event caused deserialization errors that blocked log forwarding and reduced {LoggingProductName} resilience.
This update improves the recovery logic for corrupted buffer files and prevents log forwarding issues after OOM events.
The collector now successfully recovers from OOM events and subsequent buffer corruption, ensuring continuous log forwarding.
