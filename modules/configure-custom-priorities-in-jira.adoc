= Configuring custom priorities in Jira

If you are using custom priorities in your Jira project, you can configure them in {product-title}.

.Procedure
. While configuring Jira integration in {product-title}, turn on the *Priority Mapping* toggle. {product-title} gets the JIRA project schema, and auto fills the values for the *CRITICAL_SEVERITY*, *HIGH_SEVERITY*, *MEDIUM_SEVERITY*, and *LOW_SEVERITY* fields.
. Verify or update the priority values based on your JIRA project configuration.
. Select *Test* to test that the integration with Jira is working.
. Select *Create* to generate the configuration.
