= Monitoring managed cluster installation progress

The ArgoCD pipeline uses the `SiteConfig` CR to generate the cluster configuration CRs and syncs it with the hub cluster. You can monitor the progress of the synchronization in the ArgoCD dashboard.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

When the synchronization is complete, the installation generally proceeds as follows:

. The Assisted Service Operator installs {product-title} on the cluster. You can monitor the progress of cluster installation from the {rh-rhacm} dashboard or from the command line by running the following commands:

.. Export the cluster name:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export CLUSTER=<clusterName>
----

.. Query the `AgentClusterInstall` CR for the managed cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get agentclusterinstall -n $CLUSTER $CLUSTER -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Completed")]}' | jq
----

.. Get the installation events for the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -sk $(oc get agentclusterinstall -n $CLUSTER $CLUSTER -o jsonpath='{.status.debugInfo.eventsURL}')  | jq '.[-2,-1]'
----
