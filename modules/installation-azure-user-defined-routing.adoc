= User-defined outbound routing

In {product-title}, you can choose your own outbound routing for a cluster to
connect to the Internet. This allows you to skip the creation of public IP
addresses and the public load balancer.

You can configure user-defined routing by modifying parameters in the
`install-config.yaml` file before installing your cluster. A pre-existing VNet
is required to use outbound routing when installing a cluster; the installation
program is not responsible for configuring this.

When configuring a cluster to use user-defined routing, the installation program
does not create the following resources:

* Outbound rules for access to the Internet.
* Public IPs for the public load balancer.
* Kubernetes Service object to add the cluster machines to the public load
balancer for outbound requests.

You must ensure the following items are available before setting user-defined
routing:

* Egress to the Internet is possible to pull container images, unless using an
internal registry mirror.
* The cluster can access Azure APIs.
* Various allowlist endpoints are configured. You can reference these endpoints
in the _Configuring your firewall_ section.

There are several pre-existing networking setups that are supported for Internet
access using user-defined routing.

[discrete]
== Private cluster with network address translation

You can use link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/nat-overview[Azure VNET network address translation (NAT)]
to provide outbound Internet access for the subnets in your cluster. You can
reference
link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/quickstart-create-nat-gateway-cli[Create a NAT gateway using Azure CLI]
in the Azure documentation for configuration instructions.

When using a VNet setup with Azure NAT and user-defined routing configured, you
can create a private cluster with no public endpoints. 

[discrete]
== Private cluster with Azure Firewall

You can use Azure Firewall to provide outbound routing for the VNet used to
install the cluster. You can learn more about
link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/egress-outboundtype#deploy-a-cluster-with-outbound-type-of-udr-and-azure-firewall[providing user-defined routing with Azure Firewall]
in the Azure documentation.

When using a VNet setup with Azure Firewall and user-defined routing configured,
you can create a private cluster with no public endpoints.

[discrete]
== Private cluster with a proxy configuration

You can use a proxy with user-defined routing to allow egress to the Internet.
You must ensure that cluster Operators do not access Azure APIs using a
proxy; Operators must have access to Azure APIs outside of the proxy.

When using the default route table for subnets, with `0.0.0.0/0` populated
automatically by Azure, all Azure API requests are routed over Azure's internal
network even though the IP addresses are public. As long as the Network Security
Group rules allow egress to Azure API endpoints, proxies with user-defined
routing configured allow you to create private clusters with no public
endpoints.

[discrete]
== Private cluster with no Internet access

You can have VNets with no access to the Internet if your cluster has access to
the following:

* An internal registry mirror that allows for pulling container images
* Access to Azure APIs

With these requirements available, you can use user-defined routing to create
private clusters with no public endpoints.
