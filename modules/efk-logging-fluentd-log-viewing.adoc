= Viewing Fluentd logs

How you view logs depends upon the `LOGGING_FILE_PATH` setting.

* If `LOGGING_FILE_PATH` points to a file, use the *logs* utility to print out the contents of Fluentd log files:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc exec <pod> -- logs <1>
----
<1> Specify the name of the Fluentd pod. Note the space before `logs`.
+
For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc exec logging-fluentd-lmvms -- logs
----
+
The contents of log files are printed out, starting with the oldest log.  Use `-f` option to follow what is being written into the logs.

* If you are using `LOGGING_FILE_PATH=console`,  Fluentd writes logs to its default location, `/var/log/fluentd/fluentd.log`. You can retrieve the logs with the `oc logs -f <pod_name>` command.
+
For example
+
[source,bash]
----
oc logs -f fluentd.log
----
