Telemetry collects the following information:

* API, `roxctl` CLI, and user interface (UI) features and settings to know how you use {rh-rhacs-first}, which helps prioritize efforts.
* The time you spend on UI screens to help us improve user experience.
* The integrations are used to know if there are integrations that you have never used.
* The number of connected secured clusters and their configurations.
* Errors you encounter to identify the most common problems.
