== Node management in {product-title}

{product-title} version 4.0 integrates management of
the container operating system and cluster management. Because the cluster manages
its updates, including updates to {op-system-first} on cluster nodes, {product-title} provides an opinionated
lifecycle management experience that simplifies the orchestration of upgrades.

{product-title} employs three DaemonSets and controllers to simplify node management:

* The `machine-config-controller` coordinates machine upgrades.
* The `machine-config-daemon` DaemonSet is a subset of the Ignition configuration that
applies the specified machine configuration and controls kubelet configuration.
* The `machine-config-server` DaemonSet provides the Ignition config to new hosts.

These tools orchestrate operating system updates and configuration changes to
the hosts by using standard Kuberentes-style constructs. A `machine-config-daemon`
DaemonSet runs on each machine in the cluster and watches for changes in
the machine configuration for it to apply. The machine configuration is a subset
of the Ignition configuration. The `machine-config-daemon` reads the machine configuration to see
if it needs to do an OSTree update, if it should apply a series of systemd
kubelet file changes, configuration changes, or other changes to the
operating system or {product-title} configuration.

The masters also run the `machine-config-controller` process that monitors all of the cluster nodes
and orchestrates their configuration updates. So if you try to apply
an update or configuration change to a node on the cluster, the `machine-config-controller`
directs a node to update. The node sees that it needs to change, drains off its
pods, applies the update, and reboots. This process is key to the success of
managing {product-title} and {op-system} updates together.

The `machine-config-server` provides configurations to nodes as they join the
cluster. It orchestrates configuration to nodes and changes to the operating system
and is used in both cluster installation and node maintenance. The
`machine-config-server` components upgrade the operating system and controls the Ignition
configuration for nodes.

////
The `bootkube` process calls the `machine-config-server` component when the
{product-title} installer bootstraps the initial master node. After installation,
the `machine-config-server` runs in the cluster.  It reads the `machine-config`
Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and serves the required Ignition configurations
to new nodes when they join the cluster.
////

When you perform node management operations, you will be creating or
modifying a KubeletConfig Custom Resource (CR).

== Machine Configs and Machine Config Pools
Machine Config Pools manage a cluster of nodes and their corresponding
Machine Configs. Machine Configs contain configuration information for a
cluster.
