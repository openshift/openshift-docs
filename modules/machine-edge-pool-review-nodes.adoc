= Verifying nodes that were created with edge compute pool

After your install a cluster that uses AWS Local Zones, check the status of the machine that was created by the machine set manifests created at install time.

. To check the machine sets created from the subnet you added to the `install-config.yaml` file, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machineset -n openshift-machine-api --show-labels
----
