= Verifying nodes that were created with edge compute pool

After you install a cluster that uses AWS {zone-type} infrastructure, check the status of the machine that was created by the machine set manifests created during installation.

. To check the machine sets created from the subnet you added to the `install-config.yaml` file, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machineset -n openshift-machine-api

ifdef::local-zone[]
