= Configuring cluster details and choosing Operators to install

[role="_abstract"]
Once the rendezvous node has been booted from the ISO image, configure details about your cluster and choose Virtualization Operators to install from the web console.

.Prerequisites

* You have the URL of the installation web console that was provided by the rendezvous node.

.Procedure

. In a web browser, go to the URL provided by the rendezvous node.

. Configure your cluster in the *Cluster details* page:

.. Enter a name for the cluster in the *Cluster name* field.

.. Enter a base domain for the cluster in the *Base domain* field.
All subdomains for the cluster will use this base domain.
+
[NOTE]
====
The base domain must be a valid DNS name.
You must not have a wildcard domain set up for the base domain.
====

.. Enter your pull secret in the *Pull secret* field.
You can obtain a copy of your pull secret from the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[{hybrid-console}].

.. Optional: In the *Number of control plane nodes* field, select the number of control plane nodes for your installation from the dropdown menu.
The default value is `3`.

.. Optional: Select the *Include custom manifests* checkbox if you want to upload custom manifests to further configure your cluster.
This option adds an additional page for custom manifests that you use later in the configuration process.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have already added custom manifests, clearing the *Include custom manifests* checkbox automatically deletes them all.
You must confirm the deletion.
====

.. Optional: Under *Encryption of installation disks*, select the toggle switch for each disk you want to encrypt.

.. If you are encrypting disks, select either *TPM v2* or *Tang* as your encryption method.

.. If you are encrypting disks using a Tang server, enter the **Server URL** and **Server Thumbprint** in the **Tang servers** section of the page. You can select **Add another Tang server** to configure details for additional Tang server.

.. Click *Next* to continue.
Once you proceed to the next page, you cannot go back to change any of these cluster details.

. Choose additional Operators to install in the *Operators* page:

.. If you want to install all of the Operators recommended for running Virtualization on your cluster, select *Virtualization* in the *Bundles* section.

.. If you want to install only some Operators, select the individual Operators from the Single Operators section.
+
[NOTE]
====
Some of the listed Operators are available only as part of the Virtualization Operator bundle.
====

.. Click *Next* to continue.
