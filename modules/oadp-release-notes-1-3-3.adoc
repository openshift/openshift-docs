{oadp-short} image PullPolicy set to `Always`::
In previous versions of {oadp-short}, the image PullPolicy of the adp-controller-manager and Velero pods was set to `Always`. This was problematic in edge scenarios where there could be limited network bandwidth to the registry, resulting in slow recovery time following a pod restart. In {oadp-short} 1.3.3, the image PullPolicy of the `openshift-adp-controller-manager` and Velero pods is set to `IfNotPresent`.

== Known issues

Cassandra application pods enter into the `CrashLoopBackoff` status after restoring OADP::
After {oadp-short} restores, the Cassandra application pods might enter in the `CrashLoopBackoff` status. To work around this problem, delete the `StatefulSet` pods that are returning an error or the `CrashLoopBackoff` state after restoring {oadp-short}. The `StatefulSet` controller recreates these pods and it runs normally.
