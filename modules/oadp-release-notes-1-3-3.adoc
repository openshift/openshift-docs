.{oadp-short} fails when its namespace name is longer than 37 characters

When installing the {oadp-short}  Operator in a namespace with more than 37 characters and when creating a new DPA, labeling the `cloud-credentials` secret fails. With this release, the issue has been fixed. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-4211[{oadp-short}-4211]

.{oadp-short} image PullPolicy set to `Always`

In previous versions of {oadp-short}, the image PullPolicy of the adp-controller-manager and Velero pods was set to `Always`. This was problematic in edge scenarios where there could be limited network bandwidth to the registry, resulting in slow recovery time following a pod restart. In {oadp-short} 1.3.3, the image PullPolicy of the `openshift-adp-controller-manager` and Velero pods is set to `IfNotPresent`.

== Known issues

.Cassandra application pods enter into the `CrashLoopBackoff` status after restoring OADP

After {oadp-short} restores, the Cassandra application pods might enter in the `CrashLoopBackoff` status. To work around this problem, delete the `StatefulSet` pods that are returning an error or the `CrashLoopBackoff` state after restoring {oadp-short}. The `StatefulSet` controller recreates these pods and it runs normally.
