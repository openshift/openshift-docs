= Setting a log level for cert-manager

You can set a log level for cert-manager to determine the verbosity of log messages.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have installed version 1.11.1 or later of the {cert-manager-operator}.

.Procedure

. Edit the `CertManager` resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit certmanager.operator cluster
----

. Set the log level value by editing the `spec.logLevel` section:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: CertManager
...
spec:
  logLevel: <log_level> <1>
----
<1> The valid log level values for the `CertManager` resource are `Normal`, `Debug`, `Trace`, and `TraceAll`. To audit logs and perform common operations when there are no issues, set `logLevel` to `Normal` . To troubleshoot a minor issue by viewing verbose logs, set `logLevel` to `Debug` . To troubleshoot a major issue by viewing more verbose logs, you can set `logLevel` to `Trace`. To troubleshoot serious issues, set `logLevel` to `TraceAll`. The default `logLevel` is `Normal`.
+
[NOTE]
====
`TraceAll` generates huge amount of logs. After setting `logLevel` to `TraceAll`, you might experience performance issues.
====

. Save your changes and quit the text editor to apply your changes.

After applying the changes, the verbosity level for the cert-manager components controller, CA injector, and webhook is updated.
