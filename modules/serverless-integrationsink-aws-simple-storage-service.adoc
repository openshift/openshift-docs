= AWS S3 with IntegrationSink

The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) Kamelet allows you to deliver CloudEvents from Knative Eventing into an Amazon S3 bucket. This integration makes it possible to store events as objects for long-term storage, analytics, or downstream processing.

To configure an `IntegrationSink` API for AWS S3, you must reference a Kubernetes Secret with valid AWS credentials, specify the Amazon S3 bucket Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and its region, and configure the source that produces the CloudEvents.
