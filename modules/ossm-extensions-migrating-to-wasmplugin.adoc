= Migrating to `WasmPlugin` resources

To upgrade your WebAssembly extensions from the `ServiceMeshExtension` API to the `WasmPlugin` API, you rename your plug-in file.

.Prerequisites

* `ServiceMeshControlPlane` is upgraded to version 2.2 or later.

[CAUTION]
====
Because both plug-ins will be called for every request, you might want to remove your existing `ServiceMeshExtension` resource before creating the new `WasmPlugin` resource. You might get undesired results having two plug-ins active at the same time.
====

.Procedure

. Update your container image. If the plug-in is already in `/plugin.wasm` inside the container, skip to the next step.  If not:

.. Ensure the plug-in file is named `plugin.wasm`. You must name the extension file `plugin.wasm`.

.. Ensure the plug-in file is located in the root (/) directory. You must store extension files in the root of the container filesystem..

.. Rebuild your container image and push it to a container registry.

. Remove the `ServiceMeshExtension` resource and create a `WasmPlugin` resource that refers to the new container image you built.
