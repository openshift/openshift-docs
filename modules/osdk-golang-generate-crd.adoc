= Generating CRD manifests

After the API is defined with `spec` and `status` fields and custom resource definition (CRD) validation markers, you can generate CRD manifests.

.Procedure

* Run the following command to generate and update CRD manifests:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ make manifests
----
+
This Makefile target invokes the `controller-gen` utility to generate the CRD manifests in the `config/crd/bases/cache.example.com_memcacheds.yaml` file.

== About OpenAPI validation

OpenAPIv3 schemas are added to CRD manifests in the `spec.validation` block when the manifests are generated. This validation block allows Kubernetes to validate the properties in a Memcached custom resource (CR) when it is created or updated.

Markers, or annotations, are available to configure validations for your API. These markers always have a `+kubebuilder:validation` prefix.
