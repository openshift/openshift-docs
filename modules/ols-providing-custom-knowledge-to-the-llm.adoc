= Providing custom knowledge to the LLM

[role="_abstract"]
To customize the data available to a large language model (LLM), you can provide access to a container image stored in a remote registry. This action allows the model to utilize specific content for more accurate results.

The examples in this procedure use `quay.io` as the remote container image registry. The path for the custom image is `quay.io/<username>/my-byok-image:latest`.

:FeatureName: The BYO Knowledge tool
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the {ocp-product-title} web console as a user account that has permission to create a cluster-scoped custom resource (CR) file, such as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

* You have an LLM provider available for use with the {ols-long} Service.

* You have installed the {ols-long} Operator.

* The custom information you want to add resides as a collection of Markdown files with `.md` extensions. No other file format is supported.

*  You have logged in to `registry.redhat.io` by using Podman.

* You have an account for a container image registry, such as `quay.io`.

.Procedure 

. Specify the location of the directory with the Markdown files for the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) database and the path for the image that the BYO Knowledge tool generates by running the following command: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman run -it --rm --device=/dev/fuse \
  -v $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/auth.json:/run/user/0/containers/auth.json:Z \
  -v <dir_tree_with_markdown_files>:/markdown:Z \
  -v <dir_for_image_tar>:/output:Z \
  registry.redhat.io/openshift-lightspeed-tech-preview/lightspeed-rag-tool-rhel9:latest
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The container image that the tool generates contains a custom RAG database. The RAG database provides additional information to the LLM. 
====

. Load the container image that the BYO Knowledge tool generated by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman load < <directory_for_image_tar>/<my-byok-image.tar>
----

. Display the podman images that are on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman images
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
REPOSITORY                            TAG                IMAGE ID      CREATED       SIZE
localhost/my-byok-image               latest             be7d1770bf10  1 minute  ago    2.37 GB
...
----

. Tag the local image with a name and destination so that the image can be pushed to the container image registry by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman tag localhost/my-byok-image:latest quay.io/<username>/my-byok-image:latest
----

. Push the local container image to the container image registry by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman push quay.io/<username>/my-byok-image:latest
----

. Modify the `OLSconfig` CR to deploy the newly created RAG database alongside the existing one:

.. In the {ocp-product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*. 

.. Select *All Projects* in the  *Project* dropdown at the top of the screen.

.. Click *{ols-long} Operator*.

.. Click *OLSConfig*, then click the `cluster` configuration instance in the list.

.. Click the *YAML* tab.

.. Insert the `spec.ols.rag` yaml code:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: ols.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: OLSConfig
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  ols:
    rag:
      - image: quay.io/<username>/my-byok-image:latest 
----
+
* `spec.ols.rag.image` specifies the tag for the image that was pushed to the image registry so that the {ols-long} Operator can access the custom content. The {ols-long} Operator can work with more than one RAG database that you create.

. Optional: Specify pull secrets in the `OLSSpec` section of the `OLSConfig` CR file. These secrets provide authentication for remote registries. Use this optional field if your RAG BYO Knowledge images reside in a private registry that the standard cluster-wide pull secret cannot access.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: ols.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: OLSConfig
metadata:
  name: cluster
  namespace: openshift-lightspeed
spec:
  llm:
    providers:
...
  ols:
    imagePullSecrets:
      - name: <my_pull_secret_1>
      - name: <my_pull_secret_2>
----
+ 
* `spec.ols.imagePullSecrets` defines the pull secrets that {ols-long} uses only when you specify BYO Knowledge RAG images. Instead of linking a specific secret to a specific image, the system maintains a general list of pull secrets. For every BYO Knowledge image, the system tries each pull secret in sequential order until it achieves a successful authentication.

. Click *Save*.

.Verification

* Access the {ols-long} virtual assistant and submit a question associated with the custom content that you provided to the LLM.
+
The {ols-long} virtual assistant generates a response based on the custom content.
