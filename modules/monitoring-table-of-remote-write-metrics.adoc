= Table of remote write metrics

The following table contains remote write and remote write-adjacent metrics with further description to help solve issues during remote write configuration.

[options="header"]
|===
| Metric | Description
| `prometheus_remote_storage_highest_timestamp_in_seconds` | Shows the newest timestamp that Prometheus stored in the write-ahead log (WAL) for any sample.
| `prometheus_remote_storage_queue_highest_sent_timestamp_seconds` | Shows the newest timestamp that the remote write queue successfully sent.
| `prometheus_remote_storage_samples_retried_total` | The number of samples that remote write failed to send and had to resend to remote storage. A steady high rate for this metric indicates problems with the network or remote storage endpoint. 
| `prometheus_remote_storage_shards` | Shows how many shards are currently running for each remote endpoint.
| `prometheus_remote_storage_shards_desired` | Shows the calculated needed number of shards based on the current write throughput and the rate of incoming versus sent samples.
| `prometheus_remote_storage_shards_max` | Shows the maximum number of shards based on the current configuration.
| `prometheus_remote_storage_shards_min` | Shows the minimum number of shards based on the current configuration.
| `prometheus_tsdb_wal_segment_current` | The WAL segment file that Prometheus is currently writing new data to.
| `prometheus_wal_watcher_current_segment` | The WAL segment file that each remote write instance is currently reading from.
