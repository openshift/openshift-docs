= Filtering application logs at input by including either the label expressions or matching label key and values

You can include the application logs based on the label expressions or a matching label key and its values by using the `input` selector.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {clo}.
* You have administrator permissions.
* You have created a `ClusterLogForwarder` custom resource (CR).

.Procedure

. Add a configuration for a filter to the `input` spec in the `ClusterLogForwarder` CR.
+
The following example shows how to configure the `ClusterLogForwarder` CR to include logs based on label expressions or matched label key/values:

.Example `ClusterLogForwarder` CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: ClusterLogForwarder
# ...
spec:
  inputs:
    - name: mylogs
      application:
        selector:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: env # <1>
            operator: In # <2>
            values: [“prod”, “qa”] # <3>
          - key: zone
            operator: NotIn
            values: [“east”, “west”]
          matchLabels: # <4>
            app: one
            name: app1 
# ...
----
<1> Specifies the label key to match.
<2> Specifies the operator. Valid values include: `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, and `DoesNotExist`.
<3> Specifies an array of string values. If the `operator` value is either `Exists` or `DoesNotExist`, the value array must be empty.
<4> Specifies an exact key or value mapping.

. Apply the `ClusterLogForwarder` CR by running the following command:
