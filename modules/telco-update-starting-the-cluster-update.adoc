When updating from one y-stream release to the next, you must ensure that the intermediate z-stream releases are also compatible.

[NOTE]
====
You can verify that you are updating to a viable release by running the `oc adm upgrade` command.
The `oc adm upgrade` command lists the compatible update releases.
