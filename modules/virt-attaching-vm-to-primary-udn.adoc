[id="virt-attaching-vm-to-primary-udn_{context}"]                                  
= Attaching a virtual machine to the primary user-defined network

You can connect a virtual machine (VM) to the primary user-defined network (UDN) by requesting the pod network attachment, and configuring the interface binding.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure
. Edit the `VirtualMachine` manifest to add the UDN interface details, as in the following example:
+
.Example `VirtualMachine` manifest
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: example-vm
  namespace: my-namespace # <1>
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      domain:
        devices:
          interfaces:
            - name: udn-l2-net # <2>
              binding: 
                name: l2bridge # <3>
# ...
      networks:
      - name: udn-l2-net # <4>
        pod: {}
# ...
----
<1> The namespace in which the VM is located. This value must match the namespace in which the UDN is defined.
<2> The name of the user-defined network interface.
<3> The name of the binding plugin that is used to connect the interface to the VM. The required value is `l2bridge`.
<4> The name of the network. This must match the value of the `spec.template.spec.domain.devices.interfaces.name` field.

. Apply the `VirtualMachine` manifest by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
