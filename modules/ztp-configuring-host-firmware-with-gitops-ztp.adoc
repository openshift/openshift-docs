= Managing host firmware settings with {ztp}

Hosts require the correct firmware configuration to ensure high performance and optimal efficiency.
You can deploy custom host firmware configurations for managed clusters with {ztp}.

Tune hosts with specific hardware profiles in your lab and ensure they are optimized for your requirements.
When you have completed host tuning to your satisfaction, you extract the host profile and save it in your {ztp} repository.
Then, you use the host profile to configure firmware settings in the managed cluster hosts that you deploy with {ztp}.

You specify the required hardware profiles in `SiteConfig` custom resources (CRs) that you use to deploy the managed clusters.
The {ztp} pipeline generates the required `HostFirmwareSettings` (`HFS`) and `BareMetalHost` (`BMH`) CRs that are applied to the hub cluster.

Use the following best practices to manage your host firmware profiles.

Identify critical firmware settings with hardware vendors::
Work with hardware vendors to identify and document critical host firmware settings required for optimal performance and compatibility with the deployed host platform.

Use common firmware configurations across similar hardware platforms::
Where possible, use a standardized host firmware configuration across similar hardware platforms to reduce complexity and potential errors during deployment.

Test firmware configurations in a lab environment::
Test host firmware configurations in a controlled lab environment before deploying in production to ensure that settings are compatible with hardware, firmware, and software.

Manage firmware profiles in source control::
Manage host firmware profiles in Git repositories to track changes, ensure consistency, and facilitate collaboration with vendors.
