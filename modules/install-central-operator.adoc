= Installing Central

[role="_abstract"]
The main component of {product-title} is called Central. You can install Central on {ocp} by using the `Central` custom resource. You deploy Central only once, and you can monitor multiple separate clusters by using the same Central installation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you install {product-title} for the first time, you must first install the `Central` custom resource because the `SecuredCluster` custom resource installation is dependent on certificates that Central generates.
====

.Prerequisites
* You must be using {ocp} 4.6 or later.

.Procedure
. On the {ocp} web console, navigate to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page.
. Select the {product-title} Operator from the list of installed Operators.
. By default, {ocp} lists the project as `openshift-operator`. Select *Project: openshift-operator* -> *Create project*.
+
[WARNING]
====
You must install the {product-title} `Central` custom resource in its own project and not in the default `openshift-operators` project.
====
. Enter the new project name, for example, `stackrox`, and click *Create*.
. Under the *Provided APIs* section, select *Create instance* on the *Central* API.
. Enter a name for your `Central` custom resource and add any labels you want to apply. Otherwise, accept the default values for the available options.
//Add a link for customization options
. Click *Create*.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using the cluster-wide proxy, {product-title} uses that proxy configuration to connect to the external services.
