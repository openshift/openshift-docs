[id="availability_{context}"]
= Availability

Availability and disaster avoidance are extremely important aspects of any security platform. {rh-rhacscs-first} provides numerous protections against failures at multiple levels.
To account for possible cloud provider failures, Red Hat established multiple availability zones.


[id="backup-and-disaster-recovery_{context}"]
== Backup and Disaster Recovery

All {product-title-managed-short} clusters are backed up using Database backups.
This also applies to customer data stored in the Central database.

All snapshots are created using the appropriate cloud provider snapshot APIs, encrypted and then uploaded to secure object storage, which for Amazon Web Services (AWS) is an S3 bucket.

* Red Hat does not commit to a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) or Recovery Time Objective (RTO). For more information, see link:https://www.redhat.com/licenses/Appendix_4_Red_Hat_Online_Services_20221213.pdf[PRODUCT APPENDIX 4 RED HAT ONLINE SERVICES].

* Site Reliability Engineering performs backups only as a precautionary measure. They are stored in the same region as the cluster.

* Customers should deploy multiple availability zone Secured Clusters with workloads that follow Kubernetes best practices to ensure high availability within a region.

[id="getting-support_{context}"]
