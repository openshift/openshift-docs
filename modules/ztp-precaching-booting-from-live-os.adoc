[id="ztp-booting-from-live-os_{context}"]
= Booting from a live operating system image

You can use the {factory-prestaging-tool} with to boot servers where only one disk is available and external disk drive cannot be attached to the server.

[WARNING]
====
{op-system} requires the disk to not be in use when the disk is about to be written with an {op-system} image.
====

Depending on the server hardware, you can mount the {op-system} live ISO on the blank server using one of the following methods:

* Using the Dell RACADM tool on a Dell server.
* Using the HPONCFG tool on a HP server.
* Using the Redfish BMC API.

[NOTE]
====
It is recommended to automate the mounting procedure. To automate the procedure, you need to pull the required images and host them on a local HTTP server.
====

.Prerequisites

* You powered up the host.
* You have network connectivity to the host.

.Procedure

[NOTE]
====
This example procedure uses the Redfish BMC API to mount the {op-system} live ISO.
====

. Mount the {op-system} live ISO:

.. Check virtual media status:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl --globoff -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H \
"Accept: application/json" -k -X GET --user ${username_password} \
https://$BMC_ADDRESS/redfish/v1/Managers/Self/VirtualMedia/1 | python -m json.tool
----

.. Mount the ISO file as a virtual media:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl --globoff -L -w "%{http_code} %{url_effective}\\n" -ku ${username_password} -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -d '{"Image": "http://[$HTTPd_IP]/RHCOS-live.iso"}' -X POST https://$BMC_ADDRESS/redfish/v1/Managers/Self/VirtualMedia/1/Actions/VirtualMedia.InsertMedia
----

.. Set the boot order to boot from the virtual media once:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl --globoff  -L -w "%{http_code} %{url_effective}\\n"  -ku ${username_password}  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -d '{"Boot":{ "BootSourceOverrideEnabled": "Once", "BootSourceOverrideTarget": "Cd", "BootSourceOverrideMode": "UEFI"}}' -X PATCH https://$BMC_ADDRESS/redfish/v1/Systems/Self
----

. Reboot and ensure that the server is booting from virtual media.
