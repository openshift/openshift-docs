= Identifying top risky objects by using the dashboard

Use the *Vulnerability Management* view for identifying the top risky objects in your environment.
The *Top Risky* widget displays information about the top risky images, deployments, clusters, and namespaces in your environment.
The risk is determined based on the number of vulnerabilities and their CVSS scores.

.Procedure

. Go to the {product-title-short} portal and click *Vulnerability Management* -> *Dashboard* from the navigation menu.
. Select the *Top Risky* widget header to choose between riskiest images, deployments, clusters, and namespaces.
+
The small circles on the chart represent the chosen object (image, deployment, cluster, namespace).
Hover over the circles to see an overview of the object they represent.
And select a circle to view detailed information about the selected object, its related entities, and the connections between them.
+
For example, if you are viewing *Top Risky Deployments by CVE Count and CVSS score*, each circle on the chart represents a deployment.

** When you hover over a deployment, you see an overview of the deployment, which includes deployment name, name of the cluster and namespace, severity, risk priority, CVSS, and CVE count (including fixable).
** When you select a deployment, the *Deployment* view opens for the selected deployment.
The *Deployment* view shows in-depth details of the deployment and includes information about policy violations, common vulnerabilities, CVEs, and riskiest images for that deployment.

. Select *View All* on the widget header to view all objects of the chosen type.
For example, if you chose *Top Risky Deployments by CVE Count and CVSS score*, you can select *View All* to view detailed information about all deployments in your infrastructure.
