= Configuring pods with a static IP address

The following example provisions a pod with a static IP address.

[NOTE]
====
* You can only specify the IP address for a pod's secondary network attachment for layer 2 attachments.
* Specifying a static IP address for the pod is only possible when the attachment configuration does not feature subnets.
