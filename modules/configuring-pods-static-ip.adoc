= Configuring pods with a static IP address

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure pods with a static IP address. The example in the procedure provisions a pod with a static IP address.

[NOTE]
====
* You can specify the IP address for the secondary network attachment of a pod only when the secondary network attachment, a namespaced-scoped object, uses a layer 2 or localnet topology.
* Specifying a static IP address for the pod is only possible when the attachment configuration does not feature subnets.
