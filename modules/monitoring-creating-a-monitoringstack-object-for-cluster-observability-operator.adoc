= Creating a MonitoringStack object for the {coo-full}

To scrape the metrics data exposed by the target `prometheus-coo-example-app` service, create a `MonitoringStack` object that references the `ServiceMonitor` object you created in the "Specifying how a service is monitored for {coo-full}" section.
This `MonitoringStack` object can then discover the service and scrape the exposed metrics data from it.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role or as a user with administrative permissions for the namespace.
* You have installed the {coo-full}.
* You have deployed the `prometheus-coo-example-app` sample service in the `ns1-coo` namespace.
* You have created a `ServiceMonitor` object named `prometheus-coo-example-monitor` in the `ns1-coo` namespace.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file for the `MonitoringStack` object configuration. For this example, name the file `example-coo-monitoring-stack.yaml`.

. Add the following `MonitoringStack` object configuration details:
