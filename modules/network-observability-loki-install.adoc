= Installing the Loki Operator

.Prerequisites

* Installed Loki, recommended to install Loki using the link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/openshift-logging/loki-rhel8-operator/622b46bcae289285d6fcda39[Loki Operator version 5.6], which allows the ability to specify a `network` tenant for Loki. The `network` tenant uses a specific tenant mode only implemented in version 5.6 of the Loki Operator. 
* Object storage, such as AWS S3.
* {product-title} 4.10+.
* Linux Kernel 4.18+.

//* <Any Loki install prerequisites for using with Network Observability operator?>

There are several ways you can install Loki. One way is by installing the Loki Operator using the {product-title} web console Operator Hub.


.Procedure

. Install the `Loki Operator` Operator:

.. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

.. Choose  *Loki Operator* from the list of available Operators, and click *Install*.

.. Under *Installation Mode*, select *All namespaces on the cluster*.

.. Verify that you installed the Loki Operator. Visit the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page and look for *Loki Operator*.

.. Verify that *Loki Operator* is listed with *Status* as *Succeeded* in all the projects.
+
. Create a `Secret` YAML file. You can create this secret in the web console or CLI. 

.. Using the web console, navigate to the Import icon ,*+*, in the top right corner. Drop your YAML file into the editor. It is important to create this YAML file in the `netobserv` namespace that uses the `access_key_id` and `access_key_secret` to specify your credentials. 

.. Once you create the secret, you should see it listed under *Workloads* -> *Secrets* in the web console.

The following shows an example secret YAML file:
