= Installing the {loki-op}

[role="_abstract"]
Install the supported {loki-op} version from the software catalog to enable the secure `LokiStack` instance, which provides automatic in-cluster authentication and authorization for network observability.

The link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/openshift-logging/loki-rhel9-operator/64479927e1820602a81cdf13[{loki-op} versions 6.0+] are the supported {loki-op} versions for network observability; these versions provide the ability to create a `LokiStack` instance using the `openshift-network` tenant configuration mode and provide fully-automatic, in-cluster authentication and authorization support for network observability.
