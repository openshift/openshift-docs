= About the virtual machine storage migration process

During the migration, a `MigMigration` resource is created indicating what type of migration is happening. 

The types of migration are as follows:

* Stage: Stage migration copies data from the source cluster to the target cluster without stopping the application. You can run a stage migration multiple times to reduce the duration of the cutover migration.
* Rollback:  Rolls back a completed migration.
* Cutover: Cutover migration stops the transactions on the source cluster and moves the resources to the target cluster.

The status of the `MigMigration` resource contains progress information about any live storage migrations.

Any offline migrations contain the `DirectVolumeMigrationProgress` status that shows the progress of the offline migration.

Each `MigMigration` creates a `DirectVolumeMigration` if the migration plan is a direct volume migration plan. 

To perform a storage live migration, a direct volume migration is required.
