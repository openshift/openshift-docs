= About the virtual machine storage migration process

{mtc-first} uses a `MigMigration` resource to manage the migration process. This resource tracks the progress and type of migration being performed.

* Stage: This migration copies data from the source cluster to the target cluster without stopping the application. You can run this multiple times to reduce the final cutover duration.

* Rollback: This action reverts a completed migration.

* Cutover: This migration stops the application on the source cluster and moves resources to the target. It is important to note that live migration only occurs during the cutover phase.

To perform a storage live migration, a direct volume migration is required. This is a significantly faster process than copying data to a replication repository and then to the target cluster.

The status of the `MigMigration` resource contains progress information about any live storage migrations.

Any offline migrations contain the `DirectVolumeMigrationProgress` status that shows the progress of the offline migration.

Each `MigMigration` creates a `DirectVolumeMigration` if the migration plan is a direct volume migration plan.

To perform a storage live migration, a direct volume migration is required.
