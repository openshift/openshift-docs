= Troubleshooting {microshift-short} updates

In some cases, {microshift-short} might fail to update. In these events, it is helpful to understand failure types and how to troubleshoot them.

[id="microshift-update-path-blocked-by-version-sequence_{context}"]
== Update path is blocked by {microshift-short} version sequence
{microshift-short} requires serial updates. Attempting to update {microshift-short} by skipping a minor version fails:

* For example, if your current version is `4.14.5`, but you try to update from that version to `4.16.0`, the message, `executable (4.16.0) is too recent compared to existing data (4.14.5): version difference is 2, maximum allowed difference is 1` appears and {microshift-short} fails to start.

In this example, you must first update `4.14.5` to a version of `4.15`, and then you can upgrade to `4.16.0`.

[id="microshift-update-path-blocked-by-version-incompatibility_{context}"]
== Update path is blocked by version incompatibility
RPM dependency errors result if a {microshift-short} update is incompatible with the version of {op-system-ostree-first} or {op-system-base-full}.

Check the following compatibility table:

include::snippets/microshift-rhde-compatibility-table-snip.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

Check the following update paths:

*{product-title} update paths*

* Generally Available Version 4.14.0 to 4.14.z on {op-system-ostree} 9.2
* Generally Available Version 4.14.0 to 4.14.z on {op-system} 9.2

[id="microshift-ostree-update-failed_{context}"]
== OSTree update failed
If you updated on an OSTree system, the Greenboot health check automatically logs and acts on system health. A failure can be indicated by a system rollback by Greenboot. In cases where the update failed, but Greenboot did not complete a system rollback, you can troubleshoot using the {op-system-ostree} documentation linked in the "Additional resources" section that follows this content.

Checking the Greenboot logs manually::
* Manually check the Greenboot logs to verify system health by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo systemctl restart --no-block greenboot-healthcheck && sudo journalctl -fu greenboot-healthcheck
----

[id="microshift-rpm-update-failed_{context}"]
== Manual RPM update failed
If you updated by using RPMs on a non-OSTree system, an update failure can be indicated by Greenboot, but the health checks are only informative. Checking the system logs is the next step in troubleshooting a manual RPM update failure. You can use Greenboot and `sos report` to check both the {microshift-short} update and the host system.
