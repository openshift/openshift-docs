= About monitoring stack components

The {product-title} monitoring stack is based on the link:https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] open source project and its wider ecosystem. The monitoring stack includes the following:

* *Default platform monitoring components*. A set of platform monitoring components are installed in the `openshift-monitoring` project by default during an {product-title} installation. This provides monitoring for core {product-title} components including Kubernetes services. The default monitoring stack also enables remote health monitoring for clusters. These components are illustrated in the *Installed by default* section in the following diagram.

* *Components for monitoring user-defined projects*. After optionally enabling monitoring for user-defined projects, additional monitoring components are installed in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project. This provides monitoring for user-defined projects. These components are illustrated in the *User* section in the following diagram.
