= Understanding device plug-ins

The device plug-in provides a consistent and portable solution to consume hardware
devices across clusters. The device plug-in provides support for these devices
through an extension mechanism, which makes these devices available to
Containers, provides health checks of these devices, and securely shares them.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} supports the device plug-in API, but the device plug-in
Containers are supported by individual vendors.
====

A device plug-in is a gRPC service running on the nodes (external to
the `kubelet`) that is responsible for managing specific
hardware resources. Any device plug-in must support following remote procedure
calls (RPCs):

[source,golang]
----
service DevicePlugin {
      // GetDevicePluginOptions returns options to be communicated with Device
      // Manager
      rpc GetDevicePluginOptions(Empty) returns (DevicePluginOptions) {}

      // ListAndWatch returns a stream of List of Devices
      // Whenever a Device state change or a Device disappears, ListAndWatch
      // returns the new list
      rpc ListAndWatch(Empty) returns (stream ListAndWatchResponse) {}

      // Allocate is called during container creation so that the Device
      // Plug-in can run device specific operations and instruct Kubelet
      // of the steps to make the Device available in the container
      rpc Allocate(AllocateRequest) returns (AllocateResponse) {}

      // PreStartcontainer is called, if indicated by Device Plug-in during
      // registration phase, before each container start. Device plug-in
      // can run device specific operations such as reseting the device
      // before making devices available to the container
      rpc PreStartcontainer(PreStartcontainerRequest) returns (PreStartcontainerResponse) {}
}

[NOTE]
====
For easy device plug-in reference implementation, there is a stub device plug-in
in the Device Manager code:
*_vendor/k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/kubelet/cm/deviceplugin/device_plugin_stub.go_*.
====

== Methods for deploying a device plug-in

* Daemon sets are the recommended approach for device plug-in deployments.
* Upon start, the device plug-in will try to create a UNIX domain socket at
*_/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugin/_* on the node to serve RPCs from Device Manager.
* Since device plug-ins must manage hardware resources, access to the host
file system, as well as socket creation, they must be run in a privileged
security context.
* More specific details regarding deployment steps can be found with each device
plug-in implementation.
