= Support for Windows CSI drivers

{productwinc} installs link:https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-proxy[CSI Proxy] on all Windows nodes in the cluster. CSI Proxy is a plug-in that enables CSI drivers to perform storage operations on the node. 

To use persistent storage with Windows workloads, you must deploy a specific Windows CSI driver daemon set, as described in your storage provider's documentation. By default, the WMCO does not automatically create the Windows CSI driver daemon set. See the list of link:https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/drivers.html#production-drivers[production drivers] in the Kubernetes CSI Developer Documentation.

[NOTE]
====
Red{nbsp}Hat does not provide support for the third-party production drivers listed in the Kubernetes CSI Developer Documentation.
