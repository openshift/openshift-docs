= Configuring graceful node shutdown

To configure graceful node shutdown, create a `KubeletConfig` custom resource (CR) to specify a shutdown grace period for pods on a set of nodes. The graceful node shutdown feature minimizes interruption to workloads that run on these pods.

[NOTE]
====
If you do not configure graceful node shutdown, the default grace period is `0` and the pod is forcefully evicted from the node.
====

.Prerequisites

ifndef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* You are logged in to {product-title} as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
ifdef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* You are logged in to {product-title} as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* You have defined priority classes for pods that require critical or regular classification.

.Procedure

. Define shutdown grace periods in the `KubeletConfig` CR by saving the following YAML in the `kubelet-gns.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: KubeletConfig
metadata:
  name: graceful-shutdown
  namespace: openshift-machine-config-operator
spec:
  machineConfigPoolSelector:
    matchLabels:
      pools.operator.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/worker: "" <1>
  kubeletConfig:
    shutdownGracePeriod: "3m" <2>
    shutdownGracePeriodCriticalPods: "2m" <3>
#...
----
<1> This example applies shutdown grace periods to nodes with the `worker` role.
<2> Define a time period for regular pods to shut down.
<3> Define a time period for critical pods to shut down.

. Create the `KubeletConfig` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f kubelet-gns.yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
kubeletconfig.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/graceful-shutdown created
----

.Verification

. View the kubelet logs for a node to verify the grace period configuration by using the command line or by viewing the `kubelet.conf` file.
+
[NOTE]
====
Ensure that the log messages for `shutdownGracePeriodRequested` and `shutdownGracePeriodCriticalPods` match the values set in the `KubeletConfig` CR.
====

.. To view the logs by using the command line, run the following command, replacing `<node_name>` with the name of the node:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc adm node-logs <node_name> -u kubelet
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]

$ chroot /host

. During a graceful node shutdown, you can verify that a pod was gracefully shut down by running the following command, replacing `<pod_name>` with the name of the pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe pod <pod_name>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Reason:         Terminated
Message:        Pod was terminated in response to imminent node shutdown.
