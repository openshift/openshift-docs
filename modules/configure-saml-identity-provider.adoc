= Configuring a SAML 2.0 identity provider

Use the instructions in this section to integrate a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 identity provider with {rh-rhacscs-first}.

.Prerequisites
* You must have permissions to configure identity providers in {product-title-short}.
* For Okta identity providers, you must have an Okta app configured for {product-title-short}.

.Procedure
. On the {product-title-short} portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Access Control*.
. Click *Create auth provider* and select *SAML 2.0* from the drop-down list.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name to identify this authentication provider; for example, *Okta* or *Google*. The integration name is shown on the login page to help users select the correct sign-in option.
. In the *ServiceProvider issuer* field, enter the value that you are using as the `Audience URI` or `SP Entity ID` in Okta, or a similar value in other providers.
. Select the type of *Configuration*:
** *Option 1: Dynamic Configuration*: If you select this option, enter the *IdP Metadata URL*, or the URL of *Identity Provider metadata* available from your identity provider console. The configuration values are acquired from the URL.
** *Option 2: Static Configuration*: Copy the required static fields from the *View Setup Instructions* link in the Okta console, or a similar location for other providers:
*** *IdP Issuer*
*** *IdP SSO URL*
*** *Name/ID Format*
*** *IdP Certificate(s) (PEM)*

. Assign a *Minimum access role* for users who access {product-title-short} using SAML.

[TIP]
====
Set the *Minimum access role* to *Admin* while you complete setup. Later, you can return to the *Access Control* page to set up more tailored access rules based on user metadata from your identity provider.
====
. Click *Save*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If your SAML identity provider's authentication response meets the following criteria:

* Includes a `NotValidAfter` assertion: The user session remains valid until the time specified in the `NotValidAfter` field has elapsed. After the user session expires, users must reauthenticate.
* Does not include a `NotValidAfter` assertion: The user session remains valid for 30 days, and then users must reauthenticate.
====

.Verification

. On the {product-title-short} portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Access Control*.
. Select the *Auth Providers* tab.
. Click the authentication provider for which you want to verify the configuration.
. Select *Test login* from the *Auth Provider* section header.
The *Test login* page opens in a new browser tab.
. Sign in with your credentials.
** If you logged in successfully, {product-title-short} shows the `User ID` and `User Attributes` that the identity provider sent for the credentials that you used to log in to the system.
** If your login attempt failed, {product-title-short} shows a message describing why the identity provider's response could not be processed.
. Close the *Test login* browser tab.

[NOTE]
====
Even if the response indicates successful authentication, you might need to create additional access rules based on the user metadata from your identity provider.
