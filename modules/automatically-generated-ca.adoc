= Retrieving the automatically generated certificate authority

When installing {product-title-short}, a certificate authority (CA) is automatically generated and stored in a Kubernetes secret on the cluster. If you later change your installation by using Helm, you might need to supply this CA. For example, enabling Scanner V4 requires that you provide this CA.

The automatically generated CA is stored in a secret that is usually named similar to `stackrox-generated-_suffix_`, where _suffix_ is a randomly generated string.

To retrieve the CA and export it to a `generated-values.yaml` file when needed for the `helm upgrade` command, for example, run the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ kubectl -n <namespace> get secret stackrox-generated-<suffix> \
  -o go-template='{{ index .data "generated-values.yaml" }}' | \
  base64 --decode >generated-values.yaml
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
This file might contain sensitive data, so store it in a safe place.

If you are using the `helm upgrade` command after changing a configuration, you might need to supply this CA. For example, to update your system and enable Scanner V4, you run the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ helm upgrade -n stackrox stackrox-central-services rhacs/central-services --reuse-values \
  -f <path_to_generated-values.yaml> \
  --set scannerV4.disable=false
