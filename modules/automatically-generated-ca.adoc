= Retrieving the automatically generated certificate authority

When installing {product-title-short}, a certificate authority (CA) is automatically generated and stored in a Kubernetes secret on the cluster. If you later change your installation by using Helm, you might need to supply this CA. For example, enabling an {product-title-short} component that was initially disabled at installation time requires that you provide this CA.

The automatically generated CA is stored in a secret that is usually named similar to `stackrox-generated-_suffix_`, where _suffix_ is a randomly generated string.

To retrieve the CA and export it to a `generated-values.yaml` file when needed for the `helm upgrade` command, for example, run the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ kubectl -n <namespace> get secret stackrox-generated-<suffix> \
  -o go-template='{{ index .data "generated-values.yaml" }}' | \
  base64 --decode >generated-values.yaml
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
This file might contain sensitive data, so store it in a safe place.

If you are using the `helm upgrade` command after changing a configuration, you might need to supply this CA. For example, to update your system and enable Scanner V4, you run the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ helm upgrade -n stackrox stackrox-central-services rhacs/central-services --reuse-values \
  -f <path_to_generated-values.yaml> \
  --set scannerV4.disable=false
