= About an egress router pod

The {product-title} egress router pod redirects traffic to a specified remote server from a private source IP address that is not used for any other purpose. An egress router pod can send network traffic to servers that are set up to allow access only from specific IP addresses.

[NOTE]
====
The egress router pod is not intended for every outgoing connection. Creating large numbers of egress router pods can exceed the limits of your network hardware. For example, creating an egress router pod for every project or application could exceed the number of local MAC addresses that the network interface can handle before reverting to filtering MAC addresses in software.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The egress router image is not compatible with Amazon AWS, Azure Cloud, or any other cloud platform that does not support layer 2 manipulations due to their incompatibility with macvlan traffic.

== Egress router modes

In _redirect mode_, an egress router pod configures `iptables` rules to redirect traffic from its own IP address to one or more destination IP addresses. Client pods that need to use the reserved source IP address must be configured to access the service for the egress router rather than connecting directly to the destination IP. You can access the destination service and port from the application pod by using the `curl` command. For example:

[source,terminal]
----
$ curl <router_service_IP> <port>
----

ifdef::openshift-sdn[]
In _HTTP proxy mode_, an egress router pod runs as an HTTP proxy on port `8080`. This mode only works for clients that are connecting to HTTP-based or HTTPS-based services, but usually requires fewer changes to the client pods to get them to work. Many programs can be told to use an HTTP proxy by setting an environment variable.

In _DNS proxy mode_, an egress router pod runs as a DNS proxy for TCP-based services from its own IP address to one or more destination IP addresses. To make use of the reserved, source IP address, client pods must be modified to connect to the egress router pod rather than connecting directly to the destination IP address. This modification ensures that external destinations treat traffic as though it were coming from a known source.

Redirect mode works for all services except for HTTP and HTTPS. For HTTP and HTTPS services, use HTTP proxy mode. For TCP-based services with IP addresses or domain names, use DNS proxy mode.

ifdef::ovn[]
[NOTE]
====
The egress router CNI plugin supports redirect mode only. This is a difference with the egress router implementation that you can deploy with OpenShift SDN. Unlike the egress router for OpenShift SDN, the egress router CNI plugin does not support HTTP proxy mode or DNS proxy mode.

== Egress router pod implementation

ifdef::openshift-sdn[]
The egress router pod setup is performed by an initialization container. That container runs in a privileged context so that it can configure the macvlan interface and set up `iptables` rules. After the initialization container finishes setting up the `iptables` rules, it exits. Next the egress router pod executes the container to handle the egress router traffic. The image used varies depending on the egress router mode.

The environment variables determine which addresses the egress-router image uses. The image configures the macvlan interface to use `EGRESS_SOURCE` as its IP address, with `EGRESS_GATEWAY` as the IP address for the gateway.

Network Address Translation (NAT) rules are set up so that connections to the cluster IP address of the pod on any TCP or UDP port are redirected to the same port on IP address specified by the `EGRESS_DESTINATION` variable.

If only some of the nodes in your cluster are capable of claiming the specified source IP address and using the specified gateway, you can specify a `nodeName` or `nodeSelector` to identify which nodes are acceptable.
endif::openshift-sdn[]

ifdef::ovn[]
The egress router implementation uses the egress router Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin. The plugin adds a secondary network interface to a pod.

An egress router is a pod that has two network interfaces. For example, the pod can have `eth0` and `net1` network interfaces. The `eth0` interface is on the cluster network and the pod continues to use the interface for ordinary cluster-related network traffic. The `net1` interface is on a secondary network and has an IP address and gateway for that network. Other pods in the {product-title} cluster can access the egress router service and the service enables the pods to access external services. The egress router acts as a bridge between pods and an external system.

Traffic that leaves the egress router exits through a node, but the packets
have the MAC address of the `net1` interface from the egress router pod.

When you add an egress router custom resource, the Cluster Network Operator creates the following objects:

* The network attachment definition for the `net1` secondary network interface of the pod.

* A deployment for the egress router.

If you delete an egress router custom resource, the Operator deletes the two objects in the preceding list that are associated with the egress router.

[id="nw-egress-router-about-deployments_{context}"]
== Deployment considerations

An egress router pod adds an additional IP address and MAC address to the primary network interface of the node. As a result, you might need to configure your hypervisor or cloud provider to allow the additional address.

{rh-openstack-first}::

If you deploy {product-title} on {rh-openstack}, you must allow traffic from the IP and MAC addresses of the egress router pod on your OpenStack environment. If you do not allow the traffic, then link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2803331[communication will fail]:

[source,terminal]
----
$ openstack port set --allowed-address \
  ip_address=<ip_address>,mac_address=<mac_address> <neutron_port_uuid>

== Failover configuration

ifdef::openshift-sdn[]
To avoid downtime, you can deploy an egress router pod with a `Deployment` resource, as in the following example. To create a new `Service` object for the example deployment, use the `oc expose deployment/egress-demo-controller` command.

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: egress-demo-controller
spec:
  replicas: 1 <1>
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: egress-router
  template:
    metadata:
      name: egress-router
      labels:
        name: egress-router
      annotations:
        pod.network.openshift.io/assign-macvlan: "true"
    spec: <2>
      initContainers:
        ...
      containers:
        ...
----
<1> Ensure that replicas is set to `1`, because only one pod can use a given egress source IP address at any time. This means that only a single copy of the router runs on a node.

<2> Specify the `Pod` object template for the egress router pod.
endif::openshift-sdn[]

ifdef::ovn[]
To avoid downtime, the Cluster Network Operator deploys the egress router pod as a deployment resource. The deployment name is `egress-router-cni-deployment`. The pod that corresponds to the deployment has a label of `app=egress-router-cni`.

To create a new service for the deployment, use the `oc expose deployment/egress-router-cni-deployment --port <port_number>` command or create a file like the following example:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: app-egress
spec:
  ports:
  - name: tcp-8080
    protocol: TCP
    port: 8080
  - name: tcp-8443
    protocol: TCP
    port: 8443
  - name: udp-80
    protocol: UDP
    port: 80
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: egress-router-cni
