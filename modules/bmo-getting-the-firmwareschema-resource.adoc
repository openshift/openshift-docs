= Getting the FirmwareSchema resource

Each host model from each vendor has different BIOS settings. When editing the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource's `spec` section, the name/value pairs you set must conform to that host's firmware schema. To ensure you are setting valid name/value pairs, get the `FirmwareSchema` for the host and review it.

.Procedure

. Get the list of `FirmwareSchema` resource instances by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get firmwareschema -n openshift-machine-api
----

. Get a particular `FirmwareSchema` instance by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get firmwareschema <instance_name> -n openshift-machine-api -o yaml
----
+
Where `<instance_name>` is the name of the schema instance stated in the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource (see Table 3).
