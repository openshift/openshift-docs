= Argo CD Agent Autonomous mode

In autonomous mode, Argo CD Applications resources are defined locally on workload clusters and synchronized back to control plane clusters for observability.

In autonomous mode, changes made on workload clusters appear on the control plane. Also, the control plane cannot modify applications directly. With this mode, the workload cluster is the source of truth for Argo CD application state.

The following list describes the direction of synchronization between the workload and control plane clusters:

* `.spec` - from workload cluster to control plane  
* `.status` - from workload cluster to control plane

The following list highlights the key advantages of using this configuration:

* Ensures that Argo CD Application definitions are stored authoritatively in Git to deliver a key {gitops-shortname} advantage. Git serves as the single source of truth, while you also gain the benefit of centralized observability.
* Removes the control plane as a single point of failure or compromise.
* Supports complex deployment patterns such as app-of-apps.

Consider the following limitations when using this configuration:

* Prevents modification of applications from the control plane interface.
* Requires external management of application definitions in Git repositories.
