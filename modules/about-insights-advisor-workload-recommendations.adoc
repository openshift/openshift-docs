= About Insights advisor service recommendations for workloads

You can use the Red Hat Insights for OpenShift advisor service to view and manage information about recommendations that affect not only your clusters, but also your workloads. The advisor service takes advantage of deployment validation and helps OpenShift cluster administrators to see all runtime violations of deployment policies. You can see recommendations for workloads at link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/insights/advisor/workloads[OpenShift > Advisor > Workloads] on the {hybrid-console}.
