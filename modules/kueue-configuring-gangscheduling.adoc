= Configuring gang scheduling

As a cluster administrator, you can configure gang scheduling by modifying the `gangScheduling` spec in the `Kueue` custom resource (CR).

----
<1> You can set the `policy` value to enable or disable gang scheduling. The possible values are `ByWorkload`, `None`, or empty (`""`).
+
`ByWorkload`:: When the `policy` value is set to `ByWorkload`, each job is processed and considered for admission as a single unit. If the job does not become ready within the specified time, the entire job is evicted and retried at a later time.
+
`None`:: When the `policy` value is set to `None`, gang scheduling is disabled.
+
Empty (`""`):: When the `policy` value is empty or set to `""`, the {kueue-name} Operator determines settings for gang scheduling. Currently, gang scheduling is disabled by default.
<2> If the `policy` value is set to `ByWorkload`, you must configure job admission settings. The possible values for the `admission` spec are `Parallel`, `Sequential`, or empty (`""`).
+
`Parallel`:: When the `admission` value is set to `Parallel`, pods from any job can be admitted at any time. This can cause a deadlock, where jobs are in contention for cluster capacity. When a deadlock occurs, the successful scheduling of pods from another job can prevent the scheduling of pods from the current job.
+
`Sequential`:: When the `admission` value is set to `Sequential`, only pods from the currently processing job are admitted. After all of the pods from the current job have been admitted and are ready, {kueue-name} processes the next job. Sequential processing can slow down admission when the cluster has sufficient capacity for multiple jobs, but provides a higher likelihood that all of the pods for a job are scheduled together successfully.
+
Empty (`""`):: When the `admission` value is empty or set to `""`, the {kueue-name} Operator determines job admission settings. Currently, the `admission` value is set to `Parallel` by default.
