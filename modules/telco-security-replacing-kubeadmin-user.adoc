[id="telco-security-replacing-kubeadmin-user_{context}"]
= Replacing the kubeadmin user with a cluster-admin user

The `kubeadmin` user with the `cluster-admin` privileges is created on every cluster by default. To enhance the cluster security, you can replace the`kubeadmin` user with a `cluster-admin` user and then disable or remove the `kubeadmin` user.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have administrative access to a virtual vault for secure storage.

.Procedure

. Create an emergency `cluster-admin` user by using the `htpasswd` identity provider. For more information, see "About htpasswd authentication".

. Assign the `cluster-admin` privileges to the new user by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin <emergency_user>
----

. Verify the emergency user access:

.. Log in to the cluster using the new emergency user.
.. Confirm that the user has `cluster-admin` privileges by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc whoami
----
+
Ensure the output shows the emergency user's ID.

. Store the password or authentication key for the emergency user securely in a virtual vault. 
+
[NOTE]
====
Follow the best practices of your organization for securing sensitive credentials.
====

. Disable or remove the `kubeadmin` user to reduce security risks by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete secrets kubeadmin -n kube-system
----
