= Sample customized `install-config.yaml` file for GCP

You can customize the `install-config.yaml` file to specify more details about your {product-title} cluster's platform or modify the values of the required parameters.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This sample YAML file is provided for reference only. You must obtain your `install-config.yaml` file by using the installation program and modify it.

<1> Specify the public DNS on the host project.
<2> If you do not provide these parameters and values, the installation program provides the default value.
<3> The `controlPlane` section is a single mapping, but the compute section is a sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures, the first line of the `compute` section must begin with a hyphen, `-`, and the first line of the `controlPlane` section must not. Although both sections currently define a single machine pool, it is possible that future versions of {product-title} will support defining multiple compute pools during installation. Only one control plane pool is used.
<4> Whether to enable or disable simultaneous multithreading, or `hyperthreading`. By default, simultaneous multithreading is enabled to increase the performance of your machines' cores. You can disable it by setting the parameter value to `Disabled`. If you disable simultaneous multithreading in some cluster machines, you must disable it in all cluster machines.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you disable simultaneous multithreading, ensure that your capacity planning accounts for the dramatically decreased machine performance. Use larger machine types, such as `n1-standard-8`, for your machines if you disable simultaneous multithreading.
====
<5> Optional: A set of network tags to apply to the control plane or compute machine sets. The `platform.gcp.defaultMachinePlatform.tags` parameter applies to both control plane and compute machines. If the `compute.platform.gcp.tags` or `controlPlane.platform.gcp.tags` parameters are set, they override the `platform.gcp.defaultMachinePlatform.tags` parameter.
<6> The cluster network plugin to install. The supported values are `OVNKubernetes` and `OpenShiftSDN`. The default value is `OVNKubernetes`.
<7> Specify the main project where the VM instances reside.
<8> Specify the region that your VPC network is in.
ifndef::openshift-origin[]
<9> Whether to enable or disable FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the {op-system-first} machines that {product-title} runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with {op-system} instead.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To enable FIPS mode for your cluster, you must run the installation program from a {op-system-base-full} computer configured to operate in FIPS mode. For more information about configuring FIPS mode on RHEL, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/security_hardening/assembly_installing-the-system-in-fips-mode_security-hardening[Installing the system in FIPS mode]. When running {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.
====
<10> You can optionally provide the `sshKey` value that you use to access the machines in your cluster.

[NOTE]
====
For production {product-title} clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your `ssh-agent` process uses.

<11> How to publish the user-facing endpoints of your cluster. Set `publish` to `Internal` to deploy a private cluster, which cannot be accessed from the internet. The default value is `External`.
To use a shared VPC in a cluster that uses infrastructure that you provision, you must set `publish` to `Internal`. The installation program will no longer be able to access the public DNS zone for the base domain in the host project.
