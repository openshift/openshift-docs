= Example: DNS use case

For this example, a front-end application is running in one set of pods and a back-end service is running in another set of pods. The front-end application needs to communicate with the back-end service. You create a service for the back-end pods that gives it a stable IP address and DNS name. The front-end pods use this DNS name to access the back-end service regardless of changes to individual pod IP addresses.

By creating a service for the back-end pods, you provide a stable IP and DNS name, `backend-service.default.svc.cluster.local`, that the front-end pods can use to communicate with the back-end service. This setup would ensure that even if individual pod IP addresses change, the communication remains consistent and reliable. 

The following steps demonstrate an example of how to configure front-end pods to communicate with a back-end service using DNS.

. Create the back-end service. 

.. Deploy the back-end pods.
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: backend-deployment
  labels:
    app: backend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: backend
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: backend-container
          image: your-backend-image
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
----

.. Define a service to expose the back-end pods.
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: backend-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: backend
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
----

. Create the front-end pods.

.. Define the front-end pods.
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: frontend-deployment
  labels:
    app: frontend
  spec:
    replicas: 3
    selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
   template:
   metadata:
     labels:
       app: frontend
   spec:
     containers:
       - name: frontend-container
         image: your-frontend-image
         ports:
           - containerPort: 80
----

.. Apply the pod definition to your cluster.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f frontend-deployment.yaml
----

. Configure the front-end to communicate with the back-end. 
+
In your front-end application code, use the DNS name of the back-end service to send requests. For example, if your front-end application needs to fetch data from the back-end pod, your application might include the following code:
+
[source, JavaScript]
----
fetch('http://backend-service.default.svc.cluster.local/api/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
