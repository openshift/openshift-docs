= Upgrading the OpenShift sandboxed containers operator

The operator itself can be upgraded via the OpenShift Lifecycle Manager (OLM) either manually or automatically. You can select manual or automatic during the initial deployment. In case of manual upgrades the web console shows available updates which can be installed by the cluster administrator.
