= AWS DynamoDB Streams with IntegrationSource

The Amazon Web Services (AWS) DynamoDB Streams Kamelet allows you to consume changes from an Amazon DynamoDB table and forward them into Knative Eventing. This integration makes it easier to react to database changes and propagate events within your serverless applications.

To configure an `IntegrationSource` for DynamoDB Streams, you must provide valid AWS credentials, specify the DynamoDB table and its region, and define the event sink, such as a Knative broker.
