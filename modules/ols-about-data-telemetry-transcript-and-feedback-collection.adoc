{ols-long} processes natural-language messages and cluster metadata through a redaction layer before transmitting the data to your configured LLM provider.

Do not enter any information into the {ols-long} user interface that you do not want sent to the LLM provider.

The transcript recording data uses the {red-hat} Insights system back-end and is subject to the same access restrictions and other security policies described in link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/insights/data-application-security[Red Hat Insights data and application security].
