= Automatically injecting sidecars

To enable this feature, add the `sidecar.jaegertracing.io/inject` annotation to either the string `true` or to the {JaegerShortName} instance name that is returned by running `$ oc get jaegers`.
When you specify `true`, there should be only a single {JaegerShortName} instance for the same namespace as the deployment, otherwise, the Operator cannot determine which {JaegerShortName} instance to use. A specific {JaegerShortName} instance name on a deployment has a higher precedence than `true` applied on its namespace.

The following snippet shows a simple application that will inject a sidecar, with the agent pointing to the single {JaegerShortName} instance available in the same namespace:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
  annotations:
    "sidecar.jaegertracing.io/inject": "true" # <1>

<i> Set to either the string `true` or to the Jaeger instance name.

When the sidecar is injected, the agent can then be accessed at its default location on `localhost`.
