= Image stream change triggers

[role="_abstract"]
To automate your application lifecycle and ensure they use the latest code, configure image stream triggers in {product-title}. Image stream triggers allow your builds and deployments to be automatically invoked when a new version of an upstream image is available.

//from FAQ

For example, builds and deployments can be automatically started when an image
stream tag is modified. This is achieved by monitoring that particular image
stream tag and notifying the build or deployment when a change is detected.
