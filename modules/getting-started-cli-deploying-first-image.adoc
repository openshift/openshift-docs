The simplest way to deploy an application in {product-title} is to run an existing container image. The following procedure deploys a front-end component of an application called `national-parks-app`. The web application displays an interactive map. The map displays the location of major national parks across the world.

.Prerequisites

* You must have access to an {product-title} cluster.
* You must have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

* To deploy an application, enter the following command:

$ oc new-app quay.io/openshiftroadshow/parksmap:latest --name=parksmap -l 'app=national-parks-app,component=parksmap,role=frontend,app.kubernetes.io/part-of=national-parks-app'
