.Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} cluster.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

* Deploy the `parksmap` application by running the following command:

$ oc new-app quay.io/openshiftroadshow/parksmap:latest --name=parksmap -l 'app=national-parks-app,component=parksmap,role=frontend,app.kubernetes.io/part-of=national-parks-app'
----
+
