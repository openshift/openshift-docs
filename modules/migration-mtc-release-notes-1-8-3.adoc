== Resolved issues

This release has the following major resolved issues:

.CVE-2024-24786: Flaw in Golang `protobuf` module causes `unmarshal` function to enter infinite loop

In previous releases of {mtc-short}, a vulnerability was found in Golang's `protobuf` module, where the `unmarshal` function entered an infinite loop while processing certain invalid inputs. Consequently, an attacker provided carefully constructed invalid inputs, which caused the function to enter an infinite loop.

With this update, the `unmarshal` function works as expected.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-24786[CVE-2024-24786].

.CVE-2023-45857: Axios Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability

In previous releases of {mtc-short}, a vulnerability was discovered in Axios 1.5.1 that inadvertently revealed a confidential `XSRF-TOKEN` stored in cookies by including it in the HTTP header `X-XSRF-TOKEN` for every request made to the host, allowing attackers to view sensitive information.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-45857[CVE-2023-45857].

.Restic backup does not work properly when the source workload is not quiesced

In previous releases of {mtc-short}, some files did not migrate when deploying an application with a route. The Restic backup did not function as expected when the quiesce option was unchecked for the source workload.

This issue has been resolved in {mtc-short} 1.8.3.

For more information, see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2242064[BZ#2242064].

.The `Migration Controller` fails to install due to an unsupported value error in Velero
