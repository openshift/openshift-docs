[id="known-issues-1-8-3_{context}"]
== Known issues

{mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) has the following known issues:

.Not currently possible to migrate associated scc for service account in {ocp-name} 4.12

It is not possible to migrate associated security context constraints (SCCs) for service account in {OCP} ({ocp-name}) version 4.12. This issue is planned to be resolved in {mtc-short} 1.8.4. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MIG-1454(MIG-1454).

.Vulnerability exposes confidential data stored in cookies

A flaw was found in Axios 1.5.1 that exposes a confidential session token. This flaw allows a remote hacker to bypass security measures and view sensitive data.

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-45857[CVE-2023-45857].

.Flaw in Golang `protobuf` module causes `unmarshal` function to enter infinite loop

A flaw was found in Golang's `protobuf` module, where the `unmarshal` function can enter an infinite loop when processing certain invalid inputs. This issue occurs during the following situations:

* Unmarshaling into a message that includes a `google.protobuf.Any` 
* When the `UnmarshalOptions.DiscardUnknown` option is enabled. 

This flaw allows an attacker to craft malicious input tailored to trigger the identified flaw in the `unmarshal` function. By providing carefully constructed invalid inputs, they could potentially cause the function to enter an infinite loop, resulting in a denial of service condition or other unintended behaviors in the affected system. 

For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-24786[CVE-2024-24786].
