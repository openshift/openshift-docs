* To view events in your project from the {product-title} console.
+
. Launch the {product-title} console.
+
. Click *Home* -> *Events* and select your project.

. Move to resource that you want to see events. For example: *Home* -> *Projects* -> <project-name> -> <resource-name>.
+
Many objects, such as pods and deployments, have their own
*Events* tab as well, which shows events related to that object.
