= Enabling the SR-IOV Network Operator in a hosted cluster

You can enable the SR-IOV Network Operator to manage SR-IOV-capable devices on nodes deployed by the `NodePool` resource. The operator runs in the hosted cluster and requires labeled worker nodes.

.Procedure

. Generate a `kubeconfig` file for the hosted cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ hcp create kubeconfig --name $CLUSTER_NAME > $CLUSTER_NAME-kubeconfig
----

. Create a `kubeconfig` resource environment variable by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export KUBECONFIG=$CLUSTER_NAME-kubeconfig
----

. Label each worker node to indicate SR-IOV capability by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node <worker_node_name> feature.node.kubernetes.io/network-sriov.capable=true
----
+
--
where:

`<worker_node_name>`:: Specifies the name of a worker node in the hosted cluster.
--

. Install the SR-IOV Network Operator in the hosted cluster by following the instructions in "Installing the SR-IOV Network Operator".

. After installation, configure SR-IOV workloads in the hosted cluster by using the same process as for a standalone cluster.
