= Limitations of load balancer services

[role="_abstract"]
To optimise network resource management and mitigate operational risks in {product-title} clusters on {rh-openstack-first}, review the implementation of Octavia for load balancer services. 

{product-title} clusters on {rh-openstack-first} use Octavia to handle load balancer services. As a result, your cluster has several functional limitations.

{rh-openstack} Octavia has two supported providers: Amphora and OVN. These providers differ in available features and implementation details. These distinctions affect load balancer services that you create on your cluster.
