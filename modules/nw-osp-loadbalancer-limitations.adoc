= Limitations of load balancer services

{product-title} clusters on {rh-openstack-first} use Octavia to handle load balancer services. As a result of this choice, such clusters have a number of functional limitations.

{rh-openstack} Octavia has two supported providers: Amphora and OVN. These providers differ in terms of available features as well as implementation details. These distinctions affect load balancer services that are created on your cluster.
