= Example: Multiple interfaces in the same Policy

You can create multiple interfaces in the same Policy. These interfaces can reference each other, allowing you to build and deploy a network configuration by using a single Policy manifest.

The following example snippet creates a bond that is named `bond10` across two NICs and a Linux bridge that is named `br1` that connects to the bond.
