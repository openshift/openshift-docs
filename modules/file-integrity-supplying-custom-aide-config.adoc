= Supplying a custom AIDE configuration

Any entries that configure AIDE internal behavior such as `DBDIR`, `LOGDIR`,
`database`, and `database_out` are overwritten by the Operator. The Operator
would add a prefix to `/hostroot/` before all paths to be watched for integrity
changes. This makes reusing existing AIDE configs that might often not be
tailored for a containerized environment and start from the root directory
easier.

[NOTE]
====
`/hostroot` is the directory where the pods running AIDE mount the hostâ€™s
filesystem. Changing the configuration triggers a reinitializing of the database.
