= Adding tags to imagestreams

An imagestream in {product-title} comprises zero or more container images
identified by tags.

There are different types of tags available. The default behavior uses a
_permanent_ tag, which points to a specific image in time. If the _permanent_tag
is in use and the source changes, the tag does not change for the destination.

A _tracking_ tag means the destination tag's metadata is updated during the import
of the source tag.

.Procedure

* You can add tags to an imagestream using the `oc tag` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc tag <source> <destination>
----
+
For example, to configure the `ruby` imagestreams `static-2.0` tag to always
refer to the current image for the `ruby` imagestreams `2.0` tag:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc tag ruby:2.0 ruby:static-2.0
----
+
This creates a new imagestreamtag named `static-2.0` in the `ruby` imagestream.
The new tag directly references the image id that the `ruby:2.0`
imagestreamtag pointed to at the time `oc tag` was run, and the image it points
to never changes.

* To ensure the destination tag is updated whenever the source tag changes, use
the `--alias=true` flag:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc tag --alias=true <source> <destination>
----

[NOTE]
====
Use a _tracking_ tag for creating permanent aliases, for example, `latest` or
`stable`. The tag only works correctly within a single imagestream. Trying
to create a cross-imagestream alias produces an error.
====

* You can also add the `--scheduled=true` flag to have the destination tag be
refreshed, or re-imported, periodically. The period is configured globally at
the system level.

* The `--reference` flag creates an imagestreamtag that is not imported. The
tag points to the source location, permanently.
+
If you want to instruct OpenShift to always fetch the tagged image from the
integrated registry, use `--reference-policy=local`. The registry uses the
pull-through feature to serve the image to the client. By default, the image
blobs are mirrored locally by the registry. As a result, they can be pulled more
quickly the next time they are needed. The flag also allows for pulling from
insecure registries without a need to supply `--insecure-registry` to the container
runtime as long as the imagestream has an insecure annotation or the tag has an
insecure import policy.
