= Configuring policy compliance evaluation timeouts for {policy-gen-cr} CRs

Use {rh-rhacm-first} installed on a hub cluster to monitor and report on whether your managed clusters are compliant with applied policies. {rh-rhacm} uses policy templates to apply predefined policy controllers and policies. Policy controllers are Kubernetes custom resource definition (CRD) instances.

You can override the default policy evaluation intervals with `{policy-gen-cr}` custom resources (CRs). You configure duration settings that define how long a `ConfigurationPolicy` CR can be in a state of policy compliance or non-compliance before {rh-rhacm} re-evaluates the applied cluster policies.

The {ztp-first} policy generator generates `ConfigurationPolicy` CR policies with pre-defined policy evaluation intervals. The default value for the `noncompliant` state is 10 seconds. The default value for the `compliant` state is 10 minutes. To disable the evaluation interval, set the value to `never`.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data.

.Procedure

. To configure the evaluation interval for all policies in a `{policy-gen-cr}` CR, set appropriate `compliant` and `noncompliant` values for the `evaluationInterval` field.
For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
ifeval::["{policy-gen-cr}" == "PolicyGenTemplate"]
spec:
  evaluationInterval:
    compliant: 30m
    noncompliant: 20s
endif::[]
ifeval::["{policy-gen-cr}" == "PolicyGenerator"]
policyDefaults:
  evaluationInterval:
    compliant: 30m
    noncompliant: 45s
endif::[]
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You can also set `compliant` and `noncompliant` fields to `never` to stop evaluating the policy after it reaches particular compliance state.
====

. To configure the evaluation interval for an individual policy object in a `{policy-gen-cr}` CR, add the `evaluationInterval` field and set appropriate values.
For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
ifeval::["{policy-gen-cr}" == "PolicyGenTemplate"]
spec:
  sourceFiles:
    - fileName: SriovSubscription.yaml
      policyName: "sriov-sub-policy"
      evaluationInterval:
        compliant: never
        noncompliant: 10s
endif::[]
ifeval::["{policy-gen-cr}" == "PolicyGenerator"]
policies:
  - name: "sriov-sub-policy"
    manifests:
      - path: "SriovSubscription.yaml"
        evaluationInterval:
          compliant: never
          noncompliant: 10s
endif::[]
----

. Commit the `{policy-gen-cr}` CRs files in the Git repository and push your changes.

.Verification

Check that the managed spoke cluster policies are monitored at the expected intervals.

. Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges on the managed cluster.

. Get the pods that are running in the `open-cluster-management-agent-addon` namespace. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n open-cluster-management-agent-addon
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE
config-policy-controller-858b894c68-v4xdb    1/1     Running   22 (5d8h ago)   10d
----

. Check the applied policies are being evaluated at the expected interval in the logs for the `config-policy-controller` pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs -n open-cluster-management-agent-addon config-policy-controller-858b894c68-v4xdb
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
