= Configuring policy compliance evaluation timeouts for PolicyGenTemplate CRs

Use {rh-rhacm-first} installed on a hub cluster to monitor and report on whether your managed clusters are compliant with applied policies. {rh-rhacm} uses policy templates to apply predefined policy controllers and policies. Policy controllers are Kubernetes custom resource definition (CRD) instances.

You can override the default policy evaluation intervals with `PolicyGenTemplate` custom resources (CRs). You configure duration settings that define how long a `ConfigurationPolicy` CR can be in a state of policy compliance or non-compliance before {rh-rhacm} re-evaluates the applied cluster policies.

The {ztp-first} policy generator generates `ConfigurationPolicy` CR policies with pre-defined policy evaluation intervals. The default value for the `noncompliant` state is 10 seconds. The default value for the `compliant` state is 10 minutes. To disable the evaluation interval, set the value to `never`.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data.

.Procedure

. To configure the evaluation interval for all policies in a `PolicyGenTemplate` CR, add `evaluationInterval` to the `spec` field, and then set the appropriate `compliant` and `noncompliant` values. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  evaluationInterval:
    compliant: 30m
    noncompliant: 20s
----

. To configure the evaluation interval for the `spec.sourceFiles` object in a `PolicyGenTemplate` CR, add `evaluationInterval` to the `sourceFiles` field, for example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  sourceFiles:
   - fileName: SriovSubscription.yaml
     policyName: "sriov-sub-policy"
     evaluationInterval:
       compliant: never
       noncompliant: 10s
----

. Commit the `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs files in the Git repository and push your changes.

.Verification

Check that the managed spoke cluster policies are monitored at the expected intervals.

. Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges on the managed cluster.

. Get the pods that are running in the `open-cluster-management-agent-addon` namespace. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n open-cluster-management-agent-addon
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----

config-policy-controller-858b894c68-v4xdb    1/1     Running   22 (5d8h ago)   10d
----

. Check the applied policies are being evaluated at the expected interval in the logs for the `config-policy-controller` pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs -n open-cluster-management-agent-addon config-policy-controller-858b894c68-v4xdb
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
