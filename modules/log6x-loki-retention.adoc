= Enabling stream-based retention with Loki

You can configure retention policies based on log streams. Rules for these may be set globally, per-tenant, or both. If you configure both, tenant rules apply before global rules.

[NOTE]
====
This is not for managing the retention for stored logs. Global retention periods for stored logs to a supported maximum of 30 days is configured with your object storage.
