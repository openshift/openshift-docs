= About ingress traffic routing approaches

[role="_abstract"]
{SMProductName} offers two approaches to configure ingress traffic routing to services in the mesh. The approach depends on the service mesh deployment mode and traffic management requirements.

Ingress routing with gateway injection and {istio} APIs::
When you install a gateway by using gateway injection, you can configure it to receive ingress traffic by using the {istio} `Gateway` and `VirtualService` resources in combination.

The gateway injection approach is compatible with sidecar-based service mesh deployments where you enable sidecar injection in namespaces by using the `istio-injection=enabled` label or the `istio.io/rev=<revision>` label.

Ingress routing with {k8s} Gateway API::

The {k8s} Gateway API provides a standardized approach for configuring ingress traffic routing using native {k8s} resources. With this approach, you use `Gateway` and `HTTPRoute` (or `GRPCRoute`) resources to configure how traffic enters the mesh and routes to services.

While {istio} `Gateway` and `VirtualService` resources can be used for certain ingress use cases in ambient mode, the recommended approach is to use the {k8s} Gateway API, which provides full support and integration with ambient. You can also use the Gateway API with sidecar-based deployments.
