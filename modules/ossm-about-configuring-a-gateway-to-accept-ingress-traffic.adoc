= About configuring a gateway installed using gateway injection to accept ingress traffic

When you install a gateway using gateway injection you can configure it to receive ingress traffic using the {istio} `Gateway` and `VirtualService` resources in combination. The {istio} `Gateway` resource describes a load balancer operating at the edge of the mesh that receives incoming or outgoing HTTP/TCP connections. The `Gateway` specification describes a set of ports that should be exposed, the type of protocol to use, and the Server Name Indication (SNI) configuration for the load balancer. `VirtualServices` define routing rules to apply to an {istio} `Gateway`, similar to how you can use `VirtualServices` to define routing rules for internal mesh traffic.

In the following example an {istio} `Gateway` resource configures a gateway proxy to act as an entry point for external traffic. This configuration exposes port 443 (HTTPS) for the host, `bookinfo.com`. The example configuration applies to pods with the `istio: ingressgateway` label. The `tls` mode is configured as `SIMPLE`, which terminates the incoming HTTPS traffic using the certificate and private key the example provides.

.Sample configuration
[source,yaml,subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: bookinfo-gateway
  namespace: bookinfo
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 443
      name: https-443
      protocol: HTTPS
    hosts:
    - bookinfo.com
    tls:
      mode: SIMPLE
      serverCertificate: /etc/certs/servercert.pem
      privateKey: /etc/certs/privatekey.pem
----

The following `VirtualService` is bound to the {istio} `Gateway` resource shown in the previous example configuration. The specification defines rules to route traffic with the `/reviews/` path prefix to the reviews service in the `bookinfo` namespace. The `VirtualService` explicitly references the `Gateway` resource shown previously. This ensures that the routing rules are only applied to the traffic that enters through the specified gateway.

.Sample configuration
[source,yaml,subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: bookinfo-rule
  namespace: bookinfo
spec:
  hosts:
  - bookinfo.com
  gateways:
  - bookinfo/bookinfo-gateway
  http:
  - match:
    - uri:
        prefix: /reviews/
    route:
    - destination:
        port:
          number: 9080
        host: reviews.bookinfo.svc.cluster.local
