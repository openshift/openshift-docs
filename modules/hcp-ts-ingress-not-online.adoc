= Ingress and console cluster operators are not coming online

If a hosted control plane is not coming fully online because the Ingress and console cluster Operators are not online, check the wildcard DNS routes and load balancer.

.Procedure

* If the cluster uses the default Ingress behavior, enter the following command to ensure that wildcard DNS routes are enabled on the {product-title} cluster that the virtual machines (VMs) are hosted on:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch ingresscontroller -n openshift-ingress-operator \
  default --type=json -p \
  '[{ "op": "add", "path": "/spec/routeAdmission", "value": {wildcardPolicy: "WildcardsAllowed"}}]'
----

* If you use a custom base domain for the hosted control plane, complete the following steps:

** Ensure that the load balancer is targeting the VM pods correctly.
** Ensure that the wildcard DNS entry is targeting the load balancer IP address.
