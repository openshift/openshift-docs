= Modifying the Central custom resource

[role="_abstract"]
The Central DB service requires persistent storage. If you have not configured a default storage class for the Central cluster that is an SSD or is high performance, you must reinstall and configure the `Central` custom resource (CR) with the storage class for the Central DB persistent volume claim (PVC).

When changing the `storageClassName`, because of limitations with the Kubernetes storage layer, you cannot modify a claim's storage class after it is bound; therefore, you must re-create the Central CR.

[NOTE]
====
Skip this section if you have already configured a default storage class for Central.

.Procedure
. Back up and uninstall the Central instance.
. Reinstall {product-title-short} and configure the Central custom resource as shown in the following example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
spec:
  central:
    db:
      isEnabled: Default
      persistence:
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: central-db
          size: 100Gi
          storageClassName: <storage-class-name>
----
+
where:
+
--
`spec.central.db.isEnabled`:: Specifies that the database is enabled. Do not change this value from `IsEnabled` to `Enabled`.
`spec.central.db.persistence.persistentVolumeClaim`:: Specifies that your cluster uses the existing claim; otherwise, it creates a new claim.
--
. Restore the Central database backup by using the `roxctl` CLI.
