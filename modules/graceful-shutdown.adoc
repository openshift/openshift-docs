= Shutting down the cluster

You can shut down your cluster in a graceful manner so that it can be restarted at a later date.

[NOTE]
====
You can shut down a cluster until a year from the installation date and expect it to restart gracefully. After a year from the installation date, the cluster certificates expire.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have taken an etcd backup.

.Procedure

. If you are shutting the cluster down for an extended period, determine the date on which certificates expire and run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-kube-apiserver-operator get secret kube-apiserver-to-kubelet-signer -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations.auth\.openshift\.io/certificate-not-after}'
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
2022-08-05T14:37:50Zuser@user:~ $ <1>
----
<1> To ensure that the cluster can restart gracefully, plan to restart it on or before the specified date. As the cluster restarts, the process might require you to manually approve the pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates.

. Mark all the nodes in the cluster as unschedulable. You can do this from your cloud provider's web console, or by running the following loop:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ for node in $(oc get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'); do echo ${node} ; oc adm cordon ${node} ; done
----
+

. Evacuate the pods using the following method:
[source,terminal]
+
----
$ for node in $(oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/worker -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'); do echo ${node} ; oc adm drain ${node} --delete-emptydir-data --ignore-daemonsets=true --timeout=15s --force ; done
----

. Shut down all of the nodes in the cluster. You can do this from your cloud provider’s web console, or by running the following loop:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ for node in $(oc get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'); do oc debug node/${node} -- chroot /host shutdown -h 1; done
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Starting pod/ip-10-0-130-169us-east-2computeinternal-debug ...
To use host binaries, run `chroot /host`
Shutdown scheduled for Mon 2021-09-13 09:36:17 UTC, use 'shutdown -c' to cancel.

----

Shutting down the nodes using one of these methods allows pods to terminate gracefully, which reduces the chance for data corruption.
+
[NOTE]
====
Adjust the shut down time to be longer for large-scale clusters:

[source,terminal]
----
$ for node in $(oc get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'); do oc debug node/${node} -- chroot /host shutdown -h 10; done
----
====
+
[NOTE]
====
It is not necessary to drain control plane nodes of the standard pods that ship with {product-title} prior to shutdown.
Cluster administrators are responsible for ensuring a clean restart of their own workloads after the cluster is restarted. If you drained control plane nodes prior to shutdown because of custom workloads, you must mark the control plane nodes as schedulable before the cluster will be functional again after restart.
====

. Shut off any cluster dependencies that are no longer needed, such as external storage or an LDAP server. Be sure to consult your vendor's documentation before doing so.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you deployed your cluster on a cloud-provider platform, do not shut down, suspend, or delete the associated cloud resources. If you delete the cloud resources of a suspended virtual machine, {product-title} might not restore successfully.
