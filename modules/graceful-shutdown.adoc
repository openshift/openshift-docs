= Shutting down the cluster

You can shut down your cluster in a graceful manner so that it can be restarted at a later date.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have taken an etcd backup.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is important to take an etcd backup before performing this procedure so that your cluster can be restored if you encounter any issues when restarting the cluster.
====

.Procedure

. Shut down all of the nodes in the cluster. You can do this from your cloud provider's web console, or you can use the below commands:

.. Obtain the list of nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ nodes=$(oc get nodes -o name)
----

.. Shut down all of the nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ for node in ${nodes[@]}
do
    echo "==== Shut down $node ===="
    ssh core@$node sudo shutdown -h 1
done
----
+
Shutting down the nodes using one of these methods allows pods to terminate gracefully, which reduces the chance for data corruption.
+
[NOTE]
====
It is not necessary to drain master nodes of the standard pods that ship with {product-title} prior to shutdown.

Cluster administrators are responsible for ensuring a clean restart of their own workloads after the cluster is restarted. If you drained master nodes prior to shutdown because of custom workloads, you must mark the master nodes as schedulable before the cluster will be functional again after restart.
====

. Shut off any cluster dependencies that are no longer needed, such as external storage or an LDAP server. Be sure to consult your vendor's documentation before doing so.
