= Enabling {entra-first} on an existing cluster

If you did not configure your {azure-first} {product-title} cluster to use {entra-first} during installation, you can enable this authentication method on an existing cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The process to enable {entra-short} on an existing cluster is disruptive and takes a significant amount of time.
Before proceeding, observe the following considerations:

* Read the following steps and ensure that you understand and accept the time requirement.
The exact time requirement varies depending on the individual cluster, but it is likely to require at least one hour.

* During this process, you must refresh all service accounts and restart all pods on the cluster.
These actions are disruptive to workloads.
To mitigate this impact, you can temporarily halt these services and then redeploy them when the cluster is ready.

* After starting this process, do not attempt to update the cluster until it is complete.
If an update is triggered, the process to enable {entra-short} on an existing cluster fails.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed an {product-title} cluster on {azure-first}.
* You have access to the cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.
* You have extracted and prepared the Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`) binary.
* You have access to your {azure-short} account by using the {azure-short} CLI (`az`).

.Procedure

. Create an output directory for the manifests that the `ccoctl` utility generates.
This procedure uses `./output_dir` as an example.

. Extract the service account public signing key for the cluster to the output directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get configmap \
  --namespace openshift-kube-apiserver bound-sa-token-signing-certs \
  --output 'go-template={{index .data "service-account-001.pub"}}' > ./output_dir/serviceaccount-signer.public <1>
----
<1> This procedure uses a file named `serviceaccount-signer.public` as an example.

. Use the extracted service account public signing key to create an OpenID Connect (OIDC) issuer and {azure-short} blob storage container with OIDC configuration files by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./ccoctl azure create-oidc-issuer \
  --name <azure_infra_name> \// <1>
  --output-dir ./output_dir \
  --region <azure_region> \// <2>
  --subscription-id <azure_subscription_id> \// <3>
  --tenant-id <azure_tenant_id> \
  --public-key-file ./output_dir/serviceaccount-signer.public <4>
----
<1> The value of the `name` parameter is used to create an Azure resource group.
To use an existing Azure resource group instead of creating a new one, specify the `--oidc-resource-group-name` argument with the existing group name as its value.
<2> Specify the region of the existing cluster.
<3> Specify the subscription ID of the existing cluster.
<4> Specify the file that contains the service account public signing key for the cluster.

. Verify that the configuration file for the Azure pod identity webhook was created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ll ./output_dir/manifests
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,text]
----
total 8
-rw-------. 1 cloud-user cloud-user 193 May 22 02:29 azure-ad-pod-identity-webhook-config.yaml <1>
-rw-------. 1 cloud-user cloud-user 165 May 22 02:29 cluster-authentication-02-config.yaml
----
<1> The file `azure-ad-pod-identity-webhook-config.yaml` contains the Azure pod identity webhook configuration.

. Set an `OIDC_ISSUER_URL` variable with the OIDC issuer URL from the generated manifests in the output directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ OIDC_ISSUER_URL=`awk '/serviceAccountIssuer/ { print $2 }' ./output_dir/manifests/cluster-authentication-02-config.yaml`
----

. Update the `spec.serviceAccountIssuer` parameter of the cluster `authentication` configuration by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch authentication cluster \
  --type=merge \
  -p "{\"spec\":{\"serviceAccountIssuer\":\"${OIDC_ISSUER_URL}\"}}"
----

. Monitor the configuration update progress by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm wait-for-stable-cluster
----
+
This process might take 15 minutes or longer.
The following output indicates that the process is complete:
+
[source,text]
----
All clusteroperators are stable
----

. Restart all of the pods in the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm reboot-machine-config-pool mcp/worker mcp/master
----
+
Restarting a pod updates the `serviceAccountIssuer` field and refreshes the service account public signing key.

. Monitor the restart and update process by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm wait-for-node-reboot nodes --all
----
+
This process might take 15 minutes or longer.
The following output indicates that the process is complete:
+
[source,text]
----
All nodes rebooted
----

. Update the Cloud Credential Operator `spec.credentialsMode` parameter to `Manual` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch cloudcredential cluster \
  --type=merge \
  --patch '{"spec":{"credentialsMode":"Manual"}}'
----

. Extract the list of `CredentialsRequest` objects from the {product-title} release image by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release extract \
  --credentials-requests \
  --included \
  --to <path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests> \
  --registry-config ~/.pull-secret
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This command might take a few moments to run.
====

. Set an `AZURE_INSTALL_RG` variable with the {azure-short} resource group name by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ AZURE_INSTALL_RG=`oc get infrastructure cluster -o jsonpath --template '{ .status.platformStatus.azure.resourceGroupName }'`
----

. Use the `ccoctl` utility to create managed identities for all `CredentialsRequest` objects by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ccoctl azure create-managed-identities \
  --name <azure_infra_name> \
  --output-dir ./output_dir \
  --region <azure_region> \
  --subscription-id <azure_subscription_id> \
  --credentials-requests-dir <path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests> \
  --issuer-url "${OIDC_ISSUER_URL}" \
  --dnszone-resource-group-name <azure_dns_zone_resourcegroup_name> \// <1>
  --installation-resource-group-name "${AZURE_INSTALL_RG}"
----
<1> Specify the name of the resource group that contains the DNS zone.

. Apply the {azure-short} pod identity webhook configuration for {entra-short} by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f ./output_dir/manifests/azure-ad-pod-identity-webhook-config.yaml
----

. Apply the secrets generated by the `ccoctl` utility by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ find ./output_dir/manifests -iname "openshift*yaml" -print0 | xargs -I {} -0 -t oc replace -f {}
----
+
This process might take several minutes.


. Restart all of the pods in the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm reboot-machine-config-pool mcp/worker mcp/master
----
+
Restarting a pod updates the `serviceAccountIssuer` field and refreshes the service account public signing key.

. Monitor the restart and update process by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm wait-for-node-reboot nodes --all
----
+
This process might take 15 minutes or longer.
The following output indicates that the process is complete:
+
[source,text]
----
All nodes rebooted
----

. Monitor the configuration update progress by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm wait-for-stable-cluster
----
+
This process might take 15 minutes or longer.
The following output indicates that the process is complete:
+
[source,text]
----
All clusteroperators are stable
----

. Optional: Remove the {azure-short} root credentials secret by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete secret -n kube-system azure-credentials
----
