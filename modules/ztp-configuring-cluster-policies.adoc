= Configuring managed clusters with policies and PolicyGenTemplate resources

{ztp-first} uses {rh-rhacm-first} to configure clusters by using a policy-based governance approach to applying the configuration.

The policy generator or `PolicyGen` is a plugin for the GitOps Operator that enables the creation of {rh-rhacm} policies from a concise template. The tool can combine multiple CRs into a single policy, and you can generate multiple policies that apply to various subsets of clusters in your fleet.

[NOTE]
====
For scalability and to reduce the complexity of managing configurations across the fleet of clusters, use configuration CRs with as much commonality as possible.

* Where possible, apply configuration CRs using a fleet-wide common policy.

* The next preference is to create logical groupings of clusters to manage as much of the remaining configurations as possible under a group policy.

* When a configuration is unique to an individual site, use {rh-rhacm} templating on the hub cluster to inject the site-specific data into a common or group policy. Alternatively, apply an individual site policy for the site.

The following diagram shows how the policy generator interacts with GitOps and {rh-rhacm} in the configuration phase of cluster deployment.

For large fleets of clusters, it is typical for there to be a high-level of consistency in the configuration of those clusters.

The following recommended structuring of policies combines configuration CRs to meet several goals:

* Describe common configurations once and apply to the fleet.

* Minimize the number of maintained and managed policies.

* Support flexibility in common configurations for cluster variants.

|====
|Policy category
|Description

|Common
|A policy that exists in the common category is applied to all clusters in the fleet. Use common `{policy-gen-cr}` CRs to apply common installation settings across all cluster types.

|Groups
|A policy that exists in the groups category is applied to a group of clusters in the fleet. Use group `{policy-gen-cr}` CRs to manage specific aspects of single-node, three-node, and standard cluster installations. Cluster groups can also follow geographic region, hardware variant, etc.

|Sites
|A policy that exists in the sites category is applied to a specific cluster site. Any cluster
can have its own specific policies maintained.
