= Disk partitioning

In most cases, data partitions are originally created by installing {op-system}, rather than by installing another operating system. In such cases, the {product-title} installer should be allowed to configure your disk partitions.

However, there are two cases where you might want to intervene to override the default partitioning when installing an
{product-title} node:

* Create separate partitions: For greenfield installations on an empty
disk, you might want to add separate storage to a partition. This is
officially supported for making `/var` or a subdirectory of `/var`, such as `/var/lib/etcd`, a separate partition, but not both.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Kubernetes supports only two filesystem partitions. If you add more than one partition to the original configuration, Kubernetes cannot monitor all of them.
====
* Retain existing partitions: For a brownfield installation where you are reinstalling {product-title} on an existing node and want to retain data partitions installed from your previous operating system, there are both boot arguments and options to `coreos-installer` that allow you to retain existing data partitions.

= Creating a separate `/var` partition
In general, disk partitioning for {product-title} should be left to the
installer. However, there are cases where you might want to create separate partitions in a part of the filesystem that you expect to grow.

{product-title} supports the addition of a single partition to attach
storage to either the `/var` partition or a subdirectory of `/var`.
For example:

* `/var/lib/containers`: Holds container-related content that can grow
as more images and containers are added to a system.
* `/var/lib/etcd`: Holds data that you might want to keep separate for purposes such as performance optimization of etcd storage.
* `/var`: Holds data that you might want to keep separate for purposes such as auditing.

Storing the contents of a `/var` directory separately makes it easier to grow storage for those areas as needed and reinstall {product-title} at a later date and keep that data intact. With this method, you will not have to pull all your containers again, nor will you have to copy massive log files when you update systems.

Because `/var` must be in place before a fresh installation of
{op-system-first}, the following procedure sets up the separate `/var` partition
by creating a machine config manifest that is inserted during the `openshift-install`
preparation phases of an {product-title} installation.

.Procedure

. Create a directory to hold the {product-title} installation files:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir $HOME/clusterconfig
----

. Run `openshift-install` to create a set of files in the `manifest` and
`openshift` subdirectories. Answer the system questions as you are prompted:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install create manifests --dir $HOME/clusterconfig
? SSH Public Key ...
$ ls $HOME/clusterconfig/openshift/
99_kubeadmin-password-secret.yaml
99_openshift-cluster-api_master-machines-0.yaml
99_openshift-cluster-api_master-machines-1.yaml
99_openshift-cluster-api_master-machines-2.yaml
...
----

. Create a Butane config that configures the additional partition. For example, name the file `$HOME/clusterconfig/98-var-partition.bu`, change the disk device name to the name of the storage device on the `worker` systems, and set the storage size as appropriate. This example places the `/var` directory on a separate partition:
+
[source,yaml]
----
variant: openshift
version: 4.9.0
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
  name: 98-var-partition
storage:
  disks:
  - device: /dev/<device_name> <1>
    partitions:
    - label: var
      start_mib: <partition_start_offset> <2>
      size_mib: <partition_size> <3>
  filesystems:
    - device: /dev/disk/by-partlabel/var
      path: /var
      format: xfs
      mount_options: [defaults, prjquota] <4>
      with_mount_unit: true
----
+
<1> The storage device name of the disk that you want to partition.
<2> When adding a data partition to the boot disk, a minimum value of 25000 mebibytes is recommended. The root file system is automatically resized to fill all available space up to the specified offset. If no value is specified, or if the specified value is smaller than the recommended minimum, the resulting root file system will be too small, and future reinstalls of {op-system} might overwrite the beginning of the data partition.
<3> The size of the data partition in mebibytes.
<4> The `prjquota` mount option must be enabled for filesystems used for container storage.
+
[NOTE]
====
When creating a separate `/var` partition, you cannot use different instance types for worker nodes, if the different instance types do not have the same device name.
====

. Create a manifest from the Butane config and save it to the `clusterconfig/openshift` directory. For example, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ butane $HOME/clusterconfig/98-var-partition.bu -o $HOME/clusterconfig/openshift/98-var-partition.yaml
----

. Run `openshift-install` again to create Ignition configs from a set of files in the `manifest` and `openshift` subdirectories:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install create ignition-configs --dir $HOME/clusterconfig
$ ls $HOME/clusterconfig/
auth  bootstrap.ign  master.ign  metadata.json  worker.ign
----

Now you can use the Ignition config files as input to the vSphere installation procedures to install {op-system-first} systems.
