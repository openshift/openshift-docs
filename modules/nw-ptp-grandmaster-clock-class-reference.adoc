= Grandmaster clock class sync state reference

The following table describes the PTP grandmaster clock (T-GM) `gm.ClockClass` states.
Clock class states categorize T-GM clocks based on their accuracy and stability with regard to the Primary Reference Time Clock (PRTC) or other timing source.

Holdover specification is the amount of time a PTP clock can maintain synchronization without receiving updates from the primary time source.

|Clock class state
|Description

|`gm.ClockClass 6`
|T-GM clock is connected to a PRTC in `LOCKED` mode.
For example, the PRTC is traceable to a GNSS time source.

|`gm.ClockClass 7`
|T-GM clock is in `HOLDOVER` mode, and within holdover specification.
The clock source might not be traceable to a category 1 frequency source.

|`gm.ClockClass 140`
|T-GM clock is in `HOLDOVER` mode, is out of holdover specification, but it is still traceable to the category 1 frequency source.

|`gm.ClockClass 248`
|T-GM clock is in `FREERUN` mode.
