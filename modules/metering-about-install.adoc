= About Installing Metering

Metering leverages a SQL database called Presto.
Presto does not store the data itself. Instead, its storage is decoupled from it, often in the form of object storage.
This means at a minimum you need to configure persistent storage to hold reporting data, and the Hive metastore to hold metadata about database tables managed by Presto and Hive.
