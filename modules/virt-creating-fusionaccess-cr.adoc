= Creating the FusionAccess CR

[role="_abstract"]
After installing the {FusionSAN} Operator and creating a Kubernetes pull secret, you must create the `FusionAccess` custom resource (CR).

Creating the `FusionAccess` CR triggers the installation of the correct version of IBM Storage Scale and detects worker nodes with shared LUNs.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You installed the {FusionSAN} Operator.
* You created a Kubernetes pull secret.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console, navigate to *Ecosystem* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Click on the {FusionSAN} Operator you installed.

. In the *Fusion Access for SAN* page, select the *Fusion Access* tab.

. Click *Create FusionAccess*.

. On the *Create FusionAccess* page, enter the object *Name*.

. Optional: You can choose to add *Labels* if they are relevant.

. Select the *IBM Storage Scale Version* from the drop-down list.

. Click *Create*.

.Verification

* In the *Fusion Access for SAN* Operator page, in the *Fusion Access* tab, verify that the created `FusionAccess` CR appears with the status *Ready*.
