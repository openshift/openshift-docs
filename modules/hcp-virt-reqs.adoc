= Requirements to deploy {hcp} on {VirtProductName}

As you prepare to deploy {hcp} on {VirtProductName}, consider the following information:

* Run the management cluster on bare metal.
* Each hosted cluster must have a cluster-wide unique name.
* Do not use `clusters` as a hosted cluster name.
* A hosted cluster cannot be created in the namespace of a {mce-short} managed cluster.
* When you configure storage for {hcp}, consider the recommended etcd practices. To ensure that you meet the latency requirements, dedicate a fast storage device to all hosted control plane etcd instances that run on each control-plane node. You can use LVM storage to configure a local storage class for hosted etcd pods. For more information, see "Recommended etcd practices" and "Persistent storage using Logical Volume Manager storage".
