= About HostedCluster and NodePool version compatibility

In {hcp}, ensure to check that your `NodePool` version is compatible with your `HostedCluster` version by reviewing the following rules:

* The `NodePool` version cannot be higher than the `HostedCluster` version.
** For `4.<x>` versions, where `<x>` is an _even_ release number, such as 4.18, you must use up to 2 minor versions, for example, 4.17 and 4.16.
** For `4.<x>` versions, where `<x>` is an _odd_ release number, such as 4.17, you must use up to 1 minor version, for example, 4.16.

* The `NodePool` controller sets the `SupportedVersionSkew` condition by default to report one of the following version compatibility statuses:
** `True`: Indicates that the `NodePool` version is compatible with the HostedCluster version.
** `False`: Indicates that the `NodePool` version is incompatible with detailed error messages. If you see the version incompatibility issues, you must upgrade or downgrade `NodePool` to a compatible version.
