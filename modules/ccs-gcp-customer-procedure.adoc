The Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) model allows Red Hat to deploy and manage {product-title} into a customer's Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project. Red Hat requires several prerequisites to provide these services.

[WARNING]
====
To use {product-title} in your GCP project, the following GCP organizational policy constraints cannot be in place:

* `constraints/iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains`
* `constraints/compute.restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypes`
* `constraints/compute.requireShieldedVm`
* `constraints/compute.vmExternalIpAccess` (This policy constraint is unsupported only during installation. You can re-enable the policy constraint after installation.)
