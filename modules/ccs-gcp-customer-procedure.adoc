The Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) model allows Red Hat to deploy and manage {product-title} into a customer's Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project. Red Hat requires several prerequisites to provide these services.
[NOTE]
====
The following requirements in this topic apply to {product-title} on {GCP} clusters created using both the service account and Workload Identity Federation authentication type. For additional requirements that apply to the service account authentication type only, see _Service account authentication type procedure_. For additional requirements that apply to the Workload Identity Federation authentication type only, see _Workload Identity Federation authentication type procedure_.
====

[WARNING]
====
To use {product-title} in your GCP project, the following GCP organizational policy constraints cannot be in place:

* `constraints/iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains` (This policy constraint is supported only if Red Hat's `DIRECTORY_CUSTOMER_ID C02k0l5e8` is included in the allow list. Use this policy constraint with caution).
* `constraints/compute.restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypes`
* `constraints/compute.requireShieldedVm` (This policy constraint is supported only if the cluster is installed with "Enable Secure Boot support for Shielded VMs" selected during the initial cluster creation).
* `constraints/compute.vmExternalIpAccess` (This policy constraint is supported only after installation).
