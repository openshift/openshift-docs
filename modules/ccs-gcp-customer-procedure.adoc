= Required customer procedure

The Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) model allows Red{nbsp}Hat to deploy and manage {product-title} into a customer's Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project. Red Hat requires several prerequisites to provide these services.
[NOTE]
====
The following requirements in this topic apply to {product-title} on {GCP} clusters created using both the service account and Workload Identity Federation authentication type. For additional requirements that apply to the service account authentication type only, see _Service account authentication type procedure_. For additional requirements that apply to the Workload Identity Federation authentication type only, see _Workload Identity Federation authentication type procedure_.
====

.Prerequisites

Before using {product-title} in your GCP project, confirm that the following organizational policy constraints are configured correctly where applicable:

* `constraints/iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains`
** This policy constraint is supported only if Red{nbsp}Hat's Directory Customer ID's `C02k0l5e8` and `C04j7mbwl` are included in the allowlist.
* `constraints/compute.restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypes`
** This policy constraint is supported only when creating a private cluster with GCP Private Service Connect (PSC). You must ensure that the `INTERNAL_TCP_UDP` load balancer type is included in the allowlist or excluded from the deny list.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Although the `EXTERNAL_NETWORK_TCP_UDP` load balancer type is not required when creating a private cluster with GCP Private Service Connect (PSC), disallowing it via this constraint will prevent the cluster from being able to create externally accessible load balancers.
====

* `constraints/compute.requireShieldedVm`
** This policy constraint is supported only if the cluster is created with *Enable Secure Boot support for Shielded VMs* selected during the initial cluster creation.
* `constraints/compute.vmExternalIpAccess`
** This policy constraint is supported only when creating a private cluster with GCP Private Service Connect (PSC). For all other cluster types, this policy constraint is supported only after cluster creation.
