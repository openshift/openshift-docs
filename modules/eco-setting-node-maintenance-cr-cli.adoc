[id="eco-setting-node-maintenance-cr-cli_{context}"]
= Setting a node to maintenance mode by using the CLI

You can put a node into maintenance mode with a `NodeMaintenance` custom resource (CR). When you apply a `NodeMaintenance` CR, all allowed pods are evicted and the node is rendered unschedulable. Evicted pods are queued to be moved to another node in the cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Install the {product-title} CLI `oc`.
* Log in to the cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Create the following `NodeMaintenance` CR, and save the file as `nodemaintenance-cr.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: nodemaintenance.medik8s.io/v1beta1
kind: NodeMaintenance
metadata:
  name: nodemaintenance-cr  <1>
spec:
  nodeName: node-1.example.com <2>
  reason: "NIC replacement" <3>
----
<1> The name of the node maintenance CR.
<2> The name of the node to be put into maintenance mode.
<3> A plain text description of the reason for maintenance.
+
.  Apply the node maintenance CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f nodemaintenance-cr.yaml
----

.Verification

. Check the progress of the maintenance task by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe node <node-name>
----
+
where `<node-name>` is the name of your node; for example, `node-1.example.com`

. Check the example output:
+
[source,terminal]
