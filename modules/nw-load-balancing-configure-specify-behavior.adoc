= Specify load balancer behavior for an Ingress Controller

After you install a cluster, you can configure your Ingress Controller to specify how services are exposed to external networks, so that you can better control the settings and behavior of a load balancer.

[NOTE]
====
Changing the load balancer settings on an Ingress Controller might override the load balancer settings you specified at installation.
