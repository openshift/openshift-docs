= Upgrading the {sno} cluster with {lcao}

Once you generated the seed image and completed the `Prep` stage, you can upgrade the target cluster.
During the upgrade process, the OADP Operator creates a backup of the artifacts specified in the OADP CRs, then the {lcao} upgrades the cluster.

If the upgrade fails or stops, an automatic rollback is initiated.
If you have an issue after the upgrade, you can initiate a manual rollback.
For more information about manual rollback, see "(Optional) Initiating rollback of the {sno} clusters after an image-based upgrade".

[IMPORTANT]
====
During the Developer Preview of this feature, when upgrading a cluster, any custom trusted certificates configured on the cluster will be lost. As a temporary workaround, to preserve these certificates, you must use a seed image from a seed cluster that trusts the certificates.

.Prerequisites

* Complete the `Prep` stage.

.Procedure

. When you are ready, move to the upgrade stage by changing the value of the `stage` field to `Upgrade` in the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch imagebasedupgrades.lca.openshift.io example-upgrade -p='{"spec": {"stage": "Upgrade"}}' --type=merge
----

. Check the status of the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ibu -A -oyaml

. The OADP Operator creates a backup of the data specified in the OADP `Backup` and `Restore` CRs.

. The target cluster reboots.

. Monitor the status of the CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ibu -A -oyaml
----

. The cluster reboots.

. Once you are satisfied with the upgrade, commit to the changes by changing the value of the `stage` field to `Idle` in the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch imagebasedupgrades.lca.openshift.io example-upgrade -p='{"spec": {"stage": "Idle"}}' --type=merge
----

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot roll back the changes once you move to the `Idle` stage after an upgrade.
====

--
The {lcao} deletes all resources created during the upgrade process.
