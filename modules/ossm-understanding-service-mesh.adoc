= What is {SMProductName}?

A _service mesh_ is the network of microservices that make up applications in a distributed microservice architecture and the interactions between those microservices. When a {SMProductShortName} grows in size and complexity, it can become harder to understand and manage.

Based on the open source link:https://istio.io/[Istio] project, {SMProductName} adds a transparent layer on existing distributed applications without requiring any changes to the service code. You add {SMProductName} support to services by deploying a special sidecar proxy to relevant services in the mesh that intercepts all network communication between microservices. You configure and manage the {SMProductShortName} using the {SMProductShortName} control plane features.

{SMProductName} gives you an easy way to create a network of deployed services that provide:

* Discovery
* Load balancing
* Service-to-service authentication
* Failure recovery
* Metrics
* Monitoring

{SMProductName} also provides more complex operational functions including:

* A/B testing
* Canary releases
* Access control
* End-to-end authentication
