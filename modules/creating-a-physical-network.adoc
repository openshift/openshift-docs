= Creating a physical network by using the {product-title} web console

[role="_abstract"]
You can create physical networks for {VirtProductName} using the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites
* Install {product-title} {product-version} on your cluster.
* Log in to the {product-title} web console as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.

.Procedure

. From the *Virtualization* perspective, click *Physical networks*.

. Click *Create network*. The *Network configuration wizard* is displayed.

. In the *Network configuration wizard*.

. In the *Network identity* step, enter a name for your network.

. In the *Nodes configuration* step select whether to apply the network to all nodes on the cluster, or to apply the network to a specific subset of nodes.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you select specific nodes, you can view the matching nodes list to ensure the selection is correct. A validation error appears if the selected nodes overlap with another configuration associated with the same network.
====

. In the *Uplink connection* step, select the network uplink that will provide connectivity to the physical network:
+
* **Default node network**: Uses the default node network to access the outside physical network.
* **A single interface**: Select a specific physical network interface from the list.
+
[WARNING]
====
If the selected secondary interface is configured with an IP address on some of the nodes, using it as an uplink removes the IP address and might disrupt network services.
====
* **Bonding interface**: Configures bonded network interfaces to achieve resilience and higher throughput.
.. Enter a **Bonding name**.
.. Select the **Network interfaces** to bond.
.. Select the **Aggregation mode** from the drop down options.

. In the *Settings* step, provide a **Bridge name** and set the **Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)**.

. Review the configuration details.

. Click *Create*.

.Verification

* Navigate to the *Networking* -> *Physical networks* page.
* Locate your new network in the list.
* Expand the network row to view the associated configurations. Verify that the **Enactment state** is **Available** and that the **Nodes** count matches your expectation.
