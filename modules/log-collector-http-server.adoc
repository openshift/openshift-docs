= Configuring the collector to receive audit logs as an HTTP server

You can configure your log collector to listen for HTTP connections and receive audit logs as an HTTP server by specifying `http` as a receiver input in the `ClusterLogForwarder` custom resource (CR). This enables you to use a common log store for audit logs that are collected from both inside and outside of your {product-title} cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You have administrator permissions.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.
* You have installed the {clo}.
* You have created a `ClusterLogForwarder` CR.

.Procedure

. Modify the `ClusterLogForwarder` CR to add configuration for the `http` receiver input:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: logging.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterLogForwarder
metadata:
# ...
spec:
  serviceAccountName: <service_account_name>
  inputs:
    - name: http-receiver # <1>
      receiver:
        type: http # <2>
        http:
          format: kubeAPIAudit # <3>
          port: 8443 # <4>
  pipelines: # <5>
    - name: http-pipeline
      inputRefs:
        - http-receiver
# ...
----
<1> Specify a name for your input receiver.
<2> Specify the input receiver type as `http`.
<3> Currently, only the the `kube-apiserver` webhook format is supported for `http` input receivers.
<4> Optional: Specify the port that the input receiver listens on. This must be a value between `1024` and `65535`. The default value is `8443` if this is not specified.
<5> Configure a pipeline for your input receiver.

. Apply the changes to the `ClusterLogForwarder` CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
