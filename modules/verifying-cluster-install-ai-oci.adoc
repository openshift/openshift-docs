= Verifying a successful cluster installation on {oci-distributed-no-rt}

Verify that your cluster was installed and is running effectively on {oci-distributed}.

.Procedure

. From the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console], go to *Clusters > Assisted Clusters* and select your cluster's name.

. On the *Installation Progress* page, check that the Installation progress bar is at 100% and a message displays indicating `Installation completed successfully`.

. Under *Host inventory*, confirm that the status of all control plane and compute nodes is `Installed`.

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} designates one of the control plane nodes as the bootstrap virtual machine, eliminating the need for a separate bootstrap machine.

. Click the Web Console URL, to access the {product-title} web console.

. From the menu, select *Compute > Nodes*.

. Locate your node from the *Nodes* table.

. From the *Terminal* tab, verify that iSCSI appears next to the serial number.

. From the *Overview* tab, check that your node has a *Ready* status.

. Select the *YAML* tab.

. Check the `labels` parameter, and verify that the listed labels apply to your configuration. For example, the `topology.kubernetes.io/region=us-sanjose-1` label indicates in what {oci-distributed-no-rt} region the node was deployed.
