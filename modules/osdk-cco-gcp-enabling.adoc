= Enabling Operators to support CCO-based workflows with {gcp-wid-short}

As an Operator author designing your project to run on Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), you can enable your Operator to authenticate against {gcp-wid-first} on {product-title} clusters by customizing your project to support the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO).

With this method, the Operator is responsible for and requires RBAC permissions for creating the `CredentialsRequest` object and reading the resulting `Secret` object.

[NOTE]
====
By default, pods related to the Operator deployment mount a `serviceAccountToken` volume so that the service account token can be referenced in the resulting `Secret` object.
====

.Prerequisities

* {product-title} 4.17 or later
* Cluster in *{gcp-wid-short} / Federated Identity* mode
* OLM-based Operator project

.Procedure

. Update your Operator project's `ClusterServiceVersion` (CSV) object:

.. Ensure Operator deployment in the CSV has the following `volumeMounts` and `volumes` fields so that the Operator can assume the role with web identity:
+
.Example `volumeMounts` and `volumes` fields
[%collapsible]
====
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
      volumeMounts:
  
      - name: bound-sa-token
        mountPath: /var/run/secrets/openshift/serviceaccount
        readOnly: true
      volumes:
         # This service account token can be used to provide identity outside the cluster.
         - name: bound-sa-token
           projected:
             sources:
             - serviceAccountToken:
               path: token
               audience: openshift
----
====

.. Ensure your Operator has RBAC permission to create `CredentialsRequests` objects:
+
.Example `clusterPermissions` list
[%collapsible]
====
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
install:
  spec:
    clusterPermissions:
    - rules:
      - apiGroups:
        - "cloudcredential.openshift.io"
        resources:
        - credentialsrequests
        verbs:
        - create
        - delete
        - get
        - list
        - patch
        - update
        - watch
----
====

.. Add the following annotation to claim support for this method of CCO-based workflow with {gcp-wid-short}:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
metadata:
 annotations:
   features.operators.openshift.io/token-auth-gcp: "true"
----

. Update your Operator project code:

.. Get the `audience` and the `serviceAccountEmail` values from the environment variables set on the pod by the subscription config:
+
[source,go]
----
 // Get ENV var
   audience := os.Getenv("AUDIENCE")
   serviceAccountEmail := os.Getenv("SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL")
   gcpIdentityTokenFile := "/var/run/secrets/openshift/serviceaccount/token"
----

.. Ensure you have a `CredentialsRequest` object ready to be patched and applied.
+
[NOTE]
====
Adding a `CredentialsRequest` object to the Operator bundle is not currently supported.
====

.. Add the {gcp-wid-short} variables to the credentials request and apply it during Operator initialization:
+
.Example applying `CredentialsRequest` object during Operator initialization
[%collapsible]
====
[source,go]
----
// apply CredentialsRequest on install
   credReqTemplate.Spec.GCPProviderSpec.Audience = audience
   credReqTemplate.Spec.GCPProviderSpec.ServiceAccountEmail = serviceAccountEmail
   credReqTemplate.CloudTokenPath = gcpIdentityTokenFile


   c := mgr.GetClient()
   if err := c.Create(context.TODO(), credReq); err != nil {
       if !errors.IsAlreadyExists(err) {
           setupLog.Error(err, "unable to create CredRequest")
           os.Exit(1)
       }
   }
----
====

.. Ensure your Operator can wait for a `Secret` object to show up from the CCO, as shown in the following example, which is called along with the other items you are reconciling in your Operator:
+
.Example wait for `Secret` object
[%collapsible]
====
[source,go]
----
// WaitForSecret is a function that takes a Kubernetes client, a namespace, and a v1 "k8s.io/api/core/v1" name as arguments
// It waits until the secret object with the given name exists in the given namespace
// It returns the secret object or an error if the timeout is exceeded
func WaitForSecret(client kubernetes.Interface, namespace, name string) (*v1.Secret, error) {
  // set a timeout of 10 minutes
  timeout := time.After(10 * time.Minute) <1>

  // set a polling interval of 10 seconds
  ticker := time.NewTicker(10 * time.Second)

  // loop until the timeout or the secret is found
  for {
     select {
     case <-timeout:
        // timeout is exceeded, return an error
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("timed out waiting for secret %s in namespace %s", name, namespace)
// add to this error with a pointer to instructions for following a manual path to a Secret that will work
     case <-ticker.C:
        // polling interval is reached, try to get the secret
        secret, err := client.CoreV1().Secrets(namespace).Get(context.Background(), name, metav1.GetOptions{})
        if err != nil {
           if errors.IsNotFound(err) {
              // secret does not exist yet, continue waiting
              continue
           } else {
              // some other error occurred, return it
              return nil, err
           }
        } else {
           // secret is found, return it
           return secret, nil
        }
     }
  }
}
----
<1> The `timeout` value is based on an estimate of how fast the CCO might detect an added `CredentialsRequest` object and generate a `Secret` object. You might consider lowering the time or creating custom feedback for cluster administrators that could be wondering why the Operator is not yet accessing the cloud resources.
====

.. Read the `service_account.json` field from the secret and use it to authenticate your {gcp-short} client:
+
[source,go]
----
service_account_json := secret.StringData["service_account.json"]
