= Understanding Connectivity Explanations

[role="_abstract"]
To understand precisely which parts of your Kubernetes network policy YAML files are responsible for allowing or denying connections, you can use the `roxctl netpol connectivity map` command which includes an explainability mode.
You can debug and refine your network policies by using the explainability mode which provides additional details beyond the standard connectivity report.

As a developer or DevOps professional, you might encounter situations where a connection you expect to be open is denied, or you need to confirm which specific rules allow the connection.

The following are examples of some common issues:

* Mismatched ingress and egress rules, where one side of a connection allows traffic but the other denies it.
* Typographical errors that cause policies to open different ports or protocols than intended.

The explainability mode provides insights into how each side of a connection is affected by your policy rules. You can quickly identify the configuration mistakes by using the explainability mode.

== Example allowed connections

Consider that you have a Kubernetes cluster with the following components:

* A *Monitoring service* called `monitoring-service` that collects data from various applications.
* A core *Internal application A* called `internal-app-a` that actively exposes monitoring endpoints and needs monitoring.
* A network policy configuration that defines Admin Network Policy (ANP) to `pass` connections from monitoring into namespaces with label `security: internal`, and a specific Network Policy (NP) that explicitly allows connections from `monitoring-service` into `internal-app-a`.

You can see the YAML manifest for this example at link:https://github.com/np-guard/netpol-analyzer/tree/0ac857e19bfab4b281ca9bdfb2bbc5ea319b5065/tests/anp_banp_explain_demo[`netpol-analyzer/tests/anp_banp_explain_demo/`].

To analyze the network policies and provides an explanation for each connection, you can run the `roxctl netpol connectivity map --explain` command on this setup.

The explainability output for allowed connections from the `monitoring-service` deployment for such configuration shows:

[source,terminal]
----
Connections between monitoring/monitoring-service[Pod] => internal-apps/internal-app-a[Pod]:
Allowed connections:
	Allowed TCP, UDP, SCTP due to the following policies and rules:
	    Egress (Allowed) due to the system default (Allow all)
	    Ingress (Allowed)
	        AdminNetworkPolicy 'pass-monitoring' passes connections by Ingress rule pass-ingress-from-monitoring
	        NetworkPolicy 'internal-apps/allow-monitoring' allows connections by Ingress rule #1
----

In this example, the connection from `monitoring/monitoring-service` to `internal-apps/internal-app-a` is allowed by the combination of ANP `pass-monitoring` that applies broadly on all namespaces with the label `security: internal` and a more specific NP `internal-apps/allow-monitoring` tailored for `internal-app-a`. The output shows that multiple policies can contribute to allowing a connection.

== Example blocked connections

Consider an isolated data service `isolated-data-service` which denies all external access by default for security reasons.

You can see the YAML manifest for this example at link:https://github.com/np-guard/netpol-analyzer/tree/7ab6bbd421d3d80cbfff7cd1529ff8caf0137fbc/tests/anp_banp_explain_demo_2[`netpol-analyzer/tests/anp_banp_explain_demo_2/`].

To analyze the network policies and provides an explanation for each connection, you can run the `roxctl netpol connectivity map --explain` command on this setup.

The explainability output for blocked connections from the `monitoring-service` deployment to this workload shows:

[source,terminal]
----
Connections between monitoring/monitoring-service[Pod] => isolated-apps/isolated-data-service[Pod]:

Denied connections:
	Denied TCP, UDP, SCTP due to the following policies and rules:
	    Egress (Allowed) due to the system default (Allow all)
	    Ingress (Denied)
	        AdminNetworkPolicy 'pass-monitoring' passes connections by Ingress rule pass-ingress-from-monitoring
	        BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy 'default' denies connections by Ingress rule deny-ingress-from-monitoring
----

In this example, the connection to `data/isolated-data-service` is blocked by a combination of ANP with Pass action, and of BANP that denies all connections from `monitoring` by default.
