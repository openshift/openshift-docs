= Cluster Network Operator configuration

The configuration for the cluster network is specified as part of the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration and stored in a custom resource (CR) object that is named `cluster`. The CR specifies the fields for the `Network` API in the `operator.openshift.io` API group.

The CNO configuration inherits the following fields during cluster installation from the `Network` API in the `Network.config.openshift.io` API group and these fields cannot be changed:

`clusterNetwork`:: IP address pools from which pod IP addresses are allocated.
`serviceNetwork`:: IP address pool for services.
`defaultNetwork.type`:: Cluster network plugin, such as OpenShift SDN or OVN-Kubernetes.

// For the post installation assembly, no further content is provided.

endif::[]
ifndef::post-install-network-configuration[]
You can specify the cluster network plugin configuration for your cluster by setting the fields for the `defaultNetwork` object in the CNO object named `cluster`.

[cols=".^3,.^2,.^5a",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`type`
|`string`
|Either `OpenShiftSDN` or `OVNKubernetes`. The {openshift-networking} network plugin is selected during installation. This value cannot be changed after cluster installation.
[NOTE]
====
{product-title} uses the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin by default.
====

|`openshiftSDNConfig`

==== Configuration for the OpenShift SDN network plugin

The following table describes the configuration fields for the OpenShift SDN network plugin:

.`openshiftSDNConfig` object
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6a",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`mode`
|`string`
|
ifndef::operator[]
Configures the network isolation mode for OpenShift SDN. The default value is `NetworkPolicy`.

The values `Multitenant` and `Subnet` are available for backwards compatibility with {product-title} 3.x but are not recommended. This value cannot be changed after cluster installation.
endif::operator[]
ifdef::operator[]
The network isolation mode for OpenShift SDN.
endif::operator[]

|`mtu`
|`integer`
|
ifndef::operator[]
The maximum transmission unit (MTU) for the VXLAN overlay network. This is detected automatically based on the MTU of the primary network interface. You do not normally need to override the detected MTU.

If the auto-detected value is not what you expect it to be, confirm that the MTU on the primary network interface on your nodes is correct. You cannot use this option to change the MTU value of the primary network interface on the nodes.

If your cluster requires different MTU values for different nodes, you must set this value to `50` less than the lowest MTU value in your cluster. For example, if some nodes in your cluster have an MTU of `9001`, and some have an MTU of `1500`, you must set this value to `1450`.

This value cannot be changed after cluster installation.
endif::operator[]
ifdef::operator[]
The maximum transmission unit (MTU) for the VXLAN overlay network. This value is normally configured automatically.
endif::operator[]

|`vxlanPort`
|`integer`
|
ifndef::operator[]
The port to use for all VXLAN packets. The default value is `4789`. This value cannot be changed after cluster installation.

If you are running in a virtualized environment with existing nodes that are part of another VXLAN network, then you might be required to change this. For example, when running an OpenShift SDN overlay on top of VMware NSX-T, you must select an alternate port for the VXLAN, because both SDNs use the same default VXLAN port number.

On Amazon Web Services (AWS), you can select an alternate port for the VXLAN between port `9000` and port `9999`.
endif::operator[]
ifdef::operator[]
The port to use for all VXLAN packets. The default value is `4789`.

[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6a",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`mtu`
|`integer`
|
ifndef::operator[]
The maximum transmission unit (MTU) for the Geneve (Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation) overlay network. This is detected automatically based on the MTU of the primary network interface. You do not normally need to override the detected MTU.

If the auto-detected value is not what you expect it to be, confirm that the MTU on the primary network interface on your nodes is correct. You cannot use this option to change the MTU value of the primary network interface on the nodes.

If your cluster requires different MTU values for different nodes, you must set this value to `100` less than the lowest MTU value in your cluster. For example, if some nodes in your cluster have an MTU of `9001`, and some have an MTU of `1500`, you must set this value to `1400`.
endif::operator[]
ifdef::operator[]
The maximum transmission unit (MTU) for the Geneve (Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation) overlay network. This value is normally configured automatically.
endif::operator[]

|`genevePort`
|`integer`
|
ifndef::operator[]
The port to use for all Geneve packets. The default value is `6081`. This value cannot be changed after cluster installation.
endif::operator[]
ifdef::operator[]
The UDP port for the Geneve overlay network.
endif::operator[]

|`ipsecConfig`
|`object`
|
ifndef::operator[]
Specify an empty object to enable IPsec encryption.
endif::operator[]
ifdef::operator[]
If the field is present, IPsec is enabled for the cluster.
endif::operator[]

|`policyAuditConfig`
|`object`
|Specify a configuration object for customizing network policy audit logging. If unset, the defaults audit log settings are used.

|`gatewayConfig`
|`object`
|Optional: Specify a configuration object for customizing how egress traffic is sent to the node gateway.

[NOTE]
====
 While migrating egress traffic, you can expect some disruption to workloads and service traffic until the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) successfully rolls out the changes.
====

|`v4InternalSubnet`
|
If your existing network infrastructure overlaps with the `100.64.0.0/16` IPv4 subnet, you can specify a different IP address range for internal use by OVN-Kubernetes. You must ensure that the IP address range does not overlap with any other subnet used by your {product-title} installation. The IP address range must be larger than the maximum number of nodes that can be added to the cluster. For example, if the `clusterNetwork.cidr` value is `10.128.0.0/14` and the `clusterNetwork.hostPrefix` value is `/23`, then the maximum number of nodes is `2^(23-14)=512`.

This field cannot be changed after installation.
|The default value is `100.64.0.0/16`.

|`v6InternalSubnet`
|
If your existing network infrastructure overlaps with the `fd98::/48` IPv6 subnet, you can specify a different IP address range for internal use by OVN-Kubernetes. You must ensure that the IP address range does not overlap with any other subnet used by your {product-title} installation. The IP address range must be larger than the maximum number of nodes that can be added to the cluster.

This field cannot be changed after installation.
| The default value is `fd98::/48`.

// tag::policy-audit[]
.`policyAuditConfig` object
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6a",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`rateLimit`
|integer
|The maximum number of messages to generate every second per node. The default value is `20` messages per second.

|`maxFileSize`
|integer
|The maximum size for the audit log in bytes. The default value is `50000000` or 50 MB.

|`destination`
|string
|
One of the following additional audit log targets:

`libc`:: The libc `syslog()` function of the journald process on the host.
`udp:<host>:<port>`:: A syslog server. Replace `<host>:<port>` with the host and port of the syslog server.
`unix:<file>`:: A Unix Domain Socket file specified by `<file>`.
`null`:: Do not send the audit logs to any additional target.

|`syslogFacility`
|string
|The syslog facility, such as `kern`, as defined by RFC5424. The default value is `local0`.

[id="gatewayConfig-object_{context}"]
.`gatewayConfig` object
[cols=".^2,.^2,.^6a",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`routingViaHost`
|`boolean`
|Set this field to `true` to send egress traffic from pods to the host networking stack.
For highly-specialized installations and applications that rely on manually configured routes in the kernel routing table, you might want to route egress traffic to the host networking stack.
By default, egress traffic is processed in OVN to exit the cluster and is not affected by specialized routes in the kernel routing table.
The default value is `false`.

This field has an interaction with the Open vSwitch hardware offloading feature.
If you set this field to `true`, you do not receive the performance benefits of the offloading because egress traffic is processed by the host networking stack.

|`ipForwarding`
|`object`
|You can control IP forwarding for all traffic on OVN-Kubernetes managed interfaces by using the `ipForwarding` specification in the `Network` resource. Specify `Restricted` to only allow IP forwarding for Kubernetes related traffic. Specify `Global` to allow forwarding of all IP traffic. For new installations, the default is `Restricted`. For updates to {product-title} 4.14, the default is `Global`.
