= About pod security admission

{product-title} includes link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission[Kubernetes pod security admission]. Pods that do not comply with the pod security admission defined globally or at the namespace level are not admitted to the cluster and cannot run.

Globally, the `privileged` profile is enforced, and the `restricted` profile is used for warnings and audits.

You can also configure the pod security admission settings at the namespace level.
