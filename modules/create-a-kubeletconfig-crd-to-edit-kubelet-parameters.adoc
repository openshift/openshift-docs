= Creating a KubeletConfig CRD to edit kubelet parameters

The kubelet configuration is currently serialized as an Ignition configuration, so it can be directly edited. However, there is also a new `kubelet-config-controller` added to the Machine Config Controller (MCC). This lets you use a `KubeletConfig` custom resource (CR) to edit the kubelet parameters.

[NOTE]
====
As the fields in the `kubeletConfig` object are passed directly to the kubelet from upstream Kubernetes, the kubelet validates those values directly. Invalid values in the `kubeletConfig` object might cause cluster nodes to become unavailable. For valid values, see the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1beta1/[Kubernetes documentation].
====

Consider the following guidance:

* Create one `KubeletConfig` CR for each machine config pool with all the config changes you want for that pool. If you are applying the same content to all of the pools, you need only one `KubeletConfig` CR for all of the pools.

* Edit an existing `KubeletConfig` CR to modify existing settings or add new settings, instead of creating a CR for each change. It is recommended that you create a CR only to modify a different machine config pool, or for changes that are intended to be temporary, so that you can revert the changes.

* As needed, create multiple `KubeletConfig` CRs with a limit of 10 per cluster. For the first `KubeletConfig` CR, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) creates a machine config appended with `kubelet`. With each subsequent CR, the controller creates another `kubelet` machine config with a numeric suffix. For example, if you have a `kubelet` machine config with a `-2` suffix, the next `kubelet` machine config is appended with `-3`.

If you want to delete the machine configs, delete them in reverse order to avoid exceeding the limit. For example, you delete the `kubelet-3` machine config before deleting the `kubelet-2` machine config.

[NOTE]
====
If you have a machine config with a `kubelet-9` suffix, and you create another `KubeletConfig` CR, a new machine config is not created, even if there are fewer than 10 `kubelet` machine configs.

The following procedure is an example to show how to configure the maximum number of pods per node on the worker nodes.

.Prerequisites

. Obtain the label associated with the static `MachineConfigPool` CR for the type of node you want to configure.
Perform one of the following steps:

.. View the machine config pool:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe machineconfigpool <name>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe machineconfigpool worker
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfigPool
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2019-02-08T14:52:39Z
  generation: 1
  labels:
    custom-kubelet: set-max-pods <1>
----
<1> If a label has been added it appears under `labels`.

.. If the label is not present, add a key/value pair:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label machineconfigpool worker custom-kubelet=set-max-pods
----

.Procedure

. View the available machine configuration objects that you can select:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machineconfig
----
+
By default, the two kubelet-related configs are `01-master-kubelet` and `01-worker-kubelet`.

. Check the current value for the maximum pods per node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe node <node_name>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe node ci-ln-5grqprb-f76d1-ncnqq-worker-a-mdv94
----
+
Look for `value: pods: <value>` in the `Allocatable` stanza:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Allocatable:
 attachable-volumes-aws-ebs:  25
 cpu:                         3500m
 hugepages-1Gi:               0
 hugepages-2Mi:               0
 memory:                      15341844Ki
 pods:                        250
----

. Set the maximum pods per node on the worker nodes by creating a custom resource file that contains the kubelet configuration:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Kubelet configurations that target a specific machine config pool also affect any dependent pools. For example, creating a kubelet configuration for the pool containing worker nodes will also apply to any subset pools, including the pool containing infrastructure nodes. To avoid this, you must create a new machine config pool with a selection expression that only includes worker nodes, and have your kubelet configuration target this new pool.

apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: KubeletConfig
metadata:
  name: set-max-pods
spec:
  machineConfigPoolSelector:
    matchLabels:
      custom-kubelet: set-max-pods <1>
  kubeletConfig:
    maxPods: 500 <2>
----
<1> Enter the label from the machine config pool.
<2> Add the kubelet configuration. In this example, use `maxPods` to set the maximum pods per node.
+
[NOTE]
====
The rate at which the kubelet talks to the API server depends on queries per second (QPS) and burst values. The default values, `50` for `kubeAPIQPS` and `100` for `kubeAPIBurst`, are sufficient if there are limited pods running on each node. It is recommended to update the kubelet QPS and burst rates if there are enough CPU and memory resources on the node.

    kubeAPIQPS: <QPS>
----
====
.. Update the machine config pool for workers with the label:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label machineconfigpool worker custom-kubelet=set-max-pods
----

.. Create the `KubeletConfig` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f change-maxPods-cr.yaml
----

.. Verify that the `KubeletConfig` object is created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get kubeletconfig
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                AGE
set-max-pods        15m
----
+
Depending on the number of worker nodes in the cluster, wait for the worker nodes to be rebooted one by one. For a cluster with 3 worker nodes, this could take about 10 to 15 minutes.

. Verify that the changes are applied to the node:

.. Check on a worker node that the `maxPods` value changed:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe node <node_name>
----

.. Locate the `Allocatable` stanza:
+
[source,terminal]
----
 ...
Allocatable:
  attachable-volumes-gce-pd:  127
  cpu:                        3500m
  ephemeral-storage:          123201474766
  hugepages-1Gi:              0
  hugepages-2Mi:              0
  memory:                     14225400Ki
  pods:                       500 <1>
 ...
----
<1> In this example, the `pods` parameter should report the value you set in the `KubeletConfig` object.

. Verify the change in the `KubeletConfig` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get kubeletconfigs set-max-pods -o yaml
----
+
This should show a status of `True` and `type:Success`, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  kubeletConfig:
    maxPods: 500
  machineConfigPoolSelector:
    matchLabels:
      custom-kubelet: set-max-pods
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2021-06-30T17:04:07Z"
    message: Success
    status: "True"
    type: Success
