[id="create-a-kubeletconfig-crd-to-edit-kubelet-parameters_{context}"]
= Create a KubeletConfig CRD to edit kubelet parameters

The kubelet configuration is currently serialized as an ignition configuration,
so it can be directly edited. However, there is also a new
kubelet-config-controller added to the Machine Config Controller (MCC). This
allows you to create a KubeletConfig custom resource (CR) to edit the
kubelet parameters.

.Procedure

. Run:
+
----
$ oc get machineconfig
----
+
This provides a list of the available machine configuration objects you can
select. By default, the two kubelet-related configs are `01-master-kubelet` and
`01-worker-kubelet`.

. To check the current value of max Pods per node, run:
+
----
# oc describe node <node-ip> | grep Allocatable -A6
----
+
Look for `value: pods: <value>`.
+
For example:
+
----
# oc describe node ip-172-31-128-158.us-east-2.compute.internal | grep Allocatable -A6
Allocatable:
 attachable-volumes-aws-ebs:  25
 cpu:                         3500m
 hugepages-1Gi:               0
 hugepages-2Mi:               0
 memory:                      15341844Ki
 pods:                        250
----

. To set the max Pods per node on the worker nodes, create a custom resource file
that contains the kubelet configuration. For example, `change-maxPods-cr.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: KubeletConfig
metadata:
  name: set-max-pods
spec:
  machineConfigPoolSelector:
    matchLabels:
      custom-kubelet: large-pods
  kubeletConfig:
    maxPods: 500
----
+
The rate at which the kubelet talks to the API server depends on queries per
second (QPS) and burst values. The default values, `5` for `kubeAPIQPS` and `10`
for `kubeAPIBurst`, are good enough if there are limited pods running on each
node. Updating the kubelet QPS and burst rates is recommended if there are
enough CPU and memory resources on the node:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: KubeletConfig
metadata:
  name: set-max-pods
spec:
  machineConfigPoolSelector:
    matchLabels:
      custom-kubelet: large-pods
  kubeletConfig:
    maxPods: <pod_count>
    kubeAPIBurst: <burst_rate>
    kubeAPIQPS: <QPS>
----
+
.. Run:
+
----
$ oc label machineconfigpool worker custom-kubelet=large-pods
----

.. Run:
+
----
$ oc create -f change-maxPods-cr.yaml
----

.. Run:
+
----
$ oc get kubeletconfig
----
+
This should return `set-max-pods`.
+
Depending on the number of worker nodes in the cluster, wait for the worker
nodes to be rebooted one by one. For a cluster with 3 worker nodes, this could
take about 10 to 15 minutes.

. Check for `maxPods` changing for the worker nodes:
+
----
$ oc describe node
----

.. Verify the change by running:
+
----
$ oc get kubeletconfigs set-max-pods -o yaml
----
+
This should show a status of `True` and `type:Success`

.Procedure

By default, only one machine is allowed to be unavailable when applying the
kubelet-related configuration to the available worker nodes. For a large
cluster, it can take a long time for the configuration change to be reflected.
At any time, you can adjust the number of machines that are updating to speed up
the process.

. Run:
+
----
$ oc edit machineconfigpool worker
----

. Set `maxUnavailable` to the desired value.
+
----
spec:
  maxUnavailable: <node_count>
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
When setting the value, consider the number of worker nodes that can be
unavailable without affecting the applications running on the cluster.
