== Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.10.1-267 release notes

This release of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.10.1-267 provides new features and bug fixes for running the Operator in an {product-title} cluster. The components of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.10.1-267 were released in link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2023:4089[RHBA-2023:4089].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before installing this version of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator, remove any previously installed Technology Preview versions or the community-supported version of KEDA.

Bug fixes::

* Previously, the `custom-metrics-autoscaler` and `custom-metrics-autoscaler-adapter` images did not contain time zone information. Because of this, scaled objects with cron triggers failed to work because the controllers were unable to find time zone information. With this fix, the image builds now include time zone information. As a result, scaled objects containing cron triggers now function properly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-15264[OCPBUGS-15264])

* Previously, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator would attempt to take ownership of all managed objects, including objects in other namespaces and cluster-scoped objects. Because of this, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator was unable to create the role binding for reading the credentials necessary to be an API server. This caused errors in the `kube-system` namespace. With this fix, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator skips adding the `ownerReference` field to any object in another namespace or any cluster-scoped object. As a result, the role binding is now created without any errors. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-15038[OCPBUGS-15038])

* Previously, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator added an `ownerReferences` field to the `openshift-keda` namespace. While this did not cause functionality problems, the presence of this field could have caused confusion for cluster administrators. With this fix, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator does not add the `ownerReference` field to the `openshift-keda` namespace. As a result, the `openshift-keda` namespace no longer has a superfluous `ownerReference` field. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-15293[OCPBUGS-15293])

* Previously, if you used a Prometheus trigger configured with authentication method other than pod identity, and the `podIdentity` parameter was set to `none`, the trigger would fail to scale. With this fix, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler for OpenShift now properly handles the `none` pod identity provider type. As a result, a Prometheus trigger configured with authentication method other than pod identity, and the `podIdentity` parameter sset to `none` now properly scales. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-15274[OCPBUGS-15274])

== Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.10.1 release notes

This release of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.10.1 provides new features and bug fixes for running the Operator in an {product-title} cluster.

New features and enhancements::

Note the new features and enhancements in this release:

* Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator general availability
+
The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator is now generally available as of Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator version 2.10.1.
+
--
:FeatureName: Scaling by using a scaled job
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]
--

* Performance metrics
+
You can now use the Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) to query metrics on the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator.

* Pausing the custom metrics autoscaling for scaled objects
+
You can now pause the autoscaling of a scaled object, as needed, and resume autoscaling when ready.

* Replica fall back for scaled objects
+
You can now specify the number of replicas to fall back to if a scaled object fails to get metrics from the source.

* Customizable HPA naming for scaled objects
+
You can now specify a custom name for the horizontal pod autoscaler in scaled objects.

* Activation and scaling thresholds
+
Because the horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) cannot scale to or from 0 replicas, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator does that scaling, after which the HPA performs the scaling. You can now specify when the  HPA takes over autoscaling, based on the number of replicas. This allows for more flexibility with your scaling policies.
