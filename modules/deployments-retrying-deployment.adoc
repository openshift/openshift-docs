= Retrying a deployment

If the current revision of your DeploymentConfig failed to deploy, you can
restart the deployment process.

.Procedure

. To restart a failed deployment process:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rollout retry dc/<name>
----
+
If the latest revision of it was deployed successfully, the command displays a
message and the deployment process is not be retried.
+
[NOTE]
====
Retrying a deployment restarts the deployment process and does not create a new
deployment revision. The restarted ReplicationController has the same
configuration it had when it failed.
