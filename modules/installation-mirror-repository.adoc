= Mirroring the {product-title} image repository

Mirror the {product-title} image repository to your registry to use during cluster installation or upgrade.

.Prerequisites

* Your mirror host has access to the internet.
* You configured a mirror registry to use in your restricted network and
can access the certificate and credentials that you configured.
ifndef::openshift-origin[]
* You downloaded the pull secret from the
link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Pull Secret] page on the {cloud-redhat-com} site and modified it to include authentication to your mirror repository.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
* You have created a pull secret for your mirror repository.
endif::[]

* If you use self-signed certificates that do not set a Subject Alternative Name, you must precede the `oc` commands in this procedure with `GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0`. If you do not set this variable, the `oc` commands will fail with the following error:
+
[source,terminal]
----
x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field, use SANs or temporarily enable Common Name matching with GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0
----

.Procedure

Complete the following steps on the mirror host:

[NOTE]
====
Optionally, you can use image tag name instead of image digest in the following commands.
====

. Review the
link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[{product-title} downloads page]
to determine the version of {product-title} that you want to install.
The image release advisory includes the pullspec repository and digest.

. Set the required environment variables:
.. Export the image repository from the image release advisory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ OCP_RELEASE_REPOSITORY=quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release
----

.. Export the release digest from the image release advisory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ OCP_RELEASE_DIGEST=<release_digest>
----
+
For `<release_digest>`, specify the digest from the release image advisory, such as
`sha256:4d048ae1274d11c49f9b7e70713a072315431598b2ddbb512aee4027c422fe3e`.
+
If you want to inspect a particular release image, use `oc adm release info "${OCP_RELEASE_REPOSITORY}@${OCP_RELEASE_DIGEST}`.

.. Export the local registry name and host port:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ LOCAL_REGISTRY='<local_registry_host_name>:<local_registry_host_port>'
----
+
For `<local_registry_host_name>`, specify the registry domain name for your mirror
repository, and for `<local_registry_host_port>`, specify the port that it
serves content on.

.. Export the local repository name:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ LOCAL_REPOSITORY='<local_repository_name>'
----
+
For `<local_repository_name>`, specify the name of the repository to create in your
registry, such as `ocp4/openshift4`.

.. Export a tag name for the mirrored release image:
+
ifndef::openshift-origin[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ LOCAL_TAG=<local_tag>
----
+
For `<local_tag>`, you may specify any tag name compatible with your local registry.
To avoid conflicts, a safe pattern includes both the version of {product-title} to
install, and the architecture for the release image, such as `x86_64`.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ PRODUCT_REPO='openshift'
----
endif::[]

.. Export the path to your registry pull secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ LOCAL_SECRET_JSON='<path_to_pull_secret>'
----
+
For `<path_to_pull_secret>`, specify the absolute path to and file name of the pull secret for your mirror registry that you created.

.. Export the path to the directory to host the mirrored images:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH=<path> <1>
----
<1> Specify the full path, including the initial forward slash (/) character.

. Mirror the version images to the internal container registry:
** If your mirror host does not have internet access, take the following actions:
... Connect the removable media to a system that is connected to the internet.
... Review the images and configuration manifests to mirror:
+
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON}  \
     --from=quay.io/${PRODUCT_REPO}/${RELEASE_NAME}:${OCP_RELEASE} \
     --to=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY} \
     --to-release-image=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}:${OCP_RELEASE} --dry-run
----
endif::[]
ifndef::openshift-origin[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON}  \
     --from=${OCP_RELEASE_REPOSITORY}@${OCP_RELEASE_DIGEST} \
     --to=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY} \
     --to-release-image=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}:${LOCAL_TAG} --dry-run
----
endif::[]

... Record the entire `imageContentSources` section from the output of the previous
command. The information about your mirrors is unique to your mirrored repository, and you must add the `imageContentSources` section to the `install-config.yaml` file during installation.
... Mirror the images to a directory on the removable media:
+
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} --to-dir=${REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH}/mirror ${OCP_RELEASE_REPOSITORY}@${OCP_RELEASE_DIGEST}
----
endif::[]
ifndef::openshift-origin[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} --to-dir=${REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH}/mirror ${OCP_RELEASE_REPOSITORY}@${OCP_RELEASE_DIGEST}
----
endif::[]

... Take the media to the restricted network environment and upload the images to the local container registry.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc image mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} --from-dir=${REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH}/mirror "file://openshift/release:${OCP_RELEASE}*" ${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY} <1>
----
+
<1> For `REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH`, you must use the same path that you specified when you mirrored the images.

** If the local container registry is connected to the mirror host, take the following actions:
... Directly push the release images to the local registry by using following command:
+
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON}  \
     --from=${OCP_RELEASE_REPOSITORY}@${OCP_RELEASE_DIGEST} \
     --to=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY} \
     --to-release-image=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}:${LOCAL_TAG}
----
endif::[]
ifndef::openshift-origin[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON}  \
     --from=${OCP_RELEASE_REPOSITORY}@${OCP_RELEASE_DIGEST} \
     --to=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY} \
     --to-release-image=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}:${LOCAL_TAG}
----
endif::[]
+
This command pulls the release information as a digest, and its output includes
the `imageContentSources` data that you require when you install your cluster.

... Record the entire `imageContentSources` section from the output of the previous
command. The information about your mirrors is unique to your mirrored repository, and you must add the `imageContentSources` section to the `install-config.yaml` file during installation.
+
[NOTE]
====
The image name gets patched to Quay.io during the mirroring process, and the podman images will show Quay.io in the registry on the bootstrap virtual machine.
====

. To create the installation program that is based on the content that you
mirrored, extract it and pin it to the release:
** If your mirror host does not have internet access, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release extract -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} --command=openshift-install "${OCP_RELEASE_REPOSITORY}@${OCP_RELEASE_DIGEST}"
----
** If the local container registry is connected to the mirror host, run the following command:
+
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release extract -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} --command=openshift-install "${OCP_RELEASE_REPOSITORY}@${OCP_RELEASE_DIGEST}"
----
endif::[]
ifndef::openshift-origin[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release extract -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} --command=openshift-install "${OCP_RELEASE_REPOSITORY}@${OCP_RELEASE_DIGEST}"
----
endif::[]
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To ensure that you use the correct images for the version of {product-title}
that you selected, you must extract the installation program from the mirrored
content.

You must perform this step on a machine with an active internet connection.

If you are in a disconnected environment, use the `--image` flag as part of must-gather and point to the payload image.
====
+
. For clusters using installer-provisioned infrastructure, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openshift-install
