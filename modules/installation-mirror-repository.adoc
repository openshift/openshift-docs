[id="installation-mirror-repository_{context}"]
= Mirroring the {product-title} image repository

Mirror the {product-title} image repository to use during cluster installation
or upgrade.

.Prerequisites

* You configured a mirror registry to use in your restricted network and
can access the certificate and credentials that you configured.
* You downloaded the pull secret from the
link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install[OpenShift Infrastructure Providers]
page and modified it to include authentication to your mirror repository.

.Procedure

Complete the following steps on the bastion host:

. Review the
link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[{product-title} downloads page]
to determine the version of {product-title} that you want to install.

. Set the required environment variables:
+
----
$ export OCP_RELEASE=<release_version> <1>
$ export LOCAL_REGISTRY='<local_registry_host_name>:<local_registry_host_port>' <2>
$ export LOCAL_REPOSITORY='<repository_name>' <3>
$ export PRODUCT_REPO='openshift-release-dev' <4>
$ export LOCAL_SECRET_JSON='<path_to_pull_secret>' <5>
$ export RELEASE_NAME="ocp-release" <6>
----
<1> For `<release_version>`, specify the version number of {product-title} to
install, such as `4.2.0`.
<2> For `<local_registry_host_name>`, specify the registry domain name for your mirror
repository, and for `<local_registry_host_port>`, specify the port that it
serves content on.
<3> For `<repository_name>`, specify the name of the repository to create in your
registry, such as `ocp4/openshift4`.
<4> The repository to mirror. For a production release, you must specify
`openshift-release-dev`.
<5> For `<path_to_pull_secret>`, specify the absolute path to and file name of
the pull secret for your mirror registry that you created.
<6> The release mirror. For a production release, you must specify
`ocp-release`.

. Mirror the repository:
+
----
$ oc adm -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} release mirror \
     --from=quay.io/${PRODUCT_REPO}/${RELEASE_NAME}:${OCP_RELEASE} \
     --to=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY} \
     --to-release-image=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}:${OCP_RELEASE}
----
+
This command pulls the release information as a digest, and its output includes
text that resembles the following sample:
+
----
...
Success
Update image:  <local_registry_host_name>:<local_registry_host_port>/<local_registry>/<local_repository>:<release_version>
Mirror prefix: <local_registry_host_name>:<local_registry_host_port>/<local_registry>/<local_repository>

To use the new mirrored repository to install, add the following section to the install-config.yaml:

imageContentSources:
- mirrors:
  - <local_registry_host_name>:<local_registry_host_port>/<repository_name>/release
  source: <upstream_repository>
...
----

. Record the `imageContentSources` section from the output of the previous
command. This information is required during {product-title} installation.

. To create the installation program that is based on the content that you
mirrored, extract it and pin it to the release:
+
----
$ oc adm release extract --command=openshift-install "${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}:${OCP_RELEASE}"
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To ensure that you use the correct images for the version of {product-title}
that you selected, you must extract the installation program from the mirrored
content.
