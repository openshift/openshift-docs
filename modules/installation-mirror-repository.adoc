= Mirroring the {product-title} image repository

Mirror the {product-title} image repository to your registry to use during cluster installation or upgrade.

.Prerequisites

* Your mirror host has access to the internet.
* You configured a mirror registry to use in your restricted network and
can access the certificate and credentials that you configured.
ifndef::openshift-origin[]
* You downloaded the pull secret from the
link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Pull Secret] page on the {cloud-redhat-com} site and modified it to include authentication to your mirror repository.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
* You have created a pull secret for your mirror repository.
endif::[]

.Procedure

Complete the following steps on the mirror host:

. Review the
link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[{product-title} downloads page]
to determine the version of {product-title} that you want to install.
The image release advisory includes the pullspec repository and digest. For example, link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/product/290/ver=4.5/rhel---8/x86_64/RHBA-2020:3719[the 4.5.11 Bug Fix Advisory] uses `quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release` for the pullspec repository and  `sha256:4d048ae1274d11c49f9b7e70713a072315431598b2ddbb512aee4027c422fe3e` for the x86-64 4.5.11 release image digest.

. Set the required environment variables:
.. Export the image repository from the image release advisory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ OCP_RELEASE_REPOSITORY=quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release
----

.. Export the release digest from the image release advisory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ OCP_RELEASE_DIGEST=<release_digest>
----
+
For `<release_digest>`, specify the digest from the release image advisory, such as
`sha256:4d048ae1274d11c49f9b7e70713a072315431598b2ddbb512aee4027c422fe3e`.
+
If you want to inspect a particular release image, use `oc adm release info "${OCP_RELEASE_REPOSITORY}@${OCP_RELEASE_DIGEST}`.

.. Export the local registry name and host port:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ LOCAL_REGISTRY='<local_registry_host_name>:<local_registry_host_port>'
----
+
For `<local_registry_host_name>`, specify the registry domain name for your mirror
repository, and for `<local_registry_host_port>`, specify the port that it
serves content on.

.. Export the local repository name:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ LOCAL_REPOSITORY='<local_repository_name>'
----
+
For `<local_repository_name>`, specify the name of the repository to create in your
registry, such as `ocp4/openshift4`.

.. Export a tag name for the mirrored release image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ LOCAL_TAG=<local_tag>
----
+
For `<local_tag>`, you may specify any tag name compatible with your local registry.
To avoid conflicts, a safe pattern includes both the version of {product-title} to
install, such as `4.5.11`, and the architecture for the release image, such as `x86_64`.

.. Export the path to your registry pull secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ LOCAL_SECRET_JSON='<path_to_pull_secret>'
----
+
For `<path_to_pull_secret>`, specify the absolute path to and file name of the pull secret for your mirror registry that you created.

.. Export the path to the directory to host the mirrored images:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH=<path>
----

. Mirror the version images to the internal container registry:
** If your mirror host does not have internet access, take the following actions:
... Connect the removable media to a system that is connected to the internet.
... Review the images and configuration manifests to mirror:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} release mirror \
     --from=${OCP_RELEASE_REPOSITORY}@${OCP_RELEASE_DIGEST} \
     --to=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY} \
     --to-release-image=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}:${LOCAL_TAG} --dry-run
----
... Record the entire `imageContentSources` section from the output of the previous
command. The information about your mirrors is unique to your mirrored repository, and you must add the `imageContentSources` section to the `install-config.yaml` file during installation.
... Mirror the images to a directory on the removable media:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} --to-dir=${REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH}/mirror ${OCP_RELEASE_REPOSITORY}@${OCP_RELEASE_DIGEST}
----
... Take the media to the restricted network environment and upload the images to the local container registry.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc image mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} --from-dir=${REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH}/mirror "file://openshift/release:4.*" ${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}
----

** If the local container registry is connected to the mirror host, take the following actions:
... Directly push the release images to the local registry by using following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} release mirror \
     --from=${OCP_RELEASE_REPOSITORY}@${OCP_RELEASE_DIGEST} \
     --to=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY} \
     --to-release-image=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}:${LOCAL_TAG}
----
+
This command pulls the release information as a digest, and its output includes
the `imageContentSources` data that you require when you install your cluster.

... Record the entire `imageContentSources` section from the output of the previous
command. The information about your mirrors is unique to your mirrored repository, and you must add the `imageContentSources` section to the `install-config.yaml` file during installation.

. To create the installation program that is based on the content that you
mirrored, extract it and pin it to the release:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} release extract --command=openshift-install "${OCP_RELEASE_REPOSITORY}@${OCP_RELEASE_DIGEST}"
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To ensure that you use the correct images for the version of {product-title}
that you selected, you must extract the installation program from the mirrored
content.

You must perform this step on a machine with an active internet connection.
