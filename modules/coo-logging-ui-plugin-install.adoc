[NOTE]
====
These are the known issues for the logging UI plugin - for more information, see link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OU-587[OU-587].

* The `schema` feature is only supported in {product-title} 4.15 and later. In earlier versions of {product-title}, the logging UI plugin will only use the `viaq` attribute, ignoring any other values that might be set.

* Non-administrator users cannot query logs using the `otel` attribute with {logging} {for} versions 5.8 to 6.2. This issue will be fixed in a future {logging} release. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6589[LOG-6589])

* In {logging} {for} version 5.9, the `severity_text` Otel attribute is not set.
