= Creating a persistent volume on RHV

When you create a `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC) object, {product-title} provisions a new persistent volume (PV) and creates a `PersistentVolume` object.

.Prerequisites
* You are logged in to a running {product-title} cluster.
* You provided the correct {rh-virtualization} credentials in  `ovirt-credentials` secret.
* You have installed the oVirt CSI driver.
* You have defined at least one storage class.

.Procedure

* If you are using the web console to dynamically create a persistent volume on {rh-virtualization}:
+
. In the {product-title} console, click *Storage* -> *Persistent Volume Claims*.
. In the persistent volume claims overview, click *Create Persistent Volume Claim*.
. Define the required options on the resulting page.
. Select the appropriate `StorageClass` object, which is `ovirt-csi-sc` by default.
. Enter a unique name for the storage claim.
. Select the access mode. Currently, RWO (ReadWriteOnce) is the only supported access mode.
. Define the size of the storage claim.
. Select the Volume Mode:
+
`Filesystem`: Mounted into pods as a directory. This mode is the default.
+
`Block`: Block device, without any file system on it
+
. Click *Create* to create the `PersistentVolumeClaim` object and generate a `PersistentVolume` object.

* If you are using the command-line interface (CLI) to dynamically create a {rh-virtualization} CSI volume:
+
. Create and save a file with the `PersistentVolumeClaim` object described by the following sample YAML:
+
.pvc-ovirt.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc-ovirt
spec:
  storageClassName: ovirt-csi-sc <1>
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: <volume size>  <2>
  volumeMode: <volume mode> <3>
----
<1> Name of the required storage class.
<2> Volume size in GiB.
<3> Supported options:
    ** `Filesystem`: Mounted into pods as a directory. This mode is the default.
    ** `Block`: Block device, without any file system on it.
+
. Create the object you saved in the previous step by running the following command:
+
----
$ oc create -f pvc-ovirt.yaml
----
+
. To verify that the volume was created and is ready, run the following command:
+
----
$ oc get pvc pvc-ovirt
----
+
The `pvc-ovirt` shows that it is Bound.
