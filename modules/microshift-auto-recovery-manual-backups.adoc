= Modifying backup and restore commands to automate data recovery

Use automatic recovery options to store all of your backups in a single directory, then automatically select the latest one to restore. Modifying existing `backup` and `restore` commands enables you to set up automatic recovery.

The `--auto-recovery` option treats the `PATH` argument as a path to a directory that holds all the backups for automated recovery, and not just as a path to a particular backup file. You can use the `--auto-recovery` option with both `backup` and `restore` commands.

* For example, if you use the automatic recovery option with `restore`, such as in `microshift restore --auto-recovery PATH`, running the modified command automatically selects and restores the most recent backup.

* If you use the same option in the `microshift backup` command, such as in `microshift backup --auto-recovery PATH`, a new backup is created in the PATH.

* By default, `microshift restore --auto-recovery PATH` creates a backup of the failed {microshift-short} data in `PATH/failed`. You can add the `--dont-save-failed` option to disable the creation of failed backup data.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can only use the `--dont-save-failed` option with the `restore` command.
