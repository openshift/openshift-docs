= Sample OpenID Connect CRs

The following Custom Resources (CRs) show the parameters and acceptable values for an
OpenID Connect identity provider.

If you must specify a custom certificate bundle, extra scopes, extra authorization request
parameters, or a `userInfo` URL, use the full OpenID Connect CR.

.Standard OpenID Connect CR

----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: OAuth
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  identityProviders:
  - name: oidcidp <1>
    mappingMethod: claim <2>
    type: OpenID
    openID:
      clientID: ... <3>

----
<1> This provider name is prefixed to the value of the identity claim to form an
identity name. It is also used to build the redirect URL.
<2> Controls how mappings are established between this provider's identities and user objects.
<3> The client ID of a client registered with the OpenID provider. The
client must be allowed to redirect to
`\https://oauth-openshift.apps.<cluster_name>.<cluster_domain>/oauth2callback/<idp_provider_name>`.
<4> Reference to an {product-title} Secret containing the client secret.
<5> List of claims to use as the identity. First non-empty claim is used. At
least one claim is required. If none of the listed claims have a value,
authentication fails. For example, this uses the value of the `sub` claim in the returned `id_token` as the user's identity.
<6> link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IssuerIdentifier[Issuer Identifier]
described in the OpenID spec. Must use `https` without query or fragment
component.
