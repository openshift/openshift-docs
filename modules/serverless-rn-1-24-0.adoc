[id="fixed-issues-1.24.0_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

* Integrating {ServerlessProductName} with {SMProductName} causes the `net-istio-controller` pod to run out of memory on startup when too many secrets are present on the cluster.
+
It is now possible to enable secret filtering, which causes `net-istio-controller` to consider only secrets with a `networking.internal.knative.dev/certificate-uid` label, thus reducing the amount of memory needed.

* The {FunctionsProductName} Technology Preview now uses link:https://buildpacks.io/[Cloud Native Buildpacks] by default to build container images.

[id="known-issues-1-24-0_{context}"]
== Known issues

* The Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) mode is disabled for Kafka broker, Kafka source, and Kafka sink.

* In {ServerlessProductName} 1.23, support for KafkaBindings and the `kafka-binding` webhook were removed. However, an existing `kafkabindings.webhook.kafka.sources.knative.dev MutatingWebhookConfiguration` might remain, pointing to the `kafka-source-webhook` service, which no longer exists.
+
For certain specifications of KafkaBindings on the cluster, `kafkabindings.webhook.kafka.sources.knative.dev MutatingWebhookConfiguration` might be configured to pass any create and update events to various resources, such as Deployments, Knative Services, or Jobs, through the webhook, which would then fail.
+
To work around this issue, manually delete `kafkabindings.webhook.kafka.sources.knative.dev MutatingWebhookConfiguration` from the cluster after upgrading to {ServerlessProductName} 1.23:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete mutatingwebhookconfiguration kafkabindings.webhook.kafka.sources.knative.dev
----

* If you use `net-istio` for Ingress and enable mTLS via SMCP using `security.dataPlane.mtls: true`, Service Mesh deploys `DestinationRules` for the `*.local` host, which does not allow `DomainMapping` for {ServerlessProductName}.
+
To work around this issue, enable mTLS by deploying `PeerAuthentication` instead of using `security.dataPlane.mtls: true`.
