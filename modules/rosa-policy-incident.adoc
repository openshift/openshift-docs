= Incident and operations management


This documentation details the Red Hat responsibilities for the {product-title} (ROSA) managed service.

[id="rosa-policy-platform-monitoring_{context}"]
== Platform monitoring
Red Hat site reliability engineers (SREs) maintain a centralized monitoring and alerting system for all ROSA cluster components, the SRE services, and underlying AWS accounts. Platform audit logs are securely forwarded to a centralized security information and event monitoring (SIEM) system, where they may trigger configured alerts to the SRE team and are also subject to manual review. Audit logs are retained in the SIEM system for one year. Audit logs for a given cluster are not deleted at the time the cluster is deleted.

[id="rosa-policy-incident-management_{context}"]
== Incident management
An incident is an event that results in a degradation or outage of one or more Red Hat services. An incident can be raised by a customer or a Customer Experience and Engagement (CEE) member through a support case, directly by the centralized monitoring and alerting system, or directly by a member of the SRE team.

Depending on the impact on the service and customer, the incident is categorized in terms of link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/production/sla[severity].

When managing a new incident, Red Hat uses the following general workflow:

. An SRE first responder is alerted to a new incident and begins an initial investigation.
. After the initial investigation, the incident is assigned an incident lead, who coordinates the recovery efforts.
. An incident lead manages all communication and coordination around recovery, including any relevant notifications and support case updates.
. The incident is recovered.
. The incident is documented and a root cause analysis (RCA) is performed within 5 business days of the incident.
. An RCA draft document will be shared with the customer within 7 business days of the incident.

[id="rosa-policy-notifications_{context}"]
== Notifications
Platform notifications are configured using email. Some customer notifications are also sent to an account's corresponding Red Hat account team, including a Technical Account Manager, if applicable.

The following activities can trigger notifications:

- Platform incident
- Performance degradation
- Cluster capacity warnings
- Critical vulnerabilities and resolution
- Upgrade scheduling

[id="rosa-policy-backup-recovery-sts_{context}"]
== Backup and recovery for ROSA clusters with STS

There is no backup method available for ROSA clusters with STS.

[id="backup-recovery_{context}"]
== Backup and recovery
All Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS cluster metadata from OpenShift Cluster Manager is securely backed up by Red Hat. The following table outlines backup and recovery strategies:

//Verify if the corresponding tables in rosa-sdpolicy-platform.adoc and policy-incident.adoc also need to be updated.

|===

* Red Hat does not commit to any Recovery Point Objective (RPO) or Recovery Time Objective (RTO).
* Customers are responsible for taking regular backups of their data
* Customers should deploy multi-AZ clusters with workloads that follow Kubernetes best practices to ensure high availability within a region.
* If an entire cloud region is unavailable, customers must install a new cluster in a different region and restore their apps using their backup data.

[id="rosa-policy-cluster-capacity_{context}"]
== Cluster capacity
Evaluating and managing cluster capacity is a responsibility that is shared between Red Hat and the customer. Red Hat SRE is responsible for the capacity of all control plane and infrastructure nodes on the cluster.

Red Hat SRE also evaluates cluster capacity during upgrades and in response to cluster alerts. The impact of a cluster upgrade on capacity is evaluated as part of the upgrade testing process to ensure that capacity is not negatively impacted by new additions to the cluster. During a cluster upgrade, additional worker nodes are added to make sure that total cluster capacity is maintained during the upgrade process.

Capacity evaluations by the Red Hat SRE staff also happen in response to alerts from the cluster, after usage thresholds are exceeded for a certain period of time. Such alerts can also result in a notification to the customer.
