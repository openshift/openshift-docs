[IMPORTANT]
====
[subs="attributes+"]
OpenShift Cluster Manager API command-line interface (`ocm`) is a Developer Preview feature only.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Developer Preview features, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/devpreview/[Developer Preview Support Scope].
====
+
// To use the OCM CLI, you must authenticate against your Red Hat {cluster-manager} account. This is accomplished with the {cluster-manager} API token.
// +
// You can obtain your token link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token/show[here].

. To authenticate against your Red Hat {cluster-manager} account, run one of the following commands.

.. If your system supports a web-based browser, run the Red{nbsp}Hat single sign-on (SSO) authorization code command for secure authentication:
+
.Syntax
[source,terminal]
----
$ ocm login --use-auth-code
----
+
Running this command will redirect you to the Red Hat SSO login. Log in with your Red{nbsp}Hat login or email.
+
.. If you are working with containers, remote hosts, and other environments without a web browser, run the Red{nbsp}Hat single sign-on (SSO) device code command for secure authentication:

+
.Syntax
[source,terminal]
----
$ ocm login --use-device-code
----
Running this command will redirect you to the Red{nbsp}Hat SSO login and provide a log in code.

+

To switch accounts, logout from https://sso.redhat.com and run the `ocm logout` command in your terminal before attempting to login again.
