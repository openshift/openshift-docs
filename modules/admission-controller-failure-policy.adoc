= Configuring the admission controller failure policy during installation

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure the admission controller failure policy when you install a cluster. This setting determines whether the API server request is allowed (fail open) or blocked (fail closed) if an error or timeout happens in the {product-title-short} validating webhook evaluation. 

. When installing a cluster by using the Operator, Helm, or `roxctl` CLI methods, follow the instructions in "Installing Secured Cluster services for {product-title-short} on Red Hat OpenShift" and "Installing Secured Cluster services for {product-title-short} on other platforms" to configure this parameter during installation.
. When installing a cluster by using the legacy installation method, follow these steps:
.. In the {product-title-short} portal, select *Platform Configuration* -> *Clusters*.
.. Select an existing cluster from the list. 
.. In the *Static configuration (requires deployment)* section, in the *Admission controller failure policy* field, select one of the following options:
* *Fail open*: If an error or timeout occurs when a workload admission or update request is being evaluated by the validating webhook, the request should be allowed to reach the API server.
* *Fail closed*: If an error or timeout occurs when a workload admission or update request is being evaluated by the validating webhook, the request should not be allowed to reach the API server, but should be blocked.
.. Select *Next*.
.. Select *Finish*. Because this is a change to the static configuration, you must redeploy the cluster for your changes to take effect.
