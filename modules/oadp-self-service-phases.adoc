= {oadp-short} Self-Service backup and restore phases

The `status.phase` field of a `NonAdminBackup` (NAB) CR and a `NonAdminRestore` (NAR) CR provide an overview of the current state of the CRs. Review the values for the NAB and NAR phases in the following table.

The phase of the CRs only progress forward. Once a phase transitions to the next phase, it cannot revert to a previous phase.

.Phases
|===
|*Value* |*Description*
|New|A creation request of the NAB or NAR CR is accepted by the NAC, but it has not yet been validated by the NAC.
|BackingOff|NAB or NAR CR is invalidated by the NAC CR because of an invalid `spec` of the NAB or NAR  CR. 

The namespace admin user can update the NAB or NAR `spec` to comply with the policies set by the administrator. After the namespace admin user edits the CRs, the NAC reconciles the CR again.
|Created|NAB or NAR CR is validated by the NAC, and the `Velero` backup or restore object is created.
|Deletion|NAB or NAR CR is marked for deletion. The NAC deletes the corresponding `Velero` backup or restore object. When the `Velero` object is deleted, the NAB or NAR CR is also deleted.
