= Step resources definition

You can include a definition of resources, such as the limit imposed on CPU, memory, and disk usage for all steps in a build strategy. For strategies with multiple steps, a step might require more resources than others. As a strategy administrator, you can define the resource values that are optimal for each step.

For example, you can install strategies with the same steps, but different names and step resources on the cluster so that users can create a build with smaller or larger resource requirements.
