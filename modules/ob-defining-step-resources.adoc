= Step resources definition

[role="_abstract"]
Define resource requirements, such as limits on CPU, memory, and disk usage, for all steps in a build strategy. For strategies with multiple steps, individual steps might require different resource allocations. As a strategy administrator, you can specify optimal resource values for each step.

For example, you can install strategies with identical steps but different names and step-level resource settings on the cluster, allowing users to create builds with smaller or larger resource requirements as needed.
