= {ols-long} version 0.3.5

{ols-official} 0.3.5 is now available on {ocp-product-title} 4.15 and later.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{ols-official} is designed for Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). When running on {ocp-product-title} in FIPS mode, it uses the {rhel} cryptographic libraries submitted (or planned to be submitted) to NIST for FIPS validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390X` architectures. For more information about the NIST validation program, see link:https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules[Cryptographic Module Validation Program]. For the latest NIST status of the individual versions of {rhel} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted for validation, see link:https://access.redhat.com/en/compliance[Product compliance].

== Enhancements

The following enhancements are made with {ols-official} 0.3.5:

* Beginning in this release, the {ols-long} conversation history is saved to the PostgresSQL database and is retained in persistent volume. The conversation history persists if the PostgreSQL pod restarts or is rescheduled. PostgresSQL persistence is disabled by default. To enable the feature, define the `size` and `class` parameters in the `ols.storage` specification of the `OLSConfig` custom resource (CR).

* This release introduces the cluster interaction feature as a Technology Preview feature. Use the cluster interaction feature to enhance the knowledge available to the large language model (LLM) with information about an {ocp-product-title} cluster. Providing cluster-specific information, such as the namespaces or pods that the cluster contains, enables the LLM to generate responses unique to the cluster.
