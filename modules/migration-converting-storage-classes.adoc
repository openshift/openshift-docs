= Converting storage classes in the {mtc-short} web console

You can convert the storage class of a persistent volume (PV) by migrating it within the same cluster. To do so, you must create and run a migration plan in the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) web console.

.Prerequisites

* You must be logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges on the cluster on which {mtc-short} is running.
* You must add the cluster to the {mtc-short} web console.

.Procedure

. In the left-side navigation pane of the {product-title} web console, click *Projects*.
. In the list of projects, click your project.
+
The *Project details* page opens.
. Click the *DeploymentConfig* name. Note the name of its running pod.
. Open the YAML tab of the project. Find the PVs and note the names of their corresponding persistent volume claims (PVCs).
. In the {mtc-short} web console, click *Migration plans*.
. Click *Add migration plan*.
. Enter the *Plan name*.
+
The migration plan name must contain 3 to 63 lower-case alphanumeric characters (`a-z, 0-9`) and must not contain spaces or underscores (`_`).

. From the *Migration type* menu, select *Storage class conversion*.
. From the *Source cluster* list, select the desired cluster for storage class conversion.
. Click *Next*.
+
The *Namespaces* page opens.
. Select the required project.
. Click *Next*.
+
The *Persistent volumes* page opens. The page displays the PVs in the project, all selected by default.
. For each PV, select the desired target storage class.
. Click *Next*.
+
The wizard validates the new migration plan and shows that it is ready.
. Click *Close*.
+
The new plan appears on the *Migration plans* page.
. To start the conversion, click the options menu of the new plan.
+
Under *Migrations*, two options are displayed, *Stage* and *Cutover*.
+
[NOTE]
=====
Cutover migration updates PVC references in the applications.

Stage migration does not update PVC references in the applications.
=====
. Select the desired option.
+
Depending on which option you selected, the *Stage migration* or *Cutover migration* notification appears.
. Click *Migrate*.
+
Depending on which option you selected, the *Stage started* or *Cutover started* message appears.
.  To see the status of the current migration, click the number in the *Migrations* column.
+
The *Migrations* page opens.
. To see more details on the current migration and monitor its progress, select the migration from the *Type* column.
+
The *Migration details* page opens.
When the migration progresses to the DirectVolume step and the status of the step becomes `Running Rsync Pods to migrate Persistent Volume data`, you can click *View details* and see the detailed status of the copies.
. In the breadcrumb bar, click *Stage* or *Cutover* and wait for all steps to complete.
. Open the *PersistentVolumeClaims* tab of the {product-title} web console.
+
You can see new PVCs with the names of the initial PVCs but ending in `new`, which are using the target storage class.
. In the left-side navigation pane, click *Pods*. See that the pod of your project is running again.
