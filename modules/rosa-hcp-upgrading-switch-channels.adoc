= Switch channels to view available upgrade options

[role="_abstract"]
You can switch the channel options on a {product-title} cluster to access the preferred upgrade options within a minor version (y-stream), or to upgrade to the next minor version (y+1). The version number in the channel represents the target minor version that the cluster will eventually be updated to.

For example, if you're currently on stable-4.16, 4.17 update channels do not recommend updates to 4.18 or later releases. This strategy ensures that administrators must explicitly decide to update to the next minor version of {product-title}.

.Procedure

. Log in to {cluster-manager-url}.
. Select a cluster to upgrade.
. Click Administration > Cluster Settings. 
. In Cluster Settings, click the *Details* tab.
. In the *Channel* pane, switch the channel setting from Channel_group to Channel.
. Next, select the Channel.
.. Click the edit channel icon.
.. On the Input channel dialog, enter the required channel version, for example, stable-4.18.
.. Click *Save*.
** The upgrade options for your selected Channel will be displayed in the Available Upgrades list.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Channel_groups option is being deprecated. You can still switch between channel groups, such as stable and eus, but channel updates that include the minor version take precedence.
