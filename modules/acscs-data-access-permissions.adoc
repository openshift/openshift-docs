Red Hat does not have access to any clusters on which you install the secured cluster services. Additionally, {product-title-managed-short} does not require permission to access the secured clusters. For example, you do not need to create new IAM policies, access roles, or API tokens.

However, {product-title-managed-short} stores the data that secured cluster services send. All data is encrypted within the {product-title-managed-short}. The encryption of data within the {product-title-managed-short} platform helps to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data.

When you install secured cluster services on a cluster, it generates data and transmits it to the {product-title-managed-short}. This data is kept secure within the {product-title-managed-short} platform, and only authorized SRE team members and systems can access this data. {product-title-managed-short} uses this data to help monitor the security and compliance of your cluster and applications and provide valuable insights and analytics that can help you optimize your deployments.
