= Requirements for installing OpenShift on a single node

Installing {product-title} on a single node alleviates some of the requirements for high availability and large scale clusters. However, you must address the following requirements:

* *Administration host:* You must have a computer to prepare the ISO, to create the USB boot drive, and to monitor the installation.
+
[NOTE]
====
For the `ppc64le` platform, the host should prepare the ISO, but does not need to create the USB boot drive. The ISO can be mounted to PowerVM directly.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
ISO is not required for {ibm-z-name} installations.
====

* *CPU Architecture:* Installing {product-title} on a single node supports `x86_64`, `arm64`,`ppc64le`, and `s390x` CPU architectures.

* *Supported platforms:*
Installing {product-title} on a single node is supported on bare metal and link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/973163[Certified third-party hypervisors]. In most cases, you must specify the `platform.none: {}` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` configuration file. The following list shows the only exceptions and the corresponding parameter to specify in the `install-config.yaml` configuration file:
** {aws-first}, where you use `platform=aws`
** {gcp-first}, where you use `platform=gcp`
** {azure-first}, where you use `platform=azure`
* *Production-grade server:* Installing {product-title} on a single node requires a server with sufficient resources to run {product-title} services and a production workload.

.Minimum resource requirements
[options="header"]
|====
|Profile|vCPU|Memory|Storage
|Minimum|8 vCPUs|16 GB of RAM| 120 GB
|====
+
[NOTE]
====
One vCPU equals one physical core. However, if you enable simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or Hyper-Threading, use the following formula to calculate the number of vCPUs that represent one physical core:

* (threads per core × cores) × sockets = vCPUs

* Adding Operators during the installation process might increase the minimum resource requirements.
====
+
The server must have a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) when booting with virtual media.
+
[NOTE]
====
BMC is not supported on {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-power-name}.
====

* *Networking:* The server must have access to the internet or access to a local registry if it is not connected to a routable network. The server must have a DHCP reservation or a static IP address for the Kubernetes API, ingress route, and cluster node domain names. You must configure the DNS to resolve the IP address to each of the following fully qualified domain names (FQDN):
+
.Required DNS records
[options="header"]
|====
|Usage|FQDN|Description
|Kubernetes API|`api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`| Add a DNS A/AAAA or CNAME record. This record must be resolvable by both clients external to the cluster and within the cluster.
|Internal API|`api-int.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`| Add a DNS A/AAAA or CNAME record when creating the ISO manually. This record must be resolvable by nodes within the cluster.
|Ingress route|`*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`| Add a wildcard DNS A/AAAA or CNAME record that targets the node. This record must be resolvable by both clients external to the cluster and within the cluster.
|====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Without persistent IP addresses, communications between the `apiserver` and `etcd` might fail.
