= Creating a Cluster API infrastructure resource

You can create a provider-specific infrastructure resource by creating a YAML manifest file and applying it with the {oc-first}.

.Prerequisites

* You have deployed an {product-title} cluster.

* You have enabled the use of the Cluster API.

* You have access to the cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.

* You have installed the {oc-first}.

* You have the cluster ID value.

* You have created and applied the cluster resource.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file similar to the following. This procedure uses `<infrastructure_resource_file>.yaml` as an example file name.

--
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/<version> # <1>
kind: <infrastructure_kind> # <2>
metadata:
  name: <cluster_name> # <3>
  namespace: openshift-cluster-api
spec: # <4>
----
<1> The `apiVersion` varies by platform.
For more information, see the sample Cluster API infrastructure resource YAML for your provider.
The following values are valid:
* `infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta2`: The version that {aws-first} clusters use.
* `infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1`: The version that {gcp-first} and {vmw-first} clusters use.
<2> Specify the infrastructure kind for the cluster.
This value must match the value for your platform.
The following values are valid:
* `AWSCluster`: The cluster is running on {aws-short}.
* `GCPCluster`: The cluster is running on {gcp-short}.
* `VSphereCluster`: The cluster is running on {vmw-short}.
<3> Specify the name of the cluster.
<4> Specify the details for your environment.
These parameters are provider specific.
For more information, see the sample Cluster API infrastructure resource YAML for your provider.

. Create the infrastructure CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <infrastructure_resource_file>.yaml
----

.Verification

* Confirm that the infrastructure CR is created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get <infrastructure_kind>
----
+
where `<infrastructure_kind>` is the value that corresponds to your platform.
+
.Example output
[source,text]
----
NAME             CLUSTER          READY
<cluster_name>   <cluster_name>   true
