= Understanding the custom metrics autoscaler

The custom metrics autoscaler uses the Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaler (KEDA) and is built on top of the {product-title} horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA).

The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator scales your pods up and down based on custom, external metrics from specific applications. Your other applications continue to use other scaling methods. You configure _triggers_, also known as scalers, which are the source of events and metrics that the custom metrics autoscaler uses to determine how to scale. The custom metrics autoscaler uses a metrics API to convert the external metrics to a form that {product-title} can use. The custom metrics autoscaler creates a horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) that performs the actual scaling. The custom metrics autoscaler currently supports only the Prometheus trigger, which can use the installed {product-title} monitoring or an external Prometheus server as the metrics source.  

To use the custom metrics autoscaler, you create a `ScaledObject` or `ScaledJob` object, which defines the scaling metadata. You specify the deployment or job to scale, the source of the metrics to scale on (trigger), and other parameters such as the minimum and maximum replica counts allowed. 

[NOTE]
====
You can create only one scaled object or scaled job for each workload that you want to scale. Also, you cannot use a scaled object or scaled job and the horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) on the same workload.

You can create only one scaled object or scaled job for each workload that you want to scale. Also, you cannot use a scaled object or scaled job and the horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) on the same workload. If you want to scale based on a custom trigger and CPU/Memory, you can create multiple triggers in the scaled object or scaled job.

You can verify that the autoscaling has taken place by reviewing the number of pods in your custom resource or by reviewing the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator logs for messages similar to the following:

[source,terminal]
----
Successfully set ScaleTarget replica count
