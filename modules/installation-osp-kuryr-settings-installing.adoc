= Adjusting Kuryr ports pools during installation

During installation, you can configure how Kuryr manages {rh-openstack-first} Neutron ports to control the speed and efficiency of pod creation.

.Prerequisites

* Create and modify the `install-config.yaml` file.

.Procedure

. From a command line, create the manifest files:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory> <1>
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the name of the directory that
contains the `install-config.yaml` file for your cluster.

. Create a file that is named `cluster-network-03-config.yml` in the
`<installation_directory>/manifests/` directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ touch <installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-network-03-config.yml <1>
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the directory name that contains the
`manifests/` directory for your cluster.
+
After creating the file, several network configuration files are in the
`manifests/` directory, as shown:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ls <installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-network-*
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
cluster-network-01-crd.yml
cluster-network-02-config.yml
cluster-network-03-config.yml
----

. Open the `cluster-network-03-config.yml` file in an editor,  and enter a custom resource (CR) that describes the Cluster Network Operator configuration that you want:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit networks.operator.openshift.io cluster
----

. Edit the settings to meet your requirements. The following file is provided as an example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  clusterNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
    hostPrefix: 23
  serviceNetwork:
  - 172.30.0.0/16
  defaultNetwork:
    type: Kuryr
    kuryrConfig:
      enablePortPoolsPrepopulation: false <1>
      poolMinPorts: 1 <2>
      poolBatchPorts: 3 <3>
      poolMaxPorts: 5 <4>
      openstackServiceNetwork: 172.30.0.0/15 <5>
----
<1> Set `enablePortPoolsPrepopulation` to `true` to make Kuryr create new Neutron ports when the first pod on the network for pods is created in a namespace. This setting raises the Neutron ports quota but can reduce the time that is required to spawn pods. The default value is `false`.
<2> Kuryr creates new ports for a pool if the number of free ports in that pool is lower than the value of `poolMinPorts`. The default value is `1`.
<3> `poolBatchPorts` controls the number of new ports that are created if the number of free ports is lower than the value of `poolMinPorts`. The default value is `3`.
<4> If the number of free ports in a pool is higher than the value of  `poolMaxPorts`, Kuryr deletes them until the number matches that value. Setting this value to `0` disables this upper bound, preventing pools from shrinking. The default value is `0`.
<5> The `openStackServiceNetwork` parameter defines the CIDR range of the network from which IP addresses are allocated to {rh-openstack} Octavia's LoadBalancers.
+
If this parameter is used with the Amphora driver, Octavia takes two IP addresses from this network for each load balancer: one for OpenShift and the other for VRRP connections. Because these IP addresses are managed by {product-title} and Neutron respectively, they must come from different pools.
Therefore, the value of `openStackServiceNetwork` must be at least twice the size of the value of `serviceNetwork`, and the value of `serviceNetwork` must overlap entirely with the range that is defined by `openStackServiceNetwork`.
+
The CNO verifies that VRRP IP addresses that are taken from the range that is defined by this parameter do not overlap with the range that is defined by the `serviceNetwork` parameter.
+
If this parameter is not set, the CNO uses an expanded value of `serviceNetwork` that is determined by decrementing the prefix size by 1.

. Save the `cluster-network-03-config.yml` file, and exit the text editor.

. Optional: Back up the `manifests/cluster-network-03-config.yml` file. The installation program deletes the `manifests/` directory while creating the cluster.
