= AWS government regions

{product-title} supports deploying a cluster to
link:https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us[AWS GovCloud (US)] regions. AWS GovCloud
is specifically designed for US government agencies at the federal, state, and
local level, as well as contractors, educational institutions, and other US
customers that must run sensitive workloads in the cloud.

These regions do not have published {op-system-first} Amazon Machine Images (AMI) to select, so you
must upload a custom AMI that belongs to that region.

The following AWS GovCloud partitions are supported:

* `us-gov-west-1`
* `us-gov-east-1`

The AWS GovCloud region and custom AMI must be manually configured in the
`install-config.yaml` file since {op-system} AMIs are not provided by Red Hat
for those regions.
