= AWS government and secret regions

{product-title} supports deploying a cluster to
link:https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us[AWS GovCloud (US)] regions and the link:https://aws.amazon.com/federal/us-intelligence-community/[AWS Commercial Cloud Services (C2S) Secret Region]. These regions are specifically designed for US government agencies at the federal, state, and
local level, as well as contractors, educational institutions, and other US
customers that must run sensitive workloads in the cloud.

These regions do not have published {op-system-first} Amazon Machine Images (AMI) to select, so you
must upload a custom AMI that belongs to that region.

The following AWS GovCloud partitions are supported:

* `us-gov-west-1`
* `us-gov-east-1`

The following AWS Secret Region partition is supported:

* `us-iso-east-1`
