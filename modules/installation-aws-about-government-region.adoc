= AWS government and secret regions

{product-title} supports deploying a cluster to
link:https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us[AWS GovCloud (US)] regions and the link:https://aws.amazon.com/federal/us-intelligence-community/[AWS Commercial Cloud Services (C2S) Secret Region]. These regions are specifically designed for US government agencies at the federal, state, and
local level, as well as contractors, educational institutions, and other US
customers that must run sensitive workloads in the cloud.

These regions do not have published {op-system-first} Amazon Machine Images (AMI) to select, so you
must upload a custom AMI that belongs to that region.

The following AWS GovCloud partitions are supported:

* `us-gov-west-1`
* `us-gov-east-1`

The following AWS Secret Region partition is supported:

* `us-iso-east-1`

The AWS government or secret region, and accompanying custom AMI, must be manually configured in the
`install-config.yaml` file since {op-system} AMIs are not provided by Red Hat
for those regions.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are deploying to the C2S Secret Region, you must also define a custom CA certificate in the `additionalTrustBundle` field of the `install-config.yaml` file because the AWS API requires a custom CA trust bundle. To allow the installation program to access the AWS API, the CA certificates must also be defined on the machine that runs the installation program. You must add the CA bundle to the trust store on the machine, use the `AWS_CA_BUNDLE` environment variable, or define the CA bundle in the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/setting-global-ca_bundle.html[`ca_bundle`] field of the AWS config file.
