= Connecting the VPC to the on-premise network

To expand the {product-title} cluster deployed on AWS with on-premise bare metal nodes, you must establish network connectivity between them. You will need to configure the networking using a virtual private network or AWS Direct Connect between the AWS VPC and your on-premise network. This allows traffic to flow between the on-premise nodes and the AWS nodes.

Additionally, you need to ensure secure access to the Baseboard Management Controllers (BMCs) of the bare metal nodes. When expanding the cluster with the Baremetal Operator, access to the BMCs is required for remotely managing and monitoring the hardware of your on-premise nodes.

To securely access the BMCs, you can create a separate, secure network segment or use a dedicated VPN connection specifically for BMC access. This way, you can isolate the BMC traffic from other network traffic, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or potential vulnerabilities.

[WARNING]
====
Misconfiguration of the network connection between the AWS and on-premise environments can expose the on-premise network and bare-metal nodes to the internet. That is a significant security risk, which might result in an attacker having full access to the exposed machines, and through them to the private network in these environments.
