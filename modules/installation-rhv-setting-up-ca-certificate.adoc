= Setting up the CA certificate

Download the CA certificate from the {rh-virtualization-first} Manager and set it up on the installer machine. Later, you will provide the certificate to the installer software.

There are two ways to download the certificate. You click a link on the Manager's webpage, or you use a `curl` command.

.Procedure

. Download the CA certificate using either of these methods:
** Go to the the Manager's webpage at `https://<engine-fqdn>/ovirt-engine/` and click the *CA Certificate* link.
** Run the following command:
----
$ curl -k 'https://<engine-fqdn>/ovirt-engine/services/pki-resource?resource=ca-certificate&format=X509-PEM-CA' -o /tmp/ca.pem  <1>
----
<1> For `<engine-fqdn>`, specify the fully qualified domain name of the {rh-virtualization} Manager, such as `rhv-env.virtlab.example.com`.
+
. For Linux, copy the CA certificate to the directory for server certificates, and update the CA trust. For example:
+
----
$ cp /tmp/ca.pem /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ca.pem
$ update-ca-trust
----
+
For macOS, double-click the certificate file and use the *Keychain Access* utility to add it to the *System* keychain.
+
NOTE: If youâ€™re using your own certificate authority, make sure the system trusts it.
