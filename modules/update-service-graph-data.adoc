= Creating the OpenShift Update Service graph data container image

The OpenShift Update Service requires a graph-data container image, from which the OpenShift Update Service retrieves information about channel membership and blocked update edges. Graph data is typically fetched directly from the upgrade graph data repository. In environments where an internet connection is unavailable, loading this information from an init container is another way to make the graph data available to the OpenShift Update Service. The role of the init container is to provide a local copy of the graph data, and during pod initialization, the init container copies the data to a volume that is accessible by the service.

.Procedure

. Create a Dockerfile, for example, `./Dockerfile`, containing the following:
+
[source,terminal]
----
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:8.1

RUN curl -L -o cincinnati-graph-data.tar.gz https://github.com/openshift/cincinnati-graph-data/archive/master.tar.gz

CMD exec /bin/bash -c "tar xvzf cincinnati-graph-data.tar.gz -C /var/lib/cincinnati/graph-data/ --strip-components=1"
----

. Use the docker file created in the above step to build a graph-data container image, for example, `registry.example.com/openshift/graph-data:latest`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman build -f ./Dockerfile -t registry.example.com/openshift/graph-data:latest
----

. Push the graph-data container image created in the previous step to a repository that is accessible to the OpenShift Update Service, for example, `registry.example.com/openshift/graph-data:latest`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman push registry.example.com/openshift/graph-data:latest
----
+
[NOTE]
====
To push a graph data image to a local registry in a disconnected environment, copy the graph-data container image created in the previous step to a repository that is accessible to the OpenShift Update Service. Run `oc image mirror --help` for available options.
