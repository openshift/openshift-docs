[id="ossm-release-3-2-new-features-enhancements_{context}"]
= {SMProductName} version 3.2 new features and enhancements

[role="_abstract"]
This release makes {SMProductName} 3.2 generally available, adds new features, addresses Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), and is supported on {ocp-product-title} 4.18 and later.

For a list of supported component versions and support features, see "Service Mesh 3.2 feature support tables".

When upgrading from {SMProduct} 2.x, you must first migrate to version 3.0 and then to version 3.1. Then, you can upgrade to version 3.2. For more information, see "Migrating from Service Mesh 2 to Service Mesh 3".

[id="general-availability-of-istio-ambient-mode_{context}"]
== General availability of Istio ambient mode

This enhancement brings the core features of {istio} ambient mode, ztunnel, and waypoint, to general availability. Ambient mode reduces the resource costs of running a service mesh by removing the need for sidecar proxies with a new data plane architecture that consists of the following two levels of proxy:

* The layer 4 node level ztunnel proxy

* The layer 7 application level waypoint proxy

[id="Updated-feature-support-matrix-for-ambient-mode_{context}"]
== Updated feature support matrix for ambient mode

This enhancement provides an updated feature support matrix for {istio} ambient mode. Not all sidecar mode features are supported in ambient mode. For detailed information about supported and unsupported features, see "Service Mesh feature support tables".

[id="network-policy-updates-for-ambient-mode-traffic_{context}"]
== Network policy updates may be required for ambient mode traffic

{istio} ambient mode uses an application-layer tunnel (L7) called `HBONE` to carry TCP traffic (L4) securely between workloads. The `ztunnel` component tunnels pod traffic over TCP port `15008`. If existing {k8s} `NetworkPolicy` configurations block inbound traffic on this port, update them to allow inbound TCP traffic on port `15008` for ambient workloads. Sidecar workloads must also allow inbound traffic on this port to communicate with ambient workloads.
For more information, see "Configuring network policies for ambient mode".

[id="ensuring-probe-reliability-with-OVN-Kubernetes-local-gateway-mode_{context}"]
== Ensuring probe reliability with OVN-Kubernetes local gateway mode

To ensure liveness and readiness probes continue to function correctly for workloads running in {istio} ambient mode, you must enable OVN-Kubernetes local gateway mode by setting `routingViaHost: true` in the `gatewayConfig` specification.
For more information, see the "OVN-Kubernetes documentation"

[id="direct-navigation-to-network-traffic-from-ossmc_{context}"]
== Direct Navigation to Network Traffic from {ossmc-full} 

Before this update, {SMPlugin} users could not navigate directly from {SMProductShortName} to Network Traffic. With this update, users can now click a workload in the {SMProductShortName} Traffic Graph and find a new `Network Traffic` link in the side panel. This feature gives users one-click access to network flow data for that specific workload. The link only appears if the NetObserv plugin is successfully installed and detected by the console.

[id="enhanced-networkpolicy-coverage-for-ambient-mode-components_{context}"]
== Enhanced NetworkPolicy Coverage for Ambient Mode Components

With the 3.2 release, enabling the global `networkPolicy` setting now extends `NetworkPolicy` creation to include `istio-cni` and `ztunnel` resources, in addition to the previously supported `istiod` and `gateway` resources.
