= Managed cluster updates

Description::
+
--
You can upgrade versions of {product-title}, Day 2 Operators, and managed cluster configurations, by declaring the required version in the `Policy` custom resources (CRs) that target the clusters to be upgraded.

Policy controllers periodically check for policy compliance.
If the result is negative, a violation report is created.
If the policy remediation action is set to `enforce` the violations are remediated according to the updated policy.
If the policy remediation action is set to `inform`, the process ends with a non-compliant status report and responsibility to initiate the upgrade is left to the user to perform during an appropriate maintenance window.

The {cgu-operator-first} extends {rh-rhacm-first} with features to manage the rollout of upgrades or configuration throughout the lifecycle of the fleet of clusters.
It operates in progressive, limited size batches of clusters.
When upgrades to {product-title} or the Day 2 Operators are required, {cgu-operator} progressively rolls out the updates by stepping through the set of policies and switching them to an "enforce" policy to push the configuration to the managed cluster.

The custom resource (CR) that {cgu-operator} uses to build the remediation plan is the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR.

You can use image-based upgrade (IBU) with the Lifecycle Agent as an alternative upgrade path for the {sno} cluster platform version.
IBU uses an OCI image generated from a dedicated seed cluster to install {sno} on the target cluster.

{cgu-operator} uses the `ImageBasedGroupUpgrade` CR to roll out image-based upgrades to a set of identified clusters.

Limits and requirements::
* You can perform direct upgrades for {sno} clusters using image-based upgrade for {product-title} `<4.y>` to `<4.y+2>`, and `<4.y.z>` to `<4.y.z+n>`.
* Image-based upgrade uses custom images that are specific to the hardware platform that the clusters are running on.
Different hardware platforms require separate seed images.

Engineering considerations::
* In edge deployments, you can minimize the disruption to managed clusters by managing the timing and rollout of changes.
Set all policies to `inform` to monitor compliance without triggering automatic enforcement.
Similarly, configure Day 2 Operator subscriptions to manual to prevent updates from occurring outside of scheduled maintenance windows.
* The recommended upgrade aproach for {sno} clusters is the image-based upgrade.
* For multi-node cluster upgrades, consider the following `MachineConfigPool` CR configurations to reduce upgrade times:

** Pause configuration deployments to nodes during a maintenance window by setting the `paused` field to `true`.
** Adjust the `maxUnavailable` field to control how many nodes in the pool can be updated simultaneously.
The `MaxUnavailable` field defines the percentage of nodes in the pool that can be simultaneously unavailable during a `MachineConfig` object update.
Set `maxUnavailable` to the maximum tolerable value.
This reduces the number of reboots in a cluster during upgrades which results in shorter upgrade times.
** Resume configuration deployments by setting the `paused` field to `false`. The configuration changes are applied in a single reboot.
* During cluster installation, you can pause `MachineConfigPool` CRs by setting the `paused` field to `true` and setting `maxUnavailable` to 100% to improve installation times.
