= Configuring monitoring for application

This procedure shows, on an example, how an application developer can deploy an application and configure monitoring for it.

.Prerequisites

* Make sure you have configured cluster for application monitoring. In this example, it is presumed that Prometheus and Alertmanager instances were installed in the `default` namespace.

.Procedure

The following steps present snippets of YAML files. For each step, put the snippet into a YAML file, for example, `deploy.yaml` and run this command to apply the configuration file to the cluster:

  $ oc apply -f deploy.yaml

. Deploy a sample application:

  apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: example-app
    namespace: default
  spec:
    replicas: 1
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: example-app
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: example-app
          image: quay.io/coreos/prometheus-example-app
          ports:
          - name: web
            containerPort: 8080

. Expose the sample application as a service:

  kind: Service
  apiVersion: v1
  metadata:
    name: example-app
    namespace: default
    labels:
      tier: frontend
  spec:
    selector:
      app: example-app
    ports:
    - name: web
      port: 8080

. Create a service monitor for the sample application. This will add your application as a target for monitoring:

  apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
  kind: ServiceMonitor
  metadata:
    name: example-app
    namespace: default
    labels:
      k8s-app: example-app
  spec:
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        tier: frontend
    endpoints:
    - port: web

. Forward 9090 to the Prometheus UI:

  $ oc port-forward svc/prometheus-operated 9090

. Navigate to the Prometheus UI at http://localhost:9090/targets to see the sample application being monitored.
