= About configuring the router

To make ingress optional, you can configure {microshift-short} ingress router settings to manage which ports, if any, are exposed to network traffic. Specified routing is an example of ingress load balancing.

* The default ingress router is always on, running on all IP addresses on the `http: 80` and `https: 443` ports.
* Default router settings allow access to any namespace.

Some applications running on top of {microshift-short} might not require the default router and instead create their own. You can configure the router to control both ingress and namespace access.

[TIP]
====
You can check for the presence of the default router in your {microshift-short} installation before you begin configurations by using the `oc get deployment -n openshift-ingress` command, which returns the following output:

[source,terminal]
----
NAME             READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
router-default   1/1     1            1           2d23h

== Router settings and valid values

The ingress router settings consist of the following parameters and valid values:

.Example `config.yaml` router settings
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
ingress:
  listenAddress:
    - ""  # <1>
  ports: # <2>
    http: 80
    https: 443
  routeAdmissionPolicy:
    namespaceOwnership: InterNamespaceAllowed # <3>
  status: Managed # <4>
# ...
----
<1> The `ingress.listenAddress` value defaults to the entire network of the host. Valid customizable values can be a single IP address or host name or a list of IP addresses or host names.
<2> Valid values for both port entries are a single, unique port in the 1-65535 range. The values of the `ports.http` and `ports.https` fields cannot be the same.
<3> Default value. Allows routes to claim different paths of the same host name across namespaces.
<4> Default value. `Managed` is required for the ingress ports to remain open.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The firewalld service is bypassed by the default {microshift-short} router and by configurations that enable the router. Ingress and egress must be controlled by setting network policies when the router is active.
