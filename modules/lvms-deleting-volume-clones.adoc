= Deleting volume clones

You can delete volume clones.
[IMPORTANT]
====
When you delete a persistent volume claim (PVC), {lvms} deletes only the source persistent volume claim (PVC) but not the clones of the PVC.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to {product-title} as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.

.Procedure

. Log in to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

. Delete the cloned PVC by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# oc delete pvc <clone_pvc_name> -n <namespace>
----

.Verification

* To verify that the volume clone is deleted, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pvc -n <namespace>
----
+
The deleted volume clone must not be present in the output of this command.
