= Runtime configuration for an InfiniBand-based SR-IOV attachment

When attaching a pod to an additional network, you can specify a runtime configuration to make specific customizations for the pod. For example, you can request a specific MAC hardware address.

You specify the runtime configuration by setting an annotation in the pod specification. The annotation key is `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks`, and it accepts a JSON object that describes the runtime configuration.

The following JSON describes the runtime configuration options for an InfiniBand-based SR-IOV network attachment.

where:

`name`:: The name of the SR-IOV network attachment definition CR.
`infiniband-guid`:: The InfiniBand GUID for the SR-IOV device. To use this feature, you also must specify `{ "infinibandGUID": true }` in the `SriovIBNetwork` object.
`ips`:: The IP addresses for the SR-IOV device that is allocated from the resource type defined in the SR-IOV network attachment definition CR. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported. To use this feature, you also must specify `{ "ips": true }` in the `SriovIBNetwork` object.
