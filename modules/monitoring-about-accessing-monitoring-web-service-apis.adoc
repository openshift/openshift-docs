= About accessing monitoring web service APIs

You can directly access web service API endpoints from the command line for the following monitoring stack components:

* Prometheus
* Alertmanager
* Thanos Ruler
* Thanos Querier

[NOTE]
====
To access Thanos Ruler and Thanos Querier service APIs, the requesting account must have `get` permission on the namespaces resource, which can be granted by binding the `cluster-monitoring-view` cluster role to the account.
====

Accessing web service APIs only supports using a Bearer Token for authentication.
