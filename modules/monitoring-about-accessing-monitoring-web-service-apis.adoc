= About accessing monitoring web service APIs

[role="_abstract"]
To interact with the monitoring stack by using the command line, you can access web service API endpoints for Prometheus, Alertmanager, Thanos Ruler, and Thanos Querier. Direct API access requires bearer token authentication and the correct namespace permissions.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To access Thanos Ruler and Thanos Querier service APIs, the requesting account must have `get` permission on the namespaces resource, which can be granted by binding the `cluster-monitoring-view` cluster role to the account.
====

When you access web service API endpoints for monitoring components, be aware of the following limitations:

* You can only use bearer token authentication to access API endpoints.
* You can only access endpoints in the `/api` path for a route.
If you try to access an API endpoint in a web browser, an `Application is not available` error occurs.
To access monitoring features in a web browser, use the {product-title} web console to review monitoring dashboards.
