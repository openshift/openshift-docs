= Creating policies in code by using the {product-title-short} portal

[role="_abstract"]
You can create new policies in code by using the {product-title-short} portal to save existing policies as YAML files.

.Prerequisites
* You must have {product-title-short} release 4.6 or later installed.
* If you installed {product-title-short} by using the manifest installation method, also called the `roxctl` method, you must manually apply the `config.stackrox.io` CRD that is located in the .zip file at `helm/chart/crds/config.stackrox.io_securitypolicies.yaml` by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kubectl create -f helm/chart/crds/config.stackrox.io_securitypolicies.yaml
----

.Procedure

To create a new policy in code by using the {product-title-short} portal to create the CR:

. In the *Policy Management* page, create a new policy or clone a default policy.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must clone a default policy before you can save it as a CR.
====
. In the row listing the policy, click the overflow menu, {kebab}, and then select *Save as Custom Resource*. To save multiple policies at one time, you can select them and click *Bulk actions* -> *Save as Custom Resources*.
. After editing your policy, you can apply the saved CR by doing one of the following:

* Use the `oc apply` or `kubectl apply` command to apply the CR directly to the Kubernetes namespace where Central is installed.
* Use Argo CD or your GitOps tool to push the CR to the Kubernetes namespace where Central is installed.
