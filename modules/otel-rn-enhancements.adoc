= New features and enhancements

The {OTELName} 3.8 release adds the following features and enhancements:

Operator network policy improvements::
With this update, the Operator network policy for the Kubernetes API server becomes more specific and uses the API Server namespace and pod labels.

Filelog Receiver GA::
With this update, the Filelog Receiver, which was a Technology Preview feature, reaches general availability (GA). This receiver tails and parses logs from files. You can use it, as a sidecar container or DaemonSet, to collect logs from pod filesystems.
