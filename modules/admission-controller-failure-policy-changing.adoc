= Configuring the admission controller failure policy on an existing cluster

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure the admission controller failure policy for an existing cluster. This setting determines whether the API server request is allowed (fail open) or blocked (fail closed) if an error or timeout happens in the {product-title-short} validating webhook evaluation. 

. For a cluster that was installed by using the Operator, in the `SecuredCluster` custom resource (CR), edit the `admissionControl.failurePolicy` parameter to `Ignore` to fail open, or `Fail` to fail closed.
. For a cluster that was installed by using Helm, in the `values-public.yaml` file, set the `admissionControl.failurePolicy` value to parameter to `Ignore` to fail open, or `Fail` to fail closed. Then then run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
helm upgrade -n stackrox \
  stackrox-secured-cluster-services rhacs/secured-cluster-services \
  --reuse-values \
  -f /config/yaml/values-public.yaml \
  -f /config/yaml/values-private.yaml
----
. For clusters installed by another method, you can use the {product-title-short} portal to edit the admission controller failure policy. You cannot edit Operator- or Helm-managed clusters by using the portal. Perform these steps:
.. In the {product-title-short} portal, select *Platform Configuration* -> *Clusters*.
.. Click *Secure a cluster* -> *Legacy installation method*. 
.. In the *Static configuration (requires deployment)* section, in the *Admission controller failure policy* field, select one of the following options:
* *Fail open*: If an error or timeout occurs when a workload admission or update request is being evaluated by the validating webhook, the request should be allowed to reach the API server.
* *Fail closed*: If an error or timeout occurs when a workload admission or update request is being evaluated by the validating webhook, the request should not be allowed to reach the API server, but should be blocked.
.. Select *Next*.
.. Select *Finish*. Because this is a change to the static configuration, you must redeploy the cluster for your changes to take effect.
