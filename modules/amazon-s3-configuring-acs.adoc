= Configuring Amazon S3 integration in {product-title}

To configure Amazon S3 backups, create a new integration in {product-title}.

.Prerequisites
* An existing S3 Bucket.
To create a new bucket with required permissions, see the Amazon documentation topic link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-bucket.html[Creating a bucket].
* `Read`, `write`, and `delete` permissions for the S3 bucket, the *Access key ID*, and the *Secret access key*.
* If you are using *KIAM*, *kube2iam* or another proxy, then an *IAM role* that has the `read`, `write`, and `delete` permissions.

.Procedure
. In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Platform Configuration* -> *Integrations*.
. Scroll down to the *External backups* section and select *Amazon S3*.
. Click *New Integration* (*`add`* icon).
. Enter a name for *Integration Name*.
. Enter the number of backups to retain in the *Backups To Retain* box.
. For *Schedule*, select the backup frequency as daily or weekly and the time to run the backup process.
. Enter the *Bucket* name where you want to store the backup.
. Optionally, enter an *Object Prefix* if you want to save the backups in a specific folder structure.
For more information, see the Amazon documentation topic link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMetadata.html#object-keys[Working with object metadata].
. Enter the *Endpoint* for the bucket if you are using a non-public S3 instance, otherwise leave it blank.
. Enter the *Region* for the bucket.
. Turn on the *Use Container IAM Role* toggle or enter the *Access Key ID*, and the *Secret Access Key*.
. Select *Test* to confirm that the integration with Amazon S3 is working.
. Select *Create* to generate the configuration.

Once configured, {product-title} automatically backs up all data according to the specified schedule.
