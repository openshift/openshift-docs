= Understanding projected volumes

Projected volumes can map any combination of these volume sources into a single directory, allowing the user to:

* automatically populate a single volume with the keys from multiple secrets, config maps, and with downward API information,
so that I can synthesize a single directory with various sources of information;
* populate a single volume with the keys from multiple secrets, config maps, and with downward API information,
explicitly specifying paths for each item, so that I can have full control over the contents of that volume.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When the `RunAsUser` permission is set in the security context of a Linux-based pod, the projected files have the correct permissions set, including container user ownership. However, when the Windows equivalent `RunAsUsername` permission is set in a Windows pod, the kubelet is unable to correctly set ownership on the files in the projected volume.

Therefore, the `RunAsUsername` permission set in the security context of a Windows pod is not honored for Windows projected volumes running in {product-title}.
====

The following general scenarios show how you can use projected volumes.

*Config map, secrets, Downward API.*::
Projected volumes allow you to deploy containers with configuration data that includes passwords.
An application using these resources could be deploying {rh-openstack-first} on Kubernetes. The configuration data might have to be assembled differently depending on if the services are going to be used for production or for testing. If a pod is labeled with production or testing, the downward API selector `metadata.labels` can be used to produce the correct {rh-openstack} configs.

*Config map + secrets.*::
Projected volumes allow you to deploy containers involving configuration data and passwords.
For example, you might execute a config map with some sensitive encrypted tasks that are decrypted using a vault password file.

*ConfigMap + Downward API.*::
Projected volumes allow you to generate a config including the pod name (available via the `metadata.name` selector). This application can then pass the pod name along with requests to easily determine the source without using IP tracking.

*Secrets + Downward API.*::
Projected volumes allow you to use a secret as a public key to encrypt the namespace of the pod (available via the `metadata.namespace` selector).
This example allows the Operator to use the application to deliver the namespace information securely without using an encrypted transport.

== Example Pod specs

The following are examples of `Pod` specs for creating projected volumes.

.Pod with a secret, a Downward API, and a config map

[source,yaml]

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: volume-test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: container-test
    image: busybox
    volumeMounts: <1>
    - name: all-in-one

      readOnly: true <3>
  volumes: <4>

            - key: username
              path: my-group/my-username <8>

              resourceFieldRef:
                containerName: container-test
                resource: limits.cpu
      - configMap: <10>
          name: myconfigmap
          items:
            - key: config
              path: my-group/my-config
              mode: 0777 <11>
----

<1> Add a `volumeMounts` section for each container that needs the secret.
<2> Specify a path to an unused directory where the secret will appear.
<3> Set `readOnly` to `true`.
<4> Add a `volumes` block to list each projected volume source.
<5> Specify any name for the volume.
<6> Set the execute permission on the files.
<7> Add a secret. Enter the name of the secret object. Each secret you want to use must be listed.
<8> Specify the path to the secrets file under the `mountPath`. Here, the secrets file is in *_/projected-volume/my-group/my-username_*.
<9> Add a Downward API source.
<10> Add a ConfigMap source.
<11> Set the mode for the specific projection

[NOTE]
====
If there are multiple containers in the pod, each container needs a `volumeMounts` section, but only one `volumes` section is needed.

.Pod with multiple secrets with a non-default permission mode set

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: volume-test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: container-test
    image: busybox
    volumeMounts:
    - name: all-in-one
      mountPath: "/projected-volume"
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: all-in-one
    projected:
      defaultMode: 0755
      sources:
      - secret:
          name: mysecret
          items:
            - key: username
              path: my-group/my-username
      - secret:
          name: mysecret2
          items:
            - key: password
              path: my-group/my-password
              mode: 511
----

[NOTE]
====
The `defaultMode` can only be specified at the projected level and not for each
volume source. However, as illustrated above, you can explicitly set the `mode`
for each individual projection.

== Pathing Considerations

*Collisions Between Keys when Configured Paths are Identical*:: If you configure any keys with the same path, the pod spec will not be accepted as valid.
In the following example, the specified path for `mysecret` and `myconfigmap` are the same:

          items:

----

Consider the following situations related to the volume file paths.

*Collisions Between Keys without Configured Paths*:: The only run-time validation that can occur is when all the paths are known at pod creation, similar to the above scenario. Otherwise, when a conflict occurs the most recent specified resource will overwrite anything preceding it
(this is true for resources that are updated after pod creation as well).

*Collisions when One Path is Explicit and the Other is Automatically Projected*:: In the event that there is a collision due to a user specified path matching data that is automatically projected,
the latter resource will overwrite anything preceding it as before
