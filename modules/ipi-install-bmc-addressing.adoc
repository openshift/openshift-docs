= BMC addressing

The `address` field for each `bmc` entry is a URL for connecting to the {product-title} cluster nodes, including the type of controller in the URL scheme and its location on the network.

.IPMI

IPMI hosts use `ipmi://<out-of-band-ip>:<port>` and defaults to port `623` if not specified. The following example demonstrates an IPMI configuration within the `install-config.yaml` file.

.RedFish for HPE

To enable RedFish, use `redfish://` or `redfish+http://` to disable TLS. The installer requires both the hostname or the IP address and the path to the system ID. The following example demonstrates a RedFish configuration within the `install-config.yaml` file.

[source,yaml]

platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master

          username: <user>
          password: <password>
----

While it is recommended to have a certificate of authority for the
out-of-band management addresses, you must include `disableCertificateVerification: True` in the `bmc` configuration if using self-signed certificates. The following example demonstrates a RedFish configuration using the `disableCertificateVerification: True` configuration parameter within the `install-config.yaml` file.

.RedFish for Dell

To enable RedFish, use `redfish://` or `redfish+http://` to disable TLS. The installer requires both the hostname or the IP address and the path to the system ID. The following example demonstrates a RedFish configuration within the `install-config.yaml` file.

          username: <user>
          password: <password>
----

While it is recommended to have a certificate of authority for the
out-of-band management addresses, you must include `disableCertificateVerification: True` in the `bmc` configuration if using self-signed certificates.

          username: <user>
          password: <password>
          disableCertificateVerification: True

[NOTE]
====
Currently RedFish is only supported on Dell with iDRAC firmware version `4.20.20.20` or higher for installer-provisioned installations of {product-title} on bare metal deployments.

.RedFish Virtual Media for HPE

To enable RedFish Virtual Media for HPE servers, use `redfish-virtualmedia://` in the `address` setting. The following example demonstrates using RedFish Virtual Media within the `install-config.yaml` file.

[source,yaml]
----
platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: redfish-virtualmedia://<out-of-band-ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/1
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
----

.RedFish Virtual Media for Dell

For RedFish Virtual Media on Dell servers, use `idrac-virtualmedia://` in the `address` setting.

[NOTE]
====
RedFish Virtual Media on Dell servers has a known issue in {product-title} 4.6. The 4.6.1 point release will resolve the issue.
====

The following example demonstrates using iDRAC Virtual Media within the `install-config.yaml` file.

[source,yaml]
----
platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:

          username: <user>
          password: <password>
----

[NOTE]
====
`idrac-virtualmedia` requires iDRAC firmware version 4.20.20.20 or higher.

Ensure the {product-title} cluster nodes have AutoAttach Enabled through the iDRAC console. The menu path is: **Configuration->Virtual Media->Attach Mode->AutoAttach**.
