= Verifying installation

After you complete the installation, run a few vulnerable applications and navigate to the {product-title-short} portal to evaluate the results of security assessments and policy violations.

[NOTE]
====
The sample applications listed in the following section contain critical vulnerabilities and they are specifically designed to verify the build and deploy-time assessment features of {product-title}.
====
To verify installation:

. Find the address of the {product-title-short} portal based on your exposure method:
.. For a route:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get route central -n stackrox
----
.. For a load balancer:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get service central-loadbalancer -n stackrox
----
.. For port forward:
... Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc port-forward svc/central 18443:443 -n stackrox
----
... Navigate to `\https://localhost:18443/`.
. Using the {osp} CLI, create a new project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project test
----
. Start some applications with critical vulnerabilities:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc run shell --labels=app=shellshock,team=test-team \
  --image=vulnerables/cve-2014-6271 -n test
$ oc run samba --labels=app=rce \
  --image=vulnerables/cve-2017-7494 -n test
----

{product-title} automatically scans these deployments for security risks and policy violations as soon as they are submitted to the cluster. Navigate to the {product-title-short} portal to view the violations. You can log in to the {product-title-short} portal by using the default username *admin* and the generated password.
