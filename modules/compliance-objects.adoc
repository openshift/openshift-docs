= Using the ComplianceSuite and ComplianceScan objects directly

While it is recommended that users take advantage of the ScanSetting and ScanSettingBinding objects to define the Suites and Scans, there are valid use cases to define the ComplianceSuites directly:

* Specifying only a single rule to scan. This can be useful for debugging together with the `debug: true` attribute which increases the OpenSCAP scanner verbosity, as the debug mode tends to get quite verbose otherwise. Limiting the test to one rule helps to lower the amount of debug information.

* Providing a custom nodeSelector. In order for a remediation to be applicable, the nodeSelector must match a pool.

* Pointing the Scan to a bespoke ConfigMap with a tailoring file.

* For testing or development when the overhead of parsing profiles from bundles is not required.

The following example shows a ComplianceSuite that scans the worker machines with only a single rule:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ComplianceSuite
metadata:
  name: workers-compliancesuite
spec:
  scans:
    - name: workers-scan
      profile: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_moderate
      content: ssg-rhcos4-ds.xml
      contentImage: quay.io/complianceascode/ocp4:latest
      debug: true
      rule: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_rule_no_direct_root_logins
      nodeSelector:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
----

The ComplianceSuite object and the ComplianceScan objects referred to above specify several attributes in a format that OpenSCAP expects.

To find out the profile, content, or rule values, you can start by creating a similar Suite from ScanSetting and ScanSettingBinding or inspect the objects parsed from the ProfileBundles like Rules or Profiles. Those objects contain the `xccdf_org` identifiers you can use to refer to them from a ComplianceSuite.
