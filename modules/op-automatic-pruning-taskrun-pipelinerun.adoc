= Automatic pruning of task runs and pipeline runs 

Stale `TaskRun` and `PipelineRun` objects and their executed instances occupy physical resources that can be used for active runs. For optimal utilization of these resources, {pipelines-title} provides annotations that cluster administrators can use to automatically prune the unused objects and their instances in various namespaces.

[NOTE]
====
Configuring automatic pruning by specifying annotations affects the entire namespace. You cannot selectively auto-prune an individual task run or pipeline run in a namespace.
