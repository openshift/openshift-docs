= Automatic pruning of task runs and pipeline runs

[role="_abstract"]
You can automatically prune stale `TaskRun` and `PipelineRun` resources to free up cluster resources and maintain optimal performance. {pipelines-title} provides a configurable pruner component that removes unused objects based on your defined policies.

[NOTE]
====
You can configure the pruner for your entire installation by using the `TektonConfig` custom resource and modify configuration for a namespace by using namespace annotations. However, you cannot selectively auto-prune an individual task run or pipeline run in a namespace.
