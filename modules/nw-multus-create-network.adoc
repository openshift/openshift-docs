= Creating an additional network attachment with the Cluster Network Operator

The Cluster Network Operator (CNO) manages additional network definitions. When
you specify an additional network to create, the CNO creates the
`NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object automatically.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not edit the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` objects that the Cluster Network
Operator manages. Doing so might disrupt network traffic on your additional
network.
====

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Optional: Create the namespace for the additional networks:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create namespace <namespace_name>
----

. To edit the CNO configuration, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit networks.operator.openshift.io cluster
----

. Modify the CR that you are creating by adding the configuration for the
additional network that you are creating, as in the following example CR.
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  # ...
  additionalNetworks:
  - name: tertiary-net
    namespace: namespace2
    type: Raw
    rawCNIConfig: |-
      {
        "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
        "name": "tertiary-net",
        "type": "ipvlan",
        "master": "eth1",
        "mode": "l2",
        "ipam": {
          "type": "static",
          "addresses": [
            {
              "address": "192.168.1.23/24"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
----

. Save your changes and quit the text editor to commit your changes.

.Verification

* Confirm that the CNO created the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object by running the following command. There might be a delay before the CNO creates the object.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get network-attachment-definitions -n <namespace>
----
+
--
where:

`<namespace>`:: Specifies the namespace for the network attachment that you added to the CNO configuration.
