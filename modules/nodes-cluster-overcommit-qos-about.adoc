= Understanding overcomitment and quality of service classes

A node is _overcommitted_ when it has a pod scheduled that makes no request, or
when the sum of limits across all pods on that node exceeds available machine
capacity.

In an overcommitted environment, it is possible that the pods on the node will
attempt to use more compute resource than is available at any given point in
time. When this occurs, the node must give priority to one pod over another. The
facility used to make this decision is referred to as a Quality of Service (QoS)
Class.

For each compute resource, a container is divided into one of three QoS classes
with decreasing order of priority:

.Quality of Service Classes
[options="header",cols="1,1,5"]
|===
|Priority |Class Name |Description

|1 (highest)
|*Guaranteed*
|If limits and optionally requests are set (not equal to 0) for all resources
and they are equal, then the container is classified as *Guaranteed*.

|2
|*Burstable*
|If requests and optionally limits are set (not equal to 0) for all resources,
and they are not equal, then the container is classified as *Burstable*.

|3 (lowest)
|*BestEffort*
|If requests and limits are not set for any of the resources, then the container
is classified as *BestEffort*.
|===

Memory is an incompressible resource, so in low memory situations, containers
that have the lowest priority are terminated first:

- *Guaranteed* containers are considered top priority, and are guaranteed to
only be terminated if they exceed their limits, or if the system is under memory
pressure and there are no lower priority containers that can be evicted.
- *Burstable* containers under system memory pressure are more likely to be
terminated once they exceed their requests and no other *BestEffort* containers
exist.
- *BestEffort* containers are treated with the lowest priority. Processes in
these containers are first to be terminated if the system runs out of memory.

== Understanding how to reserve memory across quality of service tiers

You can use the `qos-reserved` parameter to specify a percentage of memory to be reserved
by a pod in a particular QoS level. This feature attempts to reserve requested resources to exclude pods
from lower OoS classes from using resources requested by pods in higher QoS classes.

{product-title} uses the `qos-reserved` parameter as follows:

- A value of `qos-reserved=memory=100%` will prevent the `Burstable` and `BestEffort` QOS classes from consuming memory
that was requested by a higher QoS class. This increases the risk of inducing OOM
on `BestEffort` and `Burstable` workloads in favor of increasing memory resource guarantees
for `Guaranteed` and `Burstable` workloads.

- A value of `qos-reserved=memory=50%` will allow the `Burstable` and `BestEffort` QOS classes
to consume half of the memory requested by a higher QoS class.

- A value of `qos-reserved=memory=0%`
will allow a `Burstable` and `BestEffort` QoS classes to consume up to the full node
allocatable amount if available, but increases the risk that a `Guaranteed` workload
will not have access to requested memory. This condition effectively disables this feature.
