== Resolved issues

.{ibm-cloud-name} Object Storage is now supported as a backup storage provider

{ibm-cloud-name} Object Storage is one of the AWS S3 compatible backup storage providers, which was unsupported previously.  
With this update, {ibm-cloud-name} Object Storage is now supported as an AWS S3 compatible backup storage provider.

.OADP operator now correctly reports the missing region error

Previously, when you specified `profile:default` without specifying the `region` in the AWS Backup Storage Location (BSL) configuration, the OADP operator failed to report the `missing region` error on the Data Protection Application (DPA) custom resource (CR). This update corrects validation of DPA BSL specification for AWS. As a result, the OADP Operator reports the `missing region` error.

.Custom labels are not removed from the openshift-adp namespace

Previously, the `openshift-adp-controller-manager` pod would reset the labels attached to the `openshift-adp` namespace. This caused synchronization issues for applications requiring custom labels such as Argo CD, leading to improper functionality. With this update, this issue is fixed and custom labels are not removed from the `openshift-adp` namespace.

.OADP must-gather image collects CRDs

Previously, the OADP `must-gather` image did not collect the custom resource definitions (CRDs) shipped by OADP. Consequently, you could not use the `omg` tool to extract data in the support shell. 
With this fix, the `must-gather` image now collects CRDs shipped by OADP and can use the `omg` tool to extract data.

.Garbage collection has the correct description for the default frequency value

Previously, the `garbage-collection-frequency` field had a wrong description for the default frequency value. With this update, `garbage-collection-frequency` has a correct value of one hour for the `gc-controller` reconciliation default frequency.

.FIPS Mode flag is available in OperatorHub

By setting the `fips-compliant` flag to `true`, the FIPS mode flag is now added to the OADP Operator listing in OperatorHub. This feature was enabled in OADP 1.3.0 but did not show up in the Red Hat Container catalog as being FIPS enabled.

.CSI plugin does not panic with a nil pointer when csiSnapshotTimeout is set to a short duration

Previously, when the `csiSnapshotTimeout` parameter was set to a short duration, the CSI plugin encountered the following error: `plugin panicked: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference`.

With this fix, the backup fails with the following error: `Timed out awaiting reconciliation of volumesnapshot`.

.Backup and storage restrictions for {sno-caps} clusters deployed on {ibm-power-name} and {ibm-z-name} platforms

Review the following backup and storage related restrictions for {sno-caps} clusters that are deployed on {ibm-power-name} and {ibm-z-name} platforms:
 
Storage:: Only NFS storage is currently compatible with {sno} clusters deployed on {ibm-power-name} and {ibm-z-name} platforms.
Backup:: Only the backing up applications with File System Backup such as `kopia` and `restic` are supported for backup and restore operations.

.Cassandra application pods enter in the CrashLoopBackoff status after restoring OADP

After OADP restores, the Cassandra application pods might enter in the `CrashLoopBackoff` status. To work around this problem, delete the `StatefulSet` pods with any error or the `CrashLoopBackoff` state after restoring OADP. The `StatefulSet` controller recreates these pods and it runs normally.
