== Enhancements

The following enhancements have been made with {ols-official} 0.2.0:

* This release introduces the {ols-official} Operator as a Technology Preview release. Previously, the {ols-short} Operator was a Developer Preview release. 

* Existing Developer Preview installations of {ols-official} version 0.1.6 and earlier that use the preview {olm} (OLM) channel must switch the update channel to *alpha* and then install the 0.2.0 Technology Preview version.

* Beginning in this release, the {ols-official} Operator can be installed on an {ocp-product-title} cluster in a disconnected environment.

* With this release, {rhelai} can be configured as the Large Language Model (LLM) provider.

* This release adds the ability to attach a YAML file to a question you ask on the pages accessible from *Networking* in the {ocp-product-title} web console. Attaching a YAML file to a question can provide additional context, enabling {ols-long} to provide a more refined answer.
