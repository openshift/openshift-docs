= Installing the PTP Operator

As a cluster administrator, you can install the PTP Operator using the {product-title} CLI or the web console.

[id="install-ptp-operator-cli_{context}"]
== CLI: Installing the PTP Operator

As a cluster administrator, you can install the Operator using the CLI.

.Prerequisites

* A cluster installed on bare-metal hardware with nodes that have hardware that supports PTP.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. To create a namespace for the PTP Operator, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat << EOF| oc create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: openshift-ptp
  labels:
    name: openshift-ptp
    openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"
EOF
----

. To create an Operator group for the Operator, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat << EOF| oc create -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: ptp-operators
  namespace: openshift-ptp
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
  - openshift-ptp
EOF
----

. Subscribe to the PTP Operator.

.. Run the following command to set the {product-title} major and minor version as an environment variable, which is used as the `channel` value in the next
step.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ OC_VERSION=$(oc version -o yaml | grep openshiftVersion | \
    grep -o '[0-9]*[.][0-9]*' | head -1)
----

.. To create a subscription for the PTP Operator, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat << EOF| oc create -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: ptp-operator-subscription
  namespace: openshift-ptp
spec:
  channel: "${OC_VERSION}"
  name: ptp-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
EOF
----

. To verify that the Operator is installed, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get csv -n openshift-ptp \
  -o custom-columns=Name:.metadata.name,Phase:.status.phase
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Name                                        Phase
ptp-operator.4.4.0-202006160135             Succeeded

== Web console: Installing the PTP Operator

As a cluster administrator, you can install the Operator using the web console.

[NOTE]
====
You have to create the namespace and operator group as mentioned
in the previous section.
====

.Procedure

. Install the PTP Operator using the {product-title} web console:

.. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

.. Choose  *PTP Operator* from the list of available Operators, and then click *Install*.

.. On the *Install Operator* page, under *A specific namespace on the cluster* select *openshift-ptp*. Then, click *Install*.

. Optional: Verify that the PTP Operator installed successfully:

.. Switch to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page.

.. Ensure that *PTP Operator* is listed in the *openshift-ptp* project with a *Status* of *InstallSucceeded*.
+
[NOTE]
====
During installation an Operator might display a *Failed* status.
If the installation later succeeds with an *InstallSucceeded* message, you can ignore the *Failed* message.
====

+
If the operator does not appear as installed, to troubleshoot further:

+
* Go to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page and inspect
the *Operator Subscriptions* and *Install Plans* tabs for any failure or errors
under *Status*.
* Go to the *Workloads* -> *Pods* page and check the logs for pods in the
`openshift-ptp` project.
