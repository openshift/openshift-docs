= Making Project Networks Global

.Prerequisites

* The `Multitenant` SDN plug-in must be enabled in your cluster.


.Procedure

*  To allow projects to access all pods and services in the cluster and to allow
all pods and services in the cluster to access the projects,
run the following command:
+
----
$ oc adm pod-network make-projects-global <project1> <project2>
----
+
Alternatively, instead of specifying specific project names, you can use the
`--selector=<project_selector>` option.

In the above example, all of the pods and services in
`<project1>` and `<project2>`
can now access any pods and services in the cluster.
All of the pods and services in the cluster can access
`<project1>` and `<project2>`.
