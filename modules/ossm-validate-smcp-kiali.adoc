= Validating your SMCP installation with Kiali

You can use the Kiali console to validate your {SMProductShortName} installation. The Kiali console offers several ways to validate your {SMProductShortName} components are deployed and configured properly.

. Prerequisites

* The {SMProductName} Operator must be installed.
* Access to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
ifndef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* You are logged in to {product-title} as`cluster-admin`.
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
ifdef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* You are logged in to {product-title} as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console, navigate to *Networking* -> *Routes*.

. On the *Routes* page, select the {SMProductShortName} control plane project, for example `istio-system`, from the *Namespace* menu.
+
The *Location* column displays the linked address for each route.
+
. If necessary, use the filter to find the route for the Kiali console. Click the route *Location* to launch the console.

. Click *Log In With OpenShift*.
+
When you first log in to the Kiali Console, you see the *Overview* page which displays all the namespaces in your service mesh that you have permission to view. When there are multiple namespaces shown on the *Overview* page, Kiali shows namespaces with health or validation problems first.

+
The tile for each namespace displays the number of labels, the *Istio Config* health, the number of and *Applications* health, and *Traffic* for the namespace. If you are validating the console installation and namespaces have not yet been added to the mesh, there might not be any data to display other than `istio-system`.

. Kiali has four dashboards specifically for the namespace where the {SMProductShortName} control plane is installed.  To view these dashboards, click the *Options* menu {kebab} on the tile for the control plane namespace, for example, `istio-system`, and select one of the following options:

** *Istio Mesh Dashboard*
** *Istio Control Plane Dashboard*
** *Istio Performance Dashboard*
** *Istio Wasm Exetension Dashboard*
+
.Grafana Istio Control Plane Dashboard

+
Kiali also installs two additional Grafana dashboards, available from the Grafana *Home* page:
** *Istio Workload Dashboard*
** *Istio Service Dashboard*
+
. To view the {SMProductShortName} control plane nodes, click the *Graph* page, select the *Namespace* where you installed the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` from the menu, for example `istio-system`.

.. If necessary, click *Display idle nodes*.

.. To learn more about the *Graph* page, click the *Graph tour* link.

.. To view the mesh topology, select one or more additional namespaces from the Service Mesh Member Roll from the *Namespace* menu.

. To view the list of applications in the `istio-system` namespace, click the *Applications* page. Kiali displays the health of the applications.

.. Hover your mouse over the information icon to view any additional information noted in the *Details* column.

. To view the list of workloads in the `istio-system` namespace, click the *Workloads* page. Kiali displays the health of the workloads.

.. Hover your mouse over the information icon to view any additional information noted in the *Details* column.

. To view the list of services in the `istio-system` namespace, click the *Services* page. Kiali displays the health of the services and of the configurations.

.. Hover your mouse over the information icon to view any additional information noted in the *Details* column.

. To view a list of the Istio Configuration objects in the `istio-system` namespace, click the *Istio Config* page. Kiali displays the health of the configuration.

.. If there are configuration errors, click the row and Kiali opens the configuration file with the error highlighted.
