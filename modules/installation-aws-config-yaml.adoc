[id="installation-aws-config-yaml_{context}"]
= Sample customized `install-config.yaml` file for AWS

You can customize the `install-config.yaml` file to specify more details about
your {product-title} cluster's platform or modify the values of the required
parameters.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This sample YAML file is provided for reference only. You must obtain your
`install-config.yaml` file by using the installation program and modify it.

ifndef::gov[]
<1> Required. The installation program prompts you for this value.
endif::gov[]
ifdef::gov[]
<1> Required.
endif::gov[]
<2> Optional: Add this parameter to force the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) to use the specified mode, instead of having the CCO dynamically try to determine the capabilities of the credentials. For details about CCO modes, see the _Cloud Credential Operator_ entry in the _Red Hat Operators reference_ content.
<3> If you do not provide these parameters and values, the installation program
provides the default value.
<4> The `controlPlane` section is a single mapping, but the compute section is a
sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures,
the first line of the `compute` section must begin with a hyphen, `-`, and the
first line of the `controlPlane` section must not. Although both sections
currently define a single machine pool, it is possible that future versions
of {product-title} will support defining multiple compute pools during
installation. Only one control plane pool is used.
<5> Whether to enable or disable simultaneous multithreading, or
`hyperthreading`. By default, simultaneous multithreading is enabled
to increase the performance of your machines' cores. You can disable it by
setting the parameter value to `Disabled`. If you disable simultaneous
multithreading in some cluster machines, you must disable it in all cluster
machines.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you disable simultaneous multithreading, ensure that your capacity planning
accounts for the dramatically decreased machine performance. Use larger
instance types, such as `m4.2xlarge` or `m5.2xlarge`, for your machines if you
disable simultaneous multithreading.
====
<6> To configure faster storage for etcd, especially for larger clusters, set the
storage type as `io1` and set `iops` to `2000`.
ifdef::vpc[]
<7> If you provide your own VPC, specify subnets for each availability zone that your cluster uses.
<8> The ID of the AMI used to boot machines for the cluster. If set, the AMI
must belong to the same region as the cluster.
<9> The AWS service endpoints. Custom endpoints are required when installing to
an unknown AWS region. The endpoint URL must use the `https` protocol and the
host must trust the certificate.
<10> Whether to enable or disable FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the {op-system-first} machines that {product-title} runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with {op-system} instead.
<11> You can optionally provide the `sshKey` value that you use to access the
machines in your cluster.

For production {product-title} clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your `ssh-agent` process uses.

ifdef::private[]
<12> How to publish the user-facing endpoints of your cluster. Set `publish` to `Internal` to deploy a private cluster, which cannot be accessed from the Internet. The default value is `External`.
