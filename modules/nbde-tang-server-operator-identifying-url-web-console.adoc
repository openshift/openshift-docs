= Identifying URL of the NBDE Tang Server Operator using the web console

You can identify the URLs of Tang servers deployed with the NBDE Tang Server Operator from the software catalog by using the {product-title} web console. After you identify the URLs, you use the `clevis luks bind` command on your clients containing LUKS-encrypted volumes that you want to unlock automatically by using keys advertised by the Tang servers. See the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/security_hardening/configuring-automated-unlocking-of-encrypted-volumes-using-policy-based-decryption_security-hardening#configuring-manual-enrollment-of-volumes-using-clevis_configuring-automated-unlocking-of-encrypted-volumes-using-policy-based-decryption[Configuring manual enrollment of LUKS-encrypted volumes] section in the RHEL 9 Security hardening document for detailed steps describing the configuration of clients with Clevis.

.Prerequisites

* You must have `cluster-admin` privileges on an {product-title} cluster.
* You deployed a Tang server by using the NBDE Tang Server Operator on your OpenShift cluster.

. The list of Tang servers deployed and available for your cluster appears. Click the name of the Tang server you want to bind with a Clevis client.

. The web console displays an overview of the selected Tang server. You can find the URL of your Tang server in the `Tang Server External Url` section of the screen:

In this example, the URL of the Tang server is `\http://34.28.173.205:7500`.

.Verification

* You can check that the Tang server is advertising by using `curl`, `wget`, or similar tools, for example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl 2> /dev/null http://34.28.173.205:7500/adv  | jq

.Example output
