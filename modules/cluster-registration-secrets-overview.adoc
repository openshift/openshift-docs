= Cluster registration secrets overview

[role="_abstract"]
A cluster registration secret (CRS) is a credential used to authenticate secured clusters with Central. You generate CRSes exclusively by using the `roxctl` CLI.

When you run the generation command, the CLI provides the CRS in the form of a YAML file. You must manage this file according to the following security considerations:

Irretrievability:: You cannot retrieve a previously generated CRS from Central. Central stores metadata about the CRS, but it does not retain the secret data itself. If you lose the generated file, you must generate a new CRS.
Secure storage:: Because the generated file contains sensitive secrets and cannot be recovered if lost, you must store it in a secure location.
Reusability:: You can use a single CRS file to configure and authenticate multiple secured clusters.

[NOTE]
====
You must have the `Admin` user role to generate a CRS.
