[id="oc-mirror-mirror-to-disk_{context}"]
= Mirroring from mirror-to-disk

You can use the oc-mirror plugin v1 to generate an image set and save the contents to disk. The generated image set can then be transferred to the disconnected environment and mirrored to the target registry.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Depending on the configuration specified in the image set configuration file, using oc-mirror to mirror images might download several hundreds of gigabytes of data to disk.

When configuring the mirror registry, the initial image set tends to be the largest. Subsequent uses of the oc-mirror plugin v1 result in smaller downloads, as only the changed images are retrieved since the last execution.
====

You must specify a storage backend in the image set configuration file. See "Setting up incremental mirroring".

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not delete or modify the metadata that is generated by the oc-mirror plugin v1. You must use the same storage backend every time you run the oc-mirror plugin v1 for the same mirror registry.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the internet to obtain the necessary container images.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have installed the `oc-mirror` CLI plugin v1.
* You have created the image set configuration file.
* You have set the umask parameter to `0022` on the operating system that uses oc-mirror plugin v1.
// TODO: Don't need a running cluster, but need some pull secrets. Sync w/ team on this

.Procedure

* Run the `oc mirror` command to mirror the images from the specified image set configuration to disk:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc mirror --config=./imageset-config.yaml \// <1>
  file://<path_to_output_directory>          <2>
----
<1> Pass in the image set configuration file that was created. This procedure assumes that it is named `imageset-config.yaml`.
<2> Specify the target directory where you want to output the image set file. The target directory path must start with `file://`.

.Verification

. Navigate to your output directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd <path_to_output_directory>
----

. Verify that an image set `.tar` file was created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ls
----
+
.Example output
[source,text]
----
mirror_seq1_000000.tar
----

.Next steps

* Transfer the image set .tar file to the disconnected environment.
