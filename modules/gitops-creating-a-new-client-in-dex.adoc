= Enabling the Dex OpenShift OAuth Connector

Dex is installed by default for all the Argo CD instances created by the Operator. You can configure {gitops-title} to use Dex as the SSO authentication provider by setting the `.spec.sso` parameter. 

Dex uses the users and groups defined within {product-title} by checking the `OAuth` server provided by the platform.

.Procedure

* To enable Dex, set the `.spec.sso.provider` parameter to `dex` in the YAML resource of the Operator:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  sso:
    provider: dex
    dex:
      openShiftOAuth: true <1>
# ...
----
<1> The `openShiftOAuth` property triggers the Operator to automatically configure the built-in {product-title} `OAuth` server when the value is set to `true`.
