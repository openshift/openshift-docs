= Network observability release notes 1.4.0 fixed issues

[role="_abstract"]
You can review the following fixed issues in the Network Observability Operator 1.4.0 release.

* Previously, the Prometheus metrics exported by network observability were computed out of potentially duplicated network flows. In the related dashboards, from *Observe* -> *Dashboards*, this could result in potentially doubled rates. Note that dashboards from the *Network Traffic* view were not affected. Now, network flows are filtered to eliminate duplicates before metrics calculation, which results in correct traffic rates displayed in the dashboards. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1131[*NETOBSERV-1131*])

* Previously, the Network Observability Operator agents were not able to capture traffic on network interfaces when configured with Multus or SR-IOV, non-default network namespaces. Now, all available network namespaces are recognized and used for capturing flows, allowing capturing traffic for SR-IOV. There are configurations needed for the `FlowCollector` and `SRIOVnetwork` custom resource to collect traffic. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1283[*NETOBSERV-1283*])

* Previously, in the Network Observability Operator details from *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*, the `FlowCollector` *Status* field might have reported incorrect information about the state of the deployment. The status field now shows the proper conditions with improved messages. The history of events is kept, ordered by event date. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1224[*NETOBSERV-1224*])

* Previously, during spikes of network traffic load, certain eBPF pods were OOM-killed and went into a `CrashLoopBackOff` state. Now, the `eBPF` agent memory footprint is improved, so pods are not OOM-killed and entering a `CrashLoopBackOff` state. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-975[*NETOBSERV-975*])

* Previously when `processor.metrics.tls` was set to `PROVIDED` the `insecureSkipVerify` option value was forced to be `true`. Now you can set `insecureSkipVerify` to `true` or `false`, and provide a CA certificate if needed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1087[NETOBSERV-1087])
