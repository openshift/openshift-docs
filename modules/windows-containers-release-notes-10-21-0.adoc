== Bug fixes

* Before this update, during secret reconciliations, secret change data was being added to the logs on each reconciliation loop. As a result, the secret change data was persisting, causing the logs to grow in size with unrelated data. With this release, only the current secret change data is being logged. As a result, the size and complexity of the logs is reduced. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-61122[*OCPBUGS-61122*])

* Before this update, the `hybridOverlay` service was not using the trusted CA bundle when connecting to {product-title}, because the `--k8s-cacert` option was missing from the service command. Because of this, users could encounter trust issues or failures when the `hybridOverlay` service attempted to communicate securely with {product-title} clusters using custom or internal CAs. With this release, the `hybridOverlay` service command now includes the `--k8s-cacert flag` pointing to the trusted CA bundle. As a result, the `hybridOverlay` service uses the trusted CA bundle for secure communication, preventing trust issues and ensuring compatibility with the cluster. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-64719[*OCPBUGS-64719*])

* Before this update, an error message regarding a cache not being started was being printed to the logs at WMCO start up. This error had no impact on functionality. The check causing the error message has been removed, and it will no longer log the error. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-62815[*OCPBUGS-62815*])
