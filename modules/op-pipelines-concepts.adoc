{pipelines-title} provide a set of standard Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that act as the building blocks from which you can assemble a CI/CD pipeline for your application.

Task:: A Task is the smallest configurable unit in a Pipeline. It is essentially a function of inputs and outputs that form the Pipeline build. It can run individually or as a part of a Pipeline. A Pipeline includes one or more Tasks, where each Task consists of one or more Steps. Steps are a series of commands that are sequentially executed by the Task.

Pipeline:: A Pipeline consists of a series of Tasks that are executed to construct complex workflows that automate the build, deployment, and delivery of applications. It is a collection of PipelineResources, parameters, and one or more Tasks. A Pipeline interacts with the outside world by using PipelineResources, which are added to Tasks as inputs and outputs.

PipelineRun:: A PipelineRun is the running instance of a Pipeline. A PipelineRun initiates a Pipeline and manages the creation of a TaskRun for each Task being executed in the Pipeline.

TaskRun:: A TaskRun is automatically created by a PipelineRun for each Task in a Pipeline. It is the result of running an instance of a Task in a Pipeline. It can also be manually created if a Task runs outside of a Pipeline.

PipelineResource:: A PipelineResource is an object that is used as an input and output for Pipeline Tasks. For example, if an input is a Git repository and an output is a container image built from that Git repository, these are both classified as PipelineResources. PipelineResources currently support Git resources, Image resources, Cluster resources, Storage Resources and CloudEvent resources.

Trigger:: A Trigger captures an external event, such as a Git pull request and processes the event payload to extract key pieces of information. This extracted information is then mapped to a set of predefined parameters, which trigger a series of tasks that may involve creation and deployment of Kubernetes resources. You can use Triggers along with Pipelines to create full-fledged CI/CD systems where the execution is defined entirely through Kubernetes resources.

Condition:: A Condition refers to a validation or check, which is executed before a Task is run in your Pipeline. Conditions are like `if` statements which perform logical tests, with a return value of `True` or `False`. A Task is executed if all Conditions return `True`, but if any of the Conditions fail, the Task and all subsequent Tasks are skipped. You can use Conditions in your Pipeline to create complex workflows covering multiple scenarios.
