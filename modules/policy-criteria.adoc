= Policy criteria

[role="_abstract"]
In the *Policy Criteria* section you can configure the data on which you want to trigger a policy.

You can configure the policy based on the attributes listed in the following table.

In this table:

* The *Regular expressions*, *AND, OR*, and *NOT* columns indicate whether you can use regular expressions and other logical operators along with the specific attribute.
** `!` in the *Regular expressions* column indicates that you can only use regular expressions for the listed fields.
** `!` in the *AND, OR* column indicates that you can only use the mentioned logical operator for the attribute.
* The *RHACS version* column indicates the version of {product-title} that you must have to use the attribute.
* You cannot use logical combination operators `AND` and `OR` for attributes that have:
** Boolean values `true` and `false`
** Minimum-value semantics, for example:
*** *Minimum RBAC permissions*
*** *Days since image was created*
* You cannot use the `NOT` logical operator for attributes that have:
** Boolean values `true` and `false`
** Numeric values that already use comparison, such as the `<`, `>`, `+<=+`, `>=` operators.
** Compound criteria that can have multiple values, for example:
*** *Dockerfile Line*, which includes both instructions and arguments.
*** *Environment Variable*, which consists of both name and value.
** Other meanings, including *Add Capabilities*, *Drop Capabilities*, *Days since image was created*, and *Days since image was last scanned*.

[NOTE]
====
To use logical operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` for creating security policies, you need {product-title} version 3.0.45 or newer.
However, on earlier versions you can still use regular expressions for the fields listed in the *Regular expressions* column.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using {product-title} version 3.0.44 or older, the policy criteria you specify in the *Policy criteria* section are "AND"ed.
It means that the violation only triggers if all the specified policy criteria match.
