= Policy criteria

[role="_abstract"]
In the *Policy Criteria* section you can configure the data on which you want to trigger a policy.

You can configure the policy based on the attributes listed in the following table.

In this table:

* The *Regular expressions*, *AND, OR*, and *NOT* columns indicate whether you can use regular expressions and other logical operators along with the specific attribute.
** `!` for *Regex* (Regular expressions) indicates that you can only use regular expressions for the listed fields.
** `!` for *AND*, or *OR* indicates that you can only use the mentioned logical operator for the attribute.
** ✕ in the *Regex* / *NOT* / *AND, OR* column indicates that the attribute does not support any of those (regex, negation, logical operators).
* The *{product-title-short} version* column indicates the version of {product-title} that you must have to use the attribute.
* You cannot use logical combination operators `AND` and `OR` for attributes that have:
** Boolean values `true` and `false`
** Minimum-value semantics, for example:
*** *Minimum RBAC permissions*
*** *Days since image was created*
* You cannot use the `NOT` logical operator for attributes that have:
** Boolean values `true` and `false`
** Numeric values that already use comparison, such as the `<`, `>`, `+<=+`, `>=` operators.
** Compound criteria that can have multiple values, for example:
*** *Dockerfile Line*, which includes both instructions and arguments.
*** *Environment Variable*, which consists of both name and value.
** Other meanings, including *Add Capabilities*, *Drop Capabilities*, *Days since image was created*, and *Days since image was last scanned*.

6+| *Section: Container configuration*

| Environment Variable
| Check environment variables by name or value. When you create a policy that includes the environment variable attribute,
you can choose which types of environment variables the policy should match. For example, you can specify raw values, which are provided directly in the deployment YAML, or you can specify references to values from config maps, secrets, fields, or resource requests or limits.
For any type other than a raw value specified directly in the deployment YAML, the corresponding `value` attribute of the policy rule is ignored. In this case, the policy match is evaluated on the existence of the specified environment variable type. Additionally, this criteria disallows the creation of policies with a non-empty `value` attribute for types other than raw values.
| Environment Variable
a| RAW=key=value to match an environment variable as directly specified in the deployment YAML with a specific key and value. You can omit the `value` attribute to match on only the key. +

If the environment variable is not defined in the configuration YAML, then you can use the format `SOURCE=KEY`, where `SOURCE` is one of the following objects:

* SECRET_KEY (SecretKeyRef)
* CONFIG_MAP_KEY (ConfigMapRef)
* FIELD (FieldRef)
* RESOURCE_FIELD (ResourceFieldRef)

The preceding list provides the API object label first, and then provides the user interface label in parentheses.
