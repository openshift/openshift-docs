= Disabling the admission controller for policies

[role="_abstract"]
You can turn off the enforcement on relevant policies, which in turn instructs the admission controller to skip enforcements.
//is this correct? It doesn't seem right.

.Procedure
. In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Platform Configuration* -> *Policy Management*.
. Disable enforcement on the default policies that you do not want to enforce. For example:
** In the policies view, click the *Kubernetes Actions: Exec into Pod* policy. Selection *Actions* -> *Disable policy*.
