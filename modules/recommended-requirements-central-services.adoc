= Central services (self-managed)

[NOTE]
====
If you are using {rh-rhacscs-first}, you do not need to review the requirements for Central services, because they are managed by Red{nbsp}Hat. You only need to look at the requirements for secured cluster services.
====

Central services contain the following components:

* Central
* Central DB
* StackRox Scanner
* Scanner V4
