= Network Observability Operator release notes 1.9.0 notable technical changes

[role="_abstract"]
You can review the notable technical changes for the Network Observability Operator 1.6.0 release.

* The `NetworkEvents` feature in network observability 1.9 has been updated to work with the newer Linux kernel of {product-title} 4.19. This update breaks compatibility with older kernels. As a result, the `NetworkEvents` feature can only be used with {product-title} 4.19. If you are using this feature with network observability 1.8 and {product-title} 4.18, consider avoiding a network observability upgrade or upgrade to network observability 1.9 and {product-title} to 4.19.

* The `netobserv-reader` cluster role has been renamed to `netobserv-loki-reader`.

* Improved CPU performance of the eBPF agents.
