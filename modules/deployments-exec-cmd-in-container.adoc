= Executing commands inside a container

You can add a command to a container, which modifies the container's startup behavior by overruling the image's `ENTRYPOINT`. This is different from a lifecycle hook, which instead can be run once per deployment at a specified time.

.Procedure

. Add the `command` parameters to the `spec` field of the `DeploymentConfig` object. You can also add an `args` field, which modifies the `command` (or the `ENTRYPOINT` if `command` does not exist).

For example, to execute the `java` command with the `-jar` and `/opt/app-root/springboots2idemo.jar` arguments:
