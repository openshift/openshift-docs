= Executing commands inside a container

You can add a command to a container, which modifies the container's startup
behavior by overruling the image's `ENTRYPOINT`. This is different from a
lifecycle hook, which instead can be run once per deployment at a specified
time.

.Procedure

. Add the `command` parameters to the `spec` field of the DeploymentConfig. You
can also add an `args` field, which modifies the `command` (or the `ENTRYPOINT`
if `command` does not exist).

  containers:
    -
    name: <container_name>
    image: 'image'
    command:

    args:
      - '<argument_1>'
      - '<argument_2>'

For example, to execute the `java` command with the `-jar` and
`/opt/app-root/springboots2idemo.jar` arguments:
