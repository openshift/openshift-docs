= Event delivery behavior for Knative Eventing channels

Different Knative Eventing channel types have their own behavior patterns that are followed for event delivery. Developers can set event delivery parameters in the subscription configuration to ensure that any events that fail to be delivered from channels to an event sink are retried. You must also configure a dead letter sink for subscriptions if you want to provide a sink where events that are not eventually delivered can be stored, otherwise undelivered events are dropped.

== Event delivery behavior for Knative Kafka channels

If an event is successfully delivered to a Kafka channel or broker receiver, the receiver responds with a `202` status code, which means that the event has been safely stored inside a Kafka topic and is not lost. If the receiver responds with any other status code, the event is not safely stored, and steps must be taken by the user to resolve this issue.

[id="serverless-event-delivery-component-behaviors-status-codes_{context}"]
== Delivery failure status codes

The channel or broker receiver can respond with the following status codes if an event fails to be delivered:

`500`:: This is a generic status code which means that the event was not delivered successfully.
`404`:: This status code means that the channel or broker the event is being delivered to does not exist, or that the `Host` header is incorrect.
`400`:: This status code means that the event being sent to the receiver is invalid.
