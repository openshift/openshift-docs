= Configuring MetalLB with a BGP advertisement and an advanced use case

Configure MetalLB as follows so that MetalLB assigns IP addresses to load-balancer services in the ranges between `203.0.113.200` and `203.0.113.203` and between `fc00:f853:ccd:e799::0` and `fc00:f853:ccd:e799::f`.

To explain the two BGP advertisements, consider an instance when MetalLB assigns the IP address of `203.0.113.200` to a service.
With that IP address as an example, the speaker advertises two routes to BGP peers:

* `203.0.113.200/32`, with `localPref` set to `100` and the community set to the numeric value of the `NO_ADVERTISE` community.
This specification indicates to the peer routers that they can use this route but they should not propagate information about this route to BGP peers.

* `203.0.113.200/30`, aggregates the load-balancer IP addresses assigned by MetalLB into a single route.
MetalLB advertises the aggregated route to BGP peers with the community attribute set to `8000:800`.
BGP peers propagate the `203.0.113.200/30` route to other BGP peers.
When traffic is routed to a node with a speaker, the `203.0.113.200/32` route is used to forward the traffic into the cluster and to a pod that is associated with the service.

As you add more services and MetalLB assigns more load-balancer IP addresses from the pool, peer routers receive one local route, `203.0.113.20x/32`, for each service, as well as the `203.0.113.200/30` aggregate route.
Each service that you add generates the `/30` route, but MetalLB deduplicates the routes to one BGP advertisement before communicating with peer routers.
