= Overriding Knative Serving system deployment configurations

You can override the default configurations for some specific deployments by modifying the `deployments` spec in the `KnativeServing` custom resource (CR). Currently, overriding default configuration settings is supported for the `resources`, `replicas`, `labels`, `annotations`, and `nodeSelector` fields.

In the following example, a `KnativeServing` CR overrides the `webhook` deployment so that:

* The deployment has specified CPU and memory resource limits.
* The deployment has 3 replicas.
* The `example-label: label` label is added.
* The `example-annotation: annotation` annotation is added.
* The `nodeSelector` field is set to select nodes with the `disktype: hdd` label.

[NOTE]
====
The `KnativeServing` CR label and annotation settings override the deployment's labels and annotations for both the deployment itself and the resulting pods.
