= Overriding system deployment configurations

You can override the default configurations for some specific deployments by modifying the `deployments` spec in the `KnativeServing` custom resource (CR).

Currently, overriding default configuration settings for the `replicas`, `labels`, `annotations`, and `nodeSelector` fields are supported.

In the following example, a `KnativeServing` CR overrides the `webhook` deployment so that:

* The deployment has 3 replicas.
* The label is set to `example-label: label`.
* The label `example-label: label` is added.
* The `nodeSelector` field is set to select nodes with the `disktype: hdd` label.

[NOTE]
====
The `KnativeServing` CR label and annotation settings override the deployment's labels and annotations for both the deployment itself and the resulting pods.
