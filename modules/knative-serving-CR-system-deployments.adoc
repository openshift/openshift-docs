= Overriding Knative Serving system deployment configurations

You can override the default configurations for some specific deployments by modifying the `deployments` spec in the `KnativeServing` custom resource (CR). Currently, overriding default configuration settings is supported for the `resources`, `replicas`, `labels`, `annotations`, and `nodeSelector` fields, as well as for the `readiness` and `liveness` fields for probes.

In the following example, a `KnativeServing` CR overrides the `webhook` deployment so that:

* The `readiness` probe timeout for `net-kourier-controller` is set to be 10 seconds.
* The deployment has specified CPU and memory resource limits.
* The deployment has 3 replicas.
* The `example-label: label` label is added.
* The `example-annotation: annotation` annotation is added.
* The `nodeSelector` field is set to select nodes with the `disktype: hdd` label.

[NOTE]
====
The `KnativeServing` CR label and annotation settings override the deployment's labels and annotations for both the deployment itself and the resulting pods.

<1> You can use the `readiness` and `liveness` probe overrides to override all fields of a probe in a container of a deployment as specified in the Kubernetes API except for the fields related to the probe handler: `exec`, `grpc`, `httpGet`, and `tcpSocket`.
