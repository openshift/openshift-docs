= Custom metric categories

You can enable specific Prometheus metrics that you want to expose on the `/metrics` path of the central API endpoint.

The following table lists the available metric categories, their configurability, and default status:

.Metric category and configuration status
[cols="2,2,2",options="header"]
|===
| Metric category | Configurable | Default status

| Image vulnerabilities
| Yes
| Disabled by default

| Node vulnerabilities
| Yes
| Disabled by default

| Policy violations
| Yes
| Disabled by default

| Total policy numbers
| No
| Enabled by default

| Cluster health
| No
| Enabled by default

| Certificate expiry
| No
| Enabled by default

|===

Each category is configured with a data gathering period and a list of metrics. A metric is associated with a set of labels.

[NOTE]
====
The `/metrics` path is accessible for API tokens with Administration resource view permissions. The value of the labels are subject to scoped access control.
