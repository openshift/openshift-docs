= Advanced configuration for the log forwarder

Cluster logging includes multiple Fluentd parameters that you can use for tuning the performance of the Fluentd log forwarder. With these parameters, you can change the following Fluentd behaviors:

* the size of Fluentd chunks and chunk buffer
* the Fluentd chunk flushing behavior
* the Fluentd chunk forwarding retry behavior

Fluentd collects log data in a single blob called a _chunk_. When Fluentd creates a chunk, the chunk is considered to be in the _stage_, where the chunk gets filled with data. When the chunk is full, Fluentd moves the chunk to the _queue_, where chunks are held before being flushed, or written out to their destination. Fluentd can fail to flush a chunk for a number of reasons, such as network issues or capacity issues at the destination. If a chunk cannot be flushed, Fluentd retries flushing as configured.

By default in {product-title}, Fluentd uses the _exponential backoff_ method to retry flushing, where Fluentd doubles the time it waits between attempts to retry flushing again, which helps reduce connection requests to the destination. You can disable exponential backoff and use the _periodic_ retry method instead, which retries flushing the chunks at a specified interval. By default, Fluentd retries chunk flushing indefinitely. In {product-title}, you cannot change the indefinite retry behavior.

These parameters can help you determine the trade-offs between latency and throughput.

* To optimize Fluentd for throughput, you could use these parameters to reduce network packet count by configuring larger buffers and queues, delaying flushes, and setting longer times between retries. Be aware that larger buffers require more space on the node file system.

* To optimize for low latency, you could use the parameters to send data as soon as possible, avoid the build-up of batches, have shorter queues and buffers, and use more frequent flush and retries.

You can configure the chunking and flushing behavior using the following parameters in the Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR). The parameters are then automatically added to the Fluentd ConfigMap for use by Fluentd.

[NOTE]
====
These parameters are:

* Not relevant to most users. The default settings should give good general performance.
* Only for advanced users with detailed knowledge of Fluentd configuration and performance.
* Only for performance tuning. They have no effect on functional aspects of logging.

.Advanced Fluentd Configuration Parameters
[options="header"]
|===

|Parmeter |Description |Default

|`chunkLimitSize`
|The maximum size of each chunk. Fluentd stops writing data to a chunk when it reaches this size. Then, Fluentd sends the chunk to the queue and opens a new chunk.
|`8m`

|`totalLimitSize`
|The maximum size of the buffer, which is the total size of the stage and the queue. If the buffer size exceeds this value, Fluentd stops adding data to chunks and fails with an error. All data not in chunks is lost.
|`8G`

|`flushInterval`
|The interval between chunk flushes. You can use `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), or `d` (days).
|`1s`

|`flushMode`
a| The method to perform flushes:

* `lazy`: Flush chunks based on the `timekey` parameter. You cannot modify the `timekey` parameter.
* `interval`: Flush chunks based on the `flushInterval` parameter.
* `immediate`: Flush chunks immediately after data is added to a chunk.
|`interval`

|`flushThreadCount`
|The number of threads that perform chunk flushing. Increasing the number of threads improves the flush throughput, which hides network latency.
|`2`

|`overflowAction`
a|The chunking behavior when the queue is full:

* `throw_exception`: Raise an exception to show in the log.
* `block`: Stop data chunking until the full buffer issue is resolved.
* `drop_oldest_chunk`: Drop the oldest chunk to accept new incoming chunks. Older chunks have less value than newer chunks.
|`block`

|`queuedChunkLimitSize`
|The number of chunks in the queue.
|`32`

|`retryMaxInterval`
|The maximum time in seconds for the `exponential_backoff` retry method.
|`300s`

|`retryType`
a|The retry method when flushing fails:

* `exponential_backoff`: Increase the time between flush retries. Fluentd doubles the time it waits until the next retry until the `retry_max_interval` parameter is reached.
* `periodic`: Retries flushes periodically, based on the `retryWait` parameter.
|`exponential_backoff`

|`retryWait`
|The time in seconds before the next chunk flush.
|`1s`
