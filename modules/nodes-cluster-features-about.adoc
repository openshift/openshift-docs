= Understanding feature gates and feature sets

You can use the Feature Gate Custom Resource to enable specific
feature sets throughout your cluster. 

This allows you, for example, to enable Technology Preview features on test clusters where you can fully test them while
ensuring they are disabled on production clusters.

////
If you disable a feature that appears in the web console, you might see that feature, but
no objects are listed. For example, if you disable builds, you can see the *Builds* tab in the web console, but there are no builds present.

If you attempt to use commands associated with a disabled feature, such as `oc start-build`, {product-title}
displays an error.

[NOTE]
====
If you disable a feature that any application in the cluster relies on, the application might not
function properly, depending upon the feature disabled and how the application uses that feature.
