= {product-title} Upgrade Channels and Releases

In {product-title} 4.1, Red Hat introduced the concept of channels for
recommending the appropriate release versions for cluster upgrade. By controlling
the pace of upgrades, these upgrade channels allow users to choose an upgrade
strategy. Upgrade channels are tied to a minor version of
{product-title}. For instance, {product-title} {product-version}
upgrade channels will never include an upgrade to a 4.5 release. This ensures
administrators make an explicit decision to upgrade to the next minor version of
{product-title}. Upgrade channels only control release selection and have
no impact on the version of the cluster you install; the `openshift-install`
binary for a given patch level of {product-title} always installs that patch level.

{product-title} {product-version} has the following upgrade channels to choose from:

* candidate-{product-version}
* fast-{product-version}
* stable-{product-version}

[discrete]
== candidate-{product-version} Channel

The candidate-{product-version} channel will contain candidate builds for a z-stream
({product-version}.z) release.
Release candidates contain all the features of the product but they are not supported and
should only be used to test feature acceptance and assist in qualifying the next version
of {product-title}.
A release candidate is any build (e.g. 4.3.0-rc.3, 4.3.0) that is available in the candidate
channel.
After a version lands in the candidate channel, it goes through more quality checks and if
it meets the quality standard it is promoted to fast-{product-version} or stable-{product-version}
channels.
So if a given release is available in the candidate-{product-version} channel and also in the fast-{product-version}
or stable-{product-version} channels, it is a Red Hat supported version.
Additionally candidate-{product-version} may include dead end releases from which there are no or ever
be recommended upgrades.

The candidate-{product-version} channel also allows upgrading from a previous minor version of
{product-title} to {product-version}.

[NOTE]
====
Release candidates differ from the nightly builds found on try.openshift.com. Nightly
builds are available for early access to features but updating to or from nightly
builds is neither recommended nor supported. Nightly builds are not avilable in
any upgrade channel.

[discrete]
== fast-{product-version} Channel

The fast-{product-version} channel is updated with new {product-version} patch
versions as soon as Red Hat declares the given patch as a general availability
release. As such, these releases are fully supported, are production quality and have
performed well while available as a release candidate in the candidate-{product-version}
channel from where they were promoted. Some time after a release appears in
fast-{product-version} it will also appear in stable-{product-version}. Releases will
never appear in stable-{product-version} before they appear in fast-{product-version}.

The fast-{product-version} channel also allows upgrading from a previous minor version of
{product-title}.

[discrete]
== stable-{product-version} Channel

Like the fast-{product-version} channel, the stable-{product-version} channel will
only contain releases that have been declared general availability are therefore
fully supported. However the stable-{product-version} channel will gradually roll out
releases to customers based on data from our SRE teams, support services, and
pre-production and production environments that participate in our connected customer
program, rather than being immediately available as they are in the fast-{product-version}
channel. For patch and CVE fixes this delay can range from several hours to a day
and allows an extra period of assessment in how the software performs.

The stable-{product-version} channel also allows upgrading from a previous minor version of
{product-title}.

[discrete]
== Upgrade Version Paths

{product-title} maintains an upgrade recommendation service that understands the
version of {product-title} you have installed as well as the path to take within
the channel you choose to get you to the next release. You can imagine seeing the
following in the fast-{product-version} channel:

* {product-version}.0
* {product-version}.1
* {product-version}.3
* {product-version}.4

The service only recommends upgrades that have been tested and have no serious issues.
If you are on {product-version}.1 and {product-title} is allowing you to select
{product-version}.4, then it is safe for you to go from .{product-version}.1 to .{product-version}.4. Likewise,
the absence of {product-version}.2 may be due to a CVE that was fixed in {product-version}.3 and Red Hat no
longer suggests upgrading to a known vulnerable version.

Update stability depends on your channel. The presence of an update recommendation in
the candidate-{product-version} channel does not imply that the update is supported.
It means that no serious issues have been found with the update yet, but there may
not be significant traffic through the update to suggest stability. The presence of
an update recommendation in the fast-{product-version} or stable-{product-version}
channels is a declaration that the update is fully supported while it is in the
channel. While releases will never be removed from a channel, update recommendations
which exhibit serious issues will be removed from all channels. Updates initiated
after the update recommendation has been removed may not be supported.

Red Hat will eventually provide supported update paths from any supported (fast-{product-version}
or stable-{product-version}) release to the latest release in {product-version}.z,
although there may be delays while safe paths away from troubled releases are
constructed and verified.

== Fast and Stable Channel Usage and Strategies

The fast-{product-version} and stable-{product-version} channels present a choice between receiving
general availability releases as soon as they are available or allowing Red Hat to
control the rollout of those updates. If issues are detected during rollout or at a
later time, upgrades to that version may be blocked in both the fast-{product-version} and
stable-{product-version} channels, and a new version may be introduced that will be the new
preferred upgrade target.

Customers can improve this process by configuring pre-production systems on the
fast-{product-version} channel, production systems on the stable-{product-version} channel,
and participating in Red Hatâ€™s xref:../support/remote_health_monitoring/about-remote-health-monitoring.adoc[connected customer program]. This program allows Red
Hat to observe the impact of updates on your specific hardware and software
configurations. Future releases may improve or alter the pace at which updates move
from the fast-{product-version} to the stable-{product-version} channel.

[discrete]
== Restricted Network Clusters

Customers who have chosen to not be connected to Red Hat and are controlling their
own {product-title} container image content manually should consult the Red Hat
errata associated with product releases and note any comments impacting upgrades.
During upgrade the user interface may caution about switching between these versions
and it is up to the customer to ensure they have correctly selected the appropriate
version before bypassing those cautions.

[discrete]
== Switching Between Channels

It is supported for customers to switch from the stable-{product-version} channel to
the fast-{product-version} at any time. Customers can also switch to the
candidate-{product-version} at any time but should be aware that some releases in the
candidate-{product-version} channel may be release candidates and therefore not
supported. A customer can switch from candidate-{product-version} to fast-{product-version}
if their current release is a general availability release. Customers can always
switch from fast-{product-version} to stable-{product-version}, although there may
be a delay of up to a day if their current release was recently promoted to
fast-{product-stable} while they wait for the release to be promoted to
stable-{product-version}. If you change to a channel that does not include your
current release, an alert will fire, no updates will be recommended, and you can
safely change back to your original channel at any point.

Please refer to the <<candidate-{product-version} Channel>> section above to understand the
distinction between a release candidate and a general avilability release.
