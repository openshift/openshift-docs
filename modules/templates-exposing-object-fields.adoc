= Exposing template object fields

Template authors can indicate that fields of particular objects in a template should be exposed. The {tsb-name} recognizes exposed fields on `ConfigMap`, `Secret`, `Service`, and `Route` objects, and returns the values of the exposed fields when a user binds a service backed by the broker.

To expose one or more fields of an object, add annotations prefixed by `template.openshift.io/expose-` or `template.openshift.io/base64-expose-` to the object in the template.

Each annotation key, with its prefix removed, is passed through to become a key in a `bind` response.

Each annotation value is a Kubernetes JSONPath expression, which is resolved at bind time to indicate the object field whose value should be returned in the `bind` response.

[NOTE]
====
`Bind` response key-value pairs can be used in other parts of the system as environment variables. Therefore, it is recommended that every annotation key with its prefix removed should be a valid environment variable name -- beginning with a character `A-Z`, `a-z`, or `pass:[_]`, and being followed by zero or more characters `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, or `pass:[_]`.
====

[NOTE]
====
Unless escaped with a backslash, Kubernetes' JSONPath implementation interprets characters such as `.`, `@`, and others as metacharacters, regardless of their position in the expression. Therefore, for example, to refer to a `ConfigMap` datum named `my.key`, the required JSONPath expression would be `{.data['my\.key']}`. Depending on how the JSONPath expression is then written in YAML, an additional backslash might be required, for example `"{.data['my\\.key']}"`.
====

The following is an example of different objects' fields being exposed:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: Template
apiVersion: template.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  name: my-template
objects:
- kind: ConfigMap
  apiVersion: v1
  metadata:
    name: my-template-config
    annotations:
      template.openshift.io/expose-username: "{.data['my\\.username']}"
  data:
    my.username: foo
- kind: Secret
  apiVersion: v1
  metadata:
    name: my-template-config-secret
    annotations:
      template.openshift.io/base64-expose-password: "{.data['password']}"
  stringData:
    password: bar
- kind: Service
  apiVersion: v1
  metadata:
    name: my-template-service
    annotations:
      template.openshift.io/expose-service_ip_port: "{.spec.clusterIP}:{.spec.ports[?(.name==\"web\")].port}"
  spec:
    ports:
    - name: "web"
      port: 8080
- kind: Route
  apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
  metadata:
    name: my-template-route
    annotations:
      template.openshift.io/expose-uri: "http://{.spec.host}{.spec.path}"
  spec:
    path: mypath
----

An example response to a `bind` operation given the above partial template follows:

[source,json]
----
{
  "credentials": {
    "username": "foo",
    "password": "YmFy",
    "service_ip_port": "172.30.12.34:8080",
    "uri": "http://route-test.router.default.svc.cluster.local/mypath"
  }
}
----

.Procedure

* Use the `template.openshift.io/expose-` annotation to return the field value as a string. This is convenient, although it does not handle arbitrary binary data.

* If you want to return binary data, use the `template.openshift.io/base64-expose-` annotation instead to base64 encode the data before it is returned.
