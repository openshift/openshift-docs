= Creating scrape sample alerts

You can create alerts that notify you when:

* The target cannot be scraped or is not available for the specified `for` duration
* A scrape sample threshold is reached or is exceeded for the specified `for` duration

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role, or as a user with the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.
* You have enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have created the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* You have limited the number of samples that can be accepted per target scrape in user-defined projects, by using `enforcedSampleLimit`.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file with alerts that inform you when the targets are down and when the enforced sample limit is approaching. The file in this example is called `monitoring-stack-alerts.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1

metadata:
  labels:
    prometheus: k8s
    role: alert-rules
  name: monitoring-stack-alerts <1>
  namespace: ns1 <2>

        message: '{{ printf "%.4g" $value }}% of the {{ $labels.job }}/{{ $labels.service
          }} targets in {{ $labels.namespace }} namespace are down.' <4>
      expr: 100 * (count(up == 0) BY (job, namespace, service) / count(up) BY (job,
        namespace, service)) > 10
      for: 10m <5>
      labels:
        severity: warning <6>
    - alert: ApproachingEnforcedSamplesLimit <7>
      annotations:
        message: '{{ $labels.container }} container of the {{ $labels.pod }} pod in the {{ $labels.namespace }} namespace consumes {{ $value | humanizePercentage }} of the samples limit budget.' <8>
      expr: scrape_samples_scraped/50000 > 0.8 <9>
      for: 10m <10>
      labels:
        severity: warning <11>
----
<1> Defines the name of the alerting rule.
<2> Specifies the user-defined project where the alerting rule will be deployed.
<3> The `TargetDown` alert will fire if the target cannot be scraped or is not available for the `for` duration.
<4> The message that will be output when the `TargetDown` alert fires.
<5> The conditions for the `TargetDown` alert must be true for this duration before the alert is fired.
<6> Defines the severity for the `TargetDown` alert.
<7> The `ApproachingEnforcedSamplesLimit` alert will fire when the defined scrape sample threshold is reached or exceeded for the specified `for` duration.
<8> The message that will be output when the `ApproachingEnforcedSamplesLimit` alert fires.
<9> The threshold for the `ApproachingEnforcedSamplesLimit` alert. In this example the alert will fire when the number of samples per target scrape has exceeded 80% of the enforced sample limit of `50000`. The `for` duration must also have passed before the alert will fire. The number in the expression `scrape_samples_scraped/<number> > <threshold>`, `<number>` must match the `enforcedSampleLimit` value defined in the `user-workload-monitoring-config` ConfigMap.
<10> The conditions for the `ApproachingEnforcedSamplesLimit` alert must be true for this duration before the alert is fired.
<11> Defines the severity for the `ApproachingEnforcedSamplesLimit` alert.

. Apply the configuration to the user-defined project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f monitoring-stack-alerts.yaml
