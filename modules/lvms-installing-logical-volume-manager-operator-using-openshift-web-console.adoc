= Installing {lvms} using {product-title} Web Console

You can install {lvms} using the Red Hat {product-title} OperatorHub.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the {sno} cluster.
* You are using an account with the `cluster-admin` and Operator installation permissions.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} Web Console.
. Click *Operators -> OperatorHub*.
. Scroll or type `LVM Storage` into the *Filter by keyword* box to find {lvms}.
. Click *Install*.
. Set the following options on the *Install Operator* page:
.. *Update Channel* as *stable-{product-version}*.
.. *Installation Mode* as *A specific namespace on the cluster*.
.. *Installed Namespace* as *Operator recommended namespace openshift-storage*.
   If the `openshift-storage` namespace does not exist, it is created during the operator installation.
.. *Approval Strategy* as *Automatic* or *Manual*.
+
If you select *Automatic* updates, then the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator without any intervention.
+
If you select *Manual* updates, then the OLM creates an update request.
As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve that update request to update the Operator to a newer version.

. Click *Install*.

.Verification steps

* Verify that {lvms} shows a green tick, indicating successful installation.
