= Using a custom VPC

In {product-title} {product-version}, you can deploy a cluster into existing subnets in an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in the Alibaba Cloud Platform. By deploying {product-title} into an existing Alibaba VPC, you can avoid limit constraints in new accounts and more easily adhere to your organization's operational constraints. If you cannot obtain the infrastructure creation permissions that are required to create the VPC yourself, use this installation option. You must configure networking using vSwitches.

[id="installation-custom-alibaba-vpc-requirements_{context}"]
== Requirements for using your VPC

The union of the VPC CIDR block and the machine network CIDR must be non-empty. The vSwitches must be within the machine network.

The installation program does not create the following components:

* VPC
* vSwitches
* Route table
* NAT gateway

[id="installation-custom-alibaba-vpc-validation_{context}"]
== VPC validation

To ensure that the vSwitches you provide are suitable, the installation program confirms the following data:

* All the vSwitches that you specify must exist.
* You have provided one or more vSwitches for control plane machines and compute machines.
* The vSwitches' CIDRs belong to the machine CIDR that you specified.

[id="installation-about-custom-alibaba-permissions_{context}"]
== Division of permissions

Some individuals can create different resources in your cloud than others. For example, you might be able to create application-specific items, like instances, buckets, and load balancers, but not networking-related components, such as VPCs or vSwitches.

[id="installation-custom-alibaba-vpc-isolation_{context}"]
== Isolation between clusters

If you deploy {product-title} into an existing network, the isolation of cluster services is reduced in the following ways:

* You can install multiple {product-title} clusters in the same VPC.

* ICMP ingress is allowed to the entire network.

* TCP 22 ingress (SSH) is allowed to the entire network.

* Control plane TCP 6443 ingress (Kubernetes API) is allowed to the entire network.

* Control plane TCP 22623 ingress (MCS) is allowed to the entire network.
