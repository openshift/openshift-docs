= Shared responsibilities for {product-title}


While Red{nbsp}Hat and Amazon Web Services (AWS) manage the {product-title} services, the customer shares certain responsibilities. The {product-title} services are accessed remotely, hosted on public cloud resources, created in customer-owned AWS accounts, and have underlying platform and data security that is owned by Red{nbsp}Hat.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the `cluster-admin` role is added to a user, see the responsibilities and exclusion notes in the link:https://www.redhat.com/en/about/agreements[Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Agreement Appendix 4 (Online Subscription Services)].
