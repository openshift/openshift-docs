= Creating a NodePool object for the hosted cluster

A `NodePool` is a scalable set of worker nodes that is associated with a hosted cluster. `NodePool` machine architectures remain consistent within a specific pool and are independent of the machine architecture of the control plane.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file with the following information about the `NodePool` object, replacing values as necessary:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: hypershift.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: NodePool
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: <hosted_cluster_name> \//
  namespace: <hosted_cluster_namespace> \//
spec:
  arch: amd64
  clusterName: <hosted_cluster_name>
  management:
    autoRepair: false \//
    upgradeType: InPlace \//
  nodeDrainTimeout: 0s
  platform:
    type: Agent
  release:
    image: registry.<dns.base.domain.name>:5000/openshift/release-images:4.x.y-x86_64 \//
  replicas: 2 //
status:
  replicas: 2

where:

name: <hosted_cluster_name>:: Replace `<hosted_cluster_name>` with your hosted cluster.
namespace: <hosted_cluster_namespace>:: Replace `<hosted_cluster_namespace>` with the name of your hosted cluster namespace.
autoRepair: false:: The `autoRepair` field is set to `false` because the node will not be re-created if it is removed.
upgradeType: InPlace:: The `upgradeType` is set to `InPlace`, which indicates that the same bare metal node is reused during an upgrade.
image: registry.<dns.base.domain.name>:5000/openshift/release-images:4.x.y-x86_64:: All of the nodes included in this `NodePool` are based on the following {product-title} version: `4.x.y-x86_64`. Replace the `<dns.base.domain.name>` value with your DNS base domain name and the `4.x.y` value with the supported {product-title} version you want to use.
replicas: 2:: You can set the `replicas` value to `2` to create two node pool replicas in your hosted cluster.

. Create the `NodePool` object by entering the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f 02-nodepool.yaml
