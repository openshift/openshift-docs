= Deleting platform Operators

As a cluster administrator, you can delete existing platform Operators. Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) performs a cascading deletion. First, OLM removes the bundle deployment for the platform Operator, which then deletes any objects referenced in the `registry+v1` type bundle.

[NOTE]
====
The platform Operator manager and bundle deployment provisioner only manage objects that are referenced in the bundle, but not objects subsequently deployed by any bundle workloads themselves. For example, if a bundle workload creates a namespace and the Operator is not configured to clean it up before the Operator is removed, it is outside of the scope of OLM to remove the namespace during platform Operator deletion.

.Procedure

. Get a list of installed platform Operators and find the name for the Operator you want to delete:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get platformoperator
----

. Delete the `PlatformOperator` resource for the chosen Operator, for example, for the Quay Operator:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete platformoperator quay-operator
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
platformoperator.platform.openshift.io "quay-operator" deleted
----

.Verification

. Verify the namespace for the platform Operator is eventually deleted, for example, for the Quay Operator:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get ns quay-operator-system
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Error from server (NotFound): namespaces "quay-operator-system" not found
----

. Verify the `platform-operators-aggregated` cluster Operator continues to report an `Available=True` status:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get co platform-operators-aggregated
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
