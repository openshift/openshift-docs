= Firmware requirements for installing with virtual media

The installation program for installer-provisioned {product-title} clusters validates the hardware and firmware compatibility with Redfish virtual media. The installation program does not begin installation on a node if the node firmware is not compatible. The following tables list the minimum firmware versions tested and verified to work for installer-provisioned {product-title} clusters deployed by using Redfish virtual media.
