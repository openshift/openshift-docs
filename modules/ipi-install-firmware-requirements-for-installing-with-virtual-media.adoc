= Firmware requirements for installing with virtual media

The installation program for installer-provisioned {product-title} clusters validates the hardware and firmware compatibility with Redfish virtual media. The installation program does not begin installation on a node if the node firmware is not compatible. The following tables list the minimum firmware versions tested and verified to work for installer-provisioned {product-title} clusters deployed by using Redfish virtual media.

For information about updating the firmware, see the hardware documentation for the nodes or contact the hardware vendor.

[NOTE]
====

For Dell servers, ensure the {product-title} cluster nodes have *AutoAttach* enabled through the iDRAC console. The menu path is *Configuration* -> *Virtual Media* -> *Attach Mode* -> *AutoAttach* . With iDRAC 9 firmware version `04.40.00.00` and all releases up to including the `5.xx` series, the virtual console plugin defaults to eHTML5, an enhanced version of HTML5, which causes problems with the *InsertVirtualMedia* workflow. Set the plugin to use HTML5 to avoid this issue. The menu path is *Configuration* -> *Virtual console* -> *Plug-in Type* -> *HTML5* .
