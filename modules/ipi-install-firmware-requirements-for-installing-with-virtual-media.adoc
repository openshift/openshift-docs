= Firmware requirements for installing with virtual media

The installer for installer-provisioned {product-title} clusters validates the hardware and firmware compatibility with Redfish virtual media. The following table lists the minimum firmware versions tested and verified to work for installer-provisioned {product-title} clusters deployed by using Redfish virtual media.

.Firmware compatibility for Redfish virtual media
[frame="topbot", options="header"]
|====
|Hardware| Model | Management | Firmware versions
| HP | 10th Generation | iLO5 | 2.63 or later

.2+| Dell | 14th Generation | iDRAC 9 | v4.20.20.20 - v4.40.00.00 only

| 13th Generation .2+| iDRAC 8 | v2.75.75.75 or later

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat does not test every combination of firmware, hardware, or other third-party components. For further information about third-party support, see link:https://access.redhat.com/third-party-software-support[Red Hat third-party support policy].

See the hardware documentation for the nodes or contact the hardware vendor for information about updating the firmware.

For HP servers, Redfish virtual media is not supported on 9th generation systems running iLO4, because Ironic does not support iLO4 with virtual media.

For Dell servers, ensure the {product-title} cluster nodes have AutoAttach Enabled through the iDRAC console. The menu path is: *Configuration* -> *Virtual Media* -> *Attach Mode* -> *AutoAttach* . With iDRAC 9 firmware version `04.40.00.00`, the Virtual Console plugin defaults to `eHTML5`, which causes problems with the *InsertVirtualMedia* workflow. Set the plug-in to `HTML5` to avoid this issue. The menu path is: *Configuration* -> *Virtual console* -> *Plug-in Type* -> *HTML5* .

[IMPORTANT]
====
The installer will not initiate installation on a node if the node firmware is below the foregoing versions when installing with virtual media.
