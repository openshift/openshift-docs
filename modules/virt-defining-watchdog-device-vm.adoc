= Configuring a watchdog device for the virtual machine

[role="_abstract"]
You configure a watchdog device for the virtual machine (VM).

.Prerequisites

* For `x86` systems, the VM must use a kernel that works with the `i6300esb` watchdog device. If you use `s390x` architecture, the kernel must be enabled for `diag288`. {op-system-base-full} images support `i6300esb` and `diag288`.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Create a `YAML` file with the following contents:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  labels:
    kubevirt.io/vm: <vm-label>
  name: <vm-name>
spec:
  runStrategy: Halted
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        kubevirt.io/vm: <vm-label>
    spec:
      domain:
        devices:
          watchdog:
            name: <watchdog>
            <watchdog-device-model>: <1>
              action: "poweroff" <2>
# ...
----
<1> The watchdog device model to use. For `x86` specify `i6300esb`. For `s390x` specify `diag288`.
<2> Specify `poweroff`, `reset`, or `shutdown`. The `shutdown` action requires that the guest virtual machine is responsive to ACPI signals. Therefore, using `shutdown` is not recommended.
+
The example above configures the watchdog device on a VM with the `poweroff` action and exposes the device as `/dev/watchdog`.
+
This device can now be used by the watchdog binary.

. Apply the YAML file to your cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,yaml]
----
$ oc apply -f <file_name>.yaml
----

.Verification

--
[IMPORTANT]
====
This procedure is provided for testing watchdog functionality only and must not be run on production machines.
====
--

. Run the following command to verify that the VM is connected to the watchdog device:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ lspci | grep watchdog -i
----

. Run one of the following commands to confirm the watchdog is active:

* Trigger a kernel panic:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger
----

* Stop the watchdog service:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# pkill -9 watchdog
----
