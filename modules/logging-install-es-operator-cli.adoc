= Installing the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator using the CLI

You can use the {oc-first} to install the Elasticsearch Operator on your {product-title} cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have the necessary persistent storage for Elasticsearch. Note that each Elasticsearch node requires its own storage volume.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you use a local volume for persistent storage, do not use a raw block volume, which is described with `volumeMode: block` in the `LocalVolume` object. Elasticsearch cannot use raw block volumes.
====
+
Elasticsearch is a memory-intensive application. By default, {product-title} installs three Elasticsearch nodes with memory requests and limits of 16 GB. This initial set of three {product-title} nodes might not have enough memory to run Elasticsearch within your cluster. If you experience memory issues that are related to Elasticsearch, add more Elasticsearch nodes to your cluster rather than increasing the memory on existing nodes.

* Ensure that you have downloaded the {cluster-manager-url-pull} as shown in _Obtaining the installation program_ in the installation documentation for your platform.
+
If you have the pull secret, add the `redhat-operators` catalog to the OperatorHub custom resource (CR) as shown in *Configuring {product-title} to use Red Hat Operators*.

.Procedure

. Create a `Namespace` object for the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: openshift-operators-redhat <1>
  annotations:
    openshift.io/node-selector: ""
  labels:
    openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true" <2>
----
<1> You must specify the `openshift-operators-redhat` namespace. To prevent possible conflicts with metrics, you should configure the Prometheus Cluster Monitoring stack to scrape metrics from the `openshift-operators-redhat` namespace and not the `openshift-operators` namespace. The `openshift-operators` namespace might contain community Operators, which are untrusted and could publish a metric with the same name as
ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
 a ROSA
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
 an {product-title}
endif::[]
metric, which would cause conflicts.
<2> String. You must specify this label as shown to ensure that cluster monitoring scrapes the `openshift-operators-redhat` namespace.

. Apply the `Namespace` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
----

. Create an `OperatorGroup` object for the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: openshift-operators-redhat
  namespace: openshift-operators-redhat <1>
spec: {}
----
<1> You must specify the `openshift-operators-redhat` namespace.

.. Apply the `OperatorGroup` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
----

. Create a `Subscription` object to subscribe a namespace to the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator:
+
.Example Subscription
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: "elasticsearch-operator"
  namespace: "openshift-operators-redhat" <1>
spec:
  channel: "stable-5.5" <2>
  installPlanApproval: "Automatic" <3>
  source: "redhat-operators" <4>
  sourceNamespace: "openshift-marketplace"
  name: "elasticsearch-operator"
----
<1> You must specify the `openshift-operators-redhat` namespace.
<2> Specify `stable`, or `stable-5.<x>` as the channel. See the following note.
<3> `Automatic` allows the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to automatically update the Operator when a new version is available. `Manual` requires a user with appropriate credentials to approve the Operator update.
<4> Specify `redhat-operators`. If your {product-title} cluster is installed on a restricted network, also known as a disconnected cluster,
specify the name of the CatalogSource object created when you configured the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).
+
[NOTE]
====
Specifying `stable` installs the current version of the latest stable release. Using `stable` with `installPlanApproval: "Automatic"` automatically upgrades the Operator to the latest stable major and minor release.

Specifying `stable-5.<x>` installs the current minor version of a specific major release. Using `stable-5.<x>` with `installPlanApproval: "Automatic"` automatically upgrades the Operator to the latest stable minor release within the major release you specify with `x`.
====

.. Apply the `Subscription` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
----
+
The OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator is installed to the `openshift-operators-redhat` namespace and copied to each project in the cluster.
