= Creating a load balancer service

Use the following procedure to create a load balancer service.

.Prerequisites

* Make sure that the project and service you want to expose exist.

.Procedure

To create a load balancer service:

. Log in to  {product-title}.

. Load the project where the service you want to expose is located.
+
----
$ oc project project1
----

. Open a text file on the master node and paste the following text, editing the
file as needed:
+
.Sample load balancer configuration file
====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: egress-2 <1>
spec:
  ports:
  - name: db
    port: 3306 <2>
  loadBalancerIP:
  type: LoadBalancer <3>
  selector:
    name: mysql <4>
----

<1> Enter a descriptive name for the load balancer service.
<2> Enter the same port that the service you want to expose is listening on.
<3> Enter `loadbalancer` as the type.
<4> Enter the name of the service.
====

. Save and exit the file.

. Run the following command to create the service:
+
----
oc create -f <file-name>
----
+
For example:
+
----
oc create -f mysql-lb.yaml
----

. Execute the following command to view the new service:
+
----
$ oc get svc
NAME       TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP                             PORT(S)          AGE
egress-2   LoadBalancer   172.30.22.226   ad42f5d8b303045-487804948.example.com   3306:30357/TCP   15m
----
+
The service has an external IP address automatically assigned if there is a cloud
provider enabled.

. On the master, use a tool, such as cURL, to make sure you can reach the service
using the public IP address:
+
----
$ curl <public-ip>:<port>
----
++
For example:
+
----
$ curl 172.29.121.74:3306
----
+
The examples in this section use a MySQL service, which requires a client application.
If you get a string of characters with the `Got packets out of order` message,
you are connecting with the service:
+
If you have a MySQL client, log in with the standard CLI command:
+
----
$ mysql -h 172.30.131.89 -u admin -p
Enter password:
