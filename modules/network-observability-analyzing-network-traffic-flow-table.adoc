= Analyzing network traffic with the flow table

[role="_abstract"]
The Network Observability Operator flow table provides a granular, real-time view of network traffic within the cluster.

The flow table aggregates data collected by the eBPF agent and displays it within the {product-title} web console. These enhancements allow network administrators to isolate specific traffic patterns across both containerized and virtualized workloads.

[id="key-features-enhanced-flow-table_{context}"]
== Key features of the Network Observability Operator flow table
* SDN-integrated IP management: For clusters using OVN-Kubernetes, the table tracks and displays IP addresses assigned to OpenShift Virtual Machines. This allows you to manage IP address management (IPAM) directly within the SDN rather than relying on external DHCP solutions.
* Dynamic column configuration: Customize the table layout by selecting specific metadata columns, such as source and destination namespaces, ports, and protocols.
* Advanced querying: The table supports a query expression language that enables complex filtering, such as excluding specific IP ranges or isolating traffic between nested workloads.

By leveraging these table enhancements, you can more efficiently identify network bottlenecks and security anomalies across your cluster infrastructure.

[id="key-features-quickfilters_{context}"]
== Key features of quick filters
* Granular flow control: Enables or disables the collection of network flows at the namespace level to manage data volume and overhead.
* Custom subnet labeling: Defines labels for external IP ranges relevant to the namespace. For example, a tenant can label a specific external database range as Legacy-DB-Subnet for easier identification in the web console.
* Namespace-specific quick filters: Creates custom filters that appear in the Network Traffic page. These filters are visible only to users with access to that namespace and help simplify the analysis of service-to-service communication.



//Rel notes: In Network Observability Operator 1.11, the NetFlows table includes enhancements that improve data visibility and simplify the management of large datasets.
