= Recovering from lost master hosts

Follow these steps to recover from the loss of the majority of master hosts, leading to etcd quorum loss.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* SSH access to a remaining master host.
* A backup directory containing both the etcd snapshot and static Kubernetes API server resources taken from the same backup. The file names in the directory must be in the following formats: `snapshot_<datetimestamp>.db` and `static_kuberesources_<datetimestamp>.tar.gz`.

.Procedure

. Restore etcd quorum on the remaining master.

.. Copy the etcd backup directory to the remaining master host.
+
This procedure assumes that you copied the `backup` directory containing the etcd snapshot and static Kubernetes API server resources to the `/home/core/` directory of your master host.

.. Access the remaining master host.

.. Set the `INITIAL_CLUSTER` variable to the list of members in the format of `<name>=<url>`. This variable will be passed to the restore script, and in this procedure, it is assumed that there is only a single member at this time.
+
----
[core@ip-10-0-143-125 ~]$ export INITIAL_CLUSTER="etcd-member-ip-10-0-143-125.ec2.internal=https://etcd-0.clustername.devcluster.openshift.com:2380"
----

.. Run the `etcd-snapshot-restore.sh` script.
+
Pass in two parameters to the `etcd-snapshot-restore.sh` script: the path to the etcd backup directory and list of members, which is defined by the `INITIAL_CLUSTER` variable.

+
Once the `etcd-snapshot-restore.sh` script completes, your cluster should now have a single member
etcd cluster, and API services will begin restarting. This might take up to 15 minutes.
+
In a terminal that has access to the cluster, run the following command to verify that it is ready:
+
----
$ oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/master
NAME                                         STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
ip-10-0-143-125.us-east-2.compute.internal   Ready    master   46m   v1.17.1
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Be sure that all old etcd members being replaced are shut down. Otherwise, they might try to connect to the new cluster and will report errors like the following in the logs:
----
2019-05-20 15:33:17.648445 E | rafthttp: request cluster ID mismatch (got 9f5f9f05e4d43b7f want 807ae3bffc8d69ca)
----
====

. Create new master hosts.
+
If your cluster has its Machine API enabled and functional, then when the
OpenShift `machine-api` Operator is restored, it will create the new masters. If you do
not have the `machine-api` Operator enabled, you must create new masters
using the same methods that were used to originally create them.
+
You will also need to approve the certificates signing requests (CSRs) for these new master hosts. Two pending CSRs are generated for each machine that was added to the cluster.

.. In a terminal that has access to the cluster, run the following commands to approve the CSRs:

... Get the list of current CSRs.
+
----
$ oc get csr
----

... Review the details of a CSR to verify it is valid.
+
----
$ oc describe csr <csr_name> <1>
----
<1> `<csr_name>` is the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.

... Approve each valid CSR.
+
----
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name>
----
+
Be sure to approve both the pending client and server CSR for each master that was added to the cluster.

.. In a terminal that has access to the cluster, run the following command to verify that your masters are ready:
+
----
$ oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/master
NAME                                         STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION

ip-10-0-156-255.us-east-2.compute.internal   Ready    master   92s   v1.17.1
ip-10-0-162-178.us-east-2.compute.internal   Ready    master   70s   v1.17.1
----

. Correct the DNS entries.

.. From the AWS console, review the etcd-0, etcd-1, and etcd-2 Route 53 records in the private DNS zone, and if necessary, update the value to the appropriate new private IP address. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-editing.html[Editing Records] in the AWS documentation for instructions.
+
You can obtain the private IP address of an instance by running the following command in a terminal that has access to the cluster.
+
----
$ oc get node ip-10-0-143-125.us-east-2.compute.internal -o  jsonpath='{.status.addresses[?(@.type=="InternalIP")].address}{"\n"}'
10.0.143.125
----

. Update load balancer entries.
+
If you are using a cluster-managed load balancer, the entries will automatically be updated for you. If you are not, be sure to update your load balancer with the current addresses of your master hosts.
+
If your load balancing is managed by AWS, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/target-group-register-targets.html#register-ip-addresses[Register or Deregister Targets by IP Address] in the AWS documentation for instructions on updating load balancer entries.

. Grow etcd to full membership.

.. Set up a temporary etcd certificate signer service on your master where you have restored etcd.

... Access the original master, and log in to your cluster as a `cluster-admin` user using the following command.
+

It may take up to 20 minutes for the new member to start.

... Repeat these steps to add your other new master host until you have achieved full etcd membership.

.. After all members are restored, remove the signer Pod because it is no longer needed.

In a terminal that has access to the cluster, run the following command:
+
----
$ oc delete pod -n openshift-config etcd-signer
----

Note that it might take several minutes after completing this procedure for all services to be restored. For example, authentication by using `oc login` might not immediately work until the OAuth server Pods are restarted.
