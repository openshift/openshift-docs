= Automatically injecting sidecars
:pantheon-module-type: PROCEDURE

To enable this feature, you add the annotation `sidecar.jaegertracing.io/inject` set to either the string `true` or the Jaeger instance name as returned by `oc get jaegers`.
When you specify `true`, there should be only a single Jaeger instance for the same namespace as the deployment, otherwise, the Operator cannot determine which Jaeger instance to use.  A specific Jaeger instance name on a deployment has a higher precedence than `true` applied on its namespace.

The following snippet shows a simple application that will inject a sidecar, with the Jaeger Agent pointing to the single Jaeger instance available in the same namespace:

.sample automatic sidecar injection

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
  annotations:
    "sidecar.jaegertracing.io/inject": "true" # <1>
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp

        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: acme/myapp:myversion

When the sidecar is injected, the Jaeger Agent can then be accessed at its default location on `localhost`.
