= FRRouting (FRR) log levels

[role="_abstract"]
To control the verbosity of network logs for troubleshooting or monitoring, refer to the FRRouting (FRR) logging levels. 

The following values define the severity of recorded events, so that you can use them to filter output based on operational requirements:

.Log levels
[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Log level | Description

| `all`
a|
Supplies all logging information for all logging levels.
| `debug`
a|
Information that is diagnostically helpful to people. Set to `debug` to give detailed troubleshooting information.
| `info`
|
Provides information that always should be logged but under normal circumstances does not require user intervention. This is the default logging level.
| `warn`
|
Anything that can potentially cause inconsistent `MetalLB` behaviour. Usually `MetalLB` automatically recovers from this type of error.

| `error`
a|
Any error that is fatal to the functioning of `MetalLB`. These errors usually require administrator intervention to fix.

| `none`
|Turn off all logging.
