[id="update-vsphere-virtual-hardware-on-compute-nodes_{context}"]
= Updating the virtual hardware for compute nodes on vSphere

To reduce the risk of downtime, it is recommended that compute nodes be upgraded serially.

[NOTE]
====
Multiple compute nodes can be upgraded in parallel given workloads are tolerant of having multiple nodes in a `NotReady` state. It is the responsibility of the administrator to ensure that the required compute nodes are available.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator permissions to execute the required permissions in the vCenter instance hosting your {product-title} cluster.
* Your vSphere ESXi hosts are version 6.7U3 or later.

.Procedure

. List the compute nodes in your cluster.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/worker
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME              STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
compute-node-0    Ready    worker   30m   v1.23.0
compute-node-1    Ready    worker   30m   v1.23.0
compute-node-2    Ready    worker   30m   v1.23.0
----
+
Note the names of your compute nodes.

. Mark the compute node as unschedulable:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm cordon <compute_node>
----

. Evacuate the pods from the compute node. There are several ways to do this. For example, you can evacuate all or selected pods on a node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm drain <compute_node> [--pod-selector=<pod_selector>]
----
+
See the "Understanding how to evacuate pods on nodes" section for other options to evacuate pods from a node.

. Shut down the virtual machine (VM) associated with the compute node. Do this in the vSphere client by right-clicking the VM and selecting *Power* -> *Shut Down Guest OS*. Do not shut down the VM using *Power Off* because it might not shut down safely.

. Upgrade the VM in the vSphere client. Follow link:https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1010675[Upgrading a virtual machine to the latest hardware version] in the VMware documentation for more information.

. Power on the VM associated with the compute node. Do this in the vSphere client by right-clicking the VM and selecting *Power On*.

. Wait for the node to report as `Ready`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc wait --for=condition=Ready node/<compute_node>
----

. Mark the compute node as schedulable again:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm uncordon <compute_node>
----

. Repeat this procedure for each compute node in your cluster.
