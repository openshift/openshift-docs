= Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator release notes

The release notes for the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator for Red Hat Openshift describe new features and enhancements, deprecated features, and known issues.

The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator uses the Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaler (KEDA) and is built on top of the {product-title} horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA).

[NOTE]
====
The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator for Red Hat OpenShift is provided as an installable component, with a distinct release cycle from the core {product-title}. The link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#cma[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy] outlines release compatibility.

[id="autoscaling-custom-2-8-2-upgrade-operator"]
==== Operator upgrade support

You can now upgrade from a prior version of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator. See "Changing the update channel for an Operator" in the "Additional resources" for information on upgrading an Operator.

[id="autoscaling-custom-2-8-2-must-gather"]
==== must-gather support

You can now collect data about the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator and its components by using the {product-title} `must-gather` tool. Currently, the process for using the `must-gather` tool with the Custom Metrics Autoscaler is different than for other operators. See "Gathering debugging data in the "Additional resources" for more information.
