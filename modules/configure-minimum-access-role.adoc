= Configuring minimum access role

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure a minimum access role that applies to all new users when they log in to the RHACS portal.
To set a minimum access role, you must first configure an authentication provider.
//TODO: Add link to configure an authentication provider

[NOTE]
====
* The minimum access role is granted to all users who sign in with the authentication provider you configure.
* Set the minimum access role to *None* if you want to define permissions entirely by using specific rules.
====

.Prerequisites
* You must have the *Admin* role, or read and write permissions for the `AuthProvider` and `Role` resources to create, modify, and delete custom roles.

.Procedure

. Under *Auth Providers*, select the authentication provider for which you want to configure the minimum access role.
. Click *Edit Provider*.
. Under section 2 *Assign StackRox roles to your <auth_provider> users*, select one of the roles from *Minimum access role*.
