= Configuring minimum access role

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure a minimum access role that applies to all new users when they log in to the {product-title-short} portal.
To set a minimum access role, you must first configure an authentication provider.
//TODO: Add link to configure an authentication provider

[NOTE]
====
* The minimum access role is granted to all users who sign in with the authentication provider you configure.
* Set the minimum access role to *None* if you want to define permissions entirely by using specific rules.

. Click *Edit Provider*.
