[id="migration-writing-ansible-playbook-hook_{context}"]
= Writing an Ansible playbook for a migration hook

You can write an Ansible playbook to use as a migration hook. The hook is added to a migration plan by using the {mtc-short} web console or by specifying values for the `spec.hooks` parameters in the `MigPlan` custom resource (CR) manifest.

The Ansible playbook is mounted onto a hook container as a config map. The hook container runs as a job, using the cluster, service account, and namespace specified in the `MigPlan` CR. The hook container uses a specified service account token so that the tasks do not require authentication before they run in the cluster.

== Ansible modules

You can use the Ansible `shell` module to run `oc` commands.

.Example `shell` module
[source,yaml]
----
- hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: get pod name
    shell: oc get po --all-namespaces
----

You can use `kubernetes.core` modules, such as `k8s_info`, to interact with Kubernetes resources.

.Example `k8s_facts` module
[source,yaml]
----
- hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: Get pod
    k8s_info:
      kind: pods
      api: v1
      namespace: openshift-migration
      name: "{{ lookup( 'env', 'HOSTNAME') }}"
    register: pods

  - name: Print pod name
    debug:
      msg: "{{ pods.resources[0].metadata.name }}"
----

You can use the `fail` module to produce a non-zero exit status in cases where a non-zero exit status would not normally be produced, ensuring that the success or failure of a hook is detected. Hooks run as jobs and the success or failure status of a hook is based on the exit status of the job container.

.Example `fail` module
[source,yaml]
----
- hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: Set a boolean
    set_fact:
      do_fail: true

  - name: "fail"
    fail:
      msg: "Cause a failure"
    when: do_fail

[id="migration-writing-ansible-playbook-hook-environment-variables_{context}"]
== Environment variables

The `MigPlan` CR name and migration namespaces are passed as environment variables to the hook container. These variables are accessed by using the `lookup` plug-in.

.Example environment variables
[source,yaml]
----
- hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - set_fact:
      namespaces: "{{ (lookup( 'env', 'migration_namespaces')).split(',') }}"

  - debug:
      msg: "{{ item }}"
    with_items: "{{ namespaces }}"

  - debug:
      msg: "{{ lookup( 'env', 'migplan_name') }}"
