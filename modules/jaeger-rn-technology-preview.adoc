====
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production.
These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process. For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.

When you install the Jaeger Operator you can select a Technology Preview version of Jaeger.  This gives you access to clients and infrastructure for exporting tracing data to Jaeger based on the link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry framework].  Note that this version is not supported for production environments.

The OpenTelemetry collector allows developers to instrument their code with vendor agnostic APIs, avoiding vendor lock-in and opening the door to a growing ecosystem of observability tooling.
