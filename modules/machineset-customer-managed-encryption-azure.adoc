= Enabling customer-managed encryption keys for a machine set

You can supply an encryption key to Azure to encrypt data on managed disks at rest. You can enable server-side encryption with customer-managed keys by using the Machine API.

An Azure Key Vault, a disk encryption set, and an encryption key are required to use a customer-managed key. The disk encryption set must be in a resource group where the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) has granted permissions. If not, an additional reader role is required to be granted on the disk encryption set.

.Procedure

* Configure the disk encryption set under the `providerSpec` field in your machine set YAML file. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
providerSpec:
  value:
    osDisk:
      diskSizeGB: 128
      managedDisk:
        diskEncryptionSet:
          id: /subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<resource_group_name>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/diskEncryptionSets/<disk_encryption_set_name>
        storageAccountType: Premium_LRS
