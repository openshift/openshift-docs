= About live migration permissions

[role="_abstract"]
In {VirtProductName} 4.19 and later, live migration operations are restricted to users who are explicitly granted the `kubevirt.io:migrate` cluster role. Users with this role can create, delete, and update virtual machine (VM) live migration requests.

The live migration requests are represented by `VirtualMachineInstanceMigration` (VMIM) custom resources. Cluster administrators can bind the `kubevirt.io:migrate` role to trusted users or groups at either the namespace or cluster level.

Before {VirtProductName} 4.19, namespace administrators had live migration permissions by default. This behavior changed in version 4.19 to prevent unintended or malicious disruptions to infrastructure-critical migration operations. 

As a cluster administrator, you can preserve the old behavior by creating a temporary cluster role before updating. After assigning the new role to users, delete the temporary role to enforce the more restrictive permissions. If you have already updated, you can still revert to the old behavior by aggregating the `kubevirt.io:migrate` role into the `admin` cluster role.
