= Embedding a CSI inline ephemeral volume in the `Pod` specification

You can embed a CSI inline ephemeral volume in the `Pod` specification in {product-title}. At runtime, nested inline volumes follow the ephemeral lifecycle of their associated pods so that the CSI driver handles all phases of volume operations as pods are created and destroyed.

.Procedure

. Create the `Pod` object definition and save it to a file.

. Embed the CSI inline ephemeral volume in the file.
