= Example address pool configurations

The following examples show address pool configurations for specific scenarios.

== Example: IPv4 and CIDR ranges

You can specify a range of IP addresses in classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) notation. You can combine CIDR notation with the notation that uses a hyphen to separate lower and upper bounds.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: doc-example-cidr
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
  - 192.168.100.0/24
  - 192.168.200.0/24
  - 192.168.255.1-192.168.255.5
# ...
----

== Example: Assign IP addresses

You can set the `autoAssign` field to `false` to prevent MetalLB from automatically assigning IP addresses from the address pool. You can then assign a single IP address or multiple IP addresses from an IP address pool. To assign an IP address, append the `/32` CIDR notation to the target IP address in the `spec.addresses` parameter. This setting ensures that only the specific IP address is avilable for assignment, leaving non-reserved IP addresses for application use.

.Example `IPAddressPool` CR that assigns multiple IP addresses

  name: doc-example-reserved
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
  - 192.168.100.1/32
  - 192.168.200.1/32
  autoAssign: false
# ...

[NOTE]
====
When you add a service, you can request a specific IP address from the address pool or you can specify the pool name in an annotation to request any IP address from the pool.
====

== Example: IPv4 and IPv6 addresses

You can add address pools that use IPv4 and IPv6. You can specify multiple ranges in the `addresses` list, just like several IPv4 examples.

Whether the service is assigned a single IPv4 address, a single IPv6 address, or both is determined by how you add the service. The `spec.ipFamilies` and `spec.ipFamilyPolicy` fields control how IP addresses are assigned to the service.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: doc-example-combined
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
  - 10.0.100.0/28 <1>
  - 2002:2:2::1-2002:2:2::100
# ...
----
<1> Where `10.0.100.0/28` is the local network IP address followed by the `/28` network prefix.

== Example: Assign IP address pools to services or namespaces

You can assign IP addresses from an `IPAddressPool` to services and namespaces that you specify.

If you assign a service or namespace to more than one IP address pool, MetalLB uses an available IP address from the higher-priority IP address pool. If no IP addresses are available from the assigned IP address pools with a high priority, MetalLB uses available IP addresses from an IP address pool with lower priority or no priority. 

[NOTE]
====
You can use the `matchLabels` label selector, the `matchExpressions` label selector, or both, for the `namespaceSelectors` and `serviceSelectors` specifications. This example demonstrates one label selector for each specification.
