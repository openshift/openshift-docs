= Deleting {sandboxed-containers-first} resources

You can remove and uninstall the `kata` runtime and all its related resources, such as CRI-O config and `RuntimeClass`, from your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You have {product-title} {product-version} installed on your cluster.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Delete the `KataConfig` custom resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete kataconfig <KataConfig_CR_Name>
----

. Delete the `KataConfig` custom resource definition by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete crd kataconfigs.kataconfiguration.openshift.io
----

The {sandboxed-containers-operator} removes all resources that were initially created to enable the runtime on your cluster. After you run the preceding commands, your cluster is restored to the state that it was prior to the installation process. You can now delete the `openshift-sandboxed-containers-operator` namespace.

.Verification

* To verify that the `KataConfig` custom resource is deleted, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get kataconfig <KataConfig_CR_Name>
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
No KataConfig instances exist
----

* To verify that the `KataConfig` custom resource definition is deleted, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get crd kataconfigs.kataconfiguration.openshift.io
