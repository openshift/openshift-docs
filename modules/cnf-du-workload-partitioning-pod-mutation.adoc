= Workload partitioning and pod mutation

The workload partitioning feature modifies pods that are annotated with `target.workload.openshift.io/<workload-type>`
that are in a namespace that contains the `workload.openshift.io/allowed: <workload-type>` annotation.

For example, a pod with the following CPU request specified would be mutated:

[source,yaml]
----
requests:
  cpu:
    400m
----

The requested CPU resource is replaced with a management cores resource:

[source,yaml]
----
requests:
  management.workload.openshift.io/cores: 400
----

The value of `resources.workload.openshift.io/{container-name}` is calculated as:

----
shares == (request_in_millis * 1024) /1000
----

This results in a value of 409 in this example.

An annotation is added with the same value:

[source,yaml]
----
annotations:
  resources.workload.openshift.io/{container-name}: {"cpushares": 409}
----

The new request value and annotation value are scaled up by 1000 from the original CPU request input because
opaque resources do not support units or fractional values. Note in the previous annotation example the request is in
milli-cores (409m) and the modified value is unitless.

Pods are not changed in a way that changes their Quality of Service (QoS) class. For example, the feature does not remove CPU requests unless the pod also has memory requests, because if we mutate the pod so that it has no CPU or memory requests the Quality of Service class of the pod would be changed automatically. In this case, the `workload.openshift.io/warning` annotation includes a message explaining that the partitioning instructions were ignored. Any pod that is already `BestEffort` is annotated using `2` as the value so that CRI-O has an indicator to configure the CPU shares as `BestEffort`.

Pods with QoS of `Guaranteed` are not mutated.

[NOTE]
====
The API server will remove any `resources.workload.openshift.io/` or `target.workload.openshift.io/` annotations from pods when they are scheduled. These annotations might only be set by the workload partitioning logic.
====

[NOTE]
====
Only pods with correct annotations on both the pod and namespace when the pod is created will take advantage of this feature. Workload partitioning annotations added after the pod is created will not have any impact. This has particular impact on post-installation Operators where the administrator must annotate the namespace prior to Operator installation.
