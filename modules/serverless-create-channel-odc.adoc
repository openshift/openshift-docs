= Creating a channel

Using the {ocp-product-title} web console provides a streamlined and intuitive user interface to create a channel. After Knative Eventing is installed on your cluster, you can create a channel by using the web console.

.Prerequisites

* You have logged in to the {ocp-product-title} web console.
* The {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Eventing are installed on your {ocp-product-title} cluster.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {ocp-product-title}.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *+Add* -> *Channel*.
. Select the type of `Channel` object that you want to create in the *Type* list.
+
[NOTE]
====
Currently only `InMemoryChannel` channel objects are supported by default. Knative channels for Apache Kafka are available if you have installed the Knative broker implementation for Apache Kafka on {ServerlessProductName}.
====

. Click *Create*.

.Verification

* Confirm that the channel now exists by navigating to the *Topology* page.
