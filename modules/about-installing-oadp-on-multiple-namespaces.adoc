= Installation of OADP on multiple namespaces

You can install OADP into multiple namespaces on the same cluster so that multiple project owners can manage their own OADP instance. This use case has been validated with Restic and CSI.

You install each instance of OADP as specified by the per-platform procedures contained in this document with the following additional requirements:

* All deployments of OADP on the same cluster must be the same version, for example, 1.1.4. Installing different versions of OADP on the same cluster is *not* supported.
* Each individual deployment of OADP must have a unique set of credentials and a unique `BackupStorageLocation` configuration.
* By default, each OADP deployment has cluster-level access across namespaces. {product-title} administrators need to review security and RBAC settings carefully and make any necessary changes to them to ensure that each OADP instance has the correct permissions.
