= Installation of {oadp-short} on multiple namespaces

You can install {oadp-full} into multiple namespaces on the same cluster so that multiple project owners can manage their own {oadp-short} instance. This use case has been validated with File System Backup (FSB) and Container Storage Interface (CSI).

You install each instance of {oadp-short} as specified by the per-platform procedures contained in this document with the following additional requirements:

* All deployments of {oadp-short} on the same cluster must be the same version, for example, 1.4.0. Installing different versions of {oadp-short} on the same cluster is *not* supported.

* Each individual deployment of {oadp-short} must have a unique set of credentials and at least one `BackupStorageLocation` configuration. You can also use multiple `BackupStorageLocation` configurations within the same namespace.

* By default, each {oadp-short} deployment has cluster-level access across namespaces. {OCP} administrators need to carefully review potential impacts, such as not backing up and restoring to and from the same namespace concurrently.
