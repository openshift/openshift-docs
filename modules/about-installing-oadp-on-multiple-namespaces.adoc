= Installation of {oadp-short} on multiple namespaces

You can install OADP on multiple namespaces on the same cluster to enable different project owners to manage their own backup instances. All instances must be the same version and have a unique set of credentials and at least one BackupStorageLocation configuration.

This use case has been validated with File System Backup (FSB) and Container Storage Interface (CSI).

You install each instance of {oadp-short} as specified by the per-platform procedures contained in this document with the following additional requirements:

* All deployments of {oadp-short} on the same cluster must be the same version, for example, 1.4.0. Installing different versions of {oadp-short} on the same cluster is *not* supported.

* Each individual deployment of {oadp-short} must have a unique set of credentials and at least one `BackupStorageLocation` configuration. You can also use multiple `BackupStorageLocation` configurations within the same namespace.

* By default, each {oadp-short} deployment has cluster-level access across namespaces. {OCP} administrators need to carefully review potential impacts, such as not backing up and restoring to and from the same namespace concurrently.
