= Cloning a data volume

.Prerequisites

For smart-cloning to occur, the following conditions are required.

* Your storage provider must support snapshots.
* The source and target PVCs must be defined to the same namespace.
* The source and target PVCs must be defined to the same storage class.
* The `VolumeSnapshotClass` object must reference the storage class defined to both the source and target PVCs.

If any of these prerequisites are not met, host-assisted cloning automatically occurs when you create a data volume with a PVC source.

.Procedure

To initiate cloning of a data volume:

. Create a YAML file for a `DataVolume` object that specifies the name of the
new data volume, the name and namespace of the source PVC, and the size of the new data volume. This example clones a source PVC in block mode, so `volumeMode: Block` is used:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cdi.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: DataVolume
metadata:
  name: <cloner-datavolume> <1>
spec:
  source:
    pvc:
      namespace: "<source-namespace>" <2>
      name: "<my-favorite-vm-disk>" <3>
  pvc:
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteMany
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: <2Gi> <4>
    volumeMode: Block <5>
----
<1> The name of the new data volume.
<2> The namespace where the source PVC exists.
<3> The name of the source PVC.
<4> The size of the new data volume. You must allocate enough space, or the
cloning operation fails. The size must be the same as or larger than the source PVC.
<5> Specifies that the destination is a block PV.

. Start cloning the PVC by creating the data volume:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <cloner-datavolume>.yaml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Data volumes prevent a virtual machine from starting before the PVC is prepared,
so you can create a virtual machine that references the new data volume while the
PVC clones.
