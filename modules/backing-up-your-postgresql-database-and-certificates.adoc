= Backing up your PostgreSQL database and certificates

By backing up your {rh-rhacs-first} instance with an external PostgreSQL database, you can ensure the security and integrity of your data by following a vendor-recommended procedure. In this process, you back up the PostgreSQL database first, and then back up the {product-title-short} certificates.

.Procedure

. To back up the PostgreSQL database, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ pg_dump -U <username> -d <database_name> -f <output_file_path>
----
+
where:

`<username>`:: Specifies the name of the user who has the necessary permissions to perform the dump.
`<database_name>`:: Specifies the actual name of the database.
`<output_file_path>`:: Specifies the desired location and name for your backup file.

. To back up the {product-title-short} certificates, run the following command:
