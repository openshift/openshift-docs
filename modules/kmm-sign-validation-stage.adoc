= Sign validation stage

Sign validation is executed only when image validation has failed, there is a `sign` section in the `Module` that is relevant for the upgrade kernel, and build validation finished successfully in the event there was a `build` section in the `Module` relevant for the upgraded kernel. Sign validation will try to run the sign job and validate that it finishes successfully.

If the `PushBuiltImage` flag is defined in the `PreflightValidationOCP` CR, sign validation will also try to push the resulting image to its registry.

The resulting image is always the image defined in the `containerImage` field of the `Module`. The input image is either the output of the Build stage, or an image defined in the `UnsignedImage` field.

[NOTE]
====
If a `build` section exists, the `sign` section input image is the `build` section's output image. Therefore, in order for the input image to be available for the `sign` section, the `PushBuiltImage` flag must be defined in the `PreflightValidationOCP` CR.
