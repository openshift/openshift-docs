== Troubleshooting oc-mirror plugin v2 errors

oc-mirror plugin v2 now logs all image mirroring errors in a separate file, making it easier to track and diagnose failures.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When errors occur while mirroring release or release component images, they are critical. This stops the mirroring process immediately.

Errors with mirroring Operators, Operator-related images, or additional images do not stop the mirroring process. Mirroring continues, and oc-mirror plugin v2 logs updates every 8 images.
====

When an image fails to mirror, and that image is mirrored as part of one or more Operator bundles, oc-mirror plugin v2 notifies the user which Operators are incomplete, providing clarity on the Operator bundles affected by the error.

.Procedure

. Check for server-related issues:

.. Open the `mirroring_error_date_time.log` file in the  `working-dir/logs` folder located in the oc-mirror plugin v2 output directory.
.. Look for error messages that typically indicate server-side issues, such as `HTTP 500` errors, expired tokens, or timeouts.
.. Retry the mirroring process or contact support if the issue persists.

. Check for incomplete mirroring of Operators:

.. Check for warnings in the console or log file indicating which Operators are incomplete.
+
If an Operator is flagged as incomplete, the image related to that Operator likely failed to mirror.

.. Manually mirror the missing image or retry the mirroring process.

. Check for errors related to generated cluster resources. Even if some images fail to mirror, oc-mirror v2 will still generate cluster resources such as `IDMS.yaml` and `ITMS.yaml` files for the successfully mirrored images.
.. Check the output directory for the generated files.
.. If these files are missing for specific images, ensure that no critical errors occurred for those images during the mirroring process.

By following these steps, you can better diagnose issues and ensure smoother mirroring.
