== Troubleshooting the oc-mirror plugin v2 errors

oc-mirror plugin v2 now logs all image mirroring errors in a separate file, making it easier to track and diagnose failures.

Additionally, when an image fails to mirror, oc-mirror plugin v2 informs the user which operator is incomplete as a result. This provides greater clarity and helps identify which operator bundles are affected by the mirroring errors.

.Procedure

. Check the log files:
    
 Review the separate log file for detailed error messages related to image mirroring. This file will contain specific errors encountered during the process.

. Identify incomplete operators:

 If the mirroring process fails for some images, look for warnings in the console or logs that indicate which operator is incomplete due to the failure.

. Review the cluster resources:
    
 Even if some images fail to mirror, oc-mirror plugin v2 should generate cluster resources for the images that were successfully mirrored. Ensure the necessary resources (such as IDMS and ITMS files) are in place for the correctly mirrored images.

By following these steps and understanding how oc-mirror plugin v2 handles errors, users can better diagnose issues and ensure smoother mirroring operations.
