= Creating a break glass credential for a {hcp-title} cluster

As a {hcp-title} cluster owner, you can use the break glass credential to create temporary administrative client credentials to access your clusters that are configured with custom OpenID Connect (OIDC) token issuers. Creating a break glass credential generates a new cluster-admin `kubeconfig` file. The `kubeconfig` file contains information about the cluster that the CLI uses to connect a client to the correct cluster and API server. You can use the newly generated `kubeconfig` file to allow access to the {hcp-title} cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a {hcp-title} cluster with external authentication enabled. For more information, see _Creating a {hcp-title} with HCP cluster that uses external authentication providers_.
* You have created an external authentication provider. For more information, see _Creating an external authentication provider_.
* You have an account with `cluster admin` permissions.

.Procedure

. Create a break glass credential by using one of the following commands:

** To create a break glass credential by using the interactive command interface to interactively specify custom settings, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create break-glass-credential -c <cluster_name> -i <1>
----
<1> Replace <cluster_name> with the name of your cluster.
+
This command starts an interactive CLI process:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
I: Enabling interactive mode
? Username (optional): <1>
? Expiration duration (optional): <2>
I: Successfully created a break glass credential for cluster 'ac-hcp-test'.
----
<1> If left blank, the value in the `username` will have a randomly generated username value.
<2> The minimum validity of the break glass credential is 10 minutes, and the maximum validity is 24 hours. If left blank, the expiration duration value defaults to 24 hours.
+
** To create a break glass credential for cluster called `mycluster` with specified values:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create break-glass-credential -c mycluster --username test-username --expiration 1h
----
+
. List the break glass credential IDs, status, and associated users that are available for a cluster called `mycluster` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list break-glass-credential -c mycluster
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
ID                                USERNAME    STATUS
2a7jli9n4phe6c02ul7ti91djtv2o51d  test-user   issued
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You can also view the credentials in a JSON output by adding the `-o json` argument to the command.
====

. To view the status of a break glass credential, run the following command, replacing <break_glass_credential_id> with the break glass credential ID:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa describe break-glass-credential <break_glass_credential_id> -c <cluster_name>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
ID:                                    2a7jli9n4phe6c02ul7ti91djtv2o51d
Username:                              test-user
Expire at:                             Dec 28 2026 10:23:05 EDT
Status:                                issued
----
+
The following is a list of possible `Status` field values:
+
* `issued` The break glass credential has been issued and is ready to use.
* `expired` The break glass credential has expired and can no longer be used.
* `failed` The break glass credential has failed to create. In this case, you receive a service log detailing the failure. For more information about service logs, see _Accessing the service logs for Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Service on AWS clusters_. For steps to contact Red{nbsp}Hat Support for assistance, see _Getting support_.
* `awaiting_revocation` The break glass credential is currently being revoked, meaning it cannot be used.
* `revoked` The break glass credential has been revoked and can no longer be used.
+
. To retrieve the `kubeconfig`, run the following commands:
** Create a `kubeconfigs` directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir ~/kubeconfigs
----
+
** Export the newly generated `kubeconfig` file, replacing <cluster_name> with the name of your cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export CLUSTER_NAME=<cluster_name> && export KUBECONFIG=~/kubeconfigs/break-glass-${CLUSTER_NAME}.kubeconfig
----
+
** View the `kubeconfig`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa describe break-glass-credential <break_glass_credential_id> -c mycluster --kubeconfig
----
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    server: <server_url>
  name: cluster
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: cluster
    namespace: default
    user: test-username
  name: admin
current-context: admin
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: test-user
  user:
    client-certificate-data: <client-certificate-data> <1>
    client-key-data: <client-key-data> <2>
----
<1> The client-certificate contains a certificate for the user signed by the Kubernetes certificate authorities (CA).
<2> The client-key contains the key that signed the client certificate.
+
. Optional: To save the `kubeconfig`, run the following command :
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa describe break-glass-credential <break_glass_credential_id> -c mycluster --kubeconfig > $KUBECONFIG
----
