= Using image change triggers

Image change triggers allow your build to be automatically invoked when a new
version of an upstream image is available. For example, if a build is based on
top of a RHEL image, then you can trigger that build to run any time the RHEL
image changes. As a result, the application image is always running on the
latest RHEL base image.

[NOTE]
====
Imagestreams that point to container images in
link:http://docs.docker.com/v1.7/reference/api/hub_registry_spec/#docker-registry-1-0[v1
container registries] only trigger a build once when the imagestreamtag
becomes available and not on subsequent image updates. This is due to the lack
of uniquely identifiable images in v1 container registries.
====

.Procedure

Configuring an image change trigger requires the following actions:

. Define an `ImageStream` that points to the upstream image you want to
trigger on:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: "ImageStream"
apiVersion: "v1"
metadata:
  name: "ruby-20-centos7"
----
+
This defines the imagestream that is tied to a container image repository
located at *_<system-registry>_/_<namespace>_/ruby-20-centos7*. The
*_<system-registry>_* is defined as a service with the name `docker-registry`
running in {product-title}.

. If an imagestream is the base image for the build, set the from field in the
build strategy to point to the imagestream:
+
[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "ruby-20-centos7:latest"
----
+
In this case, the `sourceStrategy` definition is consuming the `latest` tag of
the imagestream named `ruby-20-centos7` located within this namespace.

. Define a build with one or more triggers that point to imagestreams:
+
[source,yaml]
----
type: "imageChange" <1>
imageChange: {}
type: "imageChange" <2>
imageChange:
  from:
    kind: "ImageStreamTag"
    name: "custom-image:latest"
----
<1> An image change trigger that monitors the `ImageStream` and `Tag` as
defined by the build strategy's `from` field. The `imageChange` object here
must be empty.
<2> An image change trigger that monitors an arbitrary imagestream. The
`imageChange` part in this case must include a `from` field that references
the `ImageStreamTag` to monitor.

When using an image change trigger for the strategy imagestream, the generated
build is supplied with an immutable Docker tag that points to the latest image
corresponding to that tag. This new image reference will be used by the strategy
when it executes for the build.

For other image change triggers that do not reference the strategy imagestream,
a new build will be started, but the build strategy will not be updated with a
unique image reference.

Since this example has an image change trigger for the strategy, the
resulting build will be:

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "DockerImage"
      name: "172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos7:<immutableid>"
----

This ensures that the triggered build uses the new image that was just pushed to
the repository, and the build can be re-run any time with the same inputs.

You can pause an image change trigger to allow multiple changes on the referenced
imagestream before a build is started. You can also set the `paused` attribute
to true when initially adding an `ImageChangeTrigger` to a `BuildConfig` to prevent
a build from being immediately triggered.

[source,yaml]
----
type: "ImageChange"
imageChange:
  from:
    kind: "ImageStreamTag"
    name: "custom-image:latest"
  paused: true
----

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
In addition to setting the image field for all `Strategy` types, for custom
builds, the `OPENSHIFT_CUSTOM_BUILD_BASE_IMAGE` environment variable is checked.
If it does not exist, then it is created with the immutable image reference. If
it does exist then it is updated with the immutable image reference.
endif::[]

If a build is triggered due to a webhook trigger or manual request,
the build that is created uses the `<immutableid>` resolved from the
`ImageStream` referenced by the `Strategy`. This ensures that builds
are performed using consistent image tags for ease of reproduction.
