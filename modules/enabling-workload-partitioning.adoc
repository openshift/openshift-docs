= Enabling workload partitioning 

With workload partitioning, cluster management pods are annotated to correctly partition them into a specified CPU affinity. These pods operate normally within the minimum size CPU configuration specified by the reserved value in the Performance Profile. Additional Day 2 Operators that make use of workload partitioning should be taken into account when calculating how many reserved CPU cores should be set aside for the platform.

Workload partitioning isolates user workloads from platform workloads using standard Kubernetes scheduling capabilities.

[NOTE]
====
Workload partitioning can only be enabled during cluster installation. You cannot disable workload partitioning postinstallation.
====

Use this procedure to enable workload partitioning cluster wide:  

.Procedure

* In the `install-config.yaml` file, add the additional field `cpuPartitioningMode` and set it to `AllNodes`.
