= About the HostFirmwareSettings resource

You can use the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource to retrieve and manage the BIOS settings for a host. When a host moves to the `Available` state, Ironic reads the host's BIOS settings and creates the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource. The resource contains the complete BIOS configuration returned from the baseboard management controller (BMC). Whereas, the `firmware` field in the `BareMetalHost` resource returns three vendor-independent fields, the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource typically comprises many BIOS settings of vendor-specific fields per host.

The `HostFirmwareSettings` resource contains two sections:

. The `HostFirmwareSettings` spec.
. The `HostFirmwareSettings` status.

== The `HostFirmwareSettings` spec

The `spec` section of the `HostFirmwareSettings` resource defines the desired state of the host's BIOS, and it is empty by default. Ironic uses the settings in the `spec.settings` section to update the baseboard management controller (BMC) when the host is in the `Preparing` state. Use the `FirmwareSchema` resource to ensure that you do not send invalid name/value pairs to hosts. See "About the FirmwareSchema resource" for additional details.

.Example
[source,terminal]
----
spec:
  settings:
    ProcTurboMode: Disabled<1>
----
<1> In the foregoing example, the `spec.settings` section contains a name/value pair that will set the `ProcTurboMode` BIOS setting to `Disabled`.

[NOTE]
====
Integer parameters listed in the `status` section appear as strings. For example, `"1"`. When setting integers in the `spec.settings` section, the values should be set as integers without quotes. For example, `1`.
====

== The `HostFirmwareSettings` status

The `status` represents the current state of the host's BIOS.

a| The `conditions` field contains a list of state changes. The sub-fields include:

* `lastTransitionTime`: The last time the state changed.
* `message`: A description of the state change.
* `observedGeneration`: The current generation of the `status`. If `metadata.generation` and this field are not the same, the `status.conditions` might be out of date.
* `reason`: The reason for the state change.
* `status`: The status of the state change. The status can be `True`, `False` or `Unknown`.
* `type`: The type of state change. The types are `Valid` and `ChangeDetected`.

----
a| The `FirmwareSchema` for the firmware settings. The fields include:

* `name`: The name or unique identifier referencing the schema.
* `namespace`: The namespace where the schema is stored.
* `lastUpdated`: The last time the resource was updated.
