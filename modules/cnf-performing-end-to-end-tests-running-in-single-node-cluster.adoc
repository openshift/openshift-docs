= Running latency tests on a {sno} cluster

You can run latency tests on {sno} clusters.

[NOTE]
====
When executing `podman` commands as a non-root or non-privileged user, mounting paths can fail with `permission denied` errors. To make the `podman` command work, append `:Z` to the volumes creation; for example, `-v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z`. This allows `podman` to do the proper SELinux relabeling.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have applied a cluster performance profile by using the Node Tuning Operator.

.Procedure

* To run the latency tests on a {sno} cluster, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
-e LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME=<time_in_seconds> registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel8:v{product-version} \
/usr/bin/test-run.sh --ginkgo.v
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The default runtime for each test is 300 seconds. 
For valid latency test results, run the tests for at least 12 hours by updating the `LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME` variable.
To run the buckets latency validation step, you must specify a maximum latency. For details on maximum latency variables, see the table in the "Measuring latency" section.
====
+
After running the test suite, all the dangling resources are cleaned up.
