= Running latency tests on a {sno} cluster

You can run latency tests on {sno} clusters.

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Always** run the latency tests with `DISCOVERY_MODE=true` set. If you don't, the test suite will make changes to the running cluster configuration.
====

[NOTE]
====
When executing `podman` commands as a non-root or non-privileged user, mounting paths can fail with `permission denied` errors. To make the `podman` command work, append `:Z` to the volumes creation; for example, `-v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z`. This allows `podman` to do the proper SELinux relabeling.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

* To run the latency tests on a {sno} cluster, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
-e DISCOVERY_MODE=true -e FEATURES=performance -e ROLE_WORKER_CNF=master \
registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel8:v{product-version} \
/usr/bin/test-run.sh -ginkgo.focus="\[performance\]\ Latency\ Test"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
`ROLE_WORKER_CNF=master` is required because master is the only machine pool to which the node belongs. For more information about setting the required `MachineConfigPool` for the latency tests, see "Prerequisites for running latency tests".
====
+
After running the test suite, all the dangling resources are cleaned up.
