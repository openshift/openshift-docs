= Installing Knative Eventing using YAML

.Procedure

. Create a file named `eventing.yaml`.
. Copy the following sample YAML into `eventing.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KnativeEventing
metadata:
    name: knative-eventing
    namespace: knative-eventing
----
. Optional. Make any changes to the YAML that you want to implement for your Knative Eventing deployment.
. Apply the `eventing.yaml` file by entering:
+
----
$ oc apply -f eventing.yaml
----

.Verification

. To verify the installation is complete, enter:
+
----
$ oc get knativeeventing.operator.knative.dev/knative-eventing \
  -n knative-eventing \
  --template='{{range .status.conditions}}{{printf "%s=%s\n" .type .status}}{{end}}'
----
+
The output should be similar to:
+
----
InstallSucceeded=True
Ready=True
----
+
[NOTE]
====
It may take a few seconds for the Knative Eventing resources to be created.
====
. If the conditions have a status of `Unknown` or `False`, wait a few moments and then check again after you have confirmed that the resources have been created.
. Check that the Knative Eventing resources have been created by entering:
+
----
$ oc get pods -n knative-eventing
----
+
The output should look similar to:
+
