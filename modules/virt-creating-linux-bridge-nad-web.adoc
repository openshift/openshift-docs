= Creating a Linux bridge NAD by using the web console

[role="_abstract"]
You can create a network attachment definition (NAD) to provide layer-2 networking to pods and virtual machines by using the {product-title} web console.

[WARNING]
====
Configuring IP address management (IPAM) in a network attachment definition for virtual machines is not supported.
====

.Procedure

. In the web console, click *Networking* -> *NetworkAttachmentDefinitions*.
. Click *Create Network Attachment Definition*.
+
[NOTE]
====
The network attachment definition must be in the same namespace as the pod or virtual machine.
====
+
. Enter a unique *Name* and optional *Description*.
. Select *CNV Linux bridge* from the *Network Type* list.
. Enter the name of the bridge in the *Bridge Name* field.
. Optional: If the resource has VLAN IDs configured, enter the ID numbers in the *VLAN Tag Number* field.
+
[NOTE]
====
OSA interfaces on {ibm-z-name} do not support VLAN filtering and VLAN-tagged traffic is dropped. Avoid using VLAN-tagged NADs with OSA interfaces.
====
+
. Optional: Select *MAC Spoof Check* to enable MAC spoof filtering. This feature provides security against a MAC spoofing attack by allowing only a single MAC address to exit the pod.
. Click *Create*.
