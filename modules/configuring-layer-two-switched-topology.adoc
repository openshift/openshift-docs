= Configuration for a switched topology

The switched (layer 2) topology networks interconnect the workloads through a cluster-wide logical switch. This configuration can be used for IPv6 and dual-stack deployments.

[NOTE]
====
Layer 2 switched topology networks only allow for the transfer of data packets between pods within a cluster.
====

The following `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` custom resource definition (CRD) YAML describes the fields needed to configure a switched secondary network.
