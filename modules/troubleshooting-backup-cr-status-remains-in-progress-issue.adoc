= Troubleshooting issue where backup CR status remains in progress

If a backup is interrupted, it cannot be resumed, and the status of a `Backup` customer resource (CR) remains in the `InProgress` phase and does not complete.

.Procedure

. Retrieve the details of the `Backup` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n {namespace} exec deployment/velero -c velero -- ./velero \
  backup describe <backup>
----

. Delete the `Backup` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete backups.velero.io <backup> -n openshift-adp
----
+
You do not need to clean up the backup location because an in progress `Backup` CR has not uploaded files to object storage.

. Create a new `Backup` CR.

. View the Velero backup details by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal, subs="+quotes"]
----
$ velero backup describe <backup_name> --details
----
