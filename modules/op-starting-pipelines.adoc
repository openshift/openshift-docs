= Starting Pipelines

After you create a Pipeline, you need to start it  to execute the included Tasks in the defined sequence. You can start a Pipeline Run from the *Pipelines* view, *Pipeline Details* page, or the *Topology* view.

.Procedure
To start a Pipeline using the *Pipelines* view:

. In the *Pipelines* view of the *Developer* perspective, click the *Options* {Kebab} menu adjoining a Pipeline, and select *Start*.
. The *Start Pipeline* dialog box displays the *Git Resources* and the *Image Resources* based on the Pipeline definition.
+
[NOTE]
====
For Pipelines created using the *From Git* option, the *Start Pipeline* dialog box also displays an `APP_NAME` field in the *Parameters* section, and all the fields in the dialog box are prepopulated by the Pipeline templates.
====
+
.. If you have resources in your namespace, the *Git Resources* and the *Image Resources* fields are prepopulated with those resources. If required, use the drop-downs to select or create the required resources and customize the Pipeline Run instance.
. Optional: Modify the *Advanced Options* to add credentials to authenticate the specified private Git server or Docker registry.
+
.. Under *Advanced Options*, click *Show Credentials Options* and select *Add Secret*.
.. In the *Create Source Secret* section, specify the following:

... A unique *Secret Name* for the secret.
... In the *Designated provider to be authenticated* section, specify the provider to be authenticated in the *Access to* field, and the base *Server URL*.
... Select the *Authentication Type* and provide the credentials:
* For the *Authentication Type* `Image Registry Crendentials`, specify the *Registry Server Address* that you want to authenticate, and provide your credentials in the *Username*, *Password*, and *Email* fields.
+
Select *Add Credentials* if you want to specify an additional *Registry Server Address*.

* For the *Authentication Type* `Basic Authentication`, specify the values for the *UserName* and *Password or Token* fields.
* For the *Authentication Type* `SSH Keys`, specify the value for the *SSH Private Key* field.
... Select the check mark to add the secret.

+
You can add multiple secrets based upon the number of resources in your Pipeline.

. Click *Start* to start the PipelineRun.
. The *Pipeline Run Details* page displays the Pipeline being executed. After the Pipeline starts, the Tasks and Steps within each Task are executed.
You can:

* Hover over the Tasks to see the time taken for the execution of each Step.
* Click on a Task to see logs for each of the Steps in the Task.
* Click the *Logs* tab to see the logs according to the execution sequence of the Tasks and use the *Download* button to download the logs to a text file.

//Add workspace and credential steps in this section.
//Probably need a sep section for logging and monitoring pipelines.
. For Pipelines created using the *From Git* option, you can use the *Topology* view to interact with Pipelines after you start them:
+
[NOTE]
====
To see Pipelines created using the *Pipeline Builder* in the *Topology* view, customize the Pipeline labels to link the Pipeline with the application workload.
====
+
.. On the left navigation panel, click *Topology*, and click on the application to see the Pipeline Runs listed in the side panel.
.. In the *Pipeline Runs* section, click *Start Last Run* to start a new Pipeline Run with the same parameters and resources as the previous ones. This option is disabled if a Pipeline Run has not been initiated.
