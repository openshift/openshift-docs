[id="ztp-stopping-the-existing-gitops-ztp-applications_{context}"]
= Stopping the existing GitOps ZTP applications

Removing the existing applications ensures that any changes to existing content in the Git repository are not rolled out until the new version of the tooling is available.

Use the application files from the `deployment` directory. If you used custom names for the applications, update the names in these files first.
