.Procedure

. Download the latest version of the ROSA CLI (`rosa`) for your operating system from the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads[*Downloads*] page on {cluster-manager}.

. Extract the `rosa` binary file from the downloaded archive. The following example extracts the binary from a Linux tar archive:

----
$ sudo mv rosa /usr/local/bin/rosa
----

. Verify if the ROSA CLI is installed correctly by querying the `rosa` version:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa version
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
1.2.15
Your ROSA CLI is up to date.
