= Setting up the rosa CLI

[role="_abstract"]
To set up the `rosa` CLI, download the latest release, then configure and initialize `rosa`:

.Procedure

. Download the latest release of `rosa` for your operating system from the link:https://github.com/openshift/rosa/releases/latest[`rosa` releases page on GitHub].
+
. Optional: After downloading a release, you can rename the executable file that you downloaded to `rosa`, and then add `rosa` to your path.
+
. After downloading `rosa`, enable Bash completion for `rosa`. Bash completion helps to automatically complete commands and suggest options when you press `Tab`. The command generates a Bash completion file for `rosa` and sources it to your current shell session.
+
To configure your Bash shell to load `rosa` completions for each session, add the following command to your `Bashrc` file (`~/.Bashrc` or `~/.profile`).
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ . <(rosa completion)
----
+
. Enter the following command in the Bash terminal to verify that your user now has `cluster-admin` access. A cluster administrator can run this command without errors, but a dedicated administrator cannot.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get all -n openshift-apiserver
----

.Example output
