== Alerting rules

{product-title} Cluster Monitoring by default ships with alerting rules defined in the link:https://github.com/openshift/cluster-monitoring-operator/blob/master/assets/prometheus-k8s/rules.yaml[rules configuration file]. #FIXME what's the correct file?#

Note that:

* Currently you cannot add custom alerting rules.
* Some alerting rules have identical names. This is intentional. They are alerting about the same event with different thresholds, with different severity, or both.
* With the inhibition rules, the lower severity is inhibited when the higher severity is firing.
* #FIXME anything else to mention?#
