= Machine set scaling of machines with configured static IP addresses

You can use a machine set to scale machines with configured static IP addresses.

After you configure a machine set to request a static IP address for a machine, the machine controller creates an `IPAddressClaim` resource in the `openshift-machine-api` namespace. The external controller then creates an `IPAddress` resource and binds any static IP addresses to the `IPAddressClaim` resource.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Your organization might use numerous types of IP address management (IPAM) services. If you want to enable a particular IPAM service on {product-title}, you might need to manually create the `IPAddressClaim` resource in a YAML definition and then bind a static IP address to this resource by entering the following command in your `oc` CLI:

[source, terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <ipaddressclaim_filename>
----
====

The following demonstrates an example of an `IPAddressClaim` resource:

[source, yaml]
----
kind: IPAddressClaim
metadata:
  finalizers:
  - machine.openshift.io/ip-claim-protection
  name: cluster-dev-9n5wg-worker-0-m7529-claim-0-0
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
  poolRef:
    apiGroup: ipamcontroller.example.io
    kind: IPPool
    name: static-ci-pool
status: {}
----

The machine controller updates the machine with a status of `IPAddressClaimed` to indicate that a static IP address has succesfully bound to the `IPAddressClaim` resource. The machine controller applies the same status to a machine with multiple `IPAddressClaim` resources that each contain a bound static IP address.The machine controller then creates a virtual machine and applies static IP addresses to any nodes listed in the `providerSpec` of a machine's configuration.
