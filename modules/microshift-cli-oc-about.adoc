= About the OpenShift CLI

With the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI), the `oc` command, you can deploy and manage {microshift-short} projects from a terminal. The CLI `oc` tool is ideal in the following situations:

* Working directly with project source code
* Scripting {product-title} operations
* Managing projects while restricted by bandwidth resources
