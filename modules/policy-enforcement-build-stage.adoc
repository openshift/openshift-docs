= Build stage enforcement

[role="_abstract"]

{product-title-short} uses build stage policies to discover and respond to security violations before code is deployed. Build stage policies are composed entirely of image criteria, such as image registry, image content, and CVE data, including scan results and status. 

{product-title-short} checks the build by using the `roxctl image check` and `roxctl deployment check` commands. You can configure {product-title-short} to fail your continuous integration (CI) builds when images match the criteria of the policy. This means that when there is a condition in the build that violates the policy, for example, if there is a fixable CVE of a severity level and you have configured a policy for that condition, the build fails. 

As an example, you can configure {product-title-short} to check an image or deployment and integrate that check into a continuous integration/continuous development (CI/CD) pipeline. Then, if {product-title-short} detects a condition that means a policy should fail, the {product-title-short} API returns a non-zero exit code. These violations are not collected or acted on by {product-title-short}, but are used with a CI/CD tool. You configure your CI/CD tool to act on those results, for example, to fail the build process if a violation is reported.
