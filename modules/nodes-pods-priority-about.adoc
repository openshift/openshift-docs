= Understanding pod priority

When you use the Pod Priority and Preemption feature, the scheduler orders pending pods by their priority, and a pending pod is placed ahead of other pending pods with lower priority in the scheduling queue. As a result, the higher priority pod might be scheduled sooner than pods with lower priority if its scheduling requirements are met. If a pod cannot be scheduled, scheduler continues to schedule other lower priority pods.

== Pod priority classes

You can assign pods a priority class, which is a non-namespaced object that defines a mapping from a name to the integer value of the priority. The higher the value, the higher the priority.

A priority class object can take any 32-bit integer value smaller than or equal to 1000000000 (one billion). Reserve numbers larger than one billion for critical pods that should not be preempted or evicted. By default, {product-title} has two reserved priority classes for critical system pods to have guaranteed scheduling.

* *system-node-critical* - This priority class has a value of 2000001000 and is used for all pods that should never be evicted from a node. Examples of pods that have this priority class are `sdn-ovs`, `sdn`, and so forth. A number of critical components include the `system-node-critical` priority class by default, for example:
+
** master-api
** master-controller
** master-etcd
** sdn
** sdn-ovs
** sync

* *system-cluster-critical* - This priority class has a value of 2000000000 (two billion) and is used with pods that are important for the cluster. Pods with this priority class can be evicted from a node in certain circumstances. For example, pods configured with the `system-node-critical` priority class can take priority. However, this priority class does ensure guaranteed scheduling. Examples of pods that can have this priority class are fluentd, add-on components like descheduler, and so forth.
A number of critical components include the `system-cluster-critical` priority class by default, for example:
+
** fluentd
** metrics-server
** descheduler

* *cluster-logging* - This priority is used by Fluentd to make sure Fluentd pods are scheduled to nodes over other apps.

[NOTE]
====
If you upgrade your existing cluster, the priority of your existing pods is effectively zero. However, existing pods with
the `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/critical-pod` annotation are automatically converted to `system-cluster-critical` class.
Fluentd cluster logging pods with the annotation are converted to the `cluster-logging` priority class.

== Pod priority names

After you have one or more priority classes, you can create pods that specify a priority class name in a `Pod` spec. The priority admission controller uses the priority class name field to populate the integer value of the priority. If the named priority class is not found, the pod is rejected.
