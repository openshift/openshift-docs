[id="nfs-volume-security_{context}"]
= NFS volume security

This section covers NFS volume security, including matching permissions and
SELinux considerations. The user is expected to understand the basics of
POSIX permissions, process UIDs, supplemental groups, and SELinux.

Developers request NFS storage by referencing either a PVC by name or the
NFS volume plug-in directly in the `volumes` section of their Pod
definition.

The `/etc/exports` file on the NFS server contains the accessible NFS
directories. The target NFS directory has POSIX owner and group IDs. The
{product-title} NFS plug-in mounts the container's NFS directory with the
same POSIX ownership and permissions found on the exported NFS directory.
However, the container is not run with its effective UID equal to the
owner of the NFS mount, which is the desired behavior.

As an example, if the target NFS directory appears on the NFS server as:

[[nfs-export]]
[source,terminal]
----
$ ls -lZ /opt/nfs -d
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
drwxrws---. nfsnobody 5555 unconfined_u:object_r:usr_t:s0   /opt/nfs
----
[source,terminal]
----
$ id nfsnobody
----
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
uid=65534(nfsnobody) gid=65534(nfsnobody) groups=65534(nfsnobody)
----

Then the container must match SELinux labels, and either run with a UID of
`65534`, the `nfsnobody` owner, or with `5555` in its supplemental groups to access the directory.

[NOTE]
====
The owner ID of `65534` is used as an example. Even though NFS's
`root_squash` maps `root`, uid `0`, to `nfsnobody`, uid `65534`, NFS
exports can have arbitrary owner IDs. Owner `65534` is not required
for NFS exports.
