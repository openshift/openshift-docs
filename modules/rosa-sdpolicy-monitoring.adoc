This section provides information about the service definition for {product-title} monitoring.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-cluster-metrics_{context}"]
== Cluster metrics


{product-title} clusters come with an integrated Prometheus stack for cluster monitoring including CPU, memory, and network-based metrics. This is accessible through the web console. These metrics also allow for horizontal pod autoscaling based on CPU or memory metrics provided by an {product-title} user.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-cluster-status-notifications_{context}"]
== Cluster status notification

Red Hat communicates the health and status of {product-title} clusters through a combination of a cluster dashboard available in {cluster-manager}, and email notifications sent to the email address of the contact that originally deployed the cluster, and any additional contacts specified by the customer.
