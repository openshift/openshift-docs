= Monitoring


This section provides information about the service definition for {product-title} monitoring.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-cluster-metrics_{context}"]
== Cluster metrics


{product-title} clusters come with an integrated Prometheus stack for cluster monitoring including CPU, memory, and network-based metrics. This is accessible through the web console. These metrics also allow for horizontal pod autoscaling based on CPU or memory metrics provided by an {product-title} user.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-cluster-status-notifications_{context}"]
== Cluster status notification

Red Hat communicates the health and status of {product-title} clusters through a combination of a cluster dashboard available in the OpenShift Cluster Manager (OCM), and email notifications sent to the email address of the contact that originally deployed the cluster, and any additional contacts specified by the customer.
