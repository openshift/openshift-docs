= Ansible support in the Operator SDK

The link:https://operatorframework.io/[Operator Framework] is an open source toolkit to manage Kubernetes native applications, called _Operators_, in an effective, automated, and scalable way. This framework includes the Operator SDK, which assists developers in bootstrapping and building an Operator based on their expertise without requiring knowledge of Kubernetes API complexities.

One of the Operator SDK options for generating an Operator project includes leveraging existing Ansible playbooks and modules to deploy Kubernetes resources as a unified application, without having to write any Go code.
