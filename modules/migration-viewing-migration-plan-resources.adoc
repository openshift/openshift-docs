You can view migration plan resources to monitor a running migration or to troubleshoot a failed migration by using the {mtc-short} web console and the command line interface (CLI).

.Procedure

. In the {mtc-short} web console, click *Migration Plans*.
. Click the *Migrations* number next to a migration plan to view the *Migrations* page.
. Click a migration to view the *Migration details*.
. Expand *Migration resources* to view the migration resources and their status in a tree view.

[NOTE]
====
To troubleshoot a failed migration, start with a high-level resource that has failed and then work down the resource tree towards the lower-level resources.
====

. Click the Options menu {kebab} next to a resource and select one of the following options:

* *Copy `oc describe` command* copies the command to your clipboard.

** Log in to the relevant cluster and then run the command.

The conditions and events of the resource are displayed in YAML format.
