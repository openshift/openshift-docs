= About the cert-manager upstream authority plugin

The cert-manager plugin enables the SPIRE Server to dynamically request and receive intermediate signing certificates from cert-manager. The plugin automates the management of the SPIRE Server intermediate signing certificates by integrating with cert-manager.

When a SPIRE Server needs a new certificate, the cert-manager plugin creates a `CertificateRequest` custom resource in the configured {product-title} namespace. The namespace includes the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) generated by the SPIRE Server. The cert-manager plugin processes the `CertificateRequest` and an associated `Issuer` signs the Certificate Signing Request (CSR). The signed intermediate certificate and the full Certificate Authority (CA) bundle are available in the `CertificateRequest` status. These signed credentials are available to the SPIRE Server and used as its upstream signing authority.
