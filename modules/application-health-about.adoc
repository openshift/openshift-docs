= Understanding health checks

A probe is a Kubernetes action that periodically performs diagnostics on a
running container. Currently, two types of probes exist, each serving a
different purpose.

Readiness Probe::
A Readiness check determines if the container in which it is scheduled is ready to service requests. If
the readiness probe fails a container, the endpoints controller ensures the
container has its IP address removed from the endpoints of all services. A
readiness probe can be used to signal to the endpoints controller that even
though a container is running, it should not receive any traffic from a proxy.

For example, a Readiness check can control which Pods are used. When a Pod is not ready,
it is removed.

Liveness Probe::
A Liveness checks determines if the container in which it is scheduled is still
running. If the liveness probe fails due to a condition such as a deadlock, the kubelet kills the container The container then
responds based on its restart policy.

For example, a liveness probe on a node with a `restartPolicy` of `Always` or `OnFailure`
kills and restarts the Container on the node.

== Understanding the types of health checks

Liveness checks and Readiness checks can be configured in three ways:

HTTP Checks::
The kubelet uses a web hook to determine the healthiness of the container. The
check is deemed successful if the HTTP response code is between 200 and 399.

A HTTP check is ideal for applications that return HTTP status codes
when completely initialized.

Container Execution Checks::
The kubelet executes a command inside the container. Exiting the check with
status 0 is considered a success.

TCP Socket Checks::
The kubelet attempts to open a socket to the container. The container is only
considered healthy if the check can establish a connection. A TCP socket check is ideal for applications that do not start listening until
initialization is complete.
