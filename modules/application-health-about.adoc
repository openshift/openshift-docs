= Understanding health checks

A probe is a Kubernetes action that periodically performs diagnostics on a
running container. Currently, two types of probes exist, each serving a
different purpose.

Readiness Probe::
A Readiness check determines if the container in which it is scheduled is ready to service requests. If
the readiness probe fails a container, the endpoints controller ensures the
container has its IP address removed from the endpoints of all services. A
readiness probe can be used to signal to the endpoints controller that even
though a container is running, it should not receive any traffic from a proxy.

For example, a Readiness check can control which pods are used. When a pod is not ready,
it is removed.

Liveness Probe::
A Liveness checks determines if the container in which it is scheduled is still
running. If the liveness probe fails due to a condition such as a deadlock, the kubelet kills the container The container then
responds based on its restart policy.

For example, a liveness probe on a node with a `restartPolicy` of `Always` or `OnFailure`
kills and restarts the Container on the node.

----

Startup Probe::
Legacy applications can require additional startup time on their first initialization. This situation can make it difficult to set up liveness probe parameters without compromising the fast response to deadlocks that a liveness probe provides. To prevent containers from starting slowly, configure a startup probe using the same command, HTTP or TCP check, with a `failureThreshold * periodSeconds` value long enough to handle the worst case startup time.

For example, add the startup probe to the to the previous liveness check sample using a maximum of 5 minutes (30 * 10 = 300s). After the startup probe succeeds the first time, the liveness probe takes over to provide a fast response to container deadlocks. If the startup probe never succeeds within the specified time period, the container is killed and is subject to the pod's `restartPolicy`.

== Understanding the types of health checks

Liveness checks and Readiness checks can be configured in three ways:

HTTP Checks::
The kubelet uses a web hook to determine the healthiness of the container. The
check is deemed successful if the HTTP response code is between 200 and 399.

A HTTP check is ideal for applications that return HTTP status codes
when completely initialized.

Container Execution Checks::
The kubelet executes a command inside the container. Exiting the check with
status 0 is considered a success.

TCP Socket Checks::
The kubelet attempts to open a socket to the container. The container is only
considered healthy if the check can establish a connection. A TCP socket check is ideal for applications that do not start listening until
initialization is complete.
