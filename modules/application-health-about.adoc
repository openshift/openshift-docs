= Understanding health checks

A health check periodically performs diagnostics on a
running container using any combination of the readiness, liveness, and startup health checks.

You can include one or more probes in the specification for the pod that contains the container which you want to perform the health checks.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to add or edit health checks in an existing pod, you must edit the pod `DeploymentConfig` object or use the *Developer* perspective in the web console. You cannot use the CLI to add or edit health checks for an existing pod.

Readiness probe::
A _readiness probe_ determines if a container is ready to accept service requests. If
the readiness probe fails for a container, the kubelet removes the pod from the list of available service endpoints.
+
After a failure, the probe continues to examine the pod. If the pod becomes available, the kubelet adds the pod to the list of available service endpoints.

Liveness health check::
A _liveness probe_ determines if a container is still
running. If the liveness probe fails due to a condition such as a deadlock, the kubelet kills the container. The pod then
responds based on its restart policy.
+
For example, a liveness probe on a pod with a `restartPolicy` of `Always` or `OnFailure`
kills and restarts the container.

Startup probe::
A _startup probe_ indicates whether the application within a container is started. All other probes are disabled until the startup succeeds. If the startup probe does not succeed within a specified time period, the kubelet kills the container, and the container is subject to the pod `restartPolicy`.
+
Some applications can require additional startup time on their first initialization. You can use a startup probe with a liveness or readiness probe to delay that probe long enough to handle lengthy start-up time using the `failureThreshold` and `periodSeconds` parameters.
+
For example, you can add a startup probe, with a `failureThreshold` of 30 failures and a `periodSeconds` of 10 seconds (30 * 10s = 300s) for a maximum of 5 minutes, to a liveness probe. After the startup probe succeeds the first time, the liveness probe takes over.

You can configure liveness, readiness, and startup probes with any of the following types of tests:

* HTTP `GET`: When using an HTTP `GET` test, the test determines the healthiness of the container by using a web hook. The test is successful if the HTTP response code is between `200` and `399`.
+
You can use an HTTP `GET` test with applications that return HTTP status codes when completely initialized.

* Container Command: When using a container command test, the probe executes a command inside the container. The probe is successful if the test exits with a `0` status.

* TCP socket: When using a TCP socket test, the probe attempts to open a socket to the container. The container is only
considered healthy if the probe can establish a connection. You can use a TCP socket test with applications that do not start listening until
initialization is complete.

You can configure several fields to control the behavior of a probe:

* `initialDelaySeconds`: The time, in seconds, after the container starts before the probe can be scheduled. The default is 0.
* `periodSeconds`: The delay, in seconds, between performing probes. The default is `10`. This value must be greater than `timeoutSeconds`.
* `timeoutSeconds`: The number of seconds of inactivity after which the probe times out and the container is assumed to have failed. The default is `1`. This value must be lower than `periodSeconds`.
* `successThreshold`: The number of times that the probe must report success after a failure to reset the container status to successful. The value must be `1` for a liveness probe. The default is `1`.
* `failureThreshold`: The number of times that the probe is allowed to fail. The default is 3. After the specified attempts:
** for a liveness probe, the container is restarted
** for a readiness probe, the pod is marked `Unready`
** for a startup probe, the container is killed and is subject to the pod's `restartPolicy`
