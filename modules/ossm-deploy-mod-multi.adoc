= Multitenant service mesh

Typical service mesh deployments use a single control plane to configure communication between services in the mesh. Multitennant deployments specify the projects that can access the {ProductShortName} and isolate the {ProductShortName} from other control plane instances. 

== Multitennant resources

You can create your multitennant cluster by adding a `ServiceMeshMemberRole` resource to your control plane project, which is usually `istio-system`. The `ServiceMeshMemberRole` resource associates the projects in the list with one control plane. Your `ServiceMeshMemberRole` resource can contain can contain one or more projects that make up a service mesh.
