= Auto-instrumentation in the {OTELOperator}

Auto-instrumentation in the {OTELOperator} can automatically instrument an application without manual code changes. Developers and administrators can monitor applications with minimal effort and changes to the existing codebase.

Auto-instrumentation runs as follows:

. The {OTELOperator} injects an init-container, or a sidecar container for Go, to add the instrumentation libraries for the programming language of the instrumented application.

. The {OTELOperator} sets the required environment variables in the application's runtime environment. These variables configure the auto-instrumentation libraries to collect traces, metrics, and logs and send them to the appropriate OpenTelemetry Collector or another telemetry backend.

. The injected libraries automatically instrument your application by connecting to known frameworks and libraries, such as web servers or database clients, to collect telemetry data. The source code of the instrumented application is not modified.

. Once the application is running with the injected instrumentation, the application automatically generates telemetry data, which is sent to a designated OpenTelemetry Collector or an external OTLP endpoint for further processing.

Auto-instrumentation enables you to start collecting telemetry data quickly without having to manually integrate the OpenTelemetry SDK into your application code. However, some applications might require specific configurations or custom manual instrumentation.
