= {ibm-cloud-title} IAM Policies and API Key

To install {product-title} into your {ibm-cloud-name} account, the installation program requires an IAM API key, which provides authentication and authorization to access {ibm-cloud-name} service APIs. You can use an existing IAM API key that contains the required policies or create a new one.

For an {ibm-cloud-name} IAM overview, see the {ibm-cloud-name} link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-iamoverview[documentation].

1. The policy access scope should be set based on how granular you want to assign access. The scope can be set to *All resources* or *Resources based on selected attributes*.
2. Optional: This access policy is only required if you want the installation program to create a resource group. For more information about resource groups, see the {ibm-name} link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-rgs[documentation].

//TODO: IBM confirmed current values in the table above. They hope to provide more guidance on possibly scoping down the permissions (related to resource group actions).

* Access group (Recommended)
* Service ID
* User

The recommended method is to define IAM access policies in an link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-groups[access group]. This helps organize all the access required for {product-title} and enables you to onboard users and service IDs to this group. You can also assign access to link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-assign-access-resources[users and service IDs] directly, if desired.
