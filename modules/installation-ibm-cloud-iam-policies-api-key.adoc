= IBM Cloud VPC IAM Policies and API Key

To install {product-title} into your IBM Cloud account, the installation program requires an IAM API key, which provides authentication and authorization to access IBM Cloud service APIs. You can use an existing IAM API key that contains the required policies or create a new one.

For an IBM Cloud IAM overview, see the IBM Cloud link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-iamoverview[documentation].

[id="required-access-policies-ibm-cloud_{context}"]

1. The policy access scope should be set based on how granular you want to assign access. The scope can be set to *All resources* or *Resources based on selected attributes*.
2. Optional: This access policy is only required if you want the installation program to create a resource group. For more information on resource groups, see IBM Cloud's link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-rgs[documentation].

//TODO: IBM confirmed current values in the table above. They hope to provide more guidance on possibly scoping down the permissions (related to resource group actions).

[id="access-policy-assignment-ibm-cloud_{context}"]
== Access policy assignment

In IBM Cloud VPC IAM, access policies can be attached to different subjects:

* Access group (Recommended)
* Service ID
* User

The recommended method is to define IAM access policies in an link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-groups[access group]. This helps organize all the access required for {product-title} and enables you to onboard users and service IDs to this group. You can also assign access to link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-assign-access-resources[users and service IDs] directly, if desired.
