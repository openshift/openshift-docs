= Accessing a hosted cluster on {aws-short} by using the kubeadmin credentials

After creating a hosted cluster on {aws-first}, you can access a hosted cluster by getting the `kubeconfig` file, access secrets, and the `kubeadmin` credentials.

The hosted cluster namespace contains hosted cluster resources and the access secrets. The hosted control plane runs in the hosted control plane namespace.

The secret name formats are as follows:

* The `kubeconfig` secret: `<hosted_cluster_namespace>-<name>-admin-kubeconfig`. For example, `clusters-hypershift-demo-admin-kubeconfig`.

* The `kubeadmin` password secret: `<hosted_cluster_namespace>-<name>-kubeadmin-password`. For example, `clusters-hypershift-demo-kubeadmin-password`.

[NOTE]
====
The `kubeadmin` password secret is Base64-encoded and the `kubeconfig` secret contains a Base64-encoded `kubeconfig` configuration. You must decode the Base64-encoded `kubeconfig` configuration and save it into a `<hosted_cluster_name>.kubeconfig` file.
====

.Procedure

* Use your `<hosted_cluster_name>.kubeconfig` file that contains the decoded `kubeconfig` configuration to access the hosted cluster. Enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --kubeconfig <hosted_cluster_name>.kubeconfig get nodes
----
+
You must decode the `kubeadmin` password secret to log in to the API server or the console of the hosted cluster.
