= Mount the Azure File share in a pod

After the persistent volume claim has been created, it can be used inside by an application. The following example demonstrates mounting this share inside of a pod.

.Prerequisites

* A persistent volume claim exists that is mapped to the underlying Azure File share.

.Procedure

* Create a pod that mounts the existing persistent volume claim:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-name <1>
spec:
  containers:
    ...
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: "/data" <2>
      name: azure-file-share
  volumes:
    - name: azure-file-share
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: claim1 <3>
----
<1> The name of the pod.
<2> The path to mount the Azure File share inside the pod. Do not mount to the container root, `/`, or any path that is the same in the host and the container. This can corrupt your host system if the container is sufficiently privileged, such as the host `/dev/pts` files. It is safe to mount the host by using `/host`.
<3> The name of the `PersistentVolumeClaim` object that has been previously created.
