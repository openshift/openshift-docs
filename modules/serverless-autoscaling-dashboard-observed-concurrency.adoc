= Observed concurrency

The *Observed Concurrency* graph shows the timeline of a set of concurrency-related metrics, including:

* request concurrency
* panic concurrency
* target concurrency
* excess burst capacity

Note that `ExcessBurstCapacity` is a negative number, `-200` by default, that increases when a bursty load appears. It is equal to the difference between spare capacity and the configured target burst capacity. If `ExcessBurstCapacity` is negative, then the activator is threaded in the request path by the `PodAutoscaler` controller.
