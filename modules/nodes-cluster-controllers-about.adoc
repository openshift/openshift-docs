= Understanding admission controllers





ClusterResourceOverride::
This admission controller overrides user-provided resource requirements in order to drive scheduling density. Requires the `autoscaling.openshift.io` API.

RunOnceDuration::
This admission controller specifies a maximum duration a run-once pod can run to completion.  Requires the `autoscaling.openshift.io` API.

PodNodeConstraints::
This admission controller restricts the set of node selectors that can appear on a pod unless they have pods/binding perm.  Requires the `autoscaling.openshift.io` API.

OriginPodNodeEnvironment::
This admission controller 


DefaultTolerationSeconds::
This admission controller sets the default forgiveness toleration for pods to tolerate the `notready:NoExecute` and `unreachable:NoExecute` taints for 5 minutes, if the pods don’t already have toleration for taints. Requires the `operator.openshift.io/v1` API.

ExtendedResourceToleration::
This admission controller facilitates the creation of dedicated nodes with extended resources, such as GPUs, FPGAs, and so forth. If operators want to create dedicated nodes with extended resources, they are expected to taint the node with the extended resource name as the key. This admission controller, if enabled, automatically adds tolerations for such taints to pods requesting extended resources, so users don’t have to manually add these tolerations.  Requires the `operator.openshift.io/v1` API.

LimitPodHardAntiAffinityTopology::
This admission controller denies any pod that defines the `AntiAffinity` topology key other than `kubernetes.io/hostname` in `requiredDuringSchedulingRequiredDuringExecution`. Requires the `operator.openshift.io/v1` API.

PodNodeSelector::
This admission controller defaults and limits which node selectors can be used within a namespace by reading a namespace annotation and a global configuration. Requires the `operator.openshift.io/v1` API.

PodNodeSelector uses a configuration file to set options for the behavior of the backend. Note that the configuration file format will move to a versioned file in a future release. This file may be json or yaml and has the following format:

----
podNodeSelectorPluginConfig:
 clusterDefaultNodeSelector: name-of-node-selector
 namespace1: name-of-node-selector
 namespace2: name-of-node-selector
----

PodTolerationRestriction::
This admission controller first verifies any conflict between a pod’s tolerations and its namespace’s tolerations, and rejects the pod request if there is a conflict. It then merges the namespace’s tolerations into the pod’s tolerations. The resulting tolerations are checked against the namespace’s whitelist of tolerations. If the check succeeds, the pod request is admitted otherwise rejected. Requires the `operator.openshift.io/v1` API.

If the pod’s namespace does not have any associated default or whitelist of tolerations, then the cluster-level default or whitelist of tolerations are used instead if specified.

Tolerations to a namespace are assigned with the `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultTolerations` and `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/tolerationsWhitelist` annotation keys.

Priority::
The priority admission controller uses the `priorityClassName` field and populates the integer value of the priority. If the priority class is not found, the Pod is rejected. Requires the `operator.openshift.io/v1` API.
