= Creating {aws-short} infrastructure and IAM resources separate

By default, the `hcp create cluster aws` command creates cloud infrastructure with the hosted cluster and applies it. You can create the cloud infrastructure portion separately so that you can use the `hcp create cluster aws` command only to create the cluster, or render it to modify it before you apply it.

To create the cloud infrastructure portion separately, you need to create the {aws-first} infrastructure, create the {aws-short} Identity and Access (IAM) resources, and create the cluster.
