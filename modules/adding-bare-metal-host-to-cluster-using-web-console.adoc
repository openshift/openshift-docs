= Adding a bare metal host to the cluster using the web console

You can add bare metal hosts to the cluster in the web console.

.Prerequisites

* Install an {op-system} cluster on bare metal.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. In the web console, navigate to *Compute* -> *Bare Metal Hosts*.
. Select *Add Host* -> *New with Dialog*.
. Specify a unique name for the new bare metal host.
. Set the *Boot MAC address*.
. Set the *Baseboard Management Console (BMC) Address*.
. Optional: Enable power management for the host. This allows {product-title} to control the power state of the host.
. Enter the user credentials for the host's baseboard management controller (BMC).
. Select to power on the host after creation, and select *Create*.
. Scale up the number of replicas to match the number of available bare metal hosts. Navigate to *Compute* -> *MachineSets*, and increase the number of machine replicas in the cluster by selecting *Edit Machine count* from the *Actions* drop-down menu.

[NOTE]
====
You can also manage the number of bare metal nodes using the `oc scale` command and the appropriate bare metal machine set.
