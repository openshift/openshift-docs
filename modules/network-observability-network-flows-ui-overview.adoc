= Network flows visualization views

[role="_abstract"]
The Network Observability Operator integrates with the {product-title} web console to provide three primary traffic views: *Overview*, *Traffic Table*, and *Topology*.

* *Overview*: Displays high-level metrics such as bandwidth, packet rates, and Round Trip Time (RTT). It is used to identify general health trends and spikes.
* *Traffic Table*: Provides a granular, row-based view of every captured flow. It displays bidirectional traffic statistics, including protocol distribution for web and database traffic.
* *Topology*: Represents communication paths as a nodes-and-edges graph. Use this view to visualize dependencies between namespaces, nodes, and virtual machines.

To improve scannability, the interface uses custom Kubernetes icons to represent resource types, allowing you to distinguish between containers and virtualized workloads at a glance.
