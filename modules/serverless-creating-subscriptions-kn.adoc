= Creating subscriptions by using the Knative CLI

You can create a subscription to connect a channel to a sink by using the `kn` CLI.

.Prerequisites

To create subscriptions using the `kn` CLI, ensure that:

* The {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Eventing are installed on your {product-title} cluster.
* You have installed the `kn` CLI.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.

.Procedure

* Create a subscription to connect a sink to a channel:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn subscription create <subscription_name> \
  --channel <group:version:kind>:<channel_name> \ <1>
  --sink <sink_prefix>:<sink_name> \ <2>
  --sink-dead-letter <sink_prefix>:<sink_name> <3>
----
<1> `--channel` specifies the source for cloud events that should be processed. You must provide the channel name. If you are not using the default `InMemoryChannel` channel that is backed by the `Channel` custom resource, you must prefix the channel name with the `<group:version:kind>` for the specified channel type. For example, this will be `messaging.knative.dev:v1beta1:KafkaChannel` for a Kafka backed channel.
<2> `--sink` specifies the target destination to which the event should be delivered. By default, the `<sink_name>` is interpreted as a Knative service of this name, in the same namespace as the subscription. You can specify the type of the sink by using one of the following prefixes:
`ksvc`:: A Knative service.
`channel`:: A channel that should be used as destination. Only default channel types can be referenced here.
`broker`:: An Eventing broker.
<3> Optional: `--sink-dead-letter` is an optional flag that can be used to specify a sink which events should be sent to in cases where events fail to be delivered. For more information, see the {ServerlessProductName} _Event delivery_ documentation.

.Example command
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn subscription create mysubscription --channel mychannel --sink ksvc:event-display
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Subscription 'mysubscription' created in namespace 'default'.
----

.Verification

* To confirm that the channel is connected to the event sink, or _subscriber_, by a subscription, list the existing subscriptions and inspect the output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn subscription list
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME            CHANNEL             SUBSCRIBER           REPLY   DEAD LETTER SINK   READY   REASON
mysubscription   Channel:mychannel   ksvc:event-display                              True
