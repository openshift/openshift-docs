= Creating a Quarkus workflow project

[NOTE]
====
For most workflow creation and deployment scenarios, use the Operator with the `kn-workflow` plugin. Quarkus workflow projects are intended for development or advanced use cases.
====

You can use the `quarkus create` command with `kn workflow` to scaffold a new Quarkus workflow project in your current directory. You can also include additional Quarkus extensions during project creation.

For more information about Quarkus, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_build_of_quarkus/latest[Red Hat build of Quarkus documentation].

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {ServerlessLogicProductName} `kn-workflow` CLI plugin.

.Procedure

. Create a new Quarkus workflow project by running the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ kn workflow quarkus create
----
+
By default, the generated project is named `new-project`. You can overwrite the project name by running the command with the `--name` flag as follows:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ kn workflow quarkus create --name <your-project-name>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The generated project contains a minimal Quarkus workflow setup, including a sample `workflow.sw.json` file in `./<project-name>/src/main/resources/`.  
First-time execution might take several minutes due to dependency downloads.
====

. Optional: Add one or more extensions to the Quarkus project by running the command with the `--extension` flag as follows:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ kn workflow quarkus create --extension quarkus-jsonp,quarkus-smallrye-openapi
----
+
You can include multiple extensions as a comma-separated list. For example, the following command adds the `quarkus-jsonp` and `quarkus-smallrye-openapi` extensions:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ kn workflow quarkus create --extension quarkus-jsonp,quarkus-smallrye-openapi
----
