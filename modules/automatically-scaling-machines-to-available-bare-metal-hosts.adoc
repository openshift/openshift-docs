[id="automatically-scaling-machines-to-available-bare-metal-hosts_{context}"]
= Automatically scaling machines to the number of available bare metal hosts

To automatically create the number of `Machine` objects that matches the number of available `BareMetalHost` objects, add a `metal3.io/autoscale-to-hosts` annotation to the `MachineSet` object.

.Prerequisites

* Install {op-system} bare metal compute machines for use in the cluster, and create corresponding `BareMetalHost` objects.
* Install the {product-title} CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Annotate the machine set that you want to configure for automatic scaling by adding the `metal3.io/autoscale-to-hosts` annotation. Replace `<machineset>` with the name of the machine set.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api 'metal3.io/autoscale-to-hosts=<any_value>'
----
+
Wait for the new scaled machines to start.

[NOTE]
====
When you use a `BareMetalHost` object to create a machine in the cluster and labels or selectors are subsequently changed on the `BareMetalHost`, the `BareMetalHost` object continues be counted against the `MachineSet` that the `Machine` object was created from.
