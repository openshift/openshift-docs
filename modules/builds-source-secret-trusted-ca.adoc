= Creating a secret from source code trusted certificate authorities

The set of TLS certificate authorities (CA) that are trusted during a `git clone`
operation are built into the {product-title} infrastructure images. If your Git
server uses a self-signed certificate or one signed by an authority not trusted
by the image, you can create a secret that contains the certificate or disable
TLS verification.

If you create a secret for the `CA certificate`, {product-title} uses it to access
your Git server during the `git clone` operation. Using this method is
significantly more secure than disabling Git's SSL verification, which accepts
any TLS certificate that is presented.

.Procedure

* Create a secret with a CA certificate file.
.. If your CA uses Intermediate Certificate Authorities, combine the
certificates for all CAs in a *_ca.crt_* file. Run the following command:
+
----
$ cat intermediateCA.crt intermediateCA.crt rootCA.crt > ca.crt
----

.. Create the secret:
+
----
$ oc create secret generic mycert --from-file=ca.crt=</path/to/file> <1>
----
<1> You must use the key name *_ca.crt_*.
