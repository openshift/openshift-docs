= Creating source-to-image build in a network-restricted environment

[role="_abstract"] 

You can create a `source-to-image` build in a network-restricted environment by mirroring the images required by the `source-to-image` build strategy. 

.Prerequisites

* Your cluster can connect and interact with the git source that you can use to create the source-to-image build.
* You have the builder-image required to create the `source-to-image` build in your local registry. If you do not have the builder-image in the local registry, mirror the source image.

.Procedure

. Run the following command to mirror the images required by the `source-to-image` build strategy:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc image mirror --insecure -a <registry_authentication> registry.redhat.io/source-to-image/source-to-image-rhel8@sha256:d041c1bbe503d152d0759598f79802e257816d674b342670ef61c6f9e6d401c5 <mirror_registry>/<repo>/source-to-image-source-to-image-rhel8
----

. Perform the steps mentioned in the "Creating a source-to-image build" section.
