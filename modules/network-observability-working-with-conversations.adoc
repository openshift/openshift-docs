= Working with conversation tracking
As an administrator, you can you can group network flows that are part of the same conversation. A conversation is defined as a grouping of peers that are identified by their IP addresses, ports, and protocols, resulting in an unique *Conversation Id*. You can query conversation events in the web console. These events are represented in the web console as follows:

** *Conversation start*: This event happens when a connection is starting or TCP flag intercepted
** *Conversation tick*: This event happens at each specified interval defined in the `FlowCollector` `spec.processor.conversationHeartbeatInterval` parameter while the connection is active.
** *Conversation end*: This event happens when the `FlowCollector` `spec.processor.conversationEndTimeout` parameter is reached or  the TCP flag is intercepted.
** *Flow*: This is the network traffic flow that occurs within the specified interval.


.Procedure
. In the web console, navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
. Under the *Provided APIs* heading for the *NetObserv Operator*, select *Flow Collector*.
. Select *cluster* then select the *YAML* tab.
. Configure the `FlowCollector` custom resource so that `spec.processor.logTypes`, `conversationEndTimeout`, and `conversationHeartbeatInterval` parameters are set according to your observation needs. A sample configuration is as follows:

apiVersion: flows.netobserv.io/v1alpha1
kind: FlowCollector

 processor:
  conversationEndTimeout: 10s                  <1>
  logTypes: FLOWS                              <2>
  conversationHeartbeatInterval: 30s           <3>
----
<1> The *Conversation end* event represents the point when the `conversationEndTimeout` is reached or the TCP flag is intercepted.
<2> When `logTypes` is set to `FLOWS`, only the *Flow* event is exported. If you set the value to `ALL`, both conversation and flow events are exported and visible in the *Network Traffic* page. To focus only on conversation events, you can specify `CONVERSATIONS` which exports the *Conversation start*, *Conversation tick* and *Conversation end* events; or `ENDED_CONVERSATIONS` exports only the *Conversation end* events. Storage requirements are highest for `ALL` and lowest for `ENDED_CONVERSATIONS`.
<3> The *Conversation tick* event represents each specified interval defined in the `FlowCollector` `conversationHeartbeatInterval` parameter while the network connection is active.

[NOTE]
====
If you update the `logType` option, the flows from the previous selection do not clear from the console plugin. For example, if you initially set `logType` to `CONVERSATIONS` for a span of time until 10 AM and then move to `ENDED_CONVERSATIONS`, the console plugin shows all conversation events before 10 AM and only ended conversations after 10 AM.
====
. Refresh the *Network Traffic* page on the *Traffic flows* tab. Notice there are two new columns, *Event/Type* and *Conversation Id*. All the *Event/Type* fields are `Flow` when *Flow* is the selected query option.
. Select *Query Options* and choose the *Log Type*, *Conversation*. Now the *Event/Type* shows all of the desired conversation events.
. Next you can filter on a specific conversation ID or switch between the *Conversation* and *Flow* log type options from the side panel.
