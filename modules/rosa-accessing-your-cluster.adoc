[id="rosa-accessing-your-cluster_{context}"]
= Accessing your cluster with an IDP account

To log in to your cluster, you can configure an identity provider (IDP). This procedure uses GitHub as an example IDP. To view other supported IDPs, run the `rosa create idp --help` command.

[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, as the user who created the cluster, you can use the quick access procedure.
====

.Procedure

To access your cluster using an IDP account:

. Add an IDP.
.. The following command creates an IDP backed by GitHub. After running the command, follow the interactive prompts from the output to access your link:https://github.com/settings/developers[GitHub developer settings] and configure a new OAuth application.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create idp --cluster=<cluster_name> --interactive
----
+
.. Enter the following values:
+
--
* Type of identity provider: `github`
* Restrict to members of: `organizations` (if you do not have a GitHub Organization, you can create one now)
* GitHub organizations: `rh-test-org` (enter the name of your organization)
--
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
I: Interactive mode enabled.
Any optional fields can be left empty and a default will be selected.
? Type of identity provider: github
? Restrict to members of: organizations
? GitHub organizations: rh-test-org
? To use GitHub as an identity provider, you must first register the application:
  - Open the following URL:
    https://github.com/organizations/rh-rosa-test-cluster/settings/applications/new?oauth_application%5Bcallback_url%5D=https%3A%2F%2Foauth-openshift.apps.rh-rosa-test-cluster.z7v0.s1.devshift.org%2Foauth2callback%2Fgithub-1&oauth_application%5Bname%5D=rh-rosa-test-cluster-stage&oauth_application%5Burl%5D=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole-openshift-console.apps.rh-rosa-test-cluster.z7v0.s1.devshift.org
  - Click on 'Register application'
...
----
+
.. Follow the URL in the output and select *Register application* to register a new OAuth application in your GitHub organization. By registering the application, you enable the OAuth server that is built into ROSA to authenticate members of your GitHub organization into your cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
The fields in the *Register a new OAuth application* GitHub form are automatically filled with the required values through the URL that is defined by the {product-title} (ROSA) CLI, `rosa`.
====
.. Use the information from the GitHub application you created and continue the prompts. Enter the following values:
+
--
* Client ID: `&lt;my_github_client_id&gt;`
* Client Secret: [? for help] `&lt;my_github_client_secret&gt;`
* Hostname: (optional, you can leave it blank for now)
* Mapping method: `claim`
