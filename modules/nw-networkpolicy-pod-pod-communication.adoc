= Creating a pod-to-pod communication network policy

After you have created the `deny-by-default` network policy, you can create a network policy that allows pods to communicate with each other. The following sections show you how to create three different network policies:

* An `ingress-access` network policy, which allows specific pods to _receive_ traffic.
* An `allow-same-namespace` network policy, which allows pods within the same namespace to communicate with each other.
* An `allow-n1-a-to-n2-b` network policy, which allows pods across namespaces to communicate with each other.

Choose the network policy that best suits your needs.
