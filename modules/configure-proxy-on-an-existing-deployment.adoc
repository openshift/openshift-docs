= Configuring a proxy on an existing deployment

To configure a proxy in an existing deployment, you must export the `proxy-config` secret as a YAML file, update your proxy configuration in that file, and upload it as a secret.

[NOTE]
====
If a global proxy is configured on the OpenShift Container Platform cluster, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically configures Operators that it manages with the cluster-wide proxy. However, you can also configure installed Operators to override the global proxy or inject a custom CA certificate following [Configuring proxy support in Operator Lifecycle Manager](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/operators/admin/olm-configuring-proxy-support.html) procedure.
====

.Procedure

. Save the existing secret as a YAML file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n stackrox get secret proxy-config \
  -o go-template='{{index .data "config.yaml" | \
  base64decode}}{{"\n"}}' > /tmp/proxy-config.yaml
----
. Edit the fields you want to modify in the YAML configuration file, as specified in the Configure proxy during installation section.
//TODO Link to Configure proxy during installation section
. After you save the changes, run the following command to replace the secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n stackrox create secret generic proxy-config \
  --from-file=config.yaml=/tmp/proxy-config.yaml -o yaml --dry-run | \
  oc label -f - --local -o yaml app.kubernetes.io/name=stackrox | \
  oc apply -f -
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
* You must wait for at least 1 minute, until {ocp} propagates your changes to Central and Scanner.
* If you see any issues with outgoing connections after changing the proxy configuration, you must restart your Central and Scanner pods.

//TODO add link to restarting Central and Scanner
