= How custom certificate authorities work in {microshift-short}

The default API server certificate is issued by an internal {microshift-short} cluster certificate authority (CA). Clients outside of the cluster cannot verify the API server certificate by default. This certificate can be replaced by a custom server certificate that is issued externally by a custom CA that clients trust. The following steps illustrate the workflow in {microshift-short}:

. Copy the certificates and keys to the preferred directory in the host operating system. Ensure that the files are accessible by root only.

. Update the {microshift-short} configuration for each custom CA by specifying the certificate names and new fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in the {microshift-short} `/etc/microshift/config.yaml` configuration file.
+
Each certificate configuration can contain the following values:

** The certificate file location is a required value.
** A single common name containing the API server DNS and IP address or IP address range.
+

[TIP]
====
In most cases, {microshift-short} generates a new `kubeconfig` for your custom CA that includes the IP address or range that you specify. The exception is when wildcards are specified for the IP address. In this case, {microshift-short} generates a `kubeconfig` with the public IP address of the server. To use wildcards, you must update the `kubeconfig` file with your specific details.
====
--
** Multiple Subject Alternative Names (SANs) containing the API server DNS and IP addresses or a wildcard certificate.
** You can provide additional DNS names for each certificate.

. After the {microshift-short} service restarts, you must copy the generated `kubeconfig` files to the client.

. Configure additional CAs on the client system. For example, you can update CA bundles in the {op-system-base-full} truststore.

. The certificates and keys are read from the specified file location on the host. Testing and validation of configuration is done from the client.

. External server certificates are not automatically renewed. You must manually rotate your external certificates.

[NOTE]
====
If any validation fails, the {microshift-short} service skips the custom configuration and uses the default certificate to start. The priority is to continue the service uninterrupted. {microshift-short} logs errors when the service starts. Common errors include expired certificates, missing files, or incorrect IP addresses.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Custom server certificates have to be validated against CA data configured in the trust root of the host operating system.
