= Enabling log verbosity

You can enable a more verbose output by passing the `BUILD_LOGLEVEL` environment variable as part of the `sourceStrategy`
ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
or `dockerStrategy`
endif::[]
in a `BuildConfig`.

[NOTE]
====
An administrator can set the default build verbosity for the entire {product-title} instance by configuring `env/BUILD_LOGLEVEL`. This default can be overridden by specifying `BUILD_LOGLEVEL` in a given `BuildConfig`. You can specify a higher priority override on the command line for non-binary builds by passing `--build-loglevel` to `oc start-build`.
====

Available log levels for source builds are as follows:

[horizontal]
Level 0:: Produces output from containers running the `assemble` script and all encountered errors. This is the default.
Level 1:: Produces basic information about the executed process.
Level 2:: Produces very detailed information about the executed process.
Level 3:: Produces very detailed information about the executed process, and a listing of the archive contents.
Level 4:: Currently produces the same information as level 3.
Level 5:: Produces everything mentioned on previous levels and additionally provides docker push messages.

.Procedure

* To enable more verbose output, pass the `BUILD_LOGLEVEL` environment variable as part of the `sourceStrategy`
ifndef::openshift-online[]
or `dockerStrategy`
endif::[]
in a `BuildConfig`:

[source,yaml]
----
sourceStrategy:
...
  env:
    - name: "BUILD_LOGLEVEL"
      value: "2" <1>
----
<1> Adjust this value to the desired log level.
