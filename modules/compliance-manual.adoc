= Remediating a platform check manually

Checks for Platform scans typically have to be remediated manually by the administrator for two reasons:

* It is not always possible to automatically determine the value that must be set. One of the checks requires that a list of allowed registries is provided, but the scanner has no way of knowing which registries the organization wants to allow.

* Different checks modify different API objects, requiring automated remediation to possess `root` or superuser access to modify objects in the cluster, which is not advised.

.Procedure
. The example below uses the `ocp4-ocp-allowed-registries-for-import` rule, which would fail on a default {product-title} installation. Inspect the rule `oc get rule.compliance/ocp4-ocp-allowed-registries-for-import -oyaml`, the rule is to limit the registries the users are allowed to import images from by setting the `allowedRegistriesForImport` attribute, The _warning_ attribute of the rule also shows the API object checked, so it can be modified and remediate the issue:
