= Limiting scrape samples in user-defined projects

Labels are used to define attributes for metrics in the form of key-value pairs. A unique time series is created for every key-value pair. Adding many values to labels can result in an exponential increase in the number of time series created. This can impact Prometheus performance and can consume a lot of disk space.

You can prevent this by limiting the number of samples that can be accepted per target scrape in user-defined projects. You should also create alerts that fire when the target cannot be scraped or when a scrape sample threshold is reached.

[NOTE]
====
Limiting scrape samples can help prevent the issues caused by adding many unbound attributes to labels. However, you should also prevent the underlying cause by limiting the number of unbound attributes that you define for your metrics. Unbound attributes are those that can contain any possible value. Using attributes that are bound to a limited set of possible values reduces the number of potential key-value pair combinations.
