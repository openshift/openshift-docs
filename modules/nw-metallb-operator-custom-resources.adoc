= MetalLB Operator custom resources

The MetalLB Operator monitors its own namespace for two custom resources:

`MetalLB`::
When you add a `MetalLB` custom resource to the cluster, the MetalLB Operator deploys MetalLB on the cluster.
The Operator only supports a single instance of the custom resource.
If the instance is deleted, the Operator removes MetalLB from the cluster.

`AddressPool`::
MetalLB requires one or more pools of IP addresses that it can assign to a service when you add a service of type `LoadBalancer`.
When you add an `AddressPool` custom resource to the cluster, the MetalLB Operator configures MetalLB so that it can assign IP addresses from the pool.
An address pool includes a list of IP addresses.
The list can be a single IP address, a range specified in CIDR notation, a range specified as a starting and ending address separated by a hyphen, or a combination of the three.
An address pool requires a name.
The documentation uses names like `doc-example`, `doc-example-reserved`, and `doc-example-ipv6`.
An address pool specifies whether MetalLB can automatically assign IP addresses from the pool or whether the IP addresses are reserved for services that explicitly specify the pool by name.

After you add the `MetalLB` custom resource to the cluster and the Operator deploys MetalLB, the MetalLB software components, `controller` and `speaker`, begin running.
