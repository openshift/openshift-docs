= MetalLB Operator custom resources

The MetalLB Operator monitors its own namespace for the following custom resources:

`MetalLB`::
When you add a `MetalLB` custom resource to the cluster, the MetalLB Operator deploys MetalLB on the cluster.
The Operator only supports a single instance of the custom resource.
If the instance is deleted, the Operator removes MetalLB from the cluster.

`IPAddressPool`::
MetalLB requires one or more pools of IP addresses that it can assign to a service when you add a service of type `LoadBalancer`.
An `IPAddressPool` includes a list of IP addresses.
The list can be a single IP address that is set using a range, such as 1.1.1.1-1.1.1.1, a range specified in CIDR notation, a range specified as a starting and ending address separated by a hyphen, or a combination of the three.
An `IPAddressPool` requires a name.
The documentation uses names like `doc-example`, `doc-example-reserved`, and `doc-example-ipv6`.
The MetalLB `controller` assigns IP addresses from a pool of addresses in an `IPAddressPool`.
`L2Advertisement` and `BGPAdvertisement` custom resources enable the advertisement of a given IP from a given pool.
You can assign IP addresses from an `IPAddressPool` to services and namespaces by using the `spec.serviceAllocation` specification in the `IPAddressPool` custom resource.

[NOTE]
====
A single `IPAddressPool` can be referenced by a L2 advertisement and a BGP advertisement.
====

`BGPPeer`::
The BGP peer custom resource identifies the BGP router for MetalLB to communicate with, the AS number of the router, the AS number for MetalLB, and customizations for route advertisement.
MetalLB advertises the routes for service load-balancer IP addresses to one or more BGP peers.

`BFDProfile`::
The BFD profile custom resource configures Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for a BGP peer.
BFD provides faster path failure detection than BGP alone provides.

`L2Advertisement`::
The L2Advertisement custom resource advertises an IP coming from an `IPAddressPool` using the L2 protocol.

`BGPAdvertisement`::
The BGPAdvertisement custom resource advertises an IP coming from an `IPAddressPool` using the BGP protocol.

After you add the `MetalLB` custom resource to the cluster and the Operator deploys MetalLB, the `controller` and `speaker` MetalLB software components begin running.

MetalLB validates all relevant custom resources.
