= Pod information

The top of the *Knative Serving - Scaling Debugging* dashboard shows the counts of the requested pods, as well as of the pods in various stages of deployment. The *Revision Pod Counts (Timeline)* graph shows the same data visualized on the timeline. This information might be useful for general assessment of autoscaling by checking for problems with pod allocation.
