[id="policy-enforcement-deploy_{context}"]
= Deploy stage enforcement

{product-title} supports two forms of security policy enforcement for deploy-time policies: hard enforcement through the admission controller and soft enforcement by {product-title-short} Sensor. The admission controller blocks creation or updating of deployments that violate policy. If the admission controller is disabled or unavailable, Sensor can perform enforcement by scaling down replicas for deployments that violate policy to 0.

[WARNING]
====
Policy enforcement can impact running applications or development processes. Before you enable enforcement options, inform all stakeholders and plan how to respond to the automated enforcement actions.
