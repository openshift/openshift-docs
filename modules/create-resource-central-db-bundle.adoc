= Creating resources by using the Central DB provisioning bundle

[role="_abstract"]
Before you upgrade the Central cluster, you must use the Central DB provisioning bundle to create additional resources that the Central cluster requires. This bundle is a `tar` archive that has a README file, a few YAML configuration files, and some scripts that aid in the installation process.

.Prerequisites
* You must have generated a Central DB provisioning bundle.
* You must have extracted the `tar` archive bundle.

.Procedure
. Open the extracted bundle directory and run the `setup` script:

$ ./scripts/setup.sh
----
. Run the `deploy-central-db` script:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./scripts/deploy-central-db.sh
