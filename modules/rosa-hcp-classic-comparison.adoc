= Comparing ROSA with hosted control planes and ROSA Classic

{hcp-title-first} offers a different way to create a managed ROSA cluster. {hcp-title} offers a reduced-cost solution with focuses on reliability and efficiency. With a focus on efficiency, you can quickly create a new cluster and deploy applications in minutes. 

{hcp-title} requires only a minimum of two nodes making it ideal for smaller projects while still being able to scale to support larger projects and enterprises.

| Hosted Control Plane 
| Classic

| *What are each of the installation paths?*
| This installation path deploys control plane components, such as etcd, API server, and oauth, that are hosted separately on AWS in a Red Hat-owned and managed account. 
| This installation path deploys the control plane components side by side with infrastructure and worker nodes that are hosted together in the customer’s same AWS account.

| *Provisioning Time*
| Approximately 10 minutes 
| Approximately 40 minutes 

| *Architecture*
|
    * Underlying control plane infrastructure is fully managed and directly unavailable to end customers except through dedicated and explicitly exposed endpoints
|
    * Customer is responsible for hosting control plane and AWS infrastructure, while still being _managed_ by Red Hat
    * All-in-one {product-title} infrastructure architecture
    
| *Footprint*
| One cluster requires a minimum of two nodes
| One cluster requires a minimum of seven nodes

| *Deployment* 
| 
    * Deploy using ROSA CLI or web UI
    * Customers provision "Hosted Clusters" that deploy the control plane components into Red Hat's AWS account
    * Customers provision "Machine Pools" that deploy worker nodes into the customer's AWS account
|
    * Deploy using ROSA CLI or web UI
    * Full cluster provisioning occurs in customer's AWS account

| *Upgrades*
| Selectively upgrade control plane and machine pools separately
| Entire cluster is upgraded at one time
