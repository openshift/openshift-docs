= Comparing ROSA with hosted control planes and ROSA Classic

{hcp-title-first} offers a different way to create a managed {product-title} (ROSA) cluster. {hcp-title} offers a reduced-cost solution with focuses on reliability and efficiency. With a focus on efficiency, you can quickly create a new cluster and deploy applications in minutes.

{hcp-title} requires only a minimum of two nodes making it ideal for smaller projects while still being able to scale to support larger projects and enterprises.

| Hosted Control Plane
| Classic

| *Cluster infrastructure hosting*
| {hcp-title} deploys control plane components, such as etcd, API server, and oauth, that are hosted separately on AWS in a Red Hat-owned and managed account.
| ROSA Classic deploys the control plane components side by side with infrastructure and worker nodes that are hosted together in the customer’s same AWS account.

| *Provisioning Time*
| Approximately 10 minutes
| Approximately 40 minutes

| *Architecture*
|
    * Underlying control plane infrastructure is fully managed
    * Customer can access control plane infrastructure through dedicated and explicitly exposed endpoints
    * Worker nodes are hosted in the customer's AWS account
|
    * Customer is responsible for hosting control plane and AWS infrastructure, while still being _managed_ by Red Hat
    * Worker nodes are hosted in the customer's AWS account

| *Minimum Amazon EC2 footprint*
| One cluster requires a minimum of two nodes
| One cluster requires a minimum of seven nodes

| *Deployment*
|
    * Deploy using the ROSA CLI (`rosa`)
    * Customers provision "Hosted Clusters" that deploy the control plane components into Red Hat's AWS account
    * Customers provision "Machine Pools" that deploy worker nodes into the customer's AWS account
|
    * Deploy using the ROSA CLI or the web UI
    * Full cluster provisioning occurs in customer's AWS account

| *Upgrades*
| Selectively upgrade control plane and machine pools separately
| Entire cluster is upgraded at one time

| *Regional Availability*
|
* US East - N. Virginia (us-east-1)
* US East - Ohio (us-east-2)
* US West - Oregon (us-west-2)
* Africa - Cape Town (af-south-1)
* Asia Pacific - Hyderabad (ap-south-2)
* Asia Pacific - Jakarta (ap-southeast-3)
* Asia Pacific - Melbourne (ap-southeast-4)
* Asia Pacific - Mumbai (ap-south-1)
* Asia Pacific - Seoul (ap-northeast-2)
* Asia Pacific - Singapore (ap-southeast-1)

    * Compliance specifics are located in the {product-title} documentation.
