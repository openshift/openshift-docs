= Granting view permissions

{product-title} automatically creates several service accounts in every project. The `default` service account takes responsibility for running the pods. {product-title} uses and injects this service account into every pod that launches.

By default, the `default` service account has limited permissions to interact with the OpenShift API.

As a requirement of the application, you must assign the `view` role to the `default` service account to allow it to communicate with the OpenShift API to learn about pods, services, and resources within the project.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} cluster.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have `cluster-admin` or project-level `admin` privileges.

.Procedure

* Add the `view` role to the `default` service account in the `user-getting-started` project by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user view -z default -n user-getting-started
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are using a different project, replace `user-getting-started` with the name of your project.
