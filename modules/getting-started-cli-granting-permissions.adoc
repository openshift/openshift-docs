= Granting view permissions

{product-title} automatically creates a few special service accounts in every project. The default service account takes responsibility for running the pods. {product-title} uses and injects this service account into every pod that launches.

The following procedure creates a `RoleBinding` object for the default `ServiceAccount` object. The service account communicates with the {product-title} API to learn about pods, services, and resources within the project.

.Prerequisites

* You must have access to an {product-title} cluster.
* You must have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have a deployed image.
* You must have `cluster-admin` or `project-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

* To add the view role to the default service account in the `user-getting-started project`, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user view -z default -n user-getting-started
