= {op-system-bundle} installation steps

For most installation types, you must also take the following steps:

* Download the pull secret from the Red{nbsp}Hat Hybrid Cloud Console using the following link:

** link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Pull secret]

* Be ready to configure {microshift-short} by adding parameters and values to the {microshift-short} YAML configuration file. For more information, see the following link:

** link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_build_of_microshift/{ocp-version}/html/configuring/using-the-microshift-configuration-file[Using the {microshift-short} configuration file]

* Decide whether you need to configure storage for the application and tasks you are using in your {microshift-short} cluster, or disable the {microshift-short} storage plug-in completely.

* For more information about creating volume groups and persistent volumes on {op-system-base}, see the following link:

** link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/configuring_and_managing_logical_volumes/overview-of-logical-volume-management_configuring-and-managing-logical-volumes[Overview of logical volume management]

* Configure networking settings according to the access needs you plan for your {microshift-short} cluster and applications. Consider whether you want to use single or dual-stack networks, configure a firewall, or configure routes.

You can use the {op-system-rt-kernel} where predictable latency is critical. Workload partitioning is also required for low-latency applications. For more information about low latency and the {op-system-rtk}, see the following link:
