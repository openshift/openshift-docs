[id="mitigation-virtcontrollerdown_{context}"]
== Mitigation

This alert can have a variety of causes, including the following:

* Node resource exhaustion
* Not enough memory on the cluster
* Nodes are down
* The API server is overloaded. For example, the scheduler might be
under a heavy load and therefore not completely available.
* Networking issues

Identify the root cause and fix it, if possible.

If you cannot resolve the issue, log in to the
link:https://access.redhat.com[Customer Portal] and open a support case,
attaching the artifacts gathered during the diagnosis procedure.
