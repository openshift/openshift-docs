= Creating a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) aligned SR-IOV pod

You can create a NUMA aligned SR-IOV pod by restricting SR-IOV and the CPU resources allocated from the same NUMA node with `restricted` or `single-numa-node` Topology Manager polices.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have configured the CPU Manager policy to `static`. For more information on CPU Manager, see the "Additional resources" section.
* You have configured the Topology Manager policy to `single-numa-node`.
+
[NOTE]
====
When `single-numa-node` is unable to satisfy the request, you can configure the Topology Manager policy to `restricted`. For more flexible SR-IOV network resource scheduling, see _Excluding SR-IOV network topology during NUMA-aware scheduling_ in the _Additional resources_ section.
====

.Procedure

. Create the following SR-IOV pod spec, and then save the YAML in the `<name>-sriov-pod.yaml` file. Replace `<name>` with a name for this pod.
+
The following example shows an SR-IOV pod spec:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: sample-pod
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: <name> <1>
spec:
  containers:
  - name: sample-container
    image: <image> <2>
    command: ["sleep", "infinity"]
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "1Gi" <3>
        cpu: "2" <4>
      requests:
        memory: "1Gi"
        cpu: "2"
----
<1> Replace `<name>` with the name of the SR-IOV network attachment definition CR.
<2> Replace `<image>` with the name of the `sample-pod` image.
<3> To create the SR-IOV pod with guaranteed QoS, set `memory limits` equal to `memory requests`.
<4> To create the SR-IOV pod with guaranteed QoS, set `cpu limits` equals to `cpu requests`.

. Create the sample SR-IOV pod by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <filename> <1>
----
<1>  Replace `<filename>` with the name of the file you created in the previous step.

. Confirm that the `sample-pod` is configured with guaranteed QoS.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe pod sample-pod
----

. Confirm that the `sample-pod` is allocated with exclusive CPUs.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec sample-pod -- cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/cpuset.cpus
----

. Confirm that the SR-IOV device and CPUs that are allocated for the `sample-pod` are on the same NUMA node.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec sample-pod -- cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/cpuset.cpus
