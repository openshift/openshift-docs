= Assess exposure

[role="_abstract"]
To assess your exposure on a vulnerability you may want to answer the following questions:

* Is my application impacted by the vulnerability?
* Is this vulnerability mitigated by some other factor?
* Are there known threats that could lead to exploitation of this vulnerability?
* Am I using this software package?
* Is it worth my time to answer one or more of these questions?

You may want to take some of the following actions based on your assessment:

* Consider marking the vulnerability as a false positive you determine that there is no exposure or that the vulnerability does not apply in your environment.
* Consider if you would prefer to remediate, mitigate or accept the risk if you are exposed.
* Consider if you want to remove or change the software package in order to reduce your attack surface. 

To understand if you are using a software package in a deployment as you assess if you want to remove the package you can view the {product-title} infered state of the component.

The states are:
* *Active*: A software component is identified as actively by a proccess in the application. 
* *Inactive*: This software component is not used by an active proccess in the application.
* *Undetermined*: {product-title} can not determine if this proccess is used.
