= Assessing the exposure

[role="_abstract"]
To assess your exposure to a vulnerability, answer the following questions:

* Is your application impacted by a vulnerability?
* Is the vulnerability mitigated by some other factor?
* Are there any known threats that could lead to the exploitation of this vulnerability?
* Are you using the software package which has the vulnerability?
* Is spending time on a specific vulnerability and the software package worth it?

Take some of the following actions based on your assessment:

* Consider marking the vulnerability as a false positive if you determine that there is no exposure or that the vulnerability does not apply in your environment.
* Consider if you would prefer to remediate, mitigate or accept the risk if you are exposed.
* Consider if you want to remove or change the software package to reduce your attack surface.
