|Parameter|Description|Values

|`networking.clusterNetwork.cidr`
|A block of IP addresses from which pod IPs are allocated. {product-title} uses
CIDR to allocate IP addresses. The 'OpenShiftSDN' network plug-in supports
multiple `clusterNetworks`. The address blocks for multiple `clusterNetworks`
must not overlap. Select address pools large enough to fit your anticipated
workload.
|An IP address allocation in CIDR format. The default value is `10.128.0.0/14`.

|`networking.clusterNetwork.hostPrefix`
|The subnet prefix length to assign to each individual node. For example, if
`hostPrefix` is set to `23`, then each node is assigned a `/23` subnet out of
the given `cidr`, allowing for 510 (2^(32 - 23) - 2) pod IP addresses.
|A subnet prefix. The default value is `23`.

|`networking.machineCIDR`
|A block of IP addresses for the node's network.
|An IP address allocation in CIDR format. The default value is `10.0.0.0/16`

|`networking.serviceNetwork`
|A block of IP addresses for services. `OpenShiftSDN`
allows only one `serviceNetwork` block.
|An IP address allocation in CIDR format. The default value is `172.30.0.0/16`

|`networking.networkType`
|The Network plug-in to deploy. `OpenShiftSDN` is the only plug-in
supported in {product-title} {product-version}.
|`OpenShiftSDN`
