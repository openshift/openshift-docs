= Configuring distributed tracing security for service mesh from the command line

You can modify the Jaeger resource to configure {JaegerShortName} security for use with {SMproductShortName} from the command line by running the {oc-first}.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. If you use {product-dedicated}, you must have an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.
* The {SMProductName} Operator must be installed.
* The `ServiceMeshControlPlane` deployed to the cluster.
* You have access to the {oc-first} that matches your {product-title} version.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {oc-first} as a user with the `cluster-admin` role by running the following command. If you use {product-dedicated}, you must have an account with the `dedicated-admin` role.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login https://<HOSTNAME>:6443
----
+
. Change to the project where you installed the control plane, for example `istio-system`, by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project istio-system
----
+
. Run the following command to edit the Jaeger custom resource file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit -n openshift-distributed-tracing -f jaeger.yaml
----
+
. Edit the `Jaeger` custom resource file to add the `htpasswd` configuration as shown in the following example.

* `spec.ingress.openshift.htpasswdFile`
* `spec.volumes`
* `spec.volumeMounts`
+
