| Number of namespaces footnoteref:[numberofnamepaces, When there are a large number of active projects, etcd may suffer from poor performance if the keyspace grows excessively large and exceeds the space quota. Periodic maintenance of etcd, including defragmentaion, is highly recommended to free etcd storage.]

| Number of pods per namespace footnoteref:[objectpernamespace,There are
a number of control loops in the system that must iterate over all objects
in a given namespace as a reaction to some changes in state. Having a large
number of objects of a given type in a single namespace can make those loops
expensive and slow down processing given state changes. The limit assumes that
the system has enough CPU, memory, and disk to satisfy the application requirements.]
