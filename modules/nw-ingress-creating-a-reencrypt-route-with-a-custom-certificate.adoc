= Creating a re-encrypt route with a custom certificate

[role="_abstract"]
To secure traffic by using a custom certificate, configure a route with re-encrypt TLS termination by running the `oc create route` command. This configuration enables the Ingress Controller to decrypt traffic, and then re-encrypt traffic before forwarding the traffic to the destination pod.

The procedure creates a `Route` resource with a custom certificate and reencrypt TLS termination. The procedure assumes that the certificate/key pair are in the `tls.crt` and `tls.key` files in the current working directory. You must also specify a destination CA certificate to enable the Ingress Controller to trust the service's certificate. You may also specify a CA certificate if needed to complete the certificate chain. Substitute the actual path names for `tls.crt`, `tls.key`, `cacert.crt`, and (optionally) `ca.crt`. Substitute the name of the `Service` resource that you want to expose for `frontend`. Substitute the appropriate hostname for `www.example.com`.

.Prerequisites

* You must have a certificate/key pair in PEM-encoded files, where the certificate is valid for the route host.
* You may have a separate CA certificate in a PEM-encoded file that completes the certificate chain.
* You must have a separate destination CA certificate in a PEM-encoded file.
* You must have a service that you want to expose.

[NOTE]
====
Password protected key files are not supported. To remove a passphrase from a key file, use the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ openssl rsa -in password_protected_tls.key -out tls.key
----
====

.Procedure

* Create a secure `Route` resource using reencrypt TLS termination and a custom certificate:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create route reencrypt --service=frontend --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key --dest-ca-cert=destca.crt --ca-cert=ca.crt --hostname=www.example.com
----
+
If you examine the resulting `Route` resource, the resource should have a configuration similar to the following example:
+
