= Creating a re-encrypt route with a custom certificate

You can configure a secure route using reencrypt TLS termination with a custom
certificate by using the `oc create route` command.

.Prerequisites

* You must have a certificate/key pair in PEM-encoded files, where the certificate
is valid for the route host.

* You may have a separate CA certificate in a PEM-encoded file that completes
the certificate chain.

* You must have a separate destination CA certificate in a PEM-encoded file.

* You must have a Service resource that you want to expose.

[NOTE]
====
Password protected key files are not supported. To remove a passphrase from a
key file, use the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ openssl rsa -in password_protected_tls.key -out tls.key
----
====

.Procedure

This procedure creates a `Route` resource with a custom certificate and
reencrypt TLS termination. The following assumes that the certificate/key pair
are in the `tls.crt` and `tls.key` files in the current working directory. You
must also specify a destination CA certificate to enable the Ingress Controller
to trust the service's certificate. You may also specify a CA certificate if
needed to complete the certificate chain. Substitute the actual path names for
`tls.crt`, `tls.key`, `cacert.crt`, and (optionally) `ca.crt`. Substitute the
name of the `Service` resource that you want to expose for `frontend`.
Substitute the appropriate host name for `www.example.com`.

* Create a secure `Route` resource using reencrypt TLS termination and a custom
certificate:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create route reencrypt --service=frontend --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key --dest-ca-cert=destca.crt --ca-cert=ca.crt --hostname=www.example.com
----
+
If you examine the resulting `Route` resource, it should look similar to the
following:
+
.YAML Definition of the Secure Route
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  host: www.example.com
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: frontend
  tls:
    termination: reencrypt
    key: |-
