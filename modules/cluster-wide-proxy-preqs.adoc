= Prerequisites for configuring a cluster-wide proxy

To configure a cluster-wide proxy, you must meet the following requirements. These requirements are valid when you configure a proxy during installation or postinstallation.


[id="cluster-wide-proxy-general-prereqs_{context}"]
== General requirements

* You are the cluster owner.
* Your account has sufficient privileges.
ifdef::openshift-rosa,openshift-rosa-hcp[]
* You have an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for your cluster.
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-rosa-hcp[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
* You have an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for your cluster.
* You are using the Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) model for your cluster.
endif::openshift-dedicated[]
* The proxy can access the VPC for the cluster and the private subnets of the VPC. The proxy must also be accessible from the VPC for the cluster and from the private subnets of the VPC.
* You have added the following endpoints to your VPC endpoint:
** `ec2.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com`
** `elasticloadbalancing.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com`
** `s3.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com`
+
These endpoints are required to complete requests from the nodes to the AWS EC2 API. Because the proxy works at the container level and not at the node level, you must route these requests to the AWS EC2 API through the AWS private network. Adding the public IP address of the EC2 API to your allowlist in your proxy server is not enough.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using a cluster-wide proxy, you must configure the `s3.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com` endpoint as type `Gateway`.

== Network requirements

If your proxy re-encrypts egress traffic, you must create exclusions to several domain and port combinations required by OpenShift.

Your proxy must exclude re-encrypting the following OpenShift URLs:

|The https://console.redhat.com/openshift site uses authentication from `sso.redhat.com` to download the cluster pull secret and use Red Hat SaaS solutions to facilitate monitoring of your subscriptions, cluster inventory, and chargeback reporting.
