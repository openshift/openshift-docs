= Installing VirtIO drivers from a container disk added as a SATA CD drive

You can install VirtIO drivers from a container disk that you add to a Windows virtual machine (VM) as a SATA CD drive.

[TIP]
====
Downloading the `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk from the link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/search?q=virtio-win&p=1[Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog] is not mandatory, because the container disk is downloaded from the Red Hat registry if it not already present in the cluster. However, downloading reduces the installation time.
====

.Prerequisites

* You must have access to the Red Hat registry or to the downloaded `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk in a restricted environment.

.Procedure

. Add the `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk as a CD drive by editing the `VirtualMachine` manifest:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  domain:
    devices:
      disks:
        - name: virtiocontainerdisk
          bootOrder: 2 <1>
          cdrom:
            bus: sata
volumes:
  - containerDisk:
      image: container-native-virtualization/virtio-win
    name: virtiocontainerdisk
----
<1> {VirtProductName} boots the VM disks in the order defined in the `VirtualMachine` manifest. You can either define other VM disks that boot before the `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk or use the optional `bootOrder` parameter to ensure the VM boots from the correct disk. If you configure the boot order for a disk, you must configure the boot order for the other disks.

. Apply the changes:
* If the VM is not running, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ virtctl start <vm>
----

* If the VM is running, reboot the VM or run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <vm.yaml>
----

. After the VM has started, install the VirtIO drivers from the SATA CD drive.
