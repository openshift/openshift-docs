= Adjusting Kuryr ports pool settings in active deployments on {rh-openstack}

You can use a custom resource (CR) to configure how Kuryr manages {rh-openstack-first} Neutron ports to control the speed and efficiency of pod creation on a deployed cluster.

.Procedure

. From a command line, open the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) CR for editing:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit networks.operator.openshift.io cluster
----

. Edit the settings to meet your requirements. The following file is provided as an example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  clusterNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
    hostPrefix: 23
  serviceNetwork:
  - 172.30.0.0/16
  defaultNetwork:
    type: Kuryr
    kuryrConfig:
      enablePortPoolsPrepopulation: false <1>
      poolMinPorts: 1 <2>
      poolBatchPorts: 3 <3>
      poolMaxPorts: 5 <4>
----
<1> Set `enablePortPoolsPrepopulation` to `true` to make Kuryr create Neutron ports when the first pod that is configured to use the dedicated network for pods is created in a namespace. This setting raises the Neutron ports quota but can reduce the time that is required to spawn pods. The default value is `false`.
<2> Kuryr creates new ports for a pool if the number of free ports in that pool is lower than the value of `poolMinPorts`. The default value is `1`.
<3> `poolBatchPorts` controls the number of new ports that are created if the number of free ports is lower than the value of `poolMinPorts`. The default value is `3`.
<4> If the number of free ports in a pool is higher than the value of `poolMaxPorts`, Kuryr deletes them until the number matches that value. Setting the value to `0` disables this upper bound, preventing pools from shrinking. The default value is `0`.

. Save your changes and quit the text editor to commit your changes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Modifying these options on a running cluster forces the kuryr-controller and kuryr-cni pods to restart. As a result, the creation of new pods and services will be delayed.
