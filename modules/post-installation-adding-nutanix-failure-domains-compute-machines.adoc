= Distributing compute machines across failure domains

You can distribute compute machines across Nutanix failure domains by performing either of the following tasks:

* Modifying existing compute machine sets.
* Creating new compute machine sets.

The following procedure details how to distribute compute machines across failure domains by modifying existing compute machine sets. For more information on creating a compute machine set, see "Additional resources".

.Prerequisites

* You have configured the failure domains in the cluster's Infrastructure custom resource (CR).

.Procedure

. Run the following command to view the cluster's Infrastructure CR.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe infrastructures.config.openshift.io cluster
----
. For each failure domain (`platformSpec.nutanix.failureDomains`), note the cluster's UUID, name, and subnet object UUID. These values are required to add a failure domain to a compute machine set.
. List the compute machine sets in your cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api
----
. Edit the first compute machine set by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineset <machineset_name> -n openshift-machine-api
----
. Configure the compute machine set to use the first failure domain by adding the following to the `spec.template.spec.providerSpec.value` stanza:
+
[NOTE]
====
Be sure that the values you specify for the `cluster` and `subnets` fields match the values that were configured in the `failureDomains` stanza in the cluster's Infrastructure CR.

. Note the value of `spec.replicas`, as you need it when scaling the machine set to apply the changes.
. Save your changes.
. List the machines that are managed by the updated compute machine set by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get -n openshift-machine-api machines -l machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machineset=<machine_set_name>
----
. For each machine that is managed by the updated compute machine set, set the `delete` annotation by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate machine/<machine_name_original_1> \
  -n openshift-machine-api \
  machine.openshift.io/delete-machine="true"
----
. Scale the compute machine set to twice the number of replicas by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=<twice_the_number_of_replicas> \// <1>
  machineset <machine_set_name> \
  -n openshift-machine-api
----
<1> For example, if the original number of replicas in the compute machine set is `2`, scale the replicas to `4`.
. List the machines that are managed by the updated compute machine set by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get -n openshift-machine-api machines -l machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machineset=<machine_set_name>
----
+
When the new machines are in the `Running` phase, you can scale the compute machine set to the original number of replicas.
. Scale the compute machine set to the original number of replicas by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=<original_number_of_replicas> \// <1>
  machineset <machine_set_name> \
  -n openshift-machine-api
----
<1> For example, if the original number of replicas in the compute machine set is `2`, scale the replicas to `2`.
. As required, continue to modify machine sets to reference the additional failure domains that are available to the deployment.
