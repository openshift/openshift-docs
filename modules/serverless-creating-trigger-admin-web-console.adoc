= Creating a trigger by using the Administrator perspective

Using the {ocp-product-title} web console provides a streamlined and intuitive user interface to create a trigger. After Knative Eventing is installed on your cluster and you have created a broker, you can create a trigger by using the web console.


.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Eventing are installed on your {ocp-product-title} cluster.

* You have logged in to the web console.

* You have cluster administrator permissions on {ocp-product-title}, or you have cluster or dedicated administrator permissions on {rosa-product-title} or {dedicated-product-title}.

* You have created a Knative broker.

* You have created a Knative service to use as a subscriber.

.Procedure

. In the {ocp-product-title} web console, navigate to *Serverless* -> *Eventing*.
. In the *Broker* tab, select the Options menu {kebab} for the broker that you want to add a trigger to.
. Click *Add Trigger* in the list.
. In the *Add Trigger* dialogue box, select a *Subscriber* for the trigger. The subscriber is the Knative service that will receive events from the broker.
. Click *Add*.
