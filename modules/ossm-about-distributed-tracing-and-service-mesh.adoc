Integrating {DTProductName} with {SMProductName} is made of up two parts: {TempoName} and {OTELName}.

{TempoName}:: Provides distributed tracing to monitor and troubleshoot transactions in complex distributed systems. Tempo is based on the open source link:https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/[Grafana Tempo] project.

For more about information about {temposhortname}, its features, installation, and configuration, see: link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/latest/html/distributed_tracing/distr-tracing-tempo-architecture[{TempoName}].

{OTELName}:: Is based on the open source link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry project], which aims to provide unified, standardized, and vendor-neutral telemetry data collection for cloud-native software. {OTELName} product provides support for deploying and managing the OpenTelemetry Collector and simplifying the workload instrumentation.
+
The link:https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/[OpenTelemetry Collector] can receive, process, and forward telemetry data in many formats, making it the ideal component for telemetry processing and interoperability between telemetry systems. The Collector provides a unified solution for collecting and processing metrics, traces, and logs.
