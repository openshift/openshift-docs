= Reissuing internal certificates for Scanner

Scanner has a built-in certificate that it uses to communicate with Central.

The {product-title-short} portal shows an information banner when the Scanner certificate is about to expire.

[NOTE]
====
The information banner only appears 15 days before the certificate expiry date.
