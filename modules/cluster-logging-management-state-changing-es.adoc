= Changing the Elasticsearch management state

You must set the operator to the _unmanaged_ state in order to modify the Elasticsearch deployment files, which are managed by the Elasticsearch Operator. 

If you make changes to these components in managed state, the Elasticsearch Operator reverts those changes. 

[NOTE]
====
An unmanaged Elasticsearch cluster does not receive updates until you return the Elasticsearch Operator to Managed state.
====

.Prerequisite

* The Elasticsearch Operator must be installed.

* Have the name of the `Elasticsearch` CR, in the `openshift-logging` project:
+
----
$ oc get -n openshift-logging Elasticsearch
NAME            AGE
elasticsearch   28h
----

.Procedure

Edit the `Elasticsearch`(CR) in the `openshift-logging` project:

[source,yaml]
----
$ oc edit Elasticsearch elasticsearch

apiVersion: logging.openshift.io/v1
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  name: elasticsearch


....

spec:
  managementState: "Managed" <1>
----

<1> Specify the management state as `Managed` or `Unmanaged`.

[NOTE]
====
If you set the Elasticsearch Operator (EO) to unmanaged and leave the Cluster Logging Operator (CLO) as managed, the CLO will revert changes you make to the EO, as the EO is managed by the CLO.
