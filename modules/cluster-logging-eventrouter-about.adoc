= About event routing

The Event Router is a pod that watches {product-title} events so they can be collected by the {logging-title}.
The Event Router collects events from all projects and writes them to `STDOUT`. Fluentd collects those events and forwards them into the {product-title} Elasticsearch instance. Elasticsearch indexes the events to the `infra` index.

You must manually deploy the Event Router.
