= OpenShift installation with NBDE

Network-Bound Disk Encryption (NBDE) must be enabled when an OpenShift node is installed. However, you can change the disk encryption policy at any time after it was initialized at installation.

To learn how to enable Tang mode disk encryption during an {product-title} (OCP) installation see: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/installing/install_config/installing-customizing.html#installation-special-config-encrypt-disk-tang_installing-customizing[Enabling Tang disk encryption].
