= Preparing to deploy {hcp} on non-bare metal agent machines

As you prepare to deploy {hcp} on bare metal, consider the following information:

* You can add agent machines as a worker node to a hosted cluster by using the Agent platform. Agent machine represents a host booted with a Discovery Image and ready to be provisioned as an {product-title} node. The Agent platform is part of the central infrastructure management service. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.11/html/clusters/cluster_mce_overview#enable-cim[Enabling the central infrastructure management service].

* All hosts that are not bare metal require a manual boot with a Discovery Image ISO that the central infrastructure management provides.

* When you scale up the node pool, a machine is created for every replica. For every machine, the Cluster API provider finds and installs an Agent that is approved, is passing validations, is not currently in use, and meets the requirements that are specified in the node pool specification. You can monitor the installation of an Agent by checking its status and conditions.

* When you scale down a node pool, Agents are unbound from the corresponding cluster. Before you can reuse the Agents, you must restart them by using the Discovery image.

* When you configure storage for {hcp}, consider the recommended etcd practices. To ensure that you meet the latency requirements, dedicate a fast storage device to all {hcp} etcd instances that run on each control-plane node. You can use LVM storage to configure a local storage class for hosted etcd pods. For more information, see "Recommended etcd practices" and "Persistent storage using logical volume manager storage" in the {product-title} documentation.
