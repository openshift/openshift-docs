= Schemas

File-based catalogs use a format, based on the link:https://cuelang.org/docs/references/spec/[CUE language specification], that can be extended with arbitrary schemas. The following  `_Meta` CUE schema defines the format that all file-based catalog blobs must adhere to:

.`_Meta` schema
[source,go]
----
_Meta: {
  // schema is required and must be a non-empty string
  schema: string & !=""

  // package is optional, but if it's defined, it must be a non-empty string
  package?: string & !=""

  // properties is optional, but if it's defined, it must be a list of 0 or more properties
  properties?: [... #Property]
}

#Property: {
  // type is required
  type: string & !=""

  // value is required, and it must not be null
  value: !=null
}
----

[NOTE]
====
No CUE schemas listed in this specification should be considered exhaustive. The `opm validate` command has additional validations that are difficult or impossible to express concisely in CUE.
====

An Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) catalog currently uses three schemas (`olm.package`, `olm.channel`, and `olm.bundle`), which correspond to OLM's existing package and bundle concepts.

Each Operator package in a catalog requires exactly one `olm.package` blob, at least one `olm.channel` blob, and one or more `olm.bundle` blobs.

[NOTE]
====
All `olm.*` schemas are reserved for OLM-defined schemas. Custom schemas must use a unique prefix, such as a domain that you own.
