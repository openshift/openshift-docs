= Schemas

File-based catalogs use a format, based on the link:https://cuelang.org/docs/references/spec/[CUE language specification], that can be extended with arbitrary schemas. The following  `_Meta` CUE schema defines the format that all file-based catalog blobs must adhere to:

.`_Meta` schema
[source,go]
----
_Meta: {
  // schema is required and must be a non-empty string
  schema: string & !=""

  // package is optional, but if it's defined, it must be a non-empty string
  package?: string & !=""

  // properties is optional, but if it's defined, it must be a list of 0 or more properties
  properties?: [... #Property]
}

#Property: {
  // type is required
  type: string & !=""

  // value is required, and it must not be null
  value: !=null
}
----

[NOTE]
====
No CUE schemas listed in this specification should be considered exhaustive. The `opm validate` command has additional validations that are difficult or impossible to express concisely in CUE.
====

An Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) catalog currently uses three schemas (`olm.package`, `olm.channel`, and `olm.bundle`), which correspond to OLM's existing package and bundle concepts.

Each Operator package in a catalog requires exactly one `olm.package` blob, at least one `olm.channel` blob, and one or more `olm.bundle` blobs.

[NOTE]
====
All `olm.*` schemas are reserved for OLM-defined schemas. Custom schemas must use a unique prefix, such as a domain that you own.

[id="olm-fb-catalogs-package-schema_{context}"]
== olm.package schema

The `olm.package` schema defines package-level metadata for an Operator. This includes its name, description, default channel, and icon.

[source,go]
----
#Package: {
  schema: "olm.package"

  // Package name
  name: string & !=""

  // A description of the package
  description?: string

  // The package's default channel
  defaultChannel: string & !=""

  // An optional icon
  icon?: {
    base64data: string
    mediatype:  string
  }
}

[id="olm-fb-catalogs-channel-schema_{context}"]
== olm.channel schema

The `olm.channel` schema defines a channel within a package, the bundle entries that are members of the channel, and the upgrade edges for those bundles.

A bundle can included as an entry in multiple `olm.channel` blobs, but it can have only one entry per channel.

It is valid for an entry's replaces value to reference another bundle name that cannot be found in this catalog or another catalog. However, all other channel invariants must hold true, such as a channel not having multiple heads.

.`olm.channel` schema

[source,go]
----
#Channel: {
  schema: "olm.channel"
  package: string & !=""
  name: string & !=""
  entries: [...#ChannelEntry]
}

#ChannelEntry: {
  // name is required. It is the name of an `olm.bundle` that
  // is present in the channel.
  name: string & !=""

  // replaces is optional. It is the name of bundle that is replaced
  // by this entry. It does not have to be present in the entry list.
  replaces?: string & !=""

  // skips is optional. It is a list of bundle names that are skipped by
  // this entry. The skipped bundles do not have to be present in the
  // entry list.
  skips?: [...string & !=""]

  // skipRange is optional. It is the semver range of bundle versions
  // that are skipped by this entry.
  skipRange?: string & !=""
}
----
====

[WARNING]
====
When using the `skipRange` field, the skipped Operator versions are pruned from the update graph and are therefore no longer installable by users with the `spec.startingCSV` property of `Subscription` objects.

If you want to have direct (one version increment) updates to an Operator version from multiple previous versions, and also keep those previous versions available to users for installation, always use the `skipRange` field along with the `replaces` field. Ensure that the `replaces` field points to the immediate previous version of the Operator version in question.
