= Installing the Elasticsearch Operator

The default Jaeger deployment uses in-memory storage because it is designed to be installed quickly for those evaluating Jaeger, giving demonstrations, or using Jaeger in a test environment.  If you plan to use Jaeger in production, you must install a persistent storage option, in this case, Elasticsearch.

.Prerequisites
* Access to the {product-title} web console.
* An account with the `cluster-admin` role.

[WARNING]
====
Do not install Community versions of the Operators. Community Operators are not supported.
====

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

. Type *Elasticsearch* into the filter box to locate the Elasticsearch Operator.

. Click the *Elasticsearch Operator* provided by Red Hat to display information about the Operator.

. Click *Install*.

. On the *Create Operator Subscription* page, select *All namespaces on the cluster (default)*. This installs the Operator in the default `openshift-operators` project and makes the Operator available to all projects in the cluster.

. Select the Update Channel that matches your {product-title} installation.  For example, if you are installing on {product-title} version 4.4, select the 4.4 update channel.

. Select the *Automatic* Approval Strategy.

[NOTE]
====
The Manual approval strategy requires a user with appropriate credentials to approve the Operator install and subscription process.
====

. Click *Subscribe*.

. On the *Installed Operators* page, select the `openshift-operators` project. Wait until you see that the Elasticsearch Operator shows a status of "InstallSucceeded" before continuing.
