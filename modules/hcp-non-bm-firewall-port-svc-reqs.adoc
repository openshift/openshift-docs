= Firewall, port, and service requirements for non-bare metal agent machines

You must meet the firewall and port requirements so that ports can communicate between the management cluster, the control plane, and hosted clusters.

[NOTE]
====
Services run on their default ports. However, if you use the `NodePort` publishing strategy, services run on the port that is assigned by the `NodePort` service.
====

Use firewall rules, security groups, or other access controls to restrict access to only required sources. Avoid exposing ports publicly unless necessary. For production deployments, use a load balancer to simplify access through a single IP address.

A hosted control plane exposes the following services on non-bare metal agent machines:

* `APIServer`

** The `APIServer` service runs on port 6443 by default and requires ingress access for communication between the control plane components.
** If you use MetalLB load balancing, allow ingress access to the IP range that is used for load balancer IP addresses.

* `OAuthServer`

** The `OAuthServer` service runs on port 443 by default when you use the route and ingress to expose the service.
** If you use the `NodePort` publishing strategy, use a firewall rule for the `OAuthServer` service.

* `Konnectivity`

** The `Konnectivity` service runs on port 443 by default when you use the route and ingress to expose the service.
** The `Konnectivity` agent establishes a reverse tunnel to allow the control plane to access the network for the hosted cluster. The agent uses egress to connect to the `Konnectivity` server. The server is exposed by using either a route on port 443 or a manually assigned `NodePort`.
** If the cluster API server address is an internal IP address, allow access from the workload subnets to the IP address on port 6443.
** If the address is an external IP address, allow egress on port 6443 to that external IP address from the nodes.

* `Ignition`

** The `Ignition` service runs on port 443 by default when you use the route and ingress to expose the service.
** If you use the `NodePort` publishing strategy, use a firewall rule for the `Ignition` service.

You do not need the following services on non-bare metal agent machines:

* `OVNSbDb`
* `OIDC`
