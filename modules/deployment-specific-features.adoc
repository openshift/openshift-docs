[id="deployment-specific-features-rollover_{context}"]
== Rollover

The deployment process for `Deployment` objects is driven by a controller loop, in contrast to `DeploymentConfig` objects that use deployer pods for every new rollout. This means that the `Deployment` object can have as many active replica sets as possible, and eventually the deployment controller will scale down all old replica sets and scale up the newest one.

`DeploymentConfig` objects can have at most one deployer pod running, otherwise multiple deployers might conflict when trying to scale up what they think should be the newest replication controller. Because of this, only two replication controllers can be active at any point in time. Ultimately, this results in faster rapid rollouts for `Deployment` objects.

[id="deployment-specific-features-proportional-scaling_{context}"]
== Proportional scaling

Because the deployment controller is the sole source of truth for the sizes of new and old replica sets owned by a `Deployment` object, it can scale ongoing rollouts. Additional replicas are distributed proportionally based on the size of each replica set.

`DeploymentConfig` objects cannot be scaled when a rollout is ongoing because the controller will have issues with the deployer process about the size of the new replication controller.

[id="deployment-specific-features-pausing-mid-rollout_{context}"]
== Pausing mid-rollout

Deployments can be paused at any point in time, meaning you can also pause ongoing rollouts. However, you currently cannot pause deployer pods; if you try to pause a deployment in the middle of a rollout, the deployer process is not affected and continues until it finishes.
