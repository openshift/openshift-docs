= Installing Kafka (optional)

[role="_abstract"]
The Kafka Operator is supported for large-scale environments. Kafka provides high-throughput and low-latency data feeds for forwarding network flow data in a more resilient, scalable way.

You can install the Kafka Operator as link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq_streams/2.2[Red Hat AMQ Streams] from the Operator Hub, just as the {loki-op} and Network Observability Operator were installed. Refer to "Configuring the FlowCollector resource with Kafka" to configure Kafka as a storage option.

[NOTE]
====
To uninstall Kafka, refer to the uninstallation process that corresponds with the method you used to install.
