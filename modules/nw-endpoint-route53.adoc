[id="nw-endpoint-route53_{context}"]
= Ingress Operator endpoint configuration for AWS Route 53

If you install in either Amazon Web Services (AWS) GovCloud (US) US-West or US-East region, the Ingress Operator uses `us-gov-west-1` region for Route53 and tagging API clients.

The Ingress Operator uses `https://tagging.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com` as the tagging API endpoint if a tagging custom endpoint is configured that includes the string 'us-gov-east-1'.

For more information on AWS GovCloud (US) endpoints, see the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/using-govcloud-endpoints.html[Service Endpoints] in the AWS documentation about GovCloud (US).

[IMPORTANT]
====
Private, disconnected installations are not supported for AWS GovCloud when you install in the `us-gov-east-1` region.
