= Installing RHEL on the provisioner node

With the networking configuration complete, the next step is to install {op-system-base} 8.1 on the provisioner node. The installer uses the provisioner node as the orchestrator while installing the {product-title} cluster on the three control plane nodes and the at least two worker nodes. For the purposes of this document, installing RHEL on the provisioner node is out of scope. However, options include but are not limited to using a RHEL Satellite server, PXE, or installation media.
