It is not recommended to store binary files in a source repository. Therefore, you must define a build which pulls additional files, such as Java `.jar` dependencies, during the build process. How this is done depends on the build strategy you are using.

For a Source build strategy, you must put appropriate shell commands into the `assemble` script:

.`.s2i/bin/assemble` File
[source,terminal]
----
#!/bin/sh
APP_VERSION=1.0
wget http://repository.example.com/app/app-$APP_VERSION.jar -O app.jar
----

.`.s2i/bin/run` File
[source,terminal]
----
#!/bin/sh
exec java -jar app.jar
----

ifndef::openshift-builds-v1[]
For a Docker build strategy, you must modify the Dockerfile and invoke
shell commands with the link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run[`RUN` instruction]:

.Excerpt of Dockerfile
[source,terminal]
----
FROM jboss/base-jdk:8

ENV APP_VERSION 1.0
RUN wget http://repository.example.com/app/app-$APP_VERSION.jar -O app.jar

EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "java", "-jar", "app.jar" ]
----
endif::[]

In practice, you may want to use an environment variable for the file location so that the specific file to be downloaded can be customized using an environment variable defined on the `BuildConfig`, rather than updating the
ifndef::openshift-builds-v1[]
Dockerfile or
endif::[]
`assemble` script.

You can choose between different methods of defining environment variables:

* Using the `.s2i/environment` file] (only for a Source build strategy)
* Setting in `BuildConfig`
* Providing explicitly using `oc start-build --env` (only for builds that are triggered manually)

//used by a Source build, see Overriding builder image scripts.
