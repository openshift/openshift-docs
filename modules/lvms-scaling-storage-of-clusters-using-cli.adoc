= Scaling up the storage of clusters by using the CLI

You can scale up the storage capacity of the worker nodes on a cluster by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Prerequisites

* You have additional unused devices on each cluster to be used by {lvms-first}.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have created an `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR).

.Procedure

. Edit the `LVMCluster` CR by running the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc edit <lvmcluster_file_name> -n <namespace>
----

. Add the path to the new device in the `deviceSelector` field.

. Save the `LVMCluster` CR.
