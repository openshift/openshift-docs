= About {PM-shortname}

You can use {PM-title} to monitor the power usage and identify power-consuming containers running in an {product-title} cluster. {PM-shortname-c} collects and exports energy-related system statistics from various components, such as CPU and DRAM. It provides estimates and granular power consumption data for Kubernetes pods and namespaces, and reads the power consumption of nodes.

[WARNING]
====
{PM-shortname-c} Technology Preview works only in bare-metal deployments. Most public cloud vendors do not expose Kernel Power Management Subsystems to virtual machines.
