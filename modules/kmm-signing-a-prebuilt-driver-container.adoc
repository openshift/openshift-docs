[id="kmm-signing-a-prebuilt-driver-container_{context}"]
= Signing a pre-built driver container

Use this procedure if you have a pre-built image, such as an image either distributed by a hardware vendor or built elsewhere.

The following YAML file adds the public/private key-pair as secrets with the required key names - `key` for the private key, `cert` for the public key. The cluster then pulls down the `unsignedImage` image, opens it, signs the kernel modules listed in `filesToSign`, adds them back, and pushes the resulting image as `containerImage`.


Kernel Module Management (KMM) should then deploy the DaemonSet that loads the signed kmods onto all the nodes that match the selector. The driver containers should run successfully on any nodes that have the public key in their MOK database, and any nodes that are not secure-boot enabled, which ignore the signature. They should fail to load on any that have secure-boot enabled but do not have that key in their MOK database.

.Prerequisites

* The `keySecret` and `certSecret` secrets have been created.

.Procedure

. Apply the YAML file:
