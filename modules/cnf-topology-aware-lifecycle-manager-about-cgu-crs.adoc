[id="talo-about-cgu-crs_{context}"]
= About the ClusterGroupUpgrade CR

The {cgu-operator-first} builds the remediation plan from the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR for a group of clusters. You can define the following specifications in a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR:

* Clusters in the group
* Blocking `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CRs
* Applicable list of managed policies
* Number of concurrent updates
* Applicable canary updates
* Actions to perform before and after the update
* Update timing

You can control the start time of an update using the `enable` field in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR.
For example, if you have a scheduled maintenance window of four hours, you can prepare a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR with the `enable` field set to `false`.

You can set the timeout by configuring the `spec.remediationStrategy.timeout` setting as follows:
[source,yaml]
----
spec
  remediationStrategy:
          maxConcurrency: 1
          timeout: 240
----

You can use the `batchTimeoutAction` to determine what happens if an update fails for a cluster.
You can specify `continue` to skip the failing cluster and continue to upgrade other clusters, or `abort` to stop policy remediation for all clusters.
Once the timeout elapses, {cgu-operator} removes all `enforce` policies to ensure that no further updates are made to clusters.

To apply the changes, you set the `enabled` field to `true`.

For more information see the "Applying update policies to managed clusters" section.

As {cgu-operator} works through remediation of the policies to the specified clusters, the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR can report true or false statuses for a number of conditions.

[NOTE]
====
After {cgu-operator} completes a cluster update, the cluster does not update again under the control of the same `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR. You must create a new `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR in the following cases:

* When you need to update the cluster again
* When the cluster changes to non-compliant with the `inform` policy after being updated
====

[id="selecting_clusters_{context}"]
== Selecting clusters

{cgu-operator} builds a remediation plan and selects clusters based on the following fields:

* The `clusterLabelSelector` field specifies the labels of the clusters that you want to update. This consists of a list of the standard label selectors from `k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1`. Each selector in the list uses either label value pairs or label expressions. Matches from each selector are added to the final list of clusters along with the matches from the `clusterSelector` field and the `cluster` field.
* The `clusters` field specifies a list of clusters to update.
* The `canaries` field specifies the clusters for canary updates.
* The `maxConcurrency` field specifies the number of clusters to update in a batch.
* The `actions` field specifies `beforeEnable` actions that {cgu-operator} takes as it begins the update process, and `afterCompletion` actions that {cgu-operator} takes as it completes policy remediation for each cluster.

You can use the `clusters`, `clusterLabelSelector`, and `clusterSelector` fields together to create a combined list of clusters.

The remediation plan starts with the clusters listed in the `canaries` field. Each canary cluster forms a single-cluster batch.

[NOTE]

Any failures during the update of a canary cluster stops the update process.
====

When the remediation plan is successfully created, you can you set the `enable` field to `true` and {cgu-operator} starts to update the non-compliant clusters with the specified managed policies.

[NOTE]
====
You can only make changes to the `spec` fields if the `enable` field of the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR is set to `false`.
====

[id="validating_{context}"]
== Validating

{cgu-operator} checks that all specified managed policies are available and correct, and uses the `Validated` condition to report the status and reasons as follows:

* `true`
+
Validation is completed.
* `false`
+
Policies are missing or invalid, or an invalid platform image has been specified.

[id="precaching_{context}"]
== Pre-caching

Clusters might have limited bandwidth to access the container image registry, which can cause a timeout before the updates are completed. On {sno} clusters, you can use pre-caching to avoid this. The container image pre-caching starts when you create a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR with the `preCaching` field set to `true`.
{cgu-operator} compares the available disk space with the estimated {product-title} image size to ensure that there is enough space. If a cluster has insufficient space, {cgu-operator} cancels pre-caching for that cluster and does not remediate policies on it.

{cgu-operator} uses the `PrecacheSpecValid` condition to report status information as follows:

* `true`
+
The pre-caching spec is valid and consistent.
* `false`
+
The pre-caching spec is incomplete.

{cgu-operator} uses the `PrecachingSucceeded` condition to report status information as follows:

* `true`
+
TALM has concluded the pre-caching process. If pre-caching fails for any cluster, the update fails for that cluster but proceeds for all other clusters. A message informs you if pre-caching has failed for any clusters.
* `false`
+
Pre-caching is still in progress for one or more clusters or has failed for all clusters.

For more information see the "Using the container image pre-cache feature" section.

[id="creating_backup_{context}"]
== Creating a backup

For {sno}, {cgu-operator} can create a backup of a deployment before an update. If the update fails, you can recover the previous version and restore a cluster to a working state without requiring a reprovision of applications. To use the backup feature you first create a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR with the `backup` field set to `true`. To ensure that the contents of the backup are up to date, the backup is not taken until you set the `enable` field in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR to `true`.

{cgu-operator} uses the `BackupSucceeded` condition to report the status and reasons as follows:

* `true`
+
Backup is completed for all clusters or the backup run has completed but failed for one or more clusters. If backup fails for any cluster, the update fails for that cluster but proceeds for all other clusters.
* `false`
+
Backup is still in progress for one or more clusters or has failed for all clusters.

For more information, see the "Creating a backup of cluster resources before upgrade" section.

[id="updating_clusters_{context}"]
== Updating clusters
{cgu-operator} enforces the policies following the remediation plan.
Enforcing the policies for subsequent batches starts immediately after all the clusters of the current batch are compliant with all the managed policies. If the batch times out, {cgu-operator} moves on to the next batch. The timeout value of a batch is the `spec.timeout` field divided by the number of batches in the remediation plan.

{cgu-operator} uses the `Progressing` condition to report the status and reasons as follows:

* `true`
+
{cgu-operator} is remediating non-compliant policies.
* `false`
+
The update is not in progress. Possible reasons for this are:
+
** All clusters are compliant with all the managed policies.
** The update has timed out as policy remediation took too long.
** Blocking CRs are missing from the system or have not yet completed.
** The `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR is not enabled.
** Backup is still in progress.

[NOTE]
====
The managed policies apply in the order that they are listed in the `managedPolicies` field in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR. One managed policy is applied to the specified clusters at a time. When a cluster complies with the current policy, the next managed policy is applied to it.

== Update status

{cgu-operator} uses the `Succeeded` condition to report the status and reasons as follows:

* `true`
+
All clusters are compliant with the specified managed policies.
* `false`
+
Policy remediation failed as there were no clusters available for remediation, or because policy remediation took too long for one of the following reasons:
+
** The current batch contains canary updates and the cluster in the batch does not comply with all the managed policies within the batch timeout.
** Clusters did not comply with the managed policies within the `timeout` value specified in the `remediationStrategy` field.
