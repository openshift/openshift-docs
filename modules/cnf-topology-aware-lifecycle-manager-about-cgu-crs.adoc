= About the ClusterGroupUpgrade CR

The {cgu-operator-first} builds the remediation plan from the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR for a group of clusters. You can define the following specifications in a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR:

* Clusters in the group
* Blocking `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CRs
* Applicable list of managed policies
* Number of concurrent updates
* Applicable canary updates
* Actions to perform before and after the update
* Update timing

As {cgu-operator} works through remediation of the policies to the specified clusters, the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR can have the following states:

* `UpgradeNotStarted`
* `UpgradeCannotStart`
* `UpgradeNotComplete`
* `UpgradeTimedOut`
* `UpgradeCompleted`
* `PrecachingRequired`

[NOTE]
====
After {cgu-operator} completes a cluster update, the cluster does not update again under the control of the same `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR. You must create a new `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR in the following cases:

* When you need to update the cluster again
* When the cluster changes to non-compliant with the `inform` policy after being updated
====

[id="upgrade_not_started"]
== The UpgradeNotStarted state

The initial state of the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR is `UpgradeNotStarted`.

{cgu-operator} builds a remediation plan based on the following fields:

* The `clusterSelector` field specifies the labels of the clusters that you want to update.
* The `clusters` field specifies a list of clusters to update.
* The `canaries` field specifies the clusters for canary updates.
* The `maxConcurrency` field specifies the number of clusters to update in a batch.

You can use the `clusters` and the `clusterSelector` fields together to create a combined list of clusters.

The remediation plan starts with the clusters listed in the `canaries` field. Each canary cluster forms a single-cluster batch.

[NOTE]
====
Any failures during the update of a canary cluster stops the update process.
====

The `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR transitions to the `UpgradeNotCompleted` state after the remediation plan is successfully created and after the `enable` field is set to `true`. At this point, {cgu-operator} starts to update the non-compliant clusters with the specified managed policies.

[NOTE]
====
You can only make changes to the `spec` fields if the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR is either in the `UpgradeNotStarted` or the `UpgradeCannotStart` state.

----
<1> Defines the list of clusters to update.
<2> Lists the user-defined set of policies to remediate.
<3> Defines the specifics of the cluster updates.
<4> Defines the clusters for canary updates.
<5> Defines the maximum number of concurrent updates in a batch. The number of remediation batches is the number of canary clusters, plus the number of clusters, except the canary clusters, divided by the `maxConcurrency` value. The clusters that are already compliant with all the managed policies are excluded from the remediation plan.
<6> Displays information about the status of the updates.

[id="upgrade_cannot_start"]
== The UpgradeCannotStart state

In the `UpgradeCannotStart` state, the update cannot start because of the following reasons:

* Blocking CRs are missing from the system
* Blocking CRs have not yet finished

[id="upgrade_not_completed"]
== The UpgradeNotCompleted state

In the `UpgradeNotCompleted` state, {cgu-operator} enforces the policies following the remediation plan defined in the `UpgradeNotStarted` state.

Enforcing the policies for subsequent batches starts immediately after all the clusters of the current batch are compliant with all the managed policies. If the batch times out, {cgu-operator} moves on to the next batch. The timeout value of a batch  is the `spec.timeout` field divided by the number of batches in the remediation plan.

[NOTE]
====
The managed policies apply in the order that they are listed in the `managedPolicies` field in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR. One managed policy is applied to the specified clusters at a time. After the specified clusters comply with the current policy, the next managed policy is applied to the next non-compliant cluster.

<2> The `status` fields change accordingly when the update begins.
<3> Lists the clusters in the batch and the index of the policy that is being currently applied to each cluster. The index of the policies starts with `0` and the index follows the order of the `status.managedPoliciesForUpgrade` list.

[id="upgrade_timed_out"]
== The UpgradeTimedOut state

In the `UpgradeTimedOut` state, {cgu-operator} checks every hour if all the policies for the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR are compliant. The checks continue until the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR is deleted or the updates are completed.
The periodic checks allow the updates to complete if they get prolonged due to network, CPU, or other issues. 

{cgu-operator} transitions to the `UpgradeTimedOut` state in two cases:

* When the current batch contains canary updates and the cluster in the batch does not comply with all the managed policies within the batch timeout.
* When the clusters do not comply with the managed policies within the `timeout` value specified in the `remediationStrategy` field.

If the policies are compliant, {cgu-operator} transitions to the `UpgradeCompleted` state.

[id="upgrade_completed"]
== The UpgradeCompleted state

In the `UpgradeCompleted` state, the cluster updates are complete.

<3> Displays that all the policies are applied to the cluster.

[id="precaching-required"]
[discreet]
== The PrecachingRequired state

In the `PrecachingRequired` state, the clusters need to have images pre-cached before the update can start. For more information about pre-caching, see the "Using the container image pre-cache feature" section.
