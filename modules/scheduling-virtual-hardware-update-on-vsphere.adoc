= Scheduling an update for virtual hardware on vSphere

Virtual hardware updates can be scheduled to occur when a virtual machine is powered on or rebooted. You can schedule your virtual hardware updates exclusively in vCenter by following link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc/GUID-96C06236-C271-4CFE-857E-22D1FDEECC95.html[Schedule a Compatibility Upgrade for a Virtual Machine] in the VMware documentation.

When scheduling an update prior to performing an update of {product-title}, the virtual hardware update occurs when the nodes are rebooted during the course of the {product-title} update.
