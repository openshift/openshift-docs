= Encryption protocol and IPsec mode

The encrypt cipher used is `AES-GCM-16-256`. The integrity check value (ICV) is `16` bytes. The key length is `256` bits.

The IPsec mode used is _Transport mode_, a mode that encrypts end-to-end communication by adding an Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP) header to the IP header of the original packet and encrypts the packet data. {product-title} does not currently use or support IPsec _Tunnel mode_ for pod-to-pod communication.
