//NoLeadingVirtOperator Alert
[id="NoLeadingVirtOperator_{context}"]
== NoLeadingVirtOperator alert

.Description

In the past 10 minutes, no virt-operator pod holds the leader lease, despite one or more virt-operator pods being in `Ready` state. The alert suggests no operating virt-operator pod exists.

.Reason

The virt-operator is the first Kubernetes Operator active in a {product-title} cluster. Its primary responsibilities are:

* Installation
* Live-update
* Live-upgrade of a cluster
* Monitoring the lifecycle of top-level controllers such as virt-controller, virt-handler, and virt-launcher
* Managing the reconciliation of top-level controllers

In addition, the virt-operator is responsible for cluster-wide tasks such as certificate rotation and some infrastructure management.

The virt-operator deployment has a default replica of two pods with one leader pod holding a leader lease, indicating an operating virt-operator pod.

This alert indicates a failure at the cluster level. Critical cluster-wide management functionalities such as certification rotation, upgrade, and reconciliation of controllers may be temporarily unavailable.

.Troubleshoot

Determine a virt-operator pod's leader status from the pod logs. The log messages containing `Started leading` and `acquire leader` indicate the leader status of a given virt-operator pod.

Additionally, always check if there are any running virt-operator pods and the pods' statuses with these commands:

.Resolution

There are several reasons for no virt-operator pod holding the leader lease, despite one or more virt-operator pods being in `Ready` state. Identify the root cause and take appropriate action.

Otherwise, open a support issue and provide the information gathered in the troubleshooting process.

//NoReadyVirtController Alert
[id="NoReadyVirtController_{context}"]
== NoReadyVirtController alert

.Description

The virt-controller monitors virtual machine instances (VMIs). The virt-controller also manages the associated pods by creating and managing the lifecycle of the pods associated with the VMI objects.

A VMI object always associates with a pod during its lifetime. However, the pod instance can change over time because of VMI migration.

This alert occurs when detection of no ready virt-controllers occurs for five minutes.

.Reason

If the virt-controller fails, then VM lifecycle management completely fails. Lifecycle management tasks include launching a new VMI or shutting down an existing VMI.

.Troubleshoot

. Check the vdeployment status of the virt-controller for available replicas and conditions.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n $NAMESPACE get deployment virt-controller -o yaml
----

. Check if the virt-controller pods exist and check their statuses.
+
[source,terminal]

----

. Check the virt-controller pods' events.

----

. Check the virt-controller pods' logs.

----

. Check if there are issues with the nodes, such as if the nodes are in a `NotReady` state.

.Resolution

There are several reasons for no virt-controller pods being in a `Ready` state. Identify the root cause and take appropriate action.

Otherwise, open a support issue and provide the information gathered in the troubleshooting process.

//VirtApiRESTErrorsBurst Alert
[id="VirtApiRESTErrorsBurst_{context}"]
== VirtApiRESTErrorsBurst alert

.Description

More than 80% of the REST calls fail in virt-api in the last five minutes.

.Reason

A very high rate of failed REST calls to virt-api causes slow response, slow execution of API calls, or even complete dismissal of API calls.

.Troubleshoot

. Modify the environment variable `NAMESPACE`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export NAMESPACE="$(oc get kubevirt -A -o custom-columns="":.metadata.namespace)"
----

. Check to see how many running virt-api pods exist.

$ oc -n $NAMESPACE get pods -l kubevirt.io=virt-api
----

. View the pods' logs using `oc logs` and the pods' statuses using `oc describe`.

.Resolution

There are several reasons for a high rate of failed REST calls. Identify the root cause and take appropriate action.

* Node resource exhaustion
* Not enough memory on the cluster
* Nodes are down
* The API server overloads, such as when the scheduler is not 100% available)
* Networking issues

Otherwise, open a support issue and provide the information gathered in the troubleshooting process.

----

An example of a virt-controller pod name in the logs is `virt-controller-7888c64d66-dzc9p`. However, there may be several pods that run virt-controller.

.Resolution

There are several known reasons why the detection of no running virt-controller occurs. Identify the root cause from the list of possible reasons and take appropriate action.

* Node resource exhaustion
* Not enough memory on the cluster
* Nodes are down
* The API server overloads, such as when the scheduler is not 100% available)
* Networking issues

Otherwise, open a support issue and provide the information gathered in the troubleshooting process.

//VirtControllerRESTErrorsBurst Alert
[id="VirtControllerRESTErrorsBurst_{context}"]
== VirtControllerRESTErrorsBurst alert

.Description

More than 80% of the REST calls failed in virt-controller in the last five minutes.

.Reason

Virt-controller has potentially fully lost connectivity to the API server. This loss does not affect running workloads, but propagation of status updates and actions like migrations cannot occur.

.Troubleshoot

There are two common error types associated with virt-controller REST call failure:

* The API server overloads, causing timeouts. Check the API server metrics and details like response times and overall calls.

* The virt-controller pod cannot reach the API server. Common causes are:
** DNS issues on the node
** Networking connectivity issues

.Resolution

Check the virt-controller logs to determine if the virt-controller pod cannot connect to the API server at all. If so, delete the pod to force a restart.

Additionally, verify if node resource exhaustion or not having enough memory on the cluster is causing the connection failure.

The issue normally relates to DNS or CNI issues outside of the scope of this alert.

Otherwise, open a support issue and provide the information gathered in the troubleshooting process.

//VirtHandlerRESTErrorsBurst Alert
[id="VirtHandlerRESTErrorsBurst_{context}"]
== VirtHandlerRESTErrorsBurst alert

.Description

More than 80% of the REST calls failed in virt-handler in the last five minutes.

.Reason

Virt-handler lost the connection to the API server. Running workloads on the affected node still run, but status updates cannot propagate and actions such as migrations cannot occur.

.Troubleshoot

There are two common error types associated with virt-operator REST call failure:

* The API server overloads, causing timeouts. Check the API server metrics and details like response times and overall calls.

* The virt-operator pod cannot reach the API server. Common causes are:
** DNS issues on the node
** Networking connectivity issues

.Resolution

If the virt-handler cannot connect to the API server, delete the pod to force a restart. The issue normally relates to DNS or CNI issues outside of the scope of this alert. Identify the root cause and take appropriate action.

Otherwise, open a support issue and provide the information gathered in the troubleshooting process.
