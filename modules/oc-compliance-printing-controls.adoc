Compliance standards are generally organized into a hierarchy as follows:

* A benchmark is the top-level definition of a set of controls for a particular standard. For example, FedRAMP Moderate or Center for Internet Security (CIS) v.1.6.0.
* A control describes a family of requirements that must be met in order to be in compliance with the benchmark. For example, FedRAMP AC-01 (access control policy and procedures).
* A rule is a single check that is specific for the system being brought into compliance, and one or more of these rules map to a control.
* The Compliance Operator handles the grouping of rules into a profile for a single benchmark. It can be difficult to determine which controls that the set of rules in a profile satisfy.

.Procedure

* The `oc compliance` `controls` subcommand provides a report of the standards and controls that a given profile satisfies:
