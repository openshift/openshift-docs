== Feature gates now available for developers

As an application developer, you now can experiment with upcoming Kubernetes features to evaluate their potential benefits for specific use cases. Enable feature gates to test new functions for current or future deployments. With this release, you can experiment with capabilities such as advanced CPU management, enhanced scheduling features, or experimental storage options. For more information, see the following link:

* xref:../microshift_configuring/microshift-feature-gates.adoc#microshift-feature-gates[Using feature gates to develop solutions]

[id="microshift-4-21-SR-IOV_{context}"]
== SR-IOV Network Operator

You can now use the SR-IOV Network Operator to configure and access high-performance networking interfaces. The SR-IOV Network Operator exposes SR-IOV devices as resources and uses NetworkAttachment Definitions (NADs) to access Virtual Functions (VFs). As a result, you do not need to manually configure SR-IOV through the operating system. You can treat Virtual Functions as resources that can be reliably mapped to your containerized applications. These resources reduce manual error and ensure consistent, low-latency networking for critical applications.
