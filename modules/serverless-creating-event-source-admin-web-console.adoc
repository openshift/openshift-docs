A Knative _event source_ can be any Kubernetes object that generates or imports cloud events, and relays those events to another endpoint, known as a _sink_.

* You have logged in to the web console and are in the *Administrator* perspective.

* You have cluster administrator permissions on {ocp-product-title}, or you have cluster or dedicated administrator permissions on {rosa-product-title} or {dedicated-product-title}.

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective of the {ocp-product-title} web console, navigate to *Serverless* -> *Eventing*.
. In the *Create* list, select *Event Source*. You will be directed to the *Event Sources* page.
