* You have `cluster-admin` privileges on {ocp-product-title}, or you have cluster or dedicated administrator permissions on {rosa-product-title} or {dedicated-product-title}.

.Procedure

. In the {ocp-product-title} web console, navigate to *Serverless* -> *Eventing*.
. In the *Create* list, select *Event Source*. You will be directed to the *Event Sources* page.
