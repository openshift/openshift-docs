= Cluster interaction overview

A large language model (LLM) is used with the {ols-long} service to generate responses to questions. Use the cluster interaction feature to enhance the knowledge available to the LLM with information about an {ocp-product-title} cluster. Providing cluster information, such as the namespaces or pods that the cluster contains, enables the LLM to generate highly customized responses for your environment.

Function calling, also known as tool calling, is a capability that enables an LLM to interact with external APIs. {ols-long} uses the `auto` setting for the tool choice parameter of the LLM to make API calls to the LLM provider. To activate the cluster interaction feature in the {ols-long} service, tool calling must be enabled in the LLM provider.

[NOTE]
====
Enabling tool calling can dramatically increase token usage. When you use public model providers, increased token usage can result in greater billing costs.
