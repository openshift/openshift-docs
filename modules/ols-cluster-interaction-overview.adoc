= Cluster interaction overview

A large language model (LLM) is used with the {ols-long} service to generate responses to questions. Use the cluster interaction feature to enhance the knowledge available to the LLM with information about an {ocp-product-title} cluster. Providing cluster information, such as the namespaces or pods that the cluster contains, enables the LLM to generate highly customized responses for your environment.
