= Configuring cert-manager for the external-secrets certificate requirements

Certificate management for the `external-secrets` webhook and plugins can be assigned to `cert-manager`. This configuration is optional.

When `cert-manager` is not used, `external-secrets` defaults to its own certificate management. In this mode, it automatically generates the required certificates for the webhook, while you are responsible for manually configuring certificates for the plugins.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have created the `ExternalSecretsConfig` custom resource.
* You have installed the `cert-manager`. {cert-manager-operator} can be used. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html-single/security_and_compliance/index#cert-manager-operator-install[Installing the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift]

.Procedure

. Edit the `ExternalSecretsConfig` custom resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$  oc edit externalsecretsconfigs.operator.openshift.io cluster
----

. Configure 'cert-manager' by editing the `spec.controllerConfig.certProvider.certManager` section as follows:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ExternalSecretsConfig
...
spec:
  controllerConfig:
    certProvider:
      certManager:
        injectAnnotations: "true" <1>
        issuerRef:
          name: <issuer_name> <2>
          kind: <issuer_kind> <3>
          group: <issuer_group> <4>
        mode: Enabled <5>
----
+
<1> Must be set to `true` when enabled.
<2> Name of the issuer object referenced in `ExternalSecretsConfig`.
<3> API issuer. Can be set to either `Issuer` or `ClusterIssuer`.
<4> API issuer group. The group name must be `cert-manager.io`.
<5> Must be set to `Enabled`. This is an immutable filed and cannot be modified once it is configured.

. Save your changes.

[NOTE]
====
After you update the `cert-manager` configurations in the `externalsecretsconfig.operator.openshift.io` object, you must manually delete `external-secrets-cert-controller` deployment by running the following command. This prevents performance degradation of the `external-secrets` application.

[source,terminal]
----
$  oc delete deployments.apps external-secrets-cert-controller -n external-secrets
----

Optionally, you can delete other resources created for the `cert-controller` by running the following commands:

[source,terminal]
----
$  oc delete clusterrolebindings.rbac.authorization.k8s.io external-secrets-cert-controller
----

[source,terminal]
----
$  oc delete clusterroles.rbac.authorization.k8s.io external-secrets-cert-controller
----

[source,terminal]
----
$  oc delete serviceaccounts external-secrets-cert-controller -n external-secrets
----

[source,terminal]
----
$  oc delete secrets external-secrets-webhook -n external-secrets
----
