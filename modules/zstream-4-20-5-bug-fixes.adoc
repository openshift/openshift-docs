The following bugs are fixed for this release:

* Before this update, the `oauth` pods in the `openshift-authentication` namespaces could get stuck while rolling out changes when one of the corresponding nodes these pods are running on is not ready or not available. This was causing authentication to completely stop until the blocked rollout concludes. With this release, the pods can proceed with the rolling update even when an unhealthy node is down or unavailable (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-61896[OCPBUGS-61896])

* Before this update, alerts in the project overview were not visible because the application was querying an incorrect API. With this release, the application now queries the correct API and displays the project alerts. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-63125[OCPBUGS-63125])

* Before this update, the aggregated API servers on {product-title} were provisioned with `in-memory` loopback certificates that were valid for only 1 year. With this release, the aggregated API servers on {product-title} are provisioned with `in-memory` loopback certificates that are valid for 3 years. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-63532[OCPBUGS-63532])

* Before this update, when directly navigating to a page created by a web console dynamic plugin, the web console might redirect to a different URL. With this release, the URL redirect has been removed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-63616[OCPBUGS-63616])

* Before this release, any unrelated changes to a `netpol` resource triggered a full reconcile of the object, including deleting and re-adding rules. With this release, a `netpol` object fully reconciles when required. Otherwise, it is skipped. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-64590[OCPBUGS-64590])

* Before this update, the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) form incorrectly mandated both CPU and memory values, forcing users to use YAML for single-metric HPAs (such as memory-only) or to rely on the default CPU setting. With this release, the form has been updated and leaving a field empty now correctly omits that metric, allowing users to create CPU-only, memory-only, or default 80% CPU HPAs from the web form. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-64639[OCPBUGS-64639])

* Before this update, it was impossible to schedule a `must-gather` pod to a specific worker node when the `--node-name` argument was used as the pod's node affinity accepted only control plane nodes. With this release, the `must-gather` logic is updated to avoid setting node affinity when the `--node-name` argument is set. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-65523[OCPBUGS-65523])
