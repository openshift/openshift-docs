= Dependencies file

The dependencies of an Operator are listed in a `dependencies.yaml` file in the
`metadata/` folder of a bundle. This file is optional and currently only used to
specify explicit Operator-version dependencies.

The dependency list contains a `type` field for each item to specify what kind
of dependency this is. There are two supported types of Operator dependencies:

* `olm.package`: A package type means this is a dependency for a specific Operator version. The
dependency information must include the package name and the version of the
package in semver format. For example, you can specify an exact version such as
`0.5.2` or a range of versions such as `>0.5.1`.
* `olm.gvk`: With a GVK type, the author can specify a dependency with GVK
information, similar to existing CRD and API-based usage in a CSV. This is a
path to enable Operator authors to consolidate all dependencies, API or explicit
versions, to be in the same place.

In the following example, dependencies are specified for a Prometheus Operator
and etcd CRDs:
