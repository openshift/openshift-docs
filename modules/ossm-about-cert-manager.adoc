= About the cert-manager Operator istio-csr agent

include::snippets/technology-preview-istiocsr.adoc[]

The {cert-manager-operator} enhances certificate management for securing workloads and control plane components in {SMProductName} and {istio}. It supports issuing, delivering, and renewing certificates used for mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) through cert-manager issuers.

By integrating {istio} with the `istio-csr` agent that is managed by the cert-manager Operator, you enable {istio} to request and manage the certificates directly. The integration simplifies security configuration and centralizes certificate management within the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
The {cert-manager-operator} must be installed before you create and install your `{istio}` resource.
