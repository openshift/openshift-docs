= About integrating Service Mesh with cert-manager and istio-csr
//TP1 content influx. Title, etc may change.

The cert-manager tool provides integration with Istio through an external agent called `istio-csr`. The `istio-csr` agent handles certificate signing requests (CSR) from Istio proxies and the `controlplane` in the following ways:

. Verifying the identity of the workload.
. Creating a CSR through cert-manager for the workload.

The cert-manager tool then creates a CSR to the configured CA Issuer, which signs the certificate.

[NOTE]
====
Red{nbsp}Hat provides support for integrating with `istio-csr` and cert-manager. Red{nbsp}Hat does not provide direct support for the `istio-csr` or the community cert-manager components. The use of community cert-manager shown here is for demonstration purposes only.
====

//For Istio users, cert-manager also provides integration with `istio-csr`, which is a certificate authority (CA) server that handles certificate signing requests (CSR) from Istio proxies. The server then delegates signing to cert-manager, which forwards CSRs to the configured CA server.

.Prerequisites
* One of these versions of cert-manager:
** Red Hat cert-manager Operator 1.10 or later
** community cert-manager Operator 1.11 or later
** cert-manager 1.11 or later
* {SMProductName} 3.0 or later
* An `IstioCNI` instance is running in the cluster
* Istio CLI (`istioctl`) tool is installed
* `jq` is installed
* Helm is installed

//Note to add {cert-manager-operator} to stand alone common attributes file. That is outside the scope of this PR and there is an existing Jira to add common attributes for OSSM GA.
