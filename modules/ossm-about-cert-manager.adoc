= About integrating Service Mesh with cert-manager and istio-csr
//TP1 content influx. Title, etc may change.

The cert-manager tool provides integration with Istio through an external agent called `istio-csr`. The `istio-csr` agent handles certificate signing requests (CSR) from Istio proxies and the `controlplane` by performing the following:

. Verifying the identity of the workload.
. Creating a CSR through `cert-manager` for the workload.

The cert-manager tool then creates a CSR to the configured CA Issuer which signs the certificate.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat provides support for integrating with `istio-csr` and `cert-manager`. Red Hat does not provide direct support for the `istio-csr` or the community `cert-manager` components. The use of community cert-manager shown here is for demonstration purposes only.
====

//For Istio users, cert-manager also provides integration with `istio-csr`, which is a certificate authority (CA) server that handles certificate signing requests (CSR) from Istio proxies. The server then delegates signing to cert-manager, which forwards CSRs to the configured CA server.
