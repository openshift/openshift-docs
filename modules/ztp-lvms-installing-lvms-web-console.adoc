.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console, navigate to *Ecosystem* -> *Software Catalog*.
. Search for the *{lvms}* from the list of available Operators, and then click *Install*.
. Keep the default selection of *Installation mode* (*"All namespaces on the cluster (default)"*) and *Installed Namespace* (*"openshift-operators"*) to ensure that the Operator is installed properly.
. Click *Install*.

.Verification
