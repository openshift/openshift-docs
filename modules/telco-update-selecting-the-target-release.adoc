= Selecting the target release

Use the link:https://access.redhat.com/labs/ocpupgradegraph/update_path[Red Hat {product-title} Update Graph] or the
link:https://github.com/openshift/cincinnati-graph-data/tree/master/channels[cincinnati-graph-data repository] to determine what release to update to.

[id="telco-update-determining-available-z-streams_{context}"]
== Determining what z-stream updates are available

Before you can update to a new z-stream release, you need to know what versions are available.

[NOTE]
====
You do not need to change the channel when performing a z-stream update.
====

.Procedure
. Determine which z-stream releases are available.
Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Cluster version is 4.14.34

Upstream is unset, so the cluster will use an appropriate default.
Channel: stable-4.14 (available channels: candidate-4.14, candidate-4.15, eus-4.14, eus-4.16, fast-4.14, fast-4.15, stable-4.14, stable-4.15)

Recommended updates:

[id="telco-update-changing-channel-eus-to-eus_{context}"]
== Changing the channel for a Control Plane Only update

You must change the channel to the required version for a Control Plane Only update.

[NOTE]
====
You do not need to change the channel when performing a z-stream update.
====

.Procedure
. Determine the currently configured update channel:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusterversion -o=jsonpath='{.items[*].spec}' | jq
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
{
  "channel": "stable-4.14",
  "clusterID": "01eb9a57-2bfb-4f50-9d37-dc04bd5bac75"
}
----

. Change the channel to point to the new channel you want to update to:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade channel eus-4.16
----

. Confirm the updated channel:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusterversion -o=jsonpath='{.items[*].spec}' | jq
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
{
  "channel": "eus-4.16",
  "clusterID": "01eb9a57-2bfb-4f50-9d37-dc04bd5bac75"
}

[id="telco-update-changing-channel-early-eus-to-eus_{context}"]
=== Changing the channel for an early EUS to EUS update

The update path to a brand new release of {product-title} is not available in either the EUS channel or the stable channel until 45 to 90 days after the initial GA of a minor release.

To begin testing an update to a new release, you can use the fast channel.

.Procedure
. Change the channel to `fast-<y+1>`.
For example, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade channel fast-4.16
----

. Check the update path from the new channel.
Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade
----
+
[source,terminal]

Cluster version is 4.15.33

  Reason: AdminAckRequired
  Message: Kubernetes 1.28 and therefore OpenShift 4.16 remove several APIs which require admin consideration. Please see the knowledge article https://access.redhat.com/articles/6958394 for details and instructions.

Upstream is unset, so the cluster will use an appropriate default.
Channel: fast-4.16 (available channels: candidate-4.15, candidate-4.16, eus-4.15, eus-4.16, fast-4.15, fast-4.16, stable-4.15, stable-4.16)

. Follow the update procedure to get to version 4.16 (<y+1> from version 4.15)
+
[NOTE]
====
You can keep your worker nodes paused between EUS releases even if you are using the fast channel.
====

. When you get to the required <y+1> release, change the channel again, this time to `fast-<y+2>`.

. Follow the EUS update procedure to get to the required <y+2> release.

[id="telco-update-updating-y-stream_{context}"]
== Changing the channel for a y-stream update

In a y-stream update you change the channel to the next release channel.

[NOTE]
====
Use the stable or EUS release channels for production clusters.

.Procedure
. Change the update channel:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade channel stable-4.15
----

. Check the update path from the new channel.
Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade
