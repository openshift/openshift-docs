= Running the hub cluster factory install pipeline

Run the following steps to run the hub factory install pipeline.

.Prerequisites

* An installed {product-title} hub cluster.
* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Create a file `spokes.yaml` with sample details as shown. A sample configuration file is present in `examples/config.yaml`.
+
[NOTE]
====
At this stage you only need to build out the `config` section. The `config` section specifies the cluster configuration values used to install and configure the hub and edge cluster.

[source,yaml]
----
config:
  OC_OCP_VERSION: "4.10.9" <1>
  OC_ACM_VERSION: "2.4" <2>
  OC_OCS_VERSION: "4.9" <3>
----
+
<1> {product-title} version of the edge cluster.
<2> Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) version.
<3> The OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) version.

. Start the hub cluster pipeline from the command line:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ tkn pipeline start -n spoke-deployer spokes-config="$(cat /path-to-spoke.yaml/spokes.yaml)" -p kubeconfig=${KUBECONFIG} -w=ztp,claimName=ztp-pvc --timeout 5h --use-param-defaults deploy-ztp-hub
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This command starts the pipeline in the namespace `spoke-deployer` with the defined edge cluster configuration and the `kube` configuration in the workspace `ztp` with the previously configured persistent storage claim `ztp-pvc`. A timeout of 5 hours is set for the execution of the `deploy-ztp-hub` with all other parameters set to the default.

In order to track the PipelineRun progress run:
tkn pipelinerun logs deploy-ztp-hub-run-2h44k -f -n spoke-deployer
