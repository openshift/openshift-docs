= ComplianceRemediation object

For a specific check you can have a datastream specified fix. However, if a Kubernetes fix is available, then the Compliance Operator creates a `ComplianceRemediation` object.

.Example `ComplianceRemediation` object

<1> `true` indicates the remediation was applied. `false` indicates the remediation was not applied.
<2> Includes the definition of the remediation.
<3> Indicates remediation that was previously parsed from an earlier version of the content. The Compliance Operator still retains the outdated objects to give the administrator a chance to review the new remediations before applying them.

To get all the remediations from a suite, run the following command:
[source,terminal]
----
oc get complianceremediations \
-l compliance.openshift.io/suite=workers-compliancesuite
----

To list all failing checks that can be remediated automatically, run the following command:
[source,terminal]
----
oc get compliancecheckresults \
-l 'compliance.openshift.io/check-status in (FAIL),compliance.openshift.io/automated-remediation'
----

To list all failing checks that can be remediated manually, run the following command:
[source,terminal]
----
oc get compliancecheckresults \
-l 'compliance.openshift.io/check-status in (FAIL),!compliance.openshift.io/automated-remediation'
