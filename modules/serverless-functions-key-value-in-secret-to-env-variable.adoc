= Setting environment variable from a key value defined in a secret

. Open the `func.yaml` file for your function.

. For each value from a secret key-value pair that you want to assign to an environment variable, add the following YAML to the `envs` section:
+
[source,yaml]
----
name: test
namespace: ""
runtime: go
...
envs:
- name: EXAMPLE
  value: '{{ secret:mysecret:key }}'
----
+
* Substitute `EXAMPLE` with the name of the environment variable.
* Substitute `mysecret` with the name of the target secret.
* Substitute `key` with the key mapped to the target value.

. Save the configuration.
