= Running a compliance scan

[role="_abstract"]
Running a compliance scan checks the compliance status for your entire infrastructure across all compliance standards.
When you run a compliance scan, {product-title} takes a data snapshot of your environment.
The data snapshot includes alerts, images, network policies, deployments, and related host-based data.
Central collects the host-based data from the Sensors running in your clusters.
After that, Central collects more data from the compliance container running in each collector pod.
The compliance container collects the following data about your environment:

* Configurations for Docker Daemon, Docker image, and Docker container.
* Information about Docker networks.
* Command-line arguments and processes for Docker, Kubernetes, and {ocp}.
* Permissions of specific file paths.
* Configuration files for the core Kubernetes and {ocp} services.

After the data collection is complete, Central performs checks on the data to determine results.
You can view the results from the compliance dashboard and also generate compliance reports based on the results.

[NOTE]
====
In a compliance scan:

* *Control* describes a single line item in an industry or regulatory compliance standard against which an auditor evaluates an information system for compliance with said standard.
{product-title} checks the evidence of compliance with a single control by completing one or more checks.
* *Check* is the single test performed during a single control assessment.
* Some controls have multiple checks associated with them.
If any of the associated check fails for a control, the entire control state is marked as `Fail`.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the {product-title-short} portal and open the compliance dashboard by selecting *Compliance* from the navigation menu.
. Optional: By default, information under all standards is displayed in the compliance results. To view only information from specific standards, perform the following steps:
.. Click *Manage standards*.
.. By default, all standards are selected. Clear the checkbox for any specific standard that you do not want to display, and then click *Save*. Standards that are not selected do not appear in the dashboard display (including widgets), compliance results tables that are accessed from the dashboard, and PDF files created using the *Export* button. However, all default standards are included when results are exported as a CSV file.
. Click *Scan environment*.

[NOTE]
====
Scanning the entire environment takes about 2 minutes to complete.
This time might vary depending on the number of clusters and nodes in your environment.
