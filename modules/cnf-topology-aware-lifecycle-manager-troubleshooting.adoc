= Troubleshooting the {cgu-operator-full}

The {cgu-operator-first} is an {product-title} Operator that remediates {rh-rhacm} policies. When issues occur, use the `oc adm must-gather` command to gather details and logs and to take steps in debugging the issues.


For more information about related topics, see the following documentation:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6218901[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes 2.4 Support Matrix]

* The "Troubleshooting Operator issues" section

[id="talo-general-troubleshooting_{context}"]
== General troubleshooting

You can determine the cause of the problem by reviewing the following questions:

* Is the configuration that you are applying supported?
** Are the {rh-rhacm} and the {product-title} versions compatible?
** Are the {cgu-operator} and {rh-rhacm} versions compatible?
* Which of the following components is causing the problem?
** <<talo-troubleshooting-managed-policies_{context}>>
** <<talo-troubleshooting-clusters_{context}>>
** <<talo-troubleshooting-remediation-strategy_{context}>>
** <<talo-troubleshooting-remediation-talo_{context}>>

To ensure that the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` configuration is functional, you can do the following:

. Create the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR with the `spec.enable` field set to `false`.

. Wait for the status to be updated and go through the troubleshooting questions.

. If everything looks as expected, set the `spec.enable` field to `true` in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR.

[WARNING]
====
After you set the `spec.enable` field to `true` in the `ClusterUpgradeGroup` CR, the update procedure starts and you cannot edit the CR's `spec` fields anymore.
====

[id="talo-troubleshooting-modify-cgu_{context}"]
== Cannot modify the ClusterUpgradeGroup CR

Issue:: You cannot edit the `ClusterUpgradeGroup` CR after enabling the update.

Resolution:: Restart the procedure by performing the following steps:
+
. Remove the old `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete cgu -n <ClusterGroupUpgradeCR_namespace> <ClusterGroupUpgradeCR_name>
----
+
. Check and fix the existing issues with the managed clusters and policies.
.. Ensure that all the clusters are managed clusters and available.
.. Ensure that all the policies exist and have the `spec.remediationAction` field set to `inform`.
+
. Create a new `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR with the correct configurations.

=== Clusters are not compliant to some policies after a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR has completed

Issue:: The policy compliance status that {cgu-operator} uses to decide if remediation is needed has not yet fully updated for all clusters.
This may be because:
* The CGU was run too soon after a policy was created or updated.
* The remediation of a policy affects the compliance of subsequent policies in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR.

Resolution:: Create and apply a new `ClusterGroupUpdate` CR with the same specification.

[discrete]
[id="talo-troubleshooting-auto-create-policies_{context}"]
=== Auto-created `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR in the {ztp} workflow has no managed policies

Issue:: If there are no policies for the managed cluster when the cluster becomes `Ready`, a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR with no policies is auto-created.
Upon completion of the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR, the managed cluster is labeled as `ztp-done`.
If the `PolicyGenerator` or `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs were not pushed to the Git repository within the required time after `SiteConfig` resources were pushed, this might result in no policies being available for the target cluster when the cluster became `Ready`.

Resolution:: Verify that the policies you want to apply are available on the hub cluster, then create a `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR with the required policies.

You can either manually create the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR or trigger auto-creation again. To trigger auto-creation of the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR, remove the `ztp-done` label from the cluster and delete the empty `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR that was previously created in the `zip-install` namespace.

[discrete]
[id="talo-troubleshooting-pre-cache-failed_{context}"]
=== Pre-caching has failed

Issue:: Pre-caching might fail for one of the following reasons:
* There is not enough free space on the node.
* For a disconnected environment, the pre-cache image has not been properly mirrored.
* There was an issue when creating the pod.

Resolution::
. To check if pre-caching has failed due to insufficient space, check the log of the pre-caching pod in the node.
.. Find the name of the pod using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-talo-pre-cache
----
+
.. Check the logs to see if the error is related to insufficient space using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs -n openshift-talo-pre-cache <pod name>
----
+
. If there is no log, check the pod status using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe pod -n openshift-talo-pre-cache <pod name>
----
+
. If the pod does not exist, check the job status to see why it could not create a pod using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe job -n openshift-talo-pre-cache pre-cache
----
