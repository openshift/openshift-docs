= Configuring the audit log policy

You can configure the audit log policy to use when logging requests that come to the API servers.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Edit the `APIServer` resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit apiserver cluster
----

. Update the `spec.audit.profile` field:
+
[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
  kind: APIServer
  metadata:
  ...
  spec:
    audit:
      profile: WriteRequestBodies <1>
----
<1> Set to `Default`, `WriteRequestBodies`, or `AllRequestBodies`. The default profile is `Default`.

. Save the file to apply the changes.

. Verify that a new revision of the Kubernetes API server pods has rolled out. This will take several minutes.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get kubeapiserver -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="NodeInstallerProgressing")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'
----
+
Review the `NodeInstallerProgressing` status condition for the Kubernetes API server to verify that all nodes are at the latest revision. The output shows `AllNodesAtLatestRevision` upon successful update:
+
[source,terminal]
----
AllNodesAtLatestRevision
3 nodes are at revision 12
----
+
If the output shows a message similar to one of the following, this means that the update is still in progress. Wait a few minutes and try again.

** `3 nodes are at revision 11; 0 nodes have achieved new revision 12`
** `2 nodes are at revision 11; 1 nodes are at revision 12`
