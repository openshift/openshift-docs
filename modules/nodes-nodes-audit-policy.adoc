= Configuring the audit log policy

You can configure the audit log policy to use when logging requests that come to the API servers.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Edit the `APIServer` resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit apiserver cluster
----

. Update the `spec.audit.profile` field:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: APIServer
metadata:
...
spec:
  audit:
    profile: WriteRequestBodies    <1>
----
<1> Set to `Default`, `WriteRequestBodies`, `AllRequestBodies`, or `None`. The default profile is `Default`.
+
[WARNING]
====
It is not recommended to disable audit logging by using the `None` profile unless you are fully aware of the risks of not logging data that can be beneficial when troubleshooting issues. If you disable audit logging and a support situation arises, you might need to enable audit logging and reproduce the issue in order to troubleshoot properly.
====

. Save the file to apply the changes.

.Verification

* Verify that a new revision of the Kubernetes API server pods is rolled out. It can take several minutes for all nodes to update to the new revision.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get kubeapiserver -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="NodeInstallerProgressing")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'
----
+
Review the `NodeInstallerProgressing` status condition for the Kubernetes API server to verify that all nodes are at the latest revision. The output shows `AllNodesAtLatestRevision` upon successful update:
+
[source,terminal]
----
AllNodesAtLatestRevision
3 nodes are at revision 12 <1>
----
<1> In this example, the latest revision number is `12`.
+
If the output shows a message similar to one of the following messages, the update is still in progress. Wait a few minutes and try again.

** `3 nodes are at revision 11; 0 nodes have achieved new revision 12`
** `2 nodes are at revision 11; 1 nodes are at revision 12`
