* Before this update, Argo CD monitoring worked automatically when deployed in any namespace and user-workload monitoring support for workloads did not require any manual configuration. With this update, if you deploy Argo CD in a non-{OCP} namespace, you must enable user-workload monitoring in {OCP}.
