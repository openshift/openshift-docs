= Gathering log data from a failed Agent-based installation

Use the following procedure to gather log data about a failed Agent-based installation to provide for a support case.

.Procedure

. Run the following command and collect the output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install --dir <install_directory> agent wait-for bootstrap-complete --log-level=debug
----
+
.Example error message
[source,terminal]
----
...
ERROR Bootstrap failed to complete: : bootstrap process timed out: context deadline exceeded
----

. If the output from the previous command indicates a failure, or if the bootstrap is not progressing, run the following command on node 0 and collect the output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh core@<node-ip> sudo /usr/local/bin/agent-gather -O > <local_tmp_path>/agent-gather.tar.xz
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You only need to gather data from node 0, but gathering this data from every node can be helpful.
====

. If the bootstrap completes and the cluster nodes reboot, run the following command and collect the output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install --dir <install_directory> agent wait-for install-complete --log-level=debug
----

. If the output from the previous command indicates a failure, perform the following steps:

.. Export the `kubeconfig` file to your environment by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export KUBECONFIG=<install_directory>/auth/kubeconfig
----

.. To gather information for debugging, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather
----

.. Create a compressed file from the `must-gather` directory that was just created in your working directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ tar cvaf must-gather.tar.gz <must_gather_directory>
----

. Excluding the `/auth` subdirectory, attach the installation directory used during the deployment to your support case on the link:https://access.redhat.com[Red Hat Customer Portal].

. Attach all other data gathered from this procedure to your support case.
