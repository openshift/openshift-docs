= Configuring additional trust stores for image registry access

The `image.config.openshift.io/cluster` resource can contain a reference
to a ConfigMap that contains additional certificate authorities to be trusted
during image registry access.

.Prerequisites
* The CAs must be PEM-encoded.

.Procedure

You can create a ConfigMap in the `openshift-config` namespace and use its name
in `AdditionalTrustedCA` in the `image.config.openshift.io` resource to provide
additional CAs that should be trusted when contacting external registries.

The ConfigMap key is the host name of a registry with the port for which this CA is to be
trusted, and the base64-encoded certificate is the value, for each additional registry CA to trust.

.Image registry CA ConfigMap example
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-registry-ca
data:
  registry.example.com: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  registry-with-port.example.com..5000: | <1>
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----
<1>  If the registry has the port, such as `registry-with-port.example.com:5000`,
`:` should be replaced with `..`.

You can configure additional CAs with the following procedure.

. To configure an additional CA:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create configmap registry-config --from-file=<external_registry_address>=ca.crt -n openshift-config
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit image.config.openshift.io cluster
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  additionalTrustedCA:
    name: registry-config
