= Configuring Curator index deletion

You can configure Elasticsearch Curator to delete Elasticsearch data that uses the data model prior to {product-title} version 4.5. You can configure per-project and global settings. Global settings apply to any project not specified. Per-project settings override global settings.
// Preserve the hard-coded "4.5" in the preceding paragraph. Do not replace it with a product version attribute.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Elasticsearch Curator is deprecated in {product-title} 4.7 (OpenShift Logging 5.0) and will be removed in OpenShift Logging 5.1.
====

.Prerequisites

* Cluster logging must be installed.

.Procedure

To delete indices:

. Edit the {product-title} custom Curator configuration file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit configmap/curator
----

. Set the following parameters as needed:
+
[source,yaml]
----
config.yaml: |
  project_name:
    action
      unit:value
----
+
The available parameters are:
+
.Project options
[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===
|Variable Name
|Description

|`project_name`
|The actual name of a project, such as *myapp-devel*. For {product-title} *operations* logs, use the name `.operations` as the project name.

|`action`
|The action to take, currently only `delete` is allowed.

|`unit`
|The period to use for deletion, `days`, `weeks`, or `months`.

|`value`
|The number of units.
|===
+
.Filter options
[cols="3,7",options="header"]
|===
|Variable Name
|Description

|`.defaults`
|Use `.defaults` as the `project_name` to set the defaults for projects that are not specified.

|`.regex`
|The list of regular expressions that match project names.

|`pattern`
|The valid and properly escaped regular expression pattern enclosed by single quotation marks.

|===

For example, to configure Curator to:

- Delete indices in the *myapp-dev* project older than `1 day`
- Delete indices in the *myapp-qe* project older than `1 week`
- Delete *operations* logs older than `8 weeks`
- Delete all other projects indices after they are `31 days` old
- Delete indices older than 1 day that are matched by the `^project\..+\-dev.*$` regex
- Delete indices older than 2 days that are matched by the `^project\..+\-test.*$` regex

Use:

[source,yaml]
----
  config.yaml: |
    .defaults:
      delete:
        days: 31

    .operations:
      delete:
        weeks: 8

    myapp-dev:
      delete:
        days: 1

    myapp-qe:
      delete:
        weeks: 1

    .regex:
      - pattern: '^project\..+\-dev\..*$'
        delete:
          days: 1
      - pattern: '^project\..+\-test\..*$'
        delete:
          days: 2
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you use `months` as the `$UNIT` for an operation, Curator starts counting at the first day of the current month, not the current day of the current month. For example, if today is April 15, and you want to delete indices that are 2 months older than today (delete: months: 2), Curator does not delete indices that are dated older than February 15; it deletes indices older than February 1. That is, it goes back to the first day of the current month, then goes back two whole months from that date. If you want to be exact with Curator, it is best to use days (for example, `delete: days: 30`).
