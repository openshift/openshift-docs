= Operator catalog access control

When an Operator catalog is created in the global catalog namespace `openshift-marketplace`, the catalog's Operators are made available cluster-wide to all namespaces. A catalog created in other namespaces only makes its Operators available in that same namespace of the catalog.

On clusters where non-cluster administrator users have been delegated Operator installation privileges, cluster administrators might want to further control or restrict the set of Operators those users are allowed to install. This can be achieved with the following actions:

. Disable all of the default global catalogs.
. Enable custom, curated catalogs in the same namespace where the relevant Operator groups have been preinstalled.
