Red{nbsp}Hat's information security roles and responsibilities are not managed by third parties.

Red{nbsp}Hat maintains an ISO 27001 certification for our corporate information security management system (ISMS), which governs how all of our people work, corporate endpoint devices, and authentication and authorization practices. We have taken a standardized approach to this through the implementation of the Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Security Standard (ESS) to all infrastructure, products, services and technology that Red{nbsp}Hat employs. A copy of the ESS is available upon request.

{product-title-managed-short} runs on an instance of OpenShift Dedicated hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). OpenShift Dedicated is compliant with ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, PCI DSS, SOC 2 Type 2, and HIPAA. Strong processes and security controls are aligned with industry standards to manage information security.

{product-title-managed-short} follows the same security principles, guidelines, processes and controls defined for OpenShift Dedicated. These certifications demonstrate how our services platform, associated operations, and management practices align with core security requirements. We meet many of these requirements by following solid Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) practices as defined by NIST, including build pipeline security. Implementation of SSDF controls are implemented via our Secure Software Management Lifecycle (SSML) for all products and services.

Red{nbsp}Hat's proven and experienced global site reliability engineering (SRE) team is available 24x7 and proactively manages the cluster life cycle, infrastructure configuration, scaling, maintenance, security patching, and incident response as it relates to the hosted components of {product-title-managed-short}. The Red{nbsp}Hat SRE team is responsible for managing HA, uptime, backups, restore, and security for the {product-title-managed-short} control plane. {product-title-managed-short} comes with a 99.95% availability SLA and 24x7 RH SRE support by phone or chat.

You are responsible for use of the product, including implementation of policies, vulnerability management, and deployment of secured cluster components within your {ocp} environments. The Red{nbsp}Hat SRE team manages the control plane that contains tenant data in line with the compliance frameworks noted previously, including:

* All Red{nbsp}Hat SRE access the data plane clusters through the backplane which enables audited access to the cluster
* Red{nbsp}Hat SRE only deploys images from the Red{nbsp}Hat registry. All content posted to the Red{nbsp}Hat registry goes through rigorous checks. These images are the same images available to self-managed customers.
* Each tenant has their own individual mTLS CA, which encrypts data in-transit, enabling multi-tenant isolation. Additional isolation is provided via SELinux controls namespaces and network policies.
* Each tenant has their own instance of the RDS database.

All Red{nbsp}Hat SREs and developers go through rigorous Secure Development Lifecycle training.
