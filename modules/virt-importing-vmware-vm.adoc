[id='Importing_vmware_vm_or_template_{context}']
= Importing a VMware virtual machine or template

You can import a VMware virtual machine or template using the virtual machine wizard.

.Prerequisites

* You must create a VDDK image, push it to an image registry, and add it to the `v2v-vmware` ConfigMap.

* There must be sufficient storage space for the imported disk.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you try to import a virtual machine whose disk size is larger than the available storage space, the operation cannot complete. You will not be able to import another virtual machine or to clean up the storage because there are insufficient resources to support object deletion. To resolve this situation, you must add more object storage devices to the storage backend.
====

* The VMware virtual machine must be powered off.

.Procedure

. In the {VirtProductName} web console, click *Workloads* -> *Virtual Machines*.
. Click *Create Virtual Machine* and select *Import with Wizard*.

. In the *General* screen, perform the following steps:
.. Select *VMware* from the *Provider* list.
.. Select *Connect to New Instance* or a saved vCenter instance from the *vCenter instance* list.

** If you select *Connect to New Instance*, fill in the *vCenter hostname*, *Username*, and *Password*.
** If you select a saved vCenter instance, the  wizard connects to the vCenter instance using the saved credentials.

.. Select a virtual machine or a template to import from the *VM or Template to Import* list.
.. Select an operating system.
.. Select an existing flavor or *Custom* from the *Flavor* list.
+
If you select *Custom*, specify the *Memory (GB)* and the *CPUs*.
.. Select a *Workload Profile*.
.. If the virtual machine name is already being used by another virtual machine in the namespace, update the name.
.. Click *Next*.

. In the *Networking* screen, perform the following steps:

.. Click the Options menu {kebab} of a network interface and select *Edit*.
.. Enter a valid network interface name.
+
The name can contain lowercase letters (`a-z`), numbers (`0-9`), and hyphens (`-`), up to a maximum of 253 characters. The first and last characters must be alphanumeric. The name must not contain uppercase letters, spaces, periods (`.`), or special characters.

.. Select the network interface model.

The name can contain lowercase letters (`a-z`), numbers (`0-9`), and hyphens (`-`), up to a maximum of 253 characters. The first and last characters must be alphanumeric. The name must not contain uppercase letters, spaces, periods (`.`), or special characters.

.. Select the interface type.
.. Select the storage class.
+
If you do not select a storage class, {VirtProductName} uses the default storage class to create the virtual machine.

.. Click *Save* and then click *Next*.

. In the *Advanced* screen, enter the *Hostname* and *Authorized SSH Keys* if you are using `cloud-init`.

. Click *Next*.

. Review your settings and click *Create Virtual Machine*.
+
A *Successfully created virtual machine* message and a list of resources created for the virtual machine are displayed. The powered off virtual machine appears in *Workloads* -> *Virtual Machines*.

. Click *See virtual machine details* to view the dashboard of the imported virtual machine.
+
If an error occurs, perform the following steps:

.. Click *Workloads* -> *Pods*.
.. Click the Conversion Pod, for example, `kubevirt-v2v-conversion-rhel7-mini-1-27b9h`.
