= Hub cluster networking

The reference hub cluster is designed to operate in a disconnected networking environment where direct access to the internet is not possible.
As with all {product-title} clusters, the hub cluster requires access to an image registry hosting all OpenShift and Day 2 {olm-first} images.

The hub cluster supports dual-stack networking support for IPv6 and IPv4 networks.
IPv6 is typical in edge or far-edge network segments, while IPv4 is more prevalent for use with legacy equipment in the data center.

Limits and requirements::
+
--
* Regardless of the installation method, you must configure the following network types for the hub cluster:
** `clusterNetwork`
** `serviceNetwork`
** `machineNetwork`

* You must configure the following IP addresses for the hub cluster:
** `apiVIP`
** `ingressVIP`

[NOTE]
====
For the above networking configurations, some values are required, or can be auto-assigned, depending on the chosen architecture and DHCP configuration.
====

* You must use the default {product-title} network provider OVN-Kubernetes.

* Networking between the managed cluster and hub cluster must meet the networking requirements in the {rh-rhacm-first} documentation, for example:
** Hub cluster access to managed cluster API service, Ironic Python agent, and baseboard management controller (BMC) port.
** Managed cluster access to hub cluster API service, ingress IP and control plane node IP addresses.
** Managed cluster BMC access to hub cluster control plane node IP addresses.
* An image registry must be accessible throughout the lifetime of the hub cluster.
** All required container images must be mirrored to the disconnected registry.
** The hub cluster must be configured to use a disconnected registry.
** The hub cluster cannot host its own image registry.
For example, the registry must be available in a scenario where a power failure affects all cluster nodes.

Engineering considerations::
* When deploying a hub cluster, ensure you define appropriately sized CIDR range definitions.
