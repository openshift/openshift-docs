= Managing Networking when NetworkPolicy Isolation mode is enabled

`NetworkPolicy` is the default isolation mode for OpenShift SDN.

When the `NetworkPolicy` isolation mode is enabled in the cluster,
network isolation is controlled entirely by

objects].
By default, all pods in a project are accessible from other pods and
network endpoints. To isolate one or more pods in a project, you can create
`NetworkPolicy` objects in that project to indicate the allowed incoming
connections. Project administrators can create and delete `NetworkPolicy`
objects within their own project.

Pods that do not have `NetworkPolicy` objects pointing to them are fully
accessible, whereas, pods that have one or more `NetworkPolicy` objects pointing
to them are isolated. These isolated pods only accept connections that are
accepted by at least one of their `NetworkPolicy` objects.
