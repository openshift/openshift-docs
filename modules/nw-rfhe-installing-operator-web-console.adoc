.Prerequisites

.. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

.. Choose  *Baremetal Hardware Event Proxy Operator* from the list of available Operators, and then click *Install*.

.. On the *Install Operator* page, select or create a *Namespace* and then select *baremetal-hardware-event-proxy-operator*. Then, click *Install*.

If the operator does not appear as installed, to troubleshoot further:

* Go to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page and inspect the *Operator Subscriptions* and *Install Plans* tabs for any failure or errors under *Status*.
* Go to the *Workloads* -> *Pods* page and check the logs for pods in the project namespace.
