= Using the container image pre-cache feature

Clusters might have limited bandwidth to access the container image registry, which can cause a timeout before the updates are completed.

[NOTE]
====
The time of the update is not set by {cgu-operator}. You can apply the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR at the beginning of the update by manual application or by external automation.
====

The container image pre-caching starts when the `preCaching` field is set to `true` in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR. After a successful pre-caching process, you can start remediating policies. The remediation actions start when the `enable` field is set to `true`.

The pre-caching process can be in the following statuses:

`PrecacheNotStarted`:: This is the initial state all clusters are automatically assigned to on the first reconciliation pass of the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR.
+
In this state, {cgu-operator} deletes any pre-caching namespace and hub view resources of spoke clusters that remain from previous incomplete updates. {cgu-operator} then creates a new `ManagedClusterView` resource for the spoke pre-caching namespace to verify its deletion in the `PrecachePreparing` state.
`PrecachePreparing`:: Cleaning up any remaining resources from previous incomplete updates is in progress.
`PrecacheStarting`:: Pre-caching job prerequisites and the job are created.
`PrecacheActive`:: The job is in "Active" state.
`PrecacheSucceeded`:: The pre-cache job has succeeded.
`PrecacheTimeout`:: The artifact pre-caching has been partially done.
`PrecacheUnrecoverableError`:: The job ends with a non-zero exit code.
