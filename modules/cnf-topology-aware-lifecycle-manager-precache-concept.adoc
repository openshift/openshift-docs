= Using the container image pre-cache feature

{sno-caps} clusters might have limited bandwidth to access the container image registry, which can cause a timeout before the updates are completed.

[NOTE]
====
The time of the update is not set by {cgu-operator}. You can apply the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR at the beginning of the update by manual application or by external automation.
====

The container image pre-caching starts when the `preCaching` field is set to `true` in the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR.

{cgu-operator} uses the `PrecacheSpecValid` condition to report status information as follows:

* `true`
+
The pre-caching spec is valid and consistent.
* `false`
+
The pre-caching spec is incomplete.

{cgu-operator} uses the `PrecachingSucceeded` condition to report status information as follows:

* `true`
+
{cgu-operator} has concluded the pre-caching process. If pre-caching fails for any cluster, the update fails for that cluster but proceeds for all other clusters. A message informs you if pre-caching has failed for any clusters.
* `false`
+
Pre-caching is still in progress for one or more clusters or has failed for all clusters.

After a successful pre-caching process, you can start remediating policies. The remediation actions start when the `enable` field is set to `true`. If there is a pre-caching failure on a cluster, the upgrade fails for that cluster. The upgrade process continues for all other clusters that have a successful pre-cache.

The pre-caching process can be in the following statuses:

* `NotStarted`
+
This is the initial state all clusters are automatically assigned to on the first reconciliation pass of the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR. In this state, {cgu-operator} deletes any pre-caching namespace and hub view resources of spoke clusters that remain from previous incomplete updates. {cgu-operator} then creates a new `ManagedClusterView` resource for the spoke pre-caching namespace to verify its deletion in the `PrecachePreparing` state.
* `PreparingToStart`
+
Cleaning up any remaining resources from previous incomplete updates is in progress.
* `Starting`
+
Pre-caching job prerequisites and the job are created.
* `Active`
+
The job is in "Active" state.
*  `Succeeded`
+
The pre-cache job succeeded.
* `PrecacheTimeout`
+
The artifact pre-caching is partially done.
* `UnrecoverableError`
+
The job ends with a non-zero exit code.
