= Deleting a TLS secret automatically upon Certificate removal

You can enable the `--enable-certificate-owner-ref` flag for the {cert-manager-operator} by adding a `spec.controllerConfig` section in the `CertManager` resource. The `--enable-certificate-owner-ref` flag sets the certificate resource as an owner of the secret where the TLS certificate is stored.

[WARNING]
====
If you uninstall the {cert-manager-operator} or delete certificate resources from the cluster, the secret is deleted automatically. This might cause network connectivity issues depending upon where the certificate TLS secret is being used.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the {product-title} cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the {cert-manager-operator} 1.12.0 or later.

. Edit the `CertManager` resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit certmanager cluster
----

. Add a `spec.controllerConfig` section with the following override arguments:
+
[source,yaml]
----

.Verification

* Verify that the `--enable-certificate-owner-ref` flag is updated for cert-manager controller pod by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=cert-manager -n cert-manager -o yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
