= Setting a log level for the {zero-trust-full}

You can set a log level for the {zero-trust-full} to determine the verbosity of the operator log messages.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have {zero-trust-full} installed.

.Procedure

* Update the subscription object for {zero-trust-full} to provide the verbosity level for the operator logs by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n zero trust workload identity manager patch subscription openshift-zero-trust-workload-identity-manager --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"config":{"env":[{"name":"OPERATOR_LOG_LEVEL","value":"v"}]}}}' <1>
----
<1> Replace `v` with the desired log level number. The valid values for `v` can range from `1`to `10`. The default value is `2`.

.Verification

. The zero trust workload identity manager pod is redeployed. Verify that the log level of the {zero-trust-full} is updated by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc set env deploy/zero-trust-workload-identity-manager -n zero-trust-workload-identity-manager --list | grep -e OPERATOR_LOG_LEVEL -e container
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
# deployments/zero-trust-workload-identity-manager, container kube-rbac-proxy
OPERATOR_LOG_LEVEL=9
# deployments/zero-trust-workload-identity-manager, container cert-manager-operator
OPERATOR_LOG_LEVEL=9
----

. Verify that the log level of the {zero-trust-full} is updated by running the `oc logs` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs deploy/zero-trust-workload-identity-manager -n zero-trust-workload-identity-manager
