= Prioritizing the vulnerabilities

[role="_abstract"]

Answer the following questions to prioritize the vulnerabilities in your environment for action and investigation:

* How important is an affected asset for your organization?
* How severe does a vulnerability need to be for investigation?
* Can the vulnerability be fixed by a patch for the affected software component?
* Does the existence of the vulnerability violate any of your organization's security policies?

The answers to these questions help security and development teams decide if they want to gauge the exposure of a vulnerability.

{product-title} provides you the means to facilitate the prioritization of the vulnerabilities in your applications and components. You can use data reported by {product-title-short} to decide which vulnerabilities are critical to address. For example, when viewing vulnerability findings by CVE, you might want to consider the following data that {product-title-short} provides and that you can use to sort and prioritize vulnerabilities:

* CVE severity: {product-title-short} reports the number of images that are affected by the CVE and its severity rating (for example, low, moderate, important, or critical) from Red{nbsp} Hat Product Security.
* Top CVSS: The highest Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score, from data gathered from Red{nbsp}Hat and vendor sources, of this CVE across images.
* Top NVD CVSS: The highest CVSS score, from the National Vulnerability Database, of this CVE across images. You must have Scanner V4 enabled to view this data.
* EPSS probability: The likelihood that the vulnerability could be exploited according to the link:https://www.first.org/epss/[Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS)]. This EPSS data provides a percentage estimate of the probability that exploitation of this vulnerability will be observed in the next 30 days. The EPSS collects data of observed exploitation activity from partners, and exploitation activity does not mean that an attempted exploitation was successful. The EPSS score should be used as a single data point _along with other information_, such as the age of the CVE, to help you prioritize the vulnerabilities to address. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7106599[{product-title-short} and EPSS].
