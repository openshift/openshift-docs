= Prioritizing the vulnerabilities

[role="_abstract"]

Answer the following questions to prioritize the vulnerabilities in your environment for action and investigation:

* How important is an affected asset for your organization?
* How severe does a vulnerability need to be for investigation?
* Can the vulnerability be fixed by a patch for the affected software component?
* Does the existence of the vulnerability violate any of your organization's security policies?

The answers to these questions help security and development teams decide if they want to gauge the exposure of a vulnerability.

{product-title} provides you the means to facilitate the prioritization of the vulnerabilities in your applications and components.
