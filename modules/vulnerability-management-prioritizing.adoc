= Prioritize the vulnerabilities in your environment

[role="_abstract"]

To prioritize the vulnerabilites in your environment for action and investigation you must answer the following questions:

* How important is this asset to my organization?
* How severe does a vulnerability need to be to merit investigation?
* Is this vulnerability able to be fixed by a patch of the software component?
* Does the existence of this vulnerability violate any of my organizations security policies?

{product-title} provides you the need to facilitate prioritization of the vulnerabilites in your applications and in the Kubernetes components used to run Kubernetes or OpenShift.

The answers to these questions help security and development teams decide if they want to guage the exposure of a vulnerability.
