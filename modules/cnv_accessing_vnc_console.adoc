=== Accessing the graphical console of a VMI with VNC

The `virtctl` client utility can use `remote-viewer` to open a graphical console 
to a running virtual machine instance. This is installed with the `virt-viewer` 
package.

.Prerequisites

* `virt-viewer` must be installed.
* The virtual machine instance you want to access must be running.

[NOTE]
====
If you use `virtctl` via `ssh` on a remote machine, you must 
forward the X session to your machine for this procedure to work.
====

.Procedure

. Connect to the graphical interface with the `virtctl` utility: 
+
----
$ virtctl vnc <VMI>
----
+
If this command is successful, you will now be connected to the graphical 
interface.

. If the command failed, try using the `-v` flag to collect 
troubleshooting information:
+
----
$ virtctl vnc <VMI> -v 4
