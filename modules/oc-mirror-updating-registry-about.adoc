= Updating your mirror registry content

In order to upgrade your disconnected {product-title} cluster, you must update your mirror registry content with updated content from the Red Hat registries.

You can update your registry content by updating the image set configuration file and mirroring the image set to the mirror registry. Every time you run the oc-mirror plugin v1, an image set is generated that only contains new and updated images since the previous execution.

While updating the mirror registry, you must take into account the following considerations:

* Images are pruned from the target mirror registry if they are no longer included in the latest image set that was generated and mirrored. Therefore, ensure that you are updating images for the same combination of the following key components:

** Image set configuration: Modify your existing `ImageSetConfiguration` file to update channels and version selections to align with the desired content in your disconnected registry after completing the mirror operation.

** Target mirror registry: If you specified a top-level namespace for the mirror registry during the initial image set creation, use the same namespace every time you run the oc-mirror plugin v1 for that mirror registry.

** Storage configuration: Retain the exact metadata, either container image or file directory, from your `storageConfig` across runs on the connected side.

* The images can be pruned during the disk-to-mirror or mirror-to-mirror workflow.

* The generated image sets must be pushed to the target mirror registry in sequence. You can derive the sequence number from the file name of the generated image set archive file.

* Do not delete or modify the metadata image that is generated by the oc-mirror plugin v1.
