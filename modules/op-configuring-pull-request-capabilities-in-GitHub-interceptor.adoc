= Configuring pull request capabilities in GitHub Interceptor

With GitHub Interceptor, you can create logic that validates and filters GitHub webhooks. For example, you can validate the webhookâ€™s origin and filter incoming events based on specified criteria. When you use GitHub Interceptor to filter event data, you can specify the event types that Interceptor can accept in a field.
In {pipelines-title}, you can use the following capabilities of GitHub Interceptor:

* Filter pull request events based on the files that have been changed
* Validate pull requests based on configured GitHub owners
