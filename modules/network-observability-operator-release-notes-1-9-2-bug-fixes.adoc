= Network observability 1.9.2 bug fixes

* Before this update, {product-title} versions 4.15 and earlier did not support the `TC_ATTACH_MODE` configuration. This led to command-line interface (CLI) errors and prevented the observation of packets and flows. With this release, the Traffic Control eXtension (TCX) hook attachment mode has been adjusted for these older versions. This eliminates `tcx` hook errors and enables flow and packet observation.
