= Creating a binding connection between components

You can establish a binding connection with Operator-backed components.

This procedure walks through an example of creating a binding connection between a PostgreSQL Database service and a Spring PetClinic sample application. To create a binding connection with a service that is backed by the PostgreSQL Database Operator, you must first add the Red Hat-provided PostgreSQL Database Operator to the *OperatorHub*, and then install the Operator.
The PostreSQL Database Operator then creates and manages the `Database` resource, which exposes the binding information in secrets, config maps, status, and spec attributes.

.Prerequisites

* You have created and deployed a Spring PetClinic sample application by using the *Developer* perspective.
* You have installed {servicebinding-title} from the OperatorHub.
* You have installed the *Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes* Operator from the OperatorHub by using the `v5` *Update* channel.
* You have created and deployed a Crunchy PostgreSQL database instance by using the *Developer* perspective. This instance has the following components: `hippo-backup`, `hippo-instance`, `hippo-repo-host`, and `hippo-pgbouncer`.

.Procedure

. Switch to the *Developer* perspective and ensure that you are in the appropriate project, for example, `my-petclinic`. 
. In the *Topology* view, hover over the Spring PetClinic sample application to see a dangling arrow on the node.
. Click and drag the arrow towards the *hippo* database in the Postgres Cluster to make a binding connection with the Spring PetClinic sample application. 

.. Enter the name and click *Create*.

Alternatively, in the *+Add* view, click the *YAML* option to see the *Import YAML* screen. Use the YAML editor and add the `ServiceBinding` resource:

[source,YAML]
----
apiVersion: binding.operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
    name: spring-petclinic-pgcluster
    namespace: my-petclinic
spec:
    services:
    - group: postgres-operator.crunchydata.com
      version: v1beta1
      kind: PostgresCluster
      name: hippo
    application:
      name: spring-petclinic
      group: apps
      version: v1
      resource: deployments
----

A service binding request is created and the {servicebinding-title} controller projects the database service connection information into the application deployment as files by using a volume mount. After the request is successful, the application is redeployed and the connection is established.

[NOTE]
====
You can also use the context menu by dragging the dangling arrow to add and create a binding connection to an operator-backed service.
