= Configuring image registry repository mirroring

Setting up container registry repository mirroring enables you to perform the following tasks:

* Configure your {product-title} cluster to redirect requests to pull images from a repository on a source image registry and have it resolved by a repository on a mirrored image registry.
* Identify multiple mirrored repositories for each target repository, to make sure that if one mirror is down, another can be used.

Repository mirroring in {product-title} includes the following attributes:

* Image pulls are resilient to registry downtimes.
* Clusters in disconnected environments can pull images from critical locations, such as quay.io, and have registries behind a company firewall provide the requested images.
* A particular order of registries is tried when an image pull request is made, with the permanent registry typically being the last one tried.
* The mirror information you enter is added to the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` file on every node in the {product-title} cluster.
* When a node makes a request for an image from the source repository, it tries each mirrored repository in turn until it finds the requested content. If all mirrors fail, the cluster tries the source repository. If successful, the image is pulled to the node.

Setting up repository mirroring can be done in the following ways:

* At {product-title} installation:
+
By pulling container images needed by {product-title} and then bringing those images behind your company's firewall, you can install {product-title} into a datacenter that is in a disconnected environment.

* After {product-title} installation:
+
If you did not configure mirroring during {product-title} installation, you can do so post-installation by using one of the following custom resource (CR) objects:
+
--
** `ImageDigestMirrorSet`. This CR allows you to pull images from a mirrored registry by using digest specifications.
+
** `ImageTagMirrorSet`. This CR allows you to pull images from a mirrored registry by using image tags.
--
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Using an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` (ICSP) object to configure repository mirroring is a deprecated feature. Deprecated functionality is still included in {product-title} and continues to be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of this product and is not recommended for new deployments. If you have existing YAML files that you used to create `ImageContentSourcePolicy` objects, you can use the `oc adm migrate icsp` command to convert those files to an `ImageDigestMirrorSet` YAML file. For more information, see "Converting ImageContentSourcePolicy (ICSP) files for image registry repository mirroring" in the following section. 
====

Both of these custom resource objects identify the following information:
--
* The source of the container image repository you want to mirror.
* A separate entry for each mirror repository you want to offer the content
requested from the source repository.
--

[NOTE]
====
If your cluster uses an `ImageDigestMirrorSet` or `ImageTagMirrorSet` object to configure repository mirroring, you can use only global pull secrets for mirrored registries. You cannot add a pull secret to a project.
====

The following procedure creates a post-installation mirror configuration, where you create an `ImageDigestMirrorSet` object.

.Prerequisites
* Ensure that you have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

* Ensure that there are no `ImageContentSourcePolicy` objects on your cluster. For example, you can use the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc get ImageContentSourcePolicy
----
+
.Example output
[source, terminal]
----
No resources found
----

.Procedure

. Configure mirrored repositories, by either:
+
* Setting up a mirrored repository with Red Hat Quay, as described in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/manage_red_hat_quay/repo-mirroring-in-red-hat-quay[Red Hat Quay Repository Mirroring]. Using Red Hat Quay allows you to copy images from one repository to another and also automatically sync those repositories repeatedly over time.
* Using a tool such as `skopeo` to copy images manually from the source directory to the mirrored repository.
+
For example, after installing the skopeo RPM package on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 or RHEL 8 system, use the `skopeo` command as shown in this example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ skopeo copy \
docker://registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi-minimal:latest@sha256:5cf... \
docker://example.io/example/ubi-minimal
----
+
In this example, you have a container image registry that is named `example.io` with an image repository named `example` to which you want to copy the `ubi9/ubi-minimal` image from `registry.access.redhat.com`. After you create the registry, you can configure your {product-title} cluster to redirect requests made of the source repository to the mirrored repository.

. Log in to your {product-title} cluster.

. Create an `ImageDigestMirrorSet` or `ImageTagMirrorSet` CR, as needed, replacing the source and mirrors with your own registry and repository pairs and images:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1 <1>
kind: ImageDigestMirrorSet <2>
metadata:
  name: ubi9repo
spec:
  imageDigestMirrors: <3>
  - mirrors:
    - example.io/example/ubi-minimal <4>
    - example.com/example/ubi-minimal <5>
    source: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi-minimal <6>
    mirrorSourcePolicy: AllowContactingSource <7>
  - mirrors:
    - mirror.example.com/redhat
    source: registry.redhat.io/openshift4 <8>
    mirrorSourcePolicy: AllowContactingSource
  - mirrors:
    - mirror.example.com
    source: registry.redhat.io <9>
    mirrorSourcePolicy: AllowContactingSource
  - mirrors:
    - mirror.example.net/image
    source: registry.example.com/example/myimage <10>
    mirrorSourcePolicy: AllowContactingSource
  - mirrors:
    - mirror.example.net
    source: registry.example.com/example <11>
    mirrorSourcePolicy: AllowContactingSource
  - mirrors:
    - mirror.example.net/registry-example-com
    source: registry.example.com <12>
    mirrorSourcePolicy: AllowContactingSource
----
<1> Indicates the API to use with this CR. This must be `config.openshift.io/v1`.
<2> Indicates the kind of object according to the pull type:
** `ImageDigestMirrorSet`: Pulls a digest reference image.
** `ImageTagMirrorSet`: Pulls a tag reference image.
<3> Indicates the type of image pull method, either:
** `imageDigestMirrors`: Use for an `ImageDigestMirrorSet` CR.
** `imageTagMirrors`: Use for an `ImageTagMirrorSet` CR. 
<4> Indicates the name of the mirrored image registry and repository.
<5> Optional: Indicates a secondary mirror repository for each target repository. If one mirror is down, the target repository can use another mirror.
<6> Indicates the registry and repository source, which is the repository that is referred to in image pull specifications.
<7> Optional: Indicates the fallback policy if the image pull fails:
** `AllowContactingSource`: Allows continued attempts to pull the image from the source repository. This is the default. 
** `NeverContactSource`: Prevents continued attempts to pull the image from the source repository.
<8> Optional: Indicates a namespace inside a registry, which allows you to use any image in that namespace. If you use a registry domain as a source, the object is applied to all repositories from the registry.
<9> Optional: Indicates a registry, which allows you to use any image in that registry. If you specify a registry name, the object is applied to all repositories from a source registry to a mirror registry.
<10> Pulls the image `registry.example.com/example/myimage@sha256:...` from the mirror `mirror.example.net/image@sha256:..`.
<11> Pulls the image `registry.example.com/example/image@sha256:...` in the source registry namespace from the mirror `mirror.example.net/image@sha256:...`.
<12> Pulls the image `registry.example.com/myimage@sha256` from the mirror registry `example.net/registry-example-com/myimage@sha256:...`. The `ImageContentSourcePolicy` resource is applied to all repositories from a source registry to a mirror registry `mirror.example.net/registry-example-com`.

. Create the new object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f registryrepomirror.yaml
----
+
After the object is created, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) cordons the nodes as the new settings are deployed to each node. The MCO restarts the nodes for an `ImageTagMirrorSet` object only. The MCO does not restart the nodes for `ImageDigestMirrorSet` objects. When the nodes are uncordoned, the cluster starts using the mirrored repository for requests to the source repository.

. To check that the mirrored configuration settings are applied, do the following on one of the nodes.

.. List your nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get node

.Troubleshooting repository mirroring

If the repository mirroring procedure does not work as described, use the following information about how repository mirroring works to help troubleshoot the problem.

* The first working mirror is used to supply the pulled image.
* The main registry is only used if no other mirror works.
* From the system context, the `Insecure` flags are used as fallback.
* The format of the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` file has changed recently. It is now version 2 and in TOML format.
* You cannot add the same repository to both an `ImageDigestMirrorSet` and an `ImageTagMirrorSet` object.
