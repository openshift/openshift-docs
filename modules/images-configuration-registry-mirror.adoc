= Configuring image registry repository mirroring

Setting up container registry repository mirroring enables you to do the following:

* Configure your {product-title} cluster to redirect requests to pull images from a repository on a source image registry and have it resolved by a repository on a mirrored image registry.
* Identify multiple mirrored repositories for each target repository, to make sure that if one mirror is down, another can be used.

The attributes of repository mirroring in {product-title} include:

* Image pulls are resilient to registry downtimes.
* Clusters in restricted networks can pull images from critical locations, such as quay.io, and have registries behind a company firewall provide the requested images.
* A particular order of registries is tried when an image pull request is made, with the permanent registry typically being the last one tried.
* The mirror information you enter is added to the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` file on every node in the {product-title} cluster.
* When a node makes a request for an image from the source repository, it tries each mirrored repository in turn until it finds the requested content. If all mirrors fail, the cluster tries the source repository. If successful, the image is pulled to the node.

Setting up repository mirroring can be done in the following ways:

* At {product-title} installation:
+
By pulling container images needed by {product-title} and then bringing those images behind your company's firewall, you can install {product-title} into a datacenter that is in a restricted network.

* After {product-title} installation:
+
Even if you don't configure mirroring during {product-title} installation, you can do so later using the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object.

The following procedure provides a post-installation mirror configuration, where you create an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object that identifies:
--
* The source of the container image repository you want to mirror.
* A separate entry for each mirror repository you want to offer the content
requested from the source repository.
--

[NOTE]
====
You can only configure global pull secrets for clusters that have an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object. You cannot add a pull secret to a project.
====

.Prerequisites
* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Configure mirrored repositories, by either:
+
* Setting up a mirrored repository with Red Hat Quay, as described in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/manage_red_hat_quay/repo-mirroring-in-red-hat-quay[Red Hat Quay Repository Mirroring]. Using Red Hat Quay allows you to copy images from one repository to another and also automatically sync those repositories repeatedly over time.
* Using a tool such as `skopeo` to copy images manually from the source directory to the mirrored repository.
+
For example, after installing the skopeo RPM package on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 or RHEL 8 system, use the `skopeo` command as shown in this example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ skopeo copy \
docker://registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal@sha256:5cfbaf45ca96806917830c183e9f37df2e913b187adb32e89fd83fa455ebaa6 \
docker://example.io/example/ubi-minimal
----
+
In this example, you have a container image registry that is named `example.io` with an image repository named `example` to which you want to copy the `ubi8/ubi-minimal` image from `registry.access.redhat.com`. After you create the registry, you can configure your {product-title} cluster to redirect requests made of the source repository to the mirrored repository.

. Log in to your {product-title} cluster.

. Create an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` file (for example, `registryrepomirror.yaml`), replacing the source and mirrors with your own registry and repository pairs and images:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ImageContentSourcePolicy
metadata:
  name: ubi8repo
spec:
  repositoryDigestMirrors:
  - mirrors:
    - example.io/example/ubi-minimal <1>
    - example.com/example/ubi-minimal <2>
    source: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal <3>
  - mirrors:
    - mirror.example.com/redhat
    source: registry.redhat.io/openshift4 <4>
  - mirrors:
    - mirror.example.com
    source: registry.redhat.io <5>
  - mirrors:
    - mirror.example.net/image
    source: registry.example.com/example/myimage <6>
  - mirrors:
    - mirror.example.net
    source: registry.example.com/example <7>
  - mirrors:
    - mirror.example.net/registry-example-com
    source: registry.example.com <8>
----
<1> Indicates the name of the image registry and repository.
<2> Indicates multiple mirror repositories for each target repository. If one mirror is down, the target repository can use another mirror.
<3> Indicates the registry and repository containing the content that is mirrored.
<4> You can configure a namespace inside a registry to use any image in that namespace. If you use a registry domain as a source, the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` resource is applied to all repositories from the registry.
<5> If you configure the registry name, the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` resource is applied to all repositories from a source registry to a mirror registry.
<6> Pulls the image `mirror.example.net/image@sha256:...`.
<7> Pulls the image `myimage` in the source registry namespace from the mirror `mirror.example.net/myimage@sha256:...`.
<8> Pulls the image `registry.example.com/example/myimage` from the mirror registry `mirror.example.net/registry-example-com/example/myimage@sha256:...`. The `ImageContentSourcePolicy` resource is applied to all repositories from a source registry to a mirror registry `mirror.example.net/registry-example-com`.

. Create the new `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f registryrepomirror.yaml
----
+
After the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object is created, the new settings are deployed to each node and the cluster starts using the mirrored repository for requests to the source repository.

. To check that the mirrored configuration settings, are applied, do the following on one of the nodes.

.. List your nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get node

.Troubleshooting repository mirroring

If the repository mirroring procedure does not work as described, use the following information about how repository mirroring works to help troubleshoot the problem.

* The first working mirror is used to supply the pulled image.
* The main registry is only used if no other mirror works.
* From the system context, the `Insecure` flags are used as fallback.
* The format of the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` file has changed recently. It is now version 2 and in TOML format.
