= Configuring image registry repository mirroring
Setting up container registry repository mirroring enables you to:

* configure your {product-title} cluster to redirect requests
to pull images from a repository on a source image registry and have
it resolved by a repository on a mirrored image registry
* identify multiple mirrored repositories for each target
repository, to make sure that if one mirror is down, another
can be used

The attributes of repository mirroring in {product-title} include:

* Image pulls are resilient to registry downtimes.
* Clusters in restricted networks can pull
images from critical locations (such as quay.io)
and have registries behind a company firewall
provide the requested images.
* A particular order of registries is tried when
an image pull request is made, with the permanent
registry typically being the last one tried.
* The mirror information you enter is added to the `/etc/containers/registries.conf`
file on every node in the {product-title} cluster.
* When a node makes a request for an image from the source repository, it
tries each mirrored repository in turn until it finds the requested content.
If all mirrors fail, the cluster tries the source repository. Upon success, the
image is pulled to the node.

Setting up repository mirroring can be done in the following ways:

* At {product-title} installation: By pulling container images needed
by {product-title} and then bringing those images behind your company's
firewall, you can install {product-title} into a
datacenter that is in a restricted network. See
Mirroring the {product-title} image repository for details.

* After {product-title} installation: Even if you don't configure mirroring during {product-title}
installation, you can do so later using the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object.

The following procedure provides a post-installation mirror configuration, where you create an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object that identifies:

* the source of the container image repository you want to mirror
* a separate entry for each mirror repository you want to offer the content
requested from the source repository.

.Prerequisites
* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.


.Procedure

. Configure mirrored repositories, by either:
+
* Setting up a mirrored repository with Red Hat Quay, as
described in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html/manage_red_hat_quay/repo-mirroring-in-red-hat-quay[Red Hat Quay Repository Mirroring].
Using Red Hat Quay allows you to copy images from one repository to another
and also automatically sync those repositories repeatedly over time.
* Using a tool such as `skopeo` to copy images manually
from the source directory to the mirrored repository.
+
For example, after installing the skopeo RPM package
on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux
(RHEL 7 or RHEL 8) system, use the `skopeo` command as shown in this example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ skopeo copy \
docker://registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal@sha256:5cfbaf45ca96806917830c183e9f37df2e913b187adb32e89fd83fa455ebaa6 \
docker://example.io/example/ubi-minimal
----
+
In this example, you have a container image registry that is named
`example.io` with an image repository named `example` to which
you want to copy the `ubi8/ubi-minimal` image from
`registry.access.redhat.com`.
After you create the registry, you can configure your {product-title}
cluster to redirect requests made of the source repository to the
mirrored repository.

. Log in to your {product-title} cluster.

. Create an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` file (for example,
`registryrepomirror.yaml`), replacing the source and
mirrors with your own registry and repository pairs and images:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ImageContentSourcePolicy
metadata:
  name: ubi8repo
spec:
  repositoryDigestMirrors:
  - mirrors:
    - example.io/example/ubi-minimal <1>
    source: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal <2>
  - mirrors:
    - example.com/example/ubi-minimal
    source: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal
----
<1> Indicates the name of the image registry and repository
<2> Indicates the registry and repository containing the content that is mirrored

. Create the new `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f registryrepomirror.yaml
----
+
After the `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object is created,
the new settings are deployed to each node and
the cluster starts using the mirrored repository
for requests to the source repository.

. To check that the mirrored configuration settings,
are applied, do the following on one of the nodes.

.. List your nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get node
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                           STATUS                     ROLES    AGE  VERSION

ip-10-0-153-12.ec2.internal    Ready                      worker   7m   v1.20.0
ip-10-0-154-10.ec2.internal    Ready                      master   11m  v1.20.0
----
+
You can see that scheduling on each worker node is disabled as the change is being applied.

.. Start the debugging process to access the node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/ip-10-0-147-35.ec2.internal
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Starting pod/ip-10-0-147-35ec2internal-debug ...
To use host binaries, run `chroot /host`
----

.. Access the node's files:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# chroot /host
----

.. Check the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` file to make sure
the changes were made:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# cat /etc/containers/registries.conf
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
unqualified-search-registries = ["registry.access.redhat.com", "docker.io"]
[[registry]]
  location = "registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/"
  insecure = false
  blocked = false
  mirror-by-digest-only = true
  prefix = ""

  [[registry.mirror]]
    location = "example.io/example/ubi8-minimal"
    insecure = false

  [[registry.mirror]]
    location = "example.com/example/ubi8-minimal"
    insecure = false
----

.. Pull an image digest to the node from the source and check if it is 
resolved by the mirror. `ImageContentSourcePolicy` objects support image digests only, not image tags.
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# podman pull --log-level=debug registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal@sha256:5cfbaf45ca96806917830c183e9f37df2e913b187adb32e89fd83fa455ebaa6

.Troubleshooting repository mirroring

If the repository mirroring procedure does not work as described, use
the following information about how repository mirroring works to help
troubleshoot the problem.

* The first working mirror is used to supply the pulled image.
* The main registry will only be used if no other mirror works.
* From the system context, the `Insecure` flags are used as fallback.
* The format of the `/etc/containers/registries` file has
changed recently. It is now version 2 and in TOML format.
