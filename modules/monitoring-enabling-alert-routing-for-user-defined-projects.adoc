= Enabling alert routing for user-defined projects

In {product-title}, an administrator can enable alert routing for user-defined projects.
This process consists of the following steps:

ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* Enable alert routing for user-defined projects:
** Use the default platform Alertmanager instance.
** Use a separate Alertmanager instance only for user-defined projects.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* Enable alert routing for user-defined projects to use a separate Alertmanager instance.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* Grant users permission to configure alert routing for user-defined projects.

After you complete these steps, developers and other users can configure custom alerts and alert routing for their user-defined projects.
