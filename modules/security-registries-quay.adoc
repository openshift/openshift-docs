= Storing containers using Red Hat Quay
link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-quay[Red Hat Quay] is an
enterprise-quality container registry product from Red Hat.
Development for Red Hat Quay is done through the upstream
link:https://docs.projectquay.io/welcome.html[Project Quay].
Red Hat Quay is available to deploy on-premise or through the hosted
version of Red Hat Quay at link:https://quay.io[Quay.io].

Security-related features of Red Hat Quay include:

* *Time machine*: Allows images with older tags to expire after a set
period of time or based on a user-selected expiration time.

* *link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/index#repo-mirroring-in-red-hat-quay[Repository mirroring]*: Lets you mirror
other registries for security reasons, such hosting a public repository
on Red Hat Quay behind a company firewall, or for performance reasons, to
keep registries closer to where they are used.

* *Action log storage*: Save Red Hat Quay logging output to link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/index#proc_manage-log-storage[Elasticsearch storage]
to allow for later search and analysis.

* *link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/index#quay-security-scanner[Clair security scanning]*: Scan images against a variety of Linux
vulnerability databases, based on the origins of each container image.

* *Internal authentication*: Use the default local database to handle RBAC
authentication to Red Hat Quay or choose from LDAP, Keystone (OpenStack),
JWT Custom Authentication, or External Application Token authentication.

* *External authorization (OAuth)*: Allow authorization to Red Hat Quay
from GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Google Authentication.

* *Access settings*: Generate tokens to allow access to Red Hat Quay
from docker, rkt, anonymous access, user-created accounts, encrypted
client passwords, or prefix username autocompletion.

Ongoing integration of Red Hat Quay with {product-title} continues,
with several {product-title} Operators of particular interest.
The link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/index#quay-bridge-operator[Quay Bridge Operator]
lets you replace the internal {product-title} registry with Red Hat Quay.
The link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/index#container-security-operator-setup[{rhq-cso}]
lets you check vulnerabilities of images running in {product-title} that were
pulled from Red Hat Quay registries.
