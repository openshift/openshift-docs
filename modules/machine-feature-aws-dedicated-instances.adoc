= Dedicated Instance configuration options

You can deploy machines that are backed by Dedicated Instances on {aws-first} clusters. 

Dedicated Instances run in a virtual private cloud (VPC) on hardware that is dedicated to a single customer. 
These Amazon EC2 instances are physically isolated at the host hardware level. 
The isolation of Dedicated Instances occurs even if the instances belong to different AWS accounts that are linked to a single payer account. 
However, other instances that are not dedicated can share hardware with Dedicated Instances if they belong to the same AWS account.

{product-title} supports instances with public or dedicated tenancy.
