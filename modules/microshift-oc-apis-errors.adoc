= {OCP} CLI tool (`oc`) and {product-title}

Not all {OCP} CLI tool (`oc`) commands are relevant for {product-title} deployments. When you use `oc` to make a request call against an unsupported API, the `oc` binary can generate an error message about a resource that cannot be found.

.Example output

For example, when the following `new-project` command is run:

[source, terminal]
----
$ oc new-project test
----

The error following error message can be generated:

[source, terminal]
----
Error from server (NotFound): the server could not find the requested resource (get projectrequests.project.openshift.io)
----

And when the `get projects` command is run, another error can be generated as follows:

[source, terminal]
----
$ oc get projects
error: the server doesn't have a resource type "projects"
----
