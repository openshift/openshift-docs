= Disabling the Machine Config Operator from automatically rebooting

When configuration changes are made by the Machine Config Operator (MCO), {op-system-first} must reboot for the changes to take effect. Whether the configuration change is automatic or manual, an {op-system} node reboots automatically unless it is paused.

[NOTE]
====
The following modifications do not trigger a node reboot:

* When the MCO detects any of the following changes, it applies the update without draining or rebooting the node:

** Changes to the SSH key in the `spec.config.passwd.users.sshAuthorizedKeys` parameter of a machine config.
** Changes to the global pull secret or pull secret in the `openshift-config` namespace.
** Automatic rotation of the `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet-ca.crt` certificate authority (CA) by the Kubernetes API Server Operator.

* When the MCO detects changes to the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` file, such as adding or editing an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object, it drains the corresponding nodes, applies the changes, and uncordons the nodes.
====

To avoid unwanted disruptions, you can modify the machine config pool (MCP) to prevent automatic rebooting after the Operator makes changes to the machine config.

[NOTE]
====
Pausing an MCP prevents the MCO from applying any configuration changes on the associated nodes. Pausing an MCP also prevents any automatically-rotated certificates from being pushed to the associated nodes, including the automatic rotation of the `kube-apiserver-to-kubelet-signer` CA certificate. If the MCP is paused when the `kube-apiserver-to-kubelet-signer` CA certificate expires, and the MCO attempts to renew the certificate automatically, the new certificate is created but not applied across the nodes in the paused MCP. This causes failure in multiple `oc` commands, including but not limited to `oc debug`, `oc logs`, `oc exec`, and `oc attach`. Pausing an MCP should be done with careful consideration about the `kube-apiserver-to-kubelet-signer` CA certificate expiration and for short periods of time only.

New CA certificates are generated at 292 days from the installation date and removed at 365 days from that date. To determine the next automatic CA certificate rotation, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/5651701[Understand CA cert auto renewal in Red Hat OpenShift 4].
