= Disabling the Machine Config Operator from automatically rebooting

[role="_abstract"]
When configuration changes are made by the Machine Config Operator (MCO), {op-system-first} must reboot for the changes to take effect. Whether the configuration change is automatic or manual, an {op-system} node reboots automatically unless it is paused.

[NOTE]

To avoid unwanted disruptions, you can modify the machine config pool (MCP) to prevent automatic rebooting after the Operator makes changes to the machine config.
