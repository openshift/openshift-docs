= Disabling the Machine Config Operator from automatically rebooting

When configuration changes are made by the Machine Config Operator (MCO), {op-system-first} must reboot for the changes to take effect. Whether the configuration change is automatic or manual, an {op-system} node reboots automatically unless it is paused.

[NOTE]
====
The following modifications do not trigger a node reboot:

* When the MCO detects any of the following changes, it applies the update without draining or rebooting the node:

** Changes to the SSH key in the `spec.config.passwd.users.sshAuthorizedKeys` parameter of a machine config.
** Changes to the global pull secret or pull secret in the `openshift-config` namespace.
** Automatic rotation of the `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet-ca.crt` certificate authority (CA) by the Kubernetes API Server Operator.

* When the MCO detects changes to the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` file, such as adding or editing an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object, it drains the corresponding nodes, applies the changes, and uncordons the nodes.
====

To avoid unwanted disruptions, you can modify the machine config pool (MCP) to prevent automatic rebooting after the Operator makes changes to the machine config.

[NOTE]
====
Pausing a machine config pool stops all system reboot processes and all configuration changes from being applied.
