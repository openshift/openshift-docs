= Disabling the Machine Config Operator from automatically rebooting

When configuration changes are made by the Machine Config Operator (MCO), {op-system-first} must reboot for the changes to take effect. Whether the configuration change is automatic, such as when a `kube-apiserver-to-kubelet-signer` certificate authority (CA) is rotated, or manual, an {op-system} node reboots automatically unless it is paused.

[NOTE]
====
The following modifications do not trigger a node reboot:

* changes to the SSH key in the `spec.config.ignition.passwd.users.sshAuthorizedKeys` parameter of a machine config
* changes to the global pull secret or pull secret in the `openshift-config` namespace
* changes to the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` file, such as adding or editing an `ImageContentSourcePolicy` object

When the MCO detects any of these changes, it drains the corresponding nodes, applies the changes, and uncordons the nodes.
====

To avoid unwanted disruptions, you can modify the machine config pool (MCP) to prevent automatic rebooting after the Operator makes changes to the machine config.

[NOTE]
====
Pausing a machine config pool stops all system reboot processes and all configuration changes from being applied.
