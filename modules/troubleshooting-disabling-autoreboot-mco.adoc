= Disabling the Machine Config Operator from automatically rebooting

When configuration changes are made by the Machine Config Operator, {op-system-first} must reboot for the changes to take effect. Whether the configuration change is automatic, such as when a `kube-apiserver-to-kubelet-signer` CA is rotated, or manual, such as when a registry or SSH key is updated, an {op-system} node reboots automatically unless it is paused.

To avoid unwanted disruptions, you can modify the machine config pool (MCP) to prevent automatic rebooting after the Operator makes changes to the machine config.

[NOTE]
====
Pausing a machine config pool stops all system reboot processes and all configuration changes from being applied.
