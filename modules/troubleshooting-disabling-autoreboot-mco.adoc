= Disabling the Machine Config Operator from automatically rebooting

When configuration changes are made by the Machine Config Operator (MCO), {op-system-first} must reboot for the changes to take effect. Whether the configuration change is automatic or manual, an {op-system} node reboots automatically unless it is paused.

[NOTE]

To avoid unwanted disruptions, you can modify the machine config pool (MCP) to prevent automatic rebooting after the Operator makes changes to the machine config.

[NOTE]
====
Pausing an MCP prevents the MCO from applying any configuration changes on the associated nodes. Pausing an MCP also prevents any automatically rotated certificates from being pushed to the associated nodes, including the automatic rotation of the `kube-apiserver-to-kubelet-signer` CA certificate.

If the MCP is paused when the `kube-apiserver-to-kubelet-signer` CA certificate expires, and the MCO attempts to renew the certificate automatically, the MCO cannot push the newly rotated certificates to those nodes. This causes the cluster to become degraded and causes failure in multiple `oc` commands, including `oc debug`, `oc logs`, `oc exec`, and `oc attach`. You receive alerts in the Alerting UI of the {product-title} web console if an MCP is paused when the certificates are rotated.

Pausing an MCP should be done with careful consideration about the `kube-apiserver-to-kubelet-signer` CA certificate expiration and for short periods of time only.

New CA certificates are generated at 292 days from the installation date and removed at 365 days from that date. To determine the next automatic CA certificate rotation, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/5651701[Understand CA cert auto renewal in Red Hat OpenShift 4].
