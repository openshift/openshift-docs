= Adding a custom certificate to the API server for a hosted cluster

The process to add API server certificates differs depending on whether you use hosted clusters or standalone {product-title} clusters. 

.Prerequisites

* You must have a certificate for the FQDN and its corresponding private key. Each certificate must be in a separate PEM format file.

* The private key must be unencrypted. If your key is encrypted, decrypt it before you import it into {product-title}.

* The certificate must include the `subjectAltName` extension that shows the FQDN.

* The certificate file can contain one or more certificates in a chain. The certificate for the API server FQDN must be the first certificate in the file. It can then be followed with any intermediate certificates, and the file must end with the root CA certificate.

.Procedure

[WARNING]
====
Do not provide a named certificate for the internal load balancer (host name `api-int.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`). Doing so leaves your cluster in a degraded state.
====

.Procedure

. Log in to the new API as the `kubeadmin` user by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login -u kubeadmin -p <password> https://FQDN:6443
----

. Get the `kubeconfig` file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc config view --flatten > kubeconfig-newapi
----

. Create a secret that contains the certificate chain and private key in the `openshift-config` namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create secret tls <secret> \//<1>
     --cert=</path/to/cert.crt> \//<2>
     --key=</path/to/cert.key> \//<3>
     -n openshift-config
----
<1> `<secret>` is the name of the secret that will contain the certificate chain and private key.
<2> `</path/to/cert.crt>` is the path to the certificate chain on your local file system.
<3> `</path/to/cert.key>` is the path to the private key associated with this certificate.

. Update the API server to reference the created secret by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch apiserver cluster \
     --type=merge -p \
     '{"spec":{"servingCerts": {"namedCertificates":
     [{"names": ["<FQDN>"], //<1>
     "servingCertificate": {"name": "<secret>"}}]}}}' <2>
----
<1> Replace `<FQDN>` with the FQDN that the API server should provide the certificate for.
<2> Replace `<secret>` with the name used for the secret in the previous step.

. Examine the `apiserver/cluster` object and confirm the secret is now referenced by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get apiserver cluster -o yaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
...
spec:
  servingCerts:
    namedCertificates:
    - names:
      - <FQDN>
      servingCertificate:
        name: <secret>
...
----

. Check the `kube-apiserver` operator by running the following command, and verify that a new revision of the Kubernetes API server rolls out. It might take a minute for the operator to detect the configuration change and start a new deployment. While the new revision is rolling out, the `PROGRESSING` status is `True`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusteroperators kube-apiserver
----
+
Do not continue to the next step until the `PROGRESSING` status is `False`, as shown in the following output:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
NAME             VERSION   AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   DEGRADED   SINCE
kube-apiserver   {product-version}.0     True        False         False      145m
----
+
If the `PROGRESSING` status is `True`, wait a few minutes and try again.
+
[NOTE]
====
A new revision of the Kubernetes API server rolls out only if the API server-named certificate is added for the first time. When the API server-named certificate is renewed, a new revision of the Kubernetes API server does not roll out because the `kube-apiserver` pods dynamically reload the updated certificate.
