= Creating custom domain mapping for a service

To map a custom domain name to a service you must create a `DomainMapping` custom resource (CR).

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving are installed on your cluster.
* You have created a Knative service and control a custom domain that you want to map to that service.
+
[NOTE]
====
Your custom domain must point to the DNS of the {product-title} cluster.
====

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file containing the `DomainMapping` CR in the same namespace as the Knative service you want to map to:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: DomainMapping
metadata:
 name: <domain_name> <1>
 namespace: <namespace> <2>
spec:
 ref:
   name: <service_name> <3>
   kind: Service
   apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
----
<1> The custom domain name that you want to map to the service.
<2> The namespace of both the `DomainMapping` CR and the Knative service.
<3> The name of the service to map to the custom domain.

. Apply the `DomainMapping` CR as a YAML file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>
