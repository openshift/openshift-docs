= OpenTelemetry Collector configuration options

The OpenTelemetry Collector consists of five types of components that access telemetry data:

Receivers:: A receiver, which can be push or pull based, is how data gets into the Collector. Generally, a receiver accepts data in a specified format, translates it into the internal format, and passes it to processors and exporters defined in the applicable pipelines. By default, no receivers are configured. One or more receivers must be configured. Receivers may support one or more data sources.

Processors:: Optional. Processors process the data between it is received and exported. By default, no processors are enabled. Processors must be enabled for every data source. Not all processors support all data sources. Depending on the data source, multiple processors might be enabled. Note that the order of processors matters.

Exporters:: An exporter, which can be push or pull based, is how you send data to one or more back ends or destinations. By default, no exporters are configured. One or more exporters must be configured. Exporters can support one or more data sources. Exporters might be used with their default settings, but many exporters require configuration to specify at least the destination and security settings.

Connectors:: A connector connects two pipelines. It consumes data as an exporter at the end of one pipeline and emits data as a receiver at the start of another pipeline. It can consume and emit data of the same or different data type. It can generate and emit data to summarize the consumed data, or it can merely replicate or route data.

Extensions:: An extension adds capabilities to the Collector. For example, authentication can be added to the receivers and exporters automatically.

You can define multiple instances of components in a custom resource YAML file. When configured, these components must be enabled through pipelines defined in the `spec.config.service` section of the YAML file. As a best practice, only enable the components that you need.

[id="memorylimiter-processor_{context}"]
==== Memory Limiter processor

The Memory Limiter processor periodically checks the Collector's memory usage and pauses data processing when the soft memory limit is reached. This processor supports traces, metrics, and logs. The preceding component, which is typically a receiver, is expected to retry sending the same data and may apply a backpressure to the incoming data. When memory usage exceeds the hard limit, the Memory Limiter processor forces garbage collection to run.

|Spike limit, which is the maximum expected spike of memory usage in MiB. The optimal value is approximately 20% of `limit_mib`. To calculate the soft limit, subtract the `spike_limit_mib` from the `limit_mib`.
|20% of `limit_mib`

|limit_percentage
|Same as the `limit_mib` but expressed as a percentage of the total available memory. The `limit_mib` setting takes precedence over this setting.
|`0`

|spike_limit_percentage
|Same as the `spike_limit_mib` but expressed as a percentage of the total available memory. Intended to be used with the `limit_percentage` setting.
|`0`

[id="resource-detection-processor_{context}"]
==== Resource Detection processor

The Resource Detection processor is currently a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview] feature only.

The Resource Detection processor identifies host resource details in alignment with OpenTelemetry's resource semantic standards. Using the detected information, it can add or replace the resource values in telemetry data. This processor supports traces, metrics, and can be used with multiple detectors such as the Docket metadata detector or the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable detector.

[id="attributes-processor_{context}"]
==== Attributes processor

The Attributes processor is currently a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview] feature only.

The Attributes processor can modify attributes of a span, log, or metric. You can configure this processor to filter and match input data and include or exclude such data for specific actions.

The processor operates on a list of actions, executing them in the order specified in the configuration. The following actions are supported:

Insert:: Inserts a new attribute into the input data when the specified key does not already exist.

Update:: Updates an attribute in the input data if the key already exists.

Upsert:: Combines the insert and update actions: Inserts a new attribute if the key does not exist yet. Updates the attribute if the key already exists.

Delete:: Removes an attribute from the input data.

Hash:: Hashes an existing attribute value as SHA1.

Extract:: Extracts values by using a regular expression rule from the input key to the target keys defined in the rule. If a target key already exists, it will be overridden similarly to the Span processor's `to_attributes` setting with the existing attribute as the source.

Convert:: Converts an existing attribute to a specified type.

Attributes represent the actions that are applied to the resource attributes, such as delete the attribute, insert the attribute, or upsert the attribute.

[id="span-processor_{context}"]
==== Span processor

The Span processor is currently a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview] feature only.

The Span processor modifies the span name based on its attributes or extracts the span attributes from the span name. It can also change the span status. It can also include or exclude spans. This processor supports traces.

Span renaming requires specifying attributes for the new name by using the `from_attributes` configuration.

          separator: <value> # <2>
----
<1> Defines the keys to form the new span name.
<2> An optional separator.

You can use the processor to extract attributes from the span name.

              - ^\/api\/v1\/document\/(?P<documentId>.*)\/update$ # <1>
----
<1> This rule defines how the extraction is to be executed. You can define more rules: for example, in this case, if the regular expression matches the name, a `documentID` attibute is created. In this example, if the input span name is `/api/v1/document/12345678/update`, this results in the `/api/v1/document/{documentId}/update` output span name, and a new `"documentId"="12345678"` attribute is added to the span.

You can have the span status modified.

[id="kubernetes-attributes-processor_{context}"]
==== Kubernetes Attributes processor

The Kubernetes Attributes processor is currently a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview] feature only.

The Kubernetes Attributes processor enables automatic configuration of spans, metrics, and log resource attributes by using the Kubernetes metadata.
This processor supports traces, metrics, and logs.
This processor automatically identifies the Kubernetes resources, extracts the metadata from them, and incorporates this extracted metadata as resource attributes into relevant spans, metrics, and logs. It utilizes the Kubernetes API to discover all pods operating within a cluster, maintaining records of their IP addresses, pod UIDs, and other relevant metadata.

=== Filter processor

The Filter processor is currently a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview] feature only.

The Filter processor leverages the OpenTelemetry Transformation Language to establish criteria for discarding telemetry data. If any of these conditions are satisfied, the telemetry data are discarded. The conditions can be combined by using the logical OR operator. This processor supports traces, metrics, and logs.

=== Routing processor

The Routing processor is currently a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview] feature only.

The Routing processor routes logs, metrics, or traces to specific exporters. This processor can read a header from an incoming HTTP request (gRPC or plain HTTP) or can read a resource attribute, and then directs the trace information to relevant exporters according to the read value.
