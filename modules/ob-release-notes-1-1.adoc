= Release notes for {builds-shortname} General Availability 1.1

[role="_abstract"]
{builds-shortname} General Availability (GA) 1.1 is now available on {ocp-product-title} 4.16.

[id="new-features-1-1_{context}"]
== New features

The new features in {builds-shortname} 1.1 include the following:

* The builds controllers now use Tekton's V1 API to create and access the `TaskRun` that backs a `BuildRun`.

* With this release, you can now define a build without any source. This is useful if you want to run the build using only the local source.

* The output image section now supports an optional timestamp field to change the image creation timestamp. Use the `SourceTimestamp` string to set it to match the source timestamp.

* With this release, the `.source.type` field is now required in both `build` and `buildRun`.

* With this release, the Operator now installs Shipwright by default and introduces several user experience enhancements for Builds.

* The Shared Resource CSI Driver is now generally available. With this release, the CSI Shared Driver enables sharing of `ConfigMaps` and secrets across different namespaces in Kubernetes clusters. The driver has permission to read all Kubernetes secrets. This feature improves resource efficiency by reducing duplication and simplifies configuration management in multi-tenant environments. Administrators can define access policies to control which namespaces can read or modify these shared resources.
