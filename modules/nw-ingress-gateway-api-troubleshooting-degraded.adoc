= Ingress Operator is Degraded due to Gateway API and OSSM conflict

In [product-title] 4.20 and later, if you create a `GatewayClass` resource while a conflicting OpenShift Service Mesh (OSSM) v2.x subscription exists, the `ingress` Cluster Operator (CIO) reports a `Degraded` status. This procedure details how to verify and resolve this conflict.

This occurs because the Gateway API implementation requires OSSM v3.x, which cannot coexist with OSSM v2.x. The CIO detects this conflict, stops the Gateway API provisioning, and reports the `Degraded` status to alert administrators.

.Verification

. Check the `ingress` Cluster Operator status:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusteroperator ingress -o yaml
----

. In the `status` section of the output, look for a `Degaded` condition with `status: "True"` and a `reason: GatewayAPIOSSMConflict`.

.Example Degraded status message
[source,yaml]
----
status:
  conditions:

    lastTransitionTime: "2025-10-22T17:00:00Z"

    message: 'Failed to install OpenShift Service Mesh 3.x for Gateway API: A
      conflicting OpenShift Service Mesh 2.x subscription was found. Remove the
      GatewayClass resource or the conflicting OSSM 2.x subscription to resolve.'
    reason: GatewayAPIOSSMConflict
    status: "True"
    type: Degraded
----

.Procedure

To resolve this issue and clear the `Degraded` status, choose one of the following options:

* If you **do not** intend to use the OpenShift Gateway API, remove the `GatewayClass` resource. This signals to the Ingress Operator to stop attempting to provision Gateway API.

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete gatewayclass <gatewayclass-name>
----

* If you **do** intend to use the OpenShift Gateway API, you must remove the conflicting OpenShift Service Mesh v2.x subscription from the cluster. After the v2.x subscription is removed, the Ingress Operator automatically retries the installation of OSSM v3.x and completes the Gateway API provisioning.
