= Versioning for {hcp}

With each major, minor, or patch version release of {product-title}, two components of {hcp} are released:

* The HyperShift Operator
* The `hcp` command-line interface (CLI)

The HyperShift Operator manages the lifecycle of hosted clusters that are represented by the `HostedCluster` API resources. The HyperShift Operator is released with each {product-title} release. The HyperShift Operator creates the `supported-versions` config map in the `hypershift` namespace. The config map contains the supported hosted cluster versions.

You can host different versions of control planes on the same management cluster.

.Example `supported-versions` config map object
[source,yaml]
----
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      supported-versions: '{"versions":["4.15"]}'
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      labels:
        hypershift.openshift.io/supported-versions: "true"
      name: supported-versions
      namespace: hypershift
----

You can use the `hcp` CLI to create hosted clusters.

You can use the `hypershift.openshift.io` API resources, such as, `HostedCluster` and `NodePool`, to create and manage {product-title} clusters at scale. A `HostedCluster` resource contains the control plane and common data plane configuration. When you create a `HostedCluster` resource, you have a fully functional control plane with no attached nodes. A `NodePool` resource is a scalable set of worker nodes that is attached to a `HostedCluster` resource.

The API version policy generally aligns with the policy for link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/#api-versioning[Kubernetes API versioning].
