= Versioning for {hcp}

With each major, minor, or patch version release of {product-title}, two components of {hcp} are released:

* HyperShift Operator
* Command-line interface (CLI)

The HyperShift Operator manages the lifecycle of hosted clusters that are represented by `HostedCluster` API resources. The HyperShift Operator is released with each {product-title} release. After the HyperShift Operator is installed, it creates a config map called `supported-versions` in the HyperShift namespace, as shown in the following example. The config map describes the HostedCluster versions that can be deployed.

[source,yaml]
----
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      supported-versions: '{"versions":["4.14"]}'
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      labels:
        hypershift.openshift.io/supported-versions: "true"
      name: supported-versions
      namespace: hypershift
----

The CLI is a helper utility for development purposes. The CLI is released as part of any HyperShift Operator release. No compatibility policies are guaranteed.

The API, `hypershift.openshift.io`, provides a way to create and manage lightweight, flexible, heterogeneous {product-title} clusters at scale. The API exposes two user-facing resources: `HostedCluster` and `NodePool`. A `HostedCluster` resource encapsulates the control plane and common data plane configuration. When you create a `HostedCluster` resource, you have a fully functional control plane with no attached nodes. A `NodePool` resource is a scalable set of worker nodes that is attached to a `HostedCluster` resource.

The API version policy generally aligns with the policy for link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/#api-versioning[Kubernetes API versioning].
