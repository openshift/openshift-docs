= Versioning for {hcp}

The {hcp} feature includes the following components, which might require independent versioning and support levels:

* Management cluster
* HyperShift Operator
* {hcp-capital} (`hcp`) command-line interface (CLI)
* `hypershift.openshift.io` API
* Control Plane Operator

[id="hcp-versioning-mgmt_{context}"]
== Management cluster

In management clusters for production use, you need {mce}, which is available through the software catalog. The {mce-short} bundles a supported build of the HyperShift Operator. For your management clusters to remain supported, you must use the version of {product-title} that {mce-short} runs on. In general, a new release of {mce-short} runs on the following versions of {product-title}:

* The latest General Availability version of {product-title}
* Two versions before the latest General Availability version of {product-title}

The full list of {product-title} versions that you can install through the HyperShift Operator on a management cluster depends on the version of your HyperShift Operator. However, the list always includes at least the same {product-title} version as the management cluster and two previous minor versions relative to the management cluster. For example, if the management cluster is running 4.17 and a supported version of {mce-short}, the HyperShift Operator can install 4.17, 4.16, 4.15, and 4.14 hosted clusters.

With each major, minor, or patch version release of {product-title}, two components of {hcp} are released:

* The HyperShift Operator
* The `hcp` command-line interface (CLI)

[id="hcp-versioning-ho_{context}"]
== HyperShift Operator

The HyperShift Operator manages the lifecycle of hosted clusters that are represented by the `HostedCluster` API resources. The HyperShift Operator is released with each {product-title} release. The HyperShift Operator creates the `supported-versions` config map in the `hypershift` namespace. The config map contains the supported hosted cluster versions.

You can host different versions of control planes on the same management cluster.

[id="hcp-versioning-cli_{context}"]
== {hcp} CLI

You can use the `hcp` CLI to create hosted clusters. You can download the CLI from {mce-short}. When you run the `hcp version` command, the output shows the latest {product-title} that the CLI supports against your `kubeconfig` file.

[id="hcp-versioning-api_{context}"]
== hypershift.openshift.io API

You can use the `hypershift.openshift.io` API resources, such as, `HostedCluster` and `NodePool`, to create and manage {product-title} clusters at scale. A `HostedCluster` resource contains the control plane and common data plane configuration. When you create a `HostedCluster` resource, you have a fully functional control plane with no attached nodes. A `NodePool` resource is a scalable set of worker nodes that is attached to a `HostedCluster` resource.

The API version policy generally aligns with the policy for link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/#api-versioning[Kubernetes API versioning].

Updates for {hcp} involve updating the hosted cluster and the node pools. For more information, see "Updates for {hcp}".

[id="hcp-versioning-cpo_{context}"]
== Control Plane Operator

The Control Plane Operator is released as part of each {product-title} payload release image for the following architectures:

* amd64
* arm64
* multi-arch
