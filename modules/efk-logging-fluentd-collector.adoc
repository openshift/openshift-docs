= Selecting the logging collector

{product-title} cluster logging uses Fluentd by default. 
Log collectors are deployed as a Daemonset to each node in the cluster. 

You can change the logging collector to Rsyslog, if needed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
using Rsyslog as the logging collector is a Technology Preview feature.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to
upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide
feedback during the development process.

For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features support scope, see

+
----
$ oc get ClusterLogging
NAME       AGE
instance   112m
----

.Procedure

Edit the Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR) in the `openshift-logging` project: 

[source,yaml]
----
$ oc edit ClusterLogging instance

apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: "ClusterLogging"
metadata:
  name: "clusterlogging"
nodeSpec:
  image: openshift/origin-logging-elasticsearch5
  resources: {}

....

  collection: 
    logs:
      type: "fluentd" <1>
