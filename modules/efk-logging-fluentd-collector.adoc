= Selecting the logging collector

{product-title} cluster logging uses Fluentd by default. 
Log collectors are deployed as a DaemonSet to each node in the cluster. 

You can change the logging collector to Rsyslog, if needed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
using Rsyslog as the logging collector is a Technology Preview feature.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to
upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide
feedback during the development process.
