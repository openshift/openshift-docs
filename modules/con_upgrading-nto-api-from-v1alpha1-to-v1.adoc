= Upgrading Node Tuning Operator API from v1alpha1 to v1

[role="_abstract"]
Performance profiles are automatically converted from v1alpha1 to v1 API version on-the-fly using a conversion strategy when you upgrade the Node Tuning Operator.

When upgrading Node Tuning Operator API version from v1alpha1 to v1, the v1alpha1 performance profiles are converted on-the-fly using a "None" Conversion strategy and served to the Node Tuning Operator with API version v1.
