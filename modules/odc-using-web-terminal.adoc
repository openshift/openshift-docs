= Using the web terminal

After the Web Terminal Operator is installed, you can use the web terminal as follows:

. To launch the web terminal, click the command line terminal icon (image:odc-wto-icon.png[title="wto icon"]) on the upper right of the console. A web terminal instance is displayed in the *Command line terminal* pane. This instance is automatically logged in with your credentials.
. Select the project where the `DevWorkspace` CR must be created from the *Project* drop-down list. By default, the current project is selected.
+
[NOTE]
====
* The `DevWorkspace` CR is created only if it does not already exist.
* The `openshift-terminal` project is the default project used for cluster administrators. They do not have the option to choose another project.
====
+
. Click *Start* to initialize the web terminal using the selected project.
+
After the web terminal is initialized, you can use the preinstalled CLI tools like `oc`, `kubectl`, `odo`, `kn`, `tkn`, `helm`, `kubens`, `subctl`, and `kubectx` in the web terminal.
+
. Click *+* to open multiple tabs within web terminal in the console.
+
[NOTE]
====
* You can re-run commands by selecting them from the list of commands you have run in the terminal. These commands persist across multiple terminal sessions.

* The web terminal remains open until you close it or you close the browser window or tab.
