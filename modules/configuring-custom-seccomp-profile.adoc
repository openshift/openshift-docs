= Configuring a custom seccomp profile
You can configure a custom seccomp profile, which allows you to update the filters based on the application requirements. This allows cluster administrators to have greater control over the security of workloads running in OpenShift Container Platform.
[NOTE]
====
You can refer to the default seccomp profile to create a custom seccomp profile.

== Setting up the custom seccomp profile

.Prerequisite
* You have cluster administrator permissions.
* You have created a custom security context constraints (SCC). For more information, see "Additional resources".
* You have created a custom seccomp profile.

.Procedure
. Upload your custom seccomp profile to `/var/lib/kubelet/seccomp/<custom-name>.json` by using the Machine Config. See "Additional resources" for detailed steps.

. Update the custom SCC by providing reference to the created custom seccomp profile:
+
[source, yaml]
----
seccompProfiles:
- localhost/<custom-name>.json <1>
----
<1> Provide the name of your custom seccomp profile.



== Applying the custom seccomp profile to the workload

.Prerequisite
* The cluster administrator has set up the custom seccomp profile. For more details, see "Setting up the custom seccomp profile".

.Procedure
* Apply the seccomp profile to the workload by setting the `securityContext.seccompProfile.type` field as following:
+
.Example
+
[source, yaml]
----
spec:
  securityContext:
    seccompProfile:
      type: Localhost
      localhostProfile: <custom-name>.json <1>
----
<1> Provide the name of your custom seccomp profile.
+
Alternatively, you can use the pod annotations `seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod: localhost/<custom-name>.json`. This method is deprecated.
