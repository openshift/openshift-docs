= Helm chart support in the Operator SDK

The link:https://coreos.com/operators/[Operator Framework] is an open source
toolkit to manage Kubernetes native applications, called _Operators_, in an
effective, automated, and scalable way. This framework includes the Operator
SDK, which assists developers in bootstrapping and building an Operator based on
their expertise without requiring knowledge of Kubernetes API complexities.

One of the Operator SDK's options for generating an Operator project includes
leveraging an existing Helm chart to deploy Kubernetes resources as a unified
application, without having to write any Go code. Such Helm-based Operators are
designed to excel at stateless applications that require very little logic when
rolled out, because changes should be applied to the Kubernetes objects that are
generated as part of the chart. This may sound limiting, but can be sufficient
for a surprising amount of use-cases as shown by the proliferation of Helm
charts built by the Kubernetes community.

The main function of an Operator is to read from a custom object that represents
your application instance and have its desired state match what is running. In
the case of a Helm-based Operator, the object's spec field is a list of
configuration options that are typically described in Helm's `values.yaml` file.
Instead of setting these values with flags using the Helm CLI (for example, `helm install -f values.yaml`),
you can express them within a Custom Resource (CR), which, as a native
Kubernetes object, enables the benefits of RBAC applied to it and an audit
trail.

For an example of a simple CR called `Tomcat`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: Tomcat
metadata:
  name: example-app
spec:
  replicaCount: 2
----

The `replicaCount` value, `2` in this case, is propagated into the chart's
templates where following is used:

[source,yaml]
----
{{ .Values.replicaCount }}
----

After an Operator is built and deployed, you can deploy a new instance of an app
by creating a new instance of a CR, or list the different instances running in
all environments using the `oc` command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get Tomcats --all-namespaces
----

There is no requirement use the Helm CLI or install Tiller; Helm-based Operators
import code from the Helm project. All you have to do is have an instance of the
Operator running and register the CR with a Custom Resource Definition (CRD).
And because it obeys RBAC, you can more easily prevent production changes.
