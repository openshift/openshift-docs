= Creating {oci} infrastructure resources and services

You must create an {oci} environment on your virtual machine (VM) shape. By creating this environment, you can install {product-title} and deploy a cluster on an infrastructure that supports a wide range of cloud options and strong security policies. Having prior knowledge of {oci} components can help you with understanding the concept of {oci} resources and how you can configure them to meet your organizational needs.

The Agent-based installer method for installing an {product-title} cluster on {oci} requires that you manually create {oci} resources and services.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To ensure compatibility with {product-title}, you must set `A` as the record type for each DNS record and name records as follows:

* `api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, which targets the `apiVIP` parameter of the API load balancer.
* `api-int.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, which targets the `apiVIP` parameter of the API load balancer.
* `*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, which targets the `ingressVIP` parameter of the Ingress load balancer.

The `api.+*+` and `api-int.+*+` DNS records relate to control plane machines, so you must ensure that all nodes in your installed {product-title} cluster can access these DNS records.

.Prerequisites

* You configured an {oci} account to host the {product-title} cluster. See link:https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/openshift-on-oci/install-prereq.htm[Prerequisites (Oracle documentation)].

.Procedure

* Create the required {oci} resources and services. See link:https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/openshift-on-oci/agent-prereq.htm[{oci} Resources Needed for Using the Agent-based Installer (Oracle documentation)].
