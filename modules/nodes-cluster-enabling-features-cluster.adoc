= Enabling Technology Preview features using feature gates

You can turn on Technology Preview features on for all nodes in the cluster by
editing the Feature Gate Custom Resource, named `cluster`, in the `openshift-config` project.

The following Technology Preview features are enabled by feature gates:

* `ExperimentalCriticalPodAnnotation`

* `RotateKubeletServerCertificate`

* `SupportPodPidsLimit`

[IMPORTANT]
====
Turning on Technology Preview features using the Feature Gate Custom Resource cannot be undone and prevents upgrades.
