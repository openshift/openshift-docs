If your organization requires an integrated environment to develop, train, serve, test, and monitor AI/ML models and applications, consider {rhoai-full}.

{rhoai-full} is a platform for data scientists and developers of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) applications. {rhoai-full} builds on {product-title} and provides a preconfigured set of tools, accelerators, and other features to manage the full AI/ML lifecycle. This approach reduces the need to assemble and maintain individual Operators or components for AI workloads.

{rhoai-full} is available as an add-on cloud service to {product-rosa} or {product-dedicated}, or as a self-managed software product. It provides an AI platform with popular open source tooling for model serving and data science pipelines, integrated into a flexible UI.
