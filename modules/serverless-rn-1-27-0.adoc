= Release notes for Red Hat {ServerlessProductName} 1.27

{ServerlessProductName} 1.27 is now available. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {ServerlessProductName} on {product-title} are included in this topic.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{ServerlessProductName} 1.26 is the earliest release that is fully supported on {product-title} 4.12. {ServerlessProductName} 1.25 and older does not deploy on {product-title} 4.12.

For this reason, before upgrading {product-title} to version 4.12, first upgrade {ServerlessProductName} to version 1.26 or 1.27.

[id="new-features-1-27_{context}"]
== New features

* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Serving 1.6.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Eventing 1.6.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Kourier 1.6.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative (`kn`) CLI 1.6.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Kafka 1.6.
* The `kn func` CLI plug-in now uses `func` 1.8.1.

* Namespace-scoped brokers are now available as a Technology Preview. Such brokers can be used, for instance, to implement role-based access control (RBAC) policies.

* `KafkaSink` now uses the `CloudEvent` binary content mode by default. The binary content mode is more efficient than the structured mode because it uses headers in its body instead of a `CloudEvent`. For example, for the HTTP protocol, it uses HTTP headers.

* You can now use the gRPC framework over the HTTP/2 protocol for external traffic using the OpenShift Route on {product-title} 4.10 and later. This improves efficiency and speed of the communications between the client and server.

* API version `v1alpha1` of the Knative Operator Serving and Eventings CRDs is deprecated in 1.27. It will be removed in future versions. Red Hat strongly recommends to use the `v1beta1` version instead. This does not affect the existing installations, because CRDs are updated automatically when upgrading the Serverless Operator.

* The delivery timeout feature is now enabled by default. It allows you to specify the timeout for each sent HTTP request. The feature remains a Technology Preview.

[id="fixed-issues-1-27_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

* Previously, Knative services sometimes did not get into the `Ready` state, reporting waiting for the load balancer to be ready. This issue has been fixed.

[id="known-issues-1-27_{context}"]
== Known issues

* Integrating {ServerlessProductName} with {SMProductName} causes the `net-kourier` pod to run out of memory on startup when too many secrets are present on the cluster.

* Namespace-scoped brokers might leave `ClusterRoleBindings` in the user namespace even after deletion of namespace-scoped brokers.
+
If this happens, delete the `ClusterRoleBinding` named `rbac-proxy-reviews-prom-rb-knative-kafka-broker-data-plane-{{.Namespace}}` in the user namespace.

* If you use `net-istio` for Ingress and enable mTLS via SMCP using `security.dataPlane.mtls: true`, Service Mesh deploys `DestinationRules` for the `*.local` host, which does not allow `DomainMapping` for {ServerlessProductName}.
+
To work around this issue, enable mTLS by deploying `PeerAuthentication` instead of using `security.dataPlane.mtls: true`.
