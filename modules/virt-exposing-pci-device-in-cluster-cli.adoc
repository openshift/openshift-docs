[id="virt-exposing-pci-device-in-cluster-cli_{context}"]
= Exposing PCI host devices in the cluster using the CLI

[role="_abstract"]
To expose PCI host devices in the cluster, add details about the PCI devices to the `spec.permittedHostDevices.pciHostDevices` array of the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR).

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure
. Edit the `HyperConverged` CR in your default editor by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc edit hyperconverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n {CNVNamespace}
----

. Add the PCI device information to the `spec.permittedHostDevices.pciHostDevices` array.
+
Example configuration file:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: hco.kubevirt.io/v1
kind: HyperConverged
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
  namespace: {CNVNamespace}
spec:
  permittedHostDevices: <1>
    pciHostDevices: <2>
    - pciDeviceSelector: "10DE:1DB6" <3>
      resourceName: "nvidia.com/GV100GL_Tesla_V100" <4>
    - pciDeviceSelector: "10DE:1EB8"
      resourceName: "nvidia.com/TU104GL_Tesla_T4"
    - pciDeviceSelector: "8086:6F54"
      resourceName: "intel.com/qat"
      externalResourceProvider: true <5>
# ...
----
<1> The host devices that are permitted to be used in the cluster.
<2> The list of PCI devices available on the node.
<3> The `vendor-ID` and the `device-ID` required to identify the PCI device.
<4> The name of a PCI host device.
<5> Optional: Setting this field to `true` indicates that the resource is provided by an external device plugin. {VirtProductName} allows the usage of this device in the cluster but leaves the allocation and monitoring to an external device plugin.
+
[NOTE]
====
The above example snippet shows two PCI host devices that are named `nvidia.com/GV100GL_Tesla_V100` and `nvidia.com/TU104GL_Tesla_T4` added to the list of permitted host devices in the `HyperConverged` CR. These devices have been tested and verified to work with {VirtProductName}.
====

. Save your changes and exit the editor.

.Verification
* Verify that the PCI host devices were added to the node by running the following command. The example output shows that there is one device each associated with the `nvidia.com/GV100GL_Tesla_V100`, `nvidia.com/TU104GL_Tesla_T4`, and `intel.com/qat` resource names.
