|Name |Description
|Argo Rollouts controller |The Argo Rollouts Controller is an alternative to the standard `Deployment` resource and coexists alongside it. This controller only responds to changes in the Argo Rollouts resources and manages the `Rollout` custom resource (CR). The Argo Rollouts Controller does not modify standard deployment resources.
|AnalysisRun controller |The AnalysisRun controller manages `AnalysisRun` and `AnalysisTemplate` CRs and performs analysis for them. It connects a rollout to the metrics provider and defines thresholds for metrics that determine if a deployment update is successful for your application.
|`Experiment controller` | The `Experiment` controller runs analysis on short-lived replica sets and manages the `Experiment` custom resource. You can also integrate this controller with the `Rollout` resource by specifying the `experiment` step in the canary deployment `strategy` field.
|`Service` and `Ingress` controllers |The Service controller manages the `Service` resources and the Ingress controller manages the `Ingress` resources modified by Argo Rollouts. These controllers inject additional metadata annotations in the application instances for traffic management.
|Argo Rollouts CLI and UI |Argo Rollouts supports an `oc/kubectl` plugin called Argo Rollouts CLI. You can use it to interact with resources, such as rollouts, analyses, and experiments, from the command line. It can perform operations, such as `pause`, `promote`, or `retry`. The Argo Rollouts CLI plugin can start a local web UI dashboard in the browser to enhance the experience of visualizing the Argo Rollouts resources.
