= Integrate the 3scale adapter with {ProductName}

You can use these examples to configure requests to your services using the 3scale Istio Adapter.


.Prerequisites:

* {ProductName} 0.12.0+
* A working 3scale account (link:https://www.3scale.net/signup/[SaaS] or link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale_api_management/2.5/html/installing_3scale/onpremises-installation[3scale 2.5 On-Premises])
* xref:../service_mesh_install/preparing-ossm-installation.adoc#preparing-ossm-installation[{ProductName} prerequisites]
* Ensure Mixer policy enforcement is enabled. xref:../service_mesh_day_two/prepare-to-deploy-applications-ossm.adoc#ossm-mixer-policy_deploying-applications-ossm[Update Mixer policy enforcement] provides instructions to check the current Mixer policy enforcement status and enable policy enforcement.

[NOTE]
====
To configure the 3scale Istio Adapter, refer to xref:../service_mesh_install/customizing-installation-ossm.adoc#ossm-cr-parameters_customizing-installation-ossm[{ProductName} custom resources] for instructions on adding adapter parameters to the custom resource file.
====


[NOTE]
====
Pay particular attention to the `kind: handler` resource. You must update this with your 3scale credentials and the service ID of the API you want to manage.
====

. Modify the handler configuration with your 3scale configuration.
+
.Handler configuration example
[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
  kind: handler
  metadata:
   name: threescale
  spec:
   adapter: threescale
   params:
     service_id: "<SERVICE_ID>"
     system_url: "https://<organization>-admin.3scale.net/"
     access_token: "<ACCESS_TOKEN>"
   connection:
     address: "threescale-istio-adapter:3333"
----

Optionally, you can provide a `backend_url` field within the _params_ section to override the URL provided by the 3scale configuration. This may be useful if the adapter runs on the same cluster as the 3scale on-premise instance, and you wish to leverage the internal cluster DNS.

. Modify the rule configuration with your 3scale configuration to dispatch the rule to the threescale handler.
+
.Rule configuration example
[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
  kind: rule
  metadata:
    name: threescale
  spec:
    match: destination.labels["service-mesh.3scale.net"] == "true"
    actions:
      - handler: threescale.handler
        instances:
          - threescale-authorization.instance
