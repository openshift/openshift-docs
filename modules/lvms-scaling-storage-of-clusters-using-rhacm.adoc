[id="lvms-scaling-storage-of-clusters-using-rhacm_{context}"]
= Scaling up the storage of clusters by using {rh-rhacm}

You can scale up the storage capacity of worker nodes on the clusters by using {rh-rhacm}.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the {rh-rhacm} cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have created an `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR) by using {rh-rhacm}.
* You have additional unused devices on each cluster to be used by {lvms-first}.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {rh-rhacm} CLI using your {product-title} credentials.
. Edit the `LVMCluster` CR that you created using {rh-rhacm} by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit -f <file_name> -ns <namespace> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<file_name>` with the name of the `LVMCluster` CR.

. In the `LVMCluster` CR, add the path to the new device in the `deviceSelector` field.
+
.Example `LVMCluster` CR:

----
<1> Contains the configuration to specify the paths to the devices that you want to add to the LVM volume group.
You can specify the device paths in the `paths` field, the `optionalPaths` field, or both. If you do not specify the device paths in both `paths` and `optionalPaths`, {lvms-first} adds the supported unused devices to the LVM volume group. {lvms} adds the devices to the LVM volume group only if the following conditions are met:
* The device path exists.
* The device is supported by {lvms}. For information about unsupported devices, see "Devices not supported by {lvms}" in the "Additional resources" section.
<2> Specify the device paths. If the device path specified in this field does not exist, or the device is not supported by {lvms}, the `LVMCluster` CR moves to the `Failed` state.
<3> Specify the optional device paths. If the device path specified in this field does not exist, or the device is not supported by {lvms}, {lvms} ignores the device without causing an error. 
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
After a device is added to the LVM volume group, it cannot be removed.
====

. Save the `LVMCluster` CR.
