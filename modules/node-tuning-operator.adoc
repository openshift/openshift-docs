= About the Node Tuning Operator

The Node Tuning Operator helps you manage node-level tuning by orchestrating the
tuned daemon. The majority of high-performance applications require some level of
kernel tuning. The Node Tuning Operator provides a unified management interface
to users of node-level sysctls and more flexibility to add custom tuning
specified by user needs. The Operator
manages the containerized tuned daemon for {product-title} as a Kubernetes
DaemonSet. It ensures the custom tuning specification is passed to all
containerized tuned daemons running in the cluster in the format that the
daemons understand. The daemons run on all nodes in the cluster, one per node.

Node-level settings applied by the containerized tuned are rolled back on
an event that triggers a profile change or when the containerized tuned
daemon is terminated gracefully by receiving and handling a termination
signal.

The Node Tuning Operator is part of a standard {product-title} installation in
version 4.1 and later.
