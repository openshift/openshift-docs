== Purpose
endif::operators[]
The Node Tuning Operator helps you manage node-level tuning by orchestrating the
tuned daemon. The majority of high-performance applications require some level
of kernel tuning. The Node Tuning Operator provides a unified management
interface to users of node-level sysctls and more flexibility to add custom
tuning specified by user needs. The Operator manages the containerized tuned
daemon for {product-title} as a Kubernetes DaemonSet. It ensures the custom
tuning specification is passed to all containerized tuned daemons running in the
cluster in the format that the daemons understand. The daemons run on all nodes
in the cluster, one per node.

Node-level settings applied by the containerized tuned daemon are rolled back on
an event that triggers a profile change or when the containerized tuned daemon
is terminated gracefully by receiving and handling a termination signal.

The Node Tuning Operator is part of a standard {product-title} installation in
version 4.1 and later.
