= Rebooting a node gracefully

Before rebooting a node, it is recommended to backup etcd data to avoid any data loss on the node.

.Procedure

To perform a graceful restart of a node:

. Mark the node as unschedulable:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm cordon <node1>
----

. Drain the node to remove all the running pods:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm drain <node1> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-local-data
----
+
You might receive errors that pods associated with custom pod disruption budgets (PDB) cannot be evicted.
+
.Example error
[source,terminal]
----
error when evicting pods/"rails-postgresql-example-1-72v2w" -n "rails" (will retry after 5s): Cannot evict pod as it would violate the pod's disruption budget.
----
+
In this case, run the drain command again, adding the `disable-eviction` flag, which bypasses the PDB checks:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm drain <node1> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data --force --disable-eviction 
----

. Access the node in debug mode:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<node1>
----

. Change your root directory to the host:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ chroot /host
----

. Restart the node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ systemctl reboot
----
+
In a moment, the node enters the `NotReady` state.

. After the reboot is complete, mark the node as schedulable by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm uncordon <node1>
----

. Verify that the node is ready:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get node <node1>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME    STATUS  ROLES    AGE     VERSION
<node1> Ready   worker   6d22h   v1.18.3+b0068a8
