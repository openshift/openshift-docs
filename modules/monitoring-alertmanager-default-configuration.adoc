= Alertmanager default configuration

The default configuration of the {product-title} Monitoring Alertmanager cluster is this:

[source,yaml]
----
global:
  resolve_timeout: 5m
route:
  group_wait: 30s
  group_interval: 5m
  repeat_interval: 12h
  receiver: default
  routes:
  - match:
      alertname: Watchdog
    repeat_interval: 5m
    receiver: watchdog
receivers:
- name: default
- name: watchdog
----

{product-title} monitoring ships with the Watchdog alert that always triggers by default to ensure the availability of the monitoring infrastructure.

// FIXME perhaps explain what individual entries in the listing mean
