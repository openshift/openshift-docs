= Removing unused rendered machine configs

You can remove unused rendered machine configs by using the `oc adm prune renderedmachineconfigs` command with the `--confirm` command.  If any rendered machine config is not deleted, the command output indicates which was not deleted and lists the reason for skipping the deletion.

.Procedure

. Optional: List the rendered machine configs that you can remove automatically by running the following command. Any rendered machine config marked with the `as it's currently in use` message in the command output cannot be removed.

. Remove the unused rendered machine configs by running the following command. The command in the following procedure would delete the two oldest unused rendered machine configs in the `worker` machine config pool.

where:

`--count`:: Optional: Specifies the maximum number of unused rendered machine configs you want to delete, starting with the oldest.

`--confirm`:: Optional: Indicate that pruning should occur, instead of performing a dry-run.

`--pool-name`:: Optional: Specifies the machine config pool from which you want to delete the machine. If not specified, all the pools are evaluated.
