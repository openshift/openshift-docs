= Relationship of build run with Tekton tasks

[role="_abstract"]
Assign image building to Tekton `TaskRun` resources that execute strategy-defined steps.

The BuildRun resource assigns the task of image construction to a Tekton `TaskRun`, which executes all steps until either completion or failure.

During build run reconciliation, the build run controller generates a new `TaskRun` resource and embeds the steps required for the build run execution. These embedded steps are defined in your build strategy.
