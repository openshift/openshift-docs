= Relationship of build run with Tekton tasks

[role="_abstract"] 

The `BuildRun` resource delegates the task of image construction to the Tekton `TaskRun` resource, which runs all steps until either the completion of the task, or a failure occurs in the task.

During the build run reconciliation, the build run controller generates a new `TaskRun` resource. The controller embeds the required steps for a build run execution in the `TaskRun` resource. The embedded steps are defined in your build strategy.
