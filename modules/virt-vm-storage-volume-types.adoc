= Virtual machine storage volume types

Virtual machine storage volume types are listed, as well as domain and volume settings. See the
https://kubevirt.io/api-reference/master/definitions.html#_v1_virtualmachinespec[kubevirt
API Reference] for a definitive list of virtual machine settings.

[horizontal]
*ephemeral*::
A local copy-on-write (COW) image that uses a network volume as a
read-only backing store. The backing volume
must be a *PersistentVolumeClaim*. The ephemeral image is created when
the virtual machine starts and stores all writes locally. The ephemeral
image is discarded when the virtual machine is stopped, restarted, or
deleted. The backing volume (PVC) is not mutated in any way.

*persistentVolumeClaim*::
Attaches an available PV to a virtual machine. Attaching a PV allows for the
virtual machine data to persist between sessions.
+
Importing an existing virtual machine disk into a PVC by using
CDI and attaching the PVC to a virtual machine instance is the
recommended method for importing existing virtual machines into
{product-title}. There are some requirements for the disk to be used within a
PVC.

*dataVolume*::
DataVolumes build on the *persistentVolumeClaim* disk type by managing the process
of preparing the virtual machine disk via an import, clone, or upload operation.
VMs that use this volume type are guaranteed not to start until the volume is ready.

*cloudInitNoCloud*::
Attaches a disk that contains the referenced cloud-init NoCloud data
source, providing user data and metadata to the virtual machine.
A cloud-init installation is required inside the virtual machine
disk.

*containerDisk*::
References an image, such as a virtual machine disk, that is stored in
the container image registry. The image is pulled from the registry and
embedded in a volume when the virtual machine is created. A
*containerDisk* volume is ephemeral. It is discarded when
the virtual machine is stopped, restarted, or deleted.
+
Container disks are not limited to a single virtual machine and are
useful for creating large numbers of virtual machine clones that do not
require persistent storage.
+
Only RAW and QCOW2 formats are supported disk types for the container
image registry. QCOW2 is recommended for reduced image size.

*emptyDisk*::
Creates an additional sparse QCOW2 disk that is tied to the life-cycle
of the virtual machine interface. The data survives guest-initiated
reboots in the virtual machine but is discarded when the virtual machine
stops or is restarted from the web console. The empty disk is used to
store application dependencies and data that otherwise exceeds the
limited temporary file system of an ephemeral disk.
+
The disk *capacity* size must also be provided.
