Feature – Describe the new functionality available to the customer.  For enhancements, try to describe as specifically as possible where the customer will see changes.
Reason – If known, include why has the enhancement been implemented (use case, performance, technology, etc.).   For example, showcases integration of X with Y, demonstrates Z API feature, includes latest framework bug fixes.  There may not have been a 'problem' previously, but system behaviour may have changed.
Result – If changed, describe the current user experience

{ProductName} provides a number of key capabilities uniformly across a network of services:

* *Traffic Management* - Control the flow of traffic and API calls between services, make calls more reliable, and make the network more robust in the face of adverse conditions.
* *Service Identity and Security* - Provide services in the mesh with a verifiable identity and provide the ability to protect service traffic as it flows over networks of varying degrees of trustworthiness.
* *Policy Enforcement* - Apply organizational policy to the interaction between services, ensure access policies are enforced and resources are fairly distributed among consumers. Policy changes are made by configuring the mesh, not by changing application code.
* *Telemetry* -  Gain understanding of the dependencies between services and the nature and flow of traffic between them, providing the ability to quickly identify issues.

== New features {ProductName} 2.0

This release of {ProductName} adds support for Istio 1.6.5, Jaeger 1.20.0, Kiali 1.24.2, and the 3scale Istio Adapter 2.0 and OpenShift Container Platform 4.6.

In addition, this release has the following new features:

* Introduces a re-architected control plane.  The Mixer component has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  The other control plane components, Pilot, Galley, Citadel, have been combined into a single binary known as Istiod. The "d" stands for daemon.
** Simplifies installation, upgrades, and management of the control plane.
** Reduces the control plane's resource usage and startup time.
** Improves performance by reducing inter-control plane communication over networking.

* Adds support for Envoy's Secret Discovery Service (SDS). SDS is a more secure and efficient mechanism for delivering secrets to Envoy side car proxies.
** Removes the need to use Kubernetes Secrets, which have well known security risks.
** Improves performance during certificate rotation, as proxies no longer require a restart to recognize new certificates.
** Enables integration with 3rd party certificate managers, such as Vault and Spire.

* Adds support for Istio's Telemetry v2 architecture, which is built using WebAssembly extensions. This new architecture brings significant performance improvements.

* Updates the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource to v2 with a streamlined configuration to make it easier to manage the Control Plane.

* Introduces WebAssembly extensions as a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview] feature.
