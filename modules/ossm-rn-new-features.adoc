include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

This release makes the {SMProductName} Operator available on ARM-based clusters as a Technology Preview feature. Images are available for Istio, Envoy, Prometheus, Kiali, and Grafana. Images are not available for Jaeger, so Jaeger must be disabled as a {SMProductShortName} add-on.

=== Remote Procedure Calls (gRPC) API support for external authorization configuration

This enhancement adds the `envoyExtAuthzGrpc` field to configure an external authorization provider using the gRPC API.

=== Cluster-wide deployments
This enhancement introduces a generally available version of cluster-wide deployments. A cluster-wide deployment contains a service mesh control plane that monitors resources for an entire cluster. The control plane uses a single query across all namespaces to monitor each Istio or Kubernetes resource that affects the mesh configuration. Reducing the number of queries the control plane performs in a cluster-wide deployment improves performance.

=== Support for discovery selectors
This enhancement introduces a generally available version of the `meshConfig.discoverySelectors` field, which can be used in cluster-wide deployments to limit the services the service mesh control plane can discover.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  meshConfig
    discoverySelectors:
    - matchLabels:
        env: prod
        region: us-east1
    - matchExpressions:
      - key: app
        operator: In
        values:
          - cassandra
          - spark
----

=== Integration with cert-manager istio-csr
With this update, {SMProductName} integrates with the `cert-manager` controller and the `istio-csr` agent. `cert-manager` adds certificates and certificate issuers as resource types in Kubernetes clusters, and simplifies the process of obtaining, renewing, and using those certificates. `cert-manager` provides and rotates an intermediate CA certificate for Istio. Integration with `istio-csr` enables users to delegate signing certificate requests from Istio proxies to `cert-manager`. `ServiceMeshControlPlane` v2.4 accepts CA certificates provided by `cert-manager` as `cacerts` secret.

[NOTE]
====
Integration with `cert-manager` and `istio-csr` is not supported on {ibm-power-name}, {ibm-z-name}, and {ibm-linuxone-name}.
====

=== Integration with external authorization systems
This enhancement introduces a generally available method of integrating {SMProductName} with external authorization systems by using the `action: CUSTOM` field of the `AuthorizationPolicy` resource. Use the `envoyExtAuthzHttp` field to delegate the access control to an external authorization system.

=== Integration with external Prometheus installation

This enhancement introduces a generally available version of the Prometheus extension provider. You can expose metrics to the {product-title} monitoring stack or a custom Prometheus installation by setting the value of the `extensionProviders` field to `prometheus` in the `spec.meshConfig` specification. The telemetry object configures Istio proxies to collect traffic metrics. {SMProductShortName} only supports the Telemetry API for Prometheus metrics.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  meshConfig:
    extensionProviders:
    - name: prometheus
      prometheus: {}
---
apiVersion: telemetry.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: Telemetry
metadata:
  name: enable-prometheus-metrics
spec:
  metrics:
  - providers:
    - name: prometheus
----

=== Single stack IPv6 support

This enhancement introduces generally available support for single stack IPv6 clusters, providing access to a broader range of IP addresses. Dual stack IPv4 or IPv6 cluster is not supported.

[NOTE]
====
Single stack IPv6 support is not available on {ibm-power-name}, {ibm-z-name}, and {ibm-linuxone-name}.
====

=== {product-title} Gateway API support
:FeatureName: {product-title} Gateway API support
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

This enhancement introduces an updated Technology Preview version of the {product-title} Gateway API. By default, the {product-title} Gateway API is disabled.

==== Enabling {product-title} Gateway API
To enable the {product-title} Gateway API, set the value of the `enabled` field to `true` in the `techPreview.gatewayAPI` specification of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  techPreview:
    gatewayAPI:
      enabled: true
----

Previously, environment variables were used to enable the Gateway API.

=== New Container Network Interface (CNI) DaemonSet container and ConfigMap

The `openshift-operators` namespace includes a new istio CNI DaemonSet `istio-cni-node-v2-3` and a new `ConfigMap` resource, `istio-cni-config-v2-3`.

When upgrading to Service Mesh Control Plane 2.3, the existing `istio-cni-node` DaemonSet is not changed, and a new `istio-cni-node-v2-3` DaemonSet is created.

This name change does not affect previous releases or any `istio-cni-node` CNI DaemonSet associated with a Service Mesh Control Plane deployed using a previous release.

=== Gateway injection support

This release introduces generally available support for Gateway injection. Gateway configurations are applied to standalone Envoy proxies that are running at the edge of the mesh, rather than the sidecar Envoy proxies running alongside your service workloads. This enables the ability to customize gateway options. When using gateway injection, you must create the following resources in the namespace where you want to run your gateway proxy: `Service`, `Deployment`, `Role`, and `RoleBinding`.

=== Istio 1.14 Support

{SMProductShortName} 2.3 is based on Istio 1.14, which brings in new features and product enhancements. While many Istio 1.14 features are supported, the following exceptions should be noted:

* ProxyConfig API is supported with the exception of the image field.
* Telemetry API is a Technology Preview feature.
* SPIRE runtime is not a supported feature.

=== OpenShift Service Mesh Console
:FeatureName: OpenShift Service Mesh Console
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

This release introduces a Technology Preview version of the {product-title} Service Mesh Console, which integrates the Kiali interface directly into the OpenShift web console. For additional information, see link:https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/introducing-the-openshift-service-mesh-console-a-developer-preview[Introducing the OpenShift Service Mesh Console (A Technology Preview)]

===  Cluster-wide deployment
:FeatureName: Cluster-wide deployment
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

This release introduces cluster-wide deployment as a Technology Preview feature. A cluster-wide deployment contains a Service Mesh Control Plane that monitors resources for an entire cluster. The control plane uses a single query across all namespaces to monitor each Istio or Kubernetes resource kind that affects the mesh configuration. In contrast, the multitenant approach uses a query per namespace for each resource kind. Reducing the number of queries the control plane performs in a cluster-wide deployment improves performance.

[NOTE]
====
This cluster-wide deployment documentation is only applicable for control planes deployed using SMCP v2.3. cluster-wide deployments created using SMCP v2.3 are not compatible with cluster-wide deployments created using SMCP v2.4.
====

==== Configuring cluster-wide deployment

The following example `ServiceMeshControlPlane` object configures a cluster-wide deployment.

To create an SMCP for cluster-wide deployment, a user must belong to the `cluster-admin` ClusterRole. If the SMCP is configured for cluster-wide deployment, it must be the only SMCP in the cluster. You cannot change the control plane mode from multitenant to cluster-wide (or from cluster-wide to multitenant). If a multitenant control plane already exists, delete it and create a new one.

This example configures the SMCP for cluster-wide deployment.

Kubernetes Gateway API is a technology preview feature that is disabled by default. If the Kubernetes API deployment controller is disabled, you must manually deploy and link an ingress gateway to the created Gateway object.

If the Kubernetes API deployment controller is enabled, then an ingress gateway automatically deploys when a Gateway object is created.

==== Installing the Gateway API CRDs
The Gateway API CRDs do not come preinstalled by default on OpenShift clusters. Install the CRDs prior to enabling Gateway API support in the SMCP.

[source,terminal]
----
$ kubectl get crd gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io || { kubectl kustomize "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/config/crd?ref=v0.4.0" | kubectl apply -f -; }
----

==== Enabling Kubernetes Gateway API
To enable the feature, set the following environment variables for the `Istiod` container in `ServiceMeshControlPlane`:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  runtime:
    components:
      pilot:
        container:
          env:
            PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API: "true"
            PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_STATUS: "true"
            # and optionally, for the deployment controller
            PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER: "true"
----
Restricting route attachment on Gateway API listeners is possible using the `SameNamespace` or `All` settings. Istio ignores usage of label selectors in `listeners.allowedRoutes.namespaces` and reverts to the default behavior (`SameNamespace`).

==== Manually linking an existing gateway to a Gateway resource
If the Kubernetes API deployment controller is disabled, you must manually deploy and then link an ingress gateway to the created Gateway resource.

=== Disabling network policies

{SMProductName} automatically creates and manages a number of `NetworkPolicies` resources in the {SMProductShortName} control plane and application namespaces. This is to ensure that applications and the control plane can communicate with each other.

If you want to disable the automatic creation and management of `NetworkPolicies` resources, for example to enforce company security policies, you can do so.  You can edit the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` to set the `spec.security.manageNetworkPolicy` setting to `false`

[NOTE]
====
When you disable `spec.security.manageNetworkPolicy` {SMProductName} will not create *any* `NetworkPolicy` objects.  The system administrator is responsible for managing the network and fixing any issues this might cause.
====

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Select the project where you installed the {SMProductShortName} control plane, for example `istio-system`, from the Project menu.

. Click the {SMProductName} Operator. In the *Istio Service Mesh Control Plane* column, click the name of your `ServiceMeshControlPlane`, for example `basic-install`.

. On the *Create ServiceMeshControlPlane Details* page, click `YAML` to modify your configuration.

. Set the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` field `spec.security.manageNetworkPolicy` to `false`, as shown in this example.

=== Service Mesh Federation

New Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) have been added to support federating service meshes. Service meshes may be federated both within the same cluster or across different OpenShift clusters. These new resources include:

* `ServiceMeshPeer` - Defines a federation with a separate service mesh, including gateway configuration, root trust certificate configuration, and status fields. In a pair of federated meshes, each mesh will define its own separate `ServiceMeshPeer` resource.

* `ExportedServiceMeshSet` - Defines which services for a given `ServiceMeshPeer` are available for the peer mesh to import.

* `ImportedServiceSet` - Defines which services for a given `ServiceMeshPeer` are imported from the peer mesh. These services must also be made available by the peer’s `ExportedServiceMeshSet` resource.

ifndef::openshift-rosa[]
Service Mesh Federation is not supported between clusters on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA), Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO), or OpenShift Dedicated (OSD).

=== OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) generally available

The OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) was previously introduced as a Technology Preview feature in {SMProductName} 2.0.1 and is now generally available in {SMProductName} 2.1 and 2.0.x for use on {product-title} 4.7.32, {product-title} 4.8.12, and {product-title} 4.9.

=== Service Mesh WebAssembly (WASM) Extensions

The `ServiceMeshExtensions` Custom Resource Definition (CRD), first introduced in 2.0 as Technology Preview, is now generally available. You can use CRD to build your own plugins, but Red Hat does not provide support for the plugins you create.

Mixer has been completely removed in Service Mesh 2.1. Upgrading from a Service Mesh 2.0.x release to 2.1 will be blocked if Mixer is enabled. Mixer plugins will need to be ported to WebAssembly Extensions.

=== 3scale WebAssembly Adapter (WASM)

With Mixer now officially removed, OpenShift Service Mesh 2.1 does not support the 3scale mixer adapter. Before upgrading to Service Mesh 2.1, remove the Mixer-based 3scale adapter and any additional Mixer plugins. Then, manually install and configure the new 3scale WebAssembly adapter with Service Mesh 2.1+ using a `ServiceMeshExtension` resource.

3scale 2.11 introduces an updated Service Mesh integration based on  `WebAssembly`.

=== Istio 1.9 Support

{SMProductShortName} 2.1 is based on Istio 1.9, which brings in a large number of new features and product enhancements. While the majority of Istio 1.9 features are supported, the following exceptions should be noted:

* Virtual Machine integration is not yet supported
* Kubernetes Gateway API is not yet supported
* Remote fetch and load of WebAssembly HTTP filters are not yet supported
* Custom CA Integration using the Kubernetes CSR API is not yet supported
* Request Classification for monitoring traffic is a tech preview feature
* Integration with external authorization systems via Authorization policy’s CUSTOM action is a tech preview feature

=== Improved Service Mesh operator performance

The amount of time {SMProductName} uses to prune old resources at the end of every `ServiceMeshControlPlane` reconciliation has been reduced. This results in faster `ServiceMeshControlPlane` deployments, and allows changes applied to existing SMCPs to take effect more quickly.


=== Kiali updates

Kiali 1.36 includes the following features and enhancements:

* {SMProductShortName} troubleshooting functionality
** Control plane and gateway monitoring
** Proxy sync statuses
** Envoy configuration views
** Unified view showing Envoy proxy and application logs interleaved
* Namespace and cluster boxing to support federated service mesh views
* New validations, wizards, and distributed tracing enhancements

=== Change in how {SMProductName} handles URI fragments

{SMProductName} contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability, link:https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-39156[CVE-2021-39156], where an HTTP request with a fragment (a section in the end of a URI that begins with a # character) in the URI path could bypass the Istio URI path-based authorization policies. For instance, an Istio authorization policy denies requests sent to the URI path `/user/profile`. In the vulnerable versions, a request with URI path `/user/profile#section1` bypasses the deny policy and routes to the backend (with the normalized URI `path /user/profile%23section1`), possibly leading to a security incident.

You are impacted by this vulnerability if you use authorization policies with DENY actions and `operation.paths`, or ALLOW actions and `operation.notPaths`.

With the mitigation, the fragment part of the request’s URI is removed before the authorization and routing. This prevents a request with a fragment in its URI from bypassing authorization policies which are based on the URI without the fragment part.

To opt-out from the new behavior in the mitigation, the fragment section in the URI will be kept. You can configure your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` to keep URI fragments.

[WARNING]
====
Disabling the new behavior will normalize your paths as described above and is considered unsafe. Ensure that you have accommodated for this in any security policies before opting to keep URI fragments.

=== Required update for authorization policies

Istio generates hostnames for both the hostname itself and all matching ports. For instance, a virtual service or Gateway for a host of "httpbin.foo" generates a config matching "httpbin.foo and httpbin.foo:*". However, exact match authorization policies only match the exact string given for the `hosts` or `notHosts` fields.

Your cluster is impacted if you have `AuthorizationPolicy` resources using exact string comparison for the rule to determine link:https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/security/authorization-policy/#Operation[hosts or notHosts].

You must update your authorization policy link:https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/security/authorization-policy/#Rule[rules] to use prefix match instead of exact match.  For example, replacing `hosts: ["httpbin.com"]` with `hosts: ["httpbin.com:*"]` in the first `AuthorizationPolicy` example.

[IMPORTANT]
====
There are manual steps that must be completed to address CVE-2021-29492 and CVE-2021-31920.
====

[id="manual-updates-cve-2021-29492_{context}"]
=== Manual updates required by CVE-2021-29492 and CVE-2021-31920

Istio contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an HTTP request path with multiple slashes or escaped slash characters (`%2F` or `%5C`) could potentially bypass an Istio authorization policy when path-based authorization rules are used.

For example, assume an Istio cluster administrator defines an authorization DENY policy to reject the request at path `/admin`. A request sent to the URL path `//admin` will NOT be rejected by the authorization policy.

According to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-6[RFC 3986], the path `//admin` with multiple slashes should technically be treated as a different path from the `/admin`. However, some backend services choose to normalize the URL paths by merging multiple slashes into a single slash. This can result in a bypass of the authorization policy (`//admin` does not match `/admin`), and a user can access the resource at path `/admin` in the backend; this would represent a security incident.

Your cluster is impacted by this vulnerability if you have authorization policies using `ALLOW action + notPaths` field or `DENY action + paths field` patterns. These patterns are vulnerable to unexpected policy bypasses.

Your cluster is NOT impacted by this vulnerability if:

* You don’t have authorization policies.
* Your authorization policies don’t define `paths` or `notPaths` fields.
* Your authorization policies use `ALLOW action + paths` field or `DENY action + notPaths` field patterns. These patterns could only cause unexpected rejection instead of policy bypasses. The upgrade is optional for these cases.

[NOTE]
====
The {SMProductName} configuration location for path normalization is different from the Istio configuration.
====

=== Updating the path normalization configuration

Istio authorization policies can be based on the URL paths in the HTTP request.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_normalization[Path normalization], also known as URI normalization, modifies and standardizes the incoming requests' paths so that the normalized paths can be processed in a standard way.
Syntactically different paths may be equivalent after path normalization.

Istio supports the following normalization schemes on the request paths before evaluating against the authorization policies and routing the requests:

.Normalization schemes
[options="header"]
[cols="a, a, a, a"]
|====
| Option | Description | Example |Notes
|`NONE`
|No normalization is done. Anything received by Envoy will be forwarded exactly as-is to any backend service.
|`../%2Fa../b` is evaluated by the authorization policies and sent to your service.
|This setting is vulnerable to CVE-2021-31920.

|`BASE`
|This is currently the option used in the *default* installation of Istio. This applies the https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/network/http_connection_manager/v3/http_connection_manager.proto#envoy-v3-api-field-extensions-filters-network-http-connection-manager-v3-httpconnectionmanager-normalize-path[`normalize_path`] option on Envoy proxies, which follows https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986[RFC 3986] with extra normalization to convert backslashes to forward slashes.
|`/a/../b` is normalized to `/b`. `\da` is normalized to `/da`.
|This setting is vulnerable to CVE-2021-31920.

| `MERGE_SLASHES`
| Slashes are merged after the _BASE_ normalization.
| `/a//b` is normalized to `/a/b`.
|Update to this setting to mitigate CVE-2021-31920.

|`DECODE_AND_MERGE_SLASHES`
|The strictest setting when you allow all traffic by default. This setting is recommended, with the caveat that you must thoroughly test your authorization policies routes. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1[Percent-encoded] slash and backslash characters (`%2F`, `%2f`, `%5C` and `%5c`) are decoded to `/` or `\`, before the `MERGE_SLASHES` normalization.
|`/a%2fb` is normalized to `/a/b`.
|Update to this setting to mitigate CVE-2021-31920. This setting is more secure, but also has the potential to break applications. Test your applications before deploying to production.
|====

The normalization algorithms are conducted in the following order:

. Percent-decode `%2F`, `%2f`, `%5C` and `%5c`.
. The https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986[RFC 3986] and other normalization implemented by the https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/network/http_connection_manager/v3/http_connection_manager.proto#envoy-v3-api-field-extensions-filters-network-http-connection-manager-v3-httpconnectionmanager-normalize-path[`normalize_path`] option in Envoy.
. Merge slashes.

[WARNING]
====
While these normalization options represent recommendations from HTTP standards and common industry practices, applications may interpret a URL in any way it chooses to. When using denial policies, ensure that you understand how your application behaves.
====

=== Path normalization configuration examples

Ensuring Envoy normalizes request paths to match your backend services' expectations is critical to the security of your system.
The following examples can be used as a reference for you to configure your system.
The normalized URL paths, or the original URL paths if `NONE` is selected, will be:

. Used to check against the authorization policies.
. Forwarded to the backend application.

.Configuration examples
[options="header"]
[cols="a, a"]
|====
|If your application... |Choose...
|Relies on the proxy to do normalization
|`BASE`, `MERGE_SLASHES` or `DECODE_AND_MERGE_SLASHES`

|Normalizes request paths based on https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986[RFC 3986] and does not merge slashes.
|`BASE`

|Normalizes request paths based on https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986[RFC 3986] and merges slashes, but does not decode https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1[percent-encoded] slashes.
|`MERGE_SLASHES`

|Normalizes request paths based on https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986[RFC 3986], decodes https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1[percent-encoded] slashes, and merges slashes.
|`DECODE_AND_MERGE_SLASHES`

|Processes request paths in a way that is incompatible with https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986[RFC 3986].
|`NONE`
|====

=== Configuring your SMCP for path normalization

To configure path normalization for {SMProductName}, specify the following in your `ServiceMeshControlPlane`. Use the configuration examples to help determine the settings for your system.

.SMCP v2 pathNormalization
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  techPreview:
    global:
      pathNormalization: <option>
----

=== Configuring for case normalization

In some environments, it may be useful to have paths in authorization policies compared in a case insensitive manner.
For example, treating `https://myurl/get` and `https://myurl/GeT` as equivalent.
In those cases, you can use the `EnvoyFilter` shown below.
This filter will change both the path used for comparison and the path presented to the application. In this example, `istio-system` is the name of the {SMProductShortName} control plane project.

Save the `EnvoyFilter` to a file and run the following command:

[source,terminal]

* Adds support for Envoy's Secret Discovery Service (SDS). SDS is a more secure and efficient mechanism for delivering secrets to Envoy side car proxies.
** Removes the need to use Kubernetes Secrets, which have well known security risks.
** Improves performance during certificate rotation, as proxies no longer require a restart to recognize new certificates.

* Adds support for Istio's Telemetry v2 architecture, which is built using WebAssembly extensions. This new architecture brings significant performance improvements.

* Updates the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource to v2 with a streamlined configuration to make it easier to manage the {SMProductShortName} Control Plane.
