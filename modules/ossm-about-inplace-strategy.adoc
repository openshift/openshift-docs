= About InPlace strategy

The `InPlace` update strategy runs only one revision of the control plane at a time. During an update, all the workloads immediately connect to the new control plane version. To maintain compatibility between the sidecars and the control plane, you can upgrade only one minor version at a time.

The `InPlace` strategy updates and restarts the existing {istio} control plane in place. During this process, only one instance of the control plane exists, eliminating the need to move workloads to a new control plane instance. To complete the update, restart the application workloads and gateways to refresh the Envoy proxies.

While the `InPlace` strategy offers simplicity and efficiency, there's a slight possibility of application traffic interruption if a workload pod updates, restarts, or scales while the control plane is restarting. You can mitigate this risk by running multiple replicas of the {istio} control plane (istiod).
