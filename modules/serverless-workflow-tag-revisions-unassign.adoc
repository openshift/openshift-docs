[id="unassigning-tag-revisions_{context}"]
= Unassigning tag revisions

Tags assigned to revisions in a traffic block can be unassigned. Unassigning tags removes the custom URLs.

[NOTE]
====
If a revision is untagged and it is assigned 0% of the traffic, it is removed from the traffic block entirely.
====

.Procedure
* A user can unassign the tags for revisions using the `kn service update` command:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ kn service update svc --untag candidate
----

[NOTE]
====
`--untag Tag` uses the following syntax:

* The `--untag` flag requires one value.
* The `tag` string denotes the unique tag in the traffic block of the service which needs to be unassigned. This also removes the respective custom URL.
* The `--untag` flag can be specified multiple times.
