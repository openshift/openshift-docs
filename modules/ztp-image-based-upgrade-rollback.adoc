= (Optional) Initiating rollback of the {sno} cluster after an image-based upgrade

You can manually roll back the changes if you encounter unresolvable issues after an upgrade.

By default, an automatic rollback is initiated on the following conditions:

* If the reconfiguration of the cluster fails upon the first reboot.
* If the {lcao} reports a failed upgrade upon completing the process.
* If the upgrade does not complete within the time frame specified in the `initMonitorTimeoutSeconds` field after rebooting.

You can disable the automatic rollback configuration in the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR at the `Prep` stage:

.Example ImageBasedUpgrade CR
[source,yaml]

apiVersion: lca.openshift.io/v1alpha1

<1> By default, automatic rollback on failure is enabled throughout the upgrade.
<2> (Optional) If set to `true`, this option disables automatic rollback when the reconfiguration of the cluster fails upon the first reboot.
<3> (Optional) If set to `true`, this option disables automatic rollback after the {lcao} reports a failed upgrade upon completion.
<4> (Optional) If set to `true`, this option disables automatic rollback when the upgrade does not complete within the time frame specified in the `initMonitorTimeoutSeconds` field after reboot.
<5> Specifies the time frame in seconds. If not defined or set to `0`, the default value of `1800` seconds (30 minutes) is used.

.Prerequisites

* Log in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Move to the rollback stage by changing the value of the `stage` field to `Rollback` in the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch imagebasedupgrades.lca.openshift.io example-upgrade -p='{"spec": {"stage": "Rollback"}}' --type=merge
----

. The {lcao} reboots the cluster with the previously installed version of {product-title} and restores the applications.

. Commit to the rollback by changing the value of the `stage` field to `Idle` in the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch imagebasedupgrades.lca.openshift.io example-upgrade -p='{"spec": {"stage": "Idle"}}' --type=merge -n openshift-lifecycle-agent
----

[WARNING]
====
If you move to the `Idle` stage after a rollback, the {lcao} cleans up resources that can be used to troubleshoot a failed upgrade.
