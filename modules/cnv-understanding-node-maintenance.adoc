= Understanding node maintenance mode

Placing a node into maintenance marks the node as unschedulable and drains all 
the virtual machines and pods from it. Virtual machine instances that have a 
`LiveMigrate` eviction strategy are live migrated to another node without loss 
of service. This eviction strategy is configured by default in virtual machine 
created from common templates but must be configured manually for custom 
virtual machines. 

Virtual machine instances without an eviction strategy will be deleted on the 
node and recreated on another node. 

[NOTE]
====
NFS shared volumes are the only shared data volume type supported for
live migration in {CNVProductName} 2.0.
