= Multiarch Tuning Operator pod labels and architecture support overview

After installing the Multiarch Tuning Operator, you can verify the multi-architecture support for workloads in your cluster. You can identify and manage pods based on their architecture compatibility by using the pod labels. These labels are automatically set on the newly created pods to provide insights into their architecture support.

The following table describes the labels that the Multiarch Tuning Operator adds when you create a pod:

|Label |Description

|`multiarch.openshift.io/multi-arch: ""` |The pod supports multiple architectures.
|`multiarch.openshift.io/single-arch: ""` |The pod supports only a single architecture.
|`multiarch.openshift.io/arm64: ""` |The pod supports the `arm64` architecture.
|`multiarch.openshift.io/amd64: ""` |The pod supports the `amd64` architecture.
|`multiarch.openshift.io/ppc64le: ""` |The pod supports the `ppc64le` architecture.
|`multiarch.openshift.io/s390x: ""` |The pod supports the `s390x` architecture.
|`multirach.openshift.io/node-affinity: set` |The Operator has set the node affinity requirement for the architecture.
|`multirach.openshift.io/node-affinity: not-set` |The Operator did not set the node affinity requirement. For example, when the pod already has a node affinity for the architecture, the Multiarch Tuning Operator adds this label to the pod.
|`multiarch.openshift.io/scheduling-gate: gated` |The pod is gated.
|`multiarch.openshift.io/scheduling-gate: removed` |The pod gate has been removed.
|`multiarch.openshift.io/inspection-error: ""` |An error has occurred while building the node affinity requirements.
