= Multicast in Multitenant mode

When the isolation mode for your cluster is set to `Multitenant`,
you can enable
multicast on a per-project basis by setting an annotation on the project's
corresponding `netnamespace` object.

* In an isolated project, multicast packets sent by a pod will be delivered to
all other pods in the project.
* If you have joined
networks together, you will need to enable multicast in each project's
`netnamespace` in order for it to take effect in any of the projects. Multicast
packets sent by a pod in a joined network will be delivered to all pods in all
of the joined-together networks.
* To enable multicast in the `default` project, you must also enable it in the
`kube-service-catalog` project and all other projects that have been
made global. Multicast
packets sent by a pod in a global project will only be delivered to pods in
other global projects, not to all pods in all projects. Likewise, pods in global
projects will only receive multicast packets sent from pods in other global
projects, not from all pods in all projects.
