= Triggering a PipelineRun

Whenever a `push` event occurs in the Git repository, the configured Webhook sends an event payload to the publicly exposed EventListener service route. The EventListener service of the application processes the payload, and passes it to the relevant TriggerBindings and TriggerTemplates pair. The TriggerBinding extracts the parameters and the TriggerTemplate uses these parameters to create resources. This may rebuild and redeploy the application.

In this section, you push an empty commit to the front-end `vote-ui` repository, which then triggers the PipelineRun.

----
$ git commit -m "empty-commit" --allow-empty && git push origin release-tech-preview-2
