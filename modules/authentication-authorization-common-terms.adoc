= Glossary of common terms for {product-title} authentication and authorization

This glossary defines common terms that are used in {product-title} authentication and authorization.

authentication::
An authentication determines access to an {product-title} cluster and ensures only authenticated users access the {product-title} cluster.

authorization::
Authorization determines whether the identified user has permissions to perform the requested action.

bearer token::
Bearer token is used to authenticate to API with the header `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

// In OSD and ROSA, the CCO is managed by Red Hat SRE.

Cloud Credential Operator::
The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) manages cloud provider credentials as custom resource definitions (CRDs).
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]

config map::
A config map provides a way to inject configuration data into the pods. You can reference the data stored in a config map in a volume of type `ConfigMap`. Applications running in a pod can use this data.

containers::
Lightweight and executable images that consist software and all its dependencies. Because containers virtualize the operating system, you can run containers in a data center, public or private cloud, or your local host.

Custom Resource (CR)::
A CR is an extension of the Kubernetes API.

group::
A group is a set of users. A group is useful for granting permissions to multiple users one time.

HTPasswd::
HTPasswd updates the files that store usernames and password for authentication of HTTP users.

Keystone::
Keystone is an {rh-openstack-first} project that provides identity, token, catalog, and policy services.

Lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP)::
LDAP is a protocol that queries user information.

manual mode::
In manual mode, a user manages cloud credentials instead of the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO).
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]

mint mode::
Mint mode is the default and recommended best practice setting for the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) to use on the platforms for which it is supported. In this mode, the CCO uses the provided administrator-level cloud credential to create new credentials for components in the cluster with only the specific permissions that are required.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]

namespace::
A namespace isolates specific system resources that are visible to all processes. Inside a namespace, only processes that are members of that namespace can see those resources.

node::
A node is a worker machine in the {product-title} cluster. A node is either a virtual machine (VM) or a physical machine.

OAuth client::
OAuth client is used to get a bearer token.

OAuth server::
The {product-title} control plane includes a built-in OAuth server that determines the userâ€™s identity from the configured identity provider and creates an access token.

OpenID Connect::
The OpenID Connect is a protocol to authenticate the users to use single sign-on (SSO) to access sites that use OpenID Providers.

ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
passthrough mode::
In passthrough mode, the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) passes the provided cloud credential to the components that request cloud credentials.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]

pod::
A pod is the smallest logical unit in Kubernetes. A pod is comprised of one or more containers to run in a worker node.

regular users::
Users that are created automatically in the cluster upon first login or via the API.

request header::
A request header is an HTTP header that is used to provide information about HTTP request context, so that the server can track the response of the request.

role-based access control (RBAC)::
A key security control to ensure that cluster users and workloads have access to only the resources required to execute their roles.

service accounts::
Service accounts are used by the cluster components or applications.

system users::
Users that are created automatically when the cluster is installed.

users::
Users is an entity that can make requests to API.
