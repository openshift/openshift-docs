= Debugging low latency CNF tuning status

The `PerformanceProfile` custom resource (CR) contains status fields for reporting tuning status and debugging latency degradation issues. These fields report on conditions that describe the state of the operator's reconciliation functionality.

A typical issue can arise when the status of machine config pools that are attached to the performance profile are in a degraded state, causing the `PerformanceProfile` status to degrade. In this case, the machine config pool issues a failure message.

The Node Tuning Operator contains the `performanceProfile.spec.status.Conditions` status field:

The `Status` field contains `Conditions` that specify `Type` values that indicate the status of the performance profile:

`Available`:: All machine configs and Tuned profiles have been created successfully and are available for cluster components are responsible to process them (NTO, MCO, Kubelet).

`Upgradeable`:: Indicates whether the resources maintained by the Operator are in a state that is safe to upgrade.

`Progressing`:: Indicates that the deployment process from the performance profile has started.

`Degraded`:: Indicates an error if:
+
* Validation of the performance profile has failed.
* Creation of all relevant components did not complete successfully.

Each of these types contain the following fields:

`Status`:: The state for the specific type (`true` or `false`).
`Timestamp`:: The transaction timestamp.
`Reason string`:: The machine readable reason.
`Message string`:: The human readable reason describing the state and error details, if any.

== Machine config pools

A performance profile and its created products are applied to a node according to an associated machine config pool (MCP). The MCP holds valuable information about the progress of applying the machine configurations created by performance profiles that encompass kernel args, kube config, huge pages allocation, and deployment of rt-kernel. The Performance Profile controller monitors changes in the MCP and updates the performance profile status accordingly.

The only conditions returned by the MCP to the performance profile status is when the MCP is `Degraded`, which leads to `performanceProfile.status.condition.Degraded = true`.

.Example

The following example is for a performance profile with an associated machine config pool (`worker-cnf`) that was created for it:

. The associated machine config pool is in a degraded state:
