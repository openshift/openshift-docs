= Removing cloud provider credentials

After installing an {product-title} cluster with the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) in mint mode, you can remove the administrator-level credential secret from the `kube-system` namespace in the cluster. The administrator-level credential is required only during changes that require its elevated permissions, such as upgrades.

[NOTE]
====
Prior to a non z-stream upgrade, you must reinstate the credential secret with the administrator-level credential. If the credential is not present, the upgrade might be blocked.
====

.Prerequisites

* Your cluster is installed on a platform that supports removing cloud credentials from the CCO. Supported platforms are AWS and GCP.

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, navigate to *Workloads* -> *Secrets*.

. In the table on the *Secrets* page, find the root secret for your cloud provider.
