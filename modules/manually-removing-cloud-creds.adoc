= Removing cloud provider credentials

For clusters that use the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) in mint mode, the administrator-level credential is stored in the `kube-system` namespace. 
The CCO uses the `admin` credential to process the `CredentialsRequest` objects in the cluster and create users for components with limited permissions.

After installing an {product-title} cluster with the CCO in mint mode, you can remove the administrator-level credential secret from the `kube-system` namespace in the cluster. 
The CCO only requires the administrator-level credential during changes that require reconciling new or modified `CredentialsRequest` custom resources, such as minor cluster version updates.

[NOTE]
====
Before performing a minor version cluster update (for example, updating from {product-title} {ocp-nminus1} to {product-version}), you must reinstate the credential secret with the administrator-level credential. 
If the credential is not present, the update might be blocked.
