= Removing cloud provider credentials

After installing an {product-title} cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) in mint mode, you can remove the administrator-level credential secret from the `kube-system` namespace in the cluster. The administrator-level credential is required only during changes that require its elevated permissions, such as upgrades.

[NOTE]
====
Prior to a non z-stream upgrade, you must reinstate the credential secret with the administrator-level credential. If the credential is not present, the upgrade might be blocked.
