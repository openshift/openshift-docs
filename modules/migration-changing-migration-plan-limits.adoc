= Changing migration plan limits for large migrations

You can change the migration plan limits for large migrations.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Changes should first be tested in your environment to avoid a failed migration.
====

A single migration plan has the following default limits:

* 10 namespaces
+
If this limit is exceeded, the CAM web console displays a *Namespace limit exceeded* error and you cannot create a migration plan.

* 100 Pods
+
If the Pod limit is exceeded, the CAM web console displays a warning message similar to the following example: *Plan has been validated with warning condition(s). See warning message. Pod limit: 3 exceeded, found: 4*.

* 100 persistent volumes
+
If the persistent volume limit is exceeded, the CAM web console displays a similar warning message.
