= Increasing Migration Controller limits for large migrations

You can increase the Migration Controller limits on migration objects and container resources for large migrations.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must test these changes before you perform a migration in a production environment.

.Procedure

. Edit the Migration Controller manifest:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit migrationcontroller -n openshift-migration
----

. Update the following parameters:
+
[source,yaml]
----
...
mig_controller_limits_cpu: "1" <1>
mig_controller_limits_memory: "10Gi" <2>
...
mig_controller_requests_cpu: "100m" <3>
mig_controller_requests_memory: "350Mi" <4>
...
mig_pv_limit: 100 <5>
mig_pod_limit: 100 <6>
mig_namespace_limit: 10 <7>
...
----
<1> Specifies the number of CPUs available to the Migration Controller.
<2> Specifies the amount of memory available to the Migration Controller.
<3> Specifies the number of CPU units available for Migration Controller requests. `100m` represents 0.1 CPU units (100 * 1e-3).
<4> Specifies the amount of memory available for Migration Controller requests.
<5> Specifies the number of PVs that can be migrated.
<6> Specifies the number of Pods that can be migrated.
<7> Specifies the number of namespaces that can be migrated.

. Create a migration plan that uses the updated parameters to verify the changes.
+
If your migration plan exceeds the Migration Controller limits, the {mtc-short} console displays a warning message when you save the migration plan.
