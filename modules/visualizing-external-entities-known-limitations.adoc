The following are some known limitations of the Visualizing external entities feature:

* You cannot see external IP addresses if they are part of CIDR blocks.
* When you enable external IP collection for a cluster, the Collector in those clusters reports more information to Sensor and Central. Enabling external IP collection might create scalability issues if the workload in the cluster communicates with a large number of distinct external peers. Red{nbsp}Hat recommends that you turn off this feature on clusters with communication patterns involving more than 10,000 distinct external entities. However, if the pattern is mostly ingress or egress, you can overcome the scaling issue by enabling external IPs only in the opposite direction. For more information, see "Using Collector runtime configuration" in the Additional resources section.
