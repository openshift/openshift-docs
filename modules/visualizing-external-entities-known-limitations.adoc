[role="_abstract"]
The following are some known limitations of the Visualizing external entities feature:

* When you enable external IP collection for a cluster, Collector in those clusters report more information to Sensor and to Central. This might create scalability issues if the workload in the cluster communicates with a large number of distinct external peers. It is recommended that you do not enable this feature on clusters with communication patterns involving more than 10,000 distinct external entities.
* The display of IP information on the *Network Graph* page is experimental and uses a graphical item for each IP entity. Enabling this level of detail when the number of peers is a few hundred or more might result in an unreadable user interface and  more than 2,000 peers may result in a potentially unresponsive user interface.
* You cannot see external IP addresses if they are part of CIDR blocks.
