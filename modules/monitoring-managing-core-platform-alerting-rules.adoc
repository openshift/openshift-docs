= Managing alerting rules for core platform monitoring

{product-title} {product-version} monitoring ships with a large set of default alerting rules for platform metrics.
As a cluster administrator, you can customize this set of rules in two ways:

* Modify the settings for existing platform alerting rules by adjusting thresholds or by adding and modifying labels.
For example, you can change the `severity` label for an alert from `warning` to `critical` to help you route and triage issues flagged by an alert.

* Define and add new custom alerting rules by constructing a query expression based on core platform metrics in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace.

.Core platform alerting rule considerations

* New alerting rules must be based on the default {product-title} monitoring metrics.

* You must create the `AlertingRule` and `AlertRelabelConfig` objects in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace.

* You can only add and modify alerting rules. You cannot create new recording rules or modify existing recording rules.

* If you modify existing platform alerting rules by using an `AlertRelabelConfig` object, your modifications are not reflected in the Prometheus alerts API.
Therefore, any dropped alerts still appear in the {product-title} web console even though they are no longer forwarded to Alertmanager.
Additionally, any modifications to alerts, such as a changed `severity` label, do not appear in the web console.
