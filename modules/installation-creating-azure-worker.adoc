[id="installation-creating-azure-worker_{context}"]
= Creating additional worker machines in {cp}

You can create worker machines in Microsoft {cp} for your cluster
to use by launching individual instances discretely or by automated processes
outside the cluster, such as auto scaling groups. You can also take advantage of
the built-in cluster scaling mechanisms and the machine API in {product-title}.

In this example, you manually launch one instance by using the Azure Resource
Manager (ARM) template. Additional instances can be launched by including
additional resources of type `06_workers.json` in the file.

[NOTE]
====
If you do not use the provided ARM template to create your worker machines, you
must review the provided information and manually create the infrastructure. If
your cluster does not initialize correctly, you might have to contact Red Hat
support with your installation logs.
====

.Prerequisites

* Configure an Azure account.
* Generate the Ignition config files for your cluster.
* Create and configure a VNet and associated subnets in {cp}.
* Create and configure networking and load balancers in {cp}.
* Create control plane and compute roles.
* Create the bootstrap machine.
* Create the control plane machines.

.Procedure

. Copy the template from the *ARM template for worker machines*
section of this topic and save it as `06_workers.json` in your cluster's installation directory. This
template describes the worker machines that your cluster requires.

. Export the following variable needed by the worker machine deployment:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export WORKER_IGNITION=`cat <installation_directory>/worker.ign | base64 | tr -d '\n'`
----

. Create the deployment by using the `az` CLI:
+
ifdef::azure[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ az deployment group create -g ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
  --template-file "<installation_directory>/06_workers.json" \
  --parameters workerIgnition="${WORKER_IGNITION}" \ <1>
  --parameters sshKeyData="${SSH_KEY}" \ <2>
  --parameters baseName="${INFRA_ID}" <3>
----
<1> The Ignition content for the worker nodes.
<2> The SSH RSA public key file as a string.
<3> The base name to be used in resource names; this is usually the cluster's infrastructure ID.
endif::azure[]
ifdef::ash[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ az deployment group create -g ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
  --template-file "<installation_directory>/06_workers.json" \
  --parameters workerIgnition="${WORKER_IGNITION}" \ <1>
  --parameters sshKeyData="${SSH_KEY}" \ <2>
  --parameters baseName="${INFRA_ID}" <3>
  --parameters diagnosticsStorageAccountName="${CLUSTER_NAME}sa" <4>
----
<1> The Ignition content for the worker nodes.
<2> The SSH RSA public key file as a string.
<3> The base name to be used in resource names; this is usually the cluster's infrastructure ID.
<4> The name of the storage account for your cluster.
