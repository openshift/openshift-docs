= Removing data volumes

You can delete a data volume by using the `oc` command-line interface (CLI), but be aware that doing so also deleted the underlying provisioned volume claim (PVC).

[WARNING]
====
Removing data volumes manually can produce unexpected results. Instead, use the PVC to manage data volumes. In {VirtProductName} release 4.12 and later, automated garbage collection is used to manage data volumes. This transparent process makes manual removal of data volumes unnecessary.
====

.Prerequisites

* Identify the name of the data volume that you want to delete.

.Procedure

* Delete the data volume by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete dv <datavolume_name>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This command only deletes objects that exist in the current project. Specify the
`-n <project_name>` option if the object you want to delete is in
a different project or namespace.
