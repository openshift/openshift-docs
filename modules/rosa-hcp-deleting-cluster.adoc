= Deleting a {hcp-title} cluster and the cluster-specific IAM resources

You can delete a {hcp-title} cluster by using the ROSA command line interface (CLI) (`rosa`) or {cluster-manager-first}.

After deleting the cluster, you can clean up the cluster-specific Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources in your AWS account by using the ROSA CLI. The cluster-specific resources include the Operator roles and the OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider.

[NOTE]
====
The cluster deletion must complete before you remove the IAM resources, because the resources are used in the cluster deletion and clean up processes.
====

If add-ons are installed, the cluster deletion takes longer because add-ons are uninstalled before the cluster is deleted. The amount of time depends on the number and size of the add-ons.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed a {hcp-title} cluster.
* You have installed and configured the latest ROSA CLI (`rosa`) on your installation host.

.Procedure

. Get the cluster ID, the Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for the cluster-specific Operator roles, and the endpoint URL for the OIDC provider by running the following command:

$ rosa describe cluster --cluster=<cluster_name>

<1> Lists the cluster ID.
<2> Specifies the ARNs for the cluster-specific Operator roles. For example, in the sample output the ARN for the role required by the Machine Config Operator is `arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:role/mycluster-x4q9-openshift-machine-api-aws-cloud-credentials`.
<3> Displays the endpoint URL for the cluster-specific OIDC provider.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After the cluster is deleted, you need the cluster ID to delete the cluster-specific STS resources using the ROSA CLI.
====

. Delete the cluster by using either the {cluster-manager} or the ROSA CLI (`rosa`):
** To delete the cluster by using the {cluster-manager}:
.. Navigate to the {cluster-manager-url}.
.. Click the Options menu {kebab} next to your cluster and select *Delete cluster*.
.. Type the name of your cluster into the prompt and click *Delete*.
** To delete the cluster using the ROSA CLI:
.. Run the following command, replacing `<cluster_name>` with the name or ID of your cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa delete cluster --cluster=<cluster_name> --watch
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must wait for cluster deletion to complete before you remove the Operator roles and the OIDC provider.
====

. Delete the cluster-specific Operator IAM roles by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa delete operator-roles --prefix <operator_role_prefix>
----

.  Delete the OIDC provider by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa delete oidc-provider --oidc-config-id <oidc_config_id>
