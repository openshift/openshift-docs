[id="olm-installing-from-operatorhub-using-web-console_{context}"]
= Installing from OperatorHub using the web console

You can install and subscribe to an Operator from OperatorHub by using the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites

ifdef::olm-admin[]
* Access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin[]
`cluster-admin` permissions.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
the `dedicated-admin` role.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
endif::[]

ifdef::olm-user[]
* Access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with Operator installation permissions.
endif::[]

.Procedure

. Navigate in the web console to the *Operators → OperatorHub* page.

. Scroll or type a keyword into the *Filter by keyword* box to find the Operator you want. For example, type `{filter-type}` to find the {filter-operator} Operator.
+
You can also filter options by *Infrastructure Features*. For example, select *Disconnected* if you want to see Operators that work in disconnected environments, also known as restricted network environments.

. Select the Operator to display additional information.
+
[NOTE]
====
Choosing a Community Operator warns that Red Hat does not certify Community Operators; you must acknowledge the warning before continuing.
====

. Read the information about the Operator and click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page:

ifdef::olm-admin[]
.. Select one of the following:
*** *All namespaces on the cluster (default)* installs the Operator in the default `openshift-operators` namespace to watch and be made available to all namespaces in the cluster. This option is not always available.
*** *A specific namespace on the cluster* allows you to choose a specific, single namespace in which to install the Operator. The Operator will only watch and be made available for use in this single namespace.
endif::[]
ifdef::olm-user[]
.. Choose a specific, single namespace in which to install the Operator. The Operator will only watch and be made available for use in this single namespace.
endif::[]
.. If the cluster is in AWS STS mode, enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS IAM role of your service account in the *role ARN* field.
+
image::oadp-install-operator-role-arn.png[Entering the ARN]
To create the role's ARN, follow the procedure described in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html/tutorials/cloud-experts-deploy-api-data-protection#prepare-aws-account_cloud-experts-deploy-api-data-protection[Preparing AWS account].

.. If more than one update channel is available, select an *Update channel*.

.. Select *Automatic* or *Manual* approval strategy, as described earlier.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If the web console shows that the cluster is in "STS mode", you must set *Update approval* to *Manual*.

Subscriptions with automatic update approvals are not recommended because there might be permission changes to make prior to updating. Subscriptions with manual update approvals ensure that administrators have the opportunity to verify the permissions of the later version and take any necessary steps prior to update.
====

. Click *Install* to make the Operator available to the selected namespaces on this {product-title} cluster.

.. If you selected a *Manual* approval strategy, the upgrade status of the subscription remains *Upgrading* until you review and approve the install plan.
+
After approving on the *Install Plan* page, the subscription upgrade status moves to *Up to date*.

.. If you selected an *Automatic* approval strategy, the upgrade status should resolve to *Up to date* without intervention.

. After the upgrade status of the subscription is *Up to date*, select *Operators → Installed Operators* to verify that the cluster service version (CSV) of the installed Operator eventually shows up. The *Status* should ultimately resolve to *InstallSucceeded* in the relevant namespace.
+
[NOTE]
====
For the *All namespaces...* installation mode, the status resolves to *InstallSucceeded* in the `openshift-operators` namespace, but the status is *Copied* if you check in other namespaces.
====
+
If it does not:

.. Check the logs in any pods in the `openshift-operators` project (or other relevant namespace if *A specific namespace...* installation mode was selected) on the *Workloads → Pods* page that are reporting issues to troubleshoot further.
