= Installing from the OperatorHub using the web console

This procedure uses the Couchbase Operator as an example to install and subscribe to
an Operator from the OperatorHub using the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites

- Access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin[]
`cluster-admin` permissions.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
`dedicated-admins-cluster` permissions.
endif::[]

.Procedure

. Navigate in the web console to the *Operators → OperatorHub* page.

. Scroll or type a keyword into the *Filter by keyword* box (in this case,
`Couchbase`) to find the Operator you want.

. Select the Operator. For a Community Operator, you are warned that Red Hat
does not certify those Operators. You must acknowledge that warning before
continuing. Information about the Operator is displayed.

. Read the information about the Operator and click *Install*.

. On the *Create Operator Subscription* page:
.. Select one of the following:
*** *All namespaces on the cluster (default)* installs the Operator in the default
`openshift-operators` namespace to watch and be made available to all namespaces
in the cluster. This option is not always available.
*** *A specific namespace on the cluster* allows you to choose a specific, single
namespace in which to install the Operator. The Operator will only watch and be
made available for use in this single namespace.
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
If you are installing the Cluster Logging Operator, choose this option to select
the `openshift-logging` namespace.
endif::[]
.. Select an *Update Channel* (if more than one is available).
.. Select *Automatic* or *Manual* approval strategy, as described earlier.

. Click *Subscribe* to make the Operator available to the selected namespaces on
this {product-title} cluster.

.. If you selected a Manual approval strategy, the Subscription's upgrade status
will remain *Upgrading* until you review and approve its Install Plan.

.Manually approving from the *Install Plan* page

+
After approving on the *Install Plan* page, the Subscription upgrade status
moves to *Up to date*.

.. If you selected an Automatic approval strategy, the upgrade status should
resolve to *Up to date* without intervention.
+

. After the Subscription's upgrade status is *Up to date*, select *Operators → Installed Operators*
to verify that the *Couchbase* ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) eventually shows up
and its *Status* ultimately resolves to *InstallSucceeded* in the relevant namespace.
+
[NOTE]
====
For the *All namespaces...* Installation Mode, the status resolves to
*InstallSucceeded* in the `openshift-operators` namespace, but the status is
*Copied* if you check in other namespaces.
====
+
If it does not:

.. Check the logs in any Pods in the `openshift-operators` project (or other
relevant namespace if *A specific namespace...* Installation Mode was selected)
on the *Workloads → Pods* page that are reporting issues to troubleshoot
further.
