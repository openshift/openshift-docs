[id="olm-installing-from-operatorhub-using-web-console_{context}"]
= Installing from OperatorHub using the web console

You can install and subscribe to an Operator from OperatorHub using the
{product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites

ifdef::olm-admin[]
- Access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin[]
`cluster-admin` permissions.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
`dedicated-admins-cluster` permissions.
endif::[]
endif::[]

ifdef::olm-user[]
- Access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with Operator installation
permissions.
endif::[]

.Procedure

. Navigate in the web console to the *Operators → OperatorHub* page.

. Scroll or type a keyword into the *Filter by keyword* box to find the Operator
you want. For example, type `{filter-type}` to find the {filter-operator} Operator.
+
You can also filter options by *Infrastructure Features*. For example, select
*Disconnected* if you want to see Operators that work in disconnected
environments, also known as restricted network environments.

. Select the Operator to display additional information.
+
[NOTE]
====
Choosing a Community Operator warns that Red Hat does not certify Community
Operators; you must acknowledge the warning before continuing.
====

. Read the information about the Operator and click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page:

ifdef::olm-admin[]
.. Select one of the following:
*** *All namespaces on the cluster (default)* installs the Operator in the default
`openshift-operators` namespace to watch and be made available to all namespaces
in the cluster. This option is not always available.
*** *A specific namespace on the cluster* allows you to choose a specific, single
namespace in which to install the Operator. The Operator will only watch and be
made available for use in this single namespace.
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
If you are installing the Cluster Logging Operator, choose this option to select
the `openshift-logging` namespace.
endif::[]
endif::[]
ifdef::olm-user[]
.. Choose a specific, single namespace in which to install the Operator. The
Operator will only watch and be made available for use in this single namespace.
endif::[]

.. Select an *Update Channel* (if more than one is available).

.. Select *Automatic* or *Manual* approval strategy, as described earlier.

. Click *Install* to make the Operator available to the selected namespaces on
this {product-title} cluster.

.. If you selected a Manual approval strategy, the upgrade status of the
Subscription remains *Upgrading* until you review and approve its Install Plan.
+
After approving on the *Install Plan* page, the Subscription upgrade status
moves to *Up to date*.

.. If you selected an Automatic approval strategy, the upgrade status should
resolve to *Up to date* without intervention.

. After the upgrade status of the Subscription is *Up to date*, select
*Operators → Installed Operators* to verify that the ClusterServiceVersion (CSV)
of the installed Operator eventually shows up. Its *Status* should ultimately
resolve to *InstallSucceeded* in the relevant namespace.
+
[NOTE]
====
For the *All namespaces...* Installation Mode, the status resolves to
*InstallSucceeded* in the `openshift-operators` namespace, but the status is
*Copied* if you check in other namespaces.
====
+
If it does not:

.. Check the logs in any pods in the `openshift-operators` project (or other
relevant namespace if *A specific namespace...* Installation Mode was selected)
on the *Workloads → Pods* page that are reporting issues to troubleshoot
further.
