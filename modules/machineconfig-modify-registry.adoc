= Configuring container image registry settings

Settings that define the registries {product-title} uses to get container images
are held in the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` by default. In that file,
you can set registries to not require authentication (insecure), point to
mirrored registries, or set which registries are searched for unqualified
container image requests.

Rather than change `registries.conf` directly, you can drop configuration files
into the `/etc/containers/registries.d` directory that are then automatically
appended to the system's existing `registries.conf` settings.

This procedure describes how to create a `registries.d` file
(`/etc/containers/registries.s/99-worker-unqualified-search-registries.conf`)
that adds `quay.io` as an unqualified search registry (one that {product-title}
can search when it tries to pull an image name does not include the registry name).
It includes base64-encoded content that you can examine as follows:

[source,terminal]
----
$ echo dW5xdWFsaWZpZWQtc2VhcmNoLXJlZ2lzdHJpZXMgPSBbJ3JlZ2lzdHJ5LmFjY2Vzcy5yZWRoYXQuY29tJywgJ2RvY2tlci5pbycsICdxdWF5LmlvJ10K | base64 -d
unqualified-search-registries = ['registry.access.redhat.com', 'docker.io', 'quay.io']
----

See the `containers-registries.conf` man page for the format for the
`registries.conf` and `registries.d` directory files.

.Prerequisites
* Have a running {product-title} cluster (version 4.4 or later).
* Log in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.

.Procedure

. Create a yaml file (`myregistry.yaml`) to hold the contents of the
`/etc/containers/registries.d/99-worker-unqualified-search-registries.conf`
file, including the encoded base64 contents of the for that file. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat > /tmp/myregistry.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
  name: 99-worker-unqualified-search-registries

        filesystem: root
        mode: 0420
        path: /etc/containers/registries.d/99-worker-unqualified-search-registries.conf
EOF
----

. Apply the MachineConfig to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f /tmp/myregistry.yaml
----

. Check that the new MachineConfig has been applied and that the nodes
are not in a degraded state. It may take a few minutes.
The worker pool will show the updates in progress, as each machine successfully
has the new MachineConfig applied:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machineconfigpool

. To check that the change was applied, you can login to a worker node:
+
[source,terminal]

$ oc get node | grep worker
