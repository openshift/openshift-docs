= About CRI-O container runtime engine

CRI-O is a Kubernetes-native container runtime implementation that integrates closely with the operating system to deliver an efficient and optimized Kubernetes experience. CRI-O provides facilities for running, stopping, and restarting containers.

The CRI-O container runtime engine is managed using a systemd service on each {product-title} cluster node. When container runtime issues occur, verify the status of the `crio` systemd service on each node. Gather CRI-O journald unit logs from nodes that manifest container runtime issues.
