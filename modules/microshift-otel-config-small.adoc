<1> Replace the variable `${env:OTEL_BACKEND}` with the IP address or host name of the remote back end. This IP address resolves to the local node's host name. Any unreachable endpoint is reported in the {microshift-short} service logs.

. Restart {microshift-short} Observability to complete the configuration selection.
