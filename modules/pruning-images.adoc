[id="pruning-images_{context}"]
= Automatically pruning images

Images from the {product-registry} that are no longer required by the system due to age, status, or exceed limits are automatically pruned. Cluster administrators can configure the Pruning Custom Resource, or suspend it.

.Prerequisites

* Cluster administrator permissions.
* Install the `oc` CLI.

.Procedure

* Verify that the object named `imagepruners.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster` contains the following `spec` and `status` fields:

----
<1> `schedule`: `CronJob` formatted schedule. This is an optional field, default is daily at midnight.
<2> `suspend`: If set to `true`, the `CronJob` running pruning is suspended. This is an optional field, default is `false`. The initial value on new clusters is `false`.
<3> `keepTagRevisions`: The number of revisions per tag to keep. This is an optional field, default is `3`. The initial value is `3`.
<4> `keepYoungerThanDuration`: Retain images younger than this duration. This is an optional field. If a value is not specified, either `keepYoungerThan` or the default value `60m` (60 minutes) is used.
<5> `keepYoungerThan`: Deprecated. The same as `keepYoungerThanDuration`, but the duration is specified as an integer in nanoseconds. This is an optional field. When `keepYoungerThanDuration` is set, this field is ignored.
<6> `resources`: Standard pod resource requests and limits. This is an optional field.
<7> `affinity`: Standard pod affinity. This is an optional field.
<8> `nodeSelector`: Standard pod node selector. This is an optional field.
<9> `tolerations`: Standard pod tolerations. This is an optional field.
<10> `successfulJobsHistoryLimit`: The maximum number of successful jobs to retain. Must be `>= 1` to ensure metrics are reported. This is an optional field, default is `3`. The initial value is `3`.
<11> `failedJobsHistoryLimit`: The maximum number of failed jobs to retain. Must be `>= 1` to ensure metrics are reported. This is an optional field, default is `3`. The initial value is `3`.
<12> `observedGeneration`: The generation observed by the Operator.
<13> `conditions`: The standard condition objects with the following types:
* `Available`: Indicates if the pruning job has been created. Reasons can be Ready or Error.
* `Scheduled`: Indicates if the next pruning job has been scheduled. Reasons can be Scheduled, Suspended, or Error.
* `Failed`: Indicates if the most recent pruning job failed.


[IMPORTANT]
====
The Image Registry Operator's behavior for managing the pruner is orthogonal to the `managementState` specified on the Image Registry Operator's `ClusterOperator` object. If the Image Registry Operator is not in the `Managed` state, the image pruner can still be configured and managed by the Pruning Custom Resource.

However, the `managementState` of the Image Registry Operator alters the behavior of the deployed image pruner job:

* `Managed`: the `--prune-registry` flag for the image pruner is set to `true`.
* `Removed`: the `--prune-registry` flag for the image pruner is set to `false`, meaning it only prunes image metatdata in etcd.
