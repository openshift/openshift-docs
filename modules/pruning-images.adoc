= Automatically pruning images

Images that are no longer required by the system due to age,
status, or exceed limits are automatically pruned. Cluster administrators can configure the pruning custom resource (CR), or suspend it.

.Prerequisites

* Cluster administrator permissions.
* Install the `oc` CLI.

.Procedure

* Verify that the object named `imagepruners.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster` contains the following `spec` and `status` fields:

<1> Optional. `CronJob` formatted `schedule`. The default setting is daily at midnight.
<2> Optional. If `suspend` is set to `true`, the `CronJob` running pruning is suspended. The `suspend` field is set to `false` by default. The initial value on new clusters is `false`.
<3> Optional. `keepTagRevisions` is the number of revisions per tag to keep. The  default value is `3`. The initial value is `3`.
<4> Optional. `keepYoungerThanDuration` retains images younger than this duration. If a value is not specified, either `keepYoungerThan` or the default value `60m` (60 minutes) is used.
<5> Optional. `keepYoungerThan` is the same as `keepYoungerThanDuration`, but the duration is specified as an integer in nanoseconds. When `keepYoungerThanDuration` is set, this field is ignored. `keepYoungerThan` is deprecated.
<6> Optional. `resources` are the standard pod resource requests and limits.
<7> Optional. `affinity` is the standard pod affinity.
<8> Optional. `nodeSelector` is the standard pod node selector.
<9> Optional. `tolerations` is the standard pod tolerations.
<10> Optional. `successfulJobsHistoryLimit` is the maximum number of successful jobs to retain. The value must be  set to `>= 1` to ensure metrics are reported. The default is `3`. The initial value is `3`.
<11> Optional. `failedJobsHistoryLimit`: The maximum number of failed jobs to retain. Must be `>= 1` to ensure metrics are reported. This is an optional field, default is `3`. The initial value is `3`.
<12> Optional. `ignoreInvalidImageReferences` indicates whether the pruner can ignore errors while parsing image references. The default value is `true`.
<13> Optional. `observedGeneration` is the generation observed by the Operator.
<14> Optional. `conditions`: The standard condition objects with the following types:

- `Available`: Indicates if the pruning job has been created. Reasons can be `AsExpected` or `Error`.
- `Scheduled`: Indicates if the next pruning job has been scheduled. Reasons can be `Scheduled` or `Suspended`.
- `Failed`: Indicates if the most recent pruning job failed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Image Registry Operator's behavior for managing the pruner is orthogonal to the `managementState` specified on the Image Registry Operator's `ClusterOperator` object. If the Image Registry Operator is not in the `Managed` state, the image pruner can still be configured and managed by the Pruning Custom Resource.

However, the `managementState` of the Image Registry Operator alters the behavior of the deployed image pruner job:

* `Managed`: the `--prune-registry` flag for the image pruner is set to `true`.
* `Removed`: the `--prune-registry` flag for the image pruner is set to `false`, meaning it only prunes image metatdata in etcd.
* `Unmanaged`: the `--prune-registry` flag for the image pruner is set to `false`.
