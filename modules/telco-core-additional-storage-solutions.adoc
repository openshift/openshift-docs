= Additional storage solutions
You can use other storage solutions to provide persistent storage for telco core clusters.
The configuration and integration of these solutions is outside the scope of the reference design specifications (RDS).

Integration of the storage solution into the telco core cluster must include proper sizing and performance analysis to ensure the storage meets overall performance and resource usage requirements.
