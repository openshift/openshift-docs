The {loki-op} supports link:https://aws.amazon.com/[AWS S3], as well as other S3 compatible object stores such as link:https://min.io/[Minio] and link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift-data-foundation[{rh-storage}]. link:https://azure.microsoft.com[Azure], link:https://cloud.google.com/[GCS], and link:https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/[Swift] are also supported.

The recommended nomenclature for Loki storage is `logging-loki-_<your_storage_provider>_`.

The following table shows the `type` values within the `LokiStack` custom resource (CR) for each storage provider. For more information, see the section on your storage provider.
