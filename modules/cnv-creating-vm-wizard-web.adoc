= Running the virtual machine wizard to create a virtual machine

The web console features an interactive wizard that guides you through *Basic Settings*, *Networking*, and *Storage* screens to simplify the process of creating virtual machines. All required fields are marked by a `*`. The wizard prevents you from moving to the next screen until the required fields have been completed.

NICs and storage disks can be created and attached to virtual machines after they have been created.

.*Bootable Disk*

If either `URL` or `Container` are selected as the *Provision Source* in the *Basic Settings* screen, a `rootdisk` disk is created and attached to the virtual machine as the *Bootable Disk*. You can modify the `rootdisk` but you cannot remove it.

A *Bootable Disk* is not required for virtual machines provisioned from a *PXE* source if there are no disks attached to the virtual machine. If one or more disks are attached to the virtual machine, you must select one as the *Bootable Disk*.
