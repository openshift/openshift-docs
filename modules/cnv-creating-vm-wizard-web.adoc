= Running the virtual machine wizard to create a virtual machine

The web console features an interactive wizard that guides you through *Basic Settings*, *Networking*, and *Storage* screens to simplify the process of creating virtual machines. All required fields are marked by a `*`. The wizard prevents you from moving to the next screen until the required fields have been completed.

NICs and storage disks can be created and attached to virtual machines after they have been created.

.*Bootable Disk*

If either `URL` or `Container` are selected as the *Provision Source* in the *Basic Settings* screen, a `rootdisk` disk is created and attached to the virtual machine as the *Bootable Disk*. You can modify the `rootdisk` but you cannot remove it.

A *Bootable Disk* is not required for virtual machines provisioned from a *PXE* source if there are no disks attached to the virtual machine. If one or more disks are attached to the virtual machine, you must select one as the *Bootable Disk*.

.Prerequisites

* When you create your virtual machine using the wizard, your virtual machine's storage medium must support Read-Write-Many (RWM) PVCs.

.Procedure

. Click *Workloads* -> *Virtual Machines* from the side menu.
. Click *Create Virtual Machine* and select *Create with Wizard*.
. Fill in all required *Basic Settings*. Selecting a *Template* automatically fills in these fields.

.. (Optional) Click *Create NIC* to create additional NICs.
.. (Optional) You can remove any or all NICs by clicking the &#8942; button and selecting *Remove NIC*. A virtual machine does not need a NIC attached to be created. NICs can be created after the virtual machine has been created.
. Click *Next* to progress to the *Storage* screen.
.. (Optional) Click *Create Disk* to create additional disks. These disks can be removed by clicking the &#8942; button and selecting *Remove Disk*.

.. (Optional) Click *Attach Disk* to choose an available disk from the *Select Storage* drop-down list.
. Click *Create Virtual Machine >*. The *Results* screen displays the JSON configuration file for the virtual machine.

The virtual machine is listed in *Workloads* -> *Virtual Machines*.
