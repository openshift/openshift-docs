= The GitOps approach

ZTP uses the GitOps deployment set of practices for infrastructure deployment that allows developers to perform tasks that would otherwise fall under the purview of IT operations. GitOps achieves these tasks using declarative specifications stored in Git repositories, such as YAML files and other defined patterns, that provide a framework for deploying the infrastructure. The declarative output is leveraged by the Open Cluster Manager (OCM) for multisite deployment.

One of the motivators for a GitOps approach is the requirement for reliability at scale. This is a significant challenge that GitOps helps solve.

GitOps addresses the reliability issue by providing traceability, RBAC, and a single source of truth for the desired state of each site. Scale issues are addressed by GitOps providing structure, tooling, and event driven operations through webhooks.
