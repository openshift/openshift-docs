= EventPolicy status and application

The status of an EventPolicy provides runtime information about which sources have been resolved and whether the policy is active and ready as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
status:
  from:
    - system:serviceaccount:default:trusted-app
    - "system:serviceaccount:default:other-*"
  conditions:
    - type: Ready
      status: "True"
    - type: SubjectsResolved
      status: "True"
----

Event consumers, such as Brokers, reflect which EventPolicies apply to them in their status.

[source,yaml]
----
status:
  policies:
    - name: my-event-policy
      apiVersion: v1alpha1
  conditions:
    - type: Ready
      status: "True"
    - type: EventPoliciesReady
      status: "True"
----

These conditions indicate whether EventPolicies are ready and have been successfully applied to the resource.

If an incoming request fails to satisfy any applicable EventPolicy, it will be rejected with an HTTP 403 Forbidden status code. If multiple EventPolicies apply to a resource, an event is accepted as long as it matches at least one of them. This ensures that unauthorized event deliveries are blocked at the system level.

When multiple EventPolicies apply to the same resource, the system evaluates them in parallel. An event is accepted if it matches at least one applicable EventPolicy. This approach allows flexibility, as valid events are not rejected even under strict authorization, so long as they satisfy the requirements of at least one policy.
