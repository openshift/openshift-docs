= Adding an external certificate authority key and certificate

By default, {ProductName} generates self-signed root certificate and key, and uses them to sign the workload certificates. You can also use the user-defined certificate and key to sign workload certificates, with user-defined root certificate. This task demonstrates an example to plug certificates and key into {ProductShortName}.

.Prerequisites

* You must have installed {ProductName} with mutual TLS enabled to configure certificates.
* This example uses the certificates from the link:https://github.com/maistra/istio/tree/maistra-2.0/samples/certs[Maistra repository]. For production, use your own certificates from your certificate authority.
* You must deploy the Bookinfo sample application to verify the results with these instructions.

== Adding an existing certificate and key

To use an existing signing (CA) certificate and key, you must create a chain of trust file that includes the CA certificate, key, and root certificate. You must use the following exact file names for each of the corresponding certificates. The CA certificate is called `ca-cert.pem`, the key is `ca-key.pem`, and the root certificate, which signs `ca-cert.pem`, is called `root-cert.pem`. If your workload uses intermediate certificates, you must specify them in a `cert-chain.pem` file.

Add the certificates to {ProductShortName} by following these steps. Save the example certificates from the link:https://github.com/maistra/istio/tree/maistra-2.0/samples/certs[Maistra repository] locally and replace `<path>` with the path to your certificates.

. Create a secret `cacert` that includes the input files `ca-cert.pem`, `ca-key.pem`, `root-cert.pem` and `cert-chain.pem`.

$ oc create secret generic cacerts -n istio-system --from-file=<path>/ca-cert.pem \
    --from-file=<path>/ca-key.pem --from-file=<path>/root-cert.pem \
    --from-file=<path>/cert-chain.pem
----
+
. In the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource set `spec.security.dataPlane.mtls: true` to `true` and configure your certificateAuthority like the following example. The default `rootCADir` is `/etc/cacerts`. You do not need to set the `privateKey` if the key and certs are mounted in the default location.  {ProductShortName} reads the certificates and key from the secret-mount files.

[source,yaml]

          rootCADir:  /etc/cacerts
----

. To make sure the workloads add the new certificates promptly, delete the secrets generated by {ProductShortName}, named `istio.*`. In this example, `istio.default`. {ProductShortName} issues new certificates for the workloads.

== Verifying your certificates

Use the Bookinfo sample application to verify your certificates are mounted correctly. First, retrieve the mounted certificates. Then, verify the certificates mounted on the pod.

. Store the pod name in the variable `RATINGSPOD`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ RATINGSPOD=`oc get pods -l app=ratings -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}'`
----
+
. Run the following commands to retrieve the certificates mounted on the proxy.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -it $RATINGSPOD -c istio-proxy -- /bin/cat /var/run/secrets/istio/root-cert.pem > /tmp/pod-root-cert.pem
----
+
The file `/tmp/pod-root-cert.pem` contains the root certificate propagated to the pod.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -it $RATINGSPOD -c istio-proxy -- /bin/cat /etc/certs/cert-chain.pem > /tmp/pod-cert-chain.pem
----
+
The file `/tmp/pod-cert-chain.pem` contains the workload certificate and the CA certificate propagated to the pod.
+
. Verify the root certificate is the same as the one specified by the Operator. Replace `<path>` with the path to your certificates.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openssl x509 -in <path>/root-cert.pem -text -noout > /tmp/root-cert.crt.txt

----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ diff /tmp/root-cert.crt.txt /tmp/pod-root-cert.crt.txt

== Removing the certificates

To remove the certificates you added, follow these steps.

. Remove the secret `cacerts`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete secret cacerts -n istio-system
----
+
. Redeploy {ProductShortName} with a self-signed root certificate in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.
