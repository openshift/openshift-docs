= Symbolic links for in-tree dependencies

Some kernel modules depend on other kernel modules that are shipped with the node's operating system. To avoid copying those dependencies into the kmod image, Kernel Module Management (KMM) mounts `/usr/lib/modules` into both the build and the worker pod's filesystems.

By creating a symlink from `/opt/usr/lib/modules/<kernel_version>/<symlink_name>` to `/usr/lib/modules/<kernel_version>`, `depmod` can use the in-tree kmods on the building node's filesystem to resolve dependencies.

At runtime, the worker pod extracts the entire image, including the `<symlink_name>` symbolic link. That symbolic link points to `/usr/lib/modules/<kernel_version>` in the worker pod, which is mounted from the node's filesystem. `modprobe` can then follow that link and load the in-tree dependencies as needed.

In the following example, `host` is the symbolic link name under `/opt/usr/lib/modules/<kernel_version>`:

[source,dockerfile]

ARG DTK_AUTO

FROM ${DTK_AUTO} as builder

#
# Build steps
#

FROM ubi9/ubi

ARG KERNEL_FULL_VERSION

RUN dnf update && dnf install -y kmod

COPY --from=builder /usr/src/kernel-module-management/ci/kmm-kmod/kmm_ci_a.ko /opt/lib/modules/${KERNEL_FULL_VERSION}/
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/kernel-module-management/ci/kmm-kmod/kmm_ci_b.ko /opt/lib/modules/${KERNEL_FULL_VERSION}/

# Create the symbolic link
RUN ln -s /lib/modules/${KERNEL_FULL_VERSION} /opt/lib/modules/${KERNEL_FULL_VERSION}/host

RUN depmod -b /opt ${KERNEL_FULL_VERSION}
----

[NOTE]
====
`depmod` generates dependency files based on the kernel modules present on the node that runs the kmod image build.

On the node on which KMM loads the kernel modules, `modprobe` expects the files to be present under `/usr/lib/modules/<kernel_version>`, and the same filesystem layout. It is highly recommended that the build and the target nodes share the same operating system and release.
