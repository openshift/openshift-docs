= Modifiable fields with default values

[role="_abstract"]
You can change various default configuration fields in the `TektonConfig` custom resource (CR) to tailor the behavior of your pipelines. This reference lists the available fields, such as sidecar injection and metric levels, along with their default values and descriptions.

The following list includes all modifiable fields with their default values in the `TektonConfig` CR:

* `running-in-environment-with-injected-sidecars` (default: `true`): Set this field to `false` if pipelines run in a cluster that does not use injected sidecars, such as Istio. Setting it to `false` decreases the time a pipeline takes for a task run to start.
+
[NOTE]
====
For clusters that use injected sidecars, setting this field to `false` can lead to an unexpected behavior.
====

* `await-sidecar-readiness` (default: `true`): Set this field to `false` to stop {pipelines-shortname} from waiting for `TaskRun` sidecar containers to run before it begins to operate. When set to `false`, tasks run in environments that do not support the `downwardAPI` volume type.

* `default-service-account` (default: `pipeline`): This field has the default service account name to use for the `TaskRun` and `PipelineRun` resources, if none is specified.

* `require-git-ssh-secret-known-hosts` (default: `false`): Setting this field to `true` requires that any Git SSH secret must include the `known_hosts` field. 

** For more information about configuring Git SSH secrets, see  _Configuring SSH authentication for Git_ in the _Additional resources_ section.

* `enable-tekton-oci-bundles` (default: `false`): Set this field to `true` to enable the use of an experimental alpha feature named Tekton OCI bundle.

* `enable-api-fields` (default: `stable`): You can enable or disable API fields. Acceptable values are `stable`, `beta`, or `alpha`.
+
[NOTE]
====
{pipelines-title} does not support the `alpha` value.
====

* `enable-provenance-in-status` (default: `false`): Set this field to `true` to enable populating the `provenance` field in `TaskRun` and `PipelineRun` statuses. The `provenance` field has metadata about resources used in the task run and pipeline run, such as the source for fetching a remote task or pipeline definition.

* `enable-custom-tasks` (default: `true`): Set this field to `false` to disable the use of custom tasks in pipelines.

* `disable-creds-init` (default: `false`): Set this field to `true` to prevent {pipelines-shortname} from scanning attached service accounts and injecting any credentials into your steps.

* `disable-affinity-assistant` (default: `true`): Set this field to `false` to enable affinity assistant for each `TaskRun` resource sharing a persistent volume claim workspace.

You can modify the default values of the following metrics fields in the `TektonConfig` CR:

* `metrics.taskrun.duration-type` and `metrics.pipelinerun.duration-type` (default: `histogram`): Setting these fields determines the duration type for a task or pipeline run. Acceptable value is `gauge` or `histogram`.

* `metrics.taskrun.level` (default: `task`): This field determines the level of the task run metrics. Acceptable value is `taskrun`, `task`, or `namespace`.

* `metrics.pipelinerun.level` (default: `pipeline`): This field determines the level of the pipeline run metrics. Acceptable value is `pipelinerun`, `pipeline`, or `namespace`.
