= LVMS deployment

LVMS is automatically deployed on to the cluster in the `openshift-storage` namespace after {microshift-short} starts.

LVMS uses `StorageCapacity` tracking to ensure that pods with an LVMS PVC are not scheduled if the requested storage is greater than the free storage of the volume group. For more information about `StorageCapacity` tracking, read link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-capacity/[Storage Capacity].
