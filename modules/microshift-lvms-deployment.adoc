= LVMS Deployment

LVMS is automatically deployed on to the cluster in the `openshift-storage` namespace after {product-title} boots.

LVMS uses `StorageCapacity` tracking to ensure that pods with an LVMS PVC are not scheduled if the requested storage is greater than the volume group's remaining free storage. For more information about `StorageCapacity` tracking, refer to link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-capacity/[Storage Capacity].
