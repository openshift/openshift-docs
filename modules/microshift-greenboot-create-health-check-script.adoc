= Creating a health check script

You can create a health check script for installed workloads by placing them in the `/etc/greenboot/check/required.d` directory. The following procedure provides an example of installing the busybox application and creating a health check script for busybox. You can use this example as a general guide for creating health check scripts for your applications.

.Prerequisite

* You have installed a workload. For this example, the busybox application is used as a workload. The "Additional resources" section that follows this procedure has a link to instructions on deploying workloads using manifests.

.Procedure

. To create a health check script, run the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ SCRIPT_FILE=/etc/greenboot/check/required.d/50_busybox_running_check.sh
sudo curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/microshift/3b7f6025cd77bd1bf827416fd026783ead82b7c8/docs/config/busybox_running_check.sh \
  -o ${SCRIPT_FILE} && echo SUCCESS || echo ERROR
sudo chmod 755 ${SCRIPT_FILE}
----
+
In this example, the script verifies that busybox is running as expected. You can replace `/etc/greenboot/check/required.d/50_busybox_running_check.sh` with your own workload details.
+
[NOTE]
====
In this example, the {product-title} core service health checks run before the user workload health checks.
====

. To test that your script is running as expected:

.. Restart the system.

.. Once the system has restarted, run the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ sudo journalctl -o cat -u greenboot-healthcheck.service
----
+
.Example output for the busybox health check script
+
[source, terminal]
