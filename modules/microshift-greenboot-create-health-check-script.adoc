= How to create a health check script for your application

You can create workload or application health check scripts in the text editor of your choice using the example in this documentation. Save the scripts in the `/etc/greenboot/check/required.d` directory. When a script in the `/etc/greenboot/check/required.d` directory exits with an error, Greenboot triggers a reboot in an attempt to heal the system.

[NOTE]
====
Any script in the `/etc/greenboot/check/required.d` directory triggers a reboot if it exits with an error.
====

If your health check logic requires any post-check steps, you can also create additional scripts and save them in the relevant greenboot directories. For example:

* You can also place shell scripts you want to run after a boot has been declared successful in `/etc/greenboot/green.d`.
* You can place shell scripts you want to run after a boot has been declared failed in `/etc/greenboot/red.d`. For example, if you have steps to heal the system before restarting, you can create scripts for your use case and place them in the `/etc/greenboot/red.d` directory.

== About the workload health check script example

The following example uses the {microshift-short} health check script as a template. You can use this example with the provided libraries as a guide for creating basic health check scripts for your applications.

[id="microshift-greenboot-app-health-check-basic-prereqs_{context}"]
=== Basic prerequisites for creating a health check script

* The workload must be installed.
* You must have root access.

[id="microshift-greenboot-app-health-check-ex-reqs_{context}"]
=== Example and functional requirements

You can start with the following example health check script. Modify it for your use case. In your workload health check script, you must complete the following minimum steps:

* Set the environment variables.
* Define the user workload namespaces.
* List the expected pod count.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Choose a name prefix for your application that ensures it runs after the `40_microshift_running_check.sh` script, which implements the {product-title} health check procedure for its core services.
