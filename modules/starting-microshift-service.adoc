. As a root user, start the {product-title} service by entering the following command:

$ sudo systemctl start microshift

. Optional: To configure your {op-system} machine to start {product-title} when your machine starts, enter the following command:

[NOTE]
====
The first time that the {product-title} service starts, it downloads and initializes {product-title}'s container images. As a result, it can take several minutes for {product-title} to start the first time that the service is deployed.
Boot time is reduced for subsequent starts of the MicroShift service.
