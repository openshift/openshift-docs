= Modifying the number of unavailable worker nodes

By default, only one machine is allowed to be unavailable when applying the kubelet-related configuration to the available worker nodes. For a large cluster, it can take a long time for the configuration change to be reflected. At any time, you can adjust the number of machines that are updating to speed up the process.

.Procedure

. Run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineconfigpool worker
----

. Set `maxUnavailable` to the value that you want:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  maxUnavailable: <node_count>
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
When setting the value, consider the number of worker nodes that can be
unavailable without affecting the applications running on the cluster.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Care must be exercised when modifying the `KubeletConfig` as improper 
modifications to the `KubeletConfig` may render the kubelet unable to 
start.  This will result in the impacted node(s) becoming `NotReady`.
If this occurs it will be necessary to collect a `sosreport` to diagnose 
the reason for the node not becoming `Ready`.
