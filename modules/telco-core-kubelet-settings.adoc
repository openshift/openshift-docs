Some CNF workloads make use of sysctls which are not in the list of system-wide safe `sysctls`.
Generally network sysctls are namespaced and can be enabled by using the `kubeletconfig.experimental` annotation in the PerformanceProfile as a string of JSON in the form `allowedUnsafeSysctls`.

Additionally, the `systemReserved` memory can be configured through the same `kubeletconfig.experimental` annotation to reserve memory for system daemons and kernel processes.

.Example snippet showing allowedUnsafeSysctls and systemReserved

  annotations:
    # allowedUnsafeSysctls: some pods want the kernel stack to ignore IPv6 router Advertisement.
    # systemReserved: when used, it should be tailored for each environment.

[NOTE]
====
Although these are namespaced they may allow a pod to consume memory or other resources beyond any limits specified in the pod description. You must ensure that these `sysctls` do not exhaust platform resources.
