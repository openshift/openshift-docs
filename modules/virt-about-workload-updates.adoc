= About workload updates

* When you upgrade {VirtProductName}, virtual machine workloads including `libvirt`, `virt-launcher`, and `qemu` update automatically if they support live migration.
+
[NOTE]
====
Each virtual machine has a `virt-launcher` pod that runs the virtual machine
instance. The `virt-launcher` pod runs an instance of `libvirt`, which is
used to manage the virtual machine process.
====

** There are two available workload update methods: `LiveMigrate` and `Evict`. By default, only `LiveMigrate` is enabled, which means that:

*** Virtual machine instances (VMIs) that support live migration are migrated during the upgrade process.

*** VMIs are not updated at all if the following conditions are both true:

**** The VMI does not support live migration.

**** The VMI is configured to use the `LiveMigrate` eviction strategy.

** You can configure how workloads are updated by editing the `spec.workloadUpdateStrategy` stanza of the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR).
