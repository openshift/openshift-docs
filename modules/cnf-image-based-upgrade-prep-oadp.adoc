= Creating OADP ConfigMap objects for the image-based upgrade with {lcao}

Create your OADP resources that are used to back up and restore your resources during the upgrade.

.Prerequisites

* Generate a seed image from a compatible seed cluster.
* Create OADP backup and restore resources.
* Create a separate partition on the target cluster for the container images that is shared between stateroots. For more information about, see "Configuring a shared container partition for the image-based upgrade".
* Deploy a version of {lcao} that is compatible with the version used with the seed image.
* Install the OADP Operator, the `DataProtectionApplication` CR, and its secret on the target cluster.
* Create an S3-compatible storage solution and a ready-to-use bucket with proper credentials configured. For more information, see "About installing OADP".

.Procedure

. Create the OADP `Backup` and `Restore` CRs for platform artifacts in the same namespace where the OADP Operator is installed, which is `openshift-adp`.

.. If the target cluster is managed by {rh-rhacm}, add the following YAML file for backing up and restoring {rh-rhacm} artifacts:
+
--
.PlatformBackupRestore.yaml for {rh-rhacm}
include::snippets/ibu-PlatformBackupRestore.adoc[]
--

.. If you created persistent volumes on your cluster through {lvms}, add the following YAML file for {lvms} artifacts:
+
.PlatformBackupRestoreLvms.yaml for {lvms}
include::snippets/ibu-PlatformBackupRestoreLvms.adoc[]

. If you need to restore applications after the upgrade, create the OADP `Backup` and `Restore` CRs for your application in the `openshift-adp` namespace.

.. Create the OADP CRs for cluster-scoped application artifacts in the `openshift-adp` namespace.
+
.Example OADP CRs for cluster-scoped application artifacts for LSO and {LVMS}
include::snippets/ibu-ApplicationClusterScopedBackupRestore.adoc[]

.. Create the OADP CRs for your namespace-scoped application artifacts.

.Example OADP CRs namespace-scoped application artifacts when {lvms} is used
include::snippets/ibu-ApplicationBackupRestoreLvms.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The same version of the applications must function on both the current and the target release of {product-title}.

. Create the `ConfigMap` object for your OADP CRs by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create configmap oadp-cm-example --from-file=example-oadp-resources.yaml=<path_to_oadp_crs> -n openshift-adp
----

. Patch the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch imagebasedupgrades.lca.openshift.io upgrade \
  -p='{"spec": {"oadpContent": [{"name": "oadp-cm-example", "namespace": "openshift-adp"}]}}' \
  --type=merge -n openshift-lifecycle-agent
