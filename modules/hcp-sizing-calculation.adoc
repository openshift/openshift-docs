= Sizing calculation example

This example provides sizing guidance for the following scenario:

* Three bare-metal workers that are labeled as `hypershift.openshift.io/control-plane` nodes
* `maxPods` value set to 500
* The expected API rate is medium or about 1000, according to the load-based limits

.{hcp-capital} capacity metrics
|===

| Name | Description

| `mce_hs_addon_request_based_hcp_capacity_gauge`
| Estimated maximum number of {hcp} the cluster can host based on a highly available {hcp} resource request.

| `mce_hs_addon_low_qps_based_hcp_capacity_gauge`
| Estimated maximum number of {hcp} the cluster can host if all {hcp} make around 50 QPS to the clusters Kube API server.

| `mce_hs_addon_medium_qps_based_hcp_capacity_gauge`
| Estimated maximum number of {hcp} the cluster can host if all {hcp} make around 1000 QPS to the clusters Kube API server.

| `mce_hs_addon_high_qps_based_hcp_capacity_gauge`
| Estimated maximum number of {hcp} the cluster can host if all {hcp} make around 2000 QPS to the clusters Kube API server.

| `mce_hs_addon_average_qps_based_hcp_capacity_gauge`
| Estimated maximum number of {hcp} the cluster can host based on the existing average QPS of {hcp}. If you do not have an active {hcp}, you can expect low QPS.
