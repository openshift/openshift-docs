= Configuring an ACME issuer by using explicit credentials for GCP Cloud DNS

You can use the {cert-manager-operator} to set up an ACME issuer to solve DNS-01 challenges by using explicit credentials on GCP. This procedure uses _Let's Encrypt_ as the ACME CA server and shows how to solve DNS-01 challenges with Google CloudDNS.

.Prerequisites

* You have set up Google Cloud service account with a desired role for Google CloudDNS. For more information, see link:https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/google/[Google CloudDNS] in the upstream cert-manager documentation.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can use Google CloudDNS with explicit credentials in an {product-title} cluster that is not running on GCP.
====

.Procedure

. Create a secret to store your GCP credentials by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create secret generic clouddns-dns01-solver-svc-acct --from-file=service_account.json=<path/to/gcp_service_account.json> -n my-issuer-namespace
----

. Create an issuer:

.. Create a YAML file that defines the `Issuer` object:
+
.Example `issuer.yaml` file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: <acme_dns01_clouddns_issuer> <1>
  namespace: <issuer_namespace> <2>
spec:
  acme:
    preferredChain: ""
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: <secret_private_key> <3>
    server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory <4>
    solvers:
    - dns01:
        cloudDNS:
          project: <project_id> <5>
          serviceAccountSecretRef:
            name: clouddns-dns01-solver-svc-acct <6>
            key: service_account.json <7>
----
<1> Provide a name for the issuer.
<2> Replace `<issuer_namespace>` with your issuer namespace.
<3> Replace `<secret_private_key>` with the name of the secret to store the ACME account private key in.
<4> Specify the URL to access the ACME server's `directory` endpoint. This example uses the _Let's Encrypt_ staging environment.
<5> Replace `<project_id>` with the name of the GCP project that contains the Cloud DNS zone.
<6> Specify the name of the secret you created.
<7> Specify the key in the secret you created that stores your GCP secret access key.

.. Create the `Issuer` object by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f issuer.yaml
