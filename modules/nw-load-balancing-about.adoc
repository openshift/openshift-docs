= Supported load balancers

Load balancing distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to maintain the health and efficiency of your clusters by ensuring that no single server bears too much load. Load balancers are devices that perform load balancing. They act as intermediaries between clients and servers to manage and direct traffic based on predefined rules. 

{product-title} supports the following types of load balancers:

* Classic Load Balancer (CLB)
* Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
* Network Load Balancer (NLB)
* Application Load Balancer (ALB)

ELB is the default load-balancer type for AWS routers. CLB is the default for self-managed environments. NLB is the default for Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA).

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use ALB in front of an application but not in front of a router. Using an ALB requires the AWS Load Balancer Operator add-on. This operator is not supported for all {aws-first} regions or for all {product-title} profiles.
