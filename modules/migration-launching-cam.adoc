= Launching the CAM web console

You can launch the CAM web console in a browser.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} cluster on which you have installed the CAM tool.
. Obtain the CAM web console URL by entering the following command:
+
----
$ oc get -n openshift-migration route/migration -o go-template='https://{{ .spec.host }}'
----
+
The output resembles the following: `\https://migration-openshift-migration.apps.cluster.openshift.com`.

. Launch a browser and navigate to the CAM web console.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you try to access the CAM web console immediately after installing the Cluster Application Migration Operator, the console may not load because the Operator is still configuring the cluster. Wait a few minutes and retry.
====

. If you are using self-signed CA certificates, you will be prompted to accept the CA certificate of the source cluster's API server. The web page guides you through the process of accepting the remaining certificates.

. Log in with your {product-title} *username* and *password*.
