= Launching the CAM web console

You can launch the CAM web console that is installed on the {product-title} 4.2 target cluster.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} 4.2 cluster.
. Obtain the CAM web console URL:
+
----
$ oc get -n openshift-migration route/migration -o go-template='(?i}//{{ .spec.host }}(:|\z){{ println }}' | sed 's,\.,\\.,g'
----

. If you are using self-signed certificates, launch a browser and accept the CA certificates manually for the following:

* CAM tool host's OAuth and API server, for example, `\https://<CAM_web_console_URL>:6443/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
* Source cluster's OAuth server, for example, `\https://<master1.cluster.com>/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`. `<master1.cluster.com>` is the URL of the source cluster's master node.
* Source cluster's API server, for example, `\https://<master1.cluster.com>/api/v1/namespaces`. `<master1.cluster.com>` is the URL of the source cluster's master node.

. Navigate to the CAM web console URL.

[NOTE]
====
If you log in to the CAM web console immediately after installing the CAM Operator, the web console may not load because the Operator is still configuring the cluster and enabling cross-origin resource sharing. Wait a few minutes and retry.
====

. Log in with your {product-title} *username* and *password*.
