= Launching the {mtc-short} web console

You can launch the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) web console in a browser.

.Prerequisites

* The {mtc-short} web console must have network access to the {product-title} web console.
* The {mtc-short} web console must have network access to the OAuth authorization server.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} cluster on which you have installed {mtc-short}.
. Obtain the {mtc-short} web console URL by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get -n openshift-migration route/migration -o go-template='https://{{ .spec.host }}'
----
+
The output resembles the following: `\https://migration-openshift-migration.apps.cluster.openshift.com`.

. Launch a browser and navigate to the {mtc-short} web console.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you try to access the {mtc-short} web console immediately after installing the {mtc-full} Operator, the console might not load because the Operator is still configuring the cluster. Wait a few minutes and retry.
====

. If you are using self-signed CA certificates, you will be prompted to accept the CA certificate of the source cluster API server. The web page guides you through the process of accepting the remaining certificates.

. Log in with your {product-title} *username* and *password*.
