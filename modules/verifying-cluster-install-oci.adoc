= Verifying a succesful cluster installation on OCI

Verify that your cluster was installed and is running effectively on {oci-first}. To succesfully install a cluster and deploy it on {oci-first}, you must create specific {oci} infrastucture resources. Additionally, you must ensure that the Assisted Installer can access these {oci} infrastucture resources.

.Prerequisites

* You completed all the Assisted Installer steps for installing a cluster on {oci}.

.Procedure

. From the Hybrid Cloud Console, go to **Clusters > Assisted Clusters** and select your clusterâ€™s name. 

. Check that the **Installation progress** bar is at **100%** and a message opens that indicates `Installation completed successfully`.

. To access the {product-title} web console, click on the provided Web Console URL.

. Go to **Compute > Nodes**. 

. Locate your node from the **Nodes** table. 

. From the **Overview** tab, check that your node has a `Ready` status. 

. Click the **YAML** tab.

. Check the `Labels` key, and verify that the listed labels apply to your configuration. For example, the `topology.kubernetes.io/region=us-sanjose-1` key indicates in what {oci} region the node was deployed.

.Next steps

* If the previous verification checks determine that your cluster failed to install on {oci}, see the "Troubleshooting installation of a cluster on OCI" section.
