= Creating and configuring access to EFS volumes in AWS

This procedure explains how to create and configure EFS volumes in AWS so that you can use them in {product-title}.

.Prerequisites

* AWS account credentials

.Procedure

To create and configure access to an EFS volume in AWS:

. On the AWS console, open https://console.aws.amazon.com/efs.

. Click *Create file system*:
+
* Enter a name for the file system.

* For *Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)*, select your {product-title}'s' virtual private cloud (VPC).

* Accept default settings for all other selections.

. Wait for the volume and mount targets to finish being fully created:

.. Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/efs#/file-systems.

.. Click your volume, and on the *Network* tab wait for all mount targets to become available (~1-2 minutes).

. On the *Network* tab, copy the Security Group ID (you will need this in the next step).

. Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home#SecurityGroups, and find the Security Group used by the EFS volume.

. On the *Inbound rules* tab, click *Edit inbound rules*, and then add a new rule with the following settings to allow {product-title} nodes to access EFS volumes :
+
* *Type*: NFS

* *Protocol*: TCP

* *Port range*: 2049

* *Source*: Custom/IP address range of your nodes (for example: “10.0.0.0/16”)
+
This step allows {product-title} to use NFS ports from the cluster.

. Save the rule.
