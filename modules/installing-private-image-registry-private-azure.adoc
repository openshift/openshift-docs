= Optional: Preparing a private Microsoft Azure cluster for a private image registry

By installing a private image registry on a private Microsoft Azure cluster, you can create private storage endpoints. Private storage endpoints disable public facing endpoints to the registry's storage account, adding an extra layer of security to your {product-title} deployment.
Use the following guide to prepare your private Microsoft Azure cluster for installation with a private image registry.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} account with cluster administrator access.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

* You have prepared an `install-config.yaml` that includes the following information:
** The `publish` field is set to `Internal`

* You have set the permissions for creating a private storage endpoint. For more information, see "Azure permissions for installer-provisioned infrastructure".

.Procedure

. If you have not previously created installation manifest files, do so by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
----
+
This command displays the following messages:
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
INFO Consuming Install Config from target directory
INFO Manifests created in: <installation_directory>/manifests and <installation_directory>/openshift
----

. Create an image registry configuration object and pass in the `networkResourceGroupName`, `subnetName`, and `vnetName` provided by Microsoft Azure. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ touch imageregistry-config.yaml
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Config
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  managementState: "Managed"
  replicas: 2
  rolloutStrategy: RollingUpdate
  storage:
    azure:
      networkAccess:
        internal:
          networkResourceGroupName: <vnet_resource_group> <1>
          subnetName: <subnet_name> <2>
          vnetName: <vnet_name> <3>
        type: Internal 
----
<1> Optional. If you have an existing VNet and subnet setup, replace `<vnet_resource_group>` with the resource group name that contains the existing virtual network (VNet).
<2> Optional. If you have an existing VNet and subnet setup, replace `<subnet_name>` with the name of the existing compute subnet within the specified resource group.
<3> Optional. If you have an existing VNet and subnet setup, replace `<vnet_name>` with the name of the existing virtual network (VNet) in the specified resource group.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `imageregistry-config.yaml` file is consumed during the installation process. If desired, you must back it up before installation.
====

. Move the `imageregistry-config.yaml` file to the `<installation_directory/manifests>` folder by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mv imageregistry-config.yaml <installation_directory/manifests/>
----

.Next steps

* After you have moved the `imageregistry-config.yaml` file to the `<installation_directory/manifests>` folder and set the required permissions, proceed to "Deploying the cluster".
