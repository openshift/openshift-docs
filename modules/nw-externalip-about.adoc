= About ExternalIP

For non-cloud environments, {product-title} supports the assignment of external IP addresses to a `Service` object `spec.externalIPs[]` field through the *ExternalIP* facility.
By setting this field, {product-title} assigns an additional virtual IP address to the service. The IP address can be outside the service network defined for the cluster.
A service configured with an ExternalIP functions similarly to a service with `type=NodePort`, allowing you to direct traffic to a local node for load balancing.

You must configure your networking infrastructure to ensure that the external IP address blocks that you define are routed to the cluster. As a result, the IP address is not configured in the network interfaces from nodes. To handle the traffic, you must configure the routing and access to the external IP by using a method such as static Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) entries.

{product-title} extends the ExternalIP functionality in Kubernetes by adding the following capabilities:

- Restrictions on the use of external IP addresses by users through a configurable policy
- Allocation of an external IP address automatically to a service upon request

[WARNING]
====
Disabled by default, use of ExternalIP functionality can be a security risk, because in-cluster traffic to an external IP address is directed to that service.
This could allow cluster users to intercept sensitive traffic destined for external resources.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
This feature is supported only in non-cloud deployments.
For cloud deployments, use the load balancer services for automatic deployment of a cloud load balancer to target the endpoints of a service.
====

You can assign an external IP address in the following ways:

Automatic assignment of an external IP::
{product-title} automatically assigns an IP address from the `autoAssignCIDRs` CIDR block to the `spec.externalIPs[]` array when you create a `Service` object with `spec.type=LoadBalancer` set.
In this case, {product-title} implements a non-cloud version of the load balancer service type and assigns IP addresses to the services.
Automatic assignment is disabled by default and must be configured by a cluster administrator as described in the following section.

Manual assignment of an external IP::
{product-title} uses the IP addresses assigned to the `spec.externalIPs[]` array when you create a `Service` object. You cannot specify an IP address that is already in use by another service.

[id="configuration-externalip_{context}"]
== Configuration for ExternalIP

Use of an external IP address in {product-title} is governed by the following fields in the `Network.config.openshift.io` CR named `cluster`:

* `spec.externalIP.autoAssignCIDRs` defines an IP address block used by the load balancer when choosing an external IP address for the service. {product-title} supports only a single IP address block for automatic assignment. This can be simpler than having to manage the port space of a limited number of shared IP addresses when manually assigning ExternalIPs to services. If automatic assignment is enabled, a `Service` object with `spec.type=LoadBalancer` is allocated an external IP address.
* `spec.externalIP.policy` defines the permissible IP address blocks when manually specifying an IP address. {product-title} does not apply policy rules to IP address blocks defined by `spec.externalIP.autoAssignCIDRs`.

If routed correctly, external traffic from the configured external IP address block can reach service endpoints through any TCP or UDP port that the service exposes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
As a cluster administrator, you must configure routing to externalIPs on both OpenShiftSDN and OVN-Kubernetes network types. You must also ensure that the IP address block you assign terminates at one or more nodes in your cluster. For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#external-ips[*Kubernetes External IPs*].
====

{product-title} supports both the automatic and manual assignment of IP
addresses, and each address is guaranteed to be assigned to a maximum of one
service. This ensures that each service can expose its chosen ports regardless
of the ports exposed by other services.

[NOTE]
====
To use IP address blocks defined by `autoAssignCIDRs` in {product-title}, you must configure the necessary IP address assignment and routing for your host network.
====

The following YAML describes a service with an external IP address configured:

[id="restrictions-on-ip-assignment_{context}"]
== Restrictions on the assignment of an external IP address

As a cluster administrator, you can specify IP address blocks to allow and to reject.

Restrictions apply only to users without `cluster-admin` privileges. A cluster administrator can always set the service `spec.externalIPs[]` field to any IP address.

You configure IP address policy with a `policy` object defined by specifying the `spec.ExternalIP.policy` field.
The policy object has the following shape:

[source,json]
----
{
  "policy": {
    "allowedCIDRs": [],
    "rejectedCIDRs": []
  }
}
----

When configuring policy restrictions, the following rules apply:

- If `policy={}` is set, then creating a `Service` object with `spec.ExternalIPs[]` set will fail. This is the default for {product-title}. The behavior when `policy=null` is set is identical.
- If `policy` is set and either `policy.allowedCIDRs[]` or `policy.rejectedCIDRs[]` is set, the following rules apply:

* If `allowedCIDRs[]` and `rejectedCIDRs[]` are both set, then `rejectedCIDRs[]` has precedence over `allowedCIDRs[]`.
* If `allowedCIDRs[]` is set, creating a `Service` object with `spec.ExternalIPs[]` will succeed only if the specified IP addresses are allowed.
* If `rejectedCIDRs[]` is set, creating a `Service` object with `spec.ExternalIPs[]` will succeed only if the specified IP addresses are not rejected.

== Example policy objects

The examples that follow demonstrate several different policy configurations.

- In the following example, the policy prevents {product-title} from creating any service with an external IP address specified:
