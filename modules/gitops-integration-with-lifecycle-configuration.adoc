= Integration with legacy configuration

[role="_abstract"]
The Argo CD Operator recognizes users defined in the `extraConfig` section of the Argo CD custom resource (CR). Tokens defined for these users are not managed by the Operator. This behavior allows you to gradually migrate from manually-managed users to Operator-managed users.

spec:
  extraConfig:
    accounts.legacy-user: apiKey
  localUsers:
    - name: new-user
      apiKey: true

[IMPORTANT]
====
A user must be defined in only one section, either `extraConfig` or `localUsers`. If a user appears in both sections, the definition in `extraConfig` takes precedence and the definition in `localUsers` is ignored.
