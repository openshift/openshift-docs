= CSI snapshot controller and sidecar

{product-title} provides a snapshot controller that is deployed into the control plane. In addition, the csi-snapshotter sidecar is a helper container that is deployed along with the CSI driver for your CSI storage solution.

The CSI snapshot controller and sidecar provide volume snapshotting through the {product-title} API. These external components run in the cluster.

The external controller and sidecar services are deployed by the CSI Snapshot Controller Operator.

== External controller
The csi-snapshot-controller binds VolumeSnapshot and VolumeSnapshotContent objects. The controller manages dynamic provisioning by creating and deleting VolumeSnapshotContent objects.

== External sidecar
The csi-external-snapshotter sidecar manages new PVs from VolumeSnapshots by watching VolumeSnapshotContent objects, and then triggering CreateSnapshot and DeleteSnapshot operations against a CSI endpoint.

The csi-external-snapshotter sidecar is maintained by third-party CSI driver vendors. Follow the installation instructions provided by the CSI driver.
