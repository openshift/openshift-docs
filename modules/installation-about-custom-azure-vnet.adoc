= About reusing a VNet for your {product-title} cluster

In {product-title} {product-version}, you can deploy a cluster into an existing Azure Virtual Network (VNet) in Microsoft Azure. If you do, you must also use existing subnets within the VNet and routing rules.

By deploying {product-title} into an existing Azure VNet, you might be able to avoid service limit constraints in new accounts or more easily abide by the operational constraints that your company's guidelines set. This is a good option to use if you cannot obtain the infrastructure creation permissions that are required to create the VNet.

[id="installation-about-custom-azure-vnet-requirements_{context}"]
== Requirements for using your VNet

When you deploy a cluster by using an existing VNet, you must perform additional network configuration before you install the cluster. In installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters, the installer usually creates the following components, but it does not create them when you install into an existing VNet:

* Subnets
* Route tables
* VNets
* Network Security Groups

include::snippets/custom-dns-server.adoc[]

If you use a custom VNet, you must correctly configure it and its subnets for the installation program and the cluster to use. The installation program cannot subdivide network ranges for the cluster to use, set route tables for the subnets, or set VNet options like DHCP, so you must do so before you install the cluster.

The cluster must be able to access the resource group that contains the existing VNet and subnets. While all of the resources that the cluster creates are placed in a separate resource group that it creates, some network resources are used from a separate group. Some cluster Operators must be able to access resources in both resource groups. For example, the Machine API controller attaches NICS for the virtual machines that it creates to subnets from the networking resource group.

Your VNet must meet the following characteristics:

* The VNet's CIDR block must contain the `Networking.MachineCIDR` range, which is the IP address pool for cluster machines.
* The VNet and its subnets must belong to the same resource group, and the subnets must be configured to use Azure-assigned DHCP IP addresses instead of static IP addresses.

You must provide two subnets within your VNet, one for the control plane machines and one for the compute machines. Because Azure distributes machines in different availability zones within the region that you specify, your cluster will have high availability by default.

[NOTE]
====
By default, if you specify availability zones in the `install-config.yaml` file, the installation program distributes the control plane machines and the compute machines across link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/availability-zones/[these availability zones]
within link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/regions[a region]. To ensure high availability for your cluster, select a region with at least three availability zones. If your region contains fewer than three availability zones, the installation program places more than one control plane machine in the available zones.
====

To ensure that the subnets that you provide are suitable, the installation program confirms the following data:

* All the specified subnets exist.
* There are two private subnets, one for the control plane machines and one for the compute machines.
* The subnet CIDRs belong to the machine CIDR that you specified. Machines are not provisioned in availability zones that you do not provide private subnets for.
ifdef::azure[]
If required, the installation program creates public load balancers that manage the control plane and worker nodes, and Azure allocates a public IP address to them.
endif::[]

[NOTE]
====
If you destroy a cluster that uses an existing VNet, the VNet is not deleted.

[id="installation-about-custom-azure-vnet-nsg-requirements_{context}"]
=== Network security group requirements

The network security groups for the subnets that host the compute and control plane machines require specific access to ensure that the cluster communication is correct. You must create rules to allow access to the required cluster communication ports.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The network security group rules must be in place before you install the cluster. If you attempt to install a cluster without the required access, the installation program cannot reach the Azure APIs, and installation fails.

include::snippets/mcs-endpoint-limitation.adoc[]

Because cluster components do not modify the user-provided network security groups, which the Kubernetes controllers update, a pseudo-network security group is created for the Kubernetes controller to modify without impacting the rest of the environment.

[id="installation-about-custom-azure-permissions_{context}"]
== Division of permissions

Starting with {product-title} 4.3, you do not need all of the permissions that are required for an installation program-provisioned infrastructure cluster to deploy a cluster. This change mimics the division of permissions that you might have at your company: some individuals can create different resources in your clouds than others. For example, you might be able to create application-specific items, like instances, storage, and load balancers, but not networking-related components such as VNets, subnet, or ingress rules.

The Azure credentials that you use when you create your cluster do not need the networking permissions that are required to make VNets and core networking components within the VNet, such as subnets, routing tables, internet gateways, NAT, and VPN. You still need permission to make the application resources that the machines within the cluster require, such as load balancers, security groups, storage accounts, and nodes.

[id="installation-about-custom-azure-vnet-isolation_{context}"]
== Isolation between clusters

Because the cluster is unable to modify network security groups in an existing subnet, there is no way to isolate clusters from each other on the VNet.
////
These are some of the details from the AWS version, and if any of them are relevant to Azure, they can be included.
If you deploy {product-title} to an existing network, the isolation of cluster services is reduced in the following ways:

* You can install multiple {product-title} clusters in the same VNet.
* ICMP ingress is allowed to entire network.
* TCP 22 ingress (SSH) is allowed to the entire network.
* Control plane TCP 6443 ingress (Kubernetes API) is allowed to the entire network.
* Control plane TCP 22623 ingress (MCS) is allowed to the entire network.
