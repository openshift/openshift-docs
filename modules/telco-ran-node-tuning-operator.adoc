= Node Tuning Operator

New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
You tune the cluster performance by link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/scalability_and_performance/cnf-create-performance-profiles.html[creating a performance profile].
Settings that you configure with a performance profile include:
+
* Selecting the realtime or non-realtime kernel.

* Allocating cores to a reserved or isolated `cpuset`.
{product-title} processes allocated to the management workload partition are pinned to reserved set.

* Enabling kubelet features (CPU manager, topology manager, and memory manager).

* Configuring huge pages.

* Setting additional kernel arguments.

* Setting per-core power tuning and max CPU frequency.

Limits and requirements::

The Node Tuning Operator uses the `PerformanceProfile` CR to configure the cluster. You need to configure the following settings in the RAN DU profile `PerformanceProfile` CR:

* Select reserved and isolated cores and ensure that you allocate at least 4 hyperthreads (equivalent to 2 cores) on Intel 3rd Generation Xeon (Ice Lake) 2.20 GHz CPUs or better with firmware tuned for maximum performance.

* Set the reserved `cpuset` to include both hyperthread siblings for each included core.
Unreserved cores are available as allocatable CPU for scheduling workloads.
Ensure that hyperthread siblings are not split across reserved and isolated cores.

* Configure reserved and isolated CPUs to include all threads in all cores based on what you have set as reserved and isolated CPUs.

* Set core 0 of each NUMA node to be included in the reserved CPU set.

* Set the huge page size to 1G.

[NOTE]
====
You should not add additional workloads to the management partition.
Only those pods which are part of the OpenShift management platform should be annotated into the management partition.
====

Engineering considerations::
* You should use the RT kernel to meet performance requirements.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can use the non-RT kernel if required.
====

* The number of huge pages that you configure depends on the application workload requirements.
Variation in this parameter is expected and allowed.

* Variation is expected in the configuration of reserved and isolated CPU sets based on selected hardware and additional components in use on the system.
Variation must still meet the specified limits.

* Hardware without IRQ affinity support impacts isolated CPUs.
To ensure that pods with guaranteed whole CPU QoS have full use of the allocated CPU, all hardware in the server must support IRQ affinity.
For more information, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/scalability_and_performance/cnf-low-latency-tuning.html#about_irq_affinity_setting_cnf-master[About support of IRQ affinity setting].

[NOTE]
====
In {product-title} {product-version}, any `PerformanceProfile` CR configured on the cluster causes the Node Tuning Operator to automatically set all cluster nodes to use cgroup v1.

For more information about cgroups, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/nodes/clusters/nodes-cluster-cgroups-2.html#nodes-clusters-cgroups-2_nodes-cluster-cgroups-2[Configuring Linux cgroup].
