= Linking both components

Components running on the cluster need to be connected in order to interact. {product-title} provides linking mechanisms to publish communication bindings from a program to its clients.

.Procedure

. List all the components that are running on the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ odo list
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
OpenShift Components: 
APP     NAME         PROJECT     TYPE          SOURCETYPE     STATE
app     backend      testpro     openjdk18     binary         Pushed
app     frontend     testpro     nodejs        local          Pushed
----


. Link the current front-end component to the backend:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ odo link backend --port 8080
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
 âœ“  Component backend has been successfully linked from the component frontend

Following environment variables were added to frontend component:
- COMPONENT_BACKEND_HOST
- COMPONENT_BACKEND_PORT
----
+
The configuration information of the back-end component is added to the front-end component and the front-end component restarts.
