= Configuring HAProxy reload interval

When you update a route or an endpoint associated with a route, {product-title} router updates the configuration for HAProxy. Then, HAProxy reloads the updated configuration for those changes to take effect. When HAProxy reloads, it generates a new process that handles new connections using the updated configuration.

HAProxy keeps the old process running to handle existing connections until those connections are all closed. When old processes have long-lived connections, these processes can accumulate and consume resources.

The default minimum HAProxy reload interval is five seconds. You can configure an Ingress Controller using its `spec.tuningOptions.reloadInterval` field to set a longer minimum reload interval.

[WARNING]
====
Setting a large value for the minimum HAProxy reload interval can cause latency in observing updates to routes and their endpoints. To lessen the risk, avoid setting a value larger than the tolerable latency for updates. The maximum value for HAProxy reload interval is 120 seconds.

.Procedure

* Change the minimum HAProxy reload interval of the default Ingress Controller to 15 seconds by running the following command:
