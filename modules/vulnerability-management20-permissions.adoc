= Vulnerability report permissions

[role="_abstract"]
The ability to create, view, and download reports depends on the access control settings, or roles and permission sets, for your user account.

For example, you can only view, create, and download reports for data that your user account has permission to access. In addition, the following restrictions apply:

* You can only download reports that you have generated; you cannot download reports generated by other users.
* Report permissions are restricted depending on the access settings for user accounts. If the access settings for your account change, old reports do not reflect the change. For example, if you are given new permissions and want to view vulnerability data that is now allowed by those permissions, you must create a new vulnerability report.
