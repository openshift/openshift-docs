[id='migration-rolling-back-migration-cli_{context}']
== Rolling back a migration from the CLI

You can roll back a migration by using the CLI.

If your application was stopped during a failed migration, you must roll back the migration in order to prevent data corruption in the persistent volume.

Rollback is not required if the application was not stopped during migration because the original application is still running on the source cluster.

.Procedure

. Create a `MigMigration` CR object based on the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
$ cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: migration.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: MigMigration
metadata:
  labels:
    controller-tools.k8s.io: "1.0"
  name: migration-rollback
  namespace: openshift-migration
spec:
  # 'canceled: true' cancels the migration
  canceled: false
  # 'rollback: true' rolls back the migration
  rollback: true
  # 'stage: true' runs a stage migration without quiescing the application on the source cluster.
  stage: false
  # 'quiescePods: true' scales the pods on the source cluster to '0' after the 'Backup' stage of a migration has finished
  quiescePods: false
  # 'keepAnnotations: true' retains the labels and annotations applied by the migration
  keepAnnotations: false

  migPlanRef:
    name: <migplan-name> <1>
    namespace: openshift-migration
EOF
----
<1> Specify the name of the migration plan that you want to roll back.

. In the {mtc-short} console, verify that the migrated project resources have been removed from the target cluster.
. Verify that the migrated project resources are present in the source cluster and that the application is running.
