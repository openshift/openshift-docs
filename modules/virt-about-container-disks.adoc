= About container disks

A container disk is a virtual machine image that is stored as a container image in a container image registry. You can use container disks to deliver the same disk images to multiple virtual machines and to create large numbers of virtual machine clones.

A container disk can either be imported into a persistent volume claim (PVC) by using a data volume that is attached to a virtual machine, or attached directly to a virtual machine as an ephemeral `containerDisk` volume.

== Importing a container disk into a PVC by using a data volume

Use the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) to import the container disk into a PVC by using a data volume. You can then attach the data volume to a virtual machine for persistent storage.

== Attaching a container disk to a virtual machine as a `containerDisk` volume

A `containerDisk` volume is ephemeral. It is discarded when the virtual machine is stopped, restarted, or deleted. When a virtual machine with a `containerDisk` volume starts, the container image is pulled from the registry and hosted on the node that is hosting the virtual machine.

Use `containerDisk` volumes for read-only file systems such as CD-ROMs or for disposable virtual machines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Using `containerDisk` volumes for read-write file systems is not recommended because the data is temporarily written to local storage on the hosting node. This slows live migration of the virtual machine, such as in the case of node maintenance, because the data must be migrated to the destination node. Additionally, all data is lost if the node loses power or otherwise shuts down unexpectedly.
