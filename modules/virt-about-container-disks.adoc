= About container disks 

A container disk is a virtual machine image stored as a container image in a container image registry. Container disks can deliver the same disk images to multiple virtual machines and can be used to create large numbers of virtual machine clones.

A container disk can either be imported into a DataVolume and attached to a virtual machine or attached directly to a virtual machine as an ephemeral `containerDisk` volume.

== Importing container disks into DataVolumes

The Containerized Data Importer (CDI) imports the container disk into a DataVolume with an underlying PersistentVolumeClaim. The DataVolume can then be attached to a virtual machine for persistent storage.

== Attaching a container disk to a virtual machine as a containerDisk volume

A containerDisk volume is ephemeral. It is discarded when
the virtual machine is stopped, restarted, or deleted. When a virtual machine with a containerDisk volume starts, the container image is pulled from the registry and hosted on the node that is hosting the virtual machine.

A containerDisk volume is useful for read-only filesystems such as CD-ROMs or for disposable virtual machines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Container disks are not recommended for read-write filesystems as
the data is temporarily written to local storage on the hosting node. This slows
live migration of the virtual machine, such as in the case of node maintenance,
because the data must be migrated to the destination node. Additionally,
all data is lost if the node loses power or otherwise shuts down unexpectedly.
