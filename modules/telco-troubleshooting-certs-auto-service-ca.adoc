= Service CA certificates

The `service-ca` is an Operator that creates a self-signed certificate authority (CA) when an {product-title} cluster is deployed.
This allows user to add certificates to their deployments without manually creating them. 
Service CA certificates are self-signed certificates.

For more information, see "Service CA certificates" in _Security and compliance_.
