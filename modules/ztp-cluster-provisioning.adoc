= Cluster provisioning

Zero touch provisioning (ZTP) provisions clusters using a layered approach. The base components consist of {op-system-first}, the basic operating system
for the cluster, and {product-title}. After these components are installed, the worker node can join the existing cluster. When the node has joined the existing cluster, the 5G RAN profile Operators are applied.

The following diagram illustrates this architecture.

The following RAN Operators are deployed on every cluster:

* Machine Config
* Precision Time Protocol (PTP)
* Performance Addon Operator
* SR-IOV
* Local Storage Operator
* Logging Operator
