= Kickstart files for embedding {microshift-short} with a {op-system-base} installation

By using a Kickstart file, you automate a typical {op-system-base-full} installation by creating a single file containing all of the information required for success.

* You can also automate your {microshift-short} installation by including {microshift-short} in the Kickstart file for the {op-system-base} type that you choose.
* You can use a Kickstart file to provision virtual machines (VMs) or to complete a regular {op-system-base} installation for deployment on edge devices.

For {microshift-short}, your Kickstart file must include information to provision the {op-system-base} system to meet the following requirements:

* A {op-system-base} system you provision must meet the requirements for installing {microshift-short}.
* The {op-system-base} file system must have a logical volume manager (LVM) volume group (VG) with sufficient capacity for the persistent volumes (PVs) of your workload.
* A pull secret from the https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console] must be present as `/etc/crio/openshift-pull-secret` and have root user-only read/write permissions.
