. Before you push the images into the registry, re-tag each image.
** For images in the `openshift4` repository, tag the image as both the major and minor version number. For example, to tag the {product-title} node image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ docker tag registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-node:<tag> registry.example.com/openshift3/ose-node:<tag>
$ docker tag registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-node:<tag> registry.example.com/openshift3/ose-node:{major-tag}
----
** For other images, tag the image with the exact version number. For example, to tag the etcd image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ docker tag registry.redhat.io/rhel7/etcd:3.2.28 registry.example.com/rhel7/etcd:3.2.28
----

. Push each image into the registry. For example, to push the {product-title} node images:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ docker push registry.example.com/openshift4/ose-node:<tag>
$ docker push registry.example.com/openshift4/ose-node:{major-tag}
