= Creating an API key

You must create a user API key or a service ID API key for your IBM Cloud account.

.Prerequisites

* You have assigned the required access policies to your IBM Cloud account.
* You have attached you IAM access policies to an access group, or other appropriate resource.

.Procedure

* Create an API key, depending on how you defined your IAM access policies.
+
For example, if you assigned your access policies to a user, you must create a link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey[user API key]. If you assigned your access policies to a service ID, you must create a link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-serviceidapikeys[service ID API key]. If your access policies are assigned to an access group, you can use either API key type.
