[id="meaning-vmstorageclasswarning"]
== Meaning

This alert fires when the storage class is incorrectly configured.
A system-wide, shared dummy page causes CRC errors when data is
written and read across different processes or threads.

[id="impact-vmstorageclasswarning"]
== Impact

A large number of CRC errors might cause the cluster to display
severe performance degradation.

== Diagnosis

. Navigate to *Observe* -> *Metrics* in the web console.
. Obtain a list of virtual machines with incorrectly configured storage classes
by running the following PromQL query:
+
[source,text]
----
kubevirt_ssp_vm_rbd_volume{rxbounce_enabled="false", volume_mode="Block"} == 1
----
+
The output displays a list of virtual machines that use a storage
class without `rxbounce_enabled`.
+
.Example output
+
[source,text]
----
kubevirt_ssp_vm_rbd_volume{name="testvmi-gwgdqp22k7", namespace="test_ns", pv_name="testvmi-gwgdqp22k7", rxbounce_enabled="false", volume_mode="Block"} 1
----

. Obtain the storage class name by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pv <pv_name> -o=jsonpath='{.spec.storageClassName}'

== Mitigation

Create a default OpenShift Virtualization storage class with the `krbd:rxbounce` map option. See  link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6978371[Optimizing ODF PersistentVolumes for Windows VMs] for details.

If you cannot resolve the issue, log in to the
link:https://access.redhat.com[Customer Portal] and open a support case,
attaching the artifacts gathered during the diagnosis procedure.
