New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
{rh-rhacm-first} provides Multi Cluster Engine (MCE) installation and ongoing lifecycle management functionality for deployed clusters.
You manage cluster configuration and upgrades declaratively by applying `Policy` custom resources (CRs) to clusters during maintenance windows.
+
You apply policies with the {rh-rhacm} policy controller as managed by {cgu-operator-first}.
The policy controller handles configuration, upgrades, and cluster statuses.
+
When installing managed clusters, {rh-rhacm} applies labels and initial ignition configuration to individual nodes in support of custom disk partitioning, allocation of roles, and allocation to machine config pools.
You define these configurations with `SiteConfig` or `ClusterInstance` CRs.

Limits and requirements::
* 300 `SiteConfig` CRs per ArgoCD application.
You can use multiple applications to achieve the maximum number of clusters supported by a single hub cluster.
* A single hub cluster supports up to 3500 deployed {sno} clusters with 5 `Policy` CRs bound to each cluster.

Engineering considerations::
* Use {rh-rhacm} policy hub-side templating to better scale cluster configuration.
You can significantly reduce the number of policies by using a single group policy or small number of general group policies where the group and per-cluster values are substituted into templates.

* Cluster specific configuration: managed clusters typically have some number of configuration values that are specific to the individual cluster.
These configurations should be managed using {rh-rhacm} policy hub-side templating with values pulled from `ConfigMap` CRs based on the cluster name.

* To save CPU resources on managed clusters, policies that apply static configurations should be unbound from managed clusters after {ztp} installation of the cluster.
