New in this release::
* No reference design updates in this release

Description::
{rh-rhacm} provides Multi Cluster Engine (MCE) installation and ongoing lifecycle management functionality for deployed clusters.
You declaratively specify configurations and upgrades with `Policy` CRs and apply the policies to clusters with the {rh-rhacm} policy controller as managed by {cgu-operator-full}.
+
--
* {ztp-first} uses the MCE feature of {rh-rhacm}
* Configuration, upgrades, and cluster status are managed with the {rh-rhacm} policy controller

During installation {rh-rhacm} can apply labels to individual nodes as configured in the `SiteConfig` custom resource (CR).
--

Limits and requirements::
* A single hub cluster supports up to 3500 deployed {sno} clusters with 5 `Policy` CRs bound to each cluster.

Engineering considerations::
* Use {rh-rhacm} policy hub-side templating to better scale cluster configuration.
You can significantly reduce the number of policies by using a single group policy or small number of general group policies where the group and per-cluster values are substituted into templates.

* Cluster specific configuration: managed clusters typically have some number of configuration values that are specific to the individual cluster.
These configurations should be managed using {rh-rhacm} policy hub-side templating with values pulled from `ConfigMap` CRs based on the cluster name.

* To save CPU resources on managed clusters, policies that apply static configurations should be unbound from managed clusters after {ztp} installation of the cluster.
