== Bug fixes
* Before this update, the log file size map generated by the `log-file-metrics-exporter` component did not remove entries for deleted files, resulting in increased file size, and process memory. With this update, the log file size map does not contain entries for deleted files. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3293[LOG-3293])
