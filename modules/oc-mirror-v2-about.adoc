= About oc-mirror plugin version 2
You can use the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (`oc`) plugin as a single tool to mirror all required {product-title} content and other images to your mirror registry.

To use oc-mirror, add the `--v2` flag to the oc-mirror command line. The new tool is is available as a Tech Preview feature. 

oc-mirror version 2 (V2) provides the following features:

* Verifies that the complete image set specified in the image set config is mirrored to the mirrored registry, regardless of whether the images were previously mirrored or not.

* Uses a cache system instead of metadata.

* Maintains minimal archive sizes by incorporating only new images into the archive.

* Generate mirroring archives with content selected by mirroring date.

* Can generate IDMS and ITMS (instead of ICSP) for the full image set, rather than just the incremental changes.

* Filter Operator versions by bundle name.

* Does not perform automatic pruning; instead, it introduces a `Delete` feature, granting users more control over the image deletion.

* Introduces support for `registries.conf`, facilitating mirroring to multiple enclaves using the same cache.
