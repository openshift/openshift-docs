= About the oc-mirror plugin V2

You can use the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (`oc`) plugin to mirror all required {product-title} content and other images to your mirror registry by using a single tool. 

It provides the following features:

* Provides a centralized method to mirror {product-title} releases, Operators, and other images.
* Uses a declarative image set configuration file to include only the {product-title} releases, Operators, and images that your cluster needs.
* Performs incremental mirroring, which reduces the size of future image sets.
* Optionally generates supporting artifacts for OpenShift Update Service (OSUS) usage.
* Use the existing workflow use case/s (as in v1)
- Mirror to Disk
- Disk to Mirror
- Mirror to Mirror
* Improve overall user experience
* Support multi tier complex enclaves 
- Partial or fully air-gapped
- Hub and spoke type air-gapped environments
- Generate archives (tar.gz diff)
-- By time (i.e from first mirror to latest)
-- Incremental
- History metadata
* OCI FBC support 
* Filtering of operators by selecting bundles 
* Generate all relevant metadata 
- IDMS - ImageDigestMirrorSet
- ITMS - ImageTagMirrorSet
- CatalogSource
- Use of templating
* Implement delete functionality
- Use of DeleteImageSetConfig (kind)
- Delete images from remote registries
- Delete images from local cache

When using the oc-mirror plugin, you specify which content to mirror in an image set configuration file. In this YAML file, you can fine-tune the configuration to only include the {product-title} releases and Operators that your cluster needs. This reduces the amount of data that you need to download and transfer.

The first time you run the oc-mirror plugin, it populates your mirror registry with the required content to perform your disconnected cluster installation or update. In order for your disconnected cluster to continue receiving updates, you must keep your mirror registry updated. To update your mirror registry, you run the oc-mirror plugin using the same configuration as the first time you ran it. The oc-mirror plugin references the metadata from the storage backend and only downloads what has been released since the last time you ran the tool. This provides update paths for {product-title} and Operators and performs dependency resolution as required.

With v2, you don't need to use the same `imagesetconfig` or the same metadata from the storage backend. You can have as many imagesetconfigs as you want, even targeting different registries. The constraint of maintaining the same `imagesetconfig`, storage backend, and destination registry is no longer relevant in v2. The cache enables oc-mirror to download only what is missing in the destination registry, rather than what is new compared to the last run.
