= About oc-mirror plugin v2

The oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (`oc`) plugin is a single tool that mirrors all required {product-title} content and other images to your mirror registry.

To use the new Technology Preview version of oc-mirror, add the `--v2` flag to the oc-mirror plugin v2 command line.

oc-mirror plugin v2 has the following features:

* Verifies that the complete image set specified in the image set config is mirrored to the mirrored registry, regardless of whether the images were previously mirrored or not.

* Uses a cache system instead of metadata.

* Maintains minimal archive sizes by incorporating only new images into the archive.

* Generates mirroring archives with content selected by mirroring date.

* Can generate `ImageDigestMirrorSet` (IDMS), `ImageTagMirrorSet` (ITMS), instead of `ImageContentSourcePolicy` (ICSP) for the full image set, rather than just for the incremental changes.

* Saves filter Operator versions by bundle name.

* Does not perform automatic pruning. V2 now has a `Delete` feature, which grants users more control over deleting images.

* Introduces support for `registries.conf`. This change facilitates mirroring to multiple enclaves while using the same cache.
