= Optional: Configuring address generation modes for SLAAC in dual-stack networks

For dual-stack clusters that use Stateless Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC), you must specify a global value for the `ipv6.addr-gen-mode` network setting. You can set this value using NMState to configure the RAM disk and the cluster configuration files. If you do not configure a consistent `ipv6.addr-gen-mode` in these locations, IPv6 address mismatches can occur between CSR resources and `BareMetalHost` resources in the cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Install the NMState CLI (`nmstate`).

.Procedure

. Optional: Consider testing the NMState YAML syntax with the `nmstatectl gc` command before including it in the `install-config.yaml` file because the installation program will not check the NMState YAML syntax.

.. Create an NMState YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
interfaces:
- name: eth0
  ipv6:
    addr-gen-mode: <address_mode> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<address_mode>` with the type of address generation mode required for IPv6 addresses in the cluster. Valid values are `eui64`, `stable-privacy`, or `random`.

.. Test the configuration file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ nmstatectl gc <nmstate_yaml_file> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<nmstate_yaml_file>` with the name of the test configuration file.

. Add the NMState configuration to the `hosts.networkConfig` section within the install-config.yaml file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: redfish+http://<out_of_band_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
          disableCertificateVerification: null
        bootMACAddress: <NIC1_mac_address>
        bootMode: UEFI
        rootDeviceHints:
          deviceName: "/dev/sda"
        networkConfig:
          interfaces:
          - name: eth0
            ipv6:
              addr-gen-mode: <address_mode> <1>
...

----
<1> Replace `<address_mode>` with the type of address generation mode required for IPv6 addresses in the cluster. Valid values are `eui64`, `stable-privacy`, or `random`.
