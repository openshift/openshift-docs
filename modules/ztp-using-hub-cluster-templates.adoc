= Using hub templates in PolicyGenTemplate CRs

{cgu-operator-full} supports partial {rh-rhacm-first} hub cluster template functions in configuration policies used with {ztp-first}.

Hub-side cluster templates allow you to define configuration policies that can be dynamically customized to the target clusters.
This reduces the need to create separate policies for many clusters with similiar configurations but with different values.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Policy templates are restricted to the same namespace as the namespace where the policy is defined.
This means that you must create the objects referenced in the hub template in the same namespace where the policy is created.
====

The following supported hub template functions are available for use in {ztp} with {cgu-operator}:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.6/html-single/governance/index#fromConfigmap-func[`fromConfigmap`] returns the value of the provided data key in the named `ConfigMap` resource.

[NOTE]
====
There is a link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/#motivation[1 MiB size limit] for `ConfigMap` CRs.
The effective size for `ConfigMap` CRs is further limited by the `last-applied-configuration` annotation.
To avoid the `last-applied-configuration` limitation, add the following annotation to the template `ConfigMap`:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.6/html-single/governance/index#base64enc-func[`base64enc`] returns the base64-encoded value of the input string

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.6/html-single/governance/index#base64dec-func[`base64dec`] returns the decoded value of the base64-encoded input string

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.6/html-single/governance/index#autoindent-function[`autoindent`] returns the input string with added indent spaces based on the spacing used in the parent template

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.6/html-single/governance/index#toInt-function[`toInt`] casts and returns the integer value of the input value

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.6/html-single/governance/index#toBool-function[`toBool`] converts the input string into a boolean value, and returns the boolean

Various link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.6/html-single/governance/index#open-source-community-functions[Open source community functions] are also available for use with {ztp}.
