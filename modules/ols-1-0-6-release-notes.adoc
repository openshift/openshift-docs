== Enhancements

{ols-official} 1.0.6 provides the following enhancements:

* This release makes {ols-official} 1.0.6 generally available, and is supported on {ocp-product-title} 4.16 and later.

* When viewing the *Cluster Overview* page in the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes web console, you can attach the `ManagedCluster` and `ManagedClusterInfo` YAML using the *Attach* menu.

* This release introduces a check for the total size of all uploaded attachments. This is in addition to the existing check for individual attachment sizes. The check for total size helps prevent exceeding the context window size of the large language model (LLM) so that the model does not receive more text than it can process in a single request.
