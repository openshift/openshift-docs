= Restic issues

You might encounter these issues when you back up applications with Restic.

[id="restic-permission-error-nfs-root-squash-enabled_{context}"]
== Restic permission error for NFS data volumes with root_squash enabled

The `Restic` pod log displays the error message: `controller=pod-volume-backup error="fork/exec/usr/bin/restic: permission denied"`.

.Cause

If your NFS data volumes have `root_squash` enabled, `Restic` maps to `nfsnobody` and does not have permission to create backups.

.Solution

You can resolve this issue by creating a supplemental group for `Restic` and adding the group ID to the `DataProtectionApplication` manifest:

. Create a supplemental group for `Restic` on the NFS data volume.
. Set the `setgid` bit on the NFS directories so that group ownership is inherited.
. Add the `spec.configuration.restic.supplementalGroups` parameter and the group ID to the `DataProtectionApplication` manifest, as in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  configuration:
    restic:
      enable: true
      supplementalGroups:
      - <group_id> <1>
----
<1> Specify the supplemental group ID.

. Wait for the `Restic` pods to restart so that the changes are applied.

[id="restic-backup-cannot-be-recreated-after-s3-bucket-emptied_{context}"]
== Restic Backup CR cannot be recreated after bucket is emptied

If you create a Restic `Backup` CR for a namespace, empty the object storage bucket, and then recreate the `Backup` CR for the same namespace, the recreated `Backup` CR fails.

The `velero` pod log displays the following error message: `stderr=Fatal: unable to open config file: Stat: The specified key does not exist.\nIs there a repository at the following location?`.

.Cause

Velero does not recreate or update the Restic repository from the `ResticRepository` manifest if the Restic directories are deleted from object storage. See link:https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/issues/4421[Velero issue 4421] for more information.

.Solution

* Remove the related Restic repository from the namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete resticrepository openshift-adp <name_of_the_restic_repository>
----
+

In the following error log, `mysql-persistent` is the problematic Restic repository. The name of the repository appears in italics for clarity.
