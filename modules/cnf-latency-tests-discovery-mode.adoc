= About discovery mode for latency tests

Use discovery mode to validate the functionality of a cluster without altering its configuration. Existing environment configurations are used for the tests. The tests can find the configuration items needed and use those items to execute the tests. If resources needed to run a specific test are not found, the test is skipped, providing an appropriate message to the user. After the tests are finished, no cleanup of the pre-configured configuration items is done, and the test environment can be immediately used for another test run.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When running the latency tests, **always** run the tests with `-e DISCOVERY_MODE=true` and `-ginkgo.focus` set to the appropriate latency test. If you do not run the latency tests in discovery mode, your existing live cluster performance profile configuration will be modified by the test run.

=== Limiting the nodes used during tests

The nodes on which the tests are executed can be limited by specifying a `NODES_SELECTOR` environment variable, for example, `-e NODES_SELECTOR=node-role.kubernetes.io/worker-cnf`. Any resources created by the test are limited to nodes with matching labels.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to override the default worker pool, pass the `-e ROLE_WORKER_CNF=<custom_worker_pool>` variable to the command specifying an appropriate label.
