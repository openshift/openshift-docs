= Connecting to a Windows virtual machine with an RDP console

The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) provides a better console experience for
connecting to Windows virtual machines.

To connect to a Windows virtual machine with RDP, specify the IP address of the
attached L2 NIC to your RDP client.

.Prerequisites

* A running Windows virtual machine with the QEMU guest agent installed. The
`qemu-guest-agent` is included in the VirtIO drivers.
* A layer 2 NIC attached to the virtual machine. 
* An RDP client installed on a machine on the same network as the
Windows virtual machine.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {VirtProductName} cluster through the `oc` CLI tool as a user with
an access token.

----
$ oc login -u <user> https://<cluster.example.com>:8443
----

. Use `oc describe vmi` to display the configuration of the running
Windows virtual machine.

----
$ oc describe vmi <windows-vmi-name>

. Identify and copy the IP address of the layer 2 network interface. This is
`192.0.2.0` in the above example, or `2001:db8::` if you prefer IPv6.
. Open an RDP client and use the IP address copied in the previous step for the
connection.
. Enter the *Administrator* user name and password to connect to the
Windows virtual machine.
