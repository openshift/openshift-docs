=== Membership

* If more than one Operator group exists in a single namespace, any CSV created in that namespace transitions to a failure state with the reason `TooManyOperatorGroups`. CSVs in a failed state for this reason transition to pending after the number of Operator groups in their namespaces reaches one.
* If the install modes of a CSV do not support the target namespace selection of the Operator group in its namespace, the CSV transitions to a failure state with the reason `UnsupportedOperatorGroup`. CSVs in a failed state for this reason transition to pending after either the target namespace selection of the Operator group changes to a supported configuration, or the install modes of the CSV are modified to support the target namespace selection.
