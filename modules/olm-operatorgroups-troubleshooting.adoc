=== Membership

* If more than one OperatorGroup exists in a single namespace, any CSV created
in that namespace will transition to a failure state with the reason
`TooManyOperatorGroups`. CSVs in a failed state for this reason will
transition to pending once the number of OperatorGroups in their namespaces
reaches one.
* If a CSV's InstallModes do not support the target namespace selection of the
OperatorGroup in its namespace, the CSV will transition to a failure state
with the reason `UnsupportedOperatorGroup`. CSVs in a failed state for this
reason will transition to pending once either the OperatorGroup's target
namespace selection changes to a supported configuration, or the CSV's
InstallModes are modified to support the OperatorGroup's target namespace
selection.
