The following new features are available in this release:

* You can now collect logs that contain command-line information from `virt-launcher` pods. These logs serve as a centralized record of the JSON-encoded command-line options used to start virtual machines. You can use this data to troubleshoot and analyze virtual machine startup issues. This feature is backported to specific {product-title} versions. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-61775[OCPBUGS-61775])
