= Deleting the {pipelines-shortname} Custom Resources

If the Custom Resources (CRs) for the optional components, `TektonHub` and `TektonResult`, exist, delete these CRs. Then delete the `TektonConfig` CR.

.Procedure
. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, navigate to *Administration* -> *CustomResourceDefinitions*.

. Type `TektonHub` in the *Filter by name* field to search for the `TektonHub` Custom Resource Definition (CRD).

. Click the name of the `TektonHub` CRD to display the details page for the CRD.

. Click the `Instances` tab.

. If an instance is displayed, click the *Options* menu {kebab} for the displayed instance.

. Select *Delete TektonHub*.

. Click *Delete* to confirm the deletion of the CR.

. Repeat these steps, searching for `TektonResult` and then `TektonConfig` in the *Filter by name* box. If any instances are found for these CRDs, delete these instances.

[NOTE]
====
Deleting the CRs also deletes the {pipelines-title} components and all the tasks and pipelines on the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you uninstall the Operator without removing the `TektonHub` and `TektonResult` CRs, you cannot remove the {tekton-hub} and {tekton-results} components later.
