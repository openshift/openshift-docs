= Getting CRI-O
CRI-O is not supported as a stand-alone container engine.
You must use CRI-O as a container engine for a Kubernetes
installation, such as {product-title}. To run containers without Kubernetes
or {product-title}, use link:https://github.com/containers/libpod/tree/master/cmd/podman[podman].

To set up a CRI-O
container engine to use with an {product-title} cluster, you can:

* Install CRI-O along with a new {product-title} cluster or
* Add a node to an existing cluster and identify CRI-O as the container engine for
that node. Both CRI-O and Docker nodes can exist on the same cluster.

The following section describes how to install CRI-O with a new {product-title} cluster

== Installing CRI-O with a new {product-title} cluster
You can choose CRI-O as the container engine for your {product-title} nodes on
a per-node basis at install time. Here are a few things you should
know about enabling the CRI-O container engine when you install {product-title}:

* Previously, using CRI-O on your nodes required that the Docker container engine be
available as well. As of
{product-title} 3.10 and later, the Docker container engine is no longer required in all cases. Now you can now have
CRI-O-only nodes in your {product-title} cluster. However, nodes that do build and push operations still
need to have the Docker container engine installed along with CRI-O.

* Enabling CRI-O using a CRI-O container is no longer supported. An
rpm-based installation of CRI-O is required.

The following procedure assumes you are installing {product-title} using Ansible
inventory files, such as those described in
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html-single/installing_clusters/#install-config-configuring-inventory-file[Configuring Your Inventory File].

[NOTE]
====
Do not set `/var/lib/docker` as a separate mount point for an {product-title} node
using CRI-O as its container engine. When deploying a CRI-O node, the installer tries
to make `/var/lib/docker` a symbolic link to `/var/lib/containers`. That action
will fail because it won't be able to remove the existing `/var/lib/docker` to
create the symbolic link.
====

. With the {product-title} Ansible playbooks installed, edit the appropriate
inventory file to enable CRI-O.

. Locate CRI-O setting in your selected inventory file. To have the CRI-O
container engine installed on your nodes during {product-title} installation, locate the
[OSEv3:vars] section of an Ansible inventory file.
A section of CRI-O settings might include the following:
+
```
[OSEv3:vars]
...
# Install and run cri-o.
#openshift_use_crio=False
#openshift_use_crio_only=False
# The following two variables are used when openshift_use_crio is True
# and cleans up after builds that pass through docker. When openshift_use_crio is True
# these variables are set to the defaults shown. You may override them here.
# NOTE: You will still need to tag crio nodes with your given label(s)!
# Enable docker garbage collection when using cri-o
#openshift_crio_enable_docker_gc=True
# Node Selectors to run the garbage collection
#openshift_crio_docker_gc_node_selector={'runtime': 'cri-o'}
```

. Enable CRI-O settings. You can decide to either enable CRI-O alone or CRI-O
alongside Docker. The following settings allow CRI-O and Docker as your node
container engines and enables Docker garbage collection on nodes with overlay2 storage:

+
[NOTE]
====
To be able to build containers on CRI-O nodes, you must have the Docker
container engine installed. If you want to have CRI-O-only nodes, you can do
that and simply designate other nodes to do container builds.
====

+
```
[OSEv3:vars]
...
openshift_use_crio=True
openshift_use_crio_only=False
openshift_crio_enable_docker_gc=True
```

. Set the openshift_node_group_name for each node to a configmap that configures
the kubelet for the CRI-O runtime. There's a corresponding CRI-O configmap for
all the default node groups. xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-inventory-defining-node-group-and-host-mappings[Defining Node Groups and Host Mappings]
covers node groups and mappings in detail.


+
```
[nodes]
ocp-crio01 openshift_node_group_name='node-config-all-in-one-crio'
ocp-docker01 openshift_node_group_name='node-config-all-in-one'
```

The resulting {product-title} configuration will be running the CRI-O container engine on
the nodes of your {product-title} installation.
Use the `oc` command to check the status of the nodes and identify the nodes running CRI-O:

```
$ oc get nodes -o wide
NAME         STATUS  ROLES                  AGE  ...   CONTAINER-RUNTIME
ocp-crio01   Ready   compute,infra,master   16d  ...   cri-o://1.11.5
ocp-docker01 Ready   compute,infra,master   16d  ...   docker://1.13.1
```
