= Viewing {sandboxed-containers-first} workloads from the web console

{sandboxed-containers-first} based workloads look and feel the same as normal workloads when viewed in the web console. The only difference between the two is the `runtimeClassName`. `runtimeClassName` is what decides the runtime used for workloads. In this context, the runtime enabled by {sandboxed-containers-first}-based is `kata`. You can view the `runtimeClass` that the pods for your workloads use.

.Prerequisites

* You have {product-title} {product-version} installed on your cluster.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Administration* -> *Workloads*.

. Identify the type of workload you want to view details for. For example, `Pod`, `Deployment`, `DeploymentConfigs` objects and so on.

. Choose the corresponding workload from the list.

. On the *Details* page, navigate to `runtimeClass`.

. Hover over `runtimeClass` to view more information. If `kata` was used as the runtime, the value of the `runtimeClass` is `kata`.
