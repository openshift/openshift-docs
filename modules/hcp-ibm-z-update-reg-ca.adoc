= Update the registry certificate authority in the AgentServiceConfig resource with the mirror registry

When you use a mirror registry for images, agents need to trust the registry's certificate to securely pull images. You can add the certificate authority of the mirror registry to the `AgentServiceConfig` custom resource by creating a `ConfigMap`.

.Prerequisites

* You must have installed {mce}.

.Procedure

. In the same namespace where you installed {mce-short}, create a `ConfigMap` resource with the mirror registry details. This `ConfigMap` resource ensures that you grant the hosted cluster workers the capability to retrieve images from the mirror registry.

. Patch the `AgentServiceConfig` resource to include the `ConfigMap` resource that you created. If the `AgentServiceConfig` resource is not present, create the `AgentServiceConfig` resource with the following content embedded into it:
