[id="microshift-low-latency-blueprint-rhel-edge-rtk_{context}"]
= Reference blueprint for installing {op-system-rt-kernel} in a {op-system-ostree} image

An image blueprint is a persistent definition of the required image customizations that enable you to create multiple builds. Instead of reconfiguring the blueprint for each image build, you can edit, rebuild, delete, and save the blueprint so that you can keep rebuilding images from it.

.Example blueprint used to install the real-time kernel in a {op-system-ostree} image
