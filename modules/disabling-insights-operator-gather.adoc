= Disabling the Insights Operator periodic gather operations 


[role="_abstract"]
You can optionally disable the periodic `InsightsDataGather` operations that the Insights Operator runs every 2 hours by default. Disabling the periodic data gather operations increases privacy for your organization as Insights Operator will no longer gather and send Insights cluster reports to Red{nbsp}Hat. 

Disabling gather operations will also disable Insights analysis and recommendations for your cluster without affecting other core functions that require communication with Red{nbsp}Hat such as cluster transfers. 

You can view a list of attempted gather operations for your cluster from the `/insights-operator/gathers.json` file in your Insights Operator archive. Be aware that some gather operations occur only when certain conditions are met and might not show in your most recent archive.

[NOTE]
====
If you enable Technology Preview in your cluster, the Insights Operator runs gather operations in individual pods. This is part of the Technology Preview feature set for the Insights Operator and supports the new data gathering features.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Administration* > *CustomResourceDefinitions*.
. On the *CustomResourceDefinitions* page, use the *Search by name* field to find the *InsightsDataGather* custom resource definition (CRD), and click to open.
. On the *CustomResourceDefinition details* page, click the *Instances* tab.
. Click *cluster*, and then click the *YAML* tab.
. Edit the `InsightsDataGather` CRD, and complete one of the following steps:
** To disable all the gather operations and data collection, define the `gatherers` specification and set the `mode` to *None* as outlined in the following example extract:
+
[source,yaml]
----

apiVersion: insights.openshift.io/v1alpha2
kind: InsightsDataGather
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
# Gatherers configuration
  gatherers:
    mode: None # Options: All, None, Custom
----
** To disable individual gather operations, under `gatherers`, set the `mode` to *Custom* and then specify the individual gatherer that you intend to disable. For example, to disable the workload gatherer, define the following specification:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: insights.openshift.io/v1alpha2
kind: InsightsDataGather
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
    # Gatherers configuration
  gatherers:
    mode: Custom  # Options: All, None, Custom
    custom:
      configs:
        # Essential cluster configuration gatherers
        - name: clusterconfig/authentication
          state: Enabled
        - name: clusterconfig/clusteroperators
          state: Enabled
        - name: workloads
          state: Disabled
----
. Click *Save*.

.Results

After you save the changes, the Insights Operator gather configurations are updated and the operations that you disabled in the configuration will no longer occur.

[NOTE]
====
Disabling gather operations restricts the ability of the Insights Advisor service to offer effective recommendations for your cluster.
