= Disabling the Insights Operator gather operations

You can disable the Insights Operator gather operations. Disabling the gather operations gives you the ability to increase privacy for your organization as Insights Operator will no longer gather and send Insights cluster reports to Red Hat. This will disable Insights analysis and recommendations for your cluster without affecting other core functions that require communication with Red Hat such as cluster transfers. You can view a list of attempted gather operations for your cluster from the `/insights-operator/gathers.json` file in your Insights Operator archive. Be aware that some gather operations only occur when certain conditions are met and might not appear in your most recent archive.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as a user with `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Administration* -> *CustomResourceDefinitions*.
. On the *CustomResourceDefinitions* page, use the *Search by name* field to find the *InsightsDataGather* resource definition and click it.
. On the *CustomResourceDefinition details* page, click the *Instances* tab.
. Click *cluster*, and then click the *YAML* tab.
. To disable all the gather operations, edit the `InsightsDataGather` configuration file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: InsightsDataGather
metadata:
....

spec: <1>
  gatherConfig: 
    disabledGatherers: 
      - all <2>
----
+
--
<1> The `spec` parameter specifies gather configurations. 
<2> The `all` value disables all gather operations.
--
To disable individual gather operations, enter their values under the `disabledGatherers` key:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  gatherConfig:
    disabledGatherers:
      - clusterconfig/container_images <1>
      - clusterconfig/host_subnets
      - workloads/workload_info
----
+
--
<1> Example individual gather operation
--
+
. Click *Save*.
+
After you save the changes, the Insights Operator gather configurations are updated and the operations will no longer occur. 

[NOTE]
====
Disabling gather operations degrades Insights Advisor's ability to offer effective recommendations for your cluster.
