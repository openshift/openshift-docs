= Gathering data for specific resources

Instead of collecting data for the entire cluster, you can direct the `must-gather` tool to inspect a specific resource. This method is highly effective for isolating issues within a single project, Operator, or application.

The `must-gather` tool uses `oc adm inspect` internally. You can specify what to inspect by passing the `inspect` command and its arguments after the `--` separator.

.Procedure

* To gather data for a specific namespace, such as `my-project`, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --dest-dir=my-project-must-gather -- oc adm inspect ns/my-project
----

* This command collects all standard resources within the `my-project` namespace, including logs from pods in that namespace, but excludes cluster-scoped resources.

* To gather data related to a specific Cluster Operator, such as `openshift-apiserver`, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --dest-dir=apiserver-must-gather -- oc adm inspect clusteroperator/openshift-apiserver
----

* To exclude logs entirely and significantly reduce the size of the `must-gather` archive, add a double dash (`--`) after `oc adm must-gather` command and add the `--no-logs` argument:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather -- /usr/bin/gather --no-logs
----
