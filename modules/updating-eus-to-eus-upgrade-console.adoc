= EUS-to-EUS update using the web console

.Prerequisites

* Verify that machine config pools are unpaused.
* Have access to the web console as a user with `admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Using the Administrator perspective on the web console, update any Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) Operators to the versions that are compatible with your intended updated version. You can find more information on how to perform this action in "Updating installed Operators"; see "Additional resources".

. Verify that all machine config pools display a status of `Up to date` and that no machine config pool displays a status of `UPDATING`.
+
To view the status of all machine config pools, click *Compute* -> *MachineConfigPools* and review the contents of the *Update status* column.
+
[NOTE]
====
If your machine config pools have an `Updating` status, please wait for this status to change to `Up to date`. This process could take several minutes.
====

. Set your channel to `eus-<4.y+2>`.
+
To set your channel, click *Administration* -> *Cluster Settings* -> *Channel*. You can edit your channel by clicking on the current hyperlinked channel.

. Pause all worker machine pools except for the master pool. You can perform this action on the *MachineConfigPools* tab under the *Compute* page. Select the vertical ellipses next to the machine config pool you'd like to pause and click *Pause updates*.

. Update to version <4.y+1> and complete up to the *Save* step. You can find more information on how to perform these actions in "Updating a cluster by using the web console"; see "Additional resources".

. Ensure that the <4.y+1> updates are complete by viewing the *Last completed version* of your cluster. You can find this information on the *Cluster Settings* page under the *Details* tab.

. If necessary, update your OLM Operators by using the Administrator perspective on the web console. You can find more information on how to perform these actions in "Updating installed Operators"; see "Additional resources".

. Update to version <4.y+2> and complete up to the *Save* step. You can find more information on how to perform these actions in "Updating a cluster by using the web console"; see "Additional resources".

. Ensure that the <4.y+2> update is complete by viewing the *Last completed version* of your cluster. You can find this information on the *Cluster Settings* page under the *Details* tab.

. Unpause all previously paused machine config pools. You can perform this action on the *MachineConfigPools* tab under the *Compute* page. Select the vertical ellipses next to the machine config pool you'd like to unpause and click *Unpause updates*.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If pools are paused, the cluster is not permitted to upgrade to any future minor versions, and some maintenance tasks are inhibited. This puts the cluster at risk for future degradation.
====

. Verify that your previously paused pools are updated and that your cluster has completed the update to version <4.y+2>.
+
You can verify that your pools have updated on the *MachineConfigPools* tab under the *Compute* page by confirming that the *Update status* has a value of *Up to date*.
+
You can verify that your cluster has completed the update by viewing the *Last completed version* of your cluster. You can find this information on the *Cluster Settings* page under the *Details* tab.
