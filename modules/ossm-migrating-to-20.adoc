= Migrating {SMProductName} from version 1.1 to version 2.0

Upgrading from version 1.1 to 2.0 requires manual steps that migrate your workloads and application to a new instance of {SMProductName} running the new version.

.Prerequisites

* You must upgrade to {product-title} 4.7. before you upgrade to {SMProductName} 2.0.
* You must have {SMProductName} version 2.0 operator. If you selected the *automatic* upgrade path, the operator automatically downloads the latest information. However, there are steps you must take to use the features in {SMProductName} version 2.0.

[id="ossm-migrating_{context}"]
== Upgrading {SMProductName}

To upgrade {SMProductName}, you must create an instance of {SMProductName} `ServiceMeshControlPlane` v2 resource in a new namespace. Then, once it's configured, move your microservice applications and workloads from your old mesh to the new service mesh.

.Procedure

. Check your v1 `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource configuration to make sure it is valid.
+
.. Run the following command to view your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource as a v2 resource.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get smcp -o yaml
----
+
.. Check the `spec.techPreview.errored.message` field in the output for information about any invalid fields.
+
.. If there are invalid fields in your v1 resource, the resource is not reconciled and cannot be edited as a v2 resource. All updates to v2 fields will be overridden by the original v1 settings. To fix the invalid fields, you can replace, patch, or edit the v1 version of the resource. You can also delete the resource without fixing it. After the resource has been fixed, it can be reconciled, and you can to modify or view the v2 version of the resource.
+
.. To fix the resource by editing a file, use `oc get` to retrieve the resource, edit the text file locally, and replace the resource with the file you edited.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get smcp.v1.maistra.io <smcp_name> > smcp-resource.yaml
#Edit the smcp-resource.yaml file.
$ oc replace -f smcp-resource.yaml
----
+
.. To fix the resource using patching, use `oc patch`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch smcp.v1.maistra.io <smcp_name> --type json --patch '[{"op": "replace","path":"/spec/path/to/bad/setting","value":"corrected-value"}]'
----
+
.. To fix the resource by editing with command line tools, use `oc edit`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit smcp.v1.maistra.io <smcp_name>
----
+
. Back up your {SMProductShortName} control plane configuration. Switch to the project that contains your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.  In this example, `istio-system` is the name of the {SMProductShortName} control plane project.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project istio-system
----
+
. Enter the following command to retrieve the current configuration. Your <smcp_name> is specified in the metadata of your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource, for example `basic-install` or `full-install`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get servicemeshcontrolplanes.v1.maistra.io <smcp_name> -o yaml > <smcp_name>.v1.yaml
----
+
. Convert your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` to a v2 control plane version that contains information about your configuration as a starting point.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get smcp <smcp_name> -o yaml > <smcp_name>.v2.yaml
----
+
. Create a project. In the {product-title} console Project menu, click `New Project` and enter a name for your project, `istio-system-upgrade`, for example. Or, you can run this command from the CLI.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc new-project istio-system-upgrade
----
+
. Update the `metadata.namespace` field in your v2 `ServiceMeshControlPlane` with your new project name. In this example, use `istio-system-upgrade`.
+
. Update the `version` field from 1.1 to 2.0 or remove it in your v2 `ServiceMeshControlPlane`.
+
. Create a `ServiceMeshControlPlane` in the new namespace. On the command line, run the following command to deploy the control plane with the v2 version of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` that you retrieved. In this example, replace `<smcp_name.v2> `with the path to your file.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -n istio-system-upgrade -f <smcp_name>.v2.yaml
----
+
Alternatively, you can use the console to create the {SMProductShortName} control plane. In the {product-title} web console, click *Project*. Then, select the project name you just entered.
+
.. Click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
.. Click *Create ServiceMeshControlPlane*.
.. Select *YAML view* and paste text of the YAML file you retrieved into the field. Check that the `apiVersion` field is set to `maistra.io/v2` and modify the `metadata.namespace` field to use the new namespace, for example `istio-system-upgrade`.
.. Click *Create*.

[id="ossm-migrating-smcp_{context}"]
== Configuring the 2.0 ServiceMeshControlPlane

The `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource has been changed for {SMProductName} version 2.0. After you created a v2 version of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource, modify it to take advantage of the new features and to fit your deployment. Consider the following changes to the specification and behavior of {SMProductName} 2.0 as you're modifying your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource. You can also refer to the {SMProductName} 2.0 product documentation for new information to features you use. The v2 resource must be used for {SMProductName} 2.0 installations.

[id="ossm-migrating-differences-arch_{context}"]
=== Architecture changes

The architectural units used by previous versions have been replaced by Istiod. In 2.0 the {SMProductShortName} control plane components Mixer, Pilot, Citadel, Galley, and the sidecar injector functionality have been combined into a single component, Istiod.

Although Mixer is no longer supported as a control plane component, Mixer policy and telemetry plugins are now supported through WASM extensions in Istiod. Mixer can be enabled for policy and telemetry if you need to integrate legacy Mixer plugins.

Secret Discovery Service (SDS) is used to distribute certificates and keys to sidecars directly from Istiod. In {SMProductName} version 1.1, secrets were generated by Citadel, which were used by the proxies to retrieve their client certificates and keys.

[id="ossm-migrating-differences-annotation_{context}"]
=== Annotation changes

The following annotations are no longer supported in v2.0. If you are using one of these annotations, you must update your workload before moving it to a v2.0 {SMProductShortName} control plane.

* `sidecar.maistra.io/proxyCPULimit` has been replaced with `sidecar.istio.io/proxyCPULimit`. If you were using `sidecar.maistra.io` annotations on your workloads, you must modify those workloads to use `sidecar.istio.io` equivalents instead.
* `sidecar.maistra.io/proxyMemoryLimit` has been replaced with `sidecar.istio.io/proxyMemoryLimit`
* `sidecar.istio.io/discoveryAddress` is no longer supported. Also, the default discovery address has moved from `pilot.<control_plane_namespace>.svc:15010` (or port 15011, if mtls is enabled) to `istiod-<smcp_name>.<control_plane_namespace>.svc:15012`.
* The health status port is no longer configurable and is hard-coded to 15021.  * If you were defining a custom status port, for example, `status.sidecar.istio.io/port`, you must remove the override before moving the workload to a v2.0 {SMProductShortName} control plane. Readiness checks can still be disabled by setting the status port to `0`.
* Kubernetes Secret resources are no longer used to distribute client certificates for sidecars. Certificates are now distributed through Istiod's SDS service. If you were relying on mounted secrets, they are longer available for workloads in v2.0 {SMProductShortName} control planes.

[id="ossm-migrating-differences-behavior_{context}"]
=== Behavioral changes

Some features in {SMProductName} 2.0 work differently than they did in previous versions.

* The readiness port on gateways has moved from `15020` to `15021`.
* The target host visibility includes VirtualService, as well as ServiceEntry resources. It includes any restrictions applied through Sidecar resources.
* Automatic mutual TLS is enabled by default. Proxy to proxy communication is automatically configured to use mTLS, regardless of global PeerAuthentication policies in place.
* Secure connections are always used when proxies communicate with the {SMProductShortName} control plane regardless of `spec.security.controlPlane.mtls` setting. The `spec.security.controlPlane.mtls` setting is only used when configuring connections for Mixer telemetry or policy.

[id="ossm-migrating-unsupported-resources_{context}"]
=== Migration details for unsupported resources

.Policy (authentication.istio.io/v1alpha1)

Policy resources must be migrated to new resource types for use with v2.0 {SMProductShortName} control planes, PeerAuthentication and RequestAuthentication. Depending on the specific configuration in your Policy resource, you may have to configure multiple resources to achieve the same effect.

.Mutual TLS

Mutual TLS enforcement is accomplished using the `security.istio.io/v1beta1` PeerAuthentication resource. The legacy `spec.peers.mtls.mode` field maps directly to the new resource's `spec.mtls.mode` field. Selection criteria has changed from specifying a service name in `spec.targets[x].name` to a label selector in `spec.selector.matchLabels`. In PeerAuthentication, the labels must match the selector on the services named in the targets list. Any port-specific settings will need to be mapped into `spec.portLevelMtls`.

.Authentication

Additional authentication methods specified in `spec.origins`, must be mapped into a `security.istio.io/v1beta1` RequestAuthentication resource.  `spec.selector.matchLabels` must be configured similarly to the same field on PeerAuthentication. Configuration specific to JWT principals from `spec.origins.jwt` items map to similar fields in `spec.rules` items.

* `spec.origins[x].jwt.triggerRules` specified in the Policy must be mapped into one or more `security.istio.io/v1beta1` AuthorizationPolicy resources. Any `spec.selector.labels` must be configured similarly to the same field on RequestAuthentication.
* `spec.origins[x].jwt.triggerRules.excludedPaths` must be mapped into an AuthorizationPolicy whose spec.action is set to ALLOW, with `spec.rules[x].to.operation.path` entries matching the excluded paths.
* `spec.origins[x].jwt.triggerRules.includedPaths` must be mapped into a separate AuthorizationPolicy whose `spec.action` is set to `ALLOW`, with `spec.rules[x].to.operation.path` entries matching the included paths, and `spec.rules.[x].from.source.requestPrincipals` entries that align with the `specified spec.origins[x].jwt.issuer` in the Policy resource.

.ServiceMeshPolicy (maistra.io/v1)

ServiceMeshPolicy was configured automatically for the {SMProductShortName} control plane through the `spec.istio.global.mtls.enabled` in the v1 resource or `spec.security.dataPlane.mtls` in the v2 resource setting. For v2 control planes, a functionally equivalent PeerAuthentication resource is created during installation. This feature is deprecated in {SMProductName} version 2.0

.RbacConfig, ServiceRole, ServiceRoleBinding (rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1)

These resources were replaced by the `security.istio.io/v1beta1` AuthorizationPolicy resource.

Mimicking RbacConfig behavior requires writing a default AuthorizationPolicy whose settings depend on the spec.mode specified in the RbacConfig.

* When `spec.mode` is set to `OFF`, no resource is required as the default policy is ALLOW, unless an AuthorizationPolicy applies to the request.
* When `spec.mode` is set to ON, set `spec: {}`.  You must create AuthorizationPolicy policies for all services in the mesh.
* `spec.mode` is set to `ON_WITH_INCLUSION`, must create an AuthorizationPolicy with `spec: {}` in each included namespace. Inclusion of individual services is not supported by AuthorizationPolicy. However, as soon as any AuthorizationPolicy is created that applies to the workloads for the service, all other requests not explicitly allowed will be denied.
* When `spec.mode` is set to `ON_WITH_EXCLUSION`, it is not supported by AuthorizationPolicy. A global DENY policy can be created, but an AuthorizationPolicy must be created for every workload in the mesh because there is no allow-all policy that can be applied to either a namespace or a workload.

AuthorizationPolicy includes configuration for both the selector to which the configuration applies, which is similar to the function ServiceRoleBinding provides and the rules which should be applied, which is similar to the function ServiceRole provides.

.ServiceMeshRbacConfig (maistra.io/v1)

This resource is replaced by using a `security.istio.io/v1beta1` AuthorizationPolicy resource with an empty spec.selector in the {SMProductShortName} control plane's namespace.  This policy will be the default authorization policy applied to all workloads in the mesh.  For specific migration details, see RbacConfig above.

[id="ossm-migrating-mixer_{context}"]
=== Mixer plugins

Mixer components are disabled by default in version 2.0. If you rely on Mixer plugins for your workload, you must configure your version 2.0 `ServiceMeshControlPlane` to include the Mixer components.

To enable the Mixer policy components, add the following snippet to your `ServiceMeshControlPlane`.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  policy:
    type: Mixer
----

To enable the Mixer telemetry components, add the following snippet to your `ServiceMeshControlPlane`.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  telemetry:
    type: Mixer
----

Legacy mixer plugins can also be migrated to WASM and integrated using the new ServiceMeshExtension (maistra.io/v1alpha1) custom resource.

Built-in WASM filters included in the upstream Istio distribution are not available in {SMProductName} 2.0.

[id="ossm-migrating-mtls_{context}"]
=== Mutual TLS changes

When using mTLS with workload specific PeerAuthentication policies, a corresponding DestinationRule is required to allow traffic if the workload policy differs from the namespace/global policy.

Auto mTLS is enabled by default, but can be disabled by setting `spec.security.dataPlane.automtls` to false in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource. When disabling auto mTLS, DestinationRules may be required for proper communication between services. For example, setting PeerAuthentication to `STRICT` for one namespace may prevent services in other namespaces from accessing them, unless a DestinationRule configures TLS mode for the services in the namespace.

For information about mTLS, see xref:../../service_mesh/v2x/ossm-security.adoc#ossm-security-mtls_ossm-security[Enabling mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)]

[id="ossm-migrating-config-recipes_{context}"]
== Configuration recipes

You can configure the following items with these configuration recipes.

[id="ossm-migrating-config-mtls_{context}"]
=== Mutual TLS in a data plane

Mutual TLS for data plane communication is configured through `spec.security.dataPlane.mtls` in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource, which is `false` by default.

[id="ossm-migrating-config-sign-key_{context}"]
=== Custom signing key

Istiod manages client certificates and private keys used by service proxies. By default, Istiod uses a self-signed certificate for signing, but you can configure a custom certificate and private key. For more information about how to configure signing keys, see xref:../../service_mesh/v2x/ossm-security.adoc#ossm-cert-manage_ossm-security[Adding an external certificate authority key and certificate]

[id="ossm-migrating-config-tracing_{context}"]
=== Tracing

Tracing is configured in `spec.tracing`. Currently, the only type of tracer that is supported is `Jaeger`. Sampling is a scaled integer representing 0.01% increments, for example, 1 is 0.01% and 10000 is 100%. The tracing implementation and sampling rate can be specified:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  tracing:
    sampling: 100 # 1%
    type: Jaeger
----

Jaeger is configured in the `addons` section of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  addons:
    jaeger:
      name: jaeger
      install:
        storage:
          type: Memory # or Elasticsearch for production mode
          memory:
            maxTraces: 100000
          elasticsearch: # the following values only apply if storage:type:=Elasticsearch
            storage: # specific storageclass configuration for the Jaeger Elasticsearch (optional)
              size: "100G"
              storageClassName: "storageclass"
            nodeCount: 3
            redundancyPolicy: SingleRedundancy
  runtime:
    components:
      tracing.jaeger: {} # general Jaeger specific runtime configuration (optional)
      tracing.jaeger.elasticsearch: #runtime configuration for Jaeger Elasticsearch deployment (optional)
        container:
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: "1Gi"
              cpu: "500m"
            limits:
              memory: "1Gi"
----

The Jaeger installation can be customized with the `install` field. Container configuration, such as resource limits is configured in `spec.runtime.components.jaeger` related fields. If a Jaeger resource matching the value of `spec.addons.jaeger.name` exists, the {SMProductShortName} control plane will be configured to use the existing installation. Use an existing Jaeger resource to fully customize your Jaeger installation.

[id="ossm-migrating-config-vis_{context}"]
=== Visualization

Kiali and Grafana are configured under the `addons` section of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  addons:
    grafana:
      enabled: true
      install: {} # customize install
    kiali:
      enabled: true
      name: kiali
      install: {} # customize install
----

The Grafana and Kiali installations can be customized through their respective `install` fields. Container customization, such as resource limits, is configured in `spec.runtime.components.kiali` and `spec.runtime.components.grafana`. If an existing Kiali resource matching the value of name exists, the {SMProductShortName} control plane configures the Kiali resource for use with the control plane. Some fields in the Kiali resource are overridden, such as the `accessible_namespaces` list, as well as the endpoints for Grafana, Prometheus, and tracing. Use an existing resource to fully customize your Kiali installation.
