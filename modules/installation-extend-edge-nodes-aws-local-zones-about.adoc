= About creating user workloads in AWS Local Zones or Wavelength Zones

[role="_abstract"]
When you use the installation program to create a cluster, the installation program automatically specifies a taint effect of `NoSchedule` to each edge compute node. So, a scheduler does not add a new pod, or deployment, to a node if the pod does not match the specified tolerations for a taint.

You can modify the taint for better control over how nodes create workloads in each {zone-type} subnet.

The installation program creates the compute machine set manifests file with `node-role.kubernetes.io/edge` and `node-role.kubernetes.io/worker` labels applied to each edge compute node that is located in a {zone-type} subnet.

[NOTE]
====
The examples in the procedure are for a Local Zones infrastructure. If you are working with a Wavelength Zones infrastructure, ensure you adapt the examples to what is supported in this infrastructure.
