= Migration prerequisites

* You must be logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges on all clusters.

.Direct image migration

* You must ensure that the secure {product-registry} of the source cluster is exposed.
* You must create a route to the exposed registry.

.Direct volume migration

* If your clusters use proxies, you must configure an Stunnel TCP proxy.

ifdef::migrating-applications-3-4,advanced-migration-options-3-4[]
.Internal images

* If your application uses internal images from the `openshift` namespace, you must ensure that the required versions of the images are present on the target cluster.
+
You can manually update an image stream tag in order to use a deprecated {product-title} 3 image on an {product-title} {product-version} cluster.
endif::[]

.Clusters

* The source cluster must be upgraded to the latest {mtc-short} z-stream release.
* The {mtc-short} version must be the same on all clusters.

.Network

* The clusters have unrestricted network access to each other and to the replication repository.
* If you copy the persistent volumes with `move`, the clusters must have unrestricted network access to the remote volumes.
ifdef::migrating-applications-3-4,advanced-migration-options-3-4[]
* You must enable the following ports on an {product-title} 3 cluster:
** `8443` (API server)
** `443` (routes)
** `53` (DNS)
endif::[]
* You must enable the following ports on an {product-title} 4 cluster:
** `6443` (API server)
** `443` (routes)
** `53` (DNS)
* You must enable port `443` on the replication repository if you are using TLS.

.Persistent volumes (PVs)

* The PVs must be valid.
* The PVs must be bound to persistent volume claims.
* If you use snapshots to copy the PVs, the following additional prerequisites apply:
** The cloud provider must support snapshots.
** The PVs must have the same cloud provider.
** The PVs must be located in the same geographic region.
** The PVs must have the same storage class.
