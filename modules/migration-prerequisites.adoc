= Prerequisites

The {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) has the following prerequisites:

* You must be logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges on all clusters.
* The {mtc-short} version must be the same on all clusters.
ifdef::migrating-3-4[]
* If your application uses internal images from the `openshift` namespace, you must ensure that the required versions of the images are present on the target cluster.
+
You can manually update an image stream tag in order to use a deprecated {product-title} 3 image on an {product-title} {product-version} cluster.
endif::[]
* Clusters:
** The source cluster must be upgraded to the latest {mtc-short} z-stream release.
** The cluster on which the `migration-controller` pod is running must have unrestricted network access to the other clusters.
** The clusters must have unrestricted network access to each other.
** The clusters must have unrestricted network access to the replication repository.
** The clusters must be able to communicate using OpenShift routes on port 443.
** The clusters must have no critical conditions.
** The clusters must be in a ready state.

* Volume migration:
** The persistent volumes (PVs) must be valid.
** The PVs must be bound to persistent volume claims.
** If you copy the PVs by using the _move_ method, the clusters must have unrestricted network access to the remote volume.
** If you copy the PVs by using the _snapshot_ copy method, the following prerequisites apply:
*** The cloud provider must support snapshots.
*** The volumes must have the same cloud provider.
*** The volumes must be located in the same geographic region.
*** The volumes must have the same storage class.

* If you perform a direct volume migration in a proxy environment, you must configure an Stunnel TCP proxy.
* If you perform a direct image migration, you must expose the internal registry of the source cluster to external traffic.
