= Assembling a pipeline

A pipeline represents a CI/CD flow and is defined by the tasks to be executed. It is designed to be generic and reusable in multiple applications and environments.

A pipeline specifies how the tasks interact with each other and their order of execution using the `from` and `runAfter` parameters. It uses the `workspaces` field to specify one or more volumes that each task in the pipeline requires during execution.

In this section, you will create a pipeline that takes the source code of the application from GitHub, and then builds and deploys it on {OCP}.

The pipeline performs the following tasks for the back-end application `pipelines-vote-api` and front-end application `pipelines-vote-ui`:

* Clones the source code of the application from the Git repository by referring to the `git-url` and `git-revision` parameters.
* Builds the container image using the `buildah` task provided in the `openshift-pipelines` namespace.
* Pushes the image to the {product-registry} by referring to the `image` parameter.
* Deploys the new image on {OCP} by using the `apply-manifests` and `update-deployment` tasks.

The pipeline definition abstracts away the specifics of the Git source repository and image registries. These details are added as `params` when a pipeline is triggered and executed.

. Create the pipeline:
+
----
$ oc create -f <pipeline-yaml-file-name.yaml>
----
+
Alternatively, you can also execute the YAML file directly from the Git repository:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/pipelines-tutorial/{pipelines-ver}/01_pipeline/04_pipeline.yaml
----

. Use the `tkn pipeline list` command to verify that the pipeline is added to the application:
+
----
$ tkn pipeline list
----
+
The output verifies that the `build-and-deploy` pipeline was created:
