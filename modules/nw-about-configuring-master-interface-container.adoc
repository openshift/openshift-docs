= About configuring the master interface in the container network namespace

In {product-title} 4.14 and later, the ability to allow users to create a MAC-VLAN, IP-VLAN, and VLAN subinterface based on a master interface in a container namespace is now generally available.

This feature allows you to create the master interfaces as part of the pod network configuration in a separate network attachment definition. You can then base the VLAN, MACVLAN, or IPVLAN on this interface without requiring the knowledge of the network configuration of the node.

To ensure the use of a container namespace master interface, specify the `linkInContainer` and set the value to `true` in the VLAN, MACVLAN, or IPVLAN plugin configuration depending on the particular type of additional network.
