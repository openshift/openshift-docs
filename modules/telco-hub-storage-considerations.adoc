= Storage considerations

Limits and requirements::
+
--
* Minimum {product-title} and {rh-rhacm} limits apply
* High availability should be provided through a storage backend.
The hub cluster reference configuration provides storage through {rh-storage}.
* Object bucket storage is provided through {rh-storage}.
--

Engineering considerations::
* Use SSD or NVMe disks with low latency and high throughput for etcd storage.

* The storage solution for Telco hub clusters is Red Hat {rh-storage}.
** Local Storage Operator supports the storage class used by {rh-storage} to provide block, file, and object storage as needed by other components on the hub cluster.
* The Local Storage Operator `LocalVolume` configuration includes setting `forceWipeDevicesAndDestroyAllData: true` to support the reinstallation of hub cluster nodes where {rh-storage} has previously been used.
