= Creating a new project

A project enables a community of users to organize and manage their content in isolation. Projects are {product-title} extensions to Kubernetes namespaces. Projects have additional features that enable user self-provisioning.

Users must receive access to projects from administrators. Cluster administrators can allow developers to create their own projects. In most cases, users automatically have access to their own projects.

Each project has its own set of objects, policies, constraints, and service accounts.
