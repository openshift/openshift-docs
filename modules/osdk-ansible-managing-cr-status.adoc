= Managing Custom Resource status using the `operator_sdk.util` Ansible collection

Ansible-based Operators automatically update Custom Resource (CR)
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#status-subresource[`status` subresources]
with generic information about the previous Ansible run. This includes the
number of successful and failed tasks and relevant error messages as shown:

[source,yaml]
----
status:
  conditions:
    - ansibleResult:
      changed: 3
      completion: 2018-12-03T13:45:57.13329
      failures: 1

    type: Failure

    message: Running reconciliation
    reason: Running
    status: "True"
    type: Running

Ansible-based Operators also allow Operator authors to supply custom status
values with the `k8s_status` Ansible module, which is included in the
link:https://galaxy.ansible.com/operator_sdk/util[`operator_sdk.util` collection].
This allows the author to update the `status` from within Ansible with any
key-value pair as desired.

By default, Ansible-based Operators always include the generic Ansible
run output as shown above. If you would prefer your application did _not_ update
the status with Ansible output, you can track the status manually
from your application.

.Procedure

. To track CR status manually from your application, update the Watches file
with a `manageStatus` field set to `false`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- version: v1
  group: api.example.com
  kind: Foo
  role: Foo
  manageStatus: false
----

. Use the `operator_sdk.util.k8s_status` Ansible module to update the subresource.
For example, to update with key `foo` and value `bar`, `operator_sdk.util` can
be used as shown:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- operator_sdk.util.k8s_status:
    api_version: app.example.com/v1
    kind: Foo
    name: "{{ meta.name }}"
    namespace: "{{ meta.namespace }}"
    status:
      foo: bar
----
+
Collections can also be declared in the `meta/main.yml` for the role, which is
included for new scaffolded Ansible Operators.
+
[source,yaml]
----
collections:
  - operator_sdk.util
----
+
Declaring collections in the role meta allows you to invoke the `k8s_status`
module directly:
+
[source,yaml]
----
k8s_status:
  <snip>
  status:
    foo: bar
----
