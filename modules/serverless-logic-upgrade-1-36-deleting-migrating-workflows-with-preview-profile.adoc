.Procedure

. If you are using persistence, back up the workflow database and ensure the backup includes both database objects and table data.

. Ensure you have a backup of all necessary Kubernetes resources, including `SonataFlow` custom resources (CRs), `ConfigMap` resources, or any other related custom configurations.

. Delete the workflow by executing the following command: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete workflow <workflow_name> -n <target_namespace>
