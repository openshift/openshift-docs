= Requirements for clusters on {rh-openstack} that use SR-IOV

To use single-root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) with your deployment, you must meet the following requirements:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/16.2/html-single/network_functions_virtualization_planning_and_configuration_guide/index#assembly_sriov_parameters[Plan your {rh-openstack-first} SR-IOV deployment].

* {product-title} must support the NICs that you use. For a list of supported NICs, see "About Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) hardware networks" in the "Hardware networks" subsection of the "Networking" documentation.

* For each node that will have an attached SR-IOV NIC, your {rh-openstack} cluster must have:

   ** One instance from the {rh-openstack} quota
   ** One port attached to the machines subnet
   **  One port for each SR-IOV Virtual Function
   ** A flavor with at least 16 GB memory, 4 vCPUs, and 25 GB storage space

* SR-IOV deployments often employ performance optimizations, such as dedicated or isolated CPUs. For maximum performance, configure your underlying {rh-openstack} deployment to use these optimizations, and then run {product-title} compute machines on the optimized infrastructure.
** For more information about configuring performant {rh-openstack} compute nodes, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/16.1/html-single/configuring_the_compute_service_for_instance_creation/configuring-compute-nodes-for-performance#configuring-compute-nodes-for-performance[Configuring Compute nodes for performance].
