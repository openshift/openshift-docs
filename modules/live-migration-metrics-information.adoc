= Information about live migration metrics

The following table shows you the available metrics and the label values populated from the `openshift_network_operator_live_migration_procedure` expression. Use this information to monitor progress or to troubleshoot the migration.

| Metric | Label values
| 
*`openshift_network_operator_live_migration_blocked:`*::
+
--
A Prometheus gauge vector metric. A metric that contains a constant `1` value labeled with the reason that the CNI live migration might not have started. This metric is available when the CNI live migration has started by annotating the `Network` custom resource. +
This metric is not published unless the live migration is blocked. 
--
| 
The list of label values includes the following::
+
--
* `UnsupportedCNI`: Unable to migrate to the unsupported target CNI. Valid CNI is `OVNKubernetes` when migrating from OpenShift SDN.
* `UnsupportedHyperShiftCluster`: Live migration is unsupported within an HCP cluster.
* `UnsupportedSDNNetworkIsolationMode`: OpenShift SDN is configured with an unsupported network isolation mode `Multitenant`. Migrate to a supported network isolation mode before performing live migration.
* `UnsupportedMACVLANInterface`: Remove the egress router or any pods which contain the pod annotation `pod.network.openshift.io/assign-macvlan`. 
Find the offending pod's namespace or pod name with the following command: +
 +
`oc get pods -Ao=jsonpath='{range .items[?(@.metadata.annotations.pod\.network\.openshift\.io/assign-macvlan=="")]}{@.metadata.namespace}{"\t"}{@.metadata.name}{"\n"}'`.

| 
*`openshift_network_operator_live_migration_condition:`*::
+
--
A metric which represents the status of each condition type for the CNI live migration. The set of status condition types is defined for `network.config` to support observability of the CNI live migration. +
A `1` value represents condition status `true`. A `0` value represents `false`. `-1` represents unknown. This metric is available when the CNI live migration has started by annotating the `Network` custom resource (CR). +
This metric is only available when the live migration has been triggered by adding the relevant annotation to the `Network` CR cluster, otherwise, it is not published. If the following condition types are not present within the Network CR cluster, the metric and their labels are cleared.

The list of label values includes the following::
+
--
* `NetworkTypeMigrationInProgress`
* `NetworkTypeMigrationTargetCNIAvailable`
* `NetworkTypeMigrationTargetCNIInUse`
* `NetworkTypeMigrationOriginalCNIPurged`
* `NetworkTypeMigrationMTUReady`
