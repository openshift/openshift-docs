= Reloading the firewall deletes iptable rules

OVN-Kubernetes handles incoming NodePort traffic by using iptable rules. When you reload firewall rules with the `firewall-cmd --reload` command, the iptable rules are deleted. This stops the NodePort service traffic and any other host traffic that uses iptable rules.

[id="microshift-ki-cni-iptables-deleted-workaround_{context}"]
== Restarting the daemon set pod as a workaround
To troubleshoot this issue, delete the ovnkube-master pod to restart the ovnkube daemon set pod. Restarting the ovnkube daemon set pod will trigger a reconciliation of the iptable rules.

.Prerequisites

* The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) is installed.
* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* A cluster installed on infrastructure configured with the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.
* The KUBECONFIG environment variable is set.

.Procedure

Run the commands listed in each step that follows to restore the iptable rules.

. Find the name of the ovnkube-master pod that you want to restart by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ pod=$(oc get pods -n openshift-ovn-kubernetes | grep ovnkube-master | awk -F " " '{print $1}')
----

. Delete the ovnkube-master pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-ovn-kubernetes delete pod $pod
----
+
This command causes the daemon set pod to be automatically restarted, causing a reconciliation of the iptable rules.

. Confirm that the iptables have reconciled by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo iptables-save | grep NODEPORT
:OVN-KUBE-NODEPORT - [0:0]
-A PREROUTING -j OVN-KUBE-NODEPORT
-A OUTPUT -j OVN-KUBE-NODEPORT
-A OVN-KUBE-NODEPORT -p tcp -m addrtype --dst-type LOCAL -m tcp --dport 30768 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.43.17.173:443
-A OVN-KUBE-NODEPORT -p tcp -m addrtype --dst-type LOCAL -m tcp --dport 32122 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.43.17.173:80
----

. You can also confirm that a new ovnkube-master pod has been started by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-ovn-kubernetes
----
The listing of the running pods shows a new ovnkube-master pod name and age.
