= Viewing security information in Red Hat Developer Hub

By configuring and integrating the {rh-rhacs-first} plugin with {rh-rhdh-first}, you can access vulnerability data, assess risks, and take proactive security actions without leaving the {rh-rhdh} environment.

Review the upstream plugin progress and details by visiting link:https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins[Community plugins for Backstage].

.Prerequisites

* You have enabled the {product-title-short} plugin installation in {rh-rhdh}.

.Procedure

. Create an `app-config.yaml` file that contains the `proxy` and `acs` stanzas by using the following content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
proxy:
  endpoints:
    /acs:
      target: ${ACS_API_URL}
      headers:
        authorization: Bearer ${ACS_API_KEY}
acs:
  acsUrl: ${ACS_API_URL}
# ...
----

. To enable the {product-title-short} plugin, perform the following steps:
.. Navigate to the dynamic plugins configuration file in your {rh-rhdh} setup.
.. To include the {product-title-short} plugin, add the following content to the configuration file, for example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
- package: https://github.com/RedHatInsights/backstage-plugin-advanced-cluster-security/releases/download/v0.1.1/redhatinsights-backstage-plugin-acs-dynamic-0.1.1.tgz

        redhatinsights.backstage-plugin-acs:
          entityTabs:
            - path: /acs
              title: RHACS
              mountPoint: entity.page.acs
          mountPoints:
            - mountPoint: entity.page.acs/cards
              importName: EntityACSContent
              config:
                layout:
                  gridColumnEnd:
                    lg: span 12
                    md: span 12
                    xs: span 12
# ...
----

. To add annotations for entities in the {rh-rhdh} catalog, perform the following steps:
+
[NOTE]
====
To display the vulnerability data, each component entity in the {rh-rhdh} catalog must reference the {product-title-short} deployments.

The following values are associated with the entities in the {rh-rhdh} catalog:

** `API`
** `Component`
** `Domain`
** `Group`
** `Location`
** `Resource`
** `System`
** `Template`
** `User`
====
.. Navigate to the entity configuration file for your service in your {rh-rhdh} setup.
.. Add the following annotation to the configuration file, for example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: test-service
  annotations:
    acs/deployment-name: test-deployment-1,test-deployment-2,test-deployment-3
# ...
----

.Verification

. In the {rh-rhdh} portal, click *Catalog*.
. Click an entity and verify that the *{product-title-short}* tab appears.
. To view the violations and vulnerability data, click the *{product-title-short}* tab.
