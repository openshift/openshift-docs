= Customer requirements when using STS for deployment

The following prerequisites must be complete before you deploy a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster that uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS).

[id="rosa-account_{context}"]
== Account
* The customer ensures that the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html[AWS limits] are sufficient to support {product-title} provisioned within the customer's AWS account.
* If SCP policies are applied and enforced, these policies must not be more restrictive than the roles and policies required by the cluster.
* The customer's AWS account should not be transferable to Red Hat.
* The customer should not impose additional AWS usage restrictions beyond the defined roles and policies on Red Hat activities. Imposing restrictions will severely hinder Red Hat's ability to respond to incidents.
* The customer may deploy native AWS services within the same AWS account.
* The account must have a service-linked role set up as it is required for elastic load balancers (ELBs) to be configured.
+
[NOTE]
====
Customers are encouraged, but not mandated, to deploy resources in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) separate from the VPC hosting {product-title} and other Red Hat supported services.

[id="rosa-associating-account_{context}"]
== Associating your AWS account

To perform {product-title} (ROSA) cluster provisioning tasks, you must create `ocm-role` and `user-role` IAM resources in your AWS account and link them to your Red Hat organization.

The `ocm-role` ARN is stored as a label in your Red Hat organization while the `user-role` ARN is stored as a label inside your Red Hat user account. Red Hat uses these ARN labels to confirm that the user is a valid account holder and that the correct permissions are available to perform the necessary tasks in the AWS account.

.Prerequisites

* You have an AWS account.
* You are using {cluster-manager-url} to create clusters.
* You have the permissions required to install AWS account-wide roles.
* You have installed and configured the latest AWS (`aws`) and ROSA (`rosa`) CLIs on your installation host.
* You have created your `ocm-role` and `user-role` IAM roles.

.Procedures

. From the CLI, link your `ocm-role` resource to your Red Hat organization by using your Amazon Resource Name (ARN):
+
[NOTE]
====
You must have organization administrator privileges to run the `rosa link` command. After you link the `ocm-role` resource with your AWS account, it is visible for all users in the organization.

[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa link ocm-role --role-arn <arn>

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
I: Linking OCM role
? Link the '<AWS ACCOUNT ID>` role with organization '<ORG ID>'? Yes
I: Successfully linked role-arn '<AWS ACCOUNT ID>' with organization account '<ORG ID>'
----
. From the CLI, link your `user-role` resource to your Red Hat user account by using your Amazon Resource Name (ARN):
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa link user-role --role-arn <arn>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
I: Linking User role
? Link the 'arn:aws:iam::<ARN>:role/ManagedOpenShift-User-Role-125' role with organization '<AWS ID>'? Yes
I: Successfully linked role-arn 'arn:aws:iam::<ARN>:role/ManagedOpenShift-User-Role-125' with organization account '<AWS ID>'

[id="rosa-associating-multiple-account_{context}"]
=== Associating multiple AWS accounts with your Red Hat organization

You can associate multiple AWS accounts with your Red Hat organization. Associating multiple accounts lets you create {product-title} (ROSA) clusters on any of the associated AWS accounts from your Red Hat organization.

With this feature, you can create clusters in different AWS regions by using multiple AWS profiles as region-bound environments.

.Specifying an AWS profile name when creating the OCM, user, and account roles

To associate an additional AWS account, first create a profile in your local AWS configuration. Then, associate the account with your Red Hat organization by creating the `ocm-role`, user, and account roles in the additional AWS account.

To create the roles in an additional region, specify the `--profile <aws-profile>` parameter when running the `rosa create` commands and replace `<aws_profile>` with the additional account profile name:

* To specify an AWS account profile when creating an {cluster-manager} role:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create --profile <aws_profile> ocm-role
----

* To specify an AWS account profile when creating a user role:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create --profile <aws_profile> user-role
----

* To specify an AWS account profile when creating the account roles:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa create --profile <aws_profile> account-roles
----

[NOTE]
====
If you do not specify a profile, the default AWS profile is used.

[id="rosa-access-requirements_{context}"]
== Access requirements

* Red Hat must have AWS console access to the customer-provided AWS account. This access is protected and managed by Red Hat.
* The customer must not utilize the AWS account to elevate their permissions within the {product-title} cluster.
* Actions available in the `rosa` CLI utility or {cluster-manager-url} console must not be directly performed in the customer's AWS account.

[id="rosa-support-requirements_{context}"]
== Support requirements
* Red Hat recommends that the customer have at least link:https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/[Business Support] from AWS.
* Red Hat may have permission from the customer to request AWS support on their behalf.
* Red Hat may have permission from the customer to request AWS resource limit increases on the customer's account.
* Red Hat manages the restrictions, limitations, expectations, and defaults for all {product-title} clusters in the same manner, unless otherwise specified in this requirements section.

[id="rosa-security-requirements_{context}"]
== Security requirements
* Volume snapshots will remain within the customer's AWS account and customer-specified region.
* Red Hat must have ingress access to EC2 hosts and the API server from allow-listed IP addresses.
* Red Hat must have egress allowed to the documented domains.
