= Customer requirements when using STS for deployment

The following prerequisites must be complete before you deploy {product-title} (ROSA) clusters using STS.

[id="rosa-account_{context}"]
== Account
* The customer ensures that the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html[AWS limits] are sufficient to support {product-title} provisioned within the customer's AWS account.
* If SCP policies are applied and enforced, these policies must not be more restrictive than the roles and policies required by the cluster.
* The customer's AWS account should not be transferable to Red Hat.
* The customer should not impose additional AWS usage restrictions beyond the defined roles and policies on Red Hat activities. Imposing restrictions will severely hinder Red Hat's ability to respond to incidents.
* The customer may deploy native AWS services within the same AWS account.
* The account must have a service-linked role set up as it is required for elastic load balancers (ELBs) to be configured.

[NOTE]
====
Customers are encouraged, but not mandated, to deploy resources in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) separate from the VPC hosting {product-title} and other Red Hat supported services.

[id="rosa-access-requirements_{context}"]
== Access requirements

* Red Hat must have AWS console access to the customer-provided AWS account. This access is protected and managed by Red Hat.
* The customer must not utilize the AWS account to elevate their permissions within the {product-title} cluster.
* Actions available in the `rosa` CLI utility or link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift[OpenShift Cluster Manager (OCM)] console must not be directly performed in the customer's AWS account.

[id="rosa-support-requirements_{context}"]
== Support requirements
* Red Hat recommends that the customer have at least link:https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/[Business Support] from AWS.
* Red Hat may have permission from the customer to request AWS support on their behalf.
* Red Hat may have permission from the customer to request AWS resource limit increases on the customer's account.
* Red Hat manages the restrictions, limitations, expectations, and defaults for all {product-title} clusters in the same manner, unless otherwise specified in this requirements section.

[id="rosa-security-requirements_{context}"]
== Security requirements
* Volume snapshots will remain within the customer's AWS account and customer-specified region.
* Red Hat must have ingress access to EC2 hosts and the API server from allow-listed IP addresses.
* Red Hat must have egress allowed to the documented domains.
