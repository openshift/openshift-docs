= Setting a log level for the {cert-manager-operator}

You can set a log level for the {cert-manager-operator} to determine the verbosity of the operator log messages.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have installed version 1.11.1 or later of the {cert-manager-operator}.

.Procedure

* Update the subscription object for {cert-manager-operator} to provide the verbosity level for the operator logs by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n cert-manager-operator patch subscription openshift-cert-manager-operator --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"config":{"env":[{"name":"OPERATOR_LOG_LEVEL","value":"v"}]}}}' <1>
----
<1> Replace `v` with the desired log level number. The valid values for `v` can range from `1`to `10`. The default value is `2`.

.Verification

. The cert-manager Operator pod is redeployed. Verify that the log level of the {cert-manager-operator} is updated by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc set env deploy/cert-manager-operator-controller-manager -n cert-manager-operator --list | grep -e OPERATOR_LOG_LEVEL -e container
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
# deployments/cert-manager-operator-controller-manager, container kube-rbac-proxy
OPERATOR_LOG_LEVEL=9
# deployments/cert-manager-operator-controller-manager, container cert-manager-operator
OPERATOR_LOG_LEVEL=9
----

. Verify that the log level of the {cert-manager-operator} is updated by running the `oc logs` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs deploy/cert-manager-operator-controller-manager -n cert-manager-operator
