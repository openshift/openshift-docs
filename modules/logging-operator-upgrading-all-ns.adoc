= Upgrading the {clo} to watch all namespaces

In logging 5.7 and older versions, the {clo} only watches the `openshift-logging` namespace.
If you want the {clo} to watch all namespaces on your cluster, you must redeploy the Operator. You can complete the following procedure to redeploy the Operator without deleting your logging components.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oc-first}.
* You have administrator permissions.

.Procedure

. Delete the subscription by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-logging delete subscription <subscription>
----

. Delete the Operator group by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-logging delete operatorgroup <operator_group_name>
----

. Delete the cluster service version (CSV) by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete clusterserviceversion cluster-logging.<version>
----

. Redeploy the {clo} by following the "Installing Logging" documentation.

.Verification

* Check that the `targetNamespaces` field in the `OperatorGroup` resource is not present or is set to an empty string.
+
To do this, run the following command and inspect the output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get operatorgroup <operator_group_name> -o yaml
----
+
