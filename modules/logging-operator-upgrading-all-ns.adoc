= Upgrading the Cluster Logging Operator to watch all namespaces

In logging 5.7 and older versions, the Cluster Logging Operator only watches the `openshift-logging` namespace.
If you want the Cluster Logging Operator to watch all namespaces on your cluster, you must redeploy the Operator. You can complete the following procedure to redeploy the Operator without deleting your logging components.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oc-first}.
* You have administrator permissions.

.Procedure

. Delete the subscription by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-logging delete subscription <subscription>
----

. Delete the Operator group by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-logging delete operatorgroup <operator_group_name>
----

. Delete the cluster service version (CSV) by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete clusterserviceversion cluster-logging.<version>
----

. Redeploy the Cluster Logging Operator by following the "Installing Logging" documentation.

.Verification

* Check that the `targetNamespaces` field in the `OperatorGroup` resource is not present or is set to an empty string.
+
To do this, run the following command and inspect the output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get operatorgroup <operator_group_name> -o yaml
----
+
