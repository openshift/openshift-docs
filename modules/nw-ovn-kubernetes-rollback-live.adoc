= Using the live migration method to migrate to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin

As a cluster administrator, you can rollback to the OpenShift SDN Container Network Interface (CNI) network plugin by using the live migration method. During the migration with this method, nodes are automatically rebooted and service to the cluster is not interrupted.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must wait until the migration process from OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes network plugin is successful before initiating a rollback.
