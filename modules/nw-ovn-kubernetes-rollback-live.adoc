= Using the live migration method to roll back to the OpenShift SDN network plugin

As a cluster administrator, you can roll back to the OpenShift SDN Container Network Interface (CNI) network plugin by using the live migration method. During the migration with this method, nodes are automatically rebooted and service to the cluster is not interrupted.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must wait until the migration process from OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes network plugin is successful before initiating a rollback.
====

If a rollback to OpenShift SDN is required, the following table describes the process.

| Add the `unsupported-red-hat-internal-testing` annotation to the cluster-level network configuration. 
| The Cluster Network Operator (CNO) acknowledges the unsupported testing environment.

| Patch the cluster-level networking configuration by changing the `networkType` from `OVNKubernetes` to `OpenShiftSDN`.

Cluster Network Operator (CNO):: Performs the following actions:
+
--
* Sets migration related fields in the `network.operator` custom resource (CR) and waits for routable MTUs to be applied to all nodes by the Machine Config Operator (MCO).
* Patches the `network.operator` CR to set the migration mode to `Live` for OpenShiftSDN and deploys the OpenShiftSDN network plugin in migration mode.
* Deploys OVN-Kubernetes with hybrid overlay enabled.
* Waits for both CNI plugins to be deployed and updates the conditions in the status of the `network.config` CR.
* Triggers the MCO to apply the new machine config to each machine config pool, which includes node cordoning, draining, and rebooting.
* Removes migration-related fields from the `network.operator` CR and performs cleanup actions, such as deleting OpenShift SDN resources and redeploying OVN-Kubernetes in normal mode with the necessary configurations.
* Waits for the OpenShiftSDN redeployment and updates the status conditions in the `network.config` CR to indicate migration completion.

.Prerequisites

* The {oc-first} is installed.
* Access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role is available.
* The cluster is installed on infrastructure configured with the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.
* A recent backup of the etcd database is available.
* A manual reboot can be triggered for each node.
* The cluster is in a known good state, without any errors.

.Procedure

. To initiate the rollback to OpenShift SDN, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch Network.config.openshift.io cluster --type='merge' --patch '{"metadata":{"annotations":{"network.openshift.io/network-type-migration":""}},"spec":{"networkType":"OpenShiftSDN"}}'
----

. To watch the progress of your migration, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ watch -n1 'oc get network.config/cluster -o json | jq ".status.conditions[]|\"\\(.type) \\(.status) \\(.reason) \\(.message)\""  -r | column --table --table-columns NAME,STATUS,REASON,MESSAGE --table-columns-limit 4; echo; oc get mcp -o wide; echo; oc get node -o "custom-columns=NAME:metadata.name,STATE:metadata.annotations.machineconfiguration\\.openshift\\.io/state,DESIRED:metadata.annotations.machineconfiguration\\.openshift\\.io/desiredConfig,CURRENT:metadata.annotations.machineconfiguration\\.openshift\\.io/currentConfig,REASON:metadata.annotations.machineconfiguration\\.openshift\\.io/reason"'
----
+
The command prints the following information every second:
+
* The conditions on the status of the `network.config.openshift.io/cluster` object, reporting the progress of the migration.
* The status of different nodes with respect to the `machine-config-operator` resource, including whether they are upgrading or have been upgraded, as well as their current and desired configurations.

. After the rollback procedure has completed, enter the following command to remove the `network.openshift.io/network-type-migration=` annotation from the `network.config` custom resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate network.config cluster network.openshift.io/network-type-migration-
