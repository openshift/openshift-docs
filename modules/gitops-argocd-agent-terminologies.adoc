The following definitions help you understand the required namespaces, contexts, and command-line parameters used when configuring Argo CD Agent across hub and spoke clusters.

Principal namespace::
Specifies the namespace where you install the Principal component. This namespace is not created by default, you must create it before adding the resources in this namespace. In Argo CD Agent CLI commands, this value is provided using the `--principal-namespace` flag.

Agent namespace::
Specifies the namespace hosting the `Agent` component. This namespace is not created by default, you must create it before adding the resources in this namespace. In Argo CD Agent CLI commands, this value is provided using the `--agent-namespace` flag.

Context::  
A *context* refers to a named configuration in the `oc` CLI that allows you to switch between different clusters. You must be logged in to all clusters and assign distinct context names for the hub and spoke clusters. Examples for cluster names include `principal-cluster`, `hub-cluster`, `managed-agent-cluster`, or `autonomous-agent-cluster`.

Principal context::  
The context name you provide for the hub (control plane) cluster. For example, if you log in to the hub cluster and rename its context to `principal-cluster`, you specify it in Argo CD Agent CLI commands as `--principal-context principal-cluster`.

Agent context::  
The context name you provide for the spoke (workload) cluster. For example, if you log in to a spoke cluster and rename its context to `autonomous-agent-cluster`, you specify it in Argo CD Agent CLI commands as `--agent-context autonomous-agent-cluster`.
