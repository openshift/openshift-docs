= Installing the AMQ messaging bus

To pass PTP fast event notifications between publisher and subscriber on a node, you must install and configure an AMQ messaging bus to run locally on the node. You do this by installing the AMQ Interconnect Operator for use in the cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Install the {product-title} CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

* Install the AMQ Interconnect Operator to its own `amq-interconnect` namespace. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.7/html/deploying_amq_interconnect_on_openshift/installing-router-operator-router-ocp[Installing the AMQ Interconnect Operator].

.Verification

. Check that the AMQ Interconnect Operator is available and the required pods are running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n amq-interconnect
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
amq-interconnect-645db76c76-k8ghs       1/1     Running   0          23h
interconnect-operator-5cb5fc7cc-4v7qm   1/1     Running   0          23h
----

. Check that the required `linuxptp-daemon` PTP event producer pods are running in the `openshift-ptp` namespace.

$ oc get pods -n openshift-ptp
