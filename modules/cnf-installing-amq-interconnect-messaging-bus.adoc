.Prerequisites


* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

* Install the AMQ Interconnect Operator to its own `amq-interconnect` namespace. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/2021.q1/html/deploying_amq_interconnect_on_openshift/adding-operator-router-ocp[Adding the Red Hat Integration - AMQ Interconnect Operator].

.Verification

. Check that the AMQ Interconnect Operator is available and the required pods are running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n amq-interconnect
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
amq-interconnect-645db76c76-k8ghs       1/1     Running   0          23h
interconnect-operator-5cb5fc7cc-4v7qm   1/1     Running   0          23h
----

. Check that the required `linuxptp-daemon` PTP event producer pods are running in the `openshift-ptp` namespace.
