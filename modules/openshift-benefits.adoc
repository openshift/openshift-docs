= The benefits of the OpenShift Container Platform

Red Hat was one of the early contributors of Kubernetes and quickly integrated it as the centerpiece of its OpenShift product line. Today, Red Hat continues as one of the largest contributors to Kubernetes across a wide range of technology areas. Red Hat aims to make OpenShift the premiere choice of enterprise-ready Kubernetes platforms by bringing these enhancements:

* Hybrid cloud deployments. Red Hat is cloud agnostic when it comes to OpenShift. The goal is to allow OpenShift in on-premise installations, as well as with a variety of public cloud platforms.
* Red Hat technology. Major components in OpenShift come from Red Hat Enterprise Linux and related Red Hat technologies. It leverages the intense testing and certification initiatives that go into all of Red Hat’s enterprise quality software.
* Open source development model. Development is done in the open, with source code available from public software repositories. This allows for rapid innovation and development.

Because Kubernetes doesn’t dictate the operating systems it runs on or the way that the code is deployed, where and how Kubernetes-based platforms are managed is critically important. OCP 4.x brings together a powerful set of features for installing, managing, upgrading, and using your Kubernetes-based cluster. Its components include:

* Simplified installation: OpenShift 4 aims at integrating with different cloud providers to allow someone with a particular cloud account to spin up an OpenShift cluster by just answering a few questions.
* Simplified upgrades: By locking down the systems and services running on each OpenShift node, and managing them from a central control plane, upgrades are designed to become automatic events. The goal is to, in fact, make upgrades almost non-events.
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS): RHCOS is a new container-oriented operating system that leverages the combined talents of CoreOS and Red Hat Atomic Host development teams. RHCOS is specifically designed for running containerized applications from OpenShift and works with new tools to provide fast installation, Operator-based management, and simplified upgrades.
* Operators: Operators help OpenShift replace manual upgrades of operating systems and control plane applications, OpenShift Operators such as the Cluster Version Operator and Machine Config Operator  allow simplified, cluster-wide management of those critical components. Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) and the OperatorHub provide facilities for storing and distributing Operators to people developing and deploying applications.
* CRI-O Container Engine: This streamlined container engine is developed in tandem with Kubernetes releases, to provide facilities for running, stopping, and restarting containers. It fully replaces the Docker Container Engine in OCP 4.
* Ignition: A firstboot system configuration for initially bringing up and configuring OpenShift nodes.
* Red Hat Quay Container Registry:  Most of the container images and Operators consumed by OpenShift are served from the Quay.io container registry.  Quay.io is a public registry version of Red Hat Quay, with millions of images and tags stored in it.
* Many other features: Other enhancements to Kubernetes in OpenShift include improvements in software defined networking (SDN), authentication, log aggregation, monitoring, routing, and web console and command line (oc) interfaces.

The following figure illustrates the basic flow of creating an OpenShift cluster, managing the cluster, developing and deploying applications, then scaling up those applications as needed.
