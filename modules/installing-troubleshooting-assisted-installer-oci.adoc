= Troubleshooting the installation of a cluster on {oci}

If you experience issues with using the {ai-full} to install an {product-title} cluster on {oci-first}, read the following sections to troubleshoot common problems.

== The Ingress Load Balancer in {oci} is not at a healthy status

This issue is classed as a `Warning` because by using the Resource Manager to create a stack, you created a pool of compute nodes, 3 by default, that are automatically added as backend listeners for the Ingress Load Balancer. By default, the {product-title} deploys 2 router pods, which are based on the default values from the {product-title} manifest files. The `Warning` is expected because a mismatch exists with the number of router pods available, two, to run on the three compute nodes.

.Example of a `Warning` message that is under the Backend set information tab on {oci}:

You do not need to modify the Ingress Load Balancer configuration. Instead, you can point the Ingress Load Balancer to specific compute nodes that operate in your cluster on {product-title}. To do this, use placement mechanisms, such as annotations, on {product-title} to ensure router pods only run on the compute nodes that you originally configured on the Ingress Load Balancer as backend listeners.

== {oci} create stack operation fails with an Error: 400-InvalidParameter message

On attempting to create a stack on {oci}, you identified that the *Logs* section of the job outputs an error message. For example:

[source,terminal]
----
Error: 400-InvalidParameter, DNS Label oci-demo does not follow Oracle requirements
Suggestion: Please update the parameter(s) in the Terraform config as per error message DNS Label oci-demo does not follow Oracle requirements
Documentation: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs/resources/core_vcn
----

Go to the https://console.redhat.com/openshift/assisted-installer/clusters/~new[*Install OpenShift with the Assisted Installer*] page on the Hybrid Cloud Console, and check the *Cluster name* field on the *Cluster Details* step. Remove any special characters, such as a hyphen (`-`), from the name, because these special characters are not compatible with the {oci} naming conventions. For example, change `oci-demo` to `ocidemo`.
