== Bug fixes

* Before this update, the `vector_buffer_byte_size` and `vector_buffer_events` metrics incorrectly reported negative values under certain system load and timing conditions. This led to unreliable monitoring, potentially masking buffer issues. With this update, a concurrent, centralized state tracker ensures that these metrics are always reported as non-negative values. This ensures that the metrics correctly report buffer sizes helping with accurate monitoring. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7593[LOG-7593])

*  Before this update, a change to the container image format caused issues when mirroring the images to image registries that do not support the new format. With this update, the container images are published using the older format again resolving the issue.  (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7700[LOG-7700])
