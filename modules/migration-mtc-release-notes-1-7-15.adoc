This release has the following resolved issues:

.CVE-2024-24786: A flaw was found in Golang's protobuf module, where the unmarshal function can enter an infinite loop

A flaw was found in the `protojson.Unmarshal` function that could cause the function to enter an infinite loop when unmarshaling certain forms of invalid JSON messages. This condition could occur when unmarshaling into a message that contained a `google.protobuf.Any` value or when the `UnmarshalOptions.DiscardUnknown` option was set in a JSON-formatted message.

To resolve this issue, upgrade to {mtc-short} 1.7.15.

For more details, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-24786[(CVE-2024-24786)].

.CVE-2024-28180: `jose-go` improper handling of highly compressed data

A vulnerability was found in Jose due to improper handling of highly compressed data. An attacker could send a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) encrypted message that contained compressed data that used large amounts of memory and CPU when decompressed by the `Decrypt` or `DecryptMulti` functions. 

To resolve this issue, upgrade to {mtc-short} 1.7.15.

== Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

.Direct Volume Migration is failing as the Rsync pod on the source cluster goes into an `Error` state

On migrating any application with Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), the `Stage` migration operation succeeds with warnings, and Direct Volume Migration (DVM) fails with the `rsync` pod on the source namespace going into an `error` state. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2256141[(BZ#2256141)]

.The conflict condition is briefly cleared after it is created

When creating a new state migration plan that results in a conflict error message, the error message is cleared shortly after it is displayed. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2144299[(BZ#2144299)]

.Migration fails when there are multiple Volume Snapshot Locations (VSLs) of different provider types configured in a cluster with no specified default VSL.

When there are multiple VSLs in a cluster with different provider types, and you set none of them as the default VSL, Velero results in a validation error that causes migration operations to fail. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2180565[(BZ#2180565)]
