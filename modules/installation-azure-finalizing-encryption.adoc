[id="finalizing-encryption_{context}"]
= Finalizing user-managed encryption after installation
If you installed {product-title} using a user-managed encryption key, you can complete the installation by creating a new storage class and granting write permissions to the Azure cluster resource group.

.Procedure
. Obtain the identity of the cluster resource group used by the installer:
.. If you specified an existing resource group in `install-config.yaml`, obtain its Azure identity by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ az identity list --resource-group "<existing_resource_group>"
----
.. If you did not specify a existing resource group in `install-config.yaml`, locate the resource group that the installer created, and then obtain its Azure identity by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ az group list
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ az identity list --resource-group "<installer_created_resource_group>"
----
+
. Grant a role assignment to the cluster resource group so that it can write to the Disk Encryption Set by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ az role assignment create --role "<privileged_role>" \// <1>
    --assignee "<resource_group_identity>" <2>
----
<1> Specifies an Azure role that has read/write permissions to the disk encryption set. You can use the `Owner` role or a custom role with the necessary permissions.
<2> Specifies the identity of the cluster resource group.
+
. Create a storage class that uses the user-managed disk encryption set:
.. Save the following storage class definition to a file, for example `storage-class-definition.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: managed-premium
provisioner: kubernetes.io/azure-disk
parameters:
  skuname: Premium_LRS
  kind: Managed
  diskEncryptionSetID: "<disk_encryption_set_ID>" <1>
  resourceGroup: <resource_group_name> <2>
reclaimPolicy: Delete
allowVolumeExpansion: true
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
----
<1> Specifies the ID of the disk encryption set that you created in the prerequisite steps, for example `"/subscriptions/xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx/resourceGroups/test-encryption/providers/Microsoft.Compute/diskEncryptionSets/disk-encryption-set-xxxxxx"`.
<2> Specifies the name of the resource group used by the installer. This is the same resource group from the first step.
.. Create the storage class `managed-premium` from the file you created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f storage-class-definition.yaml
----
. Select the `managed-premium` storage class when you create persistent volumes to use encrypted storage.
