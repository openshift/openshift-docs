= Understanding cluster log forwarding

The {product-title} cluster log forwarding feature uses a combination of _outputs_ and _pipelines_ defined in the Log Forwarding Custom Resource to send logs to specific endpoints inside and outside of your {product-title} cluster. 

[NOTE]
====
If you want to use only the default internal {product-title} Elasticsearch instance, do not configure any outputs and pipelines. 
==== 

An output is the destination for log data and a pipeline defines simple routing for one source to one or more outputs. 

An output can be either:

* `elasticsearch` to forward logs to an external Elasticsearch v5.x cluster, specified by server name or FQDN, and/or the internal {product-title} Elasticsearch instance. 
* `forward` to forward logs to an external log aggregation solution. This option uses the Fluentd *forward* plug-ins.

A pipeline associates the type of data to an output. A type of data you can forward is one of the following:

* `logs.app` - Container logs generated by user applications running in the cluster, except infrastructure container applications.
* `logs.infra` - Logs generated by both infrastructure components running in the cluster and {product-title} nodes, such as journal logs. Infrastructure components are pods that run in the `openshift*`, `kube*`, or `default` projects.
* `logs.audit` - Logs generated by the node audit system (auditd), which are stored in the  */var/log/audit/audit.log* file, and the audit logs from the Kubernetes apiserver and the OpenShift apiserver. 

Note the following:

* The internal {product-title} Elasticsearch instance does not provide secure storage for audit logs. We recommend you ensure that the system to which you forward audit logs is compliant with your organizational and governmental regulations and is properly secured. {product-title} cluster logging does not comply with those regulations.

* An output supports TLS communication using a secret. Secrets must have keys of: *tls.crt*, *tls.key*, and *ca-bundler.crt* which point to the respective certificates for which they represent. Secrets must have the key *shared_key* for use when using forward in a secure manner.

* You are responsible to create and maintain any additional configurations that external destinations might require, such as keys and secrets, service accounts, port opening, or global proxy configuration.

The following example creates three outputs: 

* the internal {product-title} Elasticsearch instance, 
* an unsecured externally-managed Elasticsearch instance, 
* a secured external log aggregator using the *forward* plug-in. 

Three pipelines send:

* the application logs to the internal {product-title} Elasticsearch, 
* the infrastructure logs to an external Elasticsearch instance,
* the audit logs to the secured device over the *forward* plug-in.

<1> The name of the log forwarding CR must be `instance`.
<2> Parameter to enable log forwarding. Set to `true` to enable log forwarding.
<3> Configuration for the outputs.
<4> A name to describe the output.
<5> The type of output, either `elasticsearch` or `forward`.
<6> The log forwarding endpoint, either the server name or FQDN. For the internal {product-title} Elasticsearch instance, specify `elasticsearch.openshift-logging.svc:9200`.
<7> Optional name of the secret required by the endpoint for TLS communication. The secret must exist in the `openshift-logging` project.
<8> Optional setting if the endpoint does not use a secret, resulting in insecure communication.
