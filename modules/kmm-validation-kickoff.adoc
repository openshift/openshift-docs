= Validation kickoff

Preflight validation is triggered by creating a `PreflightValidationOCP` resource in the cluster. This spec contains two fields:

[source,terminal]
----
type PreflightValidationOCPSpec struct {
	// releaseImage describes the OCP release image that all Modules need to be checked against.
	// +kubebuilder:validation:Required
	ReleaseImage string `json:"releaseImage"` <1>
	// Boolean flag that determines whether images build during preflight must also
	// be pushed to a defined repository
	// +optional
	PushBuiltImage bool `json:"pushBuiltImage"` <2>
}
----

<1> `ReleaseImage` - Mandatory field that provides the name of the release image for the {product-title} version the cluster is upgraded to.

<2> `PushBuiltImage` - If `true`, then the images created during the Build and Sign validation are pushed to their repositories (`false` by default).
