= Validation kickoff

Preflight validation is triggered by creating a `PreflightValidation` resource in the cluster.
This spec contains two fields:

`kernelVersion`:: The version of the kernel that the cluster is upgraded to. This field is required.

`pushBuiltImage`:: If `true`, then the images created during the Build and Sign validation are
pushed to their repositories. This field is `false` by default.
