= Validation kickoff

Preflight validation is triggered by creating a `PreflightValidation` resource in the cluster. This spec contains two fields:

`kernelVersion`:: Mandatory field that provides the version of the kernel that the cluster is upgraded to. 

`pushBuiltImage`:: If `true`, then the images created during the Build and Sign validation are pushed to their repositories. This field is `false` by default.
