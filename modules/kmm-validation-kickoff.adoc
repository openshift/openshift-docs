= Validation kickoff

Preflight validation is triggered by creating a `PreflightValidationOCP` resource in the cluster. This spec contains two fields:

`releaseImage`:: Mandatory field that provides the name of the release image for the {product-title} version the cluster is upgraded to.

`pushBuiltImage`:: If `true`, then the images created during the Build and Sign validation are pushed to their repositories. This field is `false` by default.
