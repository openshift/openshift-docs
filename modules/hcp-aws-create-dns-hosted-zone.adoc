= Creating the public DNS hosted zone

The External DNS Operator uses the public DNS hosted zone to create your public hosted cluster.

You can create the public DNS hosted zone to use as the external DNS domain-filter. Complete the following steps in the AWS Route 53 management console.

.Procedure

. In the Route 53 management console, click *Create hosted zone*.

. On the *Hosted zone configuration* page, type a domain name, verify that *Publish hosted zone* is selected as the type, and click *Create hosted zone*.

. After the zone is created, on the *Records* tab, note the values in the *Value/Route traffic to* column.

. In the main domain, create an NS record to redirect the DNS requests to the delegated zone. In the *Value* field, enter the values that you noted in the previous step.

. Click *Create records*.

. Verify that the DNS hosted zone is working by creating a test entry in the new subzone and testing it with a `dig` command, such as in the following example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ dig +short test.user-dest-public.aws.kerberos.com
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
192.168.1.1
----

. To create a hosted cluster that sets the hostname for the `LoadBalancer` and `Route` services, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ hcp create cluster aws --name=<hosted_cluster_name> --endpoint-access=PublicAndPrivate --external-dns-domain=<public_hosted_zone> ... <1>
----
+
<1> Replace `<public_hosted_zone>` with the public hosted zone that you created.
+

The Control Plane Operator creates the `Services` and `Routes` resources and annotates them with the `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname` annotation. For `Services` and `Routes`, the Control Plane Operator uses a value of the `hostname` parameter in the `servicePublishingStrategy` field for the service endpoints. To create the DNS records, you can use a mechanism, such as the `external-dns` deployment.

You can configure service-level DNS indirection for public services only. You cannot set `hostname` for private services because they use the `hypershift.local` private zone.

The following table shows when it is valid to set `hostname` for a service and endpoint combinations:
