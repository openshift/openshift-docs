= Understanding TLS profiles

You can use a TLS (Transport Layer Security) profile to define which TLS ciphers are required by the kubelet when it is acting as an HTTP server. The kubelet uses its HTTP/GRPC server to communicate with the Kubernetes API server, which sends commands to pods, gathers logs, and run exec commands on pods through the kubelet.

A TLS profile defines the TLS ciphers that the Kubernetes API server must use when connecting with the kubelet to protect communication between the kubelet and the Kubernetes API server.

You can specify one of the following TLS security profile types:

[NOTE]
====
When using the Old, Intermediate, and Modern profile types, the effective profile configuration is subject to change between releases. For example, given a specification to use the Intermediate profile deployed on release X.Y.Z, an upgrade to release X.Y.Z+1 may cause a new profile configuration to be applied to the Ingress controller, resulting in a rollout.

* `Old`. This is a predefined profile intended for use with legacy clients or libraries. The profile is based on link:https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Recommended_configurations[recommended configurations].
+
The `Old` profile uses the following TLS cipher suites and requires a minimum TLS version of 1.0:
+

* TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
* TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
* TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
* TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
* TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
* TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256

* `Intermediate`. This is a predefined profile, which is the default TLS security profile for the kubelet. The profile is based on link:https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Recommended_configurations[recommended configurations].
+
The `Intermediate` profile uses the following TLS cipher suites and requires a minimum TLS version of 1.2:
+
--
* TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
* TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
* TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
* TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
* TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256,
* TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
--

* `Modern` This is a predefined profile for use with modern clients that have no need for backwards compatibility.
+
The `Intermediate` profile uses the following TLS cipher suites and requires a minimum TLS version of 1.2:
+
--
*

+
[NOTE]
====
The `Modern` TLS profile is available for the Ingress controller only.
====

* `Custom`. This profile allows you to define the TLS ciphers and version to use.
+
[WARNING]
====
Use caution when using a `Custom` profile, because invalid configurations can cause problems.
