= Understanding TLS security profiles

You can use a TLS (Transport Layer Security) security profile to define which TLS ciphers are required by various {product-title} components. The {product-title} TLS security profiles are based on link:https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS[Mozilla recommended configurations].

You can specify one of the following TLS security profiles for each component:

.TLS security profiles
[cols="1,2a",options="header"]
|===
|Profile
|Description

|`Old`
|This profile is intended for use with legacy clients or libraries. The profile is based on the link:https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Old_backward_compatibility[Old backward compatibility] recommended configuration.

The `Old` profile requires a minimum TLS version of 1.0.

[NOTE]
====
For the Ingress Controller, the minimum TLS version is converted from 1.0 to 1.1.
====

|`Intermediate`
|This profile is the recommended configuration for the majority of clients. It is the  default TLS security profile for the Ingress Controller, kubelet, and control plane. The profile is based on the link:https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Intermediate_compatibility_.28recommended.29[Intermediate compatibility] recommended configuration.

The `Intermediate` profile requires a minimum TLS version of 1.2.

|`Modern`
|This profile is intended for use with modern clients that have no need for backwards compatibility. This profile is based on the link:https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Modern_compatibility[Modern compatibility] recommended configuration.

The `Modern` profile requires a minimum TLS version of 1.3.
[NOTE]
====
In {product-title} 4.6, 4.7, and 4.8, the `Modern` profile is unsupported. If selected, the `Intermediate` profile is enabled.
====

|`Custom`
|This profile allows you to define the TLS version and ciphers to use.

[WARNING]
====
Use caution when using a `Custom` profile, because invalid configurations can cause problems.
====
|===

[NOTE]
====
When using one of the predefined profile types, the effective profile configuration is subject to change between releases. For example, given a specification to use the Intermediate profile deployed on release X.Y.Z, an upgrade to release X.Y.Z+1 might cause a new profile configuration to be applied, resulting in a rollout.
====

// TODO: Make sure all this is captured somewhere as necessary
// [IMPORTANT]
// ====
// The HAProxy Ingress Controller image does not support TLS `1.3` and because the `Modern` profile requires TLS `1.3`, it is not supported. The Ingress Operator converts the `Modern` profile to `Intermediate`.
//
// The Ingress Operator also converts the TLS `1.0` of an `Old` or `Custom` profile to `1.1`, and TLS `1.3` of a `Custom` profile to `1.2`.
