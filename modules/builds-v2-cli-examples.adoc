Write a short introductory paragraph that provides an overview of the module. The text that immediately follows the `[role="_abstract"]` tag is used for search metadata. A reference module provides data that users might want to look up, but do not need to remember.
It has a very strict structure, often in the form of a list or a table.
A well-organized reference module enables users to scan it quickly to find the details they want.
AsciiDoc markup to consider for reference data:

.Unordered list

* Use a consistent system for file names, IDs, and titles.
