= Specifying GPU resource requirements for a Knative service

After GPU resources are enabled for your {product-title} cluster, you can specify GPU requirements for a Knative service using the `kn` CLI.

[NOTE]
====
Services do not share GPU resources. Any other services that require GPU resources must wait until the GPU resource is no longer in use.
====

.Procedure

You can specify a GPU resource requirement when you create a Knative service using `kn`.

* Create a service and set the GPU resource requirement:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn service create <service_name> --image <image_url> --limit <gpu_resource_requirement>
----
+
You can set the GPU resource requirement limit to `1` by using `nvidia.com/gpu=1`.
+
.Example command
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn service create event-display --image quay.io/openshift-knative/knative-eventing-sources-event-display:latest --limit nvidia.com/gpu=1
----
+
A GPU resource requirement limit of `1` means that the service has 1 GPU resource dedicated, and that applications exceeding usage of 1 GPU resource are restricted.
+
If a service requests more than 1 GPU resource, it is deployed on a node where the GPU resource requirements can be met.
