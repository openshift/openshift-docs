= Creating {oadp-short} resources for the image-based upgrade with {ztp}

Prepare your {oadp-short} resources to restore your application after an upgrade.

.Prerequisites

* Provision one or more managed clusters with {ztp}.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Generate a seed image from a compatible seed cluster.
* Create a separate partition on the target cluster for the container images that is shared between stateroots. For more information, see "Configuring a shared container partition between ostree stateroots when using {ztp}".
* Deploy a version of {lcao} that is compatible with the version used with the seed image.
* Install the {oadp-short} Operator, the `DataProtectionApplication` CR, and its secret on the target cluster.
* Create an S3-compatible storage solution and a ready-to-use bucket with proper credentials configured. For more information, see "Installing and configuring the {oadp-short} Operator with {ztp}".
* The `openshift-adp` namespace for the OADP `ConfigMap` object must exist on all managed clusters and the hub for the OADP `ConfigMap` to be generated and copied to the clusters.

.Procedure

. Ensure that your Git repository that you use with the ArgoCD policies application contains the following directory structure:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
├── source-crs/
│   ├── ibu/
│   │    ├── ImageBasedUpgrade.yaml
│   │    ├── PlatformBackupRestore.yaml
│   │    ├── PlatformBackupRestoreLvms.yaml
│   │    ├── PlatformBackupRestoreWithIBGU.yaml
├── ...
├── kustomization.yaml
----

The `source-crs/ibu/PlatformBackupRestoreWithIBGU.yaml` file is provided in the ZTP container image.

.PlatformBackupRestoreWithIBGU.yaml
include::snippets/ibu-PlatformBackupRestoreWithIBGU.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
If you perform the image-based upgrade directly on managed clusters, use the `PlatformBackupRestore.yaml` file.
====

If you use {lvms} to create persistent volumes, you can use the `source-crs/ibu/PlatformBackupRestoreLvms.yaml` provided in the ZTP container image to back up your {lvms} resources.

.PlatformBackupRestoreLvms.yaml
include::snippets/ibu-PlatformBackupRestoreLvms.adoc[]
--

. If you need to restore applications after the upgrade, create the {oadp-short} `Backup` and `Restore` CRs for your application in the `openshift-adp` namespace:

.. Create the {oadp-short} CRs for cluster-scoped application artifacts in the `openshift-adp` namespace:
+
.Example {oadp-short} CRs for cluster-scoped application artifacts for LSO and {LVMS}
include::snippets/ibu-ApplicationClusterScopedBackupRestore.adoc[]

.. Create the {oadp-short} CRs for your namespace-scoped application artifacts in the `source-crs/custom-crs` directory:
+
--
.Example {oadp-short} CRs namespace-scoped application artifacts when LSO is used
include::snippets/ibu-ApplicationBackupRestoreLso.adoc[]

.Example {oadp-short} CRs namespace-scoped application artifacts when {lvms} is used
include::snippets/ibu-ApplicationBackupRestoreLvms.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The same version of the applications must function on both the current and the target release of {product-title}.
====
--

. Create a `kustomization.yaml` with the following content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

configMapGenerator: # <1>
- files:
  - source-crs/ibu/PlatformBackupRestoreWithIBGU.yaml
  #- source-crs/custom-crs/ApplicationClusterScopedBackupRestore.yaml
  #- source-crs/custom-crs/ApplicationApplicationBackupRestoreLso.yaml
  name: oadp-cm
  namespace: openshift-adp # <2>
generatorOptions:
  disableNameSuffixHash: true
----
<1> Creates the `oadp-cm` `ConfigMap` object on the hub cluster with `Backup` and `Restore` CRs.
<2> The namespace must exist on all managed clusters and the hub for the OADP `ConfigMap` to be generated and copied to the clusters.

. Push the changes to your Git repository.
