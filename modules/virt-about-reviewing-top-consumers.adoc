= About reviewing top consumers

In the {VirtProductName} dashboard, you can select a specific time period and view the top consumers of resources within that time period. Top consumers are virtual machines or `virt-launcher` pods that are consuming the highest amount of resources.

The following table shows resources monitored in the dashboard and describes the metrics associated with each resource for top consumers.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|*Monitored resources* | *Description*
|Memory swap traffic
|Virtual machines consuming the most memory pressure when swapping memory.
|vCPU wait
|Virtual machines experiencing the maximum wait time (in seconds) for their vCPUs.
|CPU usage by pod
|The `virt-launcher` pods that are using the most CPU.
|Network traffic
|Virtual machines that are saturating the network by receiving the most amount of network traffic (in bytes).
|Storage traffic
|Virtual machines with the highest amount (in bytes) of storage-related traffic.
|Storage IOPS
|Virtual machines with the highest amount of I/O operations per second over a time period.
|Memory usage
|The `virt-launcher` pods that are using the most memory (in bytes).

[NOTE]
====
Viewing the maximum resource consumption is limited to the top five consumers.
