= Machine Config Operator

The Machine Config Operator enables system definitions and low-level system settings such as workload partitioning, NTP, and SCTP. This Operator is installed with  {product-title}.

A performance profile and its created products are applied to a node according to an associated machine config pool (MCP). The MCP holds valuable information about the progress of applying the machine configurations created by performance addons that encompass kernel args, kube config, huge pages allocation, and deployment of the realtime kernel (rt-kernel). The performance addons controller monitors changes in the MCP and updates the performance profile status accordingly.
