= Configuring your AWS account

To configure your AWS account to use the ROSA service, complete the following steps.

.Prerequisites

* Review and complete the deployment prerequisites and policies.
* Create a link:https://cloud.redhat.com[Red Hat account], if you do not already have one. Then, check your email for a verification link. You will need these credentials to install ROSA.

.Procedure

. Log in to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) account that you want to use.
+
A dedicated AWS account is recommended to run production clusters. If you are using AWS Organizations, you can use an AWS account within your organization or link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html#orgs_manage_accounts_create-new[create a new one].
+
If you are using AWS Organizations and you need to have a service control policy (SCP) applied to the AWS account you plan to use, see AWS Prerequisites for details on the minimum required SCP.
+
As part of the cluster creation process, `rosa` establishes an `osdCcsAdmin` IAM user. This user uses the IAM credentials you provide when configuring the AWS CLI.
+
[NOTE]
====
This user has `Programmatic` access enabled and the `AdministratorAccess` policy attached to it.
====
+
. Enable the ROSA service in the AWS Console.
.. Sign in to your link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/rosa/home[AWS account].
.. To enable ROSA, go to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/rosa/[ROSA service] and select *Enable OpenShift*.

. Install and configure the AWS CLI.
.. Follow the AWS command-line interface documentation to link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html[install] and link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html[configure] the AWS CLI for your operating system.
+
Specify the correct `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key` in the `.aws/credentials` file. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html[AWS Configuration basics] in the AWS documentation.

.. Set a default AWS region.
+
[NOTE]
====
It is recommended to set the default AWS region by using the environment variable.
====
+
The ROSA service evaluates regions in the following priority order:
+
... The region specified when running the `rosa` command with the `--region` flag.
... The region set in the `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html[Environment variables to configure the AWS CLI] in the AWS documentation.
... The default region set in your AWS configuration file. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-config[Quick configuration with aws configure] in the AWS documentation.
.. Optional: Configure your AWS CLI settings and credentials by using an AWS named profile. `rosa` evaluates AWS named profiles in the following priority order:
... The profile specified when running the `rosa` command with the `--profile` flag.
... The profile set in the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html[Named profiles] in the AWS documentation.
.. Verify the AWS CLI is installed and configured correctly by running the following command to query the AWS API:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws sts get-caller-identity

After completing these steps, install ROSA.
