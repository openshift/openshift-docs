=== Creating a new virtual machine using the web console

The {ProductName} user interface is a specific build of the {product-title} web 
console that contains the core features needed for virtualization use cases, 
including a virtualization navigation item. 

NOTE: `kubevirt-web-ui` is installed by default during the `kubevirt-apb` 
deployment.

You can create a new virtual machine from the {ProductName} web console. The VM 
can be configured with an interactive wizard, or you can bring your own YAML file.

.Prerequisites

* A cluster running {product-title} 3.11 or newer
* {ProductName}, version 1.3 or newer

.Procedure

. Access the web UI at
`kubevirt-web-ui.your.app.subdomain.host.com`. Log in by using your
{product-title} credentials.

. Open the *Workloads* menu and select the *Virtual Machines*
menu item. The list of available virtual machines will be shown.

. Click *Create Virtual Machine* and you will be
presented with two options:
[horizontal]
*Create with YAML*:: allows you to paste and submit a YAML file describing the VM.
*Create with Wizard*:: takes you through the process of VM creation.

. Select *Create with Wizard*. Input the desired VM name, description, and 
namespace where you want the VM to be created.

. Next, select the provisioning source from the following options:
[horizontal]
`PXE`:: The virtual machine will be booted over the network. The network
interface and logical network will be configured later in the
*Networking* tab.
`URL`:: Provide the address of a disk image accessible from 
{product-title}. RAW and QCOW2 formats are supported. Either 
format may be compressed with `gzip` or `xz`.
`Registry`:: Provide a container containing a bootable operating system in a
registry accessible from {product-title}. A `registryDisk` 
volume is ephemeral, and the volume will be discarded when the virtual machine 
is stopped, restarted, or deleted.
* Example: `kubevirt/fedora-cloud-registry-disk-demo`
`Template`:: Create a new virtual machine from a VM template that you imported 
by using the `Import VM` APB. No other templates are supported.

. Next, select the operating system, flavor, and workload profile
for the VM. If you want to use cloud-init or start the virtual machine on 
creation, select those options. Then, proceed to the next screen.

. On the networking screen, you can create, delete or rearrange
network interfaces. The interfaces can be connected to the logical
network using `NetworkAttachmentDefinition`. If you don’t need to configure 
networking, you can skip this step and create the VM.

. On the storage screen, you can create, delete or rearrange the virtual 
machine disks. Please note that if you want to attach a PVC from this screen, 
it must already exist. If you don’t need to configure storage, you can skip 
this step and create the VM.

. Once you have created the VM, it will be visible under
*Workloads > Virtual Machines*. You can start the new VM from the
"cog" icon to the left of the VM entry. To see additional details
about the VM, click its name.

. To interact with the operating system, click the *Consoles*
tab. This will connect to the VNC console of the virtual machine.
