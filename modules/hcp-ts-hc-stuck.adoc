= HostedCluster resource is stuck in a partial state

If a hosted control plane is not coming fully online because a `HostedCluster` resource is pending, identify the problem by checking prerequisites, resource conditions, and node and Operator status.

.Procedure

* Ensure that you meet all of the prerequisites for a hosted cluster on {VirtProductName}.
* View the conditions on the `HostedCluster` and `NodePool` resources for validation errors that prevent progress.
* By using the `kubeconfig` file of the hosted cluster, inspect the status of the hosted cluster:

** View the output of the `oc get clusteroperators` command to see which cluster Operators are pending.
** View the output of the `oc get nodes` command to ensure that worker nodes are ready.
