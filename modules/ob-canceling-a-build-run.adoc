= Build run cancellation

You can cancel an active `BuildRun` instance by setting its state to `BuildRunCanceled`. When you cancel a `BuildRun` instance, the underlying `TaskRun` resource is also marked as canceled.

The following example shows a canceled build run for a `BuildRun` resource:

[source,yaml]

apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1beta1

  name: buildah-buildrun
spec:
  # [...]
  state: "BuildRunCanceled"
