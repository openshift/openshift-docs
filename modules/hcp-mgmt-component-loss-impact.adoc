= Impact of the failed management cluster component

If the management cluster component fails, your workload remains unaffected. In the {product-title} management cluster, the control plane is decoupled from the data plane to provide resiliency.

The following table covers the impact of a failed management cluster component on the control plane and the data plane. However, the table does not cover all scenarios for the management cluster component failures.
