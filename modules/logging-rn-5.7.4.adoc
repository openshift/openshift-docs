== Bug fixes
* Before this update, when forwarding logs to CloudWatch, a `namespaceUUID` value was not appended to the `logGroupName` field. With this update, the `namespaceUUID` value is included, so a `logGroupName` in CloudWatch appears as `logGroupName: vectorcw.b443fb9e-bd4c-4b6a-b9d3-c0097f9ed286`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2701[LOG-2701])

* Before this update, when forwarding logs over HTTP to an off-cluster destination, the Vector collector was unable to authenticate to the cluster-wide HTTP proxy even though correct credentials were provided in the proxy URL. With this update, the Vector log collector can now authenticate to the cluster-wide HTTP proxy. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3381[LOG-3381])

* Before this update, the Operator would fail if the Fluentd collector was configured with Splunk as an output, due to this configuration being unsupported. With this update, configuration validation rejects unsupported outputs, resolving the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4237[LOG-4237])

* Before this update, when the Vector collector was updated an `enabled = true` value in the TLS configuration for AWS Cloudwatch logs and the GCP Stackdriver caused a configuration error. With this update, `enabled = true` value will be removed for these outputs, resolving the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4242[LOG-4242])

* Before this update, the Vector collector occasionally panicked with the following error message in its log:
`thread 'vector-worker' panicked at 'all branches are disabled and there is no else branch', src/kubernetes/reflector.rs:26:9`. With this update, the error has been resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4275[LOG-4275])

* Before this update, an issue in the {loki-op} caused the `alert-manager` configuration for the application tenant to disappear if the Operator was configured with additional options for that tenant. With this update, the generated Loki configuration now contains both the custom and the auto-generated configuration. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4361[LOG-4361])

* Before this update, when multiple roles were used to authenticate using STS with AWS Cloudwatch forwarding, a recent update caused the credentials to be non-unique. With this update, multiple combinations of STS roles and static credentials can once again be used to authenticate with AWS Cloudwatch. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4368[LOG-4368])

* Before this update, Loki filtered label values for active streams but did not remove duplicates, making Grafana's Label Browser unusable. With this update, Loki filters out duplicate label values for active streams, resolving the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4389[LOG-4389])

* Pipelines with no `name` field specified in the `ClusterLogForwarder` custom resource (CR) stopped working after upgrading to OpenShift Logging 5.7. With this update, the error has been resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4120[LOG-4120])
