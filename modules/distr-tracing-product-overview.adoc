= OpenShift distributed tracing overview

As a service owner, you can use distributed tracing to instrument your services to gather insights into your service architecture.
You can use distributed tracing for monitoring, network profiling, and troubleshooting the interaction between components in modern, cloud-native, microservices-based applications.

Using distributed tracing lets you perform the following functions:

* Monitor distributed transactions

* Optimize performance and latency

* Perform root cause analysis

{ProductName} consists of two components:

* *Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform* - This component is based on the open source link:https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger project].

* *Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing data collection* - This component is based on the open source link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry project].

Both of these components are based on the vendor-neutral link:https://opentracing.io/[OpenTracing] APIs and instrumentation.
