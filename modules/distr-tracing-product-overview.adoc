= {DTProductName} overview

As a service owner, you can use distributed tracing to instrument your services to gather insights into your service architecture.
You can use {DTShortName} for monitoring, network profiling, and troubleshooting the interaction between components in modern, cloud-native, microservices-based applications.

Using {DTShortName} lets you perform the following functions:

* Monitor distributed transactions

* Optimize performance and latency

* Perform root cause analysis

{DTProductName} consists of two main components:

* *{JaegerName}* - This component is based on the open source link:https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger project].

* *{OTELNAME}* - This component is based on the open source link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry project].

Both of these components are based on the vendor-neutral link:https://opentracing.io/[OpenTracing] APIs and instrumentation.
