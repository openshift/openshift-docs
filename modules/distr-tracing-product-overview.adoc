= Distributed tracing overview

As a service owner, you can use distributed tracing to instrument your services to gather insights into your service architecture.
You can use the {DTProductName} for monitoring, network profiling, and troubleshooting the interaction between components in modern, cloud-native, microservices-based applications.

With the {DTShortName}, you can perform the following functions:

* Monitor distributed transactions

* Optimize performance and latency

* Perform root cause analysis

The {DTShortName} consists of three components:

* *{JaegerName}*, which is based on the open source link:https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger project].

* *{TempoName}*, which is based on the open source link:https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/[Grafana Tempo project].

* *{OTELNAME}*, which is based on the open source link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry project].

Jaeger does not use FIPS validated cryptographic modules.
