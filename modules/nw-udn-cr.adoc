= Creating a UserDefinedNetwork custom resource

The following procedure sets up a user-defined network that is namespace scoped.

//We won't have these pieces till GA in 4.18.
//[NOTE]
//====
//If any cluster default networked pods exist before the user-defined network is created, any further pods created in this namespace will return an error message: `What_is_this`.
//====

.Procedure

. Create a request for a user-defined network:

.. Create a YAML file, such as `my-udn-request.yaml`, to define your request with content as in the following example:
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: UserDefinedNetwork
metadata:
  name: udn-1 # <1>
  namespace: <some_custom_namespace>
spec:
  topology: Layer2 # <2>
  layer2: <3>
    role: Primary # <4>
    mtu: 9000 # <5>
    subnets:
      - "10.0.0.0/24"
      - "2001:db8::/64" # <6>
    JoinSubnets: [] # <7>
    IPAMLifecycle: Persistent # <8>

<1> Name of your `UserDefinedNetwork` resource. This should not be `default` or duplicate any global namespaces created by the Cluster Network Operator (CNO).
<2> The `topology` field describes the network configuration, accepted values are `Layer2` and `Layer3`. `Layer3` topology creates a layer 2 segment per node, each with a different subnet. Layer 3 routing is used to interconnect node subnets. `Layer2` topology creates one logical switch shared by all nodes.
<3> This field specifies the topology configuration, it can be `layer2` or `layer3`.
<4> Specifies `Primary` or `Secondary`. `Primary` is the only `role` specification supported in {product-version}.
<5> The maximum transmission units (MTU) is an optional field. The default value is `1400`. The boundary for IPv4 is 574, and for IPv6 it is 1280.
<6> Specifies the subnet to be used for the network across the cluster. Supports both IPv6 and dual-stack. For example, `192.168.100.0/24`,`2001:DBB::/64`. Dual-stack may set two subnets otherwise only one is allowed. When the `topology` field is set to `Layer3`, the subnet is split into smaller subnets for every node. Accepted format for subnets when `Layer3` is set are: `172.16.0.0/16/24`. For `Layer2` values in `topology` field, standard CIDR ranges are accepted. If omitted the network only provides `Layer2` communication and you must configure IP addresses.
<7> Specifies the `subnets` used inside the OVN-Kubernetes network topology. If omitted, the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin assigns one, which is subject to change over time.
<8> Specifies the IP address management system (IPAM). This field is optional and allowed when `topology` is `layer2`. The
`subnets` field must be specified when this field is specified. The `Persistent` value specifies that workloads have persistent IP addresses. Assigned by the container network interface (CNI) and used by OVN-Kubernetes to program pod IP addresses. You must not change this for pod annotations.

.. Apply your request by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f my-udn-request.yaml
----

. Verify that your request is successful by running the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc get userdefinednetworks udn-1 -n default -o yaml
----
+
