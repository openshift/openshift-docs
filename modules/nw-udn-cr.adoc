= Creating a UserDefinedNetwork CR by using the CLI

The following procedure creates a `UserDefinedNetwork` CR that is namespace scoped. Based upon your use case, create your request by using either the `my-layer-two-udn.yaml` example for a `Layer2` topology type or the `my-layer-three-udn.yaml` example for a `Layer3` topology type.

//We won't have these pieces till GA in 4.18.
//[NOTE]
//====
//If any cluster default networked pods exist before the user-defined network is created, any further pods created in this namespace will return an error message: `What_is_this`?
//====

.Procedure

. Optional: For a `UserDefinedNetwork` CR that uses a primary network, create a namespace with the `k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network` label by entering the following command:
+
[source,yaml]
----
$ cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: <udn_namespace_name>      
  labels:
    k8s.ovn.org/primary-user-defined-network: ""
EOF
----

. Create a request for either a `Layer2` or `Layer3` topology type user-defined network:

.. Create a YAML file, such as `my-layer-two-udn.yaml`, to define your request for a `Layer2` topology as in the following example:
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: UserDefinedNetwork
metadata:
  name: udn-1 # <1>
  namespace: <some_custom_namespace>
spec:
  topology: Layer2 # <2>
  layer2: <3>
    role: Primary # <4>
    subnets:
      - "10.0.0.0/24"
      - "2001:db8::/60" # <5>
----
<1> Name of your `UserDefinedNetwork` resource. This should not be `default` or duplicate any global namespaces created by the Cluster Network Operator (CNO).
<2> The `topology` field describes the network configuration; accepted values are `Layer2` and `Layer3`. Specifying a `Layer2` topology type creates one logical switch that is shared by all nodes.
<3> This field specifies the topology configuration. It can be `layer2` or `layer3`.
<4> Specifies a `Primary` or `Secondary` role.
<5> For `Layer2` topology types the following specifies config details for the `subnet` field:
+
* The subnets field is optional.
* The subnets field is of type `string` and accepts standard CIDR formats for both IPv4 and IPv6.
* The subnets field accepts one or two items. For two items, they must be of a different family. For example, subnets values of `10.100.0.0/16` and `2001:db8::/64`.
* `Layer2` subnets can be omitted. If omitted, users must configure IP addresses for the pods. As a consequence, port security only prevents MAC spoofing.
* The `Layer2` `subnets` field is mandatory when the `ipamLifecycle` field is specified.
+
.. Create a YAML file, such as `my-layer-three-udn.yaml`, to define your request for a `Layer3` topology as in the following example:
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: UserDefinedNetwork
metadata:
  name: udn-2-primary # <1>
  namespace: <some_custom_namespace>
spec:
  topology: Layer3 # <2>
  layer3: # <3>
    role: Primary # <4>
    subnets: # <5>
      - cidr: 10.150.0.0/16
        hostSubnet: 24
      - cidr: 2001:db8::/60
        hostSubnet: 64
# ...
----
<1> Name of your `UserDefinedNetwork` resource. This should not be `default` or duplicate any global namespaces created by the Cluster Network Operator (CNO).
<2> The `topology` field describes the network configuration; accepted values are `Layer2` and `Layer3`. Specifying a `Layer3` topology type creates a layer 2 segment per node, each with a different subnet. Layer 3 routing is used to interconnect node subnets.
<3> This field specifies the topology configuration. Valid values are `layer2` or `layer3`.
<4> Specifies a `Primary` or `Secondary` role.
<5> For `Layer3` topology types the following specifies config details for the `subnet` field:
+
* The `subnets` field is mandatory.
* The type for the `subnets` field is `cidr` and `hostSubnet`:
** `cidr` is equivalent to the `clusterNetwork` configuration settings of a cluster. The IP addresses in the CIDR are distributed to pods in the user defined network. This parameter accepts a string value.
** `hostSubnet` defines the per-node subnet prefix.
** For IPv6, only a `/64` length is supported for `hostSubnet`.

. Apply your request by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <my_layer_two_udn>.yaml
----
+
Where `<my_layer_two_udn>.yaml` is the name of your `Layer2` or `Layer3` configuration file.

. Verify that your request is successful by running the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc get userdefinednetworks udn-1 -n <some_custom_namespace> -o yaml
----
+
Where `some_custom_namespace` is the namespace you created for your user-defined network.
