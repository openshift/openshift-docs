= Upgrade changes from version 2.0 to version 2.1

Upgrading the control plane from version 2.0 to 2.1 introduces the following architectural and behavioral changes.

.Architecture changes

Mixer has been completely removed in {SMProductName} 2.1. Upgrading from a {SMProductName} 2.0.x release to 2.1 will be blocked if Mixer is enabled.

[id="ossm-upgrading-differences-behavior_{context}"]
.Behavioral changes

* `AuthorizationPolicy` updates:
** With the PROXY protocol, if you're using `ipBlocks` and `notIpBlocks` to specify remote IP addresses, update the configuration to use `remoteIpBlocks` and `notRemoteIpBlocks` instead.
** Added support for nested JSON Web Token (JWT) claims.
* `EnvoyFilter` breaking changes>
** Must use `typed_config`
** xDS v2 is no longer supported
** Deprecated filter names
* Older versions of proxies may report 503 status codes when receiving 1xx or 204 status codes from newer proxies.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat is unable to support `EnvoyFilter` configuration except where explicitly documented. This is due to tight coupling with the underlying Envoy APIs, meaning that backward compatibility cannot be maintained.
