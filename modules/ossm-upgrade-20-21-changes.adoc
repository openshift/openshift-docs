= Upgrade changes from version 2.0 to version 2.1

Upgrading the {SMProductShortName} control plane from version 2.0 to 2.1 introduces the following architectural and behavioral changes.

.Architecture changes

Mixer has been completely removed in {SMProductName} 2.1. Upgrading from a {SMProductName} 2.0.x release to 2.1 will be blocked if Mixer is enabled.

If you see the following message when upgrading from v2.0 to v2.1, update the existing `Mixer` type to `Istiod` type in the existing Control Plane spec before you update the `.spec.version` field:

[source,text]
----
An error occurred

For example:
