[id="deprecated-features-1-8_{context}"]
== Deprecated and removed features

* Support for the `tekton.dev/v1alpha1` API version, which was deprecated in {pipelines-title} GA 1.6, is planned to be removed in the upcoming {pipelines-title} GA 1.9 release.
+
This change affects the pipeline component, which includes the `TaskRun`, `PipelineRun`, `Task`, `Pipeline`, and similar `tekton.dev/v1alpha1` resources. As an alternative, update existing resources to use `apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1` as described in link:https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/migrating-v1alpha1-to-v1beta1/[Migrating From Tekton v1alpha1 to Tekton v1beta1].
+
Bug fixes and support for the `tekton.dev/v1alpha1` API version are provided only through the end of the current GA 1.8 lifecycle.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
For the *Tekton Operator*, the `operator.tekton.dev/v1alpha1` API version is *not* deprecated. You do not need to make changes to this value.

* In {pipelines-title} 1.8, the `PipelineResource` custom resource (CR) is available but no longer supported. The `PipelineResource` CR was a Tech Preview feature and part of the `tekton.dev/v1alpha1` API, which had been deprecated and planned to be removed in the upcoming {pipelines-title} GA 1.9 release.

* In {pipelines-title} 1.8, the `Condition` custom resource (CR) is removed. The `Condition` CR was part of the `tekton.dev/v1alpha1` API, which has been deprecated and is planned to be removed in the upcoming {pipelines-title} GA 1.9 release.

[id="known-issues-1-8_{context}"]
== Known issues

* The `s2i-nodejs` pipeline cannot use the `nodejs:14-ubi8-minimal` image stream to perform source-to-image (S2I) builds. Using that image stream produces an `error building at STEP "RUN /usr/libexec/s2i/assemble": exit status 127` message.
+
Workaround: Use `nodejs:14-ubi8` instead of the `nodejs:14-ubi8-minimal` image stream.
// (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SRVKP-1782[#SRVKP-1782])
// Writer, also see https://github.com/tektoncd/operator/blob/main/cmd/openshift/operator/kodata/tekton-addon/addons/02-clustertasks/source_local/s2i-nodejs/s2i-nodejs-task.yaml. Overkill: The user can run the `$ oc edit clustertask s2i-nodejs` command and replace `$(params.VERSION)` with `14-ubi8`. Alternatively, you can use a `TaskRun` resource to set the tag of the `nodejs` image stream to `14-ubi8`.
