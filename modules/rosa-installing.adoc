= Installing and configuring the ROSA CLI

Install and configure the {product-title} (ROSA) CLI, `rosa`. You can also install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) and verify if the required AWS resource quotas are available by using the ROSA CLI (`rosa`).

.Prerequisites

* Review and complete the AWS prerequisites and ROSA policies.
* Create a link:https://cloud.redhat.com[Red Hat account], if you do not already have one. Then, check your email for a verification link. You will need these credentials to install ROSA.
* Configure your AWS account and enable the ROSA service in your AWS account.

.Procedure

. Install `rosa`, the {product-title} command-line interface (CLI).
.. Download the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads[latest release] of the ROSA CLI for your operating system.
.. Optional: Rename the executable file you downloaded to `rosa`. This documentation uses `rosa` to refer to the executable file.
.. Optional: Add `rosa` to your path.

----
$ mv rosa /usr/local/bin/rosa
----
.. Enter the following command to verify your installation:

.. Optional: Generate the command completion scripts for the ROSA CLI. The following example generates the Bash completion scripts for a Linux machine:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/rosa
----
.. Optional: Enable command completion for the ROSA CLI from your existing terminal. The following example enables Bash completion for `rosa` in an existing terminal on a Linux machine:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ source /etc/bash_completion.d/rosa
----

. Log in to your Red Hat account with `rosa`.
+
.. Enter the following command.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa login
----
+
.. Replace `<my_offline_access_token>` with your token.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
To login to your Red Hat account, get an offline access token at https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token/rosa
? Copy the token and paste it here: <my-offline-access-token>
----

.Example output continued
[source,terminal]

. Enter the following command to verify that your AWS account has the necessary permissions.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa verify permissions
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
I: Validating SCP policies...
I: AWS SCP policies ok
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This command verifies permissions only for ROSA clusters that do not use the AWS Security Token Service (STS).
====

. Verify that your AWS account has the necessary quota to deploy an {product-title} cluster.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa verify quota --region=us-west-2
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
I: Validating AWS quota...
I: AWS quota ok
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Sometimes your AWS quota varies by region. If you receive any errors, try a different region.
====
+
If you need to increase your quota, go to your link:https://aws.amazon.com/console/[AWS console], and request a quota increase for the service that failed.
+
After both the permissions and quota checks pass, proceed to the next step.
+
. Prepare your AWS account for cluster deployment:
+
.. Run the following command to verify your Red Hat and AWS credentials are setup correctly.  Check that your AWS Account ID, Default Region and ARN match what you expect. You can safely ignore the rows beginning with `OCM` for now.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa whoami
