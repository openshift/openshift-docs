= Installing ROSA

Complete the following steps to install ROSA before creating a cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Review and complete the AWS prerequisites and ROSA policies.
* Create a link:https://cloud.redhat.com[Red Hat account], if you do not already have one. Then, check your email for a verification link. You will need these credentials to install ROSA.
* Configure your AWS account and enable the ROSA service in your AWS account.

.Procedure

.. Download the link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-service-aws/[latest release] of the `rosa` CLI for your operating system.
.. Optional: Rename the executable file you downloaded to `rosa`. This documentation uses `rosa` to refer to the executable file.
.. Optional: Add `rosa` to your path.

[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa completion > /etc/bash_completion.d/rosa
----
+
Add this file to the correct location for your operating system. For example, on a Linux machine, run the following command to enable `rosa` bash completion:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ source /etc/bash_completion.d/rosa
----

. Enter the following command to verify that your AWS account has the necessary permissions.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa verify permissions
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
I: Validating SCP policies...
I: AWS SCP policies ok
----

. Log in to your Red Hat account with `rosa`.
+
.. Enter the following command.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa login
----
+
.. Replace `<my_offline_access_token>` with your token.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]

.Example output continued
[source,terminal]

I: Logged in as 'rh-rosa-user' on 'https://api.openshift.com'
----

. Verify that your AWS account has the necessary quota to deploy an {product-title} cluster.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa verify quota --region=us-west-2
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
I: Validating AWS quota...
I: AWS quota ok
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Sometimes your AWS quota varies by region. If you receive any errors, try a different region.
====
+
If you need to increase your quota, go to your link:https://aws.amazon.com/console/[AWS console], and request a quota increase for the service that failed.
+
After both the permissions and quota checks pass, proceed to the next step.
+
. Prepare your AWS account for cluster deployment:
+
.. Run the following command to verify your Red Hat and AWS credentials are setup correctly.  Check that your AWS Account ID, Default Region and ARN match what you expect. You can safely ignore the rows beginning with OCM for now (OCM stands for OpenShift Cluster Manager).
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa whoami
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
AWS Account ID:               000000000000
AWS Default Region:           us-east-2
AWS ARN:                      arn:aws:iam::000000000000:user/hello
OCM API:                      https://api.openshift.com
OCM Account ID:               1DzGIdIhqEWyt8UUXQhSoWaaaaa
OCM Account Name:             Your Name
OCM Account Username:         you@domain.com

.. Initialize your AWS account. This step runs a CloudFormation template that prepares your AWS account for cluster deployment and management. This step typically takes 1-2 minutes to complete.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa init
