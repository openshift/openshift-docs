= Installing and configuring the ROSA CLI

Install and configure the {product-title} (ROSA) CLI, `rosa`. You can also install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) and verify if the required AWS resource quotas are available by using the ROSA CLI (`rosa`).

.Prerequisites

* Review and complete the AWS prerequisites and ROSA policies.
* Create a link:https://cloud.redhat.com[Red{nbsp}Hat account], if you do not already have one. Then, check your email for a verification link. You will need these credentials to install ROSA.
* Configure your AWS account and enable the ROSA service in your AWS account.

.Procedure

. Install `rosa`, the {product-title} command-line interface (CLI).
.. Download the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads[latest release] of the ROSA CLI for your operating system.
.. Optional: Rename the executable file you downloaded to `rosa`. This documentation uses `rosa` to refer to the executable file.
.. Optional: Add `rosa` to your path.

$ mv rosa /usr/local/bin/rosa
----
.. Enter the following command to verify your installation:

.. Optional: Generate the command completion scripts for the ROSA CLI. The following example generates the Bash completion scripts for a Linux machine:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/rosa
----
.. Optional: Enable command completion for the ROSA CLI from your existing terminal. The following example enables Bash completion for `rosa` in an existing terminal on a Linux machine:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ source /etc/bash_completion.d/rosa
----

. Log in to your Red{nbsp}Hat account with `rosa`.
+
.. Enter the following command.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa login
----
+
.. Replace `<my_offline_access_token>` with your token.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
To login to your Red Hat account, get an offline access token at https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token/rosa
? Copy the token and paste it here: <my-offline-access-token>
----
+
.Example output continued
[source,terminal]

I: Logged in as 'rh-rosa-user' on 'https://api.openshift.com'
----

. Enter the following command to verify that your AWS account has the necessary permissions.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa verify permissions
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
I: Validating SCP policies...
I: AWS SCP policies ok
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This command verifies permissions only for ROSA clusters that do not use the AWS Security Token Service (STS).
====

. Verify that your AWS account has the necessary quota to deploy an {product-title} cluster.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa verify quota --region=us-west-2
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
I: Validating AWS quota...
I: AWS quota ok
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Sometimes your AWS quota varies by region. If you receive any errors, try a different region.
====
+
If you need to increase your quota, go to your link:https://aws.amazon.com/console/[AWS console], and request a quota increase for the service that failed.
+
After both the permissions and quota checks pass, proceed to the next step.
+
. Prepare your AWS account for cluster deployment:
+
.. Run the following command to verify your Red{nbsp}Hat and AWS credentials are setup correctly. Check that your AWS Account ID, Default Region and ARN match what you expect. You can safely ignore the rows beginning with `OCM` for now.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa whoami

.Example output
[source,terminal]
