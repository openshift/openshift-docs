= Adding a replication repository to the CAM web console

You can add an replication repository to the CAM web console.

.Prerequisites

* The replication repository must support the S3 API.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can deploy a local S3 object storage with the link:https://github.com/fusor/mig-operator/blob/release-1.0/docs/usage/ObjectStorage.md[upstream NooBaa project or AWS S3].
====

* The replication repository must be accessible to the source and target clusters.

.Procedure

. Log in to the CAM web console on the {product-title} 4 cluster.
. In the *Replication repositories* section, click *Add replication repository*.

. Fill in the following fields:

* *Replication repository name*
* *S3 bucket name*
* *S3 bucket region*: Required for AWS S3 if the bucket region is not *us-east-1*. Optional for a generic S3 repository.
* *S3 endpoint*: Required for a generic S3 repository. This is the URL of the S3 service, not the bucket, for example, `\http://s3-noobaa.apps.cluster.com`.
