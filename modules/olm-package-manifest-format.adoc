= Package Manifest Format

The _Package Manifest Format_ for Operators is the legacy packaging format
introduced by the Operator Framework. While this format is deprecated in
{product-title} 4.5, it is still supported and Operators provided by Red Hat are
currently shipped using this method.

In this format, a version of an Operator is represented by a single
ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) and typically the CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs)
that define the owned APIs of the CSV, though additional objects may be
included. All versions of the Operator are nested in a single directory:

.Example Package Manifest Format layout
[source,terminal]
----
etcd
├── 0.6.1
│   ├── etcdcluster.crd.yaml
│   └── etcdoperator.clusterserviceversion.yaml
├── 0.9.0
│   ├── etcdbackup.crd.yaml
│   ├── etcdcluster.crd.yaml
│   ├── etcdoperator.v0.9.0.clusterserviceversion.yaml
│   └── etcdrestore.crd.yaml
├── 0.9.2
│   ├── etcdbackup.crd.yaml
│   ├── etcdcluster.crd.yaml
│   ├── etcdoperator.v0.9.2.clusterserviceversion.yaml
│   └── etcdrestore.crd.yaml
└── etcd.package.yaml
----

It also includes a `<name>.package.yaml` file that is the _package manifest_
that defines the package name and channels details:

.Example package manifest
[source,yaml]
----
packageName: etcd
channels:
- name: alpha
  currentCSV: etcdoperator.v0.9.2
- name: beta
  currentCSV: etcdoperator.v0.9.0
- name: stable
  currentCSV: etcdoperator.v0.9.2
defaultChannel: alpha
----

When loading package manifests into the Operator Registry database, the following
requirements are validated:

* Every package has at least one channel.
* Every CSV pointed to by a channel in a package exists.
* Every version of an Operator has exactly one CSV.
* If a CSV owns a CRD, that CRD must exist in the Operator version's directory.
* If a CSV replaces another, both the old and the new must exist in the package.
