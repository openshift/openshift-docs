= Fixed issues

////
Provide the following info for each issue if possible:
**Consequence** - What user action or situation would make this problem appear  (If you have the foo option enabled and did x)? What did the customer experience as a result of the issue? What was the symptom?
**Cause** - Why did this happen?
**Fix** - What did we change to fix the problem?
**Result** - How has the behavior changed as a result?  Try to avoid “It is fixed” or “The issue is resolved” or “The error no longer presents”.
