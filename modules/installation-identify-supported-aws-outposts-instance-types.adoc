= Identifying your AWS Outposts instance types

AWS Outposts rack catalog includes options supporting the latest generation Intel powered EC2 instance types with or without local instance storage.
Identify which instance types are configured in your AWS Outpost instance. As part of the installation process, you must update the `install-config.yaml` file with the instance type that the installation program will use to deploy worker nodes.

.Procedure

Use the AWS CLI to get the list of supported instance types by running the following command:
[source,terminal]
----
$ aws outposts get-outpost-instance-types --outpost-id <outpost_id> <1>
----
<1> For `<outpost_id>`, specify the Outpost ID, used in the AWS account for the worker instances

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
When you purchase capacity for your AWS Outpost instance, you specify an EC2 capacity layout that each server provides. Each server supports a single family of instance types. A layout can offer a single instance type or multiple instance types. Dedicated Hosts allows you to alter whatever you chose for that initial layout. If you allocate a host to support a single instance type for the entire capacity, you can only start a single instance type from that host.

Supported instance types in AWS Outposts might be changed. For more information, you can check the link:https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/rack/features/#Compute_and_storage[Compute and Storage] page in AWS Outposts documents.
