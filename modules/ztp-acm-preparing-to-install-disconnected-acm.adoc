= Preparing the disconnected environment

Before you can provision distributed units (DU) at scale, you must install {rh-rhacm-first}, which handles the provisioning of the DUs.

{rh-rhacm} is deployed as an Operator on the {product-title} hub cluster. It controls clusters and applications from a single console with built-in security policies. {rh-rhacm} provisions and manage your DU hosts. To install {rh-rhacm} in a disconnected environment, you create a mirror registry that mirrors the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) catalog that contains the required Operator images. OLM manages, installs, and upgrades Operators and their dependencies in the cluster.

You also use a disconnected mirror host to serve the {op-system} ISO and RootFS disk images that provision the DU bare-metal host operating system.

Before you install a cluster on infrastructure that you provision in a restricted network, you must mirror the required container images into that environment. You can also use this procedure in unrestricted networks to ensure your clusters only use container images that have satisfied your organizational controls on external content.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must have access to the internet to obtain the necessary container images.
In this procedure, you place the mirror registry on a mirror host
that has access to both your network and the internet. If you do not have access
to a mirror host, use the disconnected procedure to copy images to a device that you
can move across network boundaries.
