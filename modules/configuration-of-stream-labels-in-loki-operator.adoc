[id="configuration-of-stream-labels-in-loki-operator_{context}"]
= Configuration of stream labels in {loki-op}

Configuring which labels the {loki-op} will use as stream labels depends on the data model you are using: ViaQ or OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). 

Both models come with a predefined set of stream labels, for more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_logging/latest/html/configuring_logging/opentelemetry-data-model[OpenTelemetry data model].

ViaQ model::
ViaQ does not support structured metadata.
To configure stream labels for the ViaQ model, add the configuration in the `ClusterLogForwarder` resource. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: observability.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterLogForwarder
metadata:
  name: instance
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  serviceAccount:
    name: logging-collector
  outputs:
  - name: lokistack-out
    type: lokiStack
    lokiStack:
      target:
        name: logging-loki 
        namespace: openshift-logging
      labelKeys:
         LokiStackTenantLabelKeys:
---- 
+
`LokiStackLabelKeys` field contains the configuration that maps log record's keys to Loki labels used to identify streams.
+
`LokiStackTenantLabelKeys` field contains options for customizing the mapping of log record keys to Loki stream labels for a single tenant.

OTLP model::
In the OTLP model all labels that are not specified as stream labels are attached as structured metadata.

The following are the best practices for creating stream labels:

* They have a low cardinality. At most tens of values.
* The values are long lived. For example, the first level of an HTTP path: `/load`, `/save`, and `/update`.
* The labels can be used in queries to improve query performance.
