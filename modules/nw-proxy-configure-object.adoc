= Enabling the cluster-wide proxy

The Proxy object is used to manage the cluster-wide egress proxy. When a cluster is
installed or upgraded without the proxy configured, a Proxy object is still
generated but it will have a nil `spec`. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Proxy
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  trustedCA:
    name: ""
status:
----

A cluster administrator can configure the proxy for {product-title} by modifying
this `cluster` Proxy object.

[NOTE]
====
Only the Proxy object named `cluster` is supported, and no additional
proxies can be created.
====

.Prerequisites

* Cluster administrator permissions
* {product-title} `oc` CLI tool installed

.Procedure

. Create a ConfigMap that contains any additional CA certificates required for
proxying HTTPS connections.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can skip this step if the proxy's identity certificate is signed by an
authority from the RHCOS trust bundle.
====

.. Create a file called `user-ca-bundle.yaml` with the following contents, and provide the values of your PEM-encoded certificates:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  ca-bundle.crt: | <1>
    <MY_PEM_ENCODED_CERTS> <2>
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-ca-bundle <3>
  namespace: openshift-config <4>
----
<1> This data key must be named `ca-bundle.crt`.
<2> One or more PEM-encoded X.509 certificates used to sign the proxy's
identity certificate.
<3> The ConfigMap name that will be referenced from the Proxy object.
<4> The ConfigMap must be in the `openshift-config` namespace.

.. Create the ConfigMap from this file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f user-ca-bundle.yaml
----

. Use the `oc edit` command to modify the Proxy object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit proxy/cluster
----

. Configure the necessary fields for the proxy:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Proxy
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> <1>
  httpsProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> <2>
  noProxy: example.com <3>
  readinessEndpoints:
  - http://www.google.com <4>
  - https://www.google.com
  trustedCA:
    name: user-ca-bundle <5>
----
+
--
<1> A proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The
URL scheme must be `http`.
<2> A proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster.
<3> A comma-separated list of destination domain names, domains, IP addresses or
other network CIDRs to exclude proxying.
+
Preface a domain with `.` to match subdomains only. For example, `.y.com` matches `x.y.com`, but not `y.com`. Use `*` to bypass proxy for all destinations.
If you scale up workers that are not included in the network defined by the `networking.machineNetwork[].cidr` field from the installation configuration, you must add them to this list to prevent connection issues.
+
This field is ignored if neither the `httpProxy` or `httpsProxy` fields are set.
<4> One or more URLs external to the cluster to use to perform a readiness check
before writing the `httpProxy` and `httpsProxy` values to status.
<5> A reference to the ConfigMap in the `openshift-config` namespace that
contains additional CA certificates required for proxying HTTPS connections.
Note that the ConfigMap must already exist before referencing it here. This
field is required unless the proxy's identity certificate is signed by an
authority from the RHCOS trust bundle.
