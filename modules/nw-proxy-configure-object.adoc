= Enabling the cluster-wide proxy

The `Proxy` object is used to manage the cluster-wide egress proxy. When a cluster is installed or upgraded without the proxy configured, a `Proxy` object is still generated but it will have a nil `spec`. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Proxy
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  trustedCA:
    name: ""
status:
----

A cluster administrator can configure the proxy for {product-title} by modifying this `cluster` `Proxy` object.

[NOTE]
====
Only the `Proxy` object named `cluster` is supported, and no additional proxies can be created.
====

.Prerequisites

* Cluster administrator permissions
* {product-title} `oc` CLI tool installed

.Procedure

. Create a config map that contains any additional CA certificates required for proxying HTTPS connections.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can skip this step if the proxy's identity certificate is signed by an authority from the RHCOS trust bundle.
====

.. Create a file called `user-ca-bundle.yaml` with the following contents, and provide the values of your PEM-encoded certificates:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  ca-bundle.crt: | <1>
    <MY_PEM_ENCODED_CERTS> <2>
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-ca-bundle <3>
  namespace: openshift-config <4>
----
<1> This data key must be named `ca-bundle.crt`.
<2> One or more PEM-encoded X.509 certificates used to sign the proxy's
identity certificate.
<3> The config map name that will be referenced from the `Proxy` object.
<4> The config map must be in the `openshift-config` namespace.

.. Create the config map from this file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f user-ca-bundle.yaml
----

. Use the `oc edit` command to modify the `Proxy` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit proxy/cluster
----

. Configure the necessary fields for the proxy:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Proxy
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> <1>
  httpsProxy: https://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> <2>
  noProxy: example.com <3>
  readinessEndpoints:
  - http://www.google.com <4>
  - https://www.google.com
  trustedCA:
    name: user-ca-bundle <5>
----
+
--
<1> A proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The URL scheme must be `http`.
<2> A proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster. The URL scheme must be either `http` or `https`. Specify a URL for the proxy that supports the URL scheme. For example, most proxies will report an error if they are configured to use `https` but they only support `http`. This failure message may not propagate to the logs and can appear to be a network connection failure instead. If using a proxy that listens for `https` connections from the cluster, you may need to configure the cluster to accept the CAs and certificates that the proxy uses.
<3> A comma-separated list of destination domain names, domains, IP addresses or other network CIDRs to exclude proxying.
+
Preface a domain with `.` to match subdomains only. For example, `.y.com` matches `x.y.com`, but not `y.com`. Use `*` to bypass proxy for all destinations.
If you scale up workers that are not included in the network defined by the `networking.machineNetwork[].cidr` field from the installation configuration, you must add them to this list to prevent connection issues.
+
This field is ignored if neither the `httpProxy` or `httpsProxy` fields are set.
<4> One or more URLs external to the cluster to use to perform a readiness check before writing the `httpProxy` and `httpsProxy` values to status.
<5> A reference to the config map in the `openshift-config` namespace that contains additional CA certificates required for proxying HTTPS connections. Note that the config map must already exist before referencing it here. This field is required unless the proxy's identity certificate is signed by an authority from the RHCOS trust bundle.
