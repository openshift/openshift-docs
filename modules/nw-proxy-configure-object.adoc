= Enabling the cluster-wide proxy

The `Proxy` object is used to manage the cluster-wide egress proxy. When a cluster is installed or upgraded without the proxy configured, a `Proxy` object is still generated but it has a nil `spec`. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Proxy
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  trustedCA:
    name: ""
status:
----

[NOTE]
====
Only the `Proxy` object named `cluster` is supported, and no additional proxies can be created.
====

A cluster administrator can configure the proxy for {product-title} by modifying the `cluster` `Proxy` object.

[WARNING]
====
After you enable the cluster-wide proxy capability for your cluster and you save the `Proxy` object file, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) reboots all nodes in your cluster so that each node can access connections that exist outside of the cluster. You do not need to manually reboot these nodes.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator permissions.
* You installed the {product-title} `oc` CLI tool.

.Procedure

. Create a config map that contains any additional CA certificates required for proxying HTTPS connections.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can skip this step if the identity certificate of the proxy is signed by an authority from the {op-system-first} trust bundle.
====
+
.. Create a file called `user-ca-bundle.yaml`, and provide the values of your PEM-encoded certificates:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  ca-bundle.crt: | <1>
    <MY_PEM_ENCODED_CERTS> <2>
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-ca-bundle <3>
  namespace: openshift-config <4>
----
<1> This data key must be named `ca-bundle.crt`.
<2> One or more PEM-encoded X.509 certificates used to sign the proxy's
identity certificate.
<3> The config map name that is referenced from the `Proxy` object.
<4> The config map must exist in the `openshift-config` namespace.
+
.. Create the config map from the `user-ca-bundle.yaml` file by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f user-ca-bundle.yaml
----

. Use the `oc edit` command to modify the `Proxy` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit proxy/cluster
----

. Configure the necessary fields for the proxy:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Proxy
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> <1>
  httpsProxy: https://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> <2>
  noProxy: example.com <3>
  readinessEndpoints:
  - http://www.google.com <4>
  - https://www.google.com
  trustedCA:
    name: user-ca-bundle <5>
----
+
--
<1> A proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The URL scheme must be `http`.
<2> A proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster. The URL scheme must be either `http` or `https`. Specify a URL for the proxy that supports the URL scheme. For example, most proxies report an error if they are configured to use `https` but they only support `http`. This failure message may not propagate to the logs and can appear to be a network connection failure instead. If using a proxy that listens for `https` connections from the cluster, you might need to configure the cluster to accept the CAs and certificates that the proxy uses.
<3> A comma-separated list of destination domain names, domains, IP addresses (or other network CIDRs), and port numbers to exclude proxying.
+
[NOTE]
====
Port numbers are only supported when configuring IPv6 addresses. Port numbers are not supported when configuring IPv4 addresses.
====
+
Preface a domain with `.` to match subdomains only. For example, `.y.com` matches `x.y.com`, but not `y.com`. Use `*` to bypass proxy for all destinations.
+
If your `noproxy` field needs to include a domain address, you must explicitly specify that FQDN, or prefix-matched subdomain, in the `noproxy` field. You cannot use the IP address or CIDR range that encapsulates the domain. This is because the cluster does not wait for DNS to return the IP address before assigning the route connection, and checks explicitly against the request being made.
For example, if you have a CIDR block value, such as `10.0.0.0/24`, for the `noproxy` field and the field attempts to access `\https://10.0.0.11`, the addresses successfully match. However, attempting to access `\https://exampleserver.externaldomain.com`, whose A record entry is `10.0.0.11`, fails. An additional value of `.externaldomain.com` for your `noproxy` field is necessary.
+
If you scale up compute nodes that are not included in the network defined by the `networking.machineNetwork[].cidr` field from the installation configuration, you must add them to this list to prevent connection issues.
+
This field is ignored if neither the `httpProxy` or `httpsProxy` fields are set.
<4> One or more URLs external to the cluster to use to perform a readiness check before writing the `httpProxy` and `httpsProxy` values to status.
<5> A reference to the config map in the `openshift-config` namespace that contains additional CA certificates required for proxying HTTPS connections. Note that the config map must already exist before referencing it here. This field is required unless the proxy's identity certificate is signed by an authority from the {op-system} trust bundle.
