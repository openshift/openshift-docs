= Filtering network traffic
By default, the Network Traffic page displays the traffic flow data in the cluster based on the default filters configured in the FlowCollector instance. You can use the filter options to observe the required data by changing the preset filter. Following are the available filter options:

.Query Options
Following are the available options:

** *Reporter Node*: Every flow can be reported from both source and destination nodes. For cluster ingress, the flow is reported from the destination node and for cluster egress, the flow is reported from the source node.You can select either *Source* or *Destination*. The option *Both* is disabled for Topology view. The default selected value is *Destination*.
** *Match filters*: To determine whether the result has to match all the filters or any of them. The available options are *Match all* and *Match any*. The default value is *Match all*.
** *Limit*: The limit for internal backend queries. Depending upon the matching and filter settings, several queries can be performed under the cover, each with this limit set, resulting in more results after aggregation.

.Quick filters
You can filter the traffic based on the categories that are defined in the `FlowCollector` config. 
// to check with SME what are the default quick filters available in flowcollector

//what name to give this filter
.Key-value filters
You can filter the traffic by selecting the parameters, and entering the corresponding text values. To filter the exact matching data, enter the values in double-quotes. The default value is *Common Namespaces*.

Note: "Common" means filters for any of source or destination. For example, filtering name: 'my-pod' means all traffic from my-pod + all traffic to my-pod, regardless of the matching type used (all of / any of).
//Do we have Common in flowcollector config too?
//Check with SME what is values being themselves a list, as a comma-separated string

The traffic flow for specific workloads can also be viewed by navigating to the Network Traffic tab of workloads.
