= Filtering network traffic
By default, the Network Traffic page displays the traffic flow data in the cluster based on the default filters configured in the FlowCollector instance. You can use the filter options to observe the required data by changing the preset filter. Following are the available filter options:


.Quick filters
The default values in *Quick filters* drop-down are defined in the `FlowCollector` config. You can modify the options from console. 

.Advanced filters
To set advanced filters:

* Select the parameters. The default selected parameter is *Common Namespaces*.
* Enter the value. To filter the data that matches the text value exactly, enter the value in double quotation marks. 

The section *Common* in the parameter drop-down filters results that match either *Source* or *Destination*. To enable or disable the applied filter, you can click on the applied filter listed below the filter options.

.Query Options
You can use *Query Options* to optimize the search results, as listed below:

** *Reporter Node*: Every flow can be reported from both source and destination nodes. For cluster ingress, the flow is reported from the destination node and for cluster egress, the flow is reported from the source node.You can select either *Source* or *Destination*. The option *Both* is disabled for overview and topology view. The default selected value is *Destination*.
** *Match filters*: You can determine the relation between different filter parameters selected in advanced filter. The available options are *Match all* and *Match any*. *Match all*  provides results that match all the values, and *Match any* provides results that match any of the values entered.The default value is *Match all*.
** *Limit*: The limit for internal backend queries. Depending upon the matching and filter settings, several queries can be performed under the cover, each with this limit set, resulting in more results after aggregation.

You can click *Reset default filter* to remove the existing filters, and apply the filter defined in `FlowCollector` config.
