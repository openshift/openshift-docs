= Configuring a managed cluster for a disconnected environment

After you have completed the preceding procedure, follow these steps to configure the managed cluster for a disconnected environment.

.Prerequisites

* A disconnected installation of {rh-rhacm-first} 2.3.

* Host the `rootfs` and `iso` images on an HTTPD server.

.Procedure

. Create a `ConfigMap` containing the mirror registry config:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: assisted-installer-mirror-config
  namespace: assisted-installer
  labels:
    app: assisted-service
data:
  ca-bundle.crt: <certificate> <1>
  registries.conf: |  <2>
    unqualified-search-registries = ["registry.access.redhat.com", "docker.io"]

    [[registry]]
      location = <mirror-registry-url>  <3>
      insecure = false
      mirror-by-digest-only = true
----
<1> `certificate` is the mirror registryâ€™s certificate used when creating the mirror registry.
<2> `registry-config` is the configuration for the mirror registry.
<3> `mirror-registry-url` is the URL of the mirror registry.
+
This updates `mirrorRegistryRef` in the `AgentServiceConfig` custom resource, as shown below:
+
.Example output
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: agent-install.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: AgentServiceConfig
metadata:
  name: agent
  namespace: assisted-installer
spec:
  databaseStorage:
    volumeName: <db-pv-name>
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: <db-storage-size>
  filesystemStorage:
    volumeName: <fs-pv-name>
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: <fs-storage-size>
  mirrorRegistryRef:
    name: 'assisted-installer-mirror-config'
  osImages:
    - openshiftVersion: <ocp-version>
      rootfs: <rootfs-url> <1>
      url: <iso-url> <1>
----
<1> `rootfs-url` and the `iso-url` must match the URLs of the HTTPD server.

. For disconnected installations, you must deploy an NTP clock that is reachable through the disconnected network.
You can do this by configuring chrony to act as server, editing the `/etc/chrony.conf` file, and adding the following allowed IPv6 range:
+
[source,text]
----
# Allow NTP client access from local network.
#allow 192.168.0.0/16
local stratum 10
bindcmdaddress ::
allow 2620:52:0:1310::/64
