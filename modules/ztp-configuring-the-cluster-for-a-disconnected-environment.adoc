= Configuring the hub cluster to use a disconnected mirror registry

You can configure the hub cluster to use a disconnected mirror registry for a disconnected environment.

.Prerequisites

* You have a disconnected hub cluster installation with {rh-rhacm-first} {rh-rhacm-version} installed.

* You have hosted the `rootfs` and `iso` images on an HTTP server.

[WARNING]
====
If you enable TLS for the HTTP server, you must confirm the root certificate is signed by an authority trusted by the client and verify the trusted certificate chain between your {product-title} hub and managed clusters and the HTTP server. Using a server configured with an untrusted certificate prevents the images from being downloaded to the image creation service. Using untrusted HTTPS servers is not supported.
====

.Procedure

. Create a `ConfigMap` containing the mirror registry config:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: assisted-installer-config-map
  namespace: "<infrastructure_operator_namespace>" <1>
  labels:
    app: assisted-service
data:
  ca-bundle.crt: | <2>
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <certificate_contents>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----

  registries.conf: | <3>
    unqualified-search-registries = ["registry.access.redhat.com", "docker.io"]

    [[registry]]
       prefix = ""
       location = "quay.io/example-repository" <4>
       mirror-by-digest-only = true

       [[registry.mirror]]
       location = "mirror1.registry.corp.com:5000/example-repository" <5>
----
<1> The `ConfigMap` namespace must be the same as the namespace of the Infrastructure Operator.
<2> The mirror registryâ€™s certificate that is used when creating the mirror registry.
<3> The configuration file for the mirror registry. The mirror registry configuration adds mirror information to the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` file in the discovery image. The mirror information is stored in the `imageContentSources` section of the `install-config.yaml` file when the information is passed to the installation program. The Assisted Service pod that runs on the hub cluster fetches the container images from the configured mirror registry.
<4> The URL of the mirror registry. You must use the URL from the `imageContentSources` section by running the `oc adm release mirror` command when you configure the mirror registry. For more information, see the _Mirroring the OpenShift Container Platform image repository_ section.
<5> The registries defined in the `registries.conf` file must be scoped by repository, not by registry. In this example, both the `quay.io/example-repository` and the `mirror1.registry.corp.com:5000/example-repository` repositories are scoped by the `example-repository` repository.
+
This updates `mirrorRegistryRef` in the `AgentServiceConfig` custom resource, as shown below:
+
.Example output
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: agent-install.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: AgentServiceConfig
metadata:
  name: agent
spec:
  databaseStorage:
    volumeName: <db_pv_name>
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: <db_storage_size>
  filesystemStorage:
    volumeName: <fs_pv_name>
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: <fs_storage_size>
  mirrorRegistryRef:
    name: 'assisted-installer-mirror-config'
  osImages:
    - openshiftVersion: <ocp_version>
      url: <iso_url> <1>
----
<1> Must match the URL of the HTTPD server.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A valid NTP server is required during cluster installation. Ensure that a suitable NTP server is available and can be reached from the installed clusters through the disconnected network.
