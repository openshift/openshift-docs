= Creating the NUMAResourcesOperator custom resource

When you have installed the NUMA Resources Operator, then create the `NUMAResourcesOperator` custom resource (CR) that instructs the NUMA Resources Operator to install all the cluster infrastructure needed to support the NUMA-aware scheduler, including daemon sets and APIs.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Install the NUMA Resources Operator.

.Procedure

. Create the `NUMAResourcesOperator` custom resource:

.. Save the following minimal required YAML file example as `nrop.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: nodetopology.openshift.io/v1
kind: NUMAResourcesOperator
metadata:
  name: numaresourcesoperator
spec:
  nodeGroups:
  - machineConfigPoolSelector:
      matchLabels:
        pools.operator.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/worker: "" <1>
----
+
<1> This should match the `MachineConfigPool` that you want to configure the NUMA Resources Operator on. For example, you might have created a `MachineConfigPool` named `worker-cnf` that designates a set of nodes expected to run telecommunications workloads.

.. Create the `NUMAResourcesOperator` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f nrop.yaml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Creating the `NUMAResourcesOperator` triggers a reboot on the corresponding machine config pool and therefore the affected node.
====

.Verification

. Verify that the NUMA Resources Operator deployed successfully by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get numaresourcesoperators.nodetopology.openshift.io
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                    AGE
numaresourcesoperator   27s
----

. After a few minutes, run the following command to verify that the required resources deployed successfully:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get all -n openshift-numaresources
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
