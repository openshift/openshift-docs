= Generating a seed image with the {lcao}

Use the {lcao} to generate the seed image with the `SeedGenerator` CR. The Operator checks for required system configurations, performs any necessary system cleanup before generating the seed image, and launches the image generation. The seed image generation includes the following tasks:

* Stopping cluster operators
* Preparing the seed image configuration
* Generating and pushing the seed image to the image repository specified in the `SeedGenerator` CR
* Restoring cluster operators
* Expiring seed cluster certificates
* Generating new certificates for the seed cluster
* Restoring and updates the `SeedGenerator` CR on the seed cluster

[NOTE]
====
The generated seed image does not include any site-specific data.

To avoid including any {rh-rhacm-first} resources in your seed image, you need to disable all optional {rh-rhacm} add-ons for seed image generation.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have deployed a managed {sno} cluster with a DU profile.
* Install the {lcao} in the hub cluster.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Review the required versions of software components in the section _Software prerequisites for an image-based installation_.
* If you use {rh-rhacm-first}, review the hub cluster guidelines in the section _Hub cluster guidelines_.
* You created an extra partition in the seed cluster. See _Configuring a shared container directory between `ostree` stateroots_ for further information.

.Procedure

. Detach the cluster to delete any cluster-specific resources from the seed cluster that must not be in the seed image:

.. Manually detach the seed cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete managedcluster sno-worker-example
----

... Wait until the `ManagedCluster` CR is removed. Once the CR is removed, create the proper `SeedGenerator` CR. The {lcao} cleans up the {rh-rhacm} artifacts.

. Create the `Secret`.

.. Create the authentication file by running the following command:
+
--
.Authentication file
[source,terminal]
----
$ MY_USER=myuserid
$ AUTHFILE=/tmp/my-auth.json
$ podman login --authfile ${AUTHFILE} -u ${MY_USER} quay.io/${MY_USER}
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ base64 -w 0 ${AUTHFILE} ; echo
----
--

.. Copy the output into the `seedAuth` field in a `Secret` CR named `seedgen` in the `openshift-lifecycle-agent` namespace.
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: seedgen <1>
  namespace: openshift-lifecycle-agent
type: Opaque
data:
  seedAuth: <encoded_AUTHFILE> <2>
----
<1> The `Secret` resource must have the `name: seedgen` and `namespace: openshift-lifecycle-agent` fields.
<2> Specifies a base64-encoded authfile for write-access to the registry for pushing the generated seed images.
--

.. Apply the `Secret`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f secretseedgenerator.yaml
----

. Create the `SeedGenerator` CR:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: lca.openshift.io/v1
kind: SeedGenerator
metadata:
  name: seedimage <1>
spec:
  seedImage: <seed_container_image> <2>
----
<1> The `SeedGenerator` CR must be named `seedimage`.
<2> Specify the container image URL, for example, `quay.io/example/seed-container-image:<tag>`. It is recommended to use the `<seed_cluster_name>:<ocp_version>` format.
--

. Generate the seed image by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f seedgenerator.yaml
----

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
During the seed generation process, the cluster temporarily loses API capabilities because {lcao} stops {product-title} and shuts down all running Operators and pods. When the process completes, {lcao} restarts {product-title}, which triggers the recovery of the Operators. 
====

If you want to generate further seed images, you must provision a new seed cluster with the version you want to generate a seed image from.

.Verification

. Once the cluster recovers and it is available, you can check the status of the `SeedGenerator` CR:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get seedgenerator -oyaml
----

.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2024-02-13T21:24:26Z"
    message: Seed Generation completed
    observedGeneration: 1
    reason: Completed
    status: "False"
    type: SeedGenInProgress
  - lastTransitionTime: "2024-02-13T21:24:26Z"
    message: Seed Generation completed
    observedGeneration: 1
    reason: Completed
    status: "True"
    type: SeedGenCompleted <1>
  observedGeneration: 1
----
<1> The seed image generation is complete.
--

. Verify that the {sno} cluster is running and is attached to the {rh-rhacm} hub cluster:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get managedclusters sno-worker-example
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                 HUB ACCEPTED   MANAGED CLUSTER URLS                                  JOINED   AVAILABLE   AGE
sno-worker-example   true           https://api.sno-worker-example.example.redhat.com     True     True        21h <1>
----
<1> The cluster is attached if you see that the value is `True` for both `JOINED` and `AVAILABLE`.

[NOTE]
====
The cluster requires time to recover after restarting the `kubelet` operation.
