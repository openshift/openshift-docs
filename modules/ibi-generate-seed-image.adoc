= Generating a seed image with the {lcao}

Use the {lcao} to generate the seed image with the `SeedGenerator` CR. The Operator checks for required system configurations, performs any necessary system cleanup before generating the seed image, and launches the image generation. The seed image generation includes the following tasks:

* Stopping cluster operators
* Preparing the seed image configuration
* Generating and pushing the seed image to the image repository specified in the `SeedGenerator` CR
* Restoring cluster operators
* Expiring seed cluster certificates
* Generating new certificates for the seed cluster
* Restoring and updates the `SeedGenerator` CR on the seed cluster

[NOTE]
====
The generated seed image does not include any site-specific data.

To avoid including any {rh-rhacm-first} resources in your seed image, you need to disable all optional {rh-rhacm} add-ons for seed image generation.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have deployed a managed {sno} cluster with a DU profile.
* Install the {lcao} in the {sno} cluster.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Review the required versions of software components in the section _Software prerequisites for an image-based installation_.
* If you use {rh-rhacm-first}, review the hub cluster guidelines in the section _Hub cluster guidelines_.
* You created an extra partition in the seed cluster. See _Configuring a shared container directory between `ostree` stateroots_ for further information.

.Procedure

. If the cluster is a managed cluster, detach the cluster from the hub to delete any cluster-specific resources from the seed cluster that must not be in the seed image:

.. Manually detach the seed cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete managedcluster sno-worker-example
----

... Wait until the `ManagedCluster` CR is removed. After the CR is removed, create the proper `SeedGenerator` CR. The {lcao} cleans up the {rh-rhacm} artifacts.

. Create the `Secret` object so that you can push the seed image to your registry.

.. Create the authentication file by running the following command:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
$ MY_USER=myuserid
$ AUTHFILE=/tmp/my-auth.json
$ podman login --authfile ${AUTHFILE} -u ${MY_USER} quay.io/${MY_USER}
----

[source,terminal]
----
$ base64 -w 0 ${AUTHFILE} ; echo
----
--

.. Copy the output into the `seedAuth` field in the `Secret` YAML file named `seedgen` in the `openshift-lifecycle-agent` namespace:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: seedgen <1>
  namespace: openshift-lifecycle-agent
type: Opaque
data:
  seedAuth: <encoded_AUTHFILE> <2>
----
<1> The `Secret` resource must have the `name: seedgen` and `namespace: openshift-lifecycle-agent` fields.
<2> Specifies a base64-encoded authfile for write-access to the registry for pushing the generated seed images.
--

.. Apply the `Secret` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f secretseedgenerator.yaml
----

. Create the `SeedGenerator` CR:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: lca.openshift.io/v1
kind: SeedGenerator
metadata:
  name: seedimage <1>
spec:
  seedImage: <seed_container_image> <2>
----
<1> The `SeedGenerator` CR must be named `seedimage`.
<2> Specify the container image URL, for example, `quay.io/example/seed-container-image:<tag>`. It is recommended to use the `<seed_cluster_name>:<ocp_version>` format.
--

. Generate the seed image by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f seedgenerator.yaml
----

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
During the seed generation process, the cluster temporarily loses API capabilities because {lcao} stops {product-title} and shuts down all running Operators and pods. When the process completes, {lcao} restarts {product-title}, which triggers the recovery of the Operators. 
====

If you want to generate further seed images, you must provision a new seed cluster with the version you want to generate a seed image from.

.Verification

. After the cluster recovers and it is available, you can check the status of the `SeedGenerator` CR:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get seedgenerator -oyaml
----

.Example output
[source,yaml]
