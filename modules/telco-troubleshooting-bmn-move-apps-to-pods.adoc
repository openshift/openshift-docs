= Moving applications to pods within the cluster

For scheduled hardware maintenance, you need to consider how to move your application pods to other nodes within the cluster without affecting the pod workload.

.Procedure

* Mark the node as unschedulable by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm cordon <node_name>
----

When the node is unschedulable, no pods can be scheduled on the node. 
For more information, see "Working with nodes".

[NOTE]
====
When moving CNF applications, you might need to verify ahead of time that there are enough additional worker nodes in the cluster due to anti-affinity and pod disruption budget.
