= Network Observability Operator 1.5.0 known issues

[role="_abstract"]
You can view the following known issues for the Network Observability Operator 1.5 release.

* When trying to access the web console, cache issues on OCP 4.14.10 prevent access to the *Observe* view. The web console shows the error message: `Failed to get a valid plugin manifest from /api/plugins/monitoring-plugin/`. The recommended workaround is to update the cluster to the latest minor version. If this does not work, you need to apply the workarounds described in this link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7052408[Red Hat Knowledgebase article].(link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1493[*NETOBSERV-1493*])

* Since the 1.3.0 release of the Network Observability Operator, installing the Operator causes a warning kernel taint to appear. The reason for this error is that the network observability eBPF agent has memory constraints that prevent preallocating the entire hashmap table. The Operator eBPF agent sets the `BPF_F_NO_PREALLOC` flag so that pre-allocation is disabled when the hashmap is too memory expansive.
