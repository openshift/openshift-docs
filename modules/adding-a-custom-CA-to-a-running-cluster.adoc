[id="adding-a-custom-CA-to-a-running-cluster_{context}"]
= Adding a custom CA to a running cluster

[role="_abstract"]
To add a custom CA certificate to your running {product-title} cluster, you can create a `ConfigMap` object with your certificate and reference it in the cluster `Proxy` object.

[NOTE]
====
When you modify the cluster `Proxy` object, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) initiates a rolling reboot of all nodes to apply the change. This is expected behavior and does not require manual intervention.
====

This procedure uses the `trustedCA` field in the `Proxy` object. If you also need to configure or modify egress proxy settings at the same time, see the "Configuring the cluster-wide proxy" chapter for detailed instructions.

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster-admin privileges.

* You have the {oc-first} installed.

* You have your custom CA certificate available in PEM-encoded format.

.Procedure

. Create a `ConfigMap` object with your CA certificate.

.. Create a YAML file named `custom-ca.yaml` to define the `ConfigMap` object.

.. Add the following content to the file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: custom-ca-bundle
  namespace: openshift-config
data:
  ca-bundle.crt: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <MY_PEM_ENCODED_CA_CERT>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----
+
where:
+
--
`metadata.name`:: Specifies the name of the `ConfigMap` object that you will reference from the `Proxy` object.
`metadata.namespace`:: Specifies the namespace of the `ConfigMap` object.
`data.ca-bundle.crt`:: Specifies the data key for the certificate bundle.
--

. Apply the manifest to create the `ConfigMap` object in the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f custom-ca.yaml
----

. Reference the `ConfigMap` object in the cluster `Proxy` object.

.. Update the cluster `Proxy` object to reference the `ConfigMap` object you just created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch proxy/cluster --type=merge --patch='{"spec":{"trustedCA":{"name":"custom-ca-bundle"}}}'
----
+
After you run this command, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) detects the change and begins distributing the new trusted CA to all nodes in the cluster.
