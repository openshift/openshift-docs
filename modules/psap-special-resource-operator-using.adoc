= Using the Special Resource Operator

The Special Resource Operator (SRO) is used to manage the build and deployment of a driver container. The objects required to build and deploy the container can be defined in a Helm chart. 

The examples in this section use the simple-kmod kernel module to demonstrate how to use the SRO to build and run a driver container.
In the first example, the SRO image contains a local repository of Helm charts including the templates for deploying the simple-kmod kernel module. In this case, a `SpecialResource` manifest is used to deploy the driver container. In the second example, the simple-kmod `SpecialResource` object points to a `ConfigMap` object that is created to store the Helm charts.
