= Overriding Operator conditions

As a cluster administrator, you might want to ignore a supported Operator condition reported by an Operator. When present, Operator conditions in the `Spec.Overrides` array override the conditions in the `Spec.Conditions` array, allowing cluster administrators to deal with situations where an Operator is incorrectly reporting a state to Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

For example, consider a known version of an Operator that always communicates that it is not upgradeable. In this instance, you might want to upgrade the Operator despite the Operator communicating that it is not upgradeable. This could be accomplished by overriding the Operator condition by adding the condition `type` and `status` to the `Spec.Overrides` array in the `OperatorCondition` resource.

.Prerequisites

* An Operator with an `OperatorCondition` resource, installed using OLM.

.Procedure

. Edit the `OperatorCondition` resource for the Operator:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit operatorcondition <name>
----

. Add a `Spec.Overrides` array to the object:
+
