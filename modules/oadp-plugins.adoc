[role="_abstract"]
The {oadp-first} provides default Velero plugins that are integrated with storage providers to support backup and snapshot operations. You can create link:https://{velero-domain}/docs/v{velero-version}/custom-plugins/[custom plugins] based on the Velero plugins.

OADP also provides plugins for {product-title} resource backups, OpenShift Virtualization resource backups, and Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots.

1. Mandatory.
2. Virtual machine disks are backed up with CSI snapshots or Restic.
3. The `csi` plugin uses the Kubernetes CSI snapshot API.
* OADP 1.1 or later uses `snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1`
* OADP 1.0 uses `snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1beta1`
4. Do not add the `hypershift` plugin in the `DataProtectionApplication` custom resource if the cluster is not a HyperShift hosted cluster.
