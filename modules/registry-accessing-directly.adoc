= Accessing the registry directly from the cluster

[role="_abstract"]
You can access the registry from inside the cluster by using internal routes.

.Procedure

. Access the node by getting its name:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug nodes/<node_name>
----

. To enable access to tools such as `oc` and `podman` on the node, change your root directory to `/host`. Successful output on running the commands states `Login Succeeded!`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# chroot /host
----

. Log in to the container image registry by using your access token:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# oc login -u kubeadmin -p <password_from_install_log> https://api-int.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>:6443
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# podman login -u kubeadmin -p $(oc whoami -t) image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You can pass almost any value for the user name. The token contains all necessary information. Passing a user name that contains colons results in a login failure.

The Image Registry Operator creates the route, such as `default-route-openshift-image-registry.<cluster_name>`.
====

. Perform `podman pull` and `podman push` operations against your registry. The following example commands demonstrate these operations.
+
.. Pull an arbitrary image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# podman pull <name.io>/<image>
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You can pull arbitrary images, but if you have the *system:registry* role added, you can only push images to the registry in your project.
====
+
.. Tag the new image with the form `<registry_ip>:<port>/<project>/<image>`. For example, `172.30.124.220:5000/openshift/image`. The project name must show in the pull specification for {product-title} to correctly place and later access the image in the registry.
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# podman tag <name.io>/<image> image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openshift/<image>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You must have the `system:image-builder` role for the specified project, which allows the user to write or push an image. Otherwise, the `podman push` in the next step will fail. To test, you can create a new project to push the image.
====
+
.. Push the newly tagged image to your registry:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.2# podman push image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openshift/<image>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
When pushing images to the internal registry, the repository name must use the `<project>/<name>` format. Using multiple project levels in the repository name results in an authentication error.
