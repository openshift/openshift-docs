= Creating the image set configuration

Before you can use the oc-mirror plugin to mirror image sets, you must create an image set configuration file. This image set configuration file defines which {product-title} releases, Operators, and other images to mirror, along with other configuration settings for the oc-mirror plugin.

You must specify a storage backend in the image set configuration file. This storage backend can be a local directory or a registry that supports link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2[Docker v2-2]. The oc-mirror plugin stores metadata in this storage backend during image set creation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not delete or modify the metadata that is generated by the oc-mirror plugin. You must use the same storage backend every time you run the oc-mirror plugin for the same mirror registry.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have created a container image registry credentials file. For instructions, see _Configuring credentials that allow images to be mirrored_.

.Procedure

. Use the `oc mirror init` command to create a template for the image set configuration and save it to a file called `imageset-config.yaml`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc mirror init --registry example.com/mirror/oc-mirror-metadata > imageset-config.yaml <1>
----
<1> Replace `example.com/mirror/oc-mirror-metadata` with the location of your registry for the storage backend.

. Edit the file and adjust the settings as necessary:

----
<1> Add `archiveSize` to set the maximum size, in GiB, of each file within the image set.
<2> Set the back-end location to save the image set metadata to. This location can be a registry or local directory. It is required to specify `storageConfig` values.
<3> Set the registry URL for the storage backend.
<4> Set the channel to retrieve the {product-title} images from.
<5> Add `graph: true` to build and push the graph-data image to the mirror registry. The graph-data image is required to create OpenShift Update Service (OSUS). The `graph: true` field also generates the `UpdateService` custom resource manifest. The `oc` command-line interface (CLI) can use the `UpdateService` custom resource manifest to create OSUS. For more information, see _About the OpenShift Update Service_.
<6> Set the Operator catalog to retrieve the {product-title} images from.
<7> Specify only certain Operator packages to include in the image set. Remove this field to retrieve all packages in the catalog.
<8> Specify only certain channels of the Operator packages to include in the image set. You must always include the default channel for the Operator package even if you do not use the bundles in that channel. You can find the default channel by running the following command: `oc mirror list operators --catalog=<catalog_name> --package=<package_name>`.
<9> Specify any additional images to include in image set.
+
See _Image set configuration parameters_ for the full list of parameters and _Image set configuration examples_ for various mirroring use cases.

. Save the updated file.
+
This image set configuration file is required by the `oc mirror` command when mirroring content.
