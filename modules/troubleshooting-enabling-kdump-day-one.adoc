= Enabling kdump on day-1

The `kdump` service is intended to be enabled per node to debug kernel problems. Because there are costs to having kdump enabled, and these costs accumulate with each additional kdump-enabled node, it is recommended that the `kdump` service only be enabled on each node as needed. Potential costs of enabling the `kdump` service on each node include:

* Less available RAM due to memory being reserved for the crash kernel.
* Node unavailability while the kernel is dumping the core.
* Additional storage space being used to store the crash dumps.

If you are aware of the downsides and trade-offs of having the `kdump` service enabled, it is possible to enable kdump in a cluster-wide fashion. Although machine-specific machine configs are not yet supported, you can use a `systemd` unit in a `MachineConfig` object as a day-1 customization and have kdump enabled on all nodes in the cluster. You can create a `MachineConfig` object and inject that object into the set of manifest files used by Ignition during cluster setup.

[NOTE]
====
See "Customizing nodes" in the _Installing -> Installation configuration_ section for more information and examples on how to use Ignition configs.

.Procedure

Create a `MachineConfig` object for cluster-wide configuration:

. Create a Butane config file, `99-worker-kdump.bu`, that configures and enables kdump:

<1> Replace `worker` with `master` in both locations when creating a `MachineConfig` object for control plane nodes.
<2> Provide kernel arguments to reserve memory for the crash kernel. You can add other kernel arguments if necessary. For the `ppc64le` platform, the recommended value for `crashkernel` is `crashkernel=2G-4G:384M,4G-16G:512M,16G-64G:1G,64G-128G:2G,128G-:4G`.
<3> If you want to change the contents of `/etc/kdump.conf` from the default, include this section and modify the `inline` subsection accordingly.
<4> If you want to change the contents of `/etc/sysconfig/kdump` from the default, include this section and modify the `inline` subsection accordingly.
<5> For the `ppc64le` platform, replace `nr_cpus=1` with `maxcpus=1`, which is not supported on this platform.

[NOTE]
====
To export the dumps to NFS targets, some kernel modules must be explicitly added to the configuration file:

.Example `/etc/kdump.conf` file

. Use Butane to generate a machine config YAML file, `99-worker-kdump.yaml`, containing the configuration to be delivered to the nodes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ butane 99-worker-kdump.bu -o 99-worker-kdump.yaml
----

. Put the YAML file into the `<installation_directory>/manifests/` directory during cluster setup. You can also create this `MachineConfig` object after cluster setup with the YAML file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f 99-worker-kdump.yaml
