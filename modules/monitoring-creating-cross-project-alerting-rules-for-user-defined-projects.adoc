= Creating cross-project alerting rules for user-defined projects

[role="_abstract"]
You can create alerting rules that are not bound to their project of origin by configuring a project in the `user-workload-monitoring-config` config map. The `PrometheusRule` objects created in these projects are then applicable to all projects.

Therefore, you can have generic alerting rules that apply to multiple user-defined projects instead of having individual `PrometheusRule` objects in each user project. You can filter which projects are included or excluded from the alerting rule by using PromQL queries in the `PrometheusRule` object.

.Prerequisites

ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* If you are a cluster administrator, you have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
* If you are a non-administrator user, you have access to the cluster as a user with the following user roles:
** The `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project to edit the `user-workload-monitoring-config` config map.
** The `monitoring-rules-edit` cluster role for the project where you want to create an alerting rule.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are a non-administrator user, you can still create cross-project alerting rules if you have the `monitoring-rules-edit` cluster role for the project where you want to create an alerting rule. However, that project needs to be configured in the `user-workload-monitoring-config` config map under the `namespacesWithoutLabelEnforcement` property, which can be done only by cluster administrators.
====
* The `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object exists. This object is created by default when the cluster is created.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Edit the `user-workload-monitoring-config` config map in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
----

. Configure projects in which you want to create alerting rules that are not bound to a specific project:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    namespacesWithoutLabelEnforcement: [ <namespace1>, <namespace2> ]
    # ...
----
+
where:

`namespacesWithoutLabelEnforcement`::
Specifies one or more projects in which you want to create cross-project alerting rules. Prometheus and Thanos Ruler for user-defined monitoring do not enforce the `namespace` label in `PrometheusRule` objects created in these projects, making the `PrometheusRule` objects applicable to all projects.

. Create a YAML file for alerting rules. In this example, it is called `example-cross-project-alerting-rule.yaml`.

. Add an alerting rule configuration to the YAML file.
The following example creates a new cross-project alerting rule called `example-security`. The alerting rule fires when a user project does not enforce the restricted pod security policy:
+
.Example cross-project alerting rule
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: example-security
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  groups:
    - name: pod-security-policy
      rules:
        - alert: "ProjectNotEnforcingRestrictedPolicy"
          for: 5m
          expr: kube_namespace_labels{namespace!~"(openshift|kube).*|default",label_pod_security_kubernetes_io_enforce!="restricted"}
          annotations:
            message: "Restricted policy not enforced. Project {{ $labels.namespace }} does not enforce the restricted pod security policy."
          labels:
            severity: warning
----
+
--
where:

`namespace`::
Specifies the project. Ensure that you specify the project that you defined in the `namespacesWithoutLabelEnforcement` field.

`alert`::
Specifies the name of the alerting rule you want to create.

`for`::
Specifies the duration for which the condition should be true before an alert is fired.

`expr`::
Specifies the PromQL query expression that defines the new rule. You can use label matchers on the `namespace` label to filter which projects are included or excluded from the alerting rule.

`annotations.message`::
Specifies the message associated with the alert.

`labels.severity`::
Specifies the severity that alerting rule assigns to the alert.
--
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that you create a specific cross-project alerting rule in only one of the projects that you specified in the `namespacesWithoutLabelEnforcement` field.
If you create the same cross-project alerting rule in multiple projects, it results in repeated alerts.
====

. Apply the configuration file to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f example-cross-project-alerting-rule.yaml
----
