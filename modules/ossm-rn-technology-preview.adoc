= WebAsssembly Technology Preview

{ProductName} 2.0.0 introduces support for WebAssembly extensions to Envoy Proxy.

Up through release 1.5, Istio implemented extensions using the Mixer Telemetry and Policy components. In
link:https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.5.x/announcing-1.5/upgrade-notes/#mixer-deprecation[Istio 1.5] Mixer was deprecated and link:https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.5.x/announcing-1.5/upgrade-notes/#mixer-deprecation[WebAssembly was introduced] as the new mechanism for extensions in Istio.  Envoy now allows extensions using WebAssembly (“WASM”) - a format for executing code written in multiple programming languages. Mixer has been deprecated as of Istio 1.5, and will be removed in 1.8.  Going forward, extensions to Istio will be implemented with Envoy plugins written with WebAssembly.

The new Telemetry architecture is based on these WebAssembly extensions. For {ProductShortName} 2.0, we are introducing WebAssembly extensions as a Tech Preview feature.  WebAssembly extensions is the new way of extending Istio functionality, replacing the Mixer component, which has been deprecated and will eventually be removed.

[NOTE]
====
Note that built-in Istio WASM extensions are not included in the proxy binary and that WASM filters from the upstream Istio community are not supported in {ProductName} 2.0.
