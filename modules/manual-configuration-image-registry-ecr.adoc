= Manually configuring Amazon Elastic Container Registry

You can integrate {product-title} with Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

.Prerequisites
* You must have an access key ID and a secret access key. Alternatively, you can use a node-level IAM proxy such as `kiam` or `kube2iam`.
* The access key must have read access to ECR.
See link:https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-access-key/[How do I create an AWS access key?]  for more information.
* If you are running {product-title} in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and want to integrate with an ECR from a separate Amazon account, you must first set a repository policy statement in your ECR.
Follow the instructions at link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/set-repository-policy.html[Setting a repository policy statement]  and for *Actions*, choose the following scopes of the Amazon ECR API operations:

** ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability
** ecr:BatchGetImage
** ecr:DescribeImages
** ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer
** ecr:ListImages
