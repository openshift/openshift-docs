= Recovering an etcd member for a hosted cluster

An etcd member of a 3-node cluster might fail because of corrupted or missing data. To recover the etcd member, complete the following steps.

.Procedure

. If you need to confirm that the etcd member is failing, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -l app=etcd -n <control_plane_namespace>
----
+
The output resembles this example if the etcd member is failing:

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME     READY   STATUS             RESTARTS     AGE
etcd-0   2/2     Running            0            64m
etcd-1   2/2     Running            0            45m
etcd-2   1/2     CrashLoopBackOff   1 (5s ago)   64m
----

. Delete the persistent volume claim of the failing etcd member and the pod by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete pvc/data-etcd-2 pod/etcd-2 --wait=false
----

. When the pod restarts, verify that the etcd member is added back to the etcd cluster and is correctly functioning by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -l app=etcd -n $CONTROL_PLANE_NAMESPACE
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
etcd-0   2/2     Running   0          67m
etcd-1   2/2     Running   0          48m
etcd-2   2/2     Running   0          2m2s
