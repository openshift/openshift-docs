1. Egress firewall is also known as egress network policy in OpenShift SDN. This is not the same as network policy egress.

2. Egress router for OVN-Kubernetes supports only redirect mode.

3. IPv6 is supported only on bare metal clusters.

4. Network policy for OpenShift SDN does not support egress rules and some `ipBlock` rules.
