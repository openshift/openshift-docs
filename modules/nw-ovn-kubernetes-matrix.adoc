1. Egress firewall is also known as egress network policy in OpenShift SDN. This is not the same as network policy egress.

2. Network policy for OpenShift SDN does not support egress rules and some `ipBlock` rules.

3. Egress router for OVN-Kubernetes supports only redirect mode.

4. IPv6 is supported only on bare metal clusters.
