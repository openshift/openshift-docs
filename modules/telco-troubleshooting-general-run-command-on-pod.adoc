= Running a command on a pod

If you want to run a command or set of commands on a pod without directly logging into it, you can use the `oc exec -it` command.
You can interact with the pod quickly to get process or output information from the pod.
A common use case is to run the `oc exec -it` command inside a script to run the same command on multiple pods in a replica set or deployment.

[WARNING]
====
In pods that run a low-latency application, the `oc exec` command can cause latency issues.
