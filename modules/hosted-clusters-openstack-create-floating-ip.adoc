= Creating a floating IP for ingress

If you want to make ingress available in a hosted cluster without manual intervention, you can create a floating IP address for it in advance.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the {rh-openstack-first} cloud.
* If you use a pre-defined floating IP address for ingress, you created a DNS record that points to it for the following wildcard domain: `*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, where:
** `<cluster_name>` is the name of the management cluster.
** `<base_domain>` is the parent DNS domain under which your clusterâ€™s applications live.

.Procedure

* Create a floating IP address by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openstack floating ip create <external_network_id>
----
+
--
where:

`<external_network_id>`:: Specifies the ID of the external network.
--

[NOTE]
====
If you specify a floating IP address by using the `--openstack-ingress-floating-ip` flag without creating it in advance, the `cloud-provider-openstack` component attempts to create it automatically. This process only succeeds if the
 Neutron API policy permits creating a floating IP address with a specific IP address.
