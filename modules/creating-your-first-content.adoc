// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// assembly_getting-started-modular-docs-ocp.adoc

// Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
// * file name: doing-procedure-a.adoc
// * ID: [id="doing-procedure-a"]
// * Title: = Doing procedure A

[id="creating-your-first-content_{context}"]
= Creating your first content

In this procedure, you will create your first example content using modular
docs for the OpenShift docs repository.

.Prerequisites

* You have forked and then cloned the OpenShift docs repository locally.
* You have downloaded and are using Atom text editor for creating content.
* You have installed AsciiBinder (the build tool for OpenShift docs).

.Procedure

. Navigate to your locally cloned OpenShift docs repository on a command line.

. Create a new feature branch:

+
----
git checkout master
git checkout -b my_first_mod_docs
----
+
. If there is no `modules` directory in the root folder, create one.

. In this `modules` directory, create a file called `my-first-module.adoc`.

. Open this newly created file in Atom and copy into this file the contents from
the link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs/master/modular-docs-manual/files/TEMPLATE_PROCEDURE_doing-one-procedure.adoc[procedure template]
from Modular docs repository.

. Replace the content in this file with some example text using the guidelines
in the comments. Give this module the title `My First Module`. Save this file.
You have just created your first module.

. Create a new directory from the root of your OpenShift docs repository and
call it `my_guide`.

. In this my_guide directory, create a new file called
`assembly_my-first-assembly.adoc`.

. Open this newly created file in Atom and copy into this file the contents from
the link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs/master/modular-docs-manual/files/TEMPLATE_ASSEMBLY_a-collection-of-modules.adoc[assembly template]
from Modular docs repository.

. Replace the content in this file with some example text using the guidelines
in the comments. Give this assembly the title: `My First Assembly`.

. Before the first anchor id in this assembly file, add a `:context:` attribute:

+
`:context: assembly-first-content`

. After the Prerequisites section, add the module created earlier (the following is
deliberately spelled incorrectly to pass validation. Use 'include' instead of 'ilude'):

+
`ilude::modules/my-first-module.adoc[leveloffset=+1]`

+
Remove the other includes that are present in this file. Save this file.

. Open up `my-first-module.adoc` in the `modules` folder. At the top of
this file, in the comments section, add the following to indicate in which
assembly this module is being used:

+
----
// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// my_guide/assembly_my-first-assembly.adoc
----

. Open up `_topic_map.yml` from the root folder and add these lines at the end
of this file and then save.

+
----
---
Name: OpenShift CCS Mod Docs First Guide
Dir: my_guide
Distros: openshift-*
Topics:
- Name: My First Assembly
  File: assembly_my-first-assembly
----

. On the command line, run `asciibinder` from the root folder of openshift-docs.
You do not have to add or commit your changes for asciibinder to run.

. After the asciibinder build completes, open up your browser and navigate to
<YOUR-LOCAL-GIT-REPO-LOCATION>/openshift-docs/_preview/openshift-enterprise/my_first_mod_docs/my_guide/assembly_my-first-assembly.html

. Confirm that your book `my_guide` has an assembly `My First Assembly` with the
contents from your module `My First Module`.

NOTE: You can delete this branch now if you are done testing. This branch
should not be submitted to the upstream openshift-docs repository.
