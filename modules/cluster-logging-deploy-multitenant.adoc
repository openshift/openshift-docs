= Installing cluster logging into a multitenant network

If you are deploying cluster logging into a cluster that uses multitenant isolation mode, projects are isolated from other projects. As a result, network traffic is not allowed between pods or services in different projects.

Because the Elasticsearch Operator and the Cluster Logging Operator are installed in different projects, you must explicitly allow access between the  `openshift-operators-redhat` and `openshift-logging` projects. How you allow this access depends on how you configured multitenant isolation mode.

.Procedure

To allow traffic between the Elasticsearch Operator and the Cluster Logging Operator, perform one of the following:

* If you configured multitenant isolation mode with the OpenShift SDN CNI plug-in set to the *Multitenant* mode, use the following command to join the two projects:
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm pod-network join-projects --to=openshift-operators-redhat openshift-logging
----

* If you configured multitenant isolation mode with the OpenShift SDN CNI plug-in set to the *NetworkPolicy* mode, create a network policy object in the `openshift-logging` namespace that allows ingress from the `openshift-operators-redhat` project to the `openshift-logging` project.
+
For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
