= Using the NFD Topology Updater

The Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Topology Updater is a daemon responsible for examining allocated resources on a worker node. It accounts for resources that are available to be allocated to new pod on a per-zone basis, where a zone can be a Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) node. The NFD Topology Updater communicates the information to nfd-master, which creates a `NodeResourceTopology` custom resource (CR) corresponding to all of the worker nodes in the cluster. One instance of the NFD Topology Updater runs on each node of the cluster.

To enable the Topology Updater workers in NFD, set the `topologyupdater` variable to `true` in the `NodeFeatureDiscovery` CR, as described in the section *Using the Node Feature Discovery Operator*.

== NodeResourceTopology CR

When run with NFD Topology Updater, NFD creates custom resource instances corresponding to the node resource hardware topology, such as:
