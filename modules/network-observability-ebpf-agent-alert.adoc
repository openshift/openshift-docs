= Using the eBPF agent alert

[role="_abstract"]
Resolve the `NetObservAgentFlowsDropped` alert, which occurs when the eBPF agent hashmap is full, by increasing the `spec.agent.ebpf.cacheMaxFlows` value in the `FlowCollector` custom resource.

An alert, `NetObservAgentFlowsDropped`, is also triggered when the capacity limiter is triggered. If you see this alert, consider increasing the `cacheMaxFlows` in the `FlowCollector`, as shown in the following example.

[NOTE]
====
Increasing the `cacheMaxFlows` might increase the memory usage of the eBPF agent.

.Procedure

. In the web console, navigate to *Ecosystem* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Under the *Provided APIs* heading for the *Network Observability Operator*, select *Flow Collector*.

. Select *cluster*, and then select the *YAML* tab.

. Increase the `spec.agent.ebpf.cacheMaxFlows` value, as shown in the following YAML sample:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: flows.netobserv.io/v1beta2
kind: FlowCollector
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  namespace: netobserv
  deploymentModel: Direct
  agent:
    type: eBPF
    ebpf:
      cacheMaxFlows: 200000 <1>
----
<1> Increase the `cacheMaxFlows` value from its value at the time of the `NetObservAgentFlowsDropped` alert.
