= Copied CSVs

OLM creates copies of all active member CSVs of an OperatorGroup in each of that
OperatorGroup's target namespaces. The purpose of a copied CSV is to tell users
of a target namespace that a specific Operator is configured to watch resources
created there. Copied CSVs have a status reason `Copied` and are updated to
match the status of their source CSV. The `olm.targetNamespaces` annotation is
stripped from copied CSVs before they are created on the cluster. Omitting the
target namespace selection avoids the duplication of target namespaces between
tenants. Copied CSVs are deleted when their source CSV no longer exists or the
OperatorGroup that their source CSV belongs to no longer targets the copied
CSV's namespace.
