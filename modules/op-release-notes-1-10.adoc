[id="new-features-1-10_{context}"]
== New features

In addition to fixes and stability improvements, the following sections highlight what is new in {pipelines-title} 1.10.

[id="pipelines-new-features-1-10_{context}"]
=== Pipelines

* With this update, you can specify environment variables in a `PipelineRun` or `TaskRun` pod template to override or append the variables that are configured in a task or step. Also, you can specify environment variables in a default pod template to use those variables globally for all `PipelineRuns` and `TaskRuns`. This update also adds a new default configuration named `forbidden-envs` to filter environment variables while propagating from pod templates.
* With this update, custom tasks in pipelines are enabled by default. 
+
[NOTE]
====
To disable this update, set the `enable-custom-tasks` flag to `false` in the `feature-flags` config custom resource.
====

* This update supports the `v1beta1.CustomRun` API version for custom tasks.
* This update adds support for the `PipelineRun` reconciler to create a custom run. For example, custom `TaskRuns` created from `PipelineRuns` can now use the `v1beta1.CustomRun` API version instead of `v1alpha1.Run`, if the `custom-task-version` feature flag is set to `v1beta1`, instead of the default value `v1alpha1`. 
+
[NOTE]
====
You need to update the custom task controller to listen for the `*v1beta1.CustomRun` API version instead of `*v1alpha1.Run` in order to respond to `v1beta1.CustomRun` requests.
====

* This update adds a new `retries` field to the `v1beta1.TaskRun` and `v1.TaskRun` specifications.


[id="triggers-new-features-1-10_{context}"]
=== Triggers

* With this update, triggers support the creation of `Pipelines`, `Tasks`, `PipelineRuns`, and `TaskRuns` objects of the `v1` API version along with `CustomRun` objects of the `v1beta1` API version.
* With this update, GitHub Interceptor blocks a pull request trigger from being executed unless invoked by an owner or with a configurable comment by an owner.
+
[NOTE]
====
To enable or disable this update, set the value of the `githubOwners` parameter to `true` or `false` in the GitHub Interceptor configuration file.
====

* With this update, GitHub Interceptor has the ability to add a comma delimited list of all files that have changed for the push and pull request events. The list of changed files is added to the `changed_files` property of the event payload in the top-level extensions field.
* This update changes the `MinVersion` of TLS to `tls.VersionTLS12` so that triggers run on {product-title} when the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) mode is enabled.


[id="cli-new-features-1-10_{context}"]
=== CLI

* This update adds support to pass a Container Storage Interface (CSI) file as a workspace at the time of starting a `Task`, `ClusterTask` or `Pipeline`. 
* This update adds `v1` API support to all CLI commands associated with task, pipeline, pipeline run, and task run resources. Tekton CLI works with both `v1beta1` and `v1` APIs for these resources.
* This update adds support for an object type parameter in the `start` and `describe` commands.


[id="operator-new-features-1-10_{context}"]
=== Operator

* This update adds a `default-forbidden-env` parameter in optional pipeline properties. The parameter includes forbidden environment variables that should not be propagated if provided through pod templates.
* This update adds support for custom logos in Tekton Hub UI. To add a custom logo, set the value of the `customLogo` parameter to base64 encoded URI of logo in the Tekton Hub CR. 
* This update increments the version number of the git-clone task to 0.9.


[id="chains-new-features-1-10_{context}"]
=== Tekton Chains

* This update adds annotations and labels to the `PipelineRun` and `TaskRun` attestations.
* This update adds a new format named `slsa/v1`, which generates the same provenance as the one generated when requesting in the `in-toto` format.
* With this update, Sigstore features are moved out from the experimental features.
* With this update, the `predicate.materials` function includes image URI and digest information from all steps and sidecars for a `TaskRun` object.


[id="tekton-hub-new-features-1-10_{context}"]
=== {tekton-hub}

* This update supports installing, upgrading, or downgrading Tekton resources of the `v1` API version on the cluster.
* This update supports adding a custom logo in place of the {tekton-hub} logo in UI.
* This update extends the `tkn hub install` command functionality by adding a `--type artifact` flag, which fetches resources from the Artifact Hub and installs them on your cluster.
* This update adds support tier, catalog, and org information as labels to the resources being installed from Artifact Hub to your cluster.


[id="pac-new-features-1-10_{context}"]
=== {pac}

* This update enhances incoming webhook support. For a GitHub application installed on the {product-title} cluster, you do not need to provide the `git_provider` specification for an incoming webhook. Instead, {pac} detects the secret and use it for the incoming webhook.
* With this update, you can use the same token to fetch remote tasks from the same host on GitHub with a non-default branch.
* With this update, {pac} supports Tekton `v1` templates. You can have `v1` and `v1beta1` templates, which {pac} reads for PR generation. The PR is created as `v1` on cluster.
* Before this update, OpenShift console UI would use a hardcoded pipeline run template as a fallback template when a runtime template was not found in the OpenShift namespace. This update in the `pipelines-as-code` config map provides a new default pipeline run template named, `pipelines-as-code-template-default` for the console to use.
* With this update, {pac} supports Tekton Pipelines 0.44.0 minimal status. 
* With this update, {pac} supports Tekton `v1` API, which means {pac} is now compatible with Tekton v0.44 and later.
* With this update, you can configure custom console dashboards in addition to configuring a console for OpenShift and Tekton dashboards for k8s.
* With this update, {pac} detects the installation of a GitHub application initiated using the `tkn pac create repo` command and does not require a GitHub webhook if it was installed globally.
* Before this update, if there was an error on a `PipelineRun` execution and not on the tasks attached to `PipelineRun`, {pac} would not report the failure properly. With this update, {pac} reports the error properly on the GitHub checks when a `PipelineRun` could not be created.  
* With this update, {pac} includes a `target_namespace` variable, which expands to the currently running namespace where the `PipelineRun` is executed.
* With this update, {pac} lets you bypass GitHub enterprise questions in the CLI bootstrap GitHub application.
* With this update, {pac} does not report errors when the repository CR was not found.
* With this update, {pac} reports an error if multiple pipeline runs with the same name were found.


[id="breaking-changes-1-10_{context}"]
== Breaking changes

* With this update, the prior version of the `tkn` command is not compatible with {pipelines-title} 1.10.
* This update removes support for `Cluster` and `CloudEvent` pipeline resources from Tekton CLI. You cannot create pipeline resources by using the `tkn pipelineresource create` command. Also, pipeline resources are no longer supported in the `start` command of a task, cluster task, or pipeline.
* This update removes `tekton` as a provenance format from Tekton Chains.


[id="deprecated-features-1-10_{context}"]
== Deprecated and removed features

* In {pipelines-title} 1.10, the `ClusterTask` commands are now deprecated and are planned to be removed in a future release. The `tkn task create` command is also deprecated with this update. 
* In {pipelines-title} 1.10, the flags `-i` and `-o` that were used with the `tkn task start` command are now deprecated because the `v1` API does not support pipeline resources.
* In {pipelines-title} 1.10, the flag `-r` that was used with the `tkn pipeline start` command is deprecated because the `v1` API does not support pipeline resources.
* The {pipelines-title} 1.10 update sets the `openshiftDefaultEmbeddedStatus` parameter to `both` with `full` and `minimal` embedded status. The flag to change the default embedded status  is also deprecated and will be removed. In addition, the pipeline default embedded status will be changed to `minimal` in a future release.

[id="known-issues-1-10_{context}"]
== Known issues

* This update includes the following backward incompatible changes:
** Removal of the `PipelineResources` cluster
** Removal of the `PipelineResources` cloud event
* If the pipelines metrics feature does not work after a cluster upgrade, run the following command as a workaround:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get tektoninstallersets.operator.tekton.dev | awk '/pipeline-main-static/ {print $1}' | xargs oc delete tektoninstallersets
----
* With this update, usage of external databases, such as the Crunchy PostgreSQL is not supported on {ibmpowerProductName}, {ibmzProductName}, and {linuxoneProductName}. Instead, use the default {tekton-hub} database. 

[id="fixed-issues-1-10_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

* Before this update, the `opc pac` command generated a runtime error instead of showing any help. This update fixes the `opc pac` command to show the help message.
* Before this update, running the `tkn pac create repo` command needed the webhook details for creating a repository. With this update, the `tkn-pac create repo` command does not configure a webhook when your GitHub application is installed.
* Before this update, {pac} would not report a pipeline run creation error when Tekton Pipelines had issues creating the `PipelineRun` resource. For example, a non-existing task in a pipeline run would show no status. With this update, {pac} shows the proper error message coming from Tekton Pipelines along with the task that is missing.
* This update fixes UI page redirection after a successful authentication. Now, you are redirected to the same page where you had attempted to log in to Tekton Hub.
* This update fixes the `list` command with these flags, `--all-namespaces` and `--output=yaml`, for a cluster task, an individual task, and a pipeline.
* This update removes the forward slash in the end of the `repo.spec.url` URL so that it matches the URL coming from GitHub.
* Before this update, the `marshalJSON` function would not marshal a list of objects. With this update, the `marshalJSON` function marshals the list of objects.
* With this update, {pac} lets you bypass GitHub enterprise questions in the CLI bootstrap GitHub application.
* This update fixes the GitHub collaborator check when your repository has more than 100 users.
* With this update, the `sign` and `verify` commands for a task or pipeline now work without a kubernetes configuration file.
* With this update, Tekton Operator cleans leftover pruner cron jobs if pruner has been skipped on a namespace.
* Before this update, the API `ConfigMap` object would not be updated with a user configured value for a catalog refresh interval. This update fixes the `CATALOG_REFRESH_INTERVAL` API in the Tekon Hub CR.
* This update fixes reconciling of `PipelineRunStatus` when changing the `EmbeddedStatus` feature flag. This update resets the following parameters: 
** The `status.runs` and `status.taskruns` parameters to `nil` with `minimal EmbeddedStatus` 
** The `status.childReferences` parameter to `nil` with `full EmbeddedStatus`
* This update adds a conversion configuration to the `ResolutionRequest` CRD. This update properly configures conversion from the `v1alpha1.ResolutionRequest` request to the `v1beta1.ResolutionRequest` request.
* This update checks for duplicate workspaces associated with a pipeline task.
* This update fixes the default value for enabling resolvers in the code.
* This update fixes `TaskRef` and `PipelineRef` names conversion by using a resolver.
