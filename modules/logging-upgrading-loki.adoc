= Updating the {loki-op}

To update the {loki-op} to a new major release version, you must modify the update channel for the Operator subscription.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {loki-op}.
* You have administrator permissions.
* You have access to the {ocp-product-title} web console and are viewing the *Administrator* perspective.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Select the *openshift-operators-redhat* project.

. Click the *{loki-op}*.

. Click *Subscription*. In the *Subscription details* section, click the *Update channel* link. This link text might be *stable* or *stable-5.y*, depending on your current update channel.

. In the *Change Subscription Update Channel* window, select the update channel, *stable-6.y*, and click *Save*. Note the `loki-operator.v6.y.z` version.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only update to an N+2 version, where N is your current version. For example, if you are upgrading from Logging 5.8, select `stable-6.0` as the update channel. Updating to a version that is more than two versions newer is not supported.
====

. Wait for a few seconds, then click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*. Verify that the {loki-op} version matches the latest `loki-operator.v6.y.z` version.

. On the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page, wait for the *Status* field to report *Succeeded*.

. Check if the `LokiStack` custom resource contains the `v13` schema version and add it if it is missing. For correctly adding the `v13` schema version, see "Upgrading the LokiStack storage schema".
