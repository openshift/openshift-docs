= Determining why user-defined project metrics are unavailable

If metrics are not displaying when monitoring user-defined projects, follow these steps to troubleshoot the issue.

.Procedure

. Query the metric name and verify that the project is correct:
.. From the *Developer* perspective in the OpenShift Container Platform web console, select *Monitoring* -> *Metrics*.
.. Select the project that you want to view metrics for in the *Project:* list.
.. Choose a query from the *Select Query* list, or run a custom PromQL query by selecting *Show PromQL*.
+
The *Select Query* pane shows the metric names.
+
Queries must be done on a per-project basis. The metrics that are shown relate to the project that you have selected.
. Verify that the pod that you want metrics from is actively serving metrics. Run the following `oc exec` command into a pod to target the `podIP`, `port`, and `/metrics`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec <sample_pod> -n <sample_namespace> -- curl <target_pod_IP>:<port>/metrics
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You must run the command on a pod that has `curl` installed.
====
+
The following example output shows a result with a valid version metric.

An invalid output indicates that there is a problem with the corresponding application.

. If you are using a `PodMonitor` CRD, verify that the `PodMonitor` CRD is configured to point to the correct pods using label matching. For more information, see the Prometheus Operator documentation.
. If you are using a `ServiceMonitor` CRD, and if the `/metrics` endpoint of the pod is showing metric data, follow these steps to verify the configuration:
.. Verify that the service is pointed to the correct `/metrics` endpoint. The service `labels` in this output must match the services monitor `labels` and the `/metrics` endpoint defined by the service in the subsequent steps.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get service

  type: ClusterIP
----
+
<1> Specifies that this is a service API.
<2> Specifies the labels that are being used for this service.

.. Query the `serviceIP`, `port`, and `/metrics` endpoints to see if the same metrics from the `curl` command you ran on the pod previously:
... Run the following command to find the service IP:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get service -n <target_namespace>
----
... Query the `/metrics` endpoint:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec <sample_pod> -n <sample_namespace> -- curl <service_IP>:<port>/metrics
----
+
Valid metrics are returned in the following example.

----
.. Use label matching to verify that the `ServiceMonitor` object is configured to point to the desired service. To do this, compare the `Service` object from the `oc get service` output to the `ServiceMonitor` object from the `oc get servicemonitor` output. The labels must match for the metrics to be displayed.
+
For example, from the previous steps, notice how the `Service` object has the `app: prometheus-example-app` label and the `ServiceMonitor` object has the same `app: prometheus-example-app` match label.
. If everything looks valid and the metrics are still unavailable, please contact the support team for further help.
