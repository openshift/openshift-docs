= Containers

Containers provide a standard way to package your application code, configurations, and dependencies into a single unit. Containers run as isolated processes on compute hosts and share the host operating system and its hardware resources. A container can be moved between environments and run without changes. Unlike virtual machines, containers do not virtualize a device, its operating system, and the underlying hardware. Only the app code, run time, system tools, libraries, and settings are packaged inside the container. This approach makes a container more lightweight, portable, and efficient than a virtual machine.

Built on existing Linux container technology (LXC), the OCI-compliant container images define templates for how to package software into standardized units that include all of the elements that an app needs to run. {product-title} (ROSA) uses CRI-O as the container runtime to deploy containers to your cluster.

To run your app in Kubernetes on ROSA, you must first containerize your app by creating a container image that you store in a container registry.

Image:: A container image is the base for every container that you want to run. Container images are built from a Dockerfile, a text file that defines how to build the image and which build artifacts to include in it, such as the app, the app configuration, and its dependencies. Images are always built from other images, making them quick to configure.

Registry:: An image registry is a place to store, retrieve, and share container images. Images that are stored in a registry can either be publicly available (public registry) or accessible by a small group of users (private registry). ROSA offers public images that you can use to create your first containerized app. For enterprise applications, use a private registry to protect your images from being used by unauthorized users.
