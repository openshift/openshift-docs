= Creating a buildpacks build

Learn how to create a buildpacks build and push the created image into the target registry.
There are two buildpacks `ClusterBuildStrategy` options available for {builds-title}:

* `buildpacks` strategy
* `buildpacks-extender` strategy

[NOTE]
====
The `buildpacks-extender` strategy is compatible with the experimental buildpacks `extender` lifecycle phase. You can use this strategy, for example, for builds based on Node.js. However, the `extender` phase does not support Quarkus, or any other Java-based builds. For such builds, you use the `buildpacks` strategy instead.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Buildpacks is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red{nbsp}Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red{nbsp}Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red{nbsp}Hat Technology Preview features, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Support Scope].

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {builds-operator} on the {ocp-product-title} cluster.
* You have installed the `oc` CLI.
* You have created the project where your final application image is stored by using the command `oc new-project buildpacks-example`.
* Optional: You have installed the `shp` CLI.


[IMPORTANT]
====
Using `shp` CLI with buildpacks requires additional permissions setup that
you must complete before you start creating a buildpacks build.
====

.Procedure
. OPTIONAL: To use the `shp` CLI with buildpacks, you must first grant permission to the `pipeline` service account to access the image registry in the `buildpacks-example` project  with the following two commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user system:image-puller system:serviceaccount:default:pipeline --namespace=buildpacks-example
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user system:image-pusher system:serviceaccount:default:pipeline --namespace=buildpacks-example
----
. OPTIONAL: Continue with `shp` CLI by switching back to the primary working project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project default
----
. OPTIONAL: Finish `shp` CLI setup by applying the permission:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create rolebinding allow-builds-to-push \

  --clusterrole=edit \

 --serviceaccount=default:pipeline \

--namespace=buildpacks-example
----
. Create a `Build` resource and apply it to the {ocp-product-title} cluster:
.. Using `oc` CLI
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f - <<EOF

. Check if the `Build` resource was created:
.. Using `oc` CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get builds.shipwright.io buildpack-nodejs-build
----
.. Using `shp` CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ shp build list
----

. Create a `BuildRun` resource and apply it to the {ocp-product-title} cluster:
.. Using `oc` CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1beta1
kind: BuildRun
metadata:
  name: buildpack-nodejs-buildrun
  namespace: builds-test
spec:
  build:
    name: buildpack-nodejs-build <1>
EOF
----
<1> Reference to the `buildpack-nodejs-build` resource that will be executed.
.. Using `shp` CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ shp build run buildpack-nodejs-buildrun --follow
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `shp` CLI version 0.16.0 cannot automatically generate a name for the `BuildRun` resource.
You must create the name manually:


. Create a `BuildRun` resource with a unique name
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ shp buildrun create buildpack-nodejs-<buildrun_resource_name>  --buildref-name buildpack-nodejs-build <1>
----
<1> Flag referencing the build.

. Follow the logs:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ shp buildrun logs buildpack-nodej-<buildrun_resource_name> --follow
----
====

. Check if the `BuildRun` resource was created:
.. Using `oc` CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get buildrun buildpack-nodejs-buildrun
----
.. Using `shp` CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ shp buildrun list
----

[NOTE]
====
The `BuildRun` resource creates a `TaskRun` resource, which then creates the pods to execute build strategy steps.
====

.Verification
. Wait for all containers to complete their tasks.
. Check if the pod shows the `STATUS` field as `Completed`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -w
----
. Check if the `TaskRun` resource shows the `SUCCESS` field as `True`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get tr
----
. Check if the `BuildRun` resource shows the `SUCCESS` field as `True`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get br
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If the build run fails, you can check the `status.failureDetails` field in your `BuildRun` resource to identify the exact point where the failure happened in the pod or container.

The pod might switch to a `NotReady` state because one of the containers has completed its task. This is an expected behavior.
====
. Check if the image has been pushed to the registry you specified in the `build.spec.output.image` field by running the following command from a node that can access the internal registry to pull the image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman pull
----
+
[NOTE]
====
An example output of the `podman pull` command might look like this:

. Example output
[source,terminal]
----
$ image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/buildpacks-example/taxi-app
----

The project name in this example is `buildpacks-example`, and the image name is `taxi-app`.
