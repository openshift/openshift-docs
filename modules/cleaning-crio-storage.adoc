= Cleaning CRI-O storage

You can manually clear the CRI-O ephemeral storage if you experience the following issues:

* A node cannot run on any pods and this error appears:
[source, terminal]
+
----
Failed to create pod sandbox: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to mount container XXX: error recreating the missing symlinks: error reading name of symlink for XXX: open /var/lib/containers/storage/overlay/XXX/link: no such file or directory
----
+
* You cannot create a new container on a working node and the  “can’t stat lower layer” error appears:
[source, terminal]
+
----
can't stat lower layer ...  because it does not exist.  Going through storage to recreate the missing symlinks.
----
+
* Your node is in the `NotReady` state after a cluster upgrade or if you attempt to reboot it.

* The container runtime implementation (`crio`) is not working properly.

* You are unable to start a debug shell on the node using `oc debug node/<nodename>` because the container runtime instance (`crio`) is not working.

Follow this process to completely wipe the CRI-O storage and resolve the errors.

.Prerequisites:

  * You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
  * You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Use `cordon` on the node. This is to avoid any workload getting scheduled if the node gets into the `Ready` status. You will know that scheduling is disabled when `SchedulingDisabled` is in your Status section:
[source, terminal]
+
----
$ oc adm cordon <nodename>
----
+
. Drain the node as the cluster-admin user:
[source, terminal]
+
----
$ oc adm drain <nodename> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-local-data
----
+
. When the node returns, connect back to the node via SSH or Console. Then connect to the root user:
[source, terminal]
+
----
$ ssh core@node1.example.com
$ sudo -i
----
+
. Manually stop the kubelet:
[source, terminal]
+
----
# systemctl stop kubelet
----
+
. Stop the containers and pods:
[source, terminal]
+
----
# crictl rmp -fa
----
+
. Manually stop the crio services:
[source, terminal]
+
----
# systemctl stop crio
----
+
. After you run those commands, you can completely wipe the ephemeral storage:
[source, terminal]
+
----
# crio wipe -f
----
+
. Start the crio and kubelet service:
[source, terminal]
+
----
# systemctl start crio
# systemctl start kubelet
----
+
. You will know if the clean up worked if the crio and kubelet services are started, and the node is in the `Ready` status:
[source, terminal]
+
----
$ oc get nodes
----
+
.Example output
[source, terminal]
+
----
NAME				    STATUS	                ROLES    AGE    VERSION
ci-ln-tkbxyft-f76d1-nvwhr-master-1  Ready, SchedulingDisabled   master	 133m   v1.23.0
----
+
. Mark the node schedulable. You will know that the scheduling is enabled when `SchedulingDisabled` is no longer in status:
[source, terminal]
+
----
$ oc adm uncordon <nodename>
----
+
.Example output
[source, terminal]
+
----
NAME				     STATUS	      ROLES    AGE    VERSION
ci-ln-tkbxyft-f76d1-nvwhr-master-1   Ready            master   133m   v1.23.0
