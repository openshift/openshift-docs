= Accessing a virtual machine instance via SSH

You can use SSH to access a virtual machine after you expose port
22 on it.

The `virtctl expose` command forwards a virtual machine instance port to a node
port and creates a service for enabled access. The following example creates
the `fedora-vm-ssh` service that forwards port 22 of the `<fedora-vm>` virtual
machine to a port on the node:

.Prerequisites
* The virtual machine instance you want to access must be connected
to the default Pod network by using the `masquerade` binding method.
* The virtual machine instance you want to access must be running.
* Install the OpenShift Command-line Interface (CLI), commonly known as `oc`.

.Procedure
. Run the following command to create the `fedora-vm-ssh` service:
+
----
$ virtctl expose vm <fedora-vm> --port=20022 --target-port=22 --name=fedora-vm-ssh --type=NodePort <1>
----
<1> `<fedora-vm>` is the name of the virtual machine that you run the
`fedora-vm-ssh` service on.

. Check the service to find out which port the service acquired:
+
----
$ oc get svc
NAME            TYPE       CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)           AGE
fedora-vm-ssh   NodePort   127.0.0.1      <none>        20022:32551/TCP   6s
----
+
In this example, the service acquired the `32551` port.

. Log in to  the virtual machine instance via SSH. Use the `ipAddress` of the
node and the port that you found in the previous step:
+
----
$ ssh username@<node_IP_address> -p 32551
----
