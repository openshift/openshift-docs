[id="virt-accessing-vmi-ssh_{context}"]
= Accessing a virtual machine via SSH by using virtctl

You can use the `virtctl ssh` command to forward SSH traffic to a virtual machine (VM) by using your local SSH client. If you have previously configured SSH key authentication with the VM, skip to step 2 of the procedure because step 1 is not required.

[NOTE]
====
Heavy SSH traffic on the control plane can slow down the API server. If you regularly need a large number of connections, use a dedicated Kubernetes `Service` object to access the virtual machine.
====


.Prerequisites
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have installed the `virtctl` client.
* The virtual machine you want to access is running.
* You are in the same project as the VM.


.Procedure

. Configure SSH key authentication:
.. Use the `ssh-keygen` command to generate an SSH public key pair:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh-keygen -f <key_file> <1>
----
<1> Specify the file in which to store the keys.

.. Create an SSH authentication secret which contains the SSH public key to access the VM:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create secret generic my-pub-key --from-file=key1=<key_file>.pub
----

.. Add a reference to the secret in the `VirtualMachine` manifest. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: testvm
spec:
  running: true
  template:
    spec:
      accessCredentials:
      - sshPublicKey:
          source:
            secret:
              secretName: my-pub-key <1>
          propagationMethod:
            configDrive: {} <2>
# ...
----
<1> Reference to the SSH authentication `Secret` object.
<2> The SSH public key is injected into the VM as cloud-init metadata using the `configDrive` provider.

.. Restart the VM to apply your changes.

. Connect to the VM via SSH: 
.. Run the following command to access the VM via SSH:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ virtctl ssh -i <key_file> <vm_username>@<vm_name>
----

.. Optional: To securely transfer files to or from the VM, use the following commands:
+

.Copy a file from your machine to the VM
[source,terminal]
----
$ virtctl scp -i <key_file> <filename> <vm_username>@<vm_name>:
----
+
.Copy a file from the VM to your machine
[source,terminal]
----
$ virtctl scp -i <key_file> <vm_username@<vm_name>:<filename> .
----
