= Network Observability Operator 1.5.0 fixed issues

[role="_abstract"]
You can view the following fixed issues for the Network Observability Operator 1.5 release.

* Previously, it was not possible to register the console plugin manually in the web console interface if the automatic registration of the console plugin was disabled. If the `spec.console.register` value was set to `false` in the `FlowCollector` resource, the Operator would override and erase the plugin registration.
With this fix, setting the `spec.console.register` value to `false` does not impact the console plugin registration or registration removal. As a result, the plugin can be safely registered manually. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1134[*NETOBSERV-1134*])
* Previously, using the default metrics settings, the *NetObserv/Health* dashboard was showing an empty graph named *Flows Overhead*. This metric was only available by removing "namespaces-flows" and "namespaces" from the `ignoreTags` list. With this fix, this metric is visible when you use the default metrics setting. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1351[*NETOBSERV-1351*])
* Previously, the node on which the eBPF Agent was running would not resolve with a specific cluster configuration. This resulted in cascading consequences that culminated in a failure to provide some of the traffic metrics. With this fix, the eBPF agent's node IP is safely provided by the Operator, inferred from the pod status. Now, the missing metrics are restored. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1430[*NETOBSERV-1430*])
* Previously, the Loki error 'Input size too long' error for the Loki Operator did not include additional information to troubleshoot the problem.
With this fix, help is directly displayed in the web console next to the error with a direct link for more guidance. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1464[*NETOBSERV-1464*])
* Previously, the console plugin read timeout was forced to 30s.
With the `FlowCollector` `v1beta2` API update, you can configure the `spec.loki.readTimeout` specification to update this value according to the Loki Operator `queryTimeout` limit. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1443[*NETOBSERV-1443*])
* Previously, the Operator bundle did not display some of the supported features by CSV annotations as expected, such as `features.operators.openshift.io/...`
With this fix, these annotations are set in the CSV as expected. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1305[*NETOBSERV-1305*])
* Previously, the `FlowCollector` status sometimes oscillated between `DeploymentInProgress` and `Ready` states during reconciliation.
With this fix, the status only becomes `Ready` when all of the underlying components are fully ready. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/NETOBSERV-1293[*NETOBSERV-1293*])
