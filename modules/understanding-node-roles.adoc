= Understanding node roles

OpenShift Container Platform assigns hosts different roles. These roles define the function of the node within the cluster. The cluster contains standard definitions for standard role types, such as   master and worker. The bootstrap role does not exist outside of the initial installation.

Worker nodes are controlled by MachineSets. Instead of being grouped into a MachineSet, master nodes are defined by a series of standalone machine API resources. Extra controls apply to master nodes to prevent you from deleting all master nodes and breaking your cluster. Nodes with the worker role drive compute workloads. Each type of worker node is governed by a specific machine pool that autoscales them.
