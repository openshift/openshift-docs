New in this release::

* No reference design updates in this release.

Description::
+
--
{cgu-operator} is an Operator that runs only on the hub cluster for managing how changes like cluster upgrades, Operator upgrades, and cluster configuration are rolled out to the network. {cgu-operator} supports the following features:

* Progressive rollout of policy updates to fleets of clusters in user configurable batches.
* Per-cluster actions add `ztp-done` labels or other user-configurable labels following configuration changes to managed clusters.

* {cgu-operator} supports optional pre-caching of {product-title}, {olm} Operator, and additional images to {sno} clusters before initiating an upgrade. The pre-caching feature is not applicable when using the recommended image-based upgrade method for upgrading {sno} clusters.

** Specifying optional pre-caching configurations with `PreCachingConfig` CRs.

** Configurable image filtering to exclude unused content.

** Storage validation before and after pre-caching, using defined space requirement parameters.
--

Limits and requirements::

* {cgu-operator} supports concurrent cluster upgrades in batches of 500.
* Pre-caching is limited to {sno} cluster topology.

Engineering considerations::

* The `PreCachingConfig` custom resource (CR) is optional. You do not need to create it if you want to pre-cache platform-related images only, such as {product-title} and {olm}.
* {cgu-operator} supports the use of hub-side templating with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management policies.
