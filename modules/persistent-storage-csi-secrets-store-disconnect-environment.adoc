= Support for disconnected environments

The following secrets store providers support using the {secrets-store-driver} in disconnected clusters:

* AWS Secrets Manager
* Azure Key Vault
* Google Secret Manager
* HashiCorp Vault

To enable communication between {secrets-store-driver} and the secrets store provider, configure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) endpoints or equivalent connectivity to the corresponding secrets store provider, the OpenID Connect (OIDC) issuer, and the Secure Token Service (STS). The exact configuration depends on the secrets store provider, the authentication method, and the type of disconnected cluster.
