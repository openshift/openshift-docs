= Observing the network traffic from the Overview view

[role="_abstract"]
The Network Traffic *Overview* view provides aggregated flow metrics and visual insights into application communications. Administrators can use the metrics to monitor data volume, troubleshoot connectivity, and detect unusual traffic patterns across the cluster.

The *Overview* view shows aggregate network traffic in your {product-title} cluster, allowing you to see which applications are communicating and the volume of data being transferred. It provides detailed insights by source, destination, and flow type, along with the top traffic flows and average byte rates.

As an administrator, you can troubleshoot connectivity issues, detect unusual traffic patterns, and optimize application performance. It provides a quick overview of network behavior, making it easier to prioritize actions and ensure efficient resource usage.
