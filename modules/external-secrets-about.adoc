= About the {external-secrets-operator}

Use the {external-secrets-operator} to integrate link:https://external-secrets.io/latest/[external-secrets] application with the {product-title} cluster. The `external-secrets` application fetches secrets stored in the external providers such as link:https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/[AWS Secrets Manager], link:https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault[HashiCorp Vault], link:https://cloud.google.com/security/products/secret-manager[Google Secret Manager], link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/key-vault/[Azure Key Vault], link:https://www.ibm.com/products/secrets-manager[{ibm-cloud-title} Secrets Manager], link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html[AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store] and integrates them with Kubernetes in a secure manner.

Using the {external-secrets-operator-short} ensures the following:

* Decouples applications from the secret-lifecycle management.
* Centralizes secret storage to support compliance requirements.
* Enables secure and automated secret rotation.
* Supports multi-cloud secret sourcing with fine-grained access control.
* Centralizes and audits access control.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not attempt to use more than one {external-secrets-operator-short} in your cluster. If you have a community {external-secrets-operator-short} installed in your cluster, you must uninstall it before installing the {external-secrets-operator}.
====

For more information about `external-secrets` application, see link:https://external-secrets.io/latest/[external-secrets].

Use the {external-secrets-operator-short} to authenticate with the external secrets store, retrieve secrets, and inject the retrieved secrets into a native Kubernetes secret. This method removes the need for applications to directly access or manage external secrets.
