[id="ossm-config-control-plane-infrastructure-node-cli_{context}"]
= Configuring all control plane components to run on infrastructure nodes using the CLI

Perform this task if all of the components deployed by the {SMProductShortName} control plane will run on infrastructure nodes. These deployed components include Istiod, Ingress Gateway, and Egress Gateway, and optional applications such as Prometheus, Grafana, and Distributed Tracing.

If the control plane will run on a worker node, skip this task.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {SMProductName} Operator.
ifndef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* You are logged in to {product-title} as`cluster-admin`.
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
ifdef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* You are logged in to {product-title} as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Open the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource as a YAML file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n istio-system edit smcp <name> <1>
----
<1> `<name>` represents the name of the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.

. To run all of the {SMProductShortName} components deployed by the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` on infrastructure nodes, add the `nodeSelector` and `tolerations` fields to the `spec.runtime.defaults.pod` spec in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  runtime:
    defaults:
      pod:
        nodeSelector: <1>
          node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
        tolerations: <2>
        - effect: NoSchedule
          key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
          value: reserved
        - effect: NoExecute
          key: node-role.kubernetes.io/infra
          value: reserved
----
<1> Ensures that the SMCP pods are only scheduled on an infrastructure node.
<2> Ensures that the pods are accepted by the infrastructure node.
