= Updating remediations

When a new version of compliance content is used, it might deliver a new and different version of a remediation than the previous version. The Compliance Operator will keep the old version of the remediation applied. The {product-title} administrator is also notified of the new version to review and apply. A ComplianceRemediation object that had been applied earlier, but was updated changes its status to *Outdated*. The outdated objects are labeled so that they can be searched for easily.

The previously applied remediation contents would then be stored in the `spec.outdated` attribute of a `ComplianceRemediation` object and the new updated contents would be stored in the `spec.current` attribute. After updating the content to a newer version, the administrator then needs to review the remediation. As long as the `spec.outdated` attribute exists, it would be used to render the resulting `MachineConfig` object. After the `spec.outdated` attribute is removed, the Compliance Operator re-renders the resulting `MachineConfig` object, which causes the Operator to push the configuration to the nodes.

.Procedure

. Search for any outdated remediations:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get complianceremediations -lcomplianceoperator.openshift.io/outdated-remediation=
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                              STATE
workers-scan-no-empty-passwords   Outdated
----
+
The currently applied remediation is stored in the `Outdated` attribute and the new, unapplied remediation is stored in the `Current` attribute. If you are satisfied with the new version, remove the `Outdated` field. If you want to keep the updated content, remove the `Current` and `Outdated` attributes.

. Apply the newer version of the remediation:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch complianceremediations workers-scan-no-empty-passwords --type json -p '[{"op":"remove", "path":/spec/outdated}]'
----

. The remediation state will switch from `Outdated` to `Applied`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get complianceremediations workers-scan-no-empty-passwords
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                              STATE
workers-scan-no-empty-passwords   Applied
----

. The nodes will apply the newer remediation version and reboot.
