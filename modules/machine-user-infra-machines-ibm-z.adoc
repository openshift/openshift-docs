= Creating {op-system} machines on {ibm-z-title} with z/VM

You can create more {op-system-first} compute machines running on {ibm-z-name} with z/VM and attach them to your existing cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You have a domain name server (DNS) that can perform hostname and reverse lookup for the nodes.
* You have an HTTP or HTTPS server running on your provisioning machine that is accessible to the machines you create.

.Procedure
// Step 1 is a workaround for https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-18394
// Can be removed when bug is fixed.
. Disable UDP aggregation.
+
Currently, UDP aggregation is not supported on {ibm-z-name} and is not automatically deactivated on multi-architecture compute clusters with an `x86_64` control plane and additional `s390x` compute machines. To ensure that the addtional compute nodes are added to the cluster correctly, you must manually disable UDP aggregation.

.. Create a YAML file `udp-aggregation-config.yaml` with the following content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
data:
  disable-udp-aggregation: "true"
metadata:
  name: udp-aggregation-config
  namespace: openshift-network-operator
----

.. Create the ConfigMap resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f udp-aggregation-config.yaml
----

. Extract the Ignition config file from the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc extract -n openshift-machine-api secret/worker-user-data-managed --keys=userData --to=- > worker.ign
----

. Upload the `worker.ign` Ignition config file you exported from your cluster to your HTTP server. Note the URL of this file.

. You can validate that the Ignition file is available on the URL. The following example gets the Ignition config file for the compute node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -k http://<http_server>/worker.ign
----

. Download the {op-system-base} live `kernel`, `initramfs`, and `rootfs` files by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -LO $(oc -n openshift-machine-config-operator get configmap/coreos-bootimages -o jsonpath='{.data.stream}' \
| jq -r '.architectures.s390x.artifacts.metal.formats.pxe.kernel.location')
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -LO $(oc -n openshift-machine-config-operator get configmap/coreos-bootimages -o jsonpath='{.data.stream}' \
| jq -r '.architectures.s390x.artifacts.metal.formats.pxe.initramfs.location')
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -LO $(oc -n openshift-machine-config-operator get configmap/coreos-bootimages -o jsonpath='{.data.stream}' \
| jq -r '.architectures.s390x.artifacts.metal.formats.pxe.rootfs.location')
----

. Move the downloaded {op-system-base} live `kernel`, `initramfs`, and `rootfs` files to an HTTP or HTTPS server that is accessible from the z/VM guest you want to add.

. Create a parameter file for the z/VM guest. The following parameters are specific for the virtual machine:
** Optional: To specify a static IP address, add an `ip=` parameter with the following entries, with each separated by a colon:
... The IP address for the machine.
... An empty string.
... The gateway.
... The netmask.
... The machine host and domain name in the form `hostname.domainname`. Omit this value to let {op-system} decide.
... The network interface name. Omit this value to let {op-system} decide.
... The value `none`.
** For `coreos.inst.ignition_url=`, specify the URL to the `worker.ign` file. Only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported.
** For `coreos.live.rootfs_url=`, specify the matching rootfs artifact for the `kernel` and `initramfs` you are booting. Only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported.

** For installations on DASD-type disks, complete the following tasks:
... For `coreos.inst.install_dev=`, specify `/dev/dasda`.
... Use `rd.dasd=` to specify the DASD where {op-system} is to be installed.
... You can adjust further parameters if required.
+
The following is an example parameter file, `additional-worker-dasd.parm`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
rd.neednet=1 \
console=ttysclp0 \
coreos.inst.install_dev=/dev/dasda \
coreos.live.rootfs_url=http://<http_server>/rhcos-<version>-live-rootfs.<architecture>.img \
coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://<http_server>/worker.ign \
ip=<ip>::<gateway>:<netmask>:<hostname>::none nameserver=<dns> \
rd.znet=qeth,0.0.bdf0,0.0.bdf1,0.0.bdf2,layer2=1,portno=0 \
zfcp.allow_lun_scan=0 \
rd.dasd=0.0.3490
----
+
Write all options in the parameter file as a single line and make sure that you have no newline characters.

** For installations on FCP-type disks, complete the following tasks:
... Use `rd.zfcp=<adapter>,<wwpn>,<lun>` to specify the FCP disk where {op-system} is to be installed. For multipathing, repeat this step for each additional path.
+
[NOTE]
====
When you install with multiple paths, you must enable multipathing directly after the installation, not at a later point in time, as this can cause problems.
====
... Set the install device as: `coreos.inst.install_dev=/dev/sda`.
+
[NOTE]
====
If additional LUNs are configured with NPIV, FCP requires `zfcp.allow_lun_scan=0`. If you must enable `zfcp.allow_lun_scan=1` because you use a CSI driver, for example, you must configure your NPIV so that each node cannot access the boot partition of another node.
====
... You can adjust further parameters if required.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Additional postinstallation steps are required to fully enable multipathing. For more information, see “Enabling multipathing with kernel arguments on {op-system}" in _Postinstallation machine configuration tasks_.
====
// Add xref once it's allowed.
+
The following is an example parameter file, `additional-worker-fcp.parm` for a worker node with multipathing:
+
[source,terminal]
----
rd.neednet=1 \
console=ttysclp0 \
coreos.inst.install_dev=/dev/sda \

coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://<http_server>/worker.ign \

rd.znet=qeth,0.0.bdf0,0.0.bdf1,0.0.bdf2,layer2=1,portno=0 \
zfcp.allow_lun_scan=0 \
rd.zfcp=0.0.1987,0x50050763070bc5e3,0x4008400B00000000 \

. Transfer the `initramfs`, `kernel`, parameter files, and {op-system} images to z/VM, for example, by using FTP. For details about how to transfer the files with FTP and boot from the virtual reader, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/installation_guide/sect-installing-zvm-s390[Installing under Z/VM].
. Punch the files to the virtual reader of the z/VM guest virtual machine.
+
See link:https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zvm/latest?topic=commands-punch[PUNCH] in {ibm-name} Documentation.
+
[TIP]
====
You can use the CP PUNCH command or, if you use Linux, the **vmur** command to transfer files between two z/VM guest virtual machines.
====
+
. Log in to CMS on the bootstrap machine.
. IPL the bootstrap machine from the reader by running the following command:
