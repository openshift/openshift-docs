= Setting policy rules

[role="_abstract"] 

With policy as code, {product-title-short} supports both internal and external sources for policies. When using external policies, {product-title-short} defines a Kubernetes native Custom Resource (CR) to streamline policy as code by using tools like {pipelines-shortname} and Argo CD. 

You can use {product-title-short} to perform the following actions:

* Define policy rules: Whether teams manage their policies as code or by using the {product-title-short} internal database, authoring policies can be technically challenging. {product-title-short} provides an intuitive user interface, or portal, that simplifies this task. You can focus on controls while hiding the specification complexity. You can author policies by using the portal and then exported them as YAML to be stored as code or be stored locally.
* Choose the lifecycle to which the policy applies: For internal policies, {product-title-short} offers Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) actions. For external policies, these actions are handled by users on their own, and the results are presented to {product-title-short} using the CR. For internal policies, {product-title-short} also offers role-based access control and tracks changes to policies in its audit log. 
* Configure policy behavior: {product-title-short} provides users with multi-cluster governance in a centralized manner. When configuring policies, you can configure the following:
** Select the scope for inclusion or exclusion for individual clusters, or establish governance to apply to all clusters
** Choose the action (inform/enforce), and enable or disable the policy 
** Configure notifiers 
* Test policies: 
** You can perform a dry run to test the policy in the portal or by using the API, and perform policy CR validation
** Create policy reports: You can configure reporting in the portal or by using the API to detail policy coverage
