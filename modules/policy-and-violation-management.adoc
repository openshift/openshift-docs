= Policy and violation management

[role="_abstract"] 

_Policy management_ encompasses the set of activities that security teams undertake to establish the appropriate guardrails. All of these activities happen *before* the policy is evaluated. _Violation management_ is the set of activities that security and developer teams take to assist in addressing security incidents to remediate policy violations.
All of these activities happen after a policy has been violated.
