= Configuring BIOS for distributed unit bare-metal hosts

Distributed unit (DU) hosts require the BIOS to be configured before the host can be provisioned. The BIOS configuration is dependent on the specific hardware that runs your DUs and the particular requirements of your installation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In this Developer Preview release, configuration and tuning of BIOS for DU bare-metal host machines is the responsibility of the customer. Automatic setting of BIOS is not handled by the zero touch provisioning workflow.
====

.Procedure

. Set the *UEFI/BIOS Boot Mode* to `UEFI`.
. In the host boot sequence order, set *Hard drive first*.
. Apply the specific BIOS configuration for your hardware. The following table describes a representative BIOS configuration for an Intel Xeon Skylake or Intel Cascade Lake server, based on the Intel FlexRAN 4G and 5G baseband PHY reference design.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The exact BIOS configuration depends on your specific hardware and network requirements. The following sample configuration is for illustrative purposes only.
