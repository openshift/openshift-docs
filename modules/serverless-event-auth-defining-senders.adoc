= Defining authorized senders in an EventPolicy

The `.spec.from` section specifies the entities allowed to send events to the resources listed in `.spec.to.` This section can reference specific event sources or subjects service accounts, and it supports wildcard matching for broader coverage. There are two main ways to define senders.

[id="serverless-event-auth-event-source-by-name_{context}"]
== Event source by name

The `from.ref` method directly references an event source resource. For example, referencing a `PingSource` in a different namespace ensures that only that specific source can deliver events to the defined targets.

.Example of `from.ref` method
[source,yaml]
----
from:
  - ref:
      apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1
      kind: PingSource
      name: my-source
      namespace: another-namespace
----

[id="serverless-event-auth-subject-based-authorization_{context}"]
== Subject based authorization

The `from.sub` method specifies subjects, such as service accounts, that are allowed to send events. Wildcard patterns with `*` are used to authorize multiple accounts matching a pattern. For example, an EventPolicy may authorize a single trusted service account and also allow all accounts beginning with `other-` in the same namespace.

.Example of `from.sub` method
[source,yaml]
----
from:
  - sub: system:serviceaccount:default:trusted-app
  - sub: "system:serviceaccount:default:other-*"
