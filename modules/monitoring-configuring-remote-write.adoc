= Configuring remote write storage

You can configure remote write storage to enable Prometheus to send ingested metrics to remote systems for long-term storage. 
Doing so has no impact on how or for how long Prometheus stores metrics.

.Prerequisites

* *If you are configuring core {product-title} monitoring components:*
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
** You have created the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* *If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects:*
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role or as a user with the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.
** You have created the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have set up a remote write compatible endpoint (such as Thanos) and know the endpoint URL.
See the link:https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#remote-endpoints-and-storage[Prometheus remote endpoints and storage documentation] for information about endpoints that are compatible with the remote write feature.
* You have set up authentication credentials for the remote write endpoint. 
+
[CAUTION]
====
To reduce security risks, avoid sending metrics to an endpoint via unencrypted HTTP or without using authentication.

.Procedure

. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

. Add a `remoteWrite:` section under `data/config.yaml/prometheusK8s`.

. Add an endpoint URL and authentication credentials in this section:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write.endpoint"
        <endpoint_authentication_credentials>
----
+
For `endpoint_authentication_credentials` substitute the credentials for the endpoint.
Currently supported authentication methods are basic authentication (`basicAuth`) and client TLS (`tlsConfig`) authentication.
+
* The following example configures basic authentication:
+
[source,yaml]
----
basicAuth:
  username:
    <usernameSecret>
  password:
    <passwordSecret>
----
Substitute `<usernameSecret>` and `<passwordSecret>` accordingly. 
+
The following sample shows basic authentication configured with `remoteWriteAuth` for the `name` values and `user` and `password` for the `key` values. These values contain the endpoint authentication credentials:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write.endpoint"
        basicAuth:
          username:
            name: remoteWriteAuth
            key: user
          password:
            name: remoteWriteAuth
            key: password
----
+
* The following example configures client TLS authentication:
+
[source,yaml]
----
tlsConfig:
  ca:
    <caSecret>
  cert:
    <certSecret>
  keySecret:
    <keySecret>
----
Substitute `<caSecret>`, `<certSecret>`, and `<keySecret>` accordingly. 
+
The following sample shows a TLS authentication configuration using `selfsigned-mtls-bundle` for the `name` values and `ca.crt` for the `ca` `key` value, `client.crt` for the `cert` `key` value, and `client.key` for the `keySecret` `key` value:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write.endpoint"
      tlsConfig:
        ca:
          secret:
            name: selfsigned-mtls-bundle
            key: ca.crt
        cert:
          secret:
            name: selfsigned-mtls-bundle
            key: client.crt
        keySecret:
          name: selfsigned-mtls-bundle
          key: client.key
----

. Add write relabel configuration values after the authentication credentials:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write.endpoint"
        <endpoint_authentication_credentials>
        <write_relabel_configs>
----
+
For `<write_relabel_configs>` substitute a list of write relabel configurations for metrics that you want to send to the remote endpoint.
+
The following sample shows how to forward a single metric called `my_metric`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write.endpoint"
        writeRelabelConfigs:
        - source_labels: [__name__]
          regex: 'my_metric'
          action: keep

----
+
See the link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config[Prometheus relabel_config documentation] for information about write relabel configuration options.

. If required, configure remote write for the Prometheus instance that monitors user-defined projects by changing the `name` and `namespace` `metadata` values as follows:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write.endpoint"
        <endpoint_authentication_credentials>
        <write_relabel_configs>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The Prometheus config map component is called `prometheusK8s` in the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object and `prometheus` in the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
====

. Save the file to apply the changes to the `ConfigMap` object.
The pods affected by the new configuration restart automatically.
+
[NOTE]
====
Configurations applied to the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object are not activated unless a cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
====
+
[WARNING]
====
Saving changes to a monitoring `ConfigMap` object might redeploy the pods and other resources in the related project. Saving changes might also restart the running monitoring processes in that project.
