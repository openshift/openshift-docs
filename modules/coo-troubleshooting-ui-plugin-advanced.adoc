= Advanced controls for the {coo-full} troubleshooting panel UI plugin

The **Advanced** button opens additional controls over the correlation search.
These are *experimental* and might change in a future release.
They provide access to additional features of the {korrel8r} upstream project that powers the correlation search.

The following list explains the additional controls under the *Advanced* button:

* **Recent** The search is limited to recent results, by default in the last day.
* **Range** Allows searching an explicit date/time range in the past.
* **Distance** Searches up to the given distance from the starting point.
    Each correlation rule (edge in the graph) is a "step", and the **distance** is the maximum number of steps.
* **Goal Class** Instead of a distance, you can select a **goal**, which is a resource or signal type.
    This searches for paths from the start to the goal type, and the path length is not limited.
    For more information about correlation classes, see the {korrel8r} project documentation.
* **Query** The {korrel8r} query representing the starting point for the search.
    Click **Focus** to reset the query to reflect the current console page.
    Click **Sync** to re-run the current query and update the graph.
    For more information about correlation queries, see the {korrel8r} project documentation.
