= Validation checks before agent ISO creation

The Agent-based Installer performs validation checks on user defined YAML files before the ISO is created. Once the validations are successful, the agent ISO
is created.

.`install-config.yaml`

* `baremetal`, `vsphere` and `none` platforms are supported.
* If `none` is used as a platform, the number of control plane replicas must be `1` and the total number of worker replicas must be `0`.
* The `networkType` parameter must be `OVNKubernetes` in the case of `none` platform.
* `apiVIPs` and `ingressVIPs` parameters must be set for bare metal and vSphere platforms.
* Some host-specific fields in the bare metal platform configuration that have equivalents in `agent-config.yaml` file are ignored. A warning message is logged if these fields are set.


.`agent-config.yaml`

* Each interface must have a defined MAC address. Additionally, all interfaces must have a different MAC address.
* At least one interface must be defined for each host.
* World Wide Name (WWN) vendor extensions are not supported in root device hints.
* The `role` parameter in the `host` object must have a value of either `master` or `worker`.

== ZTP manifests

.`agent-cluster-install.yaml`

* For IPv6, the only supported value for the `networkType` parameter is `OVNKubernetes`. The `OpenshiftSDN` value can be used only for IPv4.

.`cluster-image-set.yaml`

* The `ReleaseImage` parameter must match the release defined in the installer.
