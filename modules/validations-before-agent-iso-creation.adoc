= Validation checks before agent.iso creation

The Agent-based Installer performs validation checks on user defined YAML files before the ISO is created. Once the validations are successful, the `agent.iso`
is created.

.`install-config.yaml`

* `baremetal`, `vsphere` and `none` platforms are supported.
* If `none` is used as a platform, the number of control planes must be `1` and the total number of worker replicas must be `0`.
* `apiVIPs` and `ingressVIPs` parameters must be set for bare metal and vSphere platforms respectively.
* The `networkType` parameter must have a `OvNKubernetes` value.

.`agent-config.yaml`

* Each interface must have a defined MAC address. Additionally, all interfaces must have a different MAC address.
* At least one interface must be defined for each host.
* World Wide Name(WWN) extensions are not supported in root device hints.
* (WWN) vendor extensions are not supported in root device hints.
* The `role` parameter in the `host` object must have a value of either `master` or `worker`.

== ZTP manifests

.`agent-cluster-install.yaml`

* For IPv6, the supported value is `OVNKubernetes` for the `networkType` parameter . The `OpenshiftSDN` value is used only for IPv4.

.`cluster-image-set.yaml`

* The `ReleaseImage` parameter must match the release defined in the image.
