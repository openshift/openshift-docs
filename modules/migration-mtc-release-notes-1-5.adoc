== New features and enhancements

This release has the following new features and enhancements:

* The *Migration resource* tree on the *Migration details* page of the web console has been enhanced with additional resources, Kubernetes events, and live status information for monitoring and debugging migrations.
* The web console can support hundreds of migration plans.
* A source namespace can be mapped to a different target namespace in a migration plan. Previously, the source namespace was mapped to a target namespace with the same name.
* Hook phases with status information are displayed in the web console during a migration.
* The number of Rsync retry attempts is displayed in the web console during direct volume migration.
* Persistent volume (PV) resizing can be enabled during direct volume migration to ensure that the target cluster does not run out of disk space.
* The threshold that triggers PV resizing is configurable. Previously, PV resizing occurred when the disk usage exceeded 97%.
* Velero has been updated to version 1.6, which provides numerous fixes and enhancements.
* A cached Kubernetes client can be enabled to provide improved performance.

[id="known-issues-1-5_{context}"]
== Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

* PV resizing does not work as expected for AWS gp2 storage unless the `pv_resizing_threshold` is 42% or greater. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1973148[*BZ#1973148*])
* If a migration fails, the migration plan does not retain custom PV settings for quiesced pods. You must manually roll back the migration, delete the migration plan, and create a new migration plan with your PV settings. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1784899[*BZ#1784899*])
