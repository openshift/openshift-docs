= {mtc-full} 1.5 release notes

The release notes for {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) version 1.5 describe new features, enhancements, and known issues.

[id="new-features-and-enhancements-1-5_{context}"]
== New features and enhancements

This release has the following new features and enhancements:

* The *Migration resource* tree on the *Migration details* page of the web console has been enhanced with additional resources, Kubernetes events, and live status information for monitoring and debugging migrations.
* The web console can support hundreds of migration plans.
* A source namespace can be mapped to a different target namespace in a migration plan. Previously, the source namespace was mapped to a target namespace with the same name.
* Hook phases with status information are displayed in the web console during a migration.
* The number of Rsync retry attempts is displayed in the web console during direct volume migration.
* Persistent volume (PV) resizing can be enabled for direct volume migration to ensure that the target cluster does not run out of disk space.
* The threshold that triggers PV resizing is configurable. Previously, PV resizing occurred when the disk usage exceeded 97%.
* Velero has been updated to version 1.6, which provides numerous fixes and enhancements.
* Cached Kubernetes clients can be enabled to provide improved performance.

[id="deprecated-features-1-5_{context}"]
== Deprecated features

The following features are deprecated:

// https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MIG-623
* {mtc-short} versions 1.2 and 1.3 are no longer supported.
* The procedure for updating deprecated APIs has been removed from the troubleshooting section of the documentation because the `oc convert` command is deprecated.

[id="known-issues-1-5_{context}"]
== Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

* PV resizing does not work as expected for AWS gp2 storage unless the `pv_resizing_threshold` is 42% or greater. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1973148[*BZ#1973148*])
* If a migration fails, the migration plan does not retain custom PV settings for quiesced pods. You must manually roll back the migration, delete the migration plan, and create a new migration plan with your PV settings. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1784899[*BZ#1784899*])
* Microsoft Azure storage is unavailable if you create more than 400 migration plans. The `MigStorage` custom resource displays the following message: `The request is being throttled as the limit has been reached for operation type`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1977226[*BZ#1977226*])
* On {product-title} 3.10, the `MigrationController` pod takes too long to restart. The bug report contains a workaround. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1986796[*BZ#1986796*])
