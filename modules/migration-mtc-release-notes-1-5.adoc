== New features and enhancements

This release has the following new features and enhancements:

* The *Migration resource* tree on the *Migration details* page of the web console has been enhanced with additional resources, Kubernetes events, and live status information for monitoring and debugging migrations.
* The web console can support hundreds of migration plans.
* A source namespace can be mapped to a different target namespace in a migration plan. Previously, the source namespace was mapped to a target namespace with the same name.
* Hook phases with status information are displayed in the web console during a migration.
* The number of Rsync retry attempts is displayed in the web console during direct volume migration.
* Persistent volume (PV) resizing can be enabled for direct volume migration to ensure that the target cluster does not run out of disk space.
* The threshold that triggers PV resizing is configurable. Previously, PV resizing occurred when the disk usage exceeded 97%.
* Velero has been updated to version 1.6, which provides numerous fixes and enhancements.
* Cached Kubernetes clients can be enabled to provide improved performance.

[id="deprecated-features-1-5_{context}"]
== Deprecated features

The following features are deprecated:

// https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MIG-623
* {mtc-short} versions 1.2 and 1.3 are no longer supported.
* The procedure for updating deprecated APIs has been removed from the troubleshooting section of the documentation because the `oc convert` command is deprecated.

[id="known-issues-1-5_{context}"]
== Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

* Microsoft Azure storage is unavailable if you create more than 400 migration plans. The `MigStorage` custom resource displays the following message: `The request is being throttled as the limit has been reached for operation type`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1977226[*BZ#1977226*])
* If a migration fails, the migration plan does not retain custom persistent volume (PV) settings for quiesced pods. You must manually roll back the migration, delete the migration plan, and create a new migration plan with your PV settings. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1784899[*BZ#1784899*])
* PV resizing does not work as expected for AWS gp2 storage unless the `pv_resizing_threshold` is 42% or greater. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1973148[*BZ#1973148*])
* PV resizing does not work with {product-title} 3.7 and 3.9 source clusters in the following scenarios:

** The application was installed after MTC was installed.
** An application pod was rescheduled on a different node after MTC was installed.
+
{product-title} 3.7 and 3.9 do not support the Mount Propagation feature that enables Velero to mount PVs automatically in the `Restic` pod. The `MigAnalytic` custom resource (CR) fails to collect PV data from the `Restic` pod and reports the resources as `0`. The `MigPlan` CR displays a status similar to the following:
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]

    reason: FailedRunningDf
    status: "True"
    type: ExtendedPVAnalysisFailed

+
To enable PV resizing, you can manually restart the Restic daemonset on the source cluster or restart the `Restic` pods on the same nodes as the application. If you do not restart Restic, you can run the direct volume migration without PV resizing. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1982729[*BZ#1982729*])

[id="technical-changes-1-5_{context}"]
== Technical changes

This release has the following technical changes:

* The legacy {mtc-full} Operator version 1.5.1 is installed manually on {product-title} versions 3.7 to 4.5.
* The {mtc-full} Operator version 1.5.1 is installed on {product-title} versions 4.6 and later by using the Operator Lifecycle Manager.
