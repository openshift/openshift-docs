= Completing an Azure installation on user-provisioned infrastructure

After you start the {product-title} installation on Microsoft Azure
user-provisioned infrastructure, you can monitor the cluster events until the
cluster is ready.

.Prerequisites

* Deploy the bootstrap machine for an {product-title} cluster on user-provisioned Azure infrastructure.
* Install the `oc` CLI and log in.

.Procedure

* Complete the cluster installation:
+
----
$ ./openshift-install --dir=<installation_directory> wait-for install-complete <1>

INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for the cluster to initialize...
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the path to the directory that you
stored the installation files in.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours. You must keep the cluster running for 24 hours in a non-degraded state to ensure that the first certificate rotation has finished.
