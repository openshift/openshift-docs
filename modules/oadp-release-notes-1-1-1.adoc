= OADP 1.1.1 release notes

The OADP 1.1.1 release notes include product recommendations and descriptions of known issues.

== Product recommendations

Before you install OADP 1.1.1, it is recommended to either install VolSync 0.5.1 or to upgrade to it.

== Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

* Multiple HTTP/2 enabled web servers are vulnerable to a DDoS attack (Rapid Reset Attack)
+
The HTTP/2 protocol is susceptible to a denial of service attack because request cancellation can reset multiple streams quickly. The server has to set up and tear down the streams while not hitting any server-side limit for the maximum number of active streams per connection. This results in a denial of service due to server resource consumption. For a list of all OADP issues associated with this CVE, see the following link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-2868?filter=12421248[Jira list].
+
It is advised to upgrade to OADP 1.1.7 or 1.2.3, which resolve this issue.
+

+


* OADP currently does not support backup and restore of AWS EFS volumes using restic in Velero (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-778[*OADP-778*]).

* CSI backups might fail due to a Ceph limitation of `VolumeSnapshotContent` snapshots per PVC.
+
You can create many snapshots of the same persistent volume claim (PVC) but cannot schedule periodic creation of snapshots:
+
** For CephFS, you can create up to 100 snapshots per PVC.
** For RADOS Block Device (RBD), you can create up to 512 snapshots for each PVC. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-804[*OADP-804*]) and (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-975[*OADP-975*])
