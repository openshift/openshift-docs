= 3scale Adapter metrics
The adapter, by default reports various Prometheus metrics that are exposed on port `8080` at the `/metrics` endpoint. These metrics provide insight into how the interactions between the adapter and 3scale are performing. The service is labeled to be automatically discovered and scraped by Prometheus.

NOTE: There are incompatible changes in the 3scale Istio Adapter metrics since the previous releases in Service Mesh 1.x.

In Prometheus, metrics have been renamed with one addition for the backend cache, so that the following metrics exist as of Service Mesh 2.0:
