= Understanding vulnerability scores in the dashboard

[role="_abstract"]
The vulnerability management dashboard in the {product-title} portal shows a single Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score for each vulnerability.
{product-title-short} shows the CVSS score based on the following criteria:

* If a CVSS v3 score is available, {product-title-short} shows the score and lists `v3` along with it.
For example, `6.5 (v3)`.
+
[NOTE]
====
CVSS v3 scores are only available if you are using the StackRox Scanner version 1.3.5 and later or Scanner V4.
====

* If a CVSS v3 score is not available, {product-title-short} might show only the CVSS v2 score.
For example, `6.5`.

You can use the API to get the CVSS scores.
If CVSS v3 information is available for a vulnerability, the response might include both CVSS v3 and CVSS v2 information.

For a Red{nbsp}Hat Security Advisory (RHSA), the CVSS score is set to the highest CVSS score among all the related CVEs. One RHSA can contain multiple CVEs, and Red{nbsp}Hat sometimes assigns a different score based on how a vulnerability affects other Red{nbsp}Hat products.
