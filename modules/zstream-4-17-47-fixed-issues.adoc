The following issues are fixed with this release:

* Before this release, pods on the same node could not reach a pod's secondary `Localnet` interface on a `br-ex` bridge, so the pod defaulted to the primary network. With this release, communication between a `Localnet` pod and a pod running on the same node is possible, if the `Localnet` network's IP addresses are on the same subnet as the host network. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-59381[OCPBUGS-59381])

* Before this update, bonded network configurations with `mode=active-backup` and `fail_over_mac=follow` failed due to a race condition, causing interfaces to be activated multiple times and leading to unpredictable states and identical MAC addresses. As a consequence, these configurations flapped, causing high availability issues. With this release, the bonded network configuration issue is fixed by modifying `configure-ovs.sh` to check for both `activating` and `active` states. As a result, bonded network configurations with `active-backup` mode and `fail_over_mac=follow` does not flap, ensuring high availability.

* Before this update, Prometheus `Remote-Write` caused alerts due to dropped samples in relabeling configuration. As a consequence, the Prometheus `Remote-Write Behind` alert was active. With this release, the `Remote-Write` issue is resolved, and dropped samples do not trigger the alert. As a result, the Prometheus `Remote-Write Behind` alert does not become active when samples are dropped due to relabeling configuration. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-61766[OCPBUGS-61766])

* Before this update, `NMState` service failed due to a dependency issue with `NetworkManager-wait-online` in bare metal deployments. As a consequence, the `NMState` service failed in {product-title} deployments, causing `br-ex` configuration issues and deployment failures. With this release, the `NetworkManager-wait-online` dependency issue is resolved, and ensures that the `NMState` service does not fail in {product-title} deployments, and network configuration is applied correctly.
