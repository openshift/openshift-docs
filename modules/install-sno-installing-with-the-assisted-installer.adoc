= Installing {sno} with the Assisted Installer

Use the Assisted Installer to install the single-node cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Ensure that the boot drive order in the server BIOS settings defaults to booting the server from the target installation disk.

.Procedure

. Attach the discovery ISO image to the target host.

. Boot the server from the discovery ISO image. The discovery ISO image writes the system configuration to the target installation disk and automatically triggers a server restart.

. On the administration host, return to the browser. Wait for the host to appear in the list of discovered hosts. If necessary, reload the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/assisted-installer/clusters[*Assisted Clusters*] page and select the cluster name.

. Complete the install wizard steps. Add networking details, including a subnet from the available subnets. Add the SSH public key if necessary.

. Monitor the installation's progress. Watch the cluster events. After the installation process finishes writing the operating system image to the server's hard disk, the server restarts.

. Optional: Remove the discovery ISO image.
+
The server restarts several times automatically, deploying the control plane.
