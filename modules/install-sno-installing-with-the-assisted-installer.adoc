.Procedure

. Attach the {op-system} discovery ISO to the target host.

. Configure the boot drive order in the server BIOS settings to boot from the attached discovery ISO and then reboot the server.

. On the administration host, return to the browser. Wait for the host to appear in the list of discovered hosts. If necessary, reload the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/assisted-installer/clusters[*Assisted Clusters*] page and select the cluster name.

. Complete the install wizard steps. Add networking details, including a subnet from the available subnets. Add the SSH public key if necessary.

. Monitor the installation's progress. Watch the cluster events. After the installation process finishes writing the operating system image to the server's hard disk, the server restarts.

. Remove the discovery ISO, and reset the server to boot from the installation drive.

The server restarts several times automatically, deploying the control plane.
