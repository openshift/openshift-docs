= Enabling the manual approval gate controller

To use manual approval tasks, you must first enable the manual approval gate controller.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the {pipelines-title} Operator in your cluster.
* You are logged on to the cluster using the `oc` command-line utility.
* You have administrator permissions for the `openshift-pipelines` namespace.

.Procedure

. Create a file named `manual-approval-gate-cr.yaml` with the following manifest for the `ManualApprovalGate` custom resource (CR):
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ManualApprovalGate
metadata:
  name: manual-approval-gate
spec:
  targetNamespace: openshift-pipelines
----

. Apply the `ManualApprovalGate` CR by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f manual-approval-gate-cr.yaml
----

. Verify that the manual approval gate controller is running by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get manualapprovalgates.operator.tekton.dev
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                   VERSION    READY   REASON
manual-approval-gate   v0.1.0	    True
----
+
Ensure that the `READY` status is `True`. If it is not `True`, wait for a few minutes and enter the command again. The controller might take some time to reach a ready state.
