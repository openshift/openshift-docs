= Reviewing component state

[role="_abstract"]
To understand if you are using a software package in deployment, as you assess if you want to remove the package, you can view the {product-title} inferred state of the component.

The states are:
* *Active*: A software component is actively used by a process in the application.
* *Inactive*: A software component is not used by a process in the application.
* *Undetermined*: {product-title} can not determine if the component is in use.

.Procedure
. On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Vulnerability Management* -> *Dashboard*.
. On the *Dashboard* view header, select *Application & Infrastructure* -> *Deployments*.
. From the list, search for and select the *Deployement* you want to review.
. Selecte *Images* from *Related entities* on the right.
. From the list of images, click *Components* under the *Components* column.
. Review the components state as inactive, active or undetermined under the *Active* coluomn.
