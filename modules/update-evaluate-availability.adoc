= Evaluation of update availability

The Cluster Version Operator (CVO) periodically queries the OpenShift Update Service (OSUS) for the most recent data about update possibilities.
This data is based on the cluster's subscribed channel.
The CVO then saves information about update recommendations into either the `availableUpdates` or `conditionalUpdates` field of its `ClusterVersion` resource.

The CVO periodically checks the conditional updates for update risks.
These risks are conveyed through the data served by the OSUS, which contains information for each version about known issues that might affect a cluster updated to that version.
Most risks are limited to clusters with specific characteristics, such as clusters with a certain size or clusters that are deployed in a particular cloud platform.

The CVO continuously evaluates its cluster characteristics against the conditional risk information for each conditional update. If the CVO finds that the cluster matches the criteria, the CVO stores this information in the `conditionalUpdates` field of its `ClusterVersion` resource.
If the CVO finds that the cluster does not match the risks of an update, or that there are no risks associated with the update, it stores the target version in the `availableUpdates` field of its `ClusterVersion` resource.

The user interface, either the web console or the OpenShift CLI (`oc`), presents this information in sectioned headings to the administrator.
Each *supported but not recommended* update recommendation contains a link to further resources about the risk so that the administrator can make an informed decision about the update.

You can inspect all available updates with the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade --include-not-recommended
----

The additional `--include-not-recommended` parameter includes updates that are available but not recommended due to a known risk that applies to the cluster.

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Cluster version is 4.10.22

Upstream is unset, so the cluster will use an appropriate default.
Channel: fast-4.11 (available channels: candidate-4.10, candidate-4.11, eus-4.10, fast-4.10, fast-4.11, stable-4.10)

Recommended updates:

Supported but not recommended updates:

  Version: 4.11.0
  Image: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@sha256:300bce8246cf880e792e106607925de0a404484637627edf5f517375517d54a4

One way to inspect the underlying availability data created by the CVO is by querying the `ClusterVersion` resource with the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusterversion version -o json | jq '.status.availableUpdates'
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
[
  {
    "channels": [
      "candidate-4.11",
      "candidate-4.12",
      "fast-4.11",
      "fast-4.12"
    ],
    "image": "quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@sha256:400267c7f4e61c6bfa0a59571467e8bd85c9188e442cbd820cc8263809be3775",
    "url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2023:3213",
    "version": "4.11.41"
  },
  ...
]

A similar command can be used to check conditional updates:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get clusterversion version -o json | jq '.status.conditionalUpdates'
----
