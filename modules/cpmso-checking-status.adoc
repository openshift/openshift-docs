[id="cpmso-checking-status_{context}"]
= Checking the control plane machine set custom resource state

You can verify the existence and state of the `ControlPlaneMachineSet` custom resource (CR).

.Procedure

* Determine the state of the CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get controlplanemachineset.machine.openshift.io cluster \
  --namespace openshift-machine-api
----

** A result of `Active` indicates that the `ControlPlaneMachineSet` CR exists and is activated. No administrator action is required.

** A result of `Inactive` indicates that a `ControlPlaneMachineSet` CR exists but is not activated.

** A result of `NotFound` indicates that there is no existing `ControlPlaneMachineSet` CR.

ifndef::cpmso-disabling[]
.Next steps

To use the control plane machine set, you must ensure that a `ControlPlaneMachineSet` CR with the correct settings for your cluster exists.

* If your cluster has an existing CR, you must verify that the configuration in the CR is correct for your cluster.

* If your cluster does not have an existing CR, you must create one with the correct configuration for your cluster.
