= Pruning builds

In order to prune builds that are no longer required by the system due to age
and status, administrators can run the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm prune builds [<options>]
----

.Prune builds CLI configuration options
[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===

|Option |Description

.^|`--confirm`
|Indicate that pruning should occur, instead of performing a dry-run.

.^|`--orphans`
|Prune all builds whose Build Configuration no longer exists, status is complete,
failed, error, or canceled.

.^|`--keep-complete=<N>`
|Per Build Configuration, keep the last `N` builds whose status is complete (default
`5`).

.^|`--keep-failed=<N>`
|Per Build Configuration, keep the last `N` builds whose status is failed, error, or
canceled (default `1`).

.^|`--keep-younger-than=<duration>`
|Do not prune any object that is younger than `<duration>` relative to the
current time (default `60m`).
|===

To see what a pruning operation would delete:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm prune builds --orphans --keep-complete=5 --keep-failed=1 \
    --keep-younger-than=60m
----

To actually perform the prune operation:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm prune builds --orphans --keep-complete=5 --keep-failed=1 \
    --keep-younger-than=60m --confirm
----

[NOTE]
====
Developers can enable automatic build pruning by modifying their Build
Configuration.
