= Traffic routing examples

When you create a Knative service, it does not have any default `traffic` spec settings. By setting the `traffic` spec, you can split traffic over any number of fixed revisions, or send traffic to the latest revision.

[id="serverless-traffic-routing-examples-multiple-revisions_{context}"]
== Traffic routing between multiple revisions

The following example shows how the list of revisions in the `traffic` spec can be extended so that traffic is split between multiple revisions.

This example sends 50% of traffic to the revision tagged as `current`, and 50% of traffic to the revision tagged as `candidate`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: example-service
  namespace: default
spec:
...
  traffic:
  - tag: current
    revisionName: example-service-1
    percent: 50
  - tag: candidate
    revisionName: example-service-2
    percent: 50
  - tag: latest
    latestRevision: true
    percent: 0

[id="serverless-traffic-routing-examples-latest-revision_{context}"]
== Traffic routing to the latest revision

The following example shows a `traffic` spec where 100% of traffic is routed to the latest revision of the service. Under `status`, you can see the name of the latest revision that `latestRevision` resolves to:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: example-service
  namespace: default
spec:
...
  traffic:
  - latestRevision: true
    percent: 100
status:
  ...
  traffic:
  - percent: 100
    revisionName: example-service
----

[id="serverless-traffic-routing-examples-current-revision_{context}"]
== Traffic routing to the current revision

The following example shows a `traffic` spec where 100% of traffic is routed to the revision tagged as `current`, and the name of that revision is specified as `example-service`. The revision tagged as `latest` is kept available, even though no traffic is routed to it:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: example-service
  namespace: default
spec:
...
  traffic:
  - tag: current
    revisionName: example-service
    percent: 100
  - tag: latest
    latestRevision: true
    percent: 0
