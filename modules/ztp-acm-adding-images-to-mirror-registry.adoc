= Adding {op-system} ISO and RootFS images to a disconnected mirror host

Before you install a cluster on infrastructure that you provision, you must create {op-system-first} machines for it to use. Use a disconnected mirror to host the {op-system} images you require to provision your distributed unit (DU) bare-metal hosts.

.Prerequisites

* Deploy and configure an HTTP server to host the {op-system} image resources on the network. You must be able to access the HTTP server from your computer, and from the machines that you create.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {op-system} images might not change with every release of {product-title}. You must download images with the highest version that is less than or equal to the {product-title} version that you install. Use the image versions that match your {product-title} version if they are available. You require ISO and RootFS images to install {op-system} on the DU hosts. {op-system} qcow2 images are not supported for this installation type.
====

.Procedure

. Log in to the mirror host.
. Obtain the {op-system} ISO and RootFS images from link:https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/pre-release/[mirror.openshift.com], for example:

.. Export the required image names and {product-title} version as environment variables:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export ISO_IMAGE_NAME=<iso_image_name> <1>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export ROOTFS_IMAGE_NAME=<rootfs_image_name> <2>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export OCP_VERSION=<ocp_version> <3>
----
<1> ISO image name, for example, `rhcos-4.9.0-fc.1-x86_64-live.x86_64.iso`
<2> RootFS image name, for example, `rhcos-4.9.0-fc.1-x86_64-live-rootfs.x86_64.img`
<3> {product-title} version, for example, `latest-4.9`

.. Download the required images:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo wget https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/pre-release/${OCP_VERSION}/${ISO_IMAGE_NAME} -O /var/www/html/${ISO_IMAGE_NAME}
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo wget https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/pre-release/${OCP_VERSION}/${ROOTFS_IMAGE_NAME} -O /var/www/html/${ROOTFS_IMAGE_NAME}
----

.Verification steps

* Verify that the images downloaded successfully and are being served on the disconnected mirror host, for example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ wget http://$(hostname)/${ISO_IMAGE_NAME}
----
+
.Expected output
+
[source,terminal]
----
