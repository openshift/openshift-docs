= Using signing with Kernel Module Management (KMM)

On a Secure Boot enabled system, all kernel modules (kmods) must be signed with a public/private key-pair
enrolled into the Machine Owner's Key or MOK database. Drivers distributed as part of a distribution should already be signed by the distributions private key,
but for kernel modules build out-of-tree, KMM supports signing kernel modules using the `sign` section of the kernel mapping.

For more details on using Secure Boot see:

* link:https://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot[SecureBoot]

.Prerequisites

To use this functionality you need:

* A public private key pair in the correct (der) format.
* At least one secure-boot enabled node with the public key enrolled in its MOK database.
* Either a pre-built driver container image, or the source code and `Dockerfile` needed to build one in-cluster.

You can use either of these methods to sign modules:

* If you have a pre-built image, such as an image distributed by a hardware vendor or already built
elsewhere, see <<kmm-signing-a-prebuilt-driver-container,Signing a pre-built driver container>> for signing with KMM.

* If you have source code and need to build your image first, see 
<<kmm-building-and-signing-a-moduleloader-container-image,Building and signing a ModuleLoader container image>> for deploying with KMM.

If the build is successful, KMM loads your driver into the node's kernel.
If not, see <<kmm-debugging-and-troubleshooting,Debugging and troubleshooting>>.
