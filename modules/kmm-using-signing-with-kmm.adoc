= Using signing with Kernel Module Management (KMM)

On a Secure Boot enabled system, all kernel modules (kmods) must be signed with a public/private key-pair enrolled into the Machine Owner's Key (MOK) database. Drivers distributed as part of a distribution should already be signed by the distribution's private key, but for kernel modules build out-of-tree, KMM supports signing kernel modules using the `sign` section of the kernel mapping.

For more details on using Secure Boot, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/managing_monitoring_and_updating_the_kernel/signing-a-kernel-and-modules-for-secure-boot_managing-monitoring-and-updating-the-kernel#generating-a-public-and-private-key-pair_signing-a-kernel-and-modules-for-secure-boot[Generating a public and private key pair]

[id="kmm-using-signing-with-kmm-prerequisites_{context}"]
== Prerequisites

* A public private key pair in the correct (DER) format.
* At least one secure-boot enabled node with the public key enrolled in its MOK database.
* Either a pre-built driver container image, or the source code and Dockerfile needed to build one in-cluster.
