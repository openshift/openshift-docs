= About the {ai-full} and {oci} integration

You can run cluster workloads on {oci-first} infrastructure that supports dedicated, hybrid, public, and multiple cloud environments. Both Red{nbsp}Hat and Oracle test, validate, and support running {oci} in an {product-title} cluster on {oci}.

You can use the {ai-full} to install an {product-title} cluster on the {oci} platform, deploying cloud-native components such as {oci-ccm-full} and {oci-csi-full}, and integrating your cluster with {oci} API resources such as instance node, load balancer, and storage.

== Performance considerations

.Deployment platforms

The integration between OCP and {oci} is certified on both virtual machines (VMs) and bare metal (BM) machines. Bare metal installations using iSCSI boot drives require a secondary vNIC. 

Oracle provides the secondary vNICs via custom manifests. There are two separate custom manifests for bare metal nodes, one for compute nodes and one for control plane nodes.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is supported on all virtual machine shapes and the standard bare metal shapes listed at link:https://catalog.redhat.com/cloud/detail/216977[Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure].

.VPU sizing recommendations

To ensure the best performance conditions for your cluster workloads that operate on {oci}, ensure that volume performance units (VPUs) for your block volume are sized for your workloads. The following list provides guidance for selecting the VPUs needed for specific performance needs:

* Test or proof of concept environment: 100 GB, and 20 to 30 VPUs.
* Basic environment: 500 GB, and 60 VPUs.
* Heavy production environment: More than 500 GB, and 100 or more VPUs.

Consider reserving additional VPUs to provide sufficient capacity for updates and scaling activities. For more information about VPUs, see Volume Performance Units (Oracle documentation).

.Instance sizing recommendations

Find recommended values for compute instance CPU, memory, VPU, and volume size for OpenShift Container Platform nodes. For details, see link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/openshift-on-oci/installing-agent-about-instance-configurations.htm[Instance Sizing Recommendations for {product-title} on {oci} Nodes (Oracle documentation)].

== Workflow

The procedure for using the {ai-full} in a connected environment to install a cluster on {oci} is illustrated in the diagram below. 

image::684_OpenShift_Installing_on_OCI_0724_assisted.png[Image of a high-level workflow for using the Assisted Installer in a connected environment to install a cluster on {oci}]

An outline of the procedure is as follows:

. In the {oci} console, configure an OCI account to host the cluster, including:

.. Create a new child compartment under an existing compartment.

.. Create a new public DNS zone.

.. Create a new object storage bucket or use one provided by {oci}.

.. Download the stack file template stored locally. 

. In the {ai-full} console, set up a cluster:

.. Create the cluster.

.. Generate and download the discovery ISO image.

. In the {oci} console, create the infrastructure:

.. Upload the discovery ISO image to the {oci} bucket.

.. Create a Pre-Authenticated Request for the ISO image.

.. Upload the stack file template and use it to create the stack.

.. Update the manifests with the secret.

. In the {ai-full} console, complete the cluster installation:

.. Set roles for the cluster nodes.

.. Upload the manifests provided by Oracle.

.. Install the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The steps for provisioning {oci} resources are provided as an example only. You can also choose to create the required resources through other methods; the scripts are just an example. *I am not sure what this means exactly? By scripts here, do they mean the terraform* Installing a cluster with infrastructure that you provide requires knowledge of the cloud provider and the installation process on {product-title}. You can access {oci} Resource Manager configurations to complete these steps, or use the configurations to model your own custom script.
