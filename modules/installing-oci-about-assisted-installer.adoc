= The {ai-full} and {oci} overview

You can run cluster workloads on {oci-first} infrastructure that supports dedicated, hybrid, public, and multiple cloud environments. Both Red Hat and Oracle test, validate, and support running {oci} in an {product-title} cluster on {oci}.

The {ai-full} supports the {oci} platform, and you can use the {ai-full} to access an intuitive interactive workflow for the purposes of automating cluster installation tasks on {oci}.

:FeatureName: Using the {ai-full} to install an {product-title} cluster on OCI
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

{oci} provides services that can meet your needs for regulatory compliance, performance, and cost-effectiveness. You can access {oci} Resource Manager configurations to provision and configure {oci} resources.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The steps for provisioning {oci} resources are provided as an example only. You can also choose to create the required resources through other methods; the scripts are just an example. Installing a cluster with infrastructure that you provide requires knowledge of the cloud provider and the installation process on {product-title}. You can access {oci} Resource Manager configurations to complete these steps, or use the configurations to model your own custom script.
====

Follow the steps in the _Installing a cluster on {oci-first-no-rt} by using the Assisted Installer_ document to understand how to use the {ai-full} to install a {product-title} cluster on {oci}. This document demonstrates the use of the {oci} Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) and Oracle’s Container Storage Interface (CSI) objects to link your {product-title} cluster with the {oci} API.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To ensure the best performance conditions for your cluster workloads that operate on {oci}, ensure that volume performance units (VPUs) for your block volume are sized for your workloads. The following list provides guidance for selecting the VPUs needed for specific performance needs:

* Test or proof of concept environment: 100 GB, and 20 to 30 VPUs.
* Basic environment: 500 GB, and 60 VPUs.
* Heavy production environment: More than 500 GB, and 100 or more VPUs.

Consider reserving additional VPUs to provide sufficient capacity for updates and scaling activities. For more information about VPUs, see Volume Performance Units (Oracle documentation).
