After standing up the control plane, create compute machines.

.Prerequisites
* The `inventory.yaml` and `common.yaml` Ansible playbooks in a common directory
** If you need these files, copy them from *Creating network resources*
* The `metadata.yaml` file that the installation program created is in the same directory as the Ansible playbooks
* The control plane is active

.Procedure

. On a command line, change the working directory to the location of the `inventory.yaml` and `common.yaml` files.

. Insert the following content into a local file that is called `compute-nodes.yaml`:
