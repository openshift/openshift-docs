= Creating compute machines

After standing up the control plane, create compute machines.

.Prerequisites
* The `inventory.yaml` and `common.yaml` Ansible playbooks in a common directory
** If you need these files, copy them from *Creating network resources*
* The `metadata.yaml` file that the installation program created is in the same directory as the Ansible playbooks
* The control plane is active

.Procedure

. On a command line, change the working directory to the location of the `inventory.yaml`and `common.yaml` files.

. Insert the following content into a local file that is called `05_compute-nodes.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.6/upi/openstack/compute-nodes.yaml[]
----

. On a command line, run the playbook:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml 05_compute-nodes.yaml
----

.Next steps

* Approve the machines' certificate signing requests
