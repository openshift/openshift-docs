= Creating compute machines on {rh-openstack}

After standing up the control plane, create compute machines. Red Hat provides an Ansible playbook that you run to simplify this process.

.Prerequisites
* You downloaded the modules in "Downloading playbook dependencies".
* You downloaded the playbooks in "Downloading the installation playbooks".
* The `inventory.yaml`, `common.yaml`, and `compute-nodes.yaml` Ansible playbooks are in a common directory.
* The `metadata.json` file that the installation program created is in the same directory as the Ansible playbooks.
* The control plane is active.

.Procedure

. On a command line, change the working directory to the location of the playbooks.

. On a command line, run the playbook:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml compute-nodes.yaml
----

.Next steps

* Approve the certificate signing requests for the machines.
