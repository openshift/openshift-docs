= Capturing packets
You can capture packets using the Network Observability CLI. 

.Prerequisites
* Install the {oc-first}.
* Install the Network Observability CLI (`oc netobserv`) plugin.

.Procedure
. Run the packet capture with filters enabled:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc netobserv packets --filter=tcp,80
----
. Add filters to the `live table filter` prompt in the terminal to refine the incoming packets. An example filter is as follows:
+ 
[source,terminal]
----
live table filter: [SrcK8S_Zone:us-west-1b] press enter to match multiple regular expressions at once
----
. To stop capturing, press kbd:[Ctrl+C].
. View the captured data, which is written to a single file in an `./output/pcap` directory located in the same path that was used to install the CLI:
.. The `./output/pcap/<capture_date_time>.pcap` file can be opened with Wireshark.
