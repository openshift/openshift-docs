= GPUs and Red Hat Device Edge

Red Hat Device Edge provides access to MicroShift. MicroShift provides the simplicity of a single-node deployment with the functionality and services you need for resource-constrained (edge) computing. Red Hat Device Edge meets the needs of bare-metal, virtual, containerized, or Kubernetes workloads deployed in resource-constrained environments.

You can enable NVIDIA GPUs on containers in a Red Hat Device Edge environment.

You use GPU passthrough to access the containerized GPUs.
