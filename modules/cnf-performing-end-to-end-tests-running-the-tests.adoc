= Running the latency tests

Run the cluster latency tests to validate node tuning for your Cloud-native Network Functions (CNF) workload.

[NOTE]
====
When executing `podman` commands as a non-root or non-privileged user, mounting paths can fail with `permission denied` errors. Depending on your local operating system and SELinux configuration, you might also experience issues running these commands from your home directory. To make the `podman` commands work, run the commands from a folder that is not your home/<username> directory, and append `:Z` to the volumes creation. For example, `-v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z`. This allows `podman` to do the proper SELinux relabeling.
====

This procedure runs the three individual tests `hwlatdetect`, `cyclictest`, and `oslat`. For details on these individual tests, see their individual sections.

.Procedure

. Open a shell prompt in the directory containing the `kubeconfig` file.
+
You provide the test image with a `kubeconfig` file in current directory and its related `$KUBECONFIG` environment variable, mounted through a volume. This allows the running container to use the `kubeconfig` file from inside the container. 
+
[NOTE]
====
In the following command, your local `kubeconfig` is mounted to kubeconfig/kubeconfig in the cnf-tests container, which allows access to the cluster.
====
+
. To run the latency tests, run the following command, substituting variable values as appropriate:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
-e LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME=600\
-e MAXIMUM_LATENCY=20 \
registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel8:v{product-version} /usr/bin/test-run.sh \
--ginkgo.v --ginkgo.timeout="24h"
----
+
The LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME is shown in seconds, in this case 600 seconds (10 minutes). The test runs successfully when the maximum observed latency is lower than MAXIMUM_LATENCY (20 Î¼s).
+
If the results exceed the latency threshold, the test fails.
+
. Optional: Append `--ginkgo.dry-run` flag to run the latency tests in dry-run mode. This is useful for checking what commands the tests run.

. Optional: Append `--ginkgo.v` flag to run the tests with increased verbosity.

. Optional: Append `--ginkgo.timeout="24h"` flag to ensure the Ginkgo 2.0 test suite does not timeout before the latency tests complete.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
During testing shorter time periods, as shown, can be used to run the tests. However, for final verification and valid results, the test should run for at least 12 hours (43200 seconds).
