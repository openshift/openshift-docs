= Running the latency tests

Run the cluster latency tests to validate node tuning for your Cloud-native Network Functions (CNF) workload.

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Always** run the latency tests with `DISCOVERY_MODE=true` set. If you don't, the test suite will make changes to the running cluster configuration.
====

[NOTE]
====
When executing `podman` commands as a non-root or non-privileged user, mounting paths can fail with `permission denied` errors. To make the `podman` command work, append `:Z` to the volumes creation; for example, `-v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z`. This allows `podman` to do the proper SELinux relabeling.
====

.Procedure

. Open a shell prompt in the directory containing the `kubeconfig` file.
+
You provide the test image with a `kubeconfig` file in current directory and its related `$KUBECONFIG` environment variable, mounted through a volume. This allows the running container to use the `kubeconfig` file from inside the container.

. Run the latency tests by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
-e LATENCY_TEST_RUN=true -e DISCOVERY_MODE=true registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel8:v{product-version} \
/usr/bin/test-run.sh -ginkgo.focus="\[performance\]\ Latency\ Test"
----

. Optional: Append `-ginkgo.dryRun` to run the latency tests in dry-run mode. This is useful for checking what the tests run.

. Optional: Append `-ginkgo.v` to run the tests with increased verbosity.

. Optional: To run the latency tests against a specific performance profile, run the following command, substituting appropriate values:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
-e LATENCY_TEST_RUN=true -e LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME=600 -e MAXIMUM_LATENCY=20 \
-e PERF_TEST_PROFILE=<performance_profile> registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel8:v{product-version} \
/usr/bin/test-run.sh -ginkgo.focus="[performance]\ Latency\ Test"
----
+
where:
+
--
<performance_profile> :: Is the name of the performance profile you want to run the latency tests against.
--
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
For valid latency tests results, run the tests for at least 12 hours.
