= Running the latency tests

Run the cluster latency tests to validate node tuning for your Cloud-native Network Functions (CNF) workload.

[NOTE]
====
When executing `podman` commands as a non-root or non-privileged user, mounting paths can fail with `permission denied` errors. To make the `podman` command work, append `:Z` to the volumes creation; for example, `-v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z`. This allows `podman` to do the proper SELinux relabeling.
====

.Procedure

. Open a shell prompt in the directory containing the `kubeconfig` file.
+
You provide the test image with a `kubeconfig` file in current directory and its related `$KUBECONFIG` environment variable, mounted through a volume. This allows the running container to use the `kubeconfig` file from inside the container.

. Run the latency tests by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
-e LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME=<time_in_seconds>\
-e MAXIMUM_LATENCY=<time_in_microseconds> \
registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel8:v{product-version} /usr/bin/test-run.sh \
--ginkgo.v
----

. Optional: Append `--ginkgo.dryRun` flag to run the latency tests in dry-run mode. This is useful for checking what commands the tests run.

. Optional: Append `--ginkgo.v` flag to run the tests with increased verbosity.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The default runtime for each test is 300 seconds. 
For valid latency test results, run the tests for at least 12 hours by updating the `LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME` variable.
