= Cluster-level overcommit using the Cluster Resource Override Operator

The Cluster Resource Override Operator is an admission webhook that allows you to control the level of overcommit and manage
container density across all the nodes in your cluster. The Operator controls how nodes in specific projects can exceed defined memory and CPU limits.

// Paragraph taken from 3.11 docs and modified. 
// https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/admin_guide/overcommit.html#configuring-masters-for-overcommitment
The Operator modifies the ratio between the requests and limits that are set on developer containers. In conjunction with a per-project limit range that specifies limits and defaults, you can achieve the desired level of overcommit.

You must install the Cluster Resource Override Operator by using the {product-title} console or CLI as shown in the following sections. After you deploy the Cluster Resource Override Operator, the Operator modifies all new pods in specific namespaces. The Operator does not edit pods that existed before you deployed the Operator. 

During the installation, you create a `ClusterResourceOverride` custom resource (CR), where you set the level of overcommit, as shown in the
following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.autoscaling.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterResourceOverride
metadata:
    name: cluster <1>
spec:
  podResourceOverride:
    spec:
      memoryRequestToLimitPercent: 50 <2>
      cpuRequestToLimitPercent: 25 <3>
      limitCPUToMemoryPercent: 200 <4>
# ...
----
<1> The name must be `cluster`.
<2> Optional. If a container memory limit has been specified or defaulted, the memory request is overridden to this percentage of the limit, between 1-100. The default is 50.
<3> Optional. If a container CPU limit has been specified or defaulted, the CPU request is overridden to this percentage of the limit, between 1-100. The default is 25.
<4> Optional. If a container memory limit has been specified or defaulted, the CPU limit is overridden to a percentage of the memory limit, if specified. Scaling 1Gi of RAM at 100 percent is equal to 1 CPU core. This is processed prior to overriding the CPU request (if configured). The default is 200.

[NOTE]
====
The Cluster Resource Override Operator overrides have no effect if limits have not
been set on containers. Create a `LimitRange` object with default limits per individual project
or configure limits in `Pod` specs for the overrides to apply.
====

When configured, you can enable overrides on a per-project basis by applying the following label to the `Namespace` object for each project where you want the overrides to apply. For example, you can configure override so that infrastructure components are not subject to the overrides.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:

# ...

  labels:
    clusterresourceoverrides.admission.autoscaling.openshift.io/enabled: "true"

# ...
----

The Operator watches for the `ClusterResourceOverride` CR and ensures that the `ClusterResourceOverride` admission webhook is installed into the same namespace as the operator.

// Examples take from: https://github.com/openshift/cluster-resource-override-admission-operator?tab=readme-ov-file#test-pod-resource-override
For example, a pod has the following resources limits:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
  namespace: my-namespace
# ...
spec:
  containers:
    - name: hello-openshift
      image: openshift/hello-openshift
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: "512Mi"
          cpu: "2000m"
# ...
----

The Cluster Resource Override Operator intercepts the original pod request, then overrides the resources according to the configuration set in the `ClusterResourceOverride` object.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
  namespace: my-namespace
# ...
spec:
  containers:
  - image: openshift/hello-openshift
    name: hello-openshift
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: "1" <1>
        memory: 512Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 250m <2>
        memory: 256Mi
# ...
----
<1> The CPU limit has been overridden to `1` because the `limitCPUToMemoryPercent` parameter is set to `200` in the `ClusterResourceOverride` object. As such, 200% of the memory limit, 512Mi in CPU terms, is 1 CPU core. 
<2> The CPU request is now `250m` because the `cpuRequestToLimit` is set to `25` in the `ClusterResourceOverride` object. As such, 25% of the 1 CPU core is 250m.
