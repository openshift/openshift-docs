= Configuring the monitoring stack

In {product-title}, you can configure the stack that monitors workloads for user-defined projects by using the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object. Config maps configure the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO), which in turn configures the components of the stack.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.
* You have created the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Edit the `ConfigMap` object.
.. Edit the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
----

.. Add your configuration under `data.config.yaml` as a key-value pair `<component_name>:{nbsp}<component_configuration>`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>:
      <configuration_for_the_component>
----
+
Substitute `<component>` and `<configuration_for_the_component>` accordingly.
+
The following example `ConfigMap` object configures a data retention period and minimum container resource requests for Prometheus. This relates to the Prometheus instance that monitors user-defined projects only:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus: <1>
      retention: 24h <2>
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 200m <3>
          memory: 2Gi <4>
----
<1> Defines the Prometheus component and the subsequent lines define its configuration.
<2> Configures a 24 hour data retention period for the Prometheus instance that monitors user-defined projects.
<3> Defines a minimum resource request of 200 millicores for the Prometheus container.
<4> Defines a minimum pod resource request of 2 GiB of memory for the Prometheus container.

. Save the file to apply the changes to the `ConfigMap` object. The pods affected by the new configuration are restarted automatically.
+
[WARNING]
====
When changes are saved to a monitoring config map, the pods and other resources in the related project might be redeployed. The running monitoring processes in that project might also be restarted.
