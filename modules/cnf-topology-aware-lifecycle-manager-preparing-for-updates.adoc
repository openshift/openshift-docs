= Setting up the disconnected environment

{cgu-operator} can perform both platform and Operator updates.

You must mirror both the platform image and Operator images that you want to update to in your mirror registry before you can use {cgu-operator} to update your disconnected clusters. Complete the following steps to mirror the images:

* For platform updates, you must perform the following steps:
+
. Mirror the desired {product-title} image repository. Ensure that the desired platform image is mirrored by following the "Mirroring the {product-title} image repository" procedure linked in the Additional resources. Save the contents of the `imageContentSources` section in the `imageContentSources.yaml` file:
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
imageContentSources:
 - mirrors:
   - mirror-ocp-registry.ibmcloud.io.cpak:5000/openshift-release-dev/openshift4
   source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release
 - mirrors:
   - mirror-ocp-registry.ibmcloud.io.cpak:5000/openshift-release-dev/openshift4
   source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev
----

. Save the image signature of the desired platform image that was mirrored. You must add the image signature to the `{policy-gen-cr}` CR for platform updates. To get the image signature, perform the following steps:

.. Specify the desired {product-title} tag by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ OCP_RELEASE_NUMBER=<release_version>
----

.. Specify the architecture of the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ARCHITECTURE=<cluster_architecture> <1>
----
<1> Specify the architecture of the cluster, such as `x86_64`, `aarch64`, `s390x`, or `ppc64le`.


.. Get the release image digest from Quay by running the following command
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ DIGEST="$(oc adm release info quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:${OCP_RELEASE_NUMBER}-${ARCHITECTURE} | sed -n 's/Pull From: .*@//p')"
----

.. Set the digest algorithm by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ DIGEST_ALGO="${DIGEST%%:*}"
----

.. Set the digest signature by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ DIGEST_ENCODED="${DIGEST#*:}"
----

.. Get the image signature from the link:https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/signatures/openshift/release/[mirror.openshift.com] website by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ SIGNATURE_BASE64=$(curl -s "https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/signatures/openshift/release/${DIGEST_ALGO}=${DIGEST_ENCODED}/signature-1" | base64 -w0 && echo)
----

.. Save the image signature to the `checksum-<OCP_RELEASE_NUMBER>.yaml` file by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat >checksum-${OCP_RELEASE_NUMBER}.yaml <<EOF
${DIGEST_ALGO}-${DIGEST_ENCODED}: ${SIGNATURE_BASE64}
EOF
----

. Prepare the update graph. You have two options to prepare the update graph:

.. Use the OpenShift Update Service.
+
For more information about how to set up the graph on the hub cluster, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.4/html/clusters/managing-your-clusters#deploy-the-operator-for-cincinnati[Deploy the operator for OpenShift Update Service] and link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.4/html/clusters/managing-your-clusters#build-the-graph-data-init-container[Build the graph data init container].

.. Make a local copy of the upstream graph. Host the update graph on an `http` or `https` server in the disconnected environment that has access to the managed cluster. To download the update graph, use the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ curl -s https://api.openshift.com/api/upgrades_info/v1/graph?channel=stable-{product-version} -o ~/upgrade-graph_stable-{product-version}
----

* For Operator updates, you must perform the following task:

** Mirror the Operator catalogs. Ensure that the desired operator images are mirrored by following the procedure in the "Mirroring Operator catalogs for use with disconnected clusters" section.
