= Creating a broker by using the Knative CLI

Brokers can be used in combination with triggers to deliver events from an event source to an event sink. Using the Knative (`kn`) CLI to create brokers provides a more streamlined and intuitive user interface over modifying YAML files directly. You can use the `kn broker create` command to create a broker.

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Eventing are installed on your {product-title} cluster.
* You have installed the Knative (`kn`) CLI.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.

.Procedure

* Create a broker:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn broker create <broker_name>
----

.Verification

. Use the `kn` command to list all existing brokers:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn broker list
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME      URL                                                                     AGE   CONDITIONS   READY   REASON
default   http://broker-ingress.knative-eventing.svc.cluster.local/test/default   45s   5 OK / 5     True
----

. Optional: If you are using the {product-title} web console, you can navigate to the *Topology* view in the *Developer* perspective, and observe that the broker exists:
