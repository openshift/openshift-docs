[id="serverless-create-broker-kn_{context}"]
= Creating a broker by using the Knative CLI

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Eventing are installed on your {product-title} cluster.
* You have installed the `kn` CLI.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.

.Procedure

* Create a broker:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn broker create <broker-name>
----
+
You can optionally use the `--class` flag if you want to specify the class of the broker:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn broker create <broker-name> --class <broker-class>
----
+
Currently the supported classes for brokers are:

** The default, multi-tenant, channel-based broker. This is specified by using the `MTChannelBasedBroker` class.
** The Kafka broker (Technology Preview), which is specified by using the `Kafka` class.

.Verification

. Use the `kn` command to list all existing brokers:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn broker list
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME      URL                                                                     AGE   CONDITIONS   READY   REASON
default   http://broker-ingress.knative-eventing.svc.cluster.local/test/default   45s   5 OK / 5     True
----

. Optional: If you are using the {product-title} web console, you can navigate to the **Topology** view in the **Developer** perspective, and observe that the broker exists:
