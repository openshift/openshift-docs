[id="migration-enabling-cached-kubernetes-clients_{context}"]
= Enabling cached Kubernetes clients

You can enable cached Kubernetes clients in the `MigrationController` custom resource (CR) for improved performance during migration. The greatest performance benefit is displayed when migrating between clusters in different regions or with significant network latency.

[NOTE]
====
Delegated tasks, for example, Rsync backup for direct volume migration or Velero backup and restore, however, do not show improved performance with cached clients.
====

Cached clients require extra memory because the `MigrationController` CR caches all API resources that are required for interacting with `MigCluster` CRs. Requests that are normally sent to the API server are directed to the cache instead. The cache watches the API server for updates.

You can increase the memory limits and requests of the `MigrationController` CR if `OOMKilled` errors occur after you enable cached clients.

.Procedure

. Enable cached clients by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-migration patch migrationcontroller migration-controller --type=json --patch \
  '[{ "op": "replace", "path": "/spec/mig_controller_enable_cache", "value": true}]'
----

. Optional: Increase the `MigrationController` CR memory limits by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-migration patch migrationcontroller migration-controller --type=json --patch \
  '[{ "op": "replace", "path": "/spec/mig_controller_limits_memory", "value": <10Gi>}]'
----

. Optional: Increase the `MigrationController` CR memory requests by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-migration patch migrationcontroller migration-controller --type=json --patch \
  '[{ "op": "replace", "path": "/spec/mig_controller_requests_memory", "value": <350Mi>}]'
