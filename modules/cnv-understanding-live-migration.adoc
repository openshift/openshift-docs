= Understanding live migration

Live migration is the process of moving a running virtual machine instance to 
another node in the cluster without interruption to the virtual workload or 
access. This can be a manual process, if you select a virtual machine instance 
to migrate to another node, or an automatic process, if the 
virtual machine instance has a `LiveMigrate` eviction strategy and the node on 
which it is running is placed into maintenance. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Virtual machines must have a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) with a shared 
ReadWriteMany (RWX) access mode to be live migrated.
