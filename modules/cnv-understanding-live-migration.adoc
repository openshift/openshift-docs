= Understanding live migration

Live migration is the process of moving a running virtual machine instance to 
another node in the cluster without interruption to the virtual workload or 
access. This can be a manual process, if you select a virtual machine instance 
to migrate to another node, or an automatic process, if the 
virtual machine instance has a `LiveMigrate` eviction strategy and the node on 
which it is running is placed into maintenance. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Virtual machines must have a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) with a 
ReadWriteMany (RWX) access mode to be live migrated.
====

[NOTE]
====
NFS shared volumes, CephFS volumes, and Ceph RADOS Block Devices (RBDs) are the 
only shared data volume type that are supported for live migration in {CNVProductName} 2.1.
