= Adding registry authentication to prepare for image building

After you have updated the blueprint, you must add authentication for the container registries to build the image with embedded {microshift-short} containers. To do this, update one of the systemd service files that are part of the Image Builder configuration.

.Prerequisites

* You have root-user access to your build host.
* Your build host meets the Image Builder system requirements.
* You have installed and set up Image Builder and the `composer-cli` tool.

[NOTE]
====
You can create an `/etc/osbuild-worker/osbuild-worker.toml` directory and configuration file if they do not exist.
====

.Procedure

. Add a pull secret for authenticating to the registry by setting the `auth_file_path` in the `[containers]` section of the `/etc/osbuild-worker/osbuild-worker.toml` configuration file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
[containers]
auth_file_path = "/etc/osbuild-worker/pull-secret.json"
----

. Restart the host to apply configuration changes.
