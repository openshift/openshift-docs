= Installing OADP on {product-title} with AWS STS

AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) is a global web service that provides short-term credentials for IAM or federated users. {product-title} (ROSA) with STS is the recommended credential mode for ROSA clusters. This document describes how to install OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) on (ROSA) with AWS STS.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Restic is not supported in the OADP on ROSA with AWS STS environment. Ensure the Restic service is disabled. Use native snapshots to backup volumes. See _Known Issues_ for more information.
====

.Prerequisites

* A ROSA OpenShift Cluster with the required access and tokens.
* link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-aws.html#oadp-creating-default-secret_installing-oadp-aws[A default Secret], if your backup and snapshot locations use the same credentials, or if you do not require a snapshot location.

.Procedure

. Create an Openshift secret from your AWS token file by entering the following commands:

.. Create the credentials file:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF > ${SCRATCH}/credentials
[default]
role_arn = ${ROLE_ARN}
web_identity_token_file = /var/run/secrets/openshift/serviceaccount/token
EOF
----

.. Create the OpenShift secret:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-adp create secret generic cloud-credentials \
  --from-file=${SCRATCH}/credentials
----

. Install the OADP Operator.
.. In the {product-title} web console, navigate to Operators *->* OperatorHub.
.. Search for the OADP Operator, then click *Install*.

. Create AWS cloud storage using your AWS credentials:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat << EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: CloudStorage
metadata:
  name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}-oadp
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  creationSecret:
    key: credentials
    name: cloud-credentials
  enableSharedConfig: true
  name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}-oadp
  provider: aws
  region: $REGION
EOF
----

. Create the `DataProtectionApplication resource`, which is used to configure the connection to the storage where the backups and volume snapshots will be stored:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat << EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}-dpa
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  backupLocations:
  - bucket:
      cloudStorageRef:
        name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}-oadp
      credential:
        key: credentials
        name: cloud-credentials
      default: true
  configuration:
    velero:
      defaultPlugins:
      - openshift
      - aws
      restic:
        enable: false
  volumeSnapshots:
  - velero:
      config:
        credentialsFile: /tmp/credentials/openshift-adp/cloud-credentials-credentials
        enableSharedConfig: "true"
        region: ${REGION}
      provider: aws
EOF
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `enable` parameter of `restic` is set to `false` in this configuration because OADP does not support Restic in ROSA environments.
====
+
You are now ready to backup and restore OpenShift applications, as described in the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.html[OADP documentation].
