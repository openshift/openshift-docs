=== Controlling virtual machines

Virtual machines can be started and stopped, depending on the
current state of the virtual machine. The option to restart VMs
is available in the Web Console only.

The `virtctl` client utility is used to change the state of the virtual
machine, open virtual console sessions with the virtual
machines, and expose virtual machine ports as services.

The `virtctl` syntax is: `virtctl <action> <VM-name>`

You can only control objects in the project you are currently working
in, unless you specify the `-n <project_name>` option.

Examples:

----
$ virtctl start example-vm
----

----
$ virtctl stop example-vm
----

`oc get vm` lists the virtual machines in the project. `oc get vmi`
lists running virtual machine instances.
