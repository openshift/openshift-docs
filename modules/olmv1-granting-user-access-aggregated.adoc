= Granting user access to extension resources by using aggregated cluster roles

As a cluster administrator, you can configure role-based access control (RBAC) policies to grant user access to extension resources by using aggregated cluster roles.

To automatically extend existing default cluster roles, you can add _aggregation labels_ by adding one or more of the following labels to a `ClusterRole` object:

.Aggregation labels in a `ClusterRole` object
[source,yaml]
----
# ..
metadata:
  labels:
    rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-admin: "true"
    rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-edit: "true"
    rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-view: "true"
# ..
----

This allows users who already have `view`, `edit`, or `admin` roles to interact with the  custom resource specified by the `ClusterRole` object without requiring additional role or cluster role bindings to specific users or groups.

.Prerequisites

* A cluster extension has been installed on your cluster.
* You have a list of API groups and resource names, as described in "Finding API groups and resources exposed by a cluster extension".

.Procedure

. Create an object definition for a cluster role that specifies the API groups and resources provided by the cluster extension and add an aggregation label to extend one or more existing default cluster roles:
+
.Example `ClusterRole` object with an aggregation label
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: view-custom-resource-aggregated
  labels:
    rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-view: "true"
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - <cluster_extension_api_group>
    resources:
      - <cluster_extension_custom_resource>
    verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
----
+
You can create similar `ClusterRole` objects for `edit` and `admin` with appropriate verbs, such as `create`, `update`, and `delete`. By using aggregation labels, the permissions for the custom resources are added to the default roles.

. Save your object definition to a YAML file.

. Create the object by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <filename>.yaml
