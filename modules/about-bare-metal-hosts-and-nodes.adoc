= About bare metal hosts and nodes

To provision a {op-system-first} bare metal host as a node in your cluster, first create a `MachineSet` custom resource (CR) object that corresponds to the bare metal host hardware. Bare metal host compute machine sets describe infrastructure components specific to your configuration. You apply specific Kubernetes labels to these compute machine sets and then update the infrastructure components to run on only those machines.

`Machine` CR's are created automatically when you scale up the relevant `MachineSet` containing a `metal3.io/autoscale-to-hosts` annotation. {product-title} uses `Machine` CR's to provision the bare metal node that corresponds to the host as specified in the `MachineSet` CR.
