= Reviewing NAB and NAR logs

As a namespace admin user, you can review the logs for the `NonAdminBackup` (NAB) and `NonAdminRestore` (NAR) custom resources (CRs) by creating a `NonAdminDownloadRequest` (NADR) CR.

[NOTE]
====
You can review the NAB logs only if you are using a `NonAdminBackupStorageLocation` (NABSL) CR as a backup storage location for the backup.
====

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the cluster as a namespace admin user.
* The cluster administrator has installed the {oadp-short} Operator.
* The cluster administrator has configured the `DataProtectionApplication` (DPA) CR to enable {oadp-short} Self-Service.
* The cluster administrator has created a namespace for you and has authorized you to operate from that namespace.
* You have a backup of your application by creating a NAB CR.
* You have restored the application by creating a NAR CR.

.Procedure

. To review NAB CR logs, create a `NonAdminDownloadRequest` CR and specify the NAB CR name as shown in the following example:
