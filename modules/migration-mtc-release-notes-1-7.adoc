== New features and enhancements

This release has the following new features and enhancements:

* The {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) Operator now depends upon the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator. When you install the {mtc-short} Operator, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically installs the OADP Operator in the same namespace.

* You can migrate from a source cluster that is behind a firewall to a cloud-based destination cluster by establishing a network tunnel between the two clusters by using the `crane tunnel-api` command.

* Converting storage classes in the MTC web console: You can convert the storage class of a persistent volume (PV) by migrating it within the same cluster.

[id="known-issues-1-7_{context}"]
== Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

* `MigPlan` custom resource does not display a warning when an AWS gp2 PVC has no available space. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1963927[*BZ#1963927*])
* Direct and indirect data transfers do not work if the destination storage is a PV that is dynamically provisioned by the AWS Elastic File System (EFS). This is due to limitations of the AWS EFS Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2085097[*BZ#2085097*])
* Block storage for IBM Cloud must be in the same availability zone. See the link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-vpc-faq[IBM FAQ for block storage for virtual private cloud].
* MTC 1.7.6 cannot migrate cron jobs from source clusters that support `v1beta1` cron jobs to clusters of {product-title} 4.12 and later, which do not support `v1beta1` cron jobs. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2149119[*BZ#2149119*])
