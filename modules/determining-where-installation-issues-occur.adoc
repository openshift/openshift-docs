= Determining where installation issues occur

When troubleshooting {product-title} installation issues, you can monitor installation logs to determine at which stage issues occur. Then, retrieve diagnostic data relevant to that stage.

{product-title} installation proceeds through the following stages:

. Ignition configuration files are created.

. The bootstrap machine boots and starts hosting the remote resources required for the control plane machines (also known as the master machines) to boot.

. The control plane machines fetch the remote resources from the bootstrap machine and finish booting.

. The control plane machines use the bootstrap machine to form an etcd cluster.

. The bootstrap machine starts a temporary Kubernetes control plane using the new etcd cluster.

. The temporary control plane schedules the production control plane to the control plane machines.

. The temporary control plane shuts down and passes control to the production control plane.

. The bootstrap machine adds {product-title} components into the production control plane.

. The installation program shuts down the bootstrap machine.

. The control plane sets up the worker nodes.

. The control plane installs additional services in the form of a set of Operators.

. The cluster downloads and configures remaining components needed for the day-to-day operation, including the creation of worker machines in supported environments.
