= Understanding AWS cloud infrastructure access

[NOTE]
====
AWS cloud infrastructure access does not apply to the Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) infrastructure type that is chosen when you create a cluster because CCS clusters are deployed onto your account.
====


{AWS} infrastructure access permits link:https://access.redhat.com/node/3610411[Customer Portal Organization Administrators] and cluster owners to enable AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users to have federated access to the AWS Management Console for their {product-title} cluster. AWS access can be granted for customer AWS users, and private cluster access can be implemented to suit the needs of your {product-title} environment.

. Get started with configuring AWS infrastructure access for your {product-title} cluster. By creating an AWS user and account and providing that user with access to the {product-title} AWS account.

. After you have access to the {product-title} AWS account, use one or more of the following methods to establish a private connection to your cluster:

- Configuring AWS VPC peering: Enable VPC peering to route network traffic between two private IP addresses.

- Configuring AWS VPN: Establish a Virtual Private Network to securely connect your private network to your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud.

- Configuring AWS Direct Connect: Configure AWS Direct Connect to establish a dedicated network connection between your private network and an AWS Direct Connect location.

// TODO: Was this supposed to be an xref that got yanked? Looks a little odd as is. I'd yank this and add it as an xref in an additional resources or next steps section in the assembly.
After configuring your cloud infrastructure access, learn more about Configuring a private cluster.
