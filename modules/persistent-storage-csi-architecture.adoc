= CSI Architecture

CSI drivers are typically shipped as container images. These containers
are not aware of {product-title} where they run. To use CSI-compatible
storage backend in {product-title}, the cluster administrator must deploy
several components that serve as a bridge between {product-title} and the
storage driver.

The following diagram provides a high-level overview about the components
running in pods in the {product-title} cluster.

It is possible to run multiple CSI drivers for different storage backends.
Each driver needs its own external controllers' deployment and DaemonSet
with the driver and CSI registrar.
