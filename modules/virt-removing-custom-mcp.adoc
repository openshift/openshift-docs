= Removing a custom machine config pool for high-availability clusters

You can delete a custom machine config pool that you previously created for your high-availability cluster.

.Prerequisites
* You have access to the cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have created a custom machine config pool by labeling a subset of the compute nodes with a custom role and creating a `MachineConfigPool` manifest with that label.

.Procedure

. Remove the `worker-dpdk` label from the compute nodes by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label node <node_name> node-role.kubernetes.io/worker-dpdk-
----

. Delete the `MachineConfigPool` manifest that contains the `worker-dpdk` label by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete mcp worker-dpdk
----
