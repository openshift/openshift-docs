Ingress Controllers manage SSL/TLS termination to decrypt incoming SSL/TLS traffic before passing it to the backend services. SSL/TLS termination offloads the encryption/decryption process from the application pods. You can use TLS certificates to encrypt traffic between clients and your services. You can manage certificates with tools, such as `cert-manager`, to automate certificate distribution and renewal.

Routes pass TLS traffic to a pod if it has the SNI field. This process allows services that run TCP to be exposed using TLS and not only HTTP/HTTPS. A site administrator can manage the certificates centrally and allow application developers to read private keys even without permission. 

The Route API enables encryption of router-to-pod traffic with cluster-managed certificates. This ensures external certificates are centrally managed while the internal leg remains encrypted. Application developers receive unique private keys for their applications. These keys can be mounted as a secret in the pod.

Network controls define rules for how pods can communicate with each other and other network endpoints. This enhances security by controlling traffic flow within the cluster. These controls are implemented at the network plugin level to ensure that only allowed traffic flows between pods.

Role-based access control (RBAC) manages permissions and control who can access resources within the cluster. Service accounts provide identity for pods that access the  API. RBAC allows granular control over what each pod can do.
