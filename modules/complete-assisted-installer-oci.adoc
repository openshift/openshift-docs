= Completing the remaining {ai-full} steps - 1

After you provision {oci-first} resources and upload {product-title} custom manifest configuration files to {oci}, you must complete the remaining cluster installation steps on the {ai-full} before you can create an instance {oci}. These steps include assigning node roles and adding custom manifests.

For more details on custom manifests provided by Oracle, see link:https://github.com/dfoster-oracle/oci-openshift/blob/v1.0.0-release-preview/custom_manifests/README.md[Custom Manifests (Oracle documentation).] 

.Prerequisites

* You created a resource stack on {oci} that includes the custom manifest configuration files and {oci} Resource Manager configuration resources. See "Provisioning {oci} infrastructure for your cluster".

.Procedure

. From the {ai-full} user interface, go to the *Host discovery* page.

. Under the *Role* column, select either *Control plane node* or *Worker* for each targeted hostname. Then click *Next*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before continuing to the next step, wait for each node to reach `Ready` status.
====

. Accept the default settings for the *Storage* and *Networking* pages. Then click *Next*.

. On the *Custom manifests* page, in the *Folder* field, select `manifests`. This is the {ai-full} folder where you want to save the custom manifest file.

. In the *File name* field, enter the filename `dynamic_custom_manifest`.

. Paste the contents of the `dynamic_custom_manifest` file that you copied from {oci}:

.. In the *Content* section, click the *Paste content* icon. 

.. Click *OK* to close the dialog box, and then click *Ctrl+V*.  

. Click *Next* to save the custom manifest.

. On the *Review and create* page, click *Install cluster* to create your {product-title} cluster on {oci}.

After the cluster installation and initialization operations, the {ai-full} indicates the completion of the cluster installation operation. For more information, see "Completing the installation" section in the {ai-full} for {product-title} document.
