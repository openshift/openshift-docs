= Completing the remaining {ai-full} steps

After you provision {oci-first} resources and upload {product-title} custom manifest configuration files to {oci}, you must complete the remaining cluster installation steps on the {ai-full} before you can create an instance {oci}.

.Prerequisites

* You created a resource stack on {oci} that includes the custom manifest configuration files and {oci} Resource Manager configuration resources. See "Provisioning {oci} infrastructure for your cluster".

.Procedure

. From the link:https://console.redhat.com/[{hybrid-console}] web console, go to the *Host discovery* page.

. Under the *Role* column, select either `Control plane node` or `Worker` for each targeted hostname.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before, you can continue to the next steps, wait for each node to reach the `Ready` status.
====

. Accept the default settings for the *Storage* and *Networking* steps, and then click *Next*.

. On the *Custom manifests* page, in the *Folder* field, select `manifest`. This is the {ai-full} folder where you want to save the custom manifest file.
.. In the *File name* field, enter a value such as `oci-ccm.yml`.
.. From the *Content* section, click *Browse*, and select the CCM manifest from your drive located in `custom_manifest/manifests/oci-ccm.yml`.

. Expand the next *Custom manifest* section and repeat the same steps for the following manifests:
 - CSI driver manifest: `custom_manifest/manifests/oci-csi.yml`
 - CCM machine configuration: `custom_manifest/openshift/machineconfig-ccm.yml`
 - CSI driver machine configuration: `custom_manifest/openshift/machineconfig-csi.yml`

. From the *Review and create* page, click *Install cluster* to create your {product-title} cluster on {oci}.

After the cluster installation and initialization operations, the {ai-full} indicates the completion of the cluster installation operation. For more information, see "Completing the installation" section in the _{ai-full} for {product-title}_ document.
