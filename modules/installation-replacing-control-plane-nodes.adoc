= Replacing control plane nodes in a two-node OpenShift cluster with fencing

You can replace a failed control plane node in a two-node OpenShift cluster. The replacement node must use the same host name and IP address as the failed node.

.Prerequisites

* You have a functioning survivor control plane node.  
* You have verified that either the machine is not running or the node is not ready.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You know the host name and IP address of the failed node.

[NOTE]
====
Do an etcd backup before proceeding to ensure that you can restore the cluster if any issues occur.
====

.Procedure

. Check the quorum state by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo pcs quorum status
----

.. If quorum is lost and one control plane node is still running, restore quorum manually on the survivor node by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo pcs quorum unblock
----

.. If only one node failed, verify that etcd is running on the survivor node by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo pcs resource status etcd
----

.. If etcd is not running, restart etcd by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo pcs resource cleanup etcd
----
+
If etcd still does not start, force it manually on the survivor node, skipping fencing:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Before running this commands, ensure that the node being replaced is inaccessible. Otherwise, you risk etcd corruption.
====
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo pcs resource debug-stop etcd
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo OCF_RESKEY_CRM_meta_notify_start_resource='etcd' pcs resource debug-start etcd
----
+
After recovery, etcd must be running successfully on the survivor node.

. Delete etcd secrets for the failed node by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project openshift-etcd
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete secret etcd-peer-<node_name>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete secret etcd-serving-<node_name>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete secret etcd-serving-metrics-<node_name>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
To replace the failed node, you must delete its etcd secrets first. When etcd is running, it might take some time for the API server to respond to these commands.
====

. Delete resources for the failed node:

.. If you have the `BareMetalHost` (BMH) objects, list them to identify the host you are replacing by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get bmh -n openshift-machine-api
----

.. Delete the BMH object for the failed node by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete bmh/<bmh_name> -n openshift-machine-api
----

.. List the `Machine` objects to identify the object that maps to the node that you are replacing by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machines.machine.openshift.io -n openshift-machine-api
----

.. Get the label with the machine hash value from the `Machine` object by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machines.machine.openshift.io/<machine_name> -n openshift-machine-api \ 
  -o jsonpath='Machine hash label: {.metadata.labels.machine\.openshift\.io/cluster-api-cluster}{"\n"}'
----
+
Replace `<machine_name>` with the name of a `Machine` object in your cluster. For example, `ostest-bfs7w-ctrlplane-0`.
+
You need this label to provision a new `Machine` object.

.. Delete the `Machine` object for the failed node by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete machines.machine.openshift.io/<machine_name>-<failed nodename> -n openshift-machine-api
---- 
+
[NOTE]
====
The node object is deleted automatically after deleting the `Machine` object.
====

. Recreate the failed host by using the same name and IP address:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must perform this step only if you are using installer-provisioned infrastructure or the Machine API to create the original node.  
For information about replacing a failed bare-metal control plane node, see "Replacing an unhealthy etcd member on bare metal".
====

.. Remove the BMH and `Machine` objects. The machine controller automatically deletes the node object.

.. Provision a new machine by using the following sample configuration:
+

* `metadata.name`: Specify the name of the secret.
* `metadata.name`: Replace `{bmh_name}` with the name of the BMH object that you deleted.
* `bmc.address`: Replace `{uuid}` with the UUID of the node that you created.
* `bmc.credentialsName`: Replace `name` with the name of the secret that you created. 
* `bootMACAddress`: Specify the MAC address of the provisioning network interface. This is the MAC address the node uses to identify itself when communicating with Ironic during provisioning.

. Verify that the new node has reached the `Provisioned` state by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get bmh -o wide
----
+
The value of the `STATUS` column in the output of this command must be `Provisioned`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The provisioning process can take 10 to 20 minutes to complete.
====

. Verify that both control plane nodes are in the `Ready` state by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----
+
The value of the `STATUS` column in the output of this command must be `Ready` for both nodes.

. Apply the `detached` annotation to the BMH object to prevent the Machine API from managing it by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate bmh <bmh_name> -n openshift-machine-api baremetalhost.metal3.io/detached='' --overwrite
----

. Rejoin the replacement node to the pacemaker cluster by running the following command:
+
[NOTE]
====
Run the following command on the survivor control plane node, not the node being replaced.
====
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo pcs cluster node remove <node_name>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo pcs cluster node add <node_name> addr=<node_ip> --start --enable
----

. Delete stale jobs for the failed node by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project openshift-etcd
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete job tnf-auth-job-<node_name>
----
