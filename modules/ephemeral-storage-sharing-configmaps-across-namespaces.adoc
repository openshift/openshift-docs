= Sharing a ConfigMap object across namespaces

[role="_abstract"] 

A `ConfigMap` object stores non-sensitive configuration data, such as application URLs or feature flags. A `SharedConfigMap` custom resource (CR) enables you to securely share a `ConfigMap` object across multiple namespaces in a cluster without manual duplication. By sharing a `ConfigMap` object, you establish a single source of configuration data and ensure consistency across the cluster.
