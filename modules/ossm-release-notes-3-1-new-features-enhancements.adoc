[id="support-for-kubernetes-gateway-api_{context}"]
== Support for Kubernetes Gateway API

This release introduces support for {k8s} Gateway API custom resource definitions (CRDs). You can now use these CRDs to configure {SMProduct} with the {k8s} Gateway API. This feature is available with {product-title} 4.19.

[id="support-for-ossm-on-x86-dual-stack-clusters_{context}"]
== Support for OpenShift Service Mesh on x86 dual-stack clusters

This release introduces support for {SMProduct} on x86 dual-stack clusters. This feature remains a technology preview on all other platforms.

[id="kubernetes-traffic-distribution-support_{context}"]
== Kubernetes Traffic Distribution Support

This release introduces support for the {k8s} traffic distribution feature, part of the {k8s} Service API, within {SMProduct}. As of {product-title} 4.19, this is a Beta feature and requires enabling the `ServiceTrafficDistribution` parameter in the {istio} Custom Resources (CRs).

[id="developer-preview-kubernetes-clustertrustbundle_{context}"]
== Developer Preview for Kubernetes ClusterTrustBundle

This release introduces developer preview support for the experimental {k8s} `ClusterTrustBundle` feature. This feature provides a new way of distributing X.509 trust anchors (root certificates) to workloads within the cluster. As of {product-title} 4.19, this is an Alpha feature and requires enabling the `ClusterTrustBundle` feature.

[id="ubi-micro-base-containers_{context}"]
== UBI-micro base containers

This release updates {SMProduct} to use UBI-micro base containers for most container images. The UBI-micro image is the smallest possible Universal Base Image (UBI), which excludes a package manager and all of its dependencies normally included in a container image. This change minimizes the attack surface of container images that use the UBI-micro base.
