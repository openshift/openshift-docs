= About determining which pod volumes to back up

Before you start a backup operation by using File System Backup (FSB), you must specify which pods contain a volume that you want to back up. Velero refers to this process as "discovering" the appropriate pod volumes.

Velero supports two approaches for determining pod volumes:

* *Opt-in approach*: The opt-in approach requires that you actively indicate that you want to include - _opt-in_ - a volume in a backup. You do this by labelling each pod that contains a volume to be backed up with the name of the volume. When Velero finds a persistent volume (PV), it checks the pod that mounted the volume. If the pod is labelled with the name of the volume, Velero backs up the pod.
* *Opt-out approach*: With the opt-out approach, you must actively specify that you want to exclude a volume from a backup. You do this by labelling each pod that contains a volume you do not want to back up with the name of the volume. When Velero finds a PV, it checks the pod that mounted the volume. If the pod is labelled with the volume's name, Velero does not back up the pod.

== Limitations

* FSB does not support backing up and restoring `hostpath` volumes. However, FSB does support backing up and restoring local volumes.
* Velero uses a static, common encryption key for all backup repositories it creates. *This static key means that anyone who can access your backup storage can also decrypt your backup data*. It is essential that you limit access to backup storage.
* For PVCs, every incremental backup chain is maintained across pod reschedules.
+
For pod volumes that are _not_ PVCs, such as `emptyDir` volumes, if
a pod is deleted or recreated, for example, by a `ReplicaSet` or a deployment, the next backup of those volumes will be a full backup and not an incremental backup. It is assumed that the lifecycle of a pod volume is defined by its pod.
* Even though backup data can be kept incrementally, backing up large files, such as a database, can take a long time. This is because FSB uses deduplication to find the difference that needs to be backed up.
* FSB reads and writes data from volumes by accessing the file system of the node on which the pod is running. For this reason, FSB can only back up volumes that are mounted from a pod and not directly from a PVC. Some Velero users have overcome this limitation by running a staging pod, such as a BusyBox or Alpine container with an infinite sleep, to mount these PVC and PV pairs before performing a Velero backup..
* FSB expects volumes to be mounted under `<hostPath>/<pod UID>`, with
`<hostPath>` being configurable. Some Kubernetes systems, for example,
vCluster, do not mount volumes under the `<pod UID>` subdirectory, and
VFSB does not work with them as expected.
