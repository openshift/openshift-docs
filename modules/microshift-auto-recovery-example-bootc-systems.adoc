= Using automatic recovery in image mode for {op-system-base} systems

:FeatureName: Image mode for {op-system-base}

include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

As a use case, consider the following example situation in which you want to automate the `auto-recovery` process for image mode for {op-system-base-full} systems that use the systemd service.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must include the entire `auto-recovery` process for {op-system-image} systems that use `systemd` in the container file.
====

.Prerequisites

* You created a Containerfile as instructed in link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_build_of_microshift/4.18/html/installing_with_rhel_image_mode/installing-with-rhel-image-mode#microshift-rhel-image-mode-build-image_microshift-install-rhel-image-mode[Building the bootc image].

* You created the `10-auto-recovery.conf` and `microshift-auto-recovery.service` files as explained in the "Using auto-recovery in RPM systems" section.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The location of the the `10-auto-recovery.conf` and `microshift-auto-recovery.service` must be relative to the Containerfile.

For example, if the path to the Containerfile is `/home/microshift/my-build/Containerfile`, the systemd files need to be adjacent for proper embedding. The following paths are correct for this example:

* `/home/microshift/my-build/auto-rec/10-auto-recovery.conf`
* `/home/microshift/my-build/auto-rec/microshift-auto-recovery.service`
* `/home/microshift/my-build/auto-rec/microshift-auto-recovery`
====

* You created the `microshift-auto-recovery` script as explained in the "Using auto-recovery in RPM systems" section.

.Procedure

. Use the following example snippet to update the container file that you use to prepare the {op-system-image} image.
+
[source,text]
----
RUN mkdir -p /usr/lib/systemd/system/microshift.service.d
COPY ./auto-rec/10-auto-recovery.conf /usr/lib/systemd/system/microshift.service.d/10-auto-recovery.conf
COPY ./auto-rec/microshift-auto-recovery.service /usr/lib/systemd/system/
COPY ./auto-rec/microshift-auto-recovery /usr/bin/
RUN chmod +x /usr/bin/microshift-auto-recovery
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Podman uses the host subscription information and repositories inside the container when building the container image. If the `rhocp` and `fast-datapath` repositories are not available on the host, the build fails.
====

. Rebuild your local bootc image by running the following image build command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
PULL_SECRET=~/.pull-secret.json
USER_PASSWD=<your_redhat_user_password>
IMAGE_NAME=microshift-4.18-bootc

sudo podman build --authfile "${PULL_SECRET}" -t "${IMAGE_NAME}" \
    --build-arg USER_PASSWD="${USER_PASSWD}" \
    -f Containerfile
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Secrets are used during the image build in the following ways:

* The podman `--authfile` argument is required to pull the base `rhel-bootc:9.4` image from the `registry.redhat.io` registry.

* The build `USER_PASSWD` argument is used to set a password for the `redhat user`.
====

.Verification

* Verify that the local bootc image was created by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo podman images "${IMAGE_NAME}"
----
