= AWS EFS troubleshooting

The following information provides guidance on how to troubleshoot issues with AWS EFS:

* The AWS EFS Operator and CSI driver run in namespace `openshift-cluster-csi-drivers`.

* To initiate gathering of logs of the AWS EFS Operator and CSI driver, run the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather
[must-gather      ] OUT Using must-gather plugin-in image: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev@sha256:125f183d13601537ff15b3239df95d47f0a604da2847b561151fedd699f5e3a5

* To show AWS EFS Operator errors, view the `ClusterCSIDriver` status:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc get clustercsidriver efs.csi.aws.com -o yaml
----

* If a volume cannot be mounted to a pod (as shown in the output of the following command):
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ oc describe pod
