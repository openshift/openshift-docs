[id="nodes-pods-image-volume-adding_{context}"]
= Adding an image volume to a pod

To mount an Open Container Initiative (OCI)-compliant container image or artifact, use the `volume` parameter to include a path to the image or artifact in your pod spec with an optional pull policy. You can create the pod directly or use a controlling object, such as a deployment or replica set. 

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file similar to the following.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: image-volume
spec:
  containers:
  - name: shell
    command: ["sleep", "infinity"]
    image: debian
    volumeMounts:
    - name: volume
      mountPath: /volume
  volumes:
  - name: volume 
    image: <1>
      reference: quay.io/crio/artifact:v2 <2>
      pullPolicy: Always <3>
----
<1> Specifies an OCI container image or artifact that is available on the host machine. 
<2> Specifies the path to the image or artifact.
<3> Specifies a pull policy, one of the following options:
+
--
* If `Always`, the kubelet always attempts to pull the image. If the pull fails, the kubelet sets the pod to `Failed`.
* If `Never`, the kubelet never pulls the image and only uses a local image or artifact. The pod becomes `Failed` if any layers of the image are not present locally, or if the manifest for that image is not already cached.
* If `IfNotPresent` the kubelet pulls the image if it not present. The pod becomes `Failed` if the image is not present and the pull fails. This is the default.
--
// Pull policy details from upstream: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#image

. Create the pod by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <file_name>.yaml
----

.Verification

* Examine the pod to view detailed information about the image pull and mount by using a command similar to the following:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe pod <pod_name>
----
+
