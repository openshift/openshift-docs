= Configuring the pruner

You can use the `TektonConfig` custom resource to configure periodic pruning of resources associated with pipeline runs and task runs.

The following example corresponds to the default configuration:

.Supported parameters for pruner configuration
|===
| Parameter | Description

|`schedule`
|The Cron schedule for running the pruner process. The default schedule runs the process at 08:00 every day. For more information about the Cron schedule syntax, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/#cron-schedule-syntax[Cron schedule syntax] in the Kubernetes documentation.

|`resources`
|The resource types to which the pruner applies. The available resource types are `taskrun` and `pipelinerun`

|`keep`
|The number of most recent resources of every type to keep.

|`prune-per-resource`
|If set to `false`, the value for the `keep` parameter denotes the total number of task runs or pipeline runs. For example, if `keep` is set to `100`, then the pruner keeps 100 most recent task runs and 100 most recent pipeline runs and removes all other resources.

If set to `true`, the value for the `keep` parameter is calculated separately for pipeline runs referencing each pipeline and for task runs referencing each task. For example, if `keep` is set to `100`, then the pruner keeps 100 most recent pipeline runs for `Pipeline1`, 100 most recent pipeline runs for `Pipeline2`, 100 most recent task runs for `Task1`, and so on, and removes all other resources.

|`keep-since`
|The maximum time for which to keep resources, in minutes. For example, to retain resources which were created not more than five days ago, set `keep-since` to `7200`.

|`startingDeadlineSeconds`
|This parameter is optional. If the pruner job is not started at the scheduled time for any reason, this setting configures the maximum time, in seconds, in which the job can still be started. If the job is not started within the specified time, {pipelines-shortname} considers this job failed and starts the pruner at the next scheduled time. If you do not specify this parameter and the pruner job does not start at the scheduled time, {pipelines-shortname} attempts to start the job at any later time possible.

[NOTE]
====
The `keep` and `keep-since` parameters are mutually exclusive. Use only one of them in your configuration.
