= Disabling the {ocp-product-title} documentation RAG database 

Modify the `OLSConfig` custom resource (CR) file to disable the built-in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) database that contains the {ocp-product-title} documentation. Then, the only RAG databases {ols-long} uses are the ones that you provide using the BYO Knowledge feature.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the {ocp-product-title} web console as a user account with permission to create a cluster-scoped CR file, such as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

* You have installed the {ols-long} Operator.

* You have configured the large language model provider.

* You have configured the `OLSConfig` CR file, which automatically deploys the {ols-long} Service.

* You have created a RAG database that contains the content you want to use, as described in "Providing custom knowledge to the LLM".

.Procedure 

. In the {ocp-product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*. 

. Select *All Projects* in the  *Project* list at the top of the screen.

. Click *{ols-long} Operator*.

. Click *OLSConfig*, then click the `cluster` configuration instance in the list.

. Click the *YAML* tab.

. Insert the `spec.ols.byokRAGOnly` YAML code.

----
<1> Specify `true` so that {ols-long} only uses RAG databases that you create using the BYO Knowledge feature. When `true`, {ols-long} does not use the default RAG database that contains the {ocp-product-title} documentation.
