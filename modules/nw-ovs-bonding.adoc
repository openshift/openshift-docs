= Open vSwitch (OVS) bonding

With an OVS bonding configuration, you create a single, logical interface by connecting each physical network interface controller (NIC) as a port to a specific bond. This single bond then handles all network traffic, effectively replacing the function of individual interfaces.

Consider the following architectural layout for OVS bridges that interact with OVS interfaces:

* A network interface uses a bridge MAC address for managing protocol-level traffic and other administrative tasks, such as IP address assignment.
* The physical MAC addresses of physical interfaces do not handle traffic.
* OVS handles all MAC address management at the OVS bridge level.

This layout simplies bond interface management as bonds acts as data paths where centralized MAC address management happens at the OVS bridge level.

For OVS bonding, you can select either `active-backup` mode or `balance-slb` mode. A bonding mode specifies the policy for how bond interfaces get used during network transmission.
