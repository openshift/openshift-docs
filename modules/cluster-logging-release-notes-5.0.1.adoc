== Bug fixes

* If you did not set `.proxy` in the cluster installation configuration, and then configured a global proxy on the installed cluster, a bug prevented Fluentd from forwarding logs to Elasticsearch. To work around this issue, in the proxy/cluster configuration, set `no_proxy` to `.svc.cluster.local` so it skips internal traffic. The current release fixes the proxy configuration issue. Now, if you configure the global proxy after installing an OpenShift cluster, Fluentd forwards logs to Elasticsearch. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1187[*LOG-1187*])
