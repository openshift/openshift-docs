== Bug fixes

* Previously, if you enabled legacy log forwarding, logs were not sent to managed storage. This issue occurred because the generated log forwarding configuration improperly chose between either log forwarding or legacy log forwarding. The current release fixes this issue. If the `ClusterLogging` CR defines a `logstore`, logs are sent to managed storage. Additionally, if legacy log forwarding is enabled, logs are sent to legacy log forwarding regardless of whether managed storage is enabled.

* Previously, while under load, Elasticsearch responded to some requests with an HTTP 500 error, even though there was nothing wrong with the cluster. Retrying the request was successful. This release fixes the issue by updating the cron jobs to be more resilient when encountering temporary HTTP 500 errors. Now, they will retry a request multiple times first before failing.
