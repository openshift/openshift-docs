= Configuring the Ansible inventory file to use hooks

You define the hooks to use when you update the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
compute machines, which are also known as worker machines, in the `hosts` inventory file under the `all:vars`
section.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the machine that you used to add the RHEL compute machines
cluster. You must have access to the `hosts` Ansible inventory file that defines
your RHEL machines.


.Procedure

. After you design the hook, create a YAML file that defines the Ansible tasks
for it. This file must be a set of tasks and cannot be a playbook, as shown in
the following example:
+
[source.yaml]
----
---
# Trivial example forcing an operator to acknowledge the start of an upgrade
# file=/home/user/openshift-ansible/hooks/pre_compute.yml

- name: note the start of a compute machine update
  debug:
      msg: "Compute machine upgrade of {{ inventory_hostname }} is about to start"

- name: require the user agree to start an upgrade
  pause:
      prompt: "Press Enter to start the compute machine update"
----

. Modify the `hosts` Ansible inventory file to specify the hook files. The
hook files are specified as parameter values in the `[all:vars]` section,
as shown:
+
.Example hook definitions in an inventory file
[source]
----
[all:vars]
openshift_node_pre_upgrade_hook=/home/user/openshift-ansible/hooks/pre_node.yml
openshift_node_post_upgrade_hook=/home/user/openshift-ansible/hooks/post_node.yml
----
+
To avoid ambiguity in the paths to the hook, use absolute paths instead of a
relative paths in their definitions.
