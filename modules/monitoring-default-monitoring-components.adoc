|Component|Description

|Cluster Monitoring Operator
|The Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) is a central component of the monitoring stack. It deploys and manages Prometheus instances, the Thanos Querier, the Telemeter Client, and metrics targets and ensures that they are up to date. The CMO is deployed by the Cluster Version Operator (CVO).

|Prometheus Operator
|The Prometheus Operator (PO) in the `openshift-monitoring` project creates, configures, and manages platform Prometheus instances and Alertmanager instances. It also automatically generates monitoring target configurations based on Kubernetes label queries.

|Prometheus
|Prometheus is the monitoring system on which the {product-title} monitoring stack is based. Prometheus is a time-series database and a rule evaluation engine for metrics. Prometheus sends alerts to Alertmanager for processing.

|Prometheus Adapter
|The Prometheus Adapter (PA in the preceding diagram) translates Kubernetes node and pod queries for use in Prometheus. The resource metrics that are translated include CPU and memory utilization metrics. The Prometheus Adapter exposes the cluster resource metrics API for horizontal pod autoscaling. The Prometheus Adapter is also used by the `oc adm top nodes` and `oc adm top pods` commands.

|Alertmanager
|The Alertmanager service handles alerts received from Prometheus. Alertmanager is also responsible for sending the alerts to external notification systems.

|`kube-state-metrics` agent
|The `kube-state-metrics` exporter agent (KSM in the preceding diagram) converts Kubernetes objects to metrics that Prometheus can use.

|`openshift-state-metrics` agent
|The `openshift-state-metrics` exporter (OSM in the preceding diagram) expands upon `kube-state-metrics` by adding metrics for {product-title}-specific resources.

|`node-exporter` agent
|The `node-exporter` agent (NE in the preceding diagram) collects metrics about every node in a cluster. The `node-exporter` agent is deployed on every node.

|Thanos Querier
|The Thanos Querier aggregates and optionally deduplicates core {product-title} metrics and metrics for user-defined projects under a single, multi-tenant interface.

|Telemeter Client
|The Telemeter Client sends a subsection of the data from platform Prometheus instances to Red Hat to facilitate Remote Health Monitoring for clusters.

|===

All of the components in the monitoring stack are monitored by the stack and are automatically updated when {product-title} is updated.

[NOTE]
====
All components of the monitoring stack use the TLS security profile settings that are centrally configured by a cluster administrator.
If you configure a monitoring stack component that uses TLS security settings, the component uses the TLS security profile settings that already exist in the `tlsSecurityProfile` field in the global {product-title} `apiservers.config.openshift.io/cluster` resource.
