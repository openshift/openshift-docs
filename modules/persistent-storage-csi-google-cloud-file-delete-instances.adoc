= Destroying clusters and GCP Filestore

Typically, if you destroy a cluster, the {product-title} installer deletes all of the cloud resources that belong to that cluster. However, when a cluster is destroyed, Google Compute Platform (GCP) Filestore instances are not automatically deleted, so you must manually delete all persistent volume claims (PVCs) that use the Filestore storage class before destroying the cluster.

.Procedure
To delete all GCP Filestore PVCs:

. List all PVCs that were created using the storage class `filestore-csi`:
+
[source, command]
----
$ oc get pvc -o json -A | jq -r '.items[] | select(.spec.storageClassName == "filestore-csi")
----

. Delete all of the PVCs listed by the previous command:
+
[source, command]
----
$ oc delete <pvc-name> <1>
----
<1> Replace <pvc-name> with the name of any PVC that you need to delete.
