= Common questions about update availability

There are several factors that affect if and when an update is made available to an {product-title} cluster. The following list provides common questions regarding the availability of an update:

*What are the differences between each of the different update channels?*

* A new release is initially added to the `candidate` channel and is often available as an update target for clusters on the `candidate` channel.

* After successful internal and external testing, a release on the `candidate` channel is supported by being promoted to the `fast` channel and is often available to clusters on the `fast` channel.

* After a short delay and more successful testing, a release on the `fast` channel is finally promoted to the `stable` channel and is often available to clusters on the `stable` channel. This delay represents the only difference between the `fast` and `stable` channels.

* Releases promoted to the `stable` channel are simultaneously promoted to the `eus` channel.
The primary purpose of the `eus` channel is to serve as a convenience for clusters performing an EUS-to-EUS update.

*Is a release on the `stable` channel safer or more supported than a release on the fast channel?*

* If a regression is identified for a release on a `fast` channel, it will be resolved and managed to the same extent as if that regression was identified for a release on the `stable` channel.

* The only difference between releases on the `fast` and `stable` channels is that a release only appears on the `stable` channel after it has been on the `fast` channel for a short period and has not had any major issues.

** This delay is used to further test and gather data about a release that is on the `fast` channel, but otherwise there is no difference between releases on each of the channels.

*What does it mean if an update is supported but not recommended?*

* Red Hat continuously evaluates data from multiple sources to determine whether updates from one version to another lead to issues.
If an issue is identified, an update path may no longer be recommended to users.
However, even if the update path is not recommended, customers are still supported if they perform the update.

* Red Hat does not block users from updating to a certain version.
Red Hat may declare conditional update risks, which may or may not apply to a particular cluster.

** Declared risks provide cluster administrators more context about a supported update.
Cluster administrators can still accept the risk and update to that particular target version.
This update is always supported despite not being recommended in the context of the conditional risk.

*What if I see that an update to a particular release is no longer recommended?*

* If Red Hat removes update recommendations from any supported release due to a regression, a superseding update recommendation will be provided to a future version that corrects the regression.
There may be a delay while the defect is corrected, tested, and promoted to your selected channel.

*How long until the next z-stream release is made available on the fast and stable channels?*
