[id="known-issues_{context}"]
== Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

* OADP backups might fail because a UID/GID range might have changed on the cluster where the application has been restored, with the result that OADP does not back up and restore OpenShift Container Platform UID/GID range metadata. To avoid the issue, if the backed application requires a specific UUID, ensure the range is available when restored. An additional workaround is to allow OADP to create the namespace in the restore operation.

* A restoration might fail if ArgoCD is used during the process due to a label used by ArgoCD, `app.kubernetes.io/instance`. This label identifies which resources ArgoCD needs to manage, which can create a conflict with OADPâ€™s procedure for managing resources on restoration. To work around this issue, set `.spec.resourceTrackingMethod` on the ArgoCD YAML to `annotation+label` or `annotation`. If the issue continues to persist, then disable ArgoCD before beginning to restore, and enable it again when restoration is finished.
