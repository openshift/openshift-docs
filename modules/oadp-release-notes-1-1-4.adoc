[id="resolved-issues1.1.4_{context}"]
== Resolved issues

.Add support for all the velero deployment server arguments

In previous releases of OADP, OADP did not facilitate the support of all the upstream Velero server arguments. This issue has been resolved in OADP 1.1.4 and all the upstream Velero server arguments are supported. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-1557[OADP-1557]


.Data Mover can restore from an incorrect snapshot when there was more than one VSR for the restore name and pvc name

In previous releases of OADP, OADP Data Mover could restore from an incorrect snapshot if there was more than one Volume Snapshot Restore (VSR) resource in the cluster for the same Velero `restore` name and PersistentVolumeClaim (pvc) name. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-1822[OADP-1822]


.Cloud Storage API BSLs need OwnerReference

In previous releases of OADP, ACM BackupSchedules failed validation because of a missing `OwnerReference` on Backup Storage Locations (BSLs) created with `dpa.spec.backupLocations.bucket`. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-1511[OADP-1511]

[id="known-issues1.1.4_{context}"]
== Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

.OADP backups might fail because a UID/GID range might have changed on the cluster

OADP backups might fail because a UID/GID range might have changed on the cluster where the application has been restored, with the result that OADP does not back up and restore {product-title} UID/GID range metadata. To avoid the issue, if the backed application requires a specific UUID, ensure the range is available when restored. An additional workaround is to allow OADP to create the namespace in the restore operation.

.A restoration might fail if ArgoCD is used during the process due to a label used by ArgoCD

A restoration might fail if ArgoCD is used during the process due to a label used by ArgoCD, `app.kubernetes.io/instance`. This label identifies which resources ArgoCD needs to manage, which can create a conflict with OADP's procedure for managing resources on restoration. To work around this issue, set `.spec.resourceTrackingMethod` on the ArgoCD YAML to `annotation+label` or `annotation`. If the issue continues to persist, then disable ArgoCD before beginning to restore, and enable it again when restoration is finished.

.OADP Velero plugins returning "received EOF, stopping recv loop" message

Velero plugins are started as separate processes. When the Velero operation has completed, either successfully or not, they exit. Therefore if you see a `received EOF, stopping recv loop` messages in debug logs, it does not mean an error occurred. The message indicates that a plugin operation has completed. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-2176[OADP-2176]
