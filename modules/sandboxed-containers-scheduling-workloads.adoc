[id="sandboxed-containers-scheduling-workloads_{context}"]
= Scheduling {sandboxed-containers-first} workloads

You can schedule your workloads to run on {sandboxed-containers-first}.

.Prerequisites

* You have {product-title} {product-version} installed on your cluster.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Add `runtimeClassName: kata` to any pod-templated resources:
* `Pod` objects
* `ReplicaSet` objects
* `ReplicationController` objects
* `StatefulSet` objects
* `Deployment` objects
* `DeploymentConfig` objects

.Example for Pod objects
[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
   name: mypod
  spec:
    runtimeClassName: kata
----

.Example for Deployment objects
[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: mypod
    labels:
      app: mypod
  spec:
    replicas: 3
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: mypod
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: mypod
      spec:
        runtimeClassName: kata
        containers:
        - name: mypod
          image: myImage
----

After the pod-templated resource is created with `runtimeClassName: kata`, {product-title} begins scheduling the workload on {sandboxed-containers-first} enabled nodes. If no selector is used, the default is set to all worker nodes.  Your workload runs on {sandboxed-containers-first}.
