= Verifying and troubleshooting VPC peering

After you set up a VPC peering connection, it is best to confirm it has been
configured and is working correctly.

.Prerequisites

* Initiate and accept the VPC peer request.
* Configure the routing tables.

.Procedure

* In the AWS console, look at the route table for the cluster VPC that is peered.
Ensure that the steps for configuring the routing tables were followed and that
there is a route table entry pointing the VPC CIDR range destination to the
peering connection target.
+
If the routes look correct on both the {product-title} Cluster VPC route table
and Customer VPC route table, then the connection should be tested using the
`netcat` method below. If the test calls are successful, then VPC peering is
working correctly.

* To test network connectivity to an endpoint device, `nc` (or `netcat`) is a
helpful troubleshooting tool. It is included in the default image and provides
quick and clear output if a connection can be established:

.. Create a temporary Pod using the `busybox` image, which cleans up after itself:
+
----
$ oc run netcat-test \
    --image=busybox -i -t \
    --restart=Never --rm \
    -- /bin/sh
----

.. Check the connection using `nc`.
+
--
* Example successful connection results:
+
----
/ nc -zvv 192.168.1.1 8080
10.181.3.180 (10.181.3.180:8080) open
sent 0, rcvd 0
----

* Example failed connection results:
+
----
/ nc -zvv 192.168.1.2 8080
nc: 10.181.3.180 (10.181.3.180:8081): Connection refused
sent 0, rcvd 0
----
--

.. Exit the container, which automatically deletes the Pod:
+
----
/ exit
----
