= Ingress

Ingress is a resource that provides advanced routing capabilities, including load balancing, SSL/TLS termination, and name-based virtual hosting. Here are some key points about Ingress:

* HTTP/HTTPS routing: You can use Ingress to define rules for routing HTTP and HTTPS traffic to services within the cluster. 
* Load balancing: Ingress Controllers, such as NGINX or HAProxy, manage traffic routing and load balancing based on user-defined defined rules. 
* SSL/TLS termination: SSL/TLS termination is the process of decrypting incoming SSL/TLS traffic before passing it to the backend services. 
* Multiple domains and paths: Ingress supports routing traffic for multiple domains and paths.
