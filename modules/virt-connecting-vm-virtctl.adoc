= Connecting to the {console} by using virtctl

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the `virtctl` command-line tool to connect to the {console} of a running virtual machine.

ifdef::vnc-console[]
[NOTE]
====
If you run the `virtctl vnc` command on a remote machine over an SSH connection, you must forward the X session to your local machine by running the `ssh` command with the `-X` or `-Y` flags.
====

.Prerequisites

* You must install the `virt-viewer` package.

.Procedure

. Run the following command to start the console session:
+
ifdef::serial-console[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ virtctl console <vm_name>
----

. Press `Ctrl+]` to end the console session.
endif::[]
ifdef::vnc-console[]
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ virtctl vnc <vm_name> -n <namespace> --preserve-session
----
+
where:
+
<vm_name>:: The name of the VM.
+
<namespace>:: The namespace that contains the VM.
+
--preserve-session:: Prevents an existing VNC console connection from being disconnected if you attempt to start a new session.
+
Only one connection to the VNC console is possible at a time. If you attempt to create a second connection to the same VNC console, an error is displayed and the connection fails.
+
Example error message:
+
[source,terminal]
----
can't access VMI example-vm: Internal error occurred: Can't connect to websocket (503): websocket: bad handshake: application info: Active VNC connection. Request denied.
----
+
If you attempt to create a second connection to the same VNC console without using the `--preserve-session` flag, this forces the existing connection to disconnect to allow the new connection.

. If the connection fails, run the following command to collect troubleshooting information:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ virtctl vnc <vm_name> -v 4
----
