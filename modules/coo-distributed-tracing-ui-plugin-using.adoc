= Using the {coo-full} distributed tracing UI plugin

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
* You have logged in to the {product-title} web console.
* You have installed the {coo-full}.
* You have installed the {coo-full} distributed tracing UI plugin.
* You have a `TempoStack` or `TempoMonolithic` multi-tenant instance in the cluster.

.Procedure

. In the Administrator perspective of the {product-title} web console, click **Observe** â†’ **Traces**.
. Select a `TempoStack` or `TempoMonolithic` multi-tenant instance, set a time range and the maximum number of traces to return.
. Use the filter bar to select traces by attribute (service name, span name, etc.). For advanced filtering requirements, you can modify the TraceQL directly by clicking on the `Show query` link.
+
The traces are displayed on a scatter-plot showing the trace start time, duration, and number of spans. Underneath the scatter plot, there is a list of traces showing information such as the `Trace Name`, number of `Spans`, and `Duration`. 
+
The backend searches the object storage and ingester caches in parallel, and stops the search when the requested number of traces are found. Therefore, the search result is a random sample of all traces which match the search parameters, and the returned traces are not ordered in any way.
. Click on a trace name link.
+
The trace detail page for the selected trace contains a Gantt Chart of all of the spans within the trace. Select a span to show a breakdown of the configured attributes.
