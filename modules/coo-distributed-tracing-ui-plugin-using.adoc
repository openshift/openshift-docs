= Using the {coo-full} distributed tracing UI plugin

[role="_abstract"]
Visualizing traces in the distributed tracing UI in the {ocp-product-title} web console provides a user-friendly way of working with traces.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
* You have logged in to the {ocp-product-title} web console.
* You have installed the {coo-full}.
* You have installed the {coo-full} distributed tracing UI plugin.
* You have a `TempoStack` or `TempoMonolithic` multi-tenant instance in the cluster.

.Procedure

. In the {ocp-product-title} web console, click *Observe* → *Traces*.

. Select a *Tempo instance*. If selecting a multi-tenant instance, also select a tenant.

. Select a *Time range* and *Limit traces*.

. Use the two *Filter* drop-down menus to filter by an attribute:
** *Service Name*
** *Span Name*
** *Namespace*
** *Status*
** *Span Duration*
** *Trace Duration*
** *Custom attributes*
+
[TIP]
====
For more advanced filtering, click the *Show query* link and edit the TraceQL query.
====
+
As a result of your filter selections, a scatter plot visualizes traces with trace start time, duration, and number of spans.
+
Also, the traces are listed under the scatter plot, including trace details such as the *Trace Name*, number of *Spans*, and *Duration*. 
+
The back end searches both the object storage and ingester caches in parallel until the requested number of traces is found. The search results are a random and unordered sample of traces matching the search parameters.

. Select a trace to view a Gantt chart of its spans.

. In the Gantt chart, select a span to view its configured attributes.
