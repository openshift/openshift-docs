= About network observability per-tenant configuration

[role="_abstract"]
Per-tenant configuration allows project administrators to manage network traffic within their namespaces while cluster administrators maintain global governance.

The Network Observability Operator uses a hierarchical configuration model to support multi-tenancy. This architecture is beneficial for large-scale deployments and {hcp-capital} environments where individual teams require self-service visibility without cluster administrator intervention.

Global governance:: The cluster administrator manages the global `FlowCollector` resource. This resource defines the observability infrastructure and determines if per-tenant configuration is permitted.
Tenant autonomy:: The project administrator manages the `FlowCollectorSlice` resource. This namespace-scoped custom resource (CR) allows teams to define specific observability settings for their workloads.
