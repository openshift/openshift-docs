[id="serverless-target-utilization_{context}"]
= Concurrency target utilization

This value specifies the percentage of the concurrency limit that is actually targeted by the autoscaler. This is also known as specifying the _hotness_ at which a replica runs, which enables the autoscaler to scale up before the defined hard limit is reached.

For example, if the `containerConcurrency` value is set to 10, and the `target-utilization-percentage` value is set to 70 percent, the autoscaler creates a new replica when the average number of concurrent requests across all existing replicas reaches 7. Requests numbered 7 to 10 are still sent to the existing replicas, but additional replicas are started in anticipation of being required after the `containerConcurrency` value is reached.
