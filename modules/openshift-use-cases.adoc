== Use cases

Red Hat OpenShift is widely adopted across industries to support various use cases, enabling organizations to modernize applications, optimize infrastructure, and enhance operational efficiency.

OpenShift virtualization::

* Provides a unified platform for managing virtual machines (VMs) and containers in parallel, which streamlines operations and reduces complexity.
* Provides a robust infrastructure to scale VM workloads efficiently.
* Provides enhanced security features to protect VM environments, ensuring compliance and data integrity.

For detailed implementation guidelines and a sample architecture, refer to the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7067871[OpenShift Virtualization - Reference Implementation Guide]. This document offers best practices for deploying OpenShift as a hosting solution for virtualization workloads, designed for environments transitioning from platforms such as VMware Cloud Foundation, VMware vSphere Foundation, Red Hat Virtualization, and OpenStack to OpenShift Virtualization.

Application modernization including artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) operations::

* Enables containerization and refactoring of legacy applications.
* Preserves business logic while making applications cloud-ready and maintainable.
* Supports model training and inference workloads with standardized ML infrastructure.
* Seamlessly integrates with data science workflows.

Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud deployments::

* Provides a consistent platform across on-premises data centers and multiple public clouds.
* Helps avoid vendor lock-in and optimize workload placement.

DevOps enablement::

* Built-in continuous delivery and continuous integration (CI/CD) pipelines and GitOps workflows streamline software development.
* Offers developer self-service capabilities to accelerate software delivery.

Edge computing::

* Enables distributed computing closer to data sources in industries such as telecommunications, retail, and manufacturing.
* Supports lightweight deployment patterns, including three-node clusters, single-node clusters and Red Hat Device Edge or MicroShift.
* Provides support for on-premises deployments.

Regulatory compliance::

Provides robust security features to meet compliance requirements for financial services, healthcare, and government agencies.

Microservices architecture::

Supports cloud-native application development using service mesh, API management, and serverless capabilities.

Enterprise SaaS delivery::

* Facilitates multi-tenant SaaS application deployment with consistent operations.
* Includes features like Hosted Control Planes, cluster-as-a-service, and fleet-level management with Advanced Cluster Management (ACM) and Advanced Cluster Security (ACS).
