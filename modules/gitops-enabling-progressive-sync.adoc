= Enabling Progressive Sync

Progressive Sync is not enabled by default. You must explicitly enable this feature for the `ApplicationSet` controller in {gitops-shortname}. You can enable this feature using either one of the following two methods:

. Add the `extraCommandArgs` argument to the Argo CD CR
. Set the `env` environment variable in the Argo CD CR
