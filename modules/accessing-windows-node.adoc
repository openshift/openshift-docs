= Accessing a Windows node

[role="_abstract"]
Windows nodes cannot be accessed using the `oc debug node` command; the command requires running a privileged pod on the node, which is not yet supported for Windows. Instead, a Windows node can be accessed using a secure shell (SSH) or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). An SSH bastion is required for both methods.
