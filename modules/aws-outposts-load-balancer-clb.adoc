= Using AWS Classic Load Balancers in an AWS VPC cluster extended into an Outpost

AWS Outposts infrastructure cannot run AWS Classic Load Balancers, but Classic Load Balancers in the AWS VPC cluster can target edge compute nodes in the Outpost if edge and cloud-based subnets are in the same availability zone.
As a result, Classic Load Balancers on the VPC cluster might schedule pods on either of these node types.

Scheduling the workloads on edge compute nodes and cloud-based compute nodes can introduce latency.
If you want to prevent a Classic Load Balancer in the VPC cluster from targeting Outpost edge compute nodes, you can apply labels to the cloud-based compute nodes and configure the Classic Load Balancer to only schedule on nodes with the applied labels.

[NOTE]
====
If you do not need to prevent a Classic Load Balancer in the VPC cluster from targeting Outpost edge compute nodes, you do not need to complete these steps.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have extended an AWS VPC cluster into an Outpost.

* You have access to the cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.

* You have installed the {oc-first}.

* You have created a user workload in the Outpost with tolerations that match the taints for your edge compute machines.

.Procedure

. Optional: Verify that the edge compute nodes have the `location=outposts` label by running the following command and verifying that the output includes only the edge compute nodes in your Outpost:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes -l location=outposts
----

. Label the cloud-based compute nodes in the VPC cluster with a key-value pair by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ for NODE in $(oc get node -l node-role.kubernetes.io/worker --no-headers | grep -v outposts | awk '{print$1}'); do oc label node $NODE <key_name>=<value>; done
----
+
where `<key_name>=<value>` is the label you want to use to distinguish cloud-based compute nodes.
+
.Example output
[source,text]
----
node1.example.com labeled
node2.example.com labeled
node3.example.com labeled
----

. Optional: Verify that the cloud-based compute nodes have the specified label by running the following command and confirming that the output includes all cloud-based compute nodes in your VPC cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes -l <key_name>=<value>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                   STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
node1.example.com      Ready     worker    7h        v1.29.4
node2.example.com      Ready     worker    7h        v1.29.4
node3.example.com      Ready     worker    7h        v1.29.4
----

. Configure the Classic Load Balancer service by adding the cloud-based subnet information to the `annotations` field of the `Service` manifest:
+
.Example service configuration
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: <application_name>
  name: <application_name>
  namespace: <application_namespace>
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-subnets: <aws_subnet> # <1>
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-target-node-labels: <key_name>=<value> # <2>
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: <application_name>
  type: LoadBalancer
----
<1> Specify the subnet ID for the AWS VPC cluster.
<2> Specify the key-value pair that matches the pair in the node label.

. Create the `Service` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <file_name>.yaml
----

.Verification

. Verify the status of the `service` resource to show the host of the provisioned Classic Load Balancer by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ HOST=$(oc get service <application_name> -n <application_namespace> --template='{{(index .status.loadBalancer.ingress 0).hostname}}')
----

. Verify the status of the provisioned Classic Load Balancer host by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl $HOST
----

. In the AWS console, verify that only the labeled instances appear as the targeted instances for the load balancer.
