= Configuring secrets for Alertmanager

The {product-title} monitoring stack includes Alertmanager, which routes alerts from Prometheus to endpoint receivers.
If you need to authenticate with a receiver so that Alertmanager can send alerts to it, you can configure Alertmanager to use a secret that contains authentication credentials for the receiver.

For example, you can configure Alertmanager to use a secret to authenticate with an endpoint receiver that requires a certificate issued by a private Certificate Authority (CA).
You can also configure Alertmanager to use a secret to authenticate with a receiver that requires a password file for Basic HTTP authentication.
In either case, authentication details are contained in the `Secret` object rather than in the `ConfigMap` object.
