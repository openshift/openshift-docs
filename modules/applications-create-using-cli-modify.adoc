= Modifying application creation

The `new-app` command generates {product-title} objects that build, deploy, and
run the application that is created. Normally, these objects are created in the
current project and assigned names that are derived from the input source
repositories or the input images. However, with `new-app` you can modify this
behavior.

|Object |Description

|`BuildConfig`
|A `BuildConfig` is created for each source repository that is specified in the
command line. The `BuildConfig` specifies the strategy to use, the source
location, and the build output location.

|`ImageStreams`
|For `BuildConfig`, two `ImageStreams` are usually created. One
represents the input image. With `Source` builds, this is the builder image.
ifndef::openshift-online[]
With `Docker` builds, this is the *FROM* image.
endif::[]
The second one represents the output image. If a container image was specified
as input to `new-app`, then an imagestream is created for that image as well.

|`DeploymentConfig`
|A `DeploymentConfig` is created either to deploy the output of a build, or a
specified image. The `new-app` command creates `emptyDir` volumes for all Docker
volumes that are specified in containers included in the resulting
`DeploymentConfig`.

|`Service`
|The `new-app` command attempts to detect exposed ports in input images. It
uses the lowest numeric exposed port to generate a service that exposes that
port. In order to expose a different port, after `new-app` has completed, simply
use the `oc expose` command to generate additional services.

|Other
|Other objects can be generated when instantiating templates, according to the
 template.

== Specifying environment variables

When generating applications from a template, source, or an image, you can use
the `-e|--env` argument to pass environment variables to the application
container at run time:

----
$ oc new-app openshift/postgresql-92-centos7 \
    -e POSTGRESQL_USER=user \
    -e POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=db \
    -e POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=password
----

The variables can also be read from file using the `--env-file` argument:

----
$ cat postgresql.env
POSTGRESQL_USER=user
POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=db
POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=password
$ oc new-app openshift/postgresql-92-centos7 --env-file=postgresql.env
----

Additionally, environment variables can be given on standard input by using
`--env-file=-`:

----
$ cat postgresql.env | oc new-app openshift/postgresql-92-centos7 --env-file=-
----

[NOTE]
====
Any `BuildConfig` objects created as part of `new-app` processing are not
updated with environment variables passed with the `-e|--env` or `--env-file` argument.
====

== Specifying build environment variables

When generating applications from a template, source, or an image, you can use
the `--build-env` argument to pass environment variables to the build container
at run time:

----
$ oc new-app openshift/ruby-23-centos7 \
    --build-env HTTP_PROXY=http://myproxy.net:1337/ \
    --build-env GEM_HOME=~/.gem
----

The variables can also be read from a file using the `--build-env-file` argument:

----
$ cat ruby.env
HTTP_PROXY=http://myproxy.net:1337/
GEM_HOME=~/.gem
$ oc new-app openshift/ruby-23-centos7 --build-env-file=ruby.env
----

Additionally, environment variables can be given on standard input by using
`--build-env-file=-`:

----
$ cat ruby.env | oc new-app openshift/ruby-23-centos7 --build-env-file=-
----

== Specifying labels

When generating applications from source, images, or templates, you
can use the `-l|--label` argument to add labels to the created objects. Labels
make it easy to collectively select, configure, and delete objects associated
with the application.

----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world -l name=hello-world
----

== Viewing the output without creation

To see a dry-run of running the `new-app` command, you can use the `-o|--output`
argument with a `yaml` or `json` value. You can then use the output to preview
the objects that are created or redirect it to a file that you can edit.
After you are satisfied, you can use `oc create` to create the {product-title}
objects.

To output `new-app` artifacts to a file, edit them, then create them:

----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world \
    -o yaml > myapp.yaml
$ vi myapp.yaml
$ oc create -f myapp.yaml
----

== Creating objects with different names

Objects created by `new-app` are normally named after the source repository, or
the image used to generate them. You can set the name of the objects produced by
adding a `--name` flag to the command:

----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world --name=myapp
----

== Creating objects in a different project

Normally, `new-app` creates objects in the current project. However, you can
create objects in a different project by using the `-n|--namespace` argument:

----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world -n myproject
----

== Creating multiple objects

The `new-app` command allows creating multiple applications specifying multiple
parameters to `new-app`. Labels specified in the command line apply to all
objects created by the single command. Environment variables apply to all
components created from source or images.

To create an application from a source repository and a Docker Hub image:

----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world mysql
----

[NOTE]
====
If a source code repository and a builder image are specified as separate
arguments, `new-app` uses the builder image as the builder for the source code
repository. If this is not the intent, specify the required builder image for
the source using the `~` separator.
====

== Grouping images and source in a single Pod

The `new-app` command allows deploying multiple images together in a single Pod.
In order to specify which images to group together, use the `+` separator. The
`--group` command line argument can also be used to specify the images that should
be grouped together. To group the image built from a source repository with
other images, specify its builder image in the group:

----
$ oc new-app ruby+mysql
----

To deploy an image built from source and an external image together:

----
$ oc new-app \
    ruby~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world \
    mysql \
    --group=ruby+mysql
----

== Searching for images, templates, and other inputs

To search for images, templates, and other inputs for the `oc new-app` command,
add the `--search` and `--list` flags. For example, to find all of the images or
templates that include PHP:

----
$ oc new-app --search php
----
