= Early access releases

[role="_abstract"]
You can gain access to builds in development by subscribing to the *candidate* update channel for your version of {VirtProductName}.

These releases have not been fully tested by Red{nbsp}Hat and are not supported, but you can use them on non-production clusters to test capabilities and bug fixes being developed for that version.

The *stable* channel, which matches the underlying {product-title} version and is fully tested, is suitable for production systems. You can switch between the *stable* and *candidate* channels in Operator Hub. However, updating from a *candidate* channel release to a *stable* channel release is not tested by Red{nbsp}Hat.

Some candidate releases are promoted to the *stable* channel. However, releases present only in *candidate* channels might not contain all features that will be made generally available (GA), and some features in candidate builds might be removed before GA. Additionally, candidate releases might not offer update paths to later GA releases. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
The candidate channel is only suitable for testing purposes where destroying and recreating a cluster is acceptable.
