On some clusters, there may be more than one route table for a particular VPC.
Select the private one that has a number of explicitly associated subnets.

. Select the *Routes* tab, then *Edit*.
. Enter the Customer VPC CIDR block in the *Destination* text box.
. Enter the Peering Connection ID in the *Target* text box.
