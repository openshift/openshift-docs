to communicate across the peering connection.

. Log in to the AWS Web Console for the OSD AWS Account.
. Navigate to the *VPC Service*, then *Route Tables*.
. Select the Route Table for the {product-title} Cluster VPC.

[NOTE]
====
On some clusters, there may be more than one route table for a particular VPC.
Select the private one that has a number of explicitly associated subnets.
====

. Select the *Routes* tab, then *Edit*.
. Enter the Customer VPC CIDR block in the *Destination* text box.
. Enter the Peering Connection ID in the *Target* text box.
. Click *Save*.

. You must complete the same process with the other VPC's CIDR block:
.. Log into the Customer AWS Web Console → *VPC Service* → *Route Tables*.
.. Select the Route Table for your VPC.
.. Select the *Routes* tab, then *Edit*.
.. Enter the {product-title} Cluster VPC CIDR block in the *Destination* text box.
