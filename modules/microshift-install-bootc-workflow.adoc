= The image mode for {op-system-base} with {microshift-short} workflow

To use image mode for {op-system-base}, ensure that the following resources are available:

* A {op-system-base} {op-system-version} host with an active Red{nbsp}Hat subscription for building {microshift-short} bootc images.
* A remote registry for storing and accessing bootc images.
* You can use image mode for RHEL with a {microshift-short} cluster on AArch64 or x86_64 system architectures.

The workflow for using image mode with {microshift-short} includes the following steps:

. Find and use a prebuilt {microshift-short} container image to install {op-system-base-full}.
. Build a custom {microshift-short} container image if the prebuilt {microshift-short} container image requires customization.
. Run the container image.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `rpm-ostree` file system is not supported in image mode. Do not use the `rpm-ostree` file system to modify deployments that use image mode.
