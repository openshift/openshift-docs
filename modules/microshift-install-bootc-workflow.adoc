= The image mode for {op-system-base} with {microshift-short} workflow

Before you use {op-system-image}, ensure that the following resources are available:

* A {op-system-base} {op-system-version} host with an active Red{nbsp}Hat subscription for building {microshift-short} bootc images.
* A remote registry for storing and accessing `rhel-bootc` images.
* An AArch64 or x86_64 system architecture.

The workflow for using {op-system-image} with {microshift-short} includes the following steps:

. Find and use a prebuilt {microshift-short} container image to install {op-system-base}.
. If the prebuilt {microshift-short} container image requires customization, build a custom {microshift-short} container image.
. Run the container image.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `rpm-ostree` file system used by {op-system-ostree} is not supported in {op-system-image}. Do not use the `rpm-ostree` file system to modify deployments that use {op-system-image}.
