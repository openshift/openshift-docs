= The PolicyGenTemplate

The `PolicyGenTemplate.yaml` file is a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) that tells PolicyGen where to locate the generated policies on the cluster and the items that need to be defined. The following example shows the `PolicyGenTemplate.yaml` file:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policyGenerator/v1
kind: PolicyGenTemplate
metadata:
  # The name will be used to generate the placementBinding and placementRule names as ex: policyGenTemp-placementBinding and policyGenTemp-placementRule
  name: "policyGenTemp"
  namespace: "policy-templates"
  labels:
    # Set common to true if the generated policies will be applied for all clusters.
    common: false
    # Set groupName value (ex:group-du) if the generated policies will be applied for a group of clusters.
    groupName: "N/A"
    siteName: "N/A"
    # Set siteName value (ex:prod-cluster) if the generated policies will be applied for a specific cluster.
    mcp: "N/A"
sourceFiles:
    # (mandatory) The fileName values must be same as file name in the sourcePolicies dir without .yaml extension ex: SriovNetwork
  - fileName: "N/A"

    # (mandatory) The policyName will be used with common|{metadata.labels.groupName}|{metadata.labels.siteName}
    # to set the generated policy name. ex: group1-ptp-policy or common-sriov-sub-policy
    # When a policy is propagated to a managed cluster, the replicated policy is named namespaceName.policyName.
    # When you create a policy, make sure that the length of the namespaceName.policyName must not exceed 63 characters
    # due to the Kubernetes limit for object names.
    # The namespace.names that policy generator use are: common-sub, groups-sub and sites-sub
    policyName: "N/A"

    # (optional) The name will be used to set the generated custom resource metadata.name
    # if name is defined as N/A, "" or not set the name value exist in the sourcePolicies/{fileName} will be used.
    name: "N/A"

    # (optional) spec must contain the values that is needed to be set in the source policy following the exact same path ex:
    # sriovnetwork.spec as follow
    # spec:
    #  resourceName: du_fh
    #  vlan: 140
    #
    # If the spec is not defined, the defined spec in the sourcePolicies/{fileName} will be carried out to
    # the generated custom resource.
    # If Any of the spec items defined in the source file as variable start with $, it will be deleted
    # from the generated spec items if it is not setted.
    spec: "N/A"

    # (optional) data must contain the values that is needed to be set in the source policy following the exact same path ex:
    # configMap.data as follow
    # data:
    #   rules1.properties: |
    #   name: cnf*
    #   labels:
    #    - node-role.kubernetes.io/worker-du
    #
    # If the data is not defined, the defined data in the sourcePolicies/{fileName} will be carried out to
    # the generated custom resource.
    # If Any of the data items defined in the source file as variable start with $, it will be deleted
    # from the generated data items if it is not setted.
    data: "N/A"

The `group-du-ranGen.yaml` file defines a group of policies under a group named `group-du`. It defines a MachineConfigPool `worker-du` that is used as the node selector for any other policy defined in `sourceFiles`. An ACM policy is generated for every source file that exists in `sourceFiles`. And, a single placement binding and placement rule is generated to apply the cluster selection rule for group-du policies.

Using the source file `PtpConfigSlave.yaml` as an example,  the PtpConfigSlave has a definition of a PtpConfig custom resource. The generated policy for the PtpConfigSlave example is named `group-du-ptp-config-policy`. The PtpConfig custom resource defined in the generated `group-du-ptp-config-policy` is named `du-ptp-slave`. The `spec` defined in `PtpConfigSlave.yaml` is placed under `du-ptp-slave` along with the other `spec` items defined under the source file.

The following example shows the `group-du-ptp-config-policy`:
