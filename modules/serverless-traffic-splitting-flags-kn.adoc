[id="serverless-traffic-splitting-flags-kn-precedence_{context}"]
== Multiple flags and order precedence

All traffic-related flags can be specified using a single `kn service update` command. `kn` defines the precedence of these flags. The order of the flags specified when using the command is not taken into account.

The precedence of the flags as they are evaluated by `kn` are:

. `--untag`: All the referenced revisions with this flag are removed from the traffic block.
. `--tag`: Revisions are tagged as specified in the traffic block.
. `--traffic`: The referenced revisions are assigned a portion of the traffic split.

You can add tags to revisions and then split traffic according to the tags you have set.
