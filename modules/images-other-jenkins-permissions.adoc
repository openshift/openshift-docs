= Jenkins permissions

If in the ConfigMap the `<serviceAccount>` element of the Pod Template XML is
the {product-title} Service Account used for the resulting pod, the service
account credentials are mounted into the pod. The permissions are associated
with the service account and control which operations against the
{product-title} master are allowed from the pod.

Consider the following scenario with service accounts used for the pod, which
is launched by the Kubernetes Plug-in that runs in the {product-title} Jenkins
image:

If you use the example template for Jenkins that is provided by {product-title},
the `jenkins` service account is defined with the `edit` role for the project
Jenkins runs in, and the master Jenkins Pod has that service account
mounted.

The two default Maven and NodeJS Pod Templates that are injected into the Jenkins
configuration are also set to use the same service account as the Jenkins master.

* Any Pod templates that are automatically discovered by the OpenShift Sync
plug-in because their imagestreams or imagestreamtags have the required label or
annotations are configured to use the Jenkins master's service account as their
service account.
* For the other ways you can provide a Pod Template definition into Jenkins and
the Kubernetes plug-in, you have to explicitly specify the service account to
use. Those other ways include the Jenkins console, the `podTemplate` pipeline DSL
that is provided by the Kubernetes plug-in, or labeling a ConfigMap whose data
is the XML configuration for a Pod Template.
* If you do not specify a value for the service account, the `default` service
account is used.
* Ensure that whatever service account is used has the necessary
permissions, roles, and so on defined within {product-title} to manipulate
whatever projects you choose to manipulate from the within the pod.
