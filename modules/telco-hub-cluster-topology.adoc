= Cluster topology

In production settings, the {product-title} hub cluster must be highly available to maintain high availability of the management functions.

Limits and requirements::
Use a highly available cluster topology for the hub cluster, for example:
* Compact (3 nodes combined control plane + N compute nodes)
* Standard (3 control plane nodes + N compute nodes)

Engineering considerations::
* In non-production settings, a {sno} cluster can be used for limited hub cluster functionality.
* Certain capabilities, for example, {rh-storage} are not supported on {sno}.
In this configuration some hub cluster features might not be available.
* The number of optional compute nodes can vary depending on the scale of the specific use case.
* Compute nodes can be added later as required.
