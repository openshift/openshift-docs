= Assigning an SR-IOV network to a VRF

As a cluster administrator, you can assign an SR-IOV network interface to your VRF domain by using the CNI VRF plug-in.

To do this, add the VRF configuration to the optional `metaPlugins` parameter of the `SriovNetwork` resource.

[id="cnf-creating-an-additional-sriov-network-with-vrf-plug-in_{context}"]
== Creating an additional SR-IOV network attachment with the CNI VRF plug-in

The SR-IOV Network Operator manages additional network definitions. When you specify an additional SR-IOV network to create, the SR-IOV Network Operator creates the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` custom resource (CR) automatically.

[NOTE]
====
Do not edit `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` custom resources that the SR-IOV Network Operator manages. Doing so might disrupt network traffic on your additional network.
====

.Prerequisites
* Install the {product-title} CLI (oc).
* Log in to the {product-title} cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

.Procedure
. Create the `SriovNetwork` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create sriovnetwork.openshift.io cluster
----
. Extend the CR that you are creating by adding the `metaPlugins` configuration for the additional network you are creating, as in the following example CR.
. Save your changes and quit the text editor to commit your changes. The following YAML configures the `SriovNetwork` object:
+

    }
----
<1> `type` must be set to `vrf`.
<2> `vrfname` is the name of the VRF that the interface is assigned to. If it does not exist in the pod, it is created.

.Verify the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CR is successfully created
Confirm that the SR-IOV Network Operator created the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CR by running the following command. Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace that you specified when configuring the network attachment. There might be a delay before the SR-IOV Network Operator creates the CR.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get network-attachment-definitions -n <namespace>
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                            AGE

.Verifying that the additional SR-IOV network attachment is successful

To verify that the VRF CNI is correctly configured and the additional SR-IOV network attachment is attached, do the following:

. Create an SR-IOV network that uses the VRF CNI.
. Assign the network to a pod.
. Verify that the pod network attachment is connected to the SR-IOV additional network. SSH into the pod and run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ip vrf show
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----

----
. Confirm the VRF interface is master of the secondary interface:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ip link

+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
