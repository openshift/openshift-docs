[id="cnf-assigning-a-sriov-network-to-a-vrf_{context}"]
= Assigning an SR-IOV network to a VRF

As a cluster administrator, you can assign an SR-IOV network interface to your VRF domain by using the CNI VRF plugin.

To do this, add the VRF configuration to the optional `metaPlugins` parameter of the `SriovNetwork` resource.

[NOTE]
====
Applications that use VRFs need to bind to a specific device. The common usage is to use the `SO_BINDTODEVICE` option for a socket. `SO_BINDTODEVICE` binds the socket to a device that is specified in the passed interface name, for example, `eth1`. To use `SO_BINDTODEVICE`, the application must have `CAP_NET_RAW` capabilities.

Using a VRF through the `ip vrf exec` command is not supported in {product-title} pods. To use VRF, bind applications directly to the VRF interface.

== Creating an additional SR-IOV network attachment with the CNI VRF plugin

The SR-IOV Network Operator manages additional network definitions. When you specify an additional SR-IOV network to create, the SR-IOV Network Operator creates the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` custom resource (CR) automatically.

[NOTE]
====
Do not edit `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` custom resources that the SR-IOV Network Operator manages. Doing so might disrupt network traffic on your additional network.
====

To create an additional SR-IOV network attachment with the CNI VRF plugin, perform the following procedure.

.Prerequisites

* Install the {product-title} CLI (oc).
* Log in to the {product-title} cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

.Procedure

. Create the `SriovNetwork` custom resource (CR) for the additional SR-IOV network attachment and insert the `metaPlugins` configuration, as in the following example CR. Save the YAML as the file `sriov-network-attachment.yaml`.

<1> `type` must be set to `vrf`.
<2> `vrfname` is the name of the VRF that the interface is assigned to. If it does not exist in the pod, it is created.

$ oc create -f sriov-network-attachment.yaml

.Verifying that the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CR is successfully created

* Confirm that the SR-IOV Network Operator created the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CR by running the following command.

$ oc get network-attachment-definitions -n <namespace> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace that you specified when configuring the network attachment, for example, `additional-sriov-network-1`.

There might be a delay before the SR-IOV Network Operator creates the CR.

.Verifying that the additional SR-IOV network attachment is successful

To verify that the VRF CNI is correctly configured and the additional SR-IOV network attachment is attached, do the following:

. Create an SR-IOV network that uses the VRF CNI.
. Assign the network to a pod.
. Verify that the pod network attachment is connected to the SR-IOV additional network. Remote shell into the pod and run the following command:
+

$ ip vrf show
