= Assigning an SR-IOV network to a VRF

As a cluster administrator, you can assign an SR-IOV network interface to your VRF domain by using the CNI VRF plugin.

To do this, add the VRF configuration to the optional `metaPlugins` parameter of the `SriovNetwork` resource.

[NOTE]
====
Applications that use VRFs need to bind to a specific device. The common usage is to use the `SO_BINDTODEVICE` option for a socket. `SO_BINDTODEVICE` binds the socket to a device that is specified in the passed interface name, for example, `eth1`. To use `SO_BINDTODEVICE`, the application must have `CAP_NET_RAW` capabilities.

Using a VRF through the `ip vrf exec` command is not supported in {product-title} pods. To use VRF, bind applications directly to the VRF interface.
