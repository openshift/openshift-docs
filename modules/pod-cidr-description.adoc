= Pod CIDR

[role="_abstract"]
To allocate internal network addresses for cluster workloads in {product-title}, specify an IP address range in the pod Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) field. Defining this range ensures that pods can communicate with each other reliably without overlapping with the node or service networks.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The pod CIDR is the same as the `clusterNetwork` CIDR and the cluster CIDR.
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
ifdef::openshift-rosa,openshift-rosa-hcp,openshift-dedicated[]
Red{nbsp}Hat recommends, but this task is not mandatory, that the address block is the same between clusters. This does not create IP address conflicts.
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-rosa-hcp,openshift-dedicated[]
The range must be large enough to accommodate your workload. The address block must not overlap with any external service accessed from within the cluster. The default is `10.128.0.0/14`.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
You can expand the range after cluster installation.
