= Deploying an egress router pod in HTTP proxy mode

In _HTTP proxy mode_, an egress router pod runs as an HTTP proxy on port `8080`. This mode only works for clients that are connecting to HTTP-based or HTTPS-based services, but usually requires fewer changes to the client pods to get them to work. Many programs can be told to use an HTTP proxy by setting an environment variable.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Create an egress router pod.

. To ensure that other pods can find the IP address of the egress router pod, create a service to point to the egress router pod, as in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: egress-1
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http-proxy
    port: 8080 <1>
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    name: egress-1
----
<1> Ensure the `http` port is set to `8080`.

. To configure the client pod (not the egress proxy pod) to use the HTTP proxy, set the `http_proxy` or `https_proxy` variables:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: app-1
  labels:
    name: app-1
spec:
  containers:
    env:
    - name: http_proxy
      value: http://egress-1:8080/ <1>
    - name: https_proxy
      value: http://egress-1:8080/
    ...
----
<1> The service created in the previous step.
+
[NOTE]
====
Using the `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` environment variables is not necessary for all setups. If the above does not create a working setup, then consult the documentation for the tool or software you are running in the pod.
