= Subscription

A Subscription represents an intention to install an Operator. It is the custom
resource that relates an Operator to a CatalogSource. Subscriptions describe
which channel of an Operator package to subscribe to, and whether to perform
updates automatically or manually. If set to automatic, the Subscription ensures
OLM manages and upgrades the Operator to ensure that the latest version is
always running in the cluster.

.Example Subscription
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: my-operator
  namespace: operators
spec:
  channel: stable
  name: my-operator
  source: my-catalog
  sourceNamespace: operators
----

This Subscription object defines the name and namespace of the Operator, as well
as the catalog from which the Operator data can be found. The channel, such as
`alpha`, `beta`, or `stable`, helps determine which Operator stream should be
installed from the CatalogSource.

In addition to being easily visible from the {product-title} web console, it is
possible to identify when there is a newer version of an Operator available by
inspecting the status of the Operator's Subscription. The value associated with
the `currentCSV` field is the newest version that is known to OLM, and
`installedCSV` is the version that is installed on the cluster.
