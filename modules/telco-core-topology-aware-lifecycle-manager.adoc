New in this release::
No reference design updates in this release.

Description::
{cgu-operator-full} is an Operator which runs only on the hub cluster.
{cgu-operator} manages how changes including cluster and Operator upgrades, configurations, and so on, are rolled out to managed clusters in the network.
{cgu-operator} has the following core features:
* Provides sequenced updates of cluster configurations and upgrades ({product-title} and Operators) as defined by cluster policies.
* Provides for deferred application of cluster updates.
* Supports progressive rollout of policy updates to sets of clusters in user configurable batches.
* Allows for per-cluster actions by adding `ztp-done` or similar user-defined labels to clusters.

Limits and requirements::
* Supports concurrent cluster deployments in batches of 400.

Engineering considerations::
* Only policies with the `ran.openshift.io/ztp-deploy-wave` annotation are applied by {cgu-operator} during initial cluster installation.
* Any policy can be remediated by {cgu-operator} under control of a user created `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR.
