= Disconnected environment

Description::
{rds-caps} clusters are expected to be installed in networks without direct access to the internet. All container images needed to install, configure, and operator the cluster must be available in a disconnected registry. This includes {product-title} images, day-2 Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) Operator images, and application workload images. The use of a disconnected environment provides multiple benefits, for example:

* Limiting access to the cluster for security
* Curated content: The registry is populated based on curated and approved updates for the clusters

Limits and requirements::

* A unique name is required for all custom CatalogSources. Do not reuse the default catalog names.
* A valid time source must be configured as part of cluster installation.

Engineering considerations::
