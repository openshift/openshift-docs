The basic configuration for the Network Operator is set in the
`Network.config.openshift.io` object. The object is automatically created by the
openshift-installer. All fields for the `spec` field are mandatory. The Network
Operator does not allow changes to these values in a running cluster.

The following CR object displays the default network configuration:

<1> A block of IP addresses from which pod IPs are allocated. {product-title}
uses CIDR to allocate IP addresses. The 'OpenShiftSDN' network plug-in supports
multiple cluster networks.
<2> The subnet prefix length to assign to each individual node. For example, if
`hostPrefix` is set to `23`, then each node is assigned a `/23` subnet out of
the given `cidr`, allowing for 510 (2^(32 - 23) - 2) pod IP addresses.
<3> The Network plug-in to deploy. `OpenShiftSDN` is the only plug-in that is
supported in {product-title} {product-version}.
<4> A block of IP addresses for services. `OpenShiftSDN` allows only one
`serviceNetwork` block.
