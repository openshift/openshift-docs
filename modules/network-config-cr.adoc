= Cluster network configuration custom resource

The basic configuration for the `Network Operator` is set in the `Network`
configuration in a `config.openshift.io` Custom Resource (CR) object. All fields
in the `Network` configuration are mandatory. The Network Operator does not
allow changes to these values in a running cluster.

The following CR object displays the default `Network` configuration:

.Network.config.openshift.io CR

<1> `cidr`: A block of IP addresses from which pod IPs are allocated.
{product-title} uses CIDR to allocate IP addresses. The 'OpenShiftSDN' network
plug-in supports multiple `clusterNetworks`. The address blocks for multiple
`clusterNetworks` must not overlap. Select address pools large enough to fit
your anticipated workload.
<2> `hostPrefix`: TThe subnet prefix length to assign to each individual node.
For example, if `hostPrefix` is set to `23`, then each node will be assigned a
`/23` subnet out of the given `cidr`, allowing for 510 (2^(32 - 23) - 2) pod
IPs.
<3> `NetworkType`: the Network plug-in to deploy. `OpenShiftSDN` is the only
plug-in that is supported in {product-title} {product-version}.
<4> `serviceNetwork`: A block of IP addresses for services. `OpenShiftSDN`
allows only one `serviceNetwork` block.
