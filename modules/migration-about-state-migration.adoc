= State migration

You can use {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) to migrate an application's state.

State migration copies selected persistent volume claims (PVCs) and Kubernetes objects that store an application's state.

If you have a CI/CD pipeline, you can migrate stateless components by deploying them on the target cluster. Then you can migrate the application's state by using {mtc-short}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not use state migration to migrate a namespace.
