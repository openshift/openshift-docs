== Fixed issues

* Before this update, resource limits were set on the operator container as a recommended practice. However, these limits caused functional issues on clusters with a large number of secrets and config maps because the operator manager, a controller that manages the lifecycle of Argo CD components, required more memory than allowed by these limits. With this update, the resource limits set on the manager container have been removed to minimize the impact on functionality. Efforts are focused to optimize memory consumption for future releases. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-5665[GITOPS-5665]

* Before this update, Argo CD could not obtain the appropriate transport layer security (TLS) certificate for Helm Open Container Initiative (OCI) registries when the URL included a path or port number. With this update, a fix is introduced in upstream Argo CD to correctly parse the URL and return a valid certificate. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-5081[GITOPS-5081]

* Before this update, you could not log in to the Argo CD web console UI on a Red Hat OpenShift Service on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cluster that includes a {gitops-shortname} Operator and an Argo CD instance configured with Dex-based SSO, after the cluster resumed from hibernation. The login screen would display an error indicating an invalid redirect Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) in the Dex configuration. This update fixes the issue by ensuring that the correct Dex redirect URL is updated in the Argo CD configuration whenever the Argo CD server route is modified. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-4358[GITOPS-4358]

[id="additional-configurations-for-cluster-scoped-rollouts-instance-installation_{context}"]
=== Additional configurations for cluster-scoped rollouts instance installation

* When you upgrade to {gitops-title} v1.14, if you want to create the cluster-scoped rollouts installation outside the default installation namespace, `openshift-gitops`, you must host it in the `CLUSTER_SCOPED_ARGO_ROLLOUTS_NAMESPACES` environment variable of the `Subscription` resource. The {gitops-title} Operator does not support cluster-scoped rollouts installation if the namespace is not defined in the `CLUSTER_SCOPED_ARGO_ROLLOUTS_NAMESPACES` environment variable.
+
In previous versions of {gitops-title}, Argo Rollouts used the `NAMESPACE_SCOPED_ARGO_ROLLOUTS_NAMESPACES` environment variable of the `Subscription` resource to check if you can create a cluster-scoped rollouts instance in the user-defined namespace. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-5640[GITOPS-5640]
+
[NOTE]
====
The cluster-scoped rollouts installation functionality change does not impact the installation behavior of the namespace-scoped rollouts installation.

<1> Specify this value to enable or disable the cluster-scoped installation. If the value is set to `'false'`, it means that the you have enabled cluster-scoped installation. If it is set to `'true'`, it means that you have enabled namespace-scoped installation. If the value is empty, it is set to `false`.
<2> Specifies a comma-separated list of namespaces that can host a cluster-scoped Argo CD instance, for example `test-123-cluster-scoped,test-456-cluster-scoped`.
