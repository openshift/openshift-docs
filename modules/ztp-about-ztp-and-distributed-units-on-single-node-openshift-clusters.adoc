= About ZTP and distributed units on single nodes

You can install a distributed unit (DU) on a single node at scale with {rh-rhacm-first} (ACM) using the assisted installer (AI) and the policy generator with core-reduction technology enabled. The DU installation is done using zero touch provisioning (ZTP) in a disconnected environment.

ACM manages clusters in a hub and spoke architecture, where a single hub cluster manages many spoke clusters. ACM applies radio access network (RAN) policies from predefined custom resources (CRs). Hub clusters running ACM provision and deploy the spoke clusters using ZTP and AI. DU installation follows the AI installation of {product-title} on a single node.

The AI service handles provisioning of {product-title} on single nodes running on bare metal. ACM ships with and deploys the assisted installer when the `MultiClusterHub` custom resource is installed.

With ZTP and AI, you can provision {product-title} single nodes to run your DUs at scale. A high level overview of ZTP for distributed units in a disconnected environment is as follows:

* A hub cluster running ACM manages a disconnected internal registry that mirrors the {product-title} release images. The internal registry is used to provision the spoke single nodes.

* You manage the bare metal host machines for your DUs in an inventory file that uses YAML for formatting. You store the inventory file in a Git repository.


* You install the DU bare metal host machines on site, and make the hosts ready for provisioning. To be ready for provisioning, the following is required for each bare metal host:

** Network connectivity - including DNS for your network. Hosts should be reachable through the hub and managed spoke clusters. Ensure there is layer 3 connectivity between the hub and the host where you want to install your hub cluster.

** Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) details for each host - ZTP uses BMC details to connect the URL and credentials for accessing the BMC.
Create spoke cluster definition CRs. These define the relevant elements for the managed clusters. Required
CRs are as follows:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Custom Resource | Description

|Namespace
|Namespace for the managed single node cluster.

|BMCSecret CR
|Credentials for the host BMC.

|Image Pull Secret CR
|Pull secret for the disconnected registry.

|AgentClusterInstall
|Specifies the single node cluster's configuration such as networking, number of supervisor (control plane) nodes, and so on.

|ClusterDeployment
|Defines the cluster name, domain, and other details.

|KlusterletAddonConfig
|Manages installation and termination of add-ons on the ManagedCluster for ACM.

|ManagedCluster
|Describes the managed cluster for ACM.

|InfraEnv
|Describes the installation ISO to be mounted on the destination node that the assisted installer service creates.
This is the final step of the manifest creation phase.

|BareMetalHost
|Describes the details of the bare metal host, including BMC and credentials details.
|===

* When a change is detected in the host inventory repository, a host management event is triggered to provision the new or updated host.

* The host is provisioned. When the host is provisioned and successfully rebooted, the host agent reports `Ready` status to the hub cluster.
