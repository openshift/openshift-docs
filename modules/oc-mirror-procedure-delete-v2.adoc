= Deleting the images from disconnected environment

To delete images from a disconnected environment using the oc-mirror plugin v2, follow the procedure.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file that deletes previous images:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc mirror delete --config delete-image-set-config.yaml --workspace file://<previously_mirrored_work_folder> --v2 --generate docker://<remote_registry>
----
Where:
- `<previously_mirrored_work_folder>`: Use the directory where images were previously mirrored or stored during the mirroring process.
- `<remote_registry>`: Insert the URL or address of the remote container registry from which images will be deleted.

. Go to the `<previously_mirrored_work_folder>/delete directory` that was created.

. Verify that the `delete-images.yaml` file has been generated.

. Manually ensure that each image listed in the file is no longer needed by the cluster and can be safely removed from the registry.

. After you generate the `delete` YAML file, delete the images from the remote registry:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc mirror delete --v2 --delete-yaml-file <previously_mirrored_work_folder>/delete/delete-images.yaml docker:/ <remote_registry>
----
Where:
- `<previously_mirrored_work_folder>`: Specify your previously mirrored work folder.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
When using the mirror-to-mirror procedure, images are not cached locally, so you cannot delete images from a local cache.
