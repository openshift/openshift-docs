[id="migration-about-migrating-applications-api_{context}"]
= About migrating applications

You can migrate applications from a local cluster to a remote cluster, from a remote cluster to a local cluster, and between remote clusters.

[id="terminology_{context}"]
== Terminology

Source cluster::
* Cluster from which the applications are migrated.

Destination cluster::
* Cluster to which the applications are migrated.

Replication repository::
* Object storage.
* Requires network access to all clusters.

Indirect migration::
* Images, volumes, and Kubernetes objects are copied from the source cluster to the replication repository and then from the replication repository to the destination cluster.

Direct volume migration::
* Volumes are copied directly from the source cluster to the destination cluster.
* Significantly faster than indirect migration.

Direct image migration::
* Images are copied directly from the source cluster to the destination cluster.
* Significantly faster than indirect migration.

Host cluster::
* Cluster on which the `migration-controller` pod and the web console run.
* Usually the same as the destination cluster and the local cluster but this is not a requirement.
* Does not require an exposed secure registry route for direct image migration.

Remote cluster::
* Usually the same as the source cluster but this is not a requirement.
* Requires an exposed secure registry route for direct image migration.
* Requires a `Secret` CR containing the `migration-controller` service account token.

[id="mapping-destination-namespaces-in-the-migplan-custom-resource_{context}"]
== Mapping destination namespaces in the MigPlan custom resource (CR)

If you map destination namespaces in the `MigPlan` CR, you must ensure that the namespaces are not duplicated on the source or the destination clusters because the UID and GID ranges of the namespaces are copied during migration.

.Two source namespaces mapped to the same destination namespace
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  namespaces:
    - namespace_2
    - namespace_1:namespace_2
----

If you want the source namespace to be mapped to a namespace of the same name, you do not need to create a mapping. By default, a source namespace and a target namespace have the same name.

.Incorrect namespace mapping

  namespaces:

.Correct namespace reference

[id="using-migmigration-crs-for-stage-migration-cancellation-and-rollback_{context}"]
== Stage migration, migration cancellation, and migration rollback

You can create and associate multiple `MigMigration` custom resources (CRs) with the same `MigPlan` CR for the following use cases:

* To perform a stage migration, which copies all available data without stopping the application pods. Running a stage migration reduces the cutover time.
* To cancel a migration in progress.
* To roll back a completed migration.

[id="creating-registry-route-for-direct-image-migration_{context}"]
== Creating a registry route for direct image migration

For direct image migration, you must create a route to the exposed internal registry on all remote clusters.

.Prerequisites

* The internal registry must be exposed to external traffic on all remote clusters.
+
The {product-title} 4 registry is exposed by default.
ifdef::advanced-migration-options-3-4[]
+
The {product-title} 3 registry must be link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/registry/securing_and_exposing_registry.html#exposing-the-registry[exposed manually].
endif::[]

.Procedure

ifdef::advanced-migration-options-3-4[]
* To create a route to an {product-title} 3 registry, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create route passthrough --service=docker-registry --port=5000 -n default
----
endif::[]

* To create a route to an {product-title} 4 registry, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create route passthrough --service=image-registry --port=5000 -n openshift-image-registry
----
