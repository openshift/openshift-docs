= Installing the {clo} using the {product-title} web console
To install and configure logging on your {product-title} cluster, additional Operators must be installed. This can be done from the Operator Hub within the web console.

{Product-title} Operators use custom resources (CR) to manage applications and their components. High-level configuration and settings are provided by the user within a CR. The Operator translates high-level directives into low-level actions, based on best practices embedded within the Operatorâ€™s logic. A custom resource definition (CRD) defines a CR and lists all the configurations available to users of the Operator. Installing an Operator creates the CRDs, which are then used to generate CRs.

.Prerequisites

* Supported object store (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure, Swift, Minio, OpenShift Data Foundation)

.Procedure

. To install the {clo} in the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

.. Type `OpenShift Logging` in the filter by keyword box. Choose *Red Hat OpenShift Logging* from the list of available Operators and click *Install*.

.. On the *Install Operator* page, under *Update channel* select *stable*.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `stable` channel only provides updates to the most recent release of logging. To continue receiving updates for prior releases, you must change your subscription channel to `stable-X` where `X` is the version of logging you have installed.
====
+
As the {clo} is only deployable to the `openshift-logging` namespace, *Installation mode* and *Installed Namespace* is already selected. If this namespace does not already exist, it is created for you.

.. If you are creating the `openshift-logging` namespace, select the option to *Enable Operator recommended cluster monitoring on this Namespace*.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the `openshift-logging` namespace already exists, you must add the namespace label, `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"`, to enable metrics service discovery.
====

.. Under *Update approval* select *Automatic*.
+
If the approval strategy in the subscription is set to *Automatic*, the update process initiates as soon as a new Operator version is available in the selected channel. If the approval strategy is set to *Manual*, you must manually approve pending updates.

.. For *Console plugin* select *Enable*, then click *Install*.

The Operators should now be available to all users and projects that use this cluster.

.Verification

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.
. Make sure the *openshift-logging* project is selected.
. In the *Status* column, verify that you see green checkmarks with *InstallSucceeded* and the text *Up to date*.

[NOTE]
====
An Operator might display a `Failed` status before the installation finishes. If the Operator install completes with an `InstallSucceeded` message, refresh the page.
