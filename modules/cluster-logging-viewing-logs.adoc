= Viewing cluster logs

You can view cluster logs in the CLI. 

.Prerequisites

* Cluster logging and Elasticsearch must be installed.

.Procedure 

To view cluster logs:

Use the `oc logs [-f] <pod_name>` command, where the `-f`
is optional.

----
$ oc logs -f <any-fluentd-pod> -n openshift-logging <1>
----
<1> Specify the name of a log collector pod. Use the `-f` option to follow what is being written into the logs.

For example

----
$ oc logs -f fluentd-ht42r -n openshift-logging
----

The contents of log files are printed out.

By default, Fluentd reads logs from the tail, or end, of the log.
