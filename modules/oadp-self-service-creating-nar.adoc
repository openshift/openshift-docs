= Creating a NonAdminRestore CR

[role="_abstract"]
Create a `NonAdminRestore` (NAR) custom resource (CR) to restore application resources from a backup to your authorized namespace. This provides an ability to recover your application data and configuration without requiring cluster administrator privileges.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the cluster as a namespace admin user.
* The cluster administrator has installed the {oadp-short} Operator.
* The cluster administrator has configured the `DataProtectionApplication` (DPA) CR to enable {oadp-short} Self-Service.
* The cluster administrator has created a namespace for you and has authorized you to operate from that namespace.
* You have a backup of your application by creating a `NonAdminBackup` (NAB) CR.

.Procedure

. To create a `NonAdminRestore` CR, create a YAML manifest file with the following configuration:
+
.Example `NonAdminRestore` CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: NonAdminRestore
metadata:
  name: test-nar
spec:
  restoreSpec:
    backupName: test-nab
----
+
where:

`name`:: Specifies a name for the NAR CR. For example, `test-nar`.
`backupName`:: Specifies the name of the NAB CR you want to restore from. For example, `test-nab`.

. To apply the NAR CR configuration, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <nar_cr_filename>
----
Replace `<nar_cr_filename>` with the file name containing the NAR CR configuration.

.Verification

. To verify that the NAR CR is successfully created, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nar test-nar -o yaml
----
+

where:

`message: restore accepted`:: Specifies that the `NonAdminController` (NAC) CR has reconciled and validated the NAR CR.
`fileSystemPodVolumeRestores`:: Specifies the number of volumes that are restored.
`phase: Created`:: Specifies that the NAR CR is in the `Created` phase.
`estimatedQueuePosition`:: Specifies the queue position of the restore object. There can be multiple restores in process, and each restore is assigned a queue position. When the restore is complete, the queue position is set to `0`.
`nacuuid`:: Specifies that the NAC creates the `Velero` restore object and sets the `nacuuid` value.
`name`:: Specifies the name of the associated `Velero` restore object.
`phase: Completed`:: Specifies that the `Velero` restore object is in the `Completed` phase and the restore is successful.
