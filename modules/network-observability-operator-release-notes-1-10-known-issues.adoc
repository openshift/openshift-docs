= Network Observability Operator 1.10 known issues

[role="_abstract"]
Review the following known issues and their recommended workarounds (where available) that might affect your use of the Network Observability Operator 1.10 release.

[id="upgrading-to-1-10-fails-on-ocp-4-14-and-earlier_{context}"]
== Upgrading to 1.10 fails on {product-title} 4.14 and earlier

Upgrading to the Network Observability Operator 1.10 on {product-title} 4.14 and earlier can fail due to a `FlowCollector` custom resource definition (CRD) validation error in the software catalog.

To workaround this problem, you must:

. Uninstall both versions of the Network Observability Operator from the software catalog in the {product-title} web console.
.. Keep the `FlowCollector` CRD installed so that it doesn't cause any disruption in the flow collection process.

. Check the current name of the `FlowCollector` CRD by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get crd flowcollectors.flows.netobserv.io -o jsonpath='{.spec.versions[0].name}'
----
+
Expected output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
v1beta1
----

. Check the current serving status of the `FlowCollector` CRD by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get crd flowcollectors.flows.netobserv.io -o jsonpath='{.spec.versions[0].served}'
----
+
Expected output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
true
----

. Set the `served` flag for the `v1beta1` version to `false` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch crd flowcollectors.flows.netobserv.io --type='json' -p "[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/spec/versions/0/served', 'value': false}]"
----

. Verify that the `served` flag is set to `false` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get crd flowcollectors.flows.netobserv.io -o jsonpath='{.spec.versions[0].served}'
----
+
Expected output:
+
[source,terminal]
----
false
----

. Install Network Observability Operator 1.10.

[id="eBPF-agent-compatibility-with-older-open-shift-versions_{context}"]
== eBPF agent compatibility with older {product-title} versions
The eBPF agent used in the Network Observability Command Line Interface (CLI) packet capture feature is incompatible with {product-title} versions 4.16 and older.

This limitation prevents the eBPF-based Packet Capture Agent (PCA) from functioning correctly on those older clusters.

To work around this problem, you must manually configure PCA to use an older, compatible eBPF agent container image. For more information, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase Solution link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7132671[eBPF agent compatibility with older Openshift versions in Network Observability CLI 1.10+].

[id="ebpf-agent-fail-to-send-flows-with-openshift-sdn-when-network-policy-enabled_{context}"]
== eBPF Agent fails to send flows with OpenShiftSDN when NetworkPolicy is enabled

When running Network Observability Operator 1.10 on {product-title} 4.14 clusters that use the `OpenShiftSDN` CNI plugin, the eBPF agent is unable to send flow records to the `flowlogs-pipeline` component. This occurs when the `FlowCollector` custom resource is created with `NetworkPolicy` enabled (`spec.networkPolicy.enable: true`).

As a consequence, flow data is not processed by the `flowlogs-pipeline` component and does not appear in the *Network Traffic* dashboard or the configured storage (Loki). The eBPF agent pod logs show `i/o timeout` errors when attempting to connect to the collector:

[source,terminal]
----
time="2025-10-17T13:53:44Z" level=error msg="couldn't send flow records to collector" collector="10.0.68.187:2055" component=exporter/GRPCProto error="rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = connection error: desc = \"transport: Error while dialing: dial tcp 10.0.68.187:2055: i/o timeout\""
----

To work around this problem, set `spec.networkPolicy.enable` to `false` to disable `NetworkPolicy` in the `FlowCollector` resource for Network Observability Operator 1.10.

This will allow the eBPF agent to communicate with the `flowlogs-pipeline` component without interference from the automatically deployed network policy.
