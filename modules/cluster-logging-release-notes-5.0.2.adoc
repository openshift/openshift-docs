== Bug fixes

* If you did not set `.proxy` in the cluster installation configuration,
and then configured a global proxy on the installed cluster, a bug
prevented Fluentd from forwarding logs to Elasticsearch. To work around
this issue, in the proxy/cluster configuration, set `no_proxy` to
`.svc.cluster.local` so it skips internal traffic. The current release
fixes the proxy configuration issue. Now, if you configure the global proxy
after installing an OpenShift cluster, Fluentd forwards logs to
Elasticsearch. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1187[*LOG-1187*])

* Previously, forwarding logs to Kafka using chained certificates failed
with error "state=error: certificate verify failed (unable to get local
issuer certificate)." Logs could not be forwarded to a Kafka broker with a
certificate signed by an intermediate CA. This happened because fluentd
Kafka plugin could only handle a single CA certificate supplied in the
ca-bundle.crt entry of the corresponding secret. The current release fixes
this issue by enabling the fluentd Kafka plugin to handle multiple CA
certificates supplied in the ca-bundle.crt entry of the corresponding
secret. Now, logs can be forwarded to a Kafka broker with a certificate
signed by an intermediate CA. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1216[*LOG-1216*], link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1218[*LOG-1218*])

* Previously, an update in the cluster service version (CSV) accidentally introduced resources and limits for the OpenShift Elasticsearch operator container. Under specific conditions, this caused an out-of-memory condition that terminated the Elasticsearch operator pod. The current release fixes this issue by removing the CSV resources and limits for the operator container. Now, the operator gets scheduled without issues.
