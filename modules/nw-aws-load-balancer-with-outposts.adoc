= Using the AWS Load Balancer Operator in an AWS VPC cluster extended into an Outpost

You can configure the AWS Load Balancer Operator to provision an AWS Application Load Balancer in an AWS VPC cluster extended into an Outpost.
AWS Outposts does not support AWS Network Load Balancers.
As a result, the AWS Load Balancer Operator cannot provision Network Load Balancers in an Outpost.

You can create an AWS Application Load Balancer either in the cloud subnet or in the Outpost subnet.
An Application Load Balancer in the cloud can attach to cloud-based compute nodes and an Application Load Balancer in the Outpost can attach to edge compute nodes.
You must annotate Ingress resources with the Outpost subnet or the VPC subnet, but not both.

.Prerequisites

* You have extended an AWS VPC cluster into an Outpost.

* You have installed the {oc-first}.

* You have installed the AWS Load Balancer Operator and created the AWS Load Balancer Controller.

.Procedure

* Configure the `Ingress` resource to use a specified subnet:

* To use the Application Load Balancer in an Outpost, specify the Outpost subnet ID.
* To use the Application Load Balancer in the cloud, you must specify at least two subnets in different availability zones.
