= Creating infrastructure machine sets for production environments

In a production deployment, it is recommended that you deploy at least three compute machine sets to hold infrastructure components. {SMProductName} deploys Elasticsearch, which requires three instances to be installed on different nodes. Each of these nodes can be deployed to different availability zones for high availability. A configuration like this requires three different compute machine sets, one for each availability zone. In global Azure regions that do not have multiple availability zones, you can use availability sets to ensure high availability. Use the sample compute machine set for your cloud.
