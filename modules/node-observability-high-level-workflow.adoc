= High level workflow of the Node Observability Operator

After you install the Node Observability Operator in the {product-title} cluster, you have to create a `NodeObservability` custom resource, which creates a DaemonSet to deploy a Node Observability agent on each worker node.

To request a profiling query, you have to create a `NodeObservabilityRun` resource that requests the deployed Node Observability agent to trigger the CRI-O and Kubelet profiling. After the profiling is completed, the Node Observability agent stores the profiling data inside the container file system `/run/node-observability` directory, which is available for query.
