[id="machineset-upi-reqs-ignition-config_{context}"]
= Satisfying Ignition configuration requirements

Provisioning virtual machines (VMs) requires a valid Ignition configuration. The Ignition configuration contains the `machine-config-server` address and a system trust bundle for obtaining further Ignition configurations from the Machine Config Operator.

By default, this configuration is stored in the `worker-user-data` secret in the `machine-api-operator` namespace. Compute machine sets reference the secret during the machine creation process.

.Procedure

. To determine whether the required secret exists, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get secret \
  -n openshift-machine-api worker-user-data \
  -o go-template='{{range $k,$v := .data}}{{printf "%s: " $k}}{{if not $v}}{{$v}}{{else}}{{$v | base64decode}}{{end}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'
----
+
.Sample output
[source,terminal]
----
disableTemplating: false
userData: <1>
  {
    "ignition": {
      ...
      },
    ...
  }
----
<1> The full output is omitted here, but should have this format.

. If the secret does not exist, create it by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create secret generic worker-user-data \
  -n openshift-machine-api \
  --from-file=<installation_directory>/worker.ign
----
+
where `<installation_directory>` is the directory that was used to store your installation assets during cluster installation.
