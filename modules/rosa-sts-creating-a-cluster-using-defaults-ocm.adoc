When using the {cluster-manager-first} {hybrid-console-second} to create a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster that uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS), you can select the default options to create the cluster quickly. You can also use the admin {cluster-manager} IAM role to enable automatic deployment of the cluster-specific Operator roles and the OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider.

To successfully install ROSA clusters, use the latest version of the ROSA CLI.
====
* You have verified that the AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service role exists in your AWS account.
* You have associated your AWS account with your Red Hat organization. When you associated your account, you applied the administrative permissions to the {cluster-manager} role. For detailed steps, see _Associating your AWS account with your Red Hat organization_.

.Procedure

. Navigate to {cluster-manager-url} and select *Create cluster*.

. On the *Create an OpenShift cluster* page, select *Create cluster* in the *{product-title} (ROSA)* row.

. Verify that your AWS account ID is listed in the *Associated AWS accounts* drop-down menu and that the installer, support, worker, and control plane account role Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) are listed on the *Accounts and roles* page. 
+
[NOTE]
====
If your AWS account ID is not listed, check that you have successfully associated your AWS account with your Red Hat organization. If your account role ARNs are not listed, check that the required account-wide STS roles exist in your AWS account.
====

. Click *Next*.

. On the *Cluster details* page, provide a *Cluster name*. Leave the default values in the remaining fields and click *Next*.

. To deploy a cluster quickly, leave the default options in the *Cluster settings*, *Networking*, *Cluster roles and policies*, and *Cluster updates* pages and click *Next* on each page.

. On the *Review your ROSA cluster* page, review the summary of your selections and click *Create cluster* to start the installation.

.Verification

* You can monitor the progress of the installation in the *Overview* page for your cluster. You can view the installation logs on the same page. Your cluster is ready when the *Status* in the *Details* section of the page is listed as *Ready*.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the installation fails or the cluster *State* does not change to *Ready* after about 40 minutes, check the installation troubleshooting documentation for details. For more information, see _Troubleshooting installations_. For steps to contact Red Hat Support for assistance, see _Getting support for Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS_.
