= Customizing the {rh-virtualization} virtual machine template

Optionally, you can customize the {rh-virtualization-first} virtual machine template the installer uses to create the {product-title} master and worker nodes. For example, you can modify the virtual machine template so the cluster nodes have larger 120 GiB disks instead of the smaller default disk size.

NOTE: This is a workaround for customizing the {rh-virtualization-first} nodes. Better methods will be made available.

IMPORTANT: To install and run {product-title} on {rh-virtualization-first} without failures, calculate the additional resources required for any customizations you make. Then, ensure that the {rh-virtualization} environment has these additional resources.

.Procedure
. From the installer machine, open the RHV Administration Portal and go to *Compute* -> *Virtual machines*.
. Check that the cluster has sufficient resources for the customizations you intend to make.
. Create a new working directory that contains a *copy* of `install-config.yaml`.
+
NOTE: Running the installer deletes this copy of `install-config.yaml`.
+
. Run the installer from the command line. For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo ./openshift-install create cluster --dir <a-working-directory>
----
+
. Watch the Administration Portal for new virtual machines being created by the installer.
. When you see the new virtual machines, enter *ctrl+c* on the command line to interrupt the installer.
. Connect to the created virtual machines and locate the template that was just created.
For example, with a cluster named *test*, the virtual machines and template would be named something like *test-vjhkb-master-0* and a template named something like *test-vjhkb-rhcos*.
. Rename the template to something like *rhcos-ocp-4.4*.
. Create a virtual machine from the template.
. Change the virtual machine characteristics. For example, extend the disk size to 120 GiB.
. Make a new template from the updated virtual machine and name it something like *rhcos-ocp-4.4-120gb*.
. On the command line, set the image override shell variable to use this new template. For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ export OPENSHIFT_INSTALL_OS_IMAGE_OVERRIDE=<new-vm-template-name> <1>
----
<1> For <new-vm-template-name>, specify the name of your customized virtual machine template.
+
NOTE: Later, after you run the installer again, verify that the virtual machines in the new cluster contain the expected customizations.
