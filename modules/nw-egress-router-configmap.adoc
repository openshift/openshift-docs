= Configuring an egress router destination mappings with a config map

For a large or frequently-changing set of destination mappings, you can use a config map to externally maintain the list.
An advantage of this approach is that permission to edit the config map can be delegated to users without `cluster-admin` privileges. Because the egress router pod requires a privileged container, it is not possible for users without `cluster-admin` privileges to edit the pod definition directly.

[NOTE]
====
The egress router pod does not automatically update when the config map changes.
You must restart the egress router pod to get updates.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Create a file containing the mapping data for the egress router pod, as in the following example:
+
----
# Egress routes for Project "Test", version 3

80   tcp 203.0.113.25

8080 tcp 203.0.113.26 80
8443 tcp 203.0.113.26 443

# Fallback
203.0.113.27
----
+
You can put blank lines and comments into this file.

. Create a `ConfigMap` object from the file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete configmap egress-routes --ignore-not-found
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create configmap egress-routes \
  --from-file=destination=my-egress-destination.txt
----
+
In the previous command, the `egress-routes` value is the name of the `ConfigMap` object to create and `my-egress-destination.txt` is the name of the file that the data is read from.

. Create an egress router pod definition and specify the `configMapKeyRef` stanza for the `EGRESS_DESTINATION` field in the environment stanza:
+
[source,yaml]
----
...
env:
- name: EGRESS_DESTINATION
  valueFrom:
    configMapKeyRef:
      name: egress-routes
      key: destination
...
----
