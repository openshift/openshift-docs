= Security considerations for telco CNFs

Telco workloads handle vast amounts of sensitive data and demand high reliability. A single security vulnerability can lead to broader cluster-wide compromises. With numerous components running on a {sno} cluster, each component must be secured to prevent any breach from escalating. Ensuring security across the entire infrastructure, including all components, is essential to maintaining the integrity of the telco network and avoiding vulnerabilities.

The following key security features are essential for telco:

* Security Context Constraints (SCCs): Provide granular control over pod security in the OpenShift clusters.
* Pod Security Admission (PSA): Kubernetes-native pod security controls.
* Encryption: Ensures data confidentiality in high-throughput network environments.
