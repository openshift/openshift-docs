= Modifying Central custom resource for external database

.Prerequisites
* You must have a database in your database instance that supports PostgreSQL 13 or 15 and a user with the following permissions:
** Connection rights to the database.
** `Usage` and `Create` on the schema.
** `Select`, `Insert`, `Update`, and `Delete` on all tables in the schema.
** `Usage` on all sequences in the schema.
+
[NOTE]
====
Postgres 15 is the recommended and supported version. Red{nbsp}Hat has deprecated the support for Postgres 13 and will remove it in the newer versions of {product-title-short}.
====

.Procedure
. Create a password secret in the deployed namespace by using the {ocp} web console or the terminal.
** On the {ocp} web console, go to the *Workloads* → *Secrets* page. Create a *Key/Value secret* with the key `password` and the value as the path of a plain text file containing the password for the superuser of the provisioned database.
** Or, run the following command in your terminal:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create secret generic external-db-password \ <1>
  --from-file=password=<password.txt> <2>
----
<1> If you use Kubernetes, enter `kubectl` instead of `oc`.
<2> Replace `password.txt` with the path of the file which has the plain text password.
. Go to the {product-title} operator page in the {ocp} web console. Select *Central* in the top navigation bar and select the instance you want to connect to the database.
. Go to the *YAML editor* view.
. For *`db.passwordSecret.name`* specify the referenced secret that you created in earlier steps. For example, `external-db-password`.
. For *`db.connectionString`* specify the connection string in `keyword=value` format, for example, `host=<host> port=5432 database=stackrox user=stackrox sslmode=verify-ca`
. For *`db.persistence`* delete the entire block.
. If necessary, you can specify a Certificate Authority for Central to trust the database certificate by adding a TLS block under the top-level spec, as shown in the following example:

** Update the central custom resource with the following configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
spec:
  tls:
    additionalCAs:
    - name: db-ca
      content: |
        <certificate>
  central:
    db:
      isEnabled: Default <1>
      connectionString: "host=<host> port=5432 user=<user> sslmode=verify-ca"
      passwordSecret:
        name: external-db-password
----
<1> You must not change the value of `IsEnabled` to `Enabled`.

. Click *Save*.
