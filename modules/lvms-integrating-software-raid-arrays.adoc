= Integrating software RAID arrays with LVM Storage

You can create the Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) array by using the `mdadm` utility, and integrate the RAID array with {lvms}. Logical Volume Manager (LVM) does not support creating a software RAID.

You can integrate the RAID array with {lvms} while creating the `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR).

.Prerequisites

* You created a software RAID during the {product-title} installation.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You can only create the RAID array during the installation of {product-title}.
====

* You have installed {lvms}.

.Procedure

. Open the `LVMCluster` CR YAML file.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you have created the `LVMCluster` CR, edit the existing `LVMCluster` CR YAML file.
====

. Add the path to the RAID array in the `deviceSelector` field of the `LVMCluster` CR YAML file.

<1> Contains the paths to the devices that are used to create the LVM volume group. You can specify the device paths in the `paths` field, the `optionalPaths` field, or both. You cannot remove or replace a device after adding it to the LVM volume group.
<2> Example of a path to the RAID array that was created by using the `mdadm` utility. In this example, `md-var` is the RAID array.
<3> In this device path example, `md0` is the RAID array

. Save the `LVMCluster` CR YAML file.

[NOTE]
====
If you do not add the path to the RAID array in the `deviceSelector` field, the {lvms} Operator does not recognize the RAID array.
