= {PM-kepler} hardware and virtualization support

{PM-kepler} is the key component of {PM-shortname} that collects real-time power consumption data from a node through one of the following methods:

Kernel Power Management Subsystem (preferred)::
* `rapl-sysfs`: This requires access to the `/sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl` host file.
* `rapl-msr`: This requires access to the `/dev/cpu/*/msr` host file.

The `estimator` power source::
Without access to the kernel's power cap subsystem, {PM-kepler} uses a machine learning model to estimate the power usage of the CPU on the node.

[WARNING]
====
The `estimator` feature is experimental, not supported, and should not be relied upon.

You can identify the power estimation method for a node by using the *Power Monitoring / Overview* dashboard.
