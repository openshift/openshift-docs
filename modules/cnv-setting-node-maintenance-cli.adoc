= Setting a node to maintenance mode in the CLI

Set a node to maintenance mode by creating a `NodeMaintenance` Custom Resource 
(CR) object that references the node name and the reason for setting it to 
maintenance mode.  

.Procedure

. Create the node maintenance CR configuration. This example uses a CR that is 
called `node02-maintenance.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha1
kind: NodeMaintenance
metadata:
  name: node02-maintenance
spec:
  nodeName: node02
  reason: "Replacing node02"
----

. Create the `NodeMaintenance` object in the cluster:
+
----
$ oc apply -f <node02-maintenance.yaml>
----

The node live migrates virtual machine instances that have the 
`liveMigration` eviction strategy, and taint the node so that it is no longer 
schedulable. All other pods and virtual machines on the node are deleted and 
recreated on another node.
