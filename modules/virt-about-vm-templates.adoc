= About virtual machine templates

Preconfigured Red Hat virtual machine templates are listed in the *Virtualization* -> *Templates* page. These templates are available for different versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, Microsoft Windows 10, and Microsoft Windows Servers. Each Red Hat virtual machine template is preconfigured with the operating system image, default settings for the operating system, flavor (CPU and memory), and workload type (server).

The *Templates* page displays four types of virtual machine templates:

* *Red Hat Supported* templates are fully supported by Red Hat.
* *User Supported* templates are *Red Hat Supported* templates that were cloned and created by users.
* *Red Hat Provided* templates have limited support from Red Hat.
* *User Provided* templates are *Red Hat Provided* templates that were cloned and created by users.

You can use the filters in the template *Catalog* to sort the templates by attributes such as boot source availability, operating system, and workload.

You cannot edit or delete a *Red Hat Supported* or *Red Hat Provided* template. You can clone the template, save it as a custom virtual machine template, and then edit it.

You can also create a custom virtual machine template by editing a YAML file example.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Due to differences in storage behavior, some virtual machine templates are incompatible with {sno}. To ensure compatibility, do not set the `evictionStrategy` field for any templates or virtual machines that use data volumes or storage profiles.
