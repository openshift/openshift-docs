= About virtual machine templates

Preconfigured Red Hat virtual machine templates are listed in the *Templates* tab within the *Virtualization* page. These  templates are available for different versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, Microsoft Windows 10, and Microsoft Windows Servers. Each Red Hat virtual machine template is preconfigured with the operating system image, default settings for the operating system, flavor (CPU and memory), and workload type (server).

The *Templates* tab displays four types of virtual machine templates:

* *Red Hat Supported* templates are fully supported by Red Hat.
* *User Supported* templates are *Red Hat Supported* templates that were cloned and created by users.
* *Red Hat Provided* templates have limited support from Red Hat.
* *User Provided* templates are *Red Hat Provided* templates that were cloned and created by users.

[NOTE]
====
In the Templates tab, you cannot edit or delete Red Hat Supported or Red Hat Provided templates. You can only edit or delete custom virtual machine templates that were created by users.
====

Using a Red Hat template is convenient because the template is already preconfigured. When you select a Red Hat template to create your own custom template, the *Create Virtual Machine Template* wizard prompts you to add a boot source if a boot source was not added previously. Then, you can either save your custom template or continue to customize it and save it.

You can also select the *Create Virtual Machine Template* wizard directly and create a custom virtual machine template. The wizard prompts you to provide configuration details for the operating system, flavor, workload type, and other settings. You can add a boot source and continue to customize your template and save it.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Due to differences in storage behavior, some virtual machine templates are incompatible with SNO. To ensure compatibility, do not set the `evictionStrategy` field for any templates or virtual machines that use data volumes or storage profiles.
