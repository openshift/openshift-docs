= Optional: Configuring the RAID

The following procedure configures a redundant array of independent disks (RAID) using baseboard management controllers (BMCs) during the installation process.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to configure a hardware RAID for the node, verify that the node has a supported RAID controller. {product-title} {product-version} does not support software RAID.

.Hardware RAID support by vendor
[options="header"]
|====
|Vendor | BMC and protocol |Firmware version|RAID levels
|Fujitsu | iRMC |N/A|0, 1, 5, 6, and 10
|Dell | iDRAC with Redfish  | Version 6.10.30.20 or later | 0, 1, and 5
|====

.Procedure

. Create the manifests.

. Modify the `BareMetalHost` resource corresponding to the node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ vim clusterconfigs/openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_hosts-*.yaml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The following example uses a hardware RAID configuration because {product-title} {product-version} does not support software RAID.
====
+
.. If you added a specific RAID configuration to the `spec` section, this causes the node to delete the original RAID configuration in the `preparing` phase and perform a specified configuration on the RAID. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  raid:
    hardwareRAIDVolumes:
    - level: "0" <1>
      name: "sda"
      numberOfPhysicalDisks: 1
      rotational: true
      sizeGibibytes: 0
----
<1> `level` is a required field, and the others are optional fields.
+
.. If you added an empty RAID configuration to the `spec` section, the empty configuration causes the node to delete the original RAID configuration during the `preparing` phase, but does not perform a new configuration. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  raid:
    hardwareRAIDVolumes: []
----
+
.. If you do not add a `raid` field in the `spec` section, the original RAID configuration is not deleted, and no new configuration will be performed.

. Create the cluster.
