.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, navigate to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

. Use the *Filter by keyword* box to search for `{servicebinding-title}` in the catalog. Click the *{servicebinding-title}* tile.

. Read the brief description about the Operator on the *{servicebinding-title}* page. Click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page:
+
.. Select *All namespaces on the cluster (default)* for the *Installation Mode*. This mode installs the Operator in the default `openshift-operators` namespace, which enables the Operator to watch and be made available to all namespaces in the cluster.

.. Select *Automatic* for the *Approval Strategy*. This ensures that the future upgrades to the Operator are handled automatically by the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). If you select the *Manual* approval strategy, OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve the OLM update request to update the Operator to the new version.

.. Select an *Update Channel*.

*** By default, the *stable* channel enables installation of the latest stable and supported release of the {servicebinding-title}.

. Click *Install*.
