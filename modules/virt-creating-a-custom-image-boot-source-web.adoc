You can prepare a custom disk image, based on an existing disk image, for use as a boot source.

Use this procedure to complete the following tasks:

* Preparing a custom disk image
* Creating a boot source from the custom disk image
* Attaching the boot source to a custom template

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} console, click *Virtualization* -> *Templates* from the side menu.
. Click the link in the *Boot source* column for the template you want to customize. A window displays, indicating that the template currently has a *defined* source.
. In the window, click the *Customize source* link.
. Click *Continue* in the *About boot source customization* window to proceed with customization after reading the information provided about the boot source customization process.
. On the *Prepare boot source customization* page, in the *Define new template* section:
.. Select the *New template namespace* field and then choose a project.
.. Enter the name of the custom template in the *New template name* field.
.. Enter the name of the template provider in the *New template provider* field.
.. Select the *New template support* field and then choose the appropriate value, indicating support contacts for the custom template you create.
.. Select the *New template flavor* field and then choose the appropriate CPU and memory values for the custom image you create.
. In the *Prepare boot source for customization* section, customize the `cloud-init` YAML script, if needed, to define login credentials. Otherwise, the script generates default credentials for you.
. Click *Start Customization*. The customization process begins and the *Preparing boot source customization* page displays, followed by the *Customize boot source* page. The *Customize boot source* page displays the output of the running script. When the script completes, your custom image is available.

. When the image is ready for login, sign in with the *VNC Console* by providing the user name and password displayed in the *Guest login credentials* section.
. Verify the custom image works as expected. If it does, click *Make this boot source available*.
. In the *Finish customization and make template available* window, select
*I have sealed the boot source so it can be used as a template* and then click *Apply*.
. On the *Finishing boot source customization* page, wait for the template creation process to complete. Click *Navigate to template details* or *Navigate to template list* to view your customized template, created from your custom boot source.
