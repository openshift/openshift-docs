= Reviewing alerts to identify uses of removed APIs

Two alerts fire when an API is in use that will be removed in the next release:

* `APIRemovedInNextReleaseInUse` - for APIs that will be removed in the next {product-title} release.
* `APIRemovedInNextEUSReleaseInUse` - for APIs that will be removed in the next {product-title} Extended Update Support (EUS) release.

If either of these alerts are firing in your cluster, review the alerts and take action to clear the alerts by migrating manifests and API clients to use the new API version. You can use the `APIRequestCount` API to get more information about which APIs are in use and which workloads are using removed APIs.
