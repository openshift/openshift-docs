= Configuring a cluster with single-stack IPv6 networking

You can create a single-stack IPv6 cluster on {rh-openstack-first} after you configure your {rh-openstack} deployment.

IMPORTANT: You cannot convert a dual-stack cluster into a single-stack IPv6 cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Your {rh-openstack} deployment has an existing network with a DHCPv6-stateful IPv6 subnet to use as the machine network.
* DNS is configured for the existing IPv6 subnet.
* The IPv6 subnet is added to a {rh-openstack} router, and the router is configured to send router advertisements (RAs).
* You added any additional IPv6 subnets that are used in the cluster to an {rh-openstack} router to enable router advertisements.
+
NOTE: Using an IPv6 SLAAC subnet is not supported because any `dns_nameservers` addresses are not enforced by {rh-openstack} Neutron.
* You have a mirror registry with an IPv6 interface.
* The {rh-openstack} network accepts a minimum MTU size of 1442 bytes.
* You created API and ingress virtual IP addresses (VIPs) as {rh-openstack} ports on the machine network and included those addresses in the `install-config.yaml` file.

.Procedure

. Create the API VIP port on the network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ openstack port create api --network <v6_machine_network>
----

. Create the Ingress VIP port on the network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ openstack port create ingress --network <v6_machine_network>
----

. After the networking resources are pre-created, deploy a cluster by using an `install-config.yaml` file that reflects your IPv6 network configuration. As an example:
+
[source,yaml]

<1> The CIDR of the subnet specified in this field must match the CIDR of the subnet that is specified in the `controlPlanePort` section.
<2> Use the address from the ports you generated in the previous steps as the values for the parameters `platform.openstack.ingressVIPs` and `platform.openstack.apiVIPs`.
<3> Items under the `platform.openstack.controlPlanePort.fixedIPs` and `platform.openstack.controlPlanePort.network` keys can contain an ID, a name, or both.
<4> The `imageContentSources` section contains the mirror details. For more information on configuring a local image registry, see "Creating a mirror registry with mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift".
