= Verifying the status of the hosted control plane feature

The hosted control plane feature is enabled by default.

.Procedure

. If the feature is disabled and you want to enable it, enter the following command. Replace `<multiclusterengine>` with the name of your {mce-short} instance:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch mce <multiclusterengine> --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"overrides":{"components":[{"name":"hypershift","enabled": true}]}}}'
----
+
When you enable the feature, the `hypershift-addon` managed cluster add-on is installed in the `local-cluster` managed cluster, and the add-on agent installs the HyperShift Operator on the {mce-short} hub cluster.

. Confirm that the `hypershift-addon` managed cluster add-on is installed by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get managedclusteraddons -n local-cluster hypershift-addon
----
+
.Example output
----
NAME               AVAILABLE   DEGRADED   PROGRESSING
hypershift-addon   True        False
----

. To avoid a timeout during this process, enter the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc wait --for=condition=Degraded=True managedclusteraddons/hypershift-addon -n local-cluster --timeout=5m
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc wait --for=condition=Available=True managedclusteraddons/hypershift-addon -n local-cluster --timeout=5m
----
+
When the process is complete, the `hypershift-addon` managed cluster add-on and the HyperShift Operator are installed, and the `local-cluster` managed cluster is available to host and manage hosted clusters.
