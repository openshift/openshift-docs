= Authentication credentials for secured clusters

[role="_abstract"]
To secure communication between Central and the services running on a secured cluster, you must provide authentication credentials during the installation of the secured cluster. {rh-rhacs-first} supports different methods for generating these credentials depending on your installation method and requirements.

You can generate the following authentication credentials by using the `roxctl` CLI:

Init bundles:: An init bundle contains the secrets required to authenticate a secured cluster with Central. You commonly use init bundles for installations managed by Helm charts or the Operator. The bundle includes certificates and keys that establish the trust relationship.

Cluster registration secret (CRS):: A CRS is a specific type of secret that allows a new secured cluster to connect to Central. It contains data that authenticates the cluster and establishes a secure connection. A CRS includes metadata such as an expiration date and the ID of the creator.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Both init bundles and CRS contain sensitive information. You must store them securely. If these credentials are compromised, an attacker could potentially add unauthorized clusters to your {product-title-short} environment.
