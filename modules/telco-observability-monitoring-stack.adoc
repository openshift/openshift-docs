= Understanding the monitoring stack

The monitoring stack uses the following components:

* Prometheus collects and analyzes metrics from {product-title} components and from workloads, if configured to do so.
* Alertmanager is a component of Prometheus that handles routing, grouping, and silencing of alerts.
* Thanos handles long term storage of metrics.

[NOTE]
====
For a {sno} cluster, you should disable Alertmanager and Thanos because the cluster sends all metrics to the hub cluster for analysis and retention.
