= About KubeMacPool

If you enable the KubeMacPool component for a namespace, virtual machine NICs in that namespace are allocated MAC addresses from a MAC address pool.
This ensures that the NIC is assigned a unique MAC address that does not conflict with the MAC address of another virtual machine.

Virtual machine instances created from that virtual machine retain the assigned MAC address across reboots.

[NOTE]
====
KubeMacPool does not handle virtual machine instances created independently from a virtual machine.
====

KubeMacPool is disabled by default.
Enable a MAC address pool for a namespace by applying the KubeMacPool label to the namespace.
