= About KubeMacPool

KubeMacPool provides a MAC address pool per namespace and allocates MAC addresses for virtual machine NICs from the pool.
This ensures that the NIC is assigned a unique MAC address that does not conflict with the MAC address of another virtual machine.

Virtual machine instances created from that virtual machine retain the assigned MAC address across reboots.

[NOTE]
====
KubeMacPool does not handle virtual machine instances created independently from a virtual machine.
====

KubeMacPool is enabled by default when you install {VirtProductName}.
You can disable a MAC address pool for a namespace by adding the `mutatevirtualmachines.kubemacpool.io=ignore` label to the namespace. Re-enable KubeMacPool for the namespace by removing the label.
