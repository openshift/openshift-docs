= IP address assignment for additional networks

[role="_abstract"]
For additional networks, you can assign IP addresses by using an IP Address Management (IPAM) CNI plugin, which supports various assignment methods, including Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and static assignment.

The DHCP IPAM CNI plugin responsible for dynamic assignment of IP addresses operates with two distinct components:

* *CNI Plugin*: Responsible for integrating with the Kubernetes networking stack to request and release IP addresses.
* *DHCP IPAM CNI Daemon*: A listener for DHCP events that coordinates with existing DHCP servers in the environment to handle IP address assignment requests. This daemon is _not_ a DHCP server itself.

For networks requiring `type: dhcp` in their IPAM configuration, ensure the following:

* A DHCP server is available and running in the environment. The DHCP server is external to the cluster and is expected to be part of the customer's existing network infrastructure.
* The DHCP server is appropriately configured to serve IP addresses to the nodes.

In cases where a DHCP server is unavailable in the environment, it is recommended to use the Whereabouts IPAM CNI plugin instead. The Whereabouts CNI provides similar IP address management capabilities without the need for an external DHCP server.

[NOTE]
====
Use the Whereabouts CNI plugin when there is no external DHCP server or where static IP address management is preferred. The Whereabouts plugin includes a reconciler daemon to manage stale IP address allocations.
====

A DHCP lease must be periodically renewed throughout the container's lifetime, so a separate daemon, the DHCP IPAM CNI Daemon, is required. To deploy the DHCP IPAM CNI daemon, modify the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration to trigger the deployment of this daemon as part of the additional network setup.
