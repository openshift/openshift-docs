= Scaling up systemd-journald 

As you scale up your project, the default logging environment might need some
adjustments.

For example, if you are missing logs, you might have to increase the rate limits for journald.

.Procedure

. Update to *systemd-219-22.el7.x86_64*.

. Add the following to the *_/etc/systemd/journald.conf_* file:
+
----
# Disable rate limiting
RateLimitInterval=1s
RateLimitBurst=10000
Storage=volatile
Compress=no
MaxRetentionSec=30s
----

. Restart the services:
+
----
$ systemctl restart systemd-journald.service
$ systemctl restart rsyslog.service
----
+
These settings account for the bursty nature of uploading in bulk.

After removing the rate limit, you might see increased CPU utilization on the
system logging daemons as it processes any messages that would have previously
been throttled.
