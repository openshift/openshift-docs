== New features and enhancements

Incident detection feature reaches General Availability::
The incident detection feature in the {coo-full} reaches General Availability (GA) status in this release for {ocp-product-title} versions 4.19+. Incident detection simplifies observability by grouping related alerts into incidents. This helps reduce alert fatigue and allows you to focus on the root cause of a problem. With General Availability (GA) status, the incident detection feature is production-ready and fully supported for enterprise deployments. Users can enable incident detection through the monitoring `UIPlugin` resource by setting `spec.monitoring.incidents.enabled: true`.
+
For more information, see xref:../ui_plugins/monitoring-ui-plugin.adoc#coo-incident-detection-overview_monitoring-ui-plugin[Incident detection]
+
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-1281[COO-1281]


Incidents view supports silenced alerts::
The incidents view in the monitoring UI plugin supports silenced alerts in this release. Silenced alerts display with a `state` of `Silenced` in the incident detection UI and appear in a lighter color in the timeline. This helps you to distinguish them from active alerts and to understand the complete state of your cluster observability signals.

Troubleshooting reaches General Availability::
The troubleshooting feature in the {coo-full} reaches General Availability (GA) status in this release for {ocp-product-title} versions 4.19+ and is not supported in earlier versions. The troubleshooting UI plugin provides observability signal correlation, powered by the open source Korrel8r project. With the troubleshooting panel you can easily correlate metrics, logs, alerts, netflows, and additional observability signals and resources, across different data stores.
+
For more information, see xref:../ui_plugins/troubleshooting-ui-plugin.adoc#troubleshooting-ui-plugin[Troubleshooting UI plugin]

End-to-end observability with ObservabilityInstaller custom resource::
The {coo-full} provides a `ObservabilityInstaller` custom resource for deploying end-to-end observability with minimal configuration as a Technology Preview feature. The `ObservabilityInstaller` custom resource simplifies the deployment of logging, tracing, and OpenTelemetry capabilities by automatically managing operator installation, storage configuration, and UI integration.

== Bug fixes

Troubleshooting panel handles {ocp-product-title} 4.19 alert URLs correctly::
Before this update, {ocp-product-title} 4.19 introduced changes to alert URL formatting where some URLs contained only console-internal numeric IDs without alert names. As a consequence, the korrel8r troubleshooting panel failed to process these URLs correctly and could not correlate alerts with related resources.
+
With this update, korrel8r correctly handles alert URLs from {ocp-product-title} 4.19, including URLs that contain only numeric identifiers. As a result, the troubleshooting panel works correctly with all alert types on {ocp-product-title} 4.19 clusters.

`UIPlugin` monitoring configuration persists after operator upgrades::
Before this update, when upgrading the {coo-full} from version 1.2.0 to 1.2.1 or later, the monitoring `UIPlugin` configuration was removed during the upgrade process. The `UIPlugin` spec became empty, showing only the plugin type while losing all configuration details such as {rh-rhacm} integration settings, Perses dashboards, and incident management settings. As a consequence, users could not access monitoring dashboards and features after the upgrade, and the operator logged errors stating `monitoring configuration can not be empty for plugin type Monitoring`.
+
With this update, the {coo-full} correctly preserves monitoring `UIPlugin` configuration during upgrades. As a result, monitoring dashboards, {rh-rhacm} integration, and incident management features remain available after operator upgrades without requiring manual reconfiguration.
+

`UIPlugin` status updates correctly in all reconciliation scenarios::
Before this update, the `UIPlugin` controller did not update the custom resource status field in all reconciliation scenarios. The controller failed to update the status when reconciliation errors occurred, causing the status to report success even when configuration changes were not applied. As a consequence, users could not accurately determine the state of `UIPlugin` resources through the status field and had to check the generation field or operator logs to debug issues.
+
With this update, the {coo-full} correctly updates `UIPlugin` status in all reconciliation scenarios, including error conditions. As a result, users can rely on the `UIPlugin` status field to accurately reflect the current state of the resource and troubleshoot configuration issues more effectively.

Distributed tracing `UIPlugin` handles double quotes in TraceQL queries::
Before this update, the distributed tracing `UIPlugin` in COO 1.2.2 did not properly handle double quotes in TraceQL query expressions. The query parser failed when attribute values contained double quotes, such as regular expression patterns in HTTP route attributes. As a consequence, users could not query traces with attributes containing double quotes, even when these values were selected from dropdown menus in the user interface.
+
With this update, the {product-title} distributed tracing console plugin correctly processes TraceQL queries containing double quotes in attribute values. As a result, users can query traces with any attribute values, including those containing special characters like double quotes.
+
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/COO-1175[COO-1175]

Logging view plugin proxies to korrel8r only when troubleshooting panel is deployed::
Before this update, the logging view plugin in COO 1.2.1 configured the {product-title} console to proxy traffic to the korrel8r service even when the troubleshooting panel `UIPlugin` was not deployed. The console attempted to connect to a non-existent service, causing permission denied errors. As a consequence, users experienced transient "Missing permissions to get logs" error messages in the logging view, which resolved on their own after 30-60 seconds without user intervention.
+
With this update, the {coo-full} only configures the korrel8r proxy in the logging view plugin when the troubleshooting panel `UIPlugin` is deployed. As a result, users no longer encounter spurious permission errors when viewing logs without the troubleshooting panel.
+

Distributed tracing search field supports keyboard navigation::
Before this update, the distributed tracing console plugin search field did not support keyboard-only navigation. When users typed a filter value and pressed `Enter` to select it, the page reset to the tenant selection screen instead of applying the filter. As a consequence, keyboard-only users could not filter traces by service name or other attributes and were forced to use mouse-based selection.
+
With this update, the {product-title} distributed tracing console plugin correctly handles the `Enter` key in search fields. As a result, users can apply trace filters using keyboard-only navigation, improving accessibility.
+

`UIPlugin` configuration changes remove disabled feature pods::
Before this update, the `UIPlugin` controller in COO 1.2.1 did not remove pods for disabled features when users updated the configuration. When users set `perses.enabled: false` or `incidents.enabled: false` in the `UIPlugin` specification, the associated pods (perses-0 and health-analyzer) continued to run. As a consequence, users could not disable Perses dashboards or incidents features, and the disabled components continued consuming cluster resources.
+
With this update, the {coo-full} correctly removes pods when features are disabled in the `UIPlugin` configuration. As a result, users can enable or disable Perses and incidents features by updating the `UIPlugin` specification, and the associated pods are created or removed accordingly.
