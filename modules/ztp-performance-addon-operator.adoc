= Performance Addon Operator

The Performance Addon Operator provides the ability to enable advanced node performance tunings on a set of nodes.

{product-title} provides a Performance Addon Operator to implement automatic tuning to achieve low latency
performance for {product-title} applications. The cluster administrator uses this performance profile configuration that makes
it easier to make these changes in a more reliable way.

The administrator can specify updating the kernel to `rt-kernel`, reserving CPUs for management workloads,
and using CPUs for running the workloads.
