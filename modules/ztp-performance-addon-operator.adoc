= Performance Addon Operator

The Performance Addon Operator provides the ability to enable advanced node performance tunings on a set of nodes.

{product-title} (OCP) provides a Performance Addon Operator to implement automatic tuning to achieve low latency
performance for OpenShift applications. The cluster administrator uses this performance profile configuration that makes
it easier to make these changes in a more reliable way.

The administrator can specify updating the kernel to rt-kernel, reserving CPUs for management workloads,
and using CPUs for running the workloads.
