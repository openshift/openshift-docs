= Creating an allow ingress access network policy

With the `deny-by-default` network policy in place, no pods can talk to each other or receive traffic from external sources. One option to enable communication is to allow some pods to receive traffic. To do so, you can create the following `ingress-access` network policy. With this network policy, pods with the  `networking/allow-ingress-access=true` label can receive network traffic.

.Prerequisites

* You have created the `deny-by-default` network policy and applied it to the necessary namespaces.

.Procedure

. Create the following `ingress-access` network policy to allow pods with the `networking/allow-ingress-access` label to receive traffic from outside sources. Save the YAML in the `ingress-access.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: ingress-access
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      networking/allow-ingress-access: "true" <1>
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - {}
----
<1> Apply this label to pods to enable the pod to receive traffic from outside sources.

. Apply the network policy to the `project-a` namespace by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f ingress-access.yaml -n project-a
----

. Apply the network policy to the `project-b` namespace by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f ingress-access.yaml -n project-b
----

. Apply the `networking/allow-ingress-access=true` label to pods that must receive outside traffic by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label pod busybox-pod-a networking/allow-ingress-access=true -n project-a
----
+
Repeat this step for all pods that must receive outside traffic.

.Verification

. Obtain the IP addresses of pods in `project-a` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod -n project-a -o wide
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP            NODE                           NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
busybox-pod-a   1/1     Running   0          13m   10.132.0.38   ip-10-0-132-187.ec2.internal   <none>           <none>
test-pod-a      1/1     Running   0          13m   10.132.0.40   ip-10-0-132-187.ec2.internal   <none>           <none>
----

. Ensure that pods with the `networking/allow-ingress-access=true` label can receive traffic by entering the following command. If you followed these instructions, the `busybox-pod-a` pod in `project-a` can receive traffic from another pod. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -it test-pod-b -n project-b -- ping 10.132.0.44
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----
PING 10.132.0.44 (10.132.0.44): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 10.132.0.44: seq=0 ttl=42 time=1.137 ms
64 bytes from 10.132.0.44: seq=1 ttl=42 time=0.672 ms
----

. Ensure that pods without the `networking/allow-ingress-access=true` label cannot receive traffic by entering the following command. If you followed these instructions, the `test-pod-a` pod in `project-a` cannot receive traffic. For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -it busybox-pod-a -n project-a -- ping 10.132.0.40
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,terminal]
----

--- 10.132.0.40 ping statistics ---
