= About pods

{product-title} leverages the Kubernetes concept of a _pod_, which is one or more containers deployed
together on one host, and the smallest compute unit that can be defined,
deployed, and managed. Pods are the rough equivalent of a machine instance (physical or virtual) to a container.

You can view a list of pods associated with a specific project or view usage statistics about pods.
