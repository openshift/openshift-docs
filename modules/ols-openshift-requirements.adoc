= OpenShift Requirements 

[role="_abstract"]
Hardware and software requirements for {ols-long}, including supported {ocp-product-title} versions and CPU architectures.

Telemetry is enabled on {ocp-product-title} clusters by default. 

* If the cluster has telemetry enabled, the {ols-long} service sends conversations and feedback to Red{nbsp}Hat by default.

* If the cluster has telemetry disabled, the {ols-long} service does not send conversations and feedback to Red{nbsp}Hat.

* If the cluster has telemetry enabled, and you do not want the {ols-long} service to send conversations and feedback to Red{nbsp}Hat, you must disable telemetry.
