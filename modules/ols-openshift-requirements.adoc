{ols-long} requires {ocp-product-title} 4.15 or later running on x86 hardware. Any installation type or deployment architecture is supported so long as the cluster is 4.15+ and x86-based.

Telemetry is enabled on {ocp-product-title} clusters by default. 

* If the cluster has telemetry enabled, the {ols-long} service sends conversations and feedback to Red{nbsp}Hat by default.

* If the cluster has telemetry disabled, the {ols-long} service does not send conversations and feedback to Red{nbsp}Hat.

* If the cluster has telemetry enabled, and you do not want the {ols-long} service to send conversations and feedback to Red{nbsp}Hat, you must disable telemetry.
