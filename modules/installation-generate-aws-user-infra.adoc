= Creating the installation files for AWS

To install {product-title} on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using user-provisioned
infrastructure, you must generate the files that the installation
program needs to deploy your cluster and modify them so that the cluster creates
only the machines that it will use. You generate and customize the
`install_config.yaml` file, Kubernetes manifests, and Ignition config files.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain
certificates that expires after 24 hours. You must complete you cluster
installation before the certificate expires.
====

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the {product-title} installation program and the access token for your cluster.

.Procedure

. Obtain the `install-config.yaml` file.
.. Run the following command:
+
----
$ ./openshift-install create install-config --dir=<installation_directory> <1>
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the directory name to store the
files that the installation program creates.  Do not use a directory which
was used for previous installations unless you want to recycle assets from
those earlier clusters.  Because some assets like bootstrap X.509 certificates
have limited expiration times, it is usually better to use a fresh
installation directory for each new cluster.
.. At the prompts, provide the configuration details for your cloud:
... Optionally, select an SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.
+
[NOTE]
====
For production {product-title} clusters on which you want to perform installation
debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide an SSH key that your `ssh-agent`
process uses to the installer.
====
... Select AWS as the platform to target.
... Select the AWS region to deploy the cluster to.
... Select the base domain for the Route53 service that you configured for your cluster.
... Enter a descriptive name for your cluster.
... Paste the pull secret that you obtained from
link:https://cloud.openshift.com/clusters/install[the OpenShift start page].

. Edit the `install-config.yaml` file to set the number of compute, or worker,
replicas to `0`, as shown in the following `compute` stanza:
+
[source,yaml]
----
compute:
- hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: worker
  platform: {}
  replicas: 0
----

. Optionally, back up the `install-config.yaml` file.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `install-config.yaml` file is consumed during the next step. If you want to
reuse the file, back it up now.
====

. Remove the Kubernetes manifest files for the control plane machines. By
removing these files, you prevent the cluster from automatically generating
control plane machines.
.. Generate the Kubernetes manifests for the cluster:
+
----
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir=<installation_directory> <1>

WARNING There are no compute nodes specified. The cluster will not fully initialize without compute nodes.
INFO Consuming "Install Config" from target directory
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the same installation directory.
+
Because you create your own compute machines later in the installation process,
you can safely ignore this warning.
.. Remove the files that define the control plane machines:
+
----
$ rm -f openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_master-machines-*.yaml
----

ifeval::["{context}" == "installing-aws-user-infra"]
. Remove the Kubernetes manifest files that define the worker machines:
+
----
$ rm -f openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_worker-machineset-*
----
+
Because you create and manage the worker machines yourself, you do not need
to initialize these machines.
endif::[]

. Obtain the Ignition config files:
+
----
$ ./openshift-install create ignition-configs --dir=<installation_directory> <1>
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the same installation directory.
+
The following files are generated in the directory:
+
----
.
├── auth
│   ├── kubeadmin-password
│   └── kubeconfig
├── bootstrap.ign
├── master.ign
├── metadata.json
└── worker.ign
