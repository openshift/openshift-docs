= Creating the installation files for AWS

To install {product-title} on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using user-provisioned
infrastructure, you must generate the files that the installation
program needs to deploy your cluster and modify them so that the cluster creates
only the machines that it will use. You generate and customize the
`install_config.yaml` file, Kubernetes manifests, and Ignition config files.
