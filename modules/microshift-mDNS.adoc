= The multicast DNS protocol

The multicast DNS protocol (mDNS) allows name resolution and service discovery within a Local Area Network (LAN) using multicast exposed on the `5353/UDP` port.

{product-title} includes an embedded mDNS server for deployment scenarios in which the authoritative DNS server cannot be reconfigured to point clients to services on {product-title}. The embedded DNS server allows `.local` domains exposed by {product-title} to be discovered by other elements on the LAN.
