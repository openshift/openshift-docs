= Understanding the {mtc-full}

The {mtc-first} enables you to migrate Kubernetes resources, persistent volume data, and internal container images from an {product-title} source cluster to an {product-title} {product-version} target cluster, using the {mtc-short} web console or the Kubernetes API.

Migrating an application with the {mtc-short} web console involves the following steps:

. Install the {mtc-operator} on all clusters.
+
[NOTE]
====
The {mtc-operator} installs the {mtc-short} web console and the Migration controller on the target cluster by default. You can configure the Migration controller to install the {mtc-short} on another cluster.
====

. Configure the replication repository, an intermediate object storage that the {mtc-short} uses to migrate data.
. Add the source cluster to the {mtc-short} web console.
. Add the replication repository to the {mtc-short} web console.
. Create a migration plan, with one of the following data migration options:

* *Copy*: The {mtc-short} copies the data from the source cluster to the replication repository, and from the replication repository to the target cluster.

* *Move*: The {mtc-short} unmounts a remote volume (for example, NFS) from the source cluster, creates a PV resource on the target cluster pointing to the remote volume, and then mounts the remote volume on the target cluster. Applications running on the target cluster use the same remote volume that the source cluster was using. The remote volume must be accessible to the source and target clusters.
+
[NOTE]
====
Although the replication repository does not appear in this diagram, it is required for the actual migration.

. Run the migration plan, with one of the following options:

* *Stage* (optional) copies data to the target cluster without stopping the application.
+
Staging can be run multiple times so that most of the data is copied to the target before migration. This minimizes the actual migration time and application downtime.

* *Migrate* stops the application on the source cluster and recreates its resources on the target cluster. Optionally, you can migrate the workload without stopping the application.
