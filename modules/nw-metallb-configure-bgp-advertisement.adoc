= Configuring MetalLB with a BGP advertisement and a basic use case

Configure MetalLB as follows so that the peer BGP routers receive one `203.0.113.200/32` route and one `fc00:f853:ccd:e799::1/128` route for each load-balancer IP address that MetalLB assigns to a service.
Because the `localPref` and `communities` fields are not specified, the routes are advertised with `localPref` set to zero and no BGP communities.
