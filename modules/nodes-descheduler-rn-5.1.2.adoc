== Bug fixes

* Previously, when the `LifecycleAndUtilization` profile was enabled, pods from protected namespaces ([x-]`openshift-*`, `kube-system`, `hypershift`) could be evicted. Pods in these namespaces should never be evicted. With this release, these protected namespaces are now properly excluded from eviction when the `LifecycleAndUtilization` profile is enabled.
