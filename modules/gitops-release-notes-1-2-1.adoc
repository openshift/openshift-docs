== Fixed issues
The following issues were resolved in the current release:

* Previously, huge memory spikes were observed on the application controller on startup. The flag `--kubectl-parallelism-limit` for the application controller is now set to 10 by default, however
this value can be overridden by specifying a number for `.spec.controller.kubeParallelismLimit` in the Argo CD CR specification.

*  The latest Triggers APIs caused Kubernetes build failure due to duplicate entries in the kustomization.yaml when using the `kam bootstrap` command. The Pipelines and Tekton triggers components have now been updated to v0.24.2 and v0.14.2, respectively, to address this issue.

* Persisting RBAC roles and bindings are now automatically removed from the target namespace when the Argo CD instance from the source namespace is deleted.
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-1228[GITOPS-1228]

* Previously, when deploying an Argo CD instance into a namespace, the Argo CD instance would change the "managed-by" label to be its own namespace. This fix would make namespaces unlabelled while also making sure the required RBAC roles and bindings are created and deleted for the namespace.
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-1247[GITOPS-1247]

* Previously, the default resource request limits on Argo CD workloads, specifically for the repo-server and application controller, were found to be very restrictive. The existing resource quota has now been removed and the default memory limit has been increased to 1024M in the repo server. Please note that this change will only affect new installations; existing Argo CD instance workloads will not be affected.
