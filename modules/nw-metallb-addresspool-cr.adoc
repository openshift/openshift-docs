= About the IPAddressPool custom resource

[NOTE]
====
The address pool custom resource definition (CRD) and API documented in "Load balancing with MetalLB" in {product-title} 4.10 can still be used in {product-version}. However, the enhanced functionality associated with advertising an IP address from an `IPAddressPool` with layer 2 protocols, or the BGP protocol, is not supported when using the `AddressPool` CRD.
====

The fields for the `IPAddressPool` custom resource are described in the following tables.

|Field
|Type
|Description

|`metadata.name`
|`string`
|Specifies the name for the address pool.
When you add a service, you can specify this pool name in the `metallb.universe.tf/address-pool` annotation to select an IP address from a specific pool.
The names `doc-example`, `silver`, and `gold` are used throughout the documentation.

|`metadata.namespace`
|`string`
|Specifies the namespace for the address pool.
Specify the same namespace that the MetalLB Operator uses.

|`metadata.label`
|`string`
|Optional: Specifies the key value pair assigned to the `IPAddressPool`. This can be referenced by the `ipAddressPoolSelectors` in the `BGPAdvertisement` and `L2Advertisement` CRD to associate the `IPAddressPool` with the advertisement

|`spec.addresses`
|`string`
|Specifies a list of IP addresses for MetalLB Operator to assign to services.
You can specify multiple ranges in a single pool; they will all share the same settings.
Specify each range in CIDR notation or as starting and ending IP addresses separated with a hyphen.

|`spec.autoAssign`
|`boolean`
|Optional: Specifies whether MetalLB automatically assigns IP addresses from this pool.
Specify `false` if you want explicitly request an IP address from this pool with the `metallb.universe.tf/address-pool` annotation.
The default value is `true`.

|===

You can assign IP addresses from an `IPAddressPool` to services and namespaces by configuring the `spec.serviceAllocation` specification.

|`namespaces`
|`array (string)`
|Optional: Specifies a list of namespaces that you can assign to IP addresses in an IP address pool.

|`namespaceSelectors`
|`array (LabelSelector)`
|Optional: Specifies namespace labels that you can assign to IP addresses from an IP address pool by using label selectors in a list format.

|`serviceSelectors`
|`array (LabelSelector)`
|Optional: Specifies service labels that you can assign to IP addresses from an address pool by using label selectors in a list format.
