= About installing on a single node

An installation of {product-title} on a single node is a specialized installation. The primary use case is for edge computing workloads, including small physical footprints, intermittent connectivity, portable clouds, and 5G radio access networks (RAN) close to a base station. An installation on a single node supports autonomous workloads.

The major trade off with an installation on a single node is the lack of high availability. Currently, Red Hat does not support upgrading {product-title} when installed on a single node. Upgrades and some configuration changes require re-installation.
