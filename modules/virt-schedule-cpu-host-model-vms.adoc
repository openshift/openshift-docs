= Scheduling virtual machines with the host model

When the CPU model for a virtual machine (VM) is set to `host-model`, the VM inherits the CPU model of the node where it is scheduled.

.Procedure

* Edit the `domain` spec of your VM configuration file. The following example shows `host-model` being specified for the virtual machine:
+
[source,yaml]

  template:
    spec:
      domain:

          model: host-model <1>
----
