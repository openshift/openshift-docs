= Scheduling virtual machines with the host model

When the CPU model for a virtual machine (VM) is set to `host-model`, the VM inherits the CPU model of the node where it is scheduled.

.Procedure

* Edit the `domain` spec of your VM configuration file. The following example shows `host-model` being specified for the virtual machine instance (VMI):
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubevirt/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualMachineInstance
metadata:
  name: myvmi
spec:
  domain:
    cpu:
      model: host-model <1>
----
<1> The VM or VMI that inherits the CPU model of the node where it is scheduled.
