= Inserting a CD-ROM in a live VM by using the web console

[role="_abstract"]
To make data on a CD-ROM storage device available to a running virtual machine (VM), create a virtual CD-ROM drive in the VM and insert the CD-ROM into the drive as an ISO image.

Setting up a virtual CD-ROM drive requires rebooting the VM, but you can insert and eject ISO images in the drive while the VM is running.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console, go to *Virtualization* → *VirtualMachines*.

. Click the name of the VM in which you want to insert the CD-ROM.

. On the VM details page, click the *Configuration* tab.

. Open the *Storage* pane.

. Click *Add*.
+
A drop-down menu opens.

. Click *CD-ROM*.

. In the *Name* field, add a name for the CD-ROM drive device.

. Select the ISO image to add to the drive as a CD-ROM volume. To do so, click the drop-down button, and select from the volumes available in the cluster.
+
Alternatively, you can upload a new ISO file and insert it into the CD-ROM drive after it is created. To do so:

.. Ensure that the *Upload a new ISO file to the cluster* line is checked.
.. Drag and drop an ISO file in the *Upload ISO* field, or click *Upload* and select the ISO image that you want to upload.
.. In the *Upload mode* field, select *Mount uploaded ISO as DataVolume*.

. Click *Add*.
+
The CD-ROM drive is added to the *Storage* list.

. If the VM is running, shut it down or restart it.

. To insert the ISO file attached to the CD-ROM drive as a CD-ROM volume into the VM, click the Options menu {kebab} next to the CD-ROM drive, and click *Inject*. You can do this while the VM is running. 

. Optional: In the guest operating system, verify that the CD-ROM has been detected.

. Optional: To eject the CD-ROM from the VM, click the Options menu {kebab} next to the CD-ROM device in the web console, and select *Eject*. You can do this while the VM is running.
