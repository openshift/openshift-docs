= About component limits

[role="_abstract"]
Review the following examples to learn the limit range parameters for each component for when you create or edit a `LimitRange` object. 

The examples are broken out for clarity. You can create a single `LimitRange` object for any or all components as necessary.

Container limits::
A limit range allows you to specify the minimum and maximum CPU and memory that each container in a pod can request for a specific project. If a container is created in the project, the container CPU and memory requests in the `Pod` spec must comply with the values set in the `LimitRange` object. If not, the pod does not get created. The following requirements must hold true:
+
--
* The container CPU or memory request and limit must be greater than or equal to the `min` resource constraint for containers that are specified in the `LimitRange` object.
* The container CPU or memory request and limit must be less than or equal to the `max` resource constraint for containers that are specified in the `LimitRange` object.
--
+
If the `LimitRange` object defines a `max` CPU, you do not need to define a CPU `request` value in the `Pod` spec. But you must specify a CPU `limit` value that satisfies the maximum CPU constraint specified in the limit range. The following requirements must hold true:
+
--
* The ratio of the container limits to requests must be less than or equal to the `maxLimitRequestRatio` value for containers that is specified in the `LimitRange` object.
+
If the `LimitRange` object defines a `maxLimitRequestRatio` constraint, any new containers must have both a `request` and a `limit` value. {product-title} calculates the limit-to-request ratio by dividing the `limit` by the `request`. This value should be a non-negative integer greater than 1.
+
For example, if a container has `cpu: 500` in the `limit` value, and `cpu: 100` in the `request` value, the limit-to-request ratio for `cpu` is `5`. This ratio must be less than or equal to the `maxLimitRequestRatio`.
--
+
If the `Pod` spec does not specify a container resource memory or limit, the `default` or `defaultRequest` CPU and memory values for containers specified in the limit range object are assigned to the container.

Pod limits::
A limit range allows you to specify the minimum and maximum CPU and memory limits for all containers across a pod in a given project. To create a container in the project, the container CPU and memory requests in the `Pod` spec must comply with the values set in the `LimitRange` object. If not, the pod does not get created.
+
If the `Pod` spec does not specify a container resource memory or limit, the `default` or `defaultRequest` CPU and memory values for containers specified in the limit range object are assigned to the container.
+
Across all containers in a pod, the following requirements must hold true:
+
--
* The container CPU or memory request and limit must be greater than or equal to the `min` resource constraints for pods that are specified in the `LimitRange` object.

* The container CPU or memory request and limit must be less than or equal to the `max` resource constraints for pods that are specified in the `LimitRange` object.

* The ratio of the container limits to requests must be less than or equal to the `maxLimitRequestRatio` constraint specified in the `LimitRange` object.

Image limits::
A limit range allows you to specify the maximum size of an image that can be pushed to an {product-registry}.
+
When pushing images to an {product-registry}, the following requirement must hold true:
+
--
* The size of the image must be less than or equal to the `max` size for images that is specified in the `LimitRange` object.

[NOTE]
====
To prevent blobs that exceed the limit from being uploaded to the registry, the registry must be configured to enforce quotas.
====
endif::[]
+
[WARNING]
====
The image size is not always available in the manifest of an uploaded image. This is especially the case for images built with Docker 1.10 or higher and pushed to a v2 registry. If such an image is pulled with an older Docker daemon, the image manifest is converted by the registry to schema v1 lacking all the size information. No storage limit set on images prevent it from being uploaded.

Image stream limits::
A limit range allows you to specify limits for image streams.
+
For each image stream, the following requirements must hold true:
+
--
* The number of image tags in an `ImageStream` specification must be less than or equal to the `openshift.io/image-tags` constraint in the `LimitRange` object.

* The number of unique references to images in an `ImageStream` specification must be less than or equal to the `openshift.io/images` constraint in the limit range object.

`metadata.name`:: Specifies the name of the `LimitRange` object.

`spec.limit.max.openshift.io/images`:: Specifies the maximum number of unique image references in the `imagestream.status.tags` parameter in the `imagestream` spec.
--
+
The `openshift.io/image-tags` resource represents unique image references. Possible references are an `*ImageStreamTag*`, an `*ImageStreamImage*` and a `*DockerImage*`. Tags can be created using the `oc tag` and `oc import-image` commands. No distinction is made between internal and external references. However, each unique reference tagged in an `ImageStream` specification is counted just once. It does not restrict pushes to an internal container image registry in any way, but is useful for tag restriction.
+
The `openshift.io/images` resource represents unique image names recorded in image stream status. It allows for restriction of a specific number of images that can be pushed to the {product-registry}. Internal and external references are not distinguished.

Persistent volume claim limits::
A limit range allows you to restrict the storage requested in a persistent volume claim (PVC).
+
Across all persistent volume claims in a project, the following requirements must hold true:
+
--
* The resource request in a persistent volume claim (PVC) must be greater than or equal the `min` constraint for PVCs that is specified in the `LimitRange` object.

* The resource request in a persistent volume claim (PVC) must be less than or equal the `max` constraint for PVCs that is specified in the `LimitRange` object.
