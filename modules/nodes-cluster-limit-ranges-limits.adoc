= About component limits

The following examples show limit range parameters for each component. The
examples are broken out for clarity. You can create a single `LimitRange` object
for any or all components as necessary.

[id="nodes-cluster-limit-container-limits"]
== Container limits

A limit range allows you to specify the minimum and maximum CPU and memory that each container
in a pod can request for a specific project. If a container is created in the project,
the container CPU and memory requests in the `Pod` spec must comply with the values set in the
`LimitRange` object. If not, the pod does not get created.

* The container CPU or memory request and limit must be greater than or equal to the
`min` resource constraint for containers that are specified in the `LimitRange` object.

* The container CPU or memory request and limit must be less than or equal to the
`max` resource constraint for containers that are specified in the `LimitRange` object.
+
If the `LimitRange` object defines a `max` CPU, you do not need to define a CPU
`request` value in the `Pod` spec. But you must specify a CPU `limit` value that
satisfies the maximum CPU constraint specified in the limit range.

* The ratio of the container limits to requests must be
less than or equal to the `maxLimitRequestRatio` value for containers that
is specified in the `LimitRange` object.
+
If the `LimitRange` object defines a `maxLimitRequestRatio` constraint, any new
containers must have both a `request` and a `limit` value. {product-title}
calculates the limit-to-request ratio by dividing the `limit` by the
`request`. This value should be a non-negative integer greater than 1.
+
For example, if a container has `cpu: 500` in the `limit` value, and
`cpu: 100` in the `request` value, the limit-to-request ratio for `cpu` is
`5`. This ratio must be less than or equal to the `maxLimitRequestRatio`.

If the `Pod` spec does not specify a container resource memory or limit,
the `default` or `defaultRequest` CPU and memory values for containers
specified in the limit range object are assigned to the container.

[id="nodes-cluster-limit-pod-limits"]
== Pod limits

A limit range allows you to specify the minimum and maximum CPU and memory limits for all containers
across a pod in a given project. To create a container in the project, the container CPU and memory
requests in the `Pod` spec must comply with the values set in the `LimitRange` object. If not,
the pod does not get created.

If the `Pod` spec does not specify a container resource memory or limit,
the `default` or `defaultRequest` CPU and memory values for containers
specified in the limit range object are assigned to the container.

Across all containers in a pod, the following must hold true:

* The container CPU or memory request and limit must be greater than or equal to the
`min` resource constraints for pods that are specified in the `LimitRange` object.

* The container CPU or memory request and limit must be less than or equal to the
`max` resource constraints for pods that are specified in the `LimitRange` object.

* The ratio of the container limits to requests must be less than or equal to
the `maxLimitRequestRatio` constraint specified in the `LimitRange` object.

[id="nodes-cluster-limit-image-limits"]
== Image limits

A `LimitRange` object allows you to specify the maximum size of an image
that can be pushed to an internal registry.

When pushing images to an internal registry, the following must hold true:

* The size of the image must be less than or equal to the `max` size for
images that is specified in the `LimitRange` object.

<2> The maximum size of an image that can be pushed to an internal registry.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
[NOTE]
====
To prevent blobs that exceed the limit from being uploaded to the registry, the
registry must be configured to enforce quotas.
====
endif::[]

[WARNING]
====
The image size is not always available in the manifest of an uploaded image.
This is especially the case for images built with Docker 1.10 or higher and
pushed to a v2 registry. If such an image is pulled with an older Docker daemon,
the image manifest is converted by the registry to schema v1 lacking all
the size information. No storage limit set on images prevent it from being
uploaded.

link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/issues/7706[The issue] is being
addressed.

[id="nodes-cluster-limit-stream-limits"]
== Image stream limits

A `LimitRange` object allows you to specify limits for image streams.

For each image stream, the following must hold true:

* The number of image tags in an `ImageStream` specification must be less
than or equal to the `openshift.io/image-tags` constraint in the `LimitRange` object.

* The number of unique references to images in an `ImageStream` specification
must be less than or equal to the `openshift.io/images` constraint in the limit
range object.

.Imagestream `LimitRange` object definition

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "LimitRange"
metadata:
  name: "resource-limits" <1>
spec:
  limits:
    - type: openshift.io/ImageStream
      max:
        openshift.io/image-tags: 20 <2>
        openshift.io/images: 30 <3>
----
<1> The name of the `LimitRange` object.
<2> The maximum number of unique image tags in the `imagestream.spec.tags`
parameter in imagestream spec.
<3> The maximum number of unique image references in the `imagestream.status.tags`
parameter in the `imagestream` spec.

The `openshift.io/image-tags` resource represents unique image
references. Possible references are an `*ImageStreamTag*`, an
`*ImageStreamImage*` and a `*DockerImage*`. Tags can be created using
the `oc tag` and `oc import-image` commands. No distinction
is made between internal and external references. However, each unique reference
tagged in an `ImageStream` specification is counted just once. It does not
restrict pushes to an internal container image registry in any way, but is useful for tag
restriction.

The `openshift.io/images` resource represents unique image names recorded in
image stream status. It allows for restriction of a number of images that can be
pushed to the internal registry. Internal and external references are not
distinguished.

[id="nodes-cluster-limit-pvc-limits"]
== Persistent volume claim limits

A `LimitRange` object allows you to restrict the storage requested in a persistent volume claim (PVC).

Across all persistent volume claims in a project, the following must hold true:

* The resource request in a persistent volume claim (PVC) must be greater than or equal
the `min` constraint for PVCs that is specified in the `LimitRange` object.

* The resource request in a persistent volume claim (PVC) must be less than or equal
the `max` constraint for PVCs that is specified in the `LimitRange` object.
