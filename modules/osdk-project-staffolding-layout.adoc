[id="osdk-project-scaffolding-layout_{context}"]
= Operator project scaffolding layout

The `operator-sdk` CLI generates a number of packages for each Operator project. The following sections describes a basic rundown of each generated file and directory.

[id="osdk-project-scaffolding-layout-go_{context}"]
== Go-based projects

Go-based Operator projects (the default type) generated using the `operator-sdk new` command contain the following directories and files:

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===

|File/folders |Purpose

|`cmd/`
|Contains `manager/main.go` file, which is the main program of the Operator. This instantiates a new manager which registers all custom resource defintitions (CRDs) under `pkg/apis/` and starts all controllers under `pkg/controllers/`.

|`pkg/apis/`
|Contains the directory tree that defines the APIs of the CRDs. Users are expected to edit the `pkg/apis/<group>/<version>/<kind>_types.go` files to define the API for each resource type and import these packages in their controllers to watch for these resource types.

|`pkg/controller`
|This `pkg` contains the controller implementations. Users are expected to edit the `pkg/controller/<kind>/<kind>_controller.go` files to define the reconcile logic of the controller for handling a resource type of the specified kind.

|`build/`
|Contains the Dockerfile and build scripts used to build the Operator.

|`deploy/`
|Contains various YAML manifests for registering CRDs, setting up RBAC, and deploying the Operator as a deployment.

a|`Gopkg.toml` +
`Gopkg.lock`
|The link:https://github.com/golang/dep[Go Dep] manifests that describe the external dependencies of this Operator.

|`vendor/`
|The Golang link:https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Vendor_Directories[vendor] folder that contains the local copies of the external dependencies that satisfy the imports of this project. link:https://github.com/golang/dep[Go Dep] manages the vendor directly.

[id="osdk-project-scaffolding-layout-helm_{context}"]
== Helm-based projects

Helm-based Operator projects generated using the `operator-sdk new --type helm` command contain the following directories and files:

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===

|File/folders |Purpose

|`deploy/`
|Contains various YAML manifests for registering CRDs, setting up RBAC, and deploying the Operator as a Deployment.

|`helm-charts/<kind>`
|Contains a Helm chart initialized using the equivalent of the `helm create` command.

|`build/`
|Contains the Dockerfile and build scripts used to build the Operator.

|`watches.yaml`
|Contains group/version/kind (GVK) and Helm chart location.
