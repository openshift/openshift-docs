= Enabling active-backup mode for your cluster

For `active-backup` mode, the bond interfaces exist in the same data path as the OVS bridge interface, so the OVS bridge can manage bonding logic instead of the physcial interfaces manages traffic. This mode provides link aggregation capabilities for your network, where one physical interface acts as the active port while other physical interfaces act as standby ports. This mode provides fault tolerance connections for your network.

Red Hat supports only the following value for the `fail_over_mac` parameter:

* `0`: Specifies the `none` value and this is the default value that disables MAC address failover so that all compute nodes receive the same MAC address as the bond interface. With this setting, packets might be sent to inactive nodes.

Red Hat does not support the following values for the `fail_over_mac` parameter:

* `1`: Specifies the `active` value and sets the MAC address of the primary bond interface to always remain the same as active nodes. If during a failover, the MAC address of a node changes, the MAC address of the bond interface changes to match the new MAC address of the node.
* `2`: Specifies the `follow` value so that during a failover, an active node gets the MAC address of the bond interface and a formerly active node receives the MAC address of the newly active node.
