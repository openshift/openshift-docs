= Working with data in the Kiali console

From the *Graph* menu in the Kiali console, you can use the following graphs and viewing tools to gain deeper insights about data that travels through your service mesh. These tools can help you identify problems with services or workloads.

There are several graphs to choose from:

* The *App graph* shows an aggregate workload for all applications that are labeled the same.

* The *Versioned App graph* shows a node for each version of an application. All versions of an application are grouped together.

* The *Workload graph* shows a node for each workload in your service mesh. This graph does not require you to use the application and version labels. If your application does not use version labels, use this the graph.

* The *Service graph* shows a node for each service in your mesh but excludes all applications and workloads from the graph. It provides a high level view and aggregates all traffic for defined services.

To view a summary of metrics, select any node or edge in the graph to display its metric details in the summary details panel.

== Namespace graphs

The namespace graph is a map of the services, deployments, and workflows in your namespace and arrows that show how data flows through them.

.Prerequisites

* Install the Bookinfo sample application.

.Procedure

. Send traffic to the mesh by entering the following command several times.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl "http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage"
----
+
This command simulates a user visiting the `productpage` microservice of the application.

. In the main navigation, click *Graph* to view a namespace graph.

. Select `bookinfo` from the *Namespace* menu.
