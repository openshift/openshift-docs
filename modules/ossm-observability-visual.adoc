= Visualizing your service

The Kiali operator works with the telemetry data gathered in {ProductName} to provide graphs and real time network diagrams of the applications, services, and workloads in your namespace.

The Overview page displays all the namespaces that have services in your mesh. You can reveal deeper insights about the data traveling through your Service mesh or help identify problems with services or workloads in your service mesh with the following graphs and visualizations.

== Namespace graphs

The namespace graph is a map of the services, deployments and workflows in your namespace and arrows that show how data flows through them. To view a namespace graph:

1. Click *Graph* in the main navigation.
+
2. Select `bookinfo` from the *Namespace* menu.


If your application uses version tags, like the Bookinfo sample application, you can see a Version graph. Select a graph from the Graph Type drop down menu. There are several graphs to choose from:

* The App graph shows an aggregate workload for all applications that are labeled the same.

* The Versioned App graph shows a node for each version of an app. All versions of an app are grouped together.

* The Workload graph shows a node for each workload in your service mesh. This graph does not require you to use the app and version labels. If your app does not use version labels, use this the graph.

* The Service graph shows a node for each service in your mesh but excludes all apps and workloads from the graph. It provides a high level view and aggregates all traffic for defined services.

To view a summary of metrics, select any node or edge in the graph to display its metric details in the summary details panel.
