= Understanding the Cluster Application Migration tool

The Cluster Application Migration (CAM) tool enables you to migrate Kubernetes resources, persistent volume data, and internal container images from an {product-title} source cluster to an {product-title}  target cluster, using the CAM web console or the Kubernetes API.

Migrating an application with the CAM web console involves the following steps:

. Installing the CAM Operator on the source and target clusters
+
[NOTE]
====
The CAM Operator installs the CAM web console on the target cluster by default.
====

. Configuring cross-origin resource sharing on the source cluster
. Adding the source cluster to the CAM web console
. Adding an S3 replication repository to the CAM web console
. Creating a migration plan, with one of the following options:

* *Copy* copies the data in a source cluster's PV to the replication repository and then restores it on a newly created PV, with similar characteristics, in the target cluster. You can change the storage class during migration.

* *Move* unmounts a remote volume (for example, NFS) from the source cluster, creates a PV resource on the target cluster pointing to the remote volume, and then mounts the remote volume on the target cluster. Applications running on the target cluster use the same remote volume that the source cluster was using. The remote volume must be accessible to the source and target clusters.
+
[NOTE]
====
Although the replication repository does not appear in this diagram, it is required for the actual migration.

. Running the migration plan, with one of the following options:

* *Stage* (optional) copies data to the target cluster without stopping the application.
+
Staging can be run multiple times so that most of the data is copied to the target before migration. This minimizes the actual migration time and application downtime.

* *Migrate* stops the application workload on the source cluster and recreates its resources on the target cluster. Optionally, you can choose to keep the application running when you migrate the workload.
