= Configuring the Cloud Credential Operator utility

To create and manage cloud credentials from outside of the cluster when the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) is operating in manual mode with STS, extract and prepare the CCO utility (`ccoctl`) binary.

[NOTE]
====
The `ccoctl` is a Linux binary that must run in a Linux environment.
====

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the {product-title} release image.

.Procedure

. Get the CCO container image from the {product-title} release image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ CCO_IMAGE=$(oc adm release info --image-for='cloud-credential-operator' $RELEASE_IMAGE)
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Ensure that the architecture of the `$RELEASE_IMAGE` matches the architecture of the environment in which you will use the `ccoctl` tool.
====

. Extract the `ccoctl` binary from the CCO container image within the {product-title} release image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc image extract $CCO_IMAGE --file="/usr/bin/ccoctl" -a ~/.pull-secret
----

. Change the permissions to make `ccoctl` executable:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ chmod 775 ccoctl
----

.Verification

* To verify that `ccoctl` is ready to use, display the help file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ccoctl aws --help
----
+
.Output of `ccoctl aws --help`:
+
[source,terminal]
