ifndef::update[= Configuring the Cloud Credential Operator utility]

//This applies only to Alibaba Cloud.
ifdef::alibabacloud[]
To assign RAM users and policies that provide long-lived RAM AccessKeys (AKs) for each in-cluster component, extract and prepare the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) utility (`ccoctl`) binary.
endif::alibabacloud[]

//Nutanix-only intro because it needs context in its install procedure.
ifdef::nutanix[]
The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) manages cloud provider credentials as Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs). To install a cluster on Nutanix, you must set the CCO to `manual` mode as part of the installation process.
endif::nutanix[]
ifdef::ibm-power-vs[]
The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) manages cloud provider credentials as Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs). To install a cluster on {ibmpowerProductName} Virtual Server, you must set the CCO to `manual` mode as part of the installation process.
endif::ibm-power-vs[]

//Alibaba Cloud uses ccoctl, but creates different kinds of resources than other clouds, so this applies to everyone else. The upgrade procs also have a different intro, so they are excluded here.
ifndef::alibabacloud,update[]
To create and manage cloud credentials from outside of the cluster when the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) is operating in manual mode, extract and prepare the CCO utility (`ccoctl`) binary.
endif::alibabacloud,update[]

//Intro for the upgrade procs.
ifdef::update[]
To upgrade a cluster that uses the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) in manual mode to create and manage cloud credentials from outside of the cluster, extract and prepare the CCO utility (`ccoctl`) binary.
endif::update[]

[NOTE]
====
The `ccoctl` utility is a Linux binary that must run in a Linux environment.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} account with cluster administrator access.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

//Upgrade prereqs
ifdef::update[]
* Your cluster was configured using the `ccoctl` utility to create and manage cloud credentials from outside of the cluster.
endif::update[]

//AWS permissions needed when running ccoctl during install (I think we can omit from upgrade, since they already have an appropriate AWS account if they are upgrading).
ifdef::aws-sts[]
* You have created an AWS account for the `ccoctl` utility to use with the following permissions:

.Procedure

. Obtain the {product-title} release image by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
----

. Obtain the CCO container image from the {product-title} release image by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ CCO_IMAGE=$(oc adm release info --image-for='cloud-credential-operator' $RELEASE_IMAGE -a ~/.pull-secret)
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Ensure that the architecture of the `$RELEASE_IMAGE` matches the architecture of the environment in which you will use the `ccoctl` tool.
====

. Extract the `ccoctl` binary from the CCO container image within the {product-title} release image by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc image extract $CCO_IMAGE --file="/usr/bin/ccoctl" -a ~/.pull-secret
----

. Change the permissions to make `ccoctl` executable by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ chmod 775 ccoctl
----

.Verification

* To verify that `ccoctl` is ready to use, display the help file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ccoctl --help
----
+
.Output of `ccoctl --help`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
OpenShift credentials provisioning tool
