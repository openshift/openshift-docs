= Using a NodePort to get traffic into the cluster

Use a `NodePort`-type `Service` resource to expose a service on a specific port
on all nodes in the cluster. The port is specified in the `Service` resource's
`.spec.ports[*].nodePort` field.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Using a node port requires additional port resources.
====

A `NodePort` exposes the service on a static port on the node's IP address.
``NodePort``s are in the `30000` to `32767` range by default, which means a
`NodePort` is unlikely to match a serviceâ€™s intended port. For example, port
`8080` may be exposed as port `31020` on the node.

The administrator must ensure the external IP addresses are routed to the nodes.

``NodePort``s and external IPs are independent and both can be used
concurrently.
