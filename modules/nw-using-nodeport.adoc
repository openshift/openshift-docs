= Using a NodePort to get traffic into the cluster

[role="_abstract"]
Use a `NodePort`-type `Service` resource to expose a service on a specific port on all nodes in the cluster. 

The port is specified in the `Service` resource's `.spec.ports[*].nodePort` parameter

[IMPORTANT]
====
Using a node port requires additional port resources.
====

A `NodePort` exposes the service on a static port on the IP address of a node. A `NodePort` spans the `30000` to `32767` IP address ranges by default, which means a `NodePort` is unlikely to match the intended port of a service. For example, port `8080` might be exposed as port `31020` on the node.

The administrator must ensure the external IP addresses are routed to the nodes.

A `NodePort` and external IPs are independent and both can be used concurrently.
