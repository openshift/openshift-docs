= Flow filter configuration parameters
The flow filter rules consist of required and optional parameters.

.Required configuration parameters
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|`enable`
| Set `enable` to `true` to enable the eBPF flow filtering feature.

|`cidr`
| Provides the IP address and CIDR mask for the flow filter rule. Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 address format. If you want to match against any IP, you can use `0.0.0.0/0` for IPv4 or `::/0` for IPv6.

|`action`
| Describes the action that is taken for the flow filter rule. The possible values are `Accept` or `Reject`.

* For the `Accept` action matching rule, the flow data is cached in the eBPF table and updated with the global metric, `FlowFilterAcceptCounter`.
* For the `Reject` action matching rule, the flow data is dropped and not cached in the eBPF table. The flow data is updated with the global metric, `FlowFilterRejectCounter`.
* If the rule is not matched, the flow is cached in the eBPF table and updated with the global metric, `FlowFilterNoMatchCounter`.

.Optional configuration parameters
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|`direction`
| Defines the direction of the flow filter rule. Possible values are `Ingress` or `Egress`.

|`protocol`
| Defines the protocol of the flow filter rule. Possible values are `TCP`, `UDP`, `SCTP`, `ICMP`, and `ICMPv6`.

| `ports`
| Defines the ports to use for filtering flows. It can be used for either source or destination ports. To filter a single port, set a single port as an integer value. For example `ports: 80`. To filter a range of ports, use a "start-end" range in string format. For example `ports: "80-100"`

|`sourcePorts`
| Defines the source port to use for filtering flows. To filter a single port, set a single port as an integer value, for example `sourcePorts: 80`. To filter a range of ports, use a "start-end" range, string format, for example `sourcePorts: "80-100"`.


| `destPorts`
| DestPorts defines the destination ports to use for filtering flows. To filter a single port, set a single port as an integer value, for example `destPorts: 80`. To filter a range of ports, use a "start-end" range in string format, for example `destPorts: "80-100"`.

| `icmpType`
| Defines the ICMP type to use for filtering flows.

| `icmpCode`
| Defines the ICMP code to use for filtering flows.

| `peerIP`
|  Defines the IP address to use for filtering flows, for example: `10.10.10.10`.
