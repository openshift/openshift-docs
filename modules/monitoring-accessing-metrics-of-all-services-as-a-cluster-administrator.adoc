= Accessing metrics of all services as a cluster administrator

If you are a cluster administrator or a user with view permissions for all namespaces, you can access metrics of all services from all namespaces together in a single view.

.Prerequisites

* Log in to the web console as a cluster administrator or a user with view permissions for all namespaces.
* Optionally, log in with the `oc` command as well.

.Procedure

* Using the Metrics web interface:
+
--
. Go to the {product-title} web console, switch to the Administrator Perspective, and click *Monitoring* -> *Metrics*.
+
[NOTE]
====
Cluster administrators, when using the Administrator Perspective, have access to all cluster metrics and to custom service metrics from all projects.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
Only cluster administrators have access to the third-party UIs provided with {product-title} Monitoring.
====

. Use the PromQL interface to run queries for your services.

* Using the Thanos Querier UI:
+
[NOTE]
====
In a future release, the route to the Thanos Querier UI will be deprecated in favor of the web console.
====
+
--
. List routes for the `openshift-monitoring` namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring get routes

The output shows the URL for the Thanos Querier UI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                HOST/PORT
...
thanos-querier      thanos-querier-openshift-monitoring.apps.example.devcluster.openshift.com
