.Procedure

* Run the following command to check the build-time violations of your security policies in images:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ roxctl image check --image=_<image_name>_
----
The format is defined in the API reference.
To cause {rh-rhacs-first} to re-pull image metadata and image scan results from the associated registry and scanner, add the `--force` option. 
+
This command queries Central and Scanner to check the input image against a set of policies. If the image violates any build-time policy of the requested policy set, which is by default all policies, then the FAIL_BUILD_ENFORCEMENT flag is set. The check result is an error with the return code of 1.
+
[NOTE]
====
To check specific image scan results, you must have a token with both `read` and `write` permissions for the `Image` resource.
The default *Continuous Integration* system role already has the required permissions.
//TODO: Add link to the system role topic.
