.Procedure

* Run the following command to check the build-time violations of your security policies in images:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ roxctl image check --image=_<image_name>_
----
+
The format is defined in the API reference.
To cause {rh-rhacs-first} to re-pull image metadata and image scan results from the associated registry and scanner, add the `--force` option.
+
[NOTE]
====
To check specific image scan results, you must have a token with both `read` and `write` permissions for the `Image` resource.
The default *Continuous Integration* system role already has the required permissions.
//TODO: Add link to the system role topic.
