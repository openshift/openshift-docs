= Mandatory upgrades

In the event that a Critical or Important CVE, or other bug identified by Red Hat, significantly
impacts the security or stability of the cluster, the customer must upgrade to the next supported
patch release within two link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2623321[business days].

In extreme circumstances and based on Red Hat's assessment of the CVE criticality to the
environment, Red Hat will notify customers that they have two link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2623321[business days] to schedule or manually update their cluster to the latest, secure patch release. In the case that an update has not been performed, Red Hat will automatically update the cluster to the latest, secure patch release to mitigate potential security breach(es) or instability. Red Hat may, at its own discretion, temporarily delay an automated update if requested by a customer through a link:https://access.redhat.com/support[support case].
