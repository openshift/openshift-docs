= Mandatory upgrades

In the event that a Critical or Important CVE, or other bug identified by Red Hat, significantly
impacts the security or stability of the cluster, the customer must upgrade to the next supported
patch release within 48 hours.

In extreme circumstances and based on Red Hat's assessment of the CVE criticality to the
environment, if the upgrade to the next supported patch release has not been performed within 48
hours of notification, the cluster will be automatically updated to the latest patch release to
mitigate potential security breach or instability.
