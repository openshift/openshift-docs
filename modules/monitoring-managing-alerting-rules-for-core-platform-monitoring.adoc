= Managing alerting rules for core platform monitoring

[role="_abstract"]
The {ocp} monitoring includes a large set of default alerting rules for platform metrics.
As a cluster administrator, you can customize this set of rules in two ways:

* Modify the settings for existing platform alerting rules by adjusting thresholds or by adding and modifying labels.
For example, you can change the `severity` label for an alert from `warning` to `critical` to help you route and triage issues flagged by an alert.

* Define and add new custom alerting rules by constructing a query expression based on core platform metrics in the `openshift-monitoring` project.
