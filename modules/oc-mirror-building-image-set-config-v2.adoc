= Creating the image set configuration

Before you can use the oc-mirror plugin v2 to mirror images, you must create an image set configuration file.
This image set configuration file defines which {product-title} releases, Operators, and other images to mirror, along with other configuration settings for the oc-mirror plugin v2.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a container image registry credentials file.
For instructions, see _Configuring credentials that allow images to be mirrored_.

.Procedure

* Create an `ImageSetConfiguration` YAML file and modify it to include your required images.

<1> Set the channel to retrieve {product-title} images from.
<2> Add `graph: true` to build and push the graph-data image to the mirror registry.
The graph-data image is required to create OpenShift Update Service (OSUS).
The `graph: true` field also generates the `UpdateService` custom resource manifest.
The `oc` command-line interface (CLI) can use the `UpdateService` custom resource manifest to create OSUS.
For more information, see _About the OpenShift Update Service_.
<3> Set the Operator catalog to retrieve the {product-title} images from.
<4> Specify only certain Operator packages to include in the image set. Remove this field to retrieve all packages in the catalog.
<5> Specify any additional images to include in image set.

// Are there more relevant example version numbers we can use in the example above?
// Also, are there any other callouts that would be helpful for users here?
