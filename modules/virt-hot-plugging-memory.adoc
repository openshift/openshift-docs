= Hot plugging memory on a virtual machine

You can add or remove the amount of memory allocated to a virtual machine (VM) without having to restart the VM by using the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Virtualization* -> *VirtualMachines*.
. Select the required VM to open the *VirtualMachine details* page.
. On the *Configuration* tab, click *Edit CPU|Memory*.
. Enter the desired amount of memory and click *Save*.

The system applies these changes immediately. If the VM is migratable, a live migration is triggered. If not, or if the changes cannot be live-updated, a `RestartRequired` condition is added to the VM.

[NOTE]
====
* Linux guests require a kernel version of 5.16 or later and Windows guests require the latest `viomem` drivers.
* By default, a virtual machine (VM) can be hot-plugged with up to four times its initially assigned CPU count. For example, a VM with 1 vCPU can scale up to 4 vCPUs before a restart is required. If the VM is migratable, the change is applied through live migration. If not, or if the change cannot be live-updated, a restart is required.
You can modify this limit cluster-wide using the `maxHotplugRatio` parameter or override it on a per-VM basis.
