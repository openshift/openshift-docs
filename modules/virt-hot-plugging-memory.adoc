= Hot plugging memory on a virtual machine

You can add or remove the amount of memory allocated to a virtual machine (VM) without having to restart the VM by using the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Virtualization* -> *VirtualMachines*.
. Select the required VM to open the *VirtualMachine details* page.
. On the *Configuration* tab, click *Edit CPU|Memory*.
. Enter the desired amount of memory and click *Save*.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can hot plug up to three times the default initial amount of memory of the VM. Exceeding this limit requires a restart.
====
The system applies these changes immediately. If the VM is migratable, a live migration is triggered. If not, or if the changes cannot be live-updated, a `RestartRequired` condition is added to the VM.

[NOTE]
====
Memory hot plugging for virtual machines requires guest operating system support for the `virtio-mem` driver. This support depends on the driver being included and enabled within the guest operating system, not on specific upstream kernel versions.

Supported guest operating systems:

* RHEL 9.4 and later
* RHEL 8.10 and later (hot-unplug is disabled by default)
* Other Linux guests require kernel version 5.16 or later and the `virtio-mem` kernel module
* Windows guests require `virtio-mem` driver version 100.95.104.26200 or later
