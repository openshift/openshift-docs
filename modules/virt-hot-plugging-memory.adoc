= Hot plugging memory on a virtual machine

You can add or remove the amount of memory allocated to a virtual machine (VM) without having to restart the VM by using the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Virtualization* -> *VirtualMachines*.
. Select the required VM to open the *VirtualMachine details* page.
. On the *Configuration* tab, click *Edit CPU|Memory*.
. Enter the desired amount of memory and click *Save*.

The system applies these changes immediately. If the VM is migratable, a live migration is triggered. If not, or if the changes cannot be live-updated, a `RestartRequired` condition is added to the VM.

[NOTE]
====
* Linux guests require a kernel version of 5.16 or later and Windows guests require the latest `viomem` drivers.
* By default, you can hot-plug a VM with up to 4 times its initial CPU or memory configuration. For example, a VM with 1 vCPU and 2 GiB memory can scale up to 4 vCPUs and 8 GiB before a restart is needed. You can adjust this behavior cluster-wide by using the `maxHotplugRatio` parameter or override it in your VM.
