= Gathering information to troubleshoot hosted control planes

When you need to troubleshoot an issue with hosted control plane clusters, you can gather information by running the `hypershift dump cluster` command. The command generates output for the management cluster and the hosted cluster.

The output for the management cluster contains the following content:

* *Cluster-scoped resources:* These resources are node definitions of the management cluster.
* *The `hypershift-dump` compressed file:* This file is useful if you need to share the content with other people.
* *Namespaced resources:* These resources include all of the objects from the relevant namespaces, such as config maps, services, events, and logs.
* *Network logs:* These logs include the OVN northbound and southbound databases and the status for each one.
* *Hosted clusters:* This level of output involves all of the resources inside of the hosted cluster.

The output for the hosted cluster contains the following content:

* *Cluster-scoped resources:* These resources include all of the cluster-wide objects, such as nodes and CRDs.
* *Namespaced resources:* These resources include all of the objects from the relevant namespaces, such as config maps, services, events, and logs.

Although the output does not contain any secret objects from the cluster, it can contain references to the names of secrets.

.Prerequisites

* You must have `cluster-admin` access to the management cluster.

* You need the `name` value for the `HostedCluster` resource and the namespace where the CR is deployed.

* You must have the `hcp` command line interface installed. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.9/html/clusters/cluster_mce_overview#hosted-install-cli[Installing the hosted control planes command line interface].

* You must have the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) installed.

* You must ensure that the `kubeconfig` file is loaded and is pointing to the management cluster.

.Procedure

* To gather output for troubleshooting, enter the following commands:

[source,terminal]
----
$ CLUSTERNAME="samplecluster"
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ CLUSTERNS="clusters"
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir clusterDump-${CLUSTERNS}-${CLUSTERNAME}
----

----
$ hypershift dump cluster \
    --name ${CLUSTERNAME} \
    --namespace ${CLUSTERNS} \
    --dump-guest-cluster \
    --artifact-dir clusterDump-${CLUSTERNS}-${CLUSTERNAME}

[source,terminal]
----
2023-06-06T12:18:20+02:00   INFO    Archiving dump  {"command": "tar", "args": ["-cvzf", "hypershift-dump.tar.gz", "cluster-scoped-resources", "event-filter.html", "namespaces", "network_logs", "timestamp"]}
2023-06-06T12:18:21+02:00   INFO    Successfully archived dump  {"duration": "1.519376292s"}
----

* To configure the command-line interface so that it impersonates all of the queries against the management cluster by using a username or service account, enter the `hypershift dump cluster` command with the `--as` flag.
+
The service account must have enough permissions to query all of the objects from the namespaces, so the `cluster-admin` role is recommended to make sure you have enough permissions. The service account must be located in or have permissions to query the namespace of the `HostedControlPlane` resource.
+
If your username or service account does not have enough permissions, the output contains only the objects that you have permissions to access. During that process, you might see `forbidden` errors.
+
