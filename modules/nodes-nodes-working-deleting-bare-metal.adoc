= Deleting nodes from a bare metal cluster

When you delete a node using the CLI, the node object is deleted in Kubernetes,
but the pods that exist on the node are not deleted. Any bare pods not backed by
a replication controller become inaccessible to {product-title}. Pods backed by
replication controllers are rescheduled to other available nodes. You must
delete local manifest pods.

.Procedure

Delete a node from an {product-title} cluster running on bare metal by completing
the following steps:

. Mark the node as unschedulable:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm cordon <node_name>
----

. Drain all pods on your node:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm drain <node_name> --force=true
----

. Delete your node from the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete node <node_name>
----

Although the node object is now deleted from the cluster, it can still rejoin
the cluster after reboot or if the kubelet service is restarted. To permanently
delete the node and all its data, you must
