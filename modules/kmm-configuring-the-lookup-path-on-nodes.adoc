= Configuring the lookup path on nodes

On {product-title} nodes, the set of default lookup paths for firmwares does not include the `/var/lib/firmware` path.

Since version 2.0.0, KMM workers can set that value on nodes by writing to sysfs, before attempting to load kmods.
To enable that feature, set `worker.setFirmwareClassPath` to `/var/lib/firmware` in the <<kmm-configure_{context},operator configuration>>.
