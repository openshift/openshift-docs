= Modifying retention time for Prometheus metrics data

By default, the Prometheus Cluster Monitoring stack configures the retention time for Prometheus data to be 15 days. You can modify the retention time to change how soon the data is deleted.

.Prerequisites

* Make sure you have the `cluster-monitoring-config` ConfigMap object with the `data/config.yaml` section.

.Procedure

. Start editing the `cluster-monitoring-config` ConfigMap:
+
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

. Put your retention time configuration under `data/config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      retention: <time_specification>
----
+
Substitute `<time_specification>` with a number directly followed by `ms` (milliseconds), `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), `d` (days), `w` (weeks), or `y` (years).
+
For example, to configure retention time to be 24 hours, use:
+
[source,yaml,subs=quotes]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      retention: *24h*
----

. Save the file to apply the changes. The pods affected by the new configuration are restarted automatically.
