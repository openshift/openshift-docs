= Modifying the retention time for Prometheus metrics data

By default, the {product-title} monitoring stack configures the retention time for Prometheus data to be 15 days. You can modify the retention time to change how soon the data is deleted.

.Prerequisites

* *If you are configuring core {product-title} monitoring components*:
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
** You have created the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* *If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects*:
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role, or as a user with the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.
** You have created the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Edit the `ConfigMap` object:
** *To modify the retention time for the Prometheus instance that monitors core {product-title} projects*:
.. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

.. Add your retention time configuration under `data/config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      retention: <time_specification>
----
+
Substitute `<time_specification>` with a number directly followed by `ms` (milliseconds), `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), `d` (days), `w` (weeks), or `y` (years).
+
The following example sets the retention time to 24 hours for the Prometheus instance that monitors core {product-title} components:
+
[source,yaml,subs=quotes]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      retention: *24h*
----

** *To modify the retention time for the Prometheus instance that monitors user-defined projects*:
.. Edit the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
----

.. Add your retention time configuration under `data/config.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus:
      retention: <time_specification>
----
+
Substitute `<time_specification>` with a number directly followed by `ms` (milliseconds), `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), `d` (days), `w` (weeks), or `y` (years).
+
The following example sets the retention time to 24 hours for the Prometheus instance that monitors user-defined projects:
+
[source,yaml,subs=quotes]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus:
      retention: *24h*
----

. Save the file to apply the changes. The pods affected by the new configuration are restarted automatically.
+
[NOTE]
====
Configurations applied to the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object are not activated unless a cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
====
+
[WARNING]
====
When changes are saved to a monitoring config map, the pods and other resources in the related project might be redeployed. The running monitoring processes in that project might also be restarted.
