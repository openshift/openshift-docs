= Build snapshot

For each build run reconciliation, the `buildSpec` field in the status of the `BuildRun` resource updates if an existing task run is part of that build run. 

During this update, a `Build` resource snapshot generates and embeds into the `status.buildSpec` field of the `BuildRun` resource. Due to this, the `buildSpec` field contains an exact  copy of the original `Build` specification, which was used to execute a particular image build. By using the build snapshot, you can see the original `Build` resource configuration.
