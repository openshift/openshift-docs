= Build snapshot

[role="_abstract"]
For each build run reconciliation, the `buildSpec` field in the status of the `BuildRun` resource updates if an existing task run is part of that build run. 

A Build snapshot is generated and stored in the BuildRun status.buildSpec during updates. Due to this, the `buildSpec` field contains an exact  copy of the original `Build` specification, which was used to execute a particular image build. By using the build snapshot, you can see the original `Build` resource configuration.
