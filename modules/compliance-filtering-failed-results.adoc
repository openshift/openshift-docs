= Filters for failed compliance check results

By default, the `ComplianceCheckResult` objects are labeled with several useful labels that allow you to query the checks and decide on the next steps after the results are generated.

List checks that belong to a specific suite:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get compliancecheckresults -l compliance.openshift.io/suite=example-compliancesuite
----

List checks that belong to a specific scan:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get compliancecheckresults -l compliance.openshift.io/scan=example-compliancescan
----

Not all `ComplianceCheckResult` objects create `ComplianceRemediation` objects. Only `ComplianceCheckResult` objects that can be remediated automatically do. A `ComplianceCheckResult` object has a related remediation if it is labeled with the `compliance.openshift.io/automated-remediation` label. The name of the remediation is the same as the name of the check.

List all failing checks that can be remediated automatically:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get compliancecheckresults -l 'compliance.openshift.io/check-status=FAIL,compliance.openshift.io/automated-remmediation'
----

List all failing checks that must be remediated manually:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get compliancecheckresults -l 'compliance.openshift.io/check-status=FAIL,!compliance.openshift.io/automated-remediation'
----

The manual remediation steps are typically stored in the `description` attribute in the `ComplianceCheckResult` object.
