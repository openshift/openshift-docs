= Specifying VLAN IDs in group PolicyGenTemplate CRs with hub cluster templates

You can manage VLAN IDs for managed clusters in a single `ConfigMap` CR and use hub cluster templates to populate the VLAN IDs in the generated polices that get applied to the clusters.

The following example shows how you how manage VLAN IDs in single `ConfigMap` CR and apply them in individual cluster polices by using a single `PolicyGenTemplate` group CR.

[NOTE]
====
When using the `fromConfigmap` function, the `printf` variable is only available for the template resource `data` key fields.
You cannot use it with `name` and `namespace` fields.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data.
The repository must be accessible from the hub cluster and be defined as a source repository for the Argo CD application.

.Procedure

. Create a `ConfigMap` CR that describes the VLAN IDs for a group of cluster hosts. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: site-data
  namespace: ztp-group
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Replace=true <1>
data:
  site-1-vlan: "101"
  site-2-vlan: "234"
----
<1> The `argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options` annotation is required only if the `ConfigMap` is larger than 1 MiB in size.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `ConfigMap` must be in the same namespace with the policy that has the hub template substitution.
====

. Commit the `ConfigMap` CR in Git, and then push to the Git repository being monitored by the Argo CD application.

. Create a group PGT CR that uses a hub template to pull the required VLAN IDs from the `ConfigMap` object. For example, add the following YAML snippet to the group PGT CR:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- fileName: SriovNetwork.yaml
    policyName: "config-policy"
    metadata:
      name: "sriov-nw-du-mh"
      annotations:
        ran.openshift.io/ztp-deploy-wave: "10"
    spec:
      resourceName: du_mh
      vlan: '{{hub fromConfigMap "" "site-data" (printf "%s-vlan" .ManagedClusterName) | toInt hub}}'
----

. Commit the group `PolicyGenTemplate` CR in Git, and then push to the Git repository being monitored by the Argo CD application.
+
[NOTE]
====
Subsequent changes to the referenced `ConfigMap` CR are not automatically synced to the applied policies. You need to manually sync the new `ConfigMap` changes to update existing PolicyGenTemplate CRs. See "Syncing new ConfigMap changes to existing PolicyGenTemplate CRs".
