= DNS tracking
You can configure graphical representation of Domain Name System (DNS) tracking of network flows in the *Overview* view. Using DNS tracking with extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) tracepoint hooks can serve various purposes:

* Network Monitoring: Gain insights into DNS queries and responses, helping network administrators identify unusual patterns, potential bottlenecks, or performance issues.

* Security Analysis: Detect suspicious DNS activities, such as domain name generation algorithms (DGA) used by malware, or identify unauthorized DNS resolutions that might indicate a security breach.

* Troubleshooting: Debug DNS-related issues by tracing DNS resolution steps, tracking latency, and identifying misconfigurations.

When DNS tracking is enabled, you can see the following metrics represented in a chart in the *Overview*. See the _Additional Resources_ in this section for more information about enabling and working with this view.

* Top 5 average DNS latencies
* Top 5 DNS response code
* Top 5 DNS response code stacked with total

This feature is supported for IPv4 and IPv6 UDP protocol.
