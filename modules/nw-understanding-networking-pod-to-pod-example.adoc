= Example: Controlling pod-to-pod communication

In a microservices-based application with multiple pods, a frontend pod needs to communicate with the a backend pod to retrieve data. By using pod-to-pod communication, either directly or through services, these pods can efficiently exchange information.

To control and secure pod-to-pod communication, you can define network controls. These controls enforce security and compliance requirements by specifying how pods interact with each other based on labels and selectors.
