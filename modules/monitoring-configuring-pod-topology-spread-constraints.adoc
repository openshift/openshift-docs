= Configuring pod topology spread constraints

You can configure pod topology spread constraints for 
ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
all the pods deployed by the Cluster Monitoring Operator
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
all the pods for user-defined monitoring
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
to control how pod replicas are scheduled to nodes across zones.
This ensures that the pods are highly available and run more efficiently, because workloads are spread across nodes in different data centers or hierarchical infrastructure zones.

You can configure pod topology spread constraints for monitoring pods by using 
ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
the `cluster-monitoring-config` or 
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
the `user-workload-monitoring-config` config map.

.Prerequisites

ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* *If you are configuring pods for core {product-title} monitoring:*
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
** You have created the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* *If you are configuring pods for user-defined monitoring:*
** A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role, or as a user with the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.
* The `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object exists. This object is created by default when the cluster is created.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* *To configure pod topology spread constraints for core {product-title} monitoring:*

. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` config map in the `openshift-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

. Add the following settings under the `data/config.yaml` field to configure pod topology spread constraints:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>: # <1>
      topologySpreadConstraints:
      - maxSkew: <n> # <2>
        topologyKey: <key> # <3>
        whenUnsatisfiable: <value> # <4>
        labelSelector: # <5>
          <match_option>
----
<1> Specify a name of the component for which you want to set up pod topology spread constraints.
<2> Specify a numeric value for `maxSkew`, which defines the degree to which pods are allowed to be unevenly distributed.
<3> Specify a key of node labels for `topologyKey`.
Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
The scheduler tries to put a balanced number of pods into each domain.
<4> Specify a value for `whenUnsatisfiable`.
Available options are `DoNotSchedule` and `ScheduleAnyway`.
Specify `DoNotSchedule` if you want the `maxSkew` value to define the maximum difference allowed between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
Specify `ScheduleAnyway` if you want the scheduler to still schedule the pod but to give higher priority to nodes that might reduce the skew.
<5> Specify `labelSelector` to find matching pods. 
Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding topology domain.

.Example configuration for Prometheus

[WARNING]

When you save changes to the `cluster-monitoring-config` config map, the pods and other resources in the `openshift-monitoring` project might be redeployed.
The running monitoring processes in that project might also restart.
