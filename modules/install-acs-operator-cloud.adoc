= Installing the {product-title-short} Operator for {product-title-managed-short}

[role="_abstract"]
Using the OperatorHub provided with {ocp} is the easiest way to install the {product-title-short} Operator.

.Prerequisites
* You have access to an {ocp} cluster using an account with Operator installation permissions.
* You must be using {ocp} {ocp-supported-version} or later. For information about supported platforms and architecture, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7045053[{product-title} Support Matrix].

.Procedure
. In the web console, go to the *Operators* -> *OperatorHub* page.

. If {product-title} is not displayed, enter *Advanced Cluster Security* into the *Filter by keyword* box to find the {product-title} Operator.

. Select the *{product-title} Operator* to view the details page.

. Read the information about the Operator, and then click *Install*.

. On the *Install Operator* page:

** Keep the default value for *Installation mode* as *All namespaces on the cluster*.
** Select a specific namespace in which to install the Operator for the *Installed namespace* field. Install the {product-title} Operator in the *rhacs-operator* namespace.
** Select automatic or manual updates for *Update approval*.
+
If you select automatic updates, when a new version of the Operator is available, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator.
+
If you select manual updates, when a newer version of the Operator is available, OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must manually approve the update request to update the Operator to the latest version.
+
Red{nbsp}Hat recommends enabling automatic upgrades for Operator in {product-title-managed-short}. See the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7045053[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes Support Matrix] for more information.
. Click *Install*.

.Verification
* After the installation completes, go to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* to verify that the {product-title} Operator is listed with the status of *Succeeded*.
