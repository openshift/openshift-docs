=== Accessing a virtual machine instance via SSH

You can use SSH to access a virtual machine, but first you must expose port 
22 on the VM.

The `virtctl expose` command forwards a virtual machine instance port to a node 
port and creates a service for enabled access. The following example creates 
the `fedora-vm-ssh` service which forwards port 22 of the `fedora-vm` virtual 
machine to a port on the node:

.Prerequisites
* The virtual machine instance you want to access must be running.

.Procedure
. Run the following command to create the `fedora-vm-ssh` service: 
+
----
$ virtctl expose vm fedora-vm --port=20022 --target-port=22 --name=fedora-vm-ssh --type=NodePort 
----

. Check the service to find out which port the service acquired:
+
----
$ oc get svc
NAME            TYPE       CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)           AGE
fedora-vm-ssh   NodePort   127.0.0.1      <none>        20022:32551/TCP   6s
----

. Log into the virtual machine instance via SSH, using the `ipAddress` of the 
node and the port that you found in Step 2:
+
----
$ ssh username@<node IP> -p 32551
----
