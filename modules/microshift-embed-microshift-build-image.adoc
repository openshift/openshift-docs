= Build and use the rpm-ostree image for offline deployments

[role="_abstract"]
You can use image builder to create `rpm-ostree` system images with embedded {microshift-short} container images.

To embed container images, you must add the image references to your image builder blueprint. You can create the commit and ISO as needed for your use case.

Add the prerequisites listed here to the ones that are included in the procedures that follow.
