.Prerequisites

* Install the {product-title} CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

* Install the AMQ Interconnect Operator to its own `amq-interconnect` namespace. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/2021.q1/html/deploying_amq_interconnect_on_openshift/adding-operator-router-ocp[Installing the AMQ Interconnect Operator].

.Verification

. Verify that the AMQ Interconnect Operator is available and the required pods are running:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n amq-interconnect
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
