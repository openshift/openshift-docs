= Preparing the GitOps ZTP site configuration repository

Before you can use the ZTP GitOps pipeline, you need to prepare the Git repository to host the site configuration data.

.Prerequisites

* You have configured the hub cluster GitOps applications for generating the required installation and policy custom resources (CRs).

* You have deployed the managed clusters using zero touch provisioning (ZTP).

.Procedure

. Create a directory structure with separate paths for the `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs.

. Export the `argocd` directory from the `ztp-site-generate` container image using the following commands:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ podman pull registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ztp-site-generate-rhel8:v{product-version}
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir -p ./out
----
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ podman run --log-driver=none --rm registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ztp-site-generate-rhel8:v{product-version}.1 extract /home/ztp --tar | tar x -C ./out
----

. Check that the `out` directory contains the following subdirectories:
+
* `out/extra-manifest` contains the source CR files that `SiteConfig` uses to generate extra manifest `configMap`.
* `out/source-crs` contains the source CR files that `PolicyGenTemplate` uses to generate the {rh-rhacm-first} policies.
* `out/argocd/deployment` contains patches and YAML files to apply on the hub cluster for use in the next step of this procedure.
* `out/argocd/example` contains the examples for `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` files that represent the recommended configuration.

The directory structure under `out/argocd/example` serves as a reference for the structure and content of your Git repository. The example includes `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` reference CRs for single-node, three-node, and standard clusters. Remove references to cluster types that you are not using. The following example describes a set of CRs for a network of single-node clusters:

├── policygentemplates
│   ├── common-ranGen.yaml
│   ├── example-sno-site.yaml
│   ├── group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml
│   ├── group-du-sno-validator-ranGen.yaml
│   ├── kustomization.yaml
│   └── ns.yaml
└── siteconfig
    ├── example-sno.yaml
    ├── KlusterletAddonConfigOverride.yaml
    └── kustomization.yaml
----

Keep `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs in separate directories. Both the `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` directories must contain a `kustomization.yaml` file that explicitly includes the files in that directory.

This directory structure and the `kustomization.yaml` files must be committed and pushed to your Git repository. The initial push to Git should include the `kustomization.yaml` files. The `SiteConfig` (`example-sno.yaml`) and `PolicyGenTemplate` (`common-ranGen.yaml`, `group-du-sno*.yaml`, and `example-sno-site.yaml`) files can be omitted and pushed at a later time as required when deploying a site.

The `KlusterletAddonConfigOverride.yaml` file is only required if one or more `SiteConfig` CRs which make reference to it are committed and pushed to Git. See `example-sno.yaml` for an example of how this is used.
