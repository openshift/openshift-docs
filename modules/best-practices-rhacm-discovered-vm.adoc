= Best practices when defining an {rh-rhacm}-discovered VM

You can configure any VM in the cluster that is not an {rh-rhacm}-managed application as an {rh-rhacm}-discovered application. This includes VMs imported by using the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV), VMs created by using the {product-title} web console, or VMs created by any other means, such as the CLI.

You can take several actions to improve your experience and chance of success when defining an {rh-rhacm}-discovered VM.

Protecting the VM when using MTV, the {product-title} web console, or a custom VM:: Because automatic labeling is not currently available, the application owner must manually label the components of the VM application when using MTV, the {product-title} web console, or a custom VM.
+
After creating the VM, apply a common label to the following resources associated with the VM: `VirtualMachine`, `DataVolume`, `PersistentVolumeClaim`, `Service`, `Route`, `Secret` and `ConfigMap`. If the VM uses an instance type or preference, you must also label the `ControllerRevision` copy of these objects referenced by the spec or status of the VM. Do not label virtual machine instances (VMIs) or pods; {VirtProductName} creates and manages these automatically.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must apply the common label to everything in the namespace that you want to protect, including objects that you added to the VM that are not listed here.
====

Including more than the `VirtualMachine` object in the VM:: Working VMs typically also contain data volumes, persistent volume claims (PVCs), services, routes, secrets, `ConfigMap` objects, and `VirtualMachineSnapshot` objects.

Including the VM as part of a larger logical application:: This includes other pod-based workloads and VMs.
