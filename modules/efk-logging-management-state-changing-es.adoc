= Changing the Elasticsearch management state

In managed state, the Elasticsearch Operator (EO) responds to changes in the Elaticsearch Custom Resource (CR)
and attempts to update the Elasticsearch cluster to match the CR.  

In an unmanaged state, the EO does not respond to changes in the CR. 
The administrator assumes full control of individual component configurations 
and upgrades when in unmanaged state. If you make changes to a CR in managed state,
the Elasticsearch Operator can revert those changes. 

[NOTE]
====
An unmanaged Elasticsearch deployment does not receive updates until the Elasticsearch is placed back into a managed state.

.Prerequisite
