= Attributes Processor

[role="_abstract"]
The Attributes Processor can modify attributes of a span, log, or metric. You can configure this processor to filter and match input data and include or exclude such data for specific actions.

This processor operates on a list of actions, executing them in the order specified in the configuration. The following actions are supported:

Insert:: Inserts a new attribute into the input data when the specified key does not already exist.

Update:: Updates an attribute in the input data if the key already exists.

Upsert:: Combines the insert and update actions: Inserts a new attribute if the key does not exist yet. Updates the attribute if the key already exists.

Delete:: Removes an attribute from the input data.

Hash:: Hashes an existing attribute value as SHA1.

Extract:: Extracts values by using a regular expression rule from the input key to the target keys defined in the rule. If a target key already exists, it is overridden similarly to the Span Processor's `to_attributes` setting with the existing attribute as the source.

Convert:: Converts an existing attribute to a specified type.
