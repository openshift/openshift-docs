= Understanding the {product-title} control plane

The control plane, which is composed of master machines, manages the
{product-title} cluster. The control plane machines manage workloads on the
compute machines, which are also known as worker machines. The cluster itself manages all upgrades to the
machines by the actions of the Cluster Version Operator, the
Machine Config Operator, and set of individual Operators.
