= Resource quota for pipelines

A resource quota limits the total resource consumption per namespace. It can limit the quantity of objects created in a namespace, based on the type of the object. In addition, it can limit the total amount of compute resources consumed by resources in that namespace, using a compute resource quota.

Currently, Kubernetes does not provide any direct means of specifying compute resource quota for pipelines. You can implement a workaround for this limitation by using resource quota per priority class.

== Specifying pipelines resource quota using priority class

A priority class defines a mapping from a priority class name to the integer value of the priority, with higher value implying the higher the priority. After you create a priority class, you can create pods that specify the priority class name in their specifications. In addition, you can control a pod's consumption of system resources based on the pod's priority.

Specifying resource quota for a pipeline is approximately equivalent to setting resource quota for the subset of pods created by a pipeline run. The following steps provide an example of the workaround by specifying resource quota based on priority class.

. Create a priority class for a pipeline.

No pods are created at the moment, so no resources are used from the quota.
