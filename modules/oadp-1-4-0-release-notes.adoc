== Resolved issues

.Restore works correctly in {product-title} 4.16

Previously, while restoring the deleted application namespace, the restore operation partially failed with the `resource name may not be empty` error in {product-title} 4.16.
With this update, restore works as expected in {product-title} 4.16.
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-4075[OADP-4075]

.Data Mover backups work properly in the {product-title} 4.16 cluster

Previously, Velero was using the earlier version of SDK where the `Spec.SourceVolumeMode` field did not exist. As a consequence, Data Mover backups failed in the {product-title} 4.16 cluster on the external snapshotter with version 4.2.
With this update, external snapshotter is upgraded to version 7.0 and later. As a result, backups do not fail in the {product-title} 4.16 cluster.

== Known issues

.Backup fails when checksumAlgorithm is not set for MCG

While performing a backup of any application with Noobaa as the backup location, if the `checksumAlgorithm` configuration parameter is not set, backup fails. To fix this problem, if you do not provide a value for `checksumAlgorithm` in the Backup Storage Location (BSL) configuration, an empty value is added.
The empty value is only added for BSLs that are created using Data Protection Application (DPA) custom resource (CR), and this value is not added if BSLs are created using any other method.

[id="upgrade-notes-1-4-0_{context}"]
== Upgrade notes

[NOTE]
====
Always upgrade to the next minor version. *Do not* skip versions. To update to a later version, upgrade only one channel at a time. For example, to upgrade from {oadp-first} 1.1 to 1.3, upgrade first to 1.2, and then to 1.3.

=== Changes from OADP 1.3 to 1.4

The Velero server has been updated from version 1.12 to 1.14. Note that there are no changes in the Data Protection Application (DPA).

This changes the following:

* The `velero-plugin-for-csi` code is now available in the Velero code, which means an `init` container is no longer required for the plugin.

* Velero changed client Burst and QPS defaults from 30 and 20 to 100 and 100, respectively.

* The `velero-plugin-for-aws` plugin updated default value of the `spec.config.checksumAlgorithm` field in `BackupStorageLocation` objects (BSLs) from `""` (no checksum calculation) to the `CRC32` algorithm. The checksum algorithm types are known to work only with AWS.
Several S3 providers require the `md5sum` to be disabled by setting the checksum algorithm to `""`. Confirm `md5sum` algorithm support and configuration with your storage provider.
+
In OADP 1.4, the default value for BSLs created within DPA for this configuration is `""`. This default value means that the `md5sum` is not checked, which is consistent with OADP 1.3. For BSLs created within DPA, update it by using the `spec.backupLocations[].velero.config.checksumAlgorithm` field in the DPA. If your BSLs are created outside DPA, you can update this configuration by using `spec.config.checksumAlgorithm` in the BSLs.
