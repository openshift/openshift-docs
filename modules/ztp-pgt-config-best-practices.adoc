= Best practices when customizing PolicyGenTemplate CRs

Consider the following best practices when customizing site configuration `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs:

* Use as few policies as necessary. Using fewer policies means using less resources. Each additional policy creates overhead for the hub cluster and the deployed spoke cluster. CRs are combined into policies based on the `policyName` field in the `PolicyGenTemplate` CR. CRs in the same `PolicyGenTemplate` which have the same value for `policyName` are managed under a single policy.

* Use a single catalog source for all Operators. In disconnected environments, configure the registry as a single index containing all Operators. Each additional `CatalogSource` on the spoke clusters increases CPU usage.

* `MachineConfig` CRs should be included as `extraManifests` in the `SiteConfig` CR so that they are applied during installation. This can reduce the overall time taken until the cluster is ready to deploy applications.

* `PolicyGenTemplates` should override the channel field to explicitly identify the desired version. This ensures that changes in the source CR during upgrades does not update the generated subscription.
