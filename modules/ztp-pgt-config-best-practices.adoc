= Best practice when configuring PolicyGenTemplate CRs

The following best practices should be followed when customizing `PolicyGenTemplate` content for your site configuration.

* Use as few policies as necessary. Using fewer policies means using less resources. Each additional policy creates overhead for the hub cluster and the deployed spoke cluster.
* Use a single catalog source for all operators. When operating in a disconnected environment, the registry can be set up with multiple operator indexes or a single index containing all operators. Each additional `CatalogSource` on the spoke clusters increases CPU usage.
* `MachineConfig` CRs should be included as `extraManifests` in the `SiteConfig` CR so that they are applied during installation. This can reduce the overall time taken until the cluster is ready to deploy applications.
* `PolicyGenTemplates` should override the channel field to explicitly identify the desired version. This ensures that changes in the source CR during upgrades does not update the subscription.
