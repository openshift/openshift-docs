= Recommendations when customizing {policy-gen-cr} CRs

Consider the following best practices when customizing site configuration `{policy-gen-cr}` custom resources (CRs):

* Use as few policies as are necessary. Using fewer policies requires less resources. Each additional policy creates increased CPU load for the hub cluster and the deployed managed cluster. CRs are combined into policies based on the `policyName` field in the `{policy-gen-cr}` CR. CRs in the same `{policy-gen-cr}` which have the same value for `policyName` are managed under a single policy.

* In disconnected environments, use a single catalog source for all Operators by configuring the registry as a single index containing all Operators. Each additional `CatalogSource` CR on the managed clusters increases CPU usage.

* `MachineConfig` CRs should be included as `extraManifests` in the `SiteConfig` CR so that they are applied during installation. This can reduce the overall time taken until the cluster is ready to deploy applications.

* `{policy-gen-cr}` CRs should override the channel field to explicitly identify the desired version. This ensures that changes in the source CR during upgrades does not update the generated subscription.
