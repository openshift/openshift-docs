= Creating new alerting rules

As a cluster administrator, you can create new alerting rules based on platform metrics.
These alerting rules trigger alerts based on the values of chosen metrics.

[NOTE]
====
* If you create a customized `AlertingRule` resource based on an existing platform alerting rule, silence the original alert to avoid receiving conflicting alerts.

* To help users understand the impact and cause of the alert, ensure that your alerting rule contains an alert message and severity value.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user that has the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Create a new YAML configuration file named `example-alerting-rule.yaml`.

. Add an `AlertingRule` resource to the YAML file.
The following example creates a new alerting rule named `example`, similar to the default `Watchdog` alert:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.openshift.io/v1
kind: AlertingRule
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: openshift-monitoring # <1>
spec:
  groups:
  - name: example-rules
    rules:
    - alert: ExampleAlert # <2>
      for: 1m # <3>
      expr: vector(1) # <4>
      labels:
        severity: warning # <5>
      annotations:
        message: This is an example alert. # <6>
----
<1> Ensure that the namespace is `openshift-monitoring`.
<2> The name of the alerting rule you want to create.
<3> The duration for which the condition should be true before an alert is fired.
<4> The PromQL query expression that defines the new rule.
<5> The severity that alerting rule assigns to the alert.
<6> The message associated with the alert.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must create the `AlertingRule` object in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace. Otherwise, the alerting rule is not accepted.
====

. Apply the configuration file to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f example-alerting-rule.yaml
