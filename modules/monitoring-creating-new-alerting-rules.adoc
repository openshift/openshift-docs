= Creating new alerting rules

As a cluster administrator, you can create new alerting rules based on platform metrics.
These alerting rules trigger alerts based on the values of chosen metrics.

[NOTE]
====
If you create a customized `AlertingRule` resource based on an existing platform alerting rule, silence the original alert to avoid receiving conflicting alerts.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user that has the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Create a new YAML configuration file named `example-alerting-rule.yaml` in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace.

. Add an `AlertingRule` resource to the YAML file.
The following example creates a new alerting rule named `example`, similar to the default `watchdog` alert:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.openshift.io/v1
kind: AlertingRule
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
spec:
  groups:
  - name: example-rules
    rules:
    - alert: ExampleAlert <1>
      expr: vector(1) <2>
----
<1> The name of the alerting rule you want to create.
<2> The PromQL query expression that defines the new rule.

. Apply the configuration file to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f example-alerting-rule.yaml
----
