= Creating new alerting rules

[role="_abstract"]
As a cluster administrator, you can create new alerting rules based on platform metrics.
These alerting rules trigger alerts based on the values of chosen metrics.

[NOTE]
====
* If you create a customized `AlertingRule` resource based on an existing platform alerting rule, silence the original alert to avoid receiving conflicting alerts.

* To help users understand the impact and cause of the alert, ensure that your alerting rule contains an alert message and severity value.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user that has the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
* You have installed the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Create a new YAML configuration file named `example-alerting-rule.yaml`.

. Add an `AlertingRule` resource to the YAML file.
The following example creates a new alerting rule named `example`, similar to the default `Watchdog` alert:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.openshift.io/v1
kind: AlertingRule
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
spec:
  groups:
  - name: example-rules
    rules:
    - alert: ExampleAlert
      for: 1m
      expr: vector(1)
      labels:
        severity: warning
      annotations:
        message: This is an example alert.
----
+
--
where:

`namespace`::
Specifies the project. Ensure that the namespace is `openshift-monitoring`.

`alert`::
Specifies the name of the alerting rule you want to create.

`for`::
Specifies the duration for which the condition should be true before an alert is fired.

`expr`::
Specifies the PromQL query expression that defines the new rule.

`labels.severity`::
Specifies the severity that alerting rule assigns to the alert.

`annotations.message`::
Specifies the message associated with the alert.
--
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must create the `AlertingRule` object in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace. Otherwise, the alerting rule is not accepted.
====

. Apply the configuration file to the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f example-alerting-rule.yaml
