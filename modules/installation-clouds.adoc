= {product-title} clusters on Installer Provisioned Infrastructure

[IMPORTANT]
====
In version {product-version}, you can install {product-title} on only Amazon
Web Services (AWS).
====

You can install either a standard cluster or a customized cluster. With a
standard cluster, you provide minimum details that you need to install the
cluster. With a customized cluster, you can specify more details about the
platform, such as the number of machines that the control plane uses, the type
of virtual machine that the cluster deploys, or the CIDR range for the
Kubernetes service network.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is possible to modify Kubernetes and the Ignition Configs that control
the underlying {op-system-first} operating system during installation. However,
no validation is available to confirm the suitability of any modifications that
you make to these objects. If you modify these objects, you might render
your cluster non-functional. Because of this risk, modifying Kubernetes and
Ignition Configs is not supported.
====

When you install {product-title} cluster with Installer Provisioned Infrastructure (IPI), you download the
installer from link:https://cloud.openshift.com/clusters/install[the OpenShift start page]. This site manages:

* REST API for accounts
* Registry tokens, which are the pull secrets that you use to obtain the required
components
* Cluster registration, which associates the cluster identity to your Red Hat
account to facilitate the gathering of usage metrics

In {product-title} 4, the installation program is a Go binary that performs a
series of file transformations on a set of assets. When you use Installer
Provisioned Infrastructure,
you delegate the infrastructure bootstrapping and provisioning to the installation program
instead of doing it yourself. Because you do not use the installation program  to upgrade or
update your cluster, if you do not highly customize your cluster, you run the
installer only once.

You use three sets of files during installation: an installation configuration
file, Kubernetes manifests, and Ingition configurations for your machine types.

The installation configuration file is transformed into Kubernetes manifests, and
then the manifests are wrapped into Ignition configurations. The installation program  uses
these Ingition configurations to create the cluster.

The install configuration files are all pruned when you run the installation program ,
so be sure to back up all configuration files that you want to use again.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot modify the parameters that you set during installation, but you can
modify many cluster attributes after installation.

////
There are individual commands to perform the different actions in cluster creation
if you want to try to make customizations, but you can run openshift-install
create cluster to get the default cluster done quick.

$ openshift-install --help
$ openshift-install create install-config
$ openshift-install create manifests
$ openshift-install create ignition-configs
$ openshift-install create cluster
