= Disabling copied CSVs

When an Operator is installed by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), a simplified copy of its cluster service version (CSV) is created in every namespace that the Operator is configured to watch. These CSVs are known as _copied CSVs_ and communicate to users which controllers are actively reconciling resource events in a given namespace.

When Operators are configured to use the `AllNamespaces` install mode, versus targeting a single or specified set of namespaces, a copied CSV is created in every namespace on the cluster. On especially large clusters, with namespaces and installed Operators potentially in the hundreds or thousands, copied CSVs consume an untenable amount of resources, such as OLM's memory usage, cluster etcd limits, and networking.

To support these larger clusters, cluster administrators can disable copied CSVs for Operators installed with the `AllNamespaces` mode.

[WARNING]
====
If you disable copied CSVs, a user's ability to discover Operators in the OperatorHub and CLI is limited to Operators installed directly in the user's namespace.

If an Operator is configured to reconcile events in the user's namespace but is installed in a different namespace, the user cannot view the Operator in the OperatorHub or CLI. Operators affected by this limitation are still available and continue to reconcile events in the user's namespace.

This behavior occurs for the following reasons:
* Copied CSVs identify the Operators available for a given namespace.
* Role-based access control (RBAC) scopes the user's ability to view and discover Operators in the OperatorHub and CLI.
====

.Procedure

* Edit the `OLMConfig` object named `cluster` and set the `spec.features.disableCopiedCSVs` field to `true`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OLMConfig
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  features:
    disableCopiedCSVs: true <1>
EOF
----
<1> Disabled copied CSVs for `AllNamespaces` install mode Operators

.Verification

* When copied CSVs are disabled, OLM captures this information in an event in the Operator's namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get events
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
LAST SEEN   TYPE      REASON               OBJECT                                MESSAGE
85s         Warning   DisabledCopiedCSVs   clusterserviceversion/my-csv.v1.0.0   CSV copying disabled for operators/my-csv.v1.0.0
----
+
When the `spec.features.disableCopiedCSVs` field is missing or set to `false`, OLM recreates the copied CSVs for all Operators installed with the `AllNamespaces` mode and deletes the previously mentioned events.
