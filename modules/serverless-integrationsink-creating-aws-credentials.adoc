= Creating AWS credentials

Several `IntegrationSink` API resources require access to Amazon Web Services (AWS) services such as S3, SNS, and SQS. To connect securely, you must create a Kubernetes Secret containing valid AWS credentials in the namespace where the `IntegrationSink` API resource will be created.

The Secret must include an AWS access key ID and secret access key with sufficient permissions to access the target AWS service. This Secret will then be referenced in each `IntegrationSink` configuration.

.Prerequisites

* You have an AWS account with an access key ID and secret access key that provide access to the relevant service.
* You have the OpenShift CLI (oc) installed and are logged in to the cluster.
* You have identified the namespace in which the `IntegrationSink` resource will be created.

.Procedure

* Create the secret by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n <namespace> create secret generic my-secret \
  --from-literal=aws.accessKey=<accessKey> \
  --from-literal=aws.secretKey=<secretKey>
----
+
Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace where the `IntegrationSink` resource will be created, and substitute `<accessKey>` and `<secretKey>` with the appropriate AWS credentials.
