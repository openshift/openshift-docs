= Release notes for {builds-shortname} 1.7

[role="_abstract"]
{builds-shortname} 1.7 is now available on {ocp-product-title} 4.16-4.21.

[NOTE]
====
With this release, you can use a new migration tool, Crane. It automatically converts the `BuildConfig` resources to `Build` resources, which simplifies adopting the {builds-title} application. To learn more about this tool and its benefits, see link:https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2026/01/27/migrate-buildconfig-resources-builds-red-hat-openshift-crane[Migrate BuildConfig resources to Builds for Red Hat OpenShift with Crane].

== New features

The following sections highlight what is new in {builds-shortname} 1.7.

Read-only root file systems enforced for containers::
With this update, you must set the `readOnlyRootFilesystem` parameter to `true` for your containers in {ocp-product-title}. This change addresses security audits and protects containers from potential vulnerabilities.

Operator pod containers now use read-only root file systems::
With this update, the root filesystems of the Operator container and the shared resource container are set to read-only. This enhancement improves security by preventing runtime modifications to internal container files. The update also includes an end-to-end (E2E) test to validate the workflow.

[id="fixed-issues-1-7_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

Buffer overflow in error logging resolved::
Before this update, non-standard input caused a buffer overflow in error logging, which led to user data loss. With this update, database connection settings resolve intermittent connection errors. As a result, error logging functions correctly and prevents data loss.

Missing ClusterRoleBinding in OpenShift Builds Operator resolved::
Before this update, the `ClusterRole` Operator was incorrectly referenced in `openshift-builds-operator` `ClusterRoleBinding`, which caused permission errors. With this update, the `openshift-builds-operator` `ClusterRoleBinding` reference is correctly updated to `openshift-builds-operator` `Clusterrole`.

CSI driver correctly enforces RBAC permissions for Secrets and ConfigMaps::
Before this update, the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver error handling logic ignored forbidden errors when attempting to fetch source `Secret` or `ConfigMap` resources. Consequently, the driver mounted an empty volume instead of failing the mount operation, which bypassed intended role-based access control (RBAC) security. With this update, the CSI driver correctly returns errors from the API client to the caller. This fix ensures that the driver requires an explicit `RoleBinding` namespace to access resources.
