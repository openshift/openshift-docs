== New features

The following sections highlight what is new in {builds-shortname} 1.7.

Read-only root filesystems enforced for containers::
With this update, you must set the `readOnlyRootFilesystem` parameter to `true` in {ocp-product-title} for your containers. This change addresses security audits and protects containers against potential vulnerabilities.

Operator pod containers now use read-only root file systems::
With this update, the root filesystems of the operator container and the shared resource container are set to read-only. This enhancement improves security by preventing runtime modifications to internal container files. The update also includes an end-to-end (E2E) test to validate the workflow.

[id="fixed-issues-1-7_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

Buffer overflow in error logging resolved::
Before this update, non-standard input caused a buffer overflow in error logging, which led to user data loss. With this update, database connection settings are updated to resolve intermittent connection errors and ensure error logging functions correctly and prevent data loss.

Missing ClusterRoleBinding in OpenShift Builds operator resolved::
Before this update, the ClusterRole `operator` was incorrectly referenced in `openshift-builds-operator` ClusterRoleBinding causing permission errors. With this update, the `openshift-builds-operator` ClusterRoleBinding reference is correctly updated to `openshift-builds-operator` Clusterrole.

CSI driver correctly enforces RBAC permissions for Secrets and ConfigMaps::
Before this update, the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver error handling logic ignored ‘Forbidden’ errors when attempting to fetch source Secrets or ConfigMaps. Consequently, the driver mounted an empty volume instead of failing the mount operation, which bypassed intended role-based access control (RBAC) security. With this update, the CSI driver correctly returns errors from the API client to the caller. This fix ensures that the driver requires an explicit namespaced `RoleBinding` to access resources.
