= Enforcement on existing deployments

For existing deployments, policy changes only result in enforcement at the next detection of the criteria, when a Kubernetes event occurs. If you make changes to a policy, you must reassess policies by selecting *Policy Management* and clicking *Reassess All*. This action applies deploy policies on all existing deployments regardless of whether there are any new incoming Kubernetes events. If a policy is violated, then {product-title-short} performs enforcement.
