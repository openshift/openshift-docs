= Deploying a serverless application

To deploy a serverless application, you must apply the `service.yaml` file.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the directory where the `service.yaml` file is contained.
. Deploy the application by applying the `service.yaml` file.
+
----
$ oc apply --filename service.yaml
----

Now that service has been created and the application has been deployed, Knative will create a new immutable revision for this version of the application.

Knative will also perform network programming to create a route, ingress, service, and load balancer for your application, and will automatically scale your pods up and down based on traffic, including inactive pods.
