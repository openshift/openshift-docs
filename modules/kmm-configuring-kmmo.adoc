= Configuring the Kernel Module Management Operator

In most cases, the default configuration for the Kernel Module Management (KMM) Operator does not need to be modified. However, you can modify the Operator settings to suit your environment using the following procedure.

The Operator configuration is set in the `kmm-operator-manager-config` `ConfigMap` in the Operator namespace.

.Procedure

. To modify the settings, edit the `ConfigMap` data by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit configmap -n "$namespace" kmm-operator-manager-config
----
+
.Example output
+
[source,yaml]

|===
|Parameter |Description

| `healthProbeBindAddress`
| Defines the address on which the Operator monitors for kubelet health probes. The recommended value is `:8081`.

|`leaderElection.enabled`
|Determines whether leader election is used to ensure that only one replica of the KMM Operator is running at any time. For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/leases/[Leases]. The recommended value is `true`.

|`leaderElection.resourceID`
|Determines the name of the resource that leader election uses for holding the leader lock. The recommended value is `kmm.sigs.x-k8s.io`.

|`webhook.disableHTTP2`
|If `true`, disables HTTP/2 for the webhook server, as a mitigation for link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-44487[cve-2023-44487]. The recommended value is `true`.

|`webhook.port`
|Defines the port on which the Operator monitors webhook requests. The recommended value is `9443`.

|`metrics.enableAuthnAuthz`
a|Determines if metrics are authenticated using `TokenReviews` and authorized using `SubjectAccessReviews` with the kube-apiserver.

For authentication and authorization, the controller needs a `ClusterRole` with the following rules:

* `apiGroups: authentication.k8s.io, resources: tokenreviews, verbs: create`

* `apiGroups: authorization.k8s.io, resources: subjectaccessreviews, verbs: create`

To scrape metrics, for example, using Prometheus, the client needs a `ClusterRole` with the following rule:

* `nonResourceURLs: "/metrics", verbs: get`

The recommended value is `true`.

|`metrics.disableHTTP2`
|If `true`, disables HTTP/2 for the metrics server as a mitigation for https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-44487[CVE-2023-44487]. The recommended value is `true`.

|`metrics.bindAddress`
|Determines the bind address for the metrics server. If unspecified, the default is `:8080`. To disable the metrics server, set to `0`. The recommended value is `0.0.0.0:8443`.

|`metrics.secureServing`
|Determines whether the metrics are served over HTTPS instead of HTTP. The recommended value is `true`.

|`worker.runAsUser`
|Determines the value of the `runAsUser` field of the worker container's security context. For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/[SecurityContext]. The recommended value is `9443`.

|`worker.seLinuxType`
|Determines the value of the `seLinuxOptions.type` field of the worker container's security context. For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/[SecurityContext]. The recommended value is `spc_t`.

|`worker.setFirmwareClassPath`
|Sets the kernel's firmware search path into the `/sys/module/firmware_class/parameters/path` file on the node. The recommended value is `/var/lib/firmware` if you need to set that value through the worker app. Otherwise, unset.
|===

. After modifying the settings, restart the controller with the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete pod -n "<namespace>" -l app.kubernetes.io/component=kmm

The value of <namespace> depends on your original installation method.
