[id="kmm-configuring-kmmo_{context}"]
= Configuring the Kernel Module Management Operator

In most cases, the default configuration for the Kernel Module Management (KMM) Operator does not need to be modified. However, you can modify the Operator settings to suit your environment.

.Procedure

* To modify any setting, create a `ConfigMap` with the name `kmm-operator-manager-config` in the Operator namespace with the relevant data and restart the controller using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rollout restart -n "$namespace" deployment/kmm-operator-controller
----
+
The value of `$namespace` depends on your installation method.
+
.Example output
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  controller_config.yaml: |
    worker:
      firmwareHostPath: /example/different/firmware/path
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kmm-operator-manager-config
  namespace: openshift-kmm
----

[NOTE]
====
If you want to configure `KMM Hub`, create the `ConfigMap` using the name `kmm-operator-hub-manager-config` in the KMM Hub controller's namespace.

.Operator configuration parameters
[cols="2,8",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

| `healthProbeBindAddress`
| Defines the address on which the Operator monitors for kubelet health probes. The recommended value is `:8081`.

|`job.gcDelay`
|Defines the duration for which successful build pods should be preserved before they are deleted. For information about the valid values for this setting, see link:https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration[ParseDuration]. The default value is `0s`.

|`leaderElection.enabled`
|Determines whether leader election is used to ensure that only one replica of the KMM Operator is running at any time. For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/leases/[Leases]. The default value is `true`.

|`leaderElection.resourceID`
|Determines the name of the resource that leader election uses for holding the leader lock. The default value for KMM is `kmm.sigs.x-k8s.io`. The default value for KMM-hub is `kmm-hub.sigs.x-k8s.io`.

|`metrics.bindAddress`
|Determines the bind address for the metrics server. Set this to "0" to disable the metrics server. The default value is `0.0.0.0:8443`.

|`metrics.disableHTTP2`
|If `true`, disables HTTP/2 for the metrics server as a mitigation for https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-44487[CVE-2023-44487]. The default value is `true`.

|`metrics.enableAuthnAuthz`
a|Determines if metrics are authenticated using `TokenReviews` and authorized using `SubjectAccessReviews` with the kube-apiserver.

For authentication and authorization, the controller needs a `ClusterRole` with the following rules:

* `apiGroups: authentication.k8s.io, resources: tokenreviews, verbs: create`

* `apiGroups: authorization.k8s.io, resources: subjectaccessreviews, verbs: create`

To scrape metrics, for example, using Prometheus, the client needs a `ClusterRole` with the following rule:

* `nonResourceURLs: "/metrics", verbs: get`

The default value is `true`.

|`metrics.secureServing`
|Determines whether the metrics are served over HTTPS instead of HTTP. The default value is `true`.

|`webhook.disableHTTP2`
|If `true`, disables HTTP/2 for the webhook server, as a mitigation for link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-44487[CVE-2023-44487]. The default value is `true`.

|`webhook.port`
|Defines the port on which the Operator monitors webhook requests. The default value is `9443`.

|`worker.runAsUser`
|Determines the value of the `runAsUser` field of the worker container's security context. For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/[SecurityContext]. The default value is `9443`.

|`worker.seLinuxType`
|Determines the value of the `seLinuxOptions.type` field of the worker container's security context. For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/[SecurityContext]. The default value is `spc_t`.

|`worker.firmwareHostPath`
|If set, the value of this field is written by the worker container into the /sys/module/firmware_class/parameters/path file on the node. For more information see link:https://openshift-kmm.netlify.app/documentation/firmwares/#setting-the-kernels-firmware-search-path[Setting the kernel's firmware search path]. The default value is `/var/lib/firmware`.
