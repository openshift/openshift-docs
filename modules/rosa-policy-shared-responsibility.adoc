= Shared responsibility matrix


The customer, Red Hat, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) share responsibility for the monitoring and maintenance of an {product-title} cluster. This documentation illustrates the delineation of responsibilities by area and task.

[id="rosa-policy-incident-operations-management_{context}"]
== Incident and operations management
The customer is responsible for incident and operations management of customer application data and any custom networking the customer may have configured for the cluster network or virtual network.

|Resource
|Red Hat and AWS responsibilities
|Customer responsibilities

|Application networking
|Monitor cloud load balancers and native OpenShift router service, and respond to alerts.
|- Monitor health of service load balancer endpoints.
- Monitor health of application routes, and the endpoints behind them.
- Report outages to Red Hat.

|Virtual networking
|Monitor cloud load balancers, subnets, and public cloud components necessary for default platform networking, and respond to alerts.
|Monitor network traffic that is optionally configured through VPC to VPC connection, VPN connection, or Direct connection for potential issues or security threats.

[id="rosa-policy-change-management_{context}"]
== Change management
Red Hat is responsible for enabling changes to the cluster infrastructure and services that the customer will control, as well as maintaining versions for the master nodes, infrastructure nodes and services, and worker nodes. The customer is responsible for initiating infrastructure change requests and installing and maintaining optional services and networking configurations on the cluster, as well as all changes to customer data and customer applications.

|Logging
|- Centrally aggregate and monitor platform audit logs.
- Provide and maintain a logging Operator to enable the customer to deploy a logging stack for default application logging.
- Provide audit logs upon customer request.
|- Install the optional default application logging Operator on the cluster.
- Install, configure, and maintain any optional app logging solutions, such as logging sidecar containers or third-party logging applications.
- Tune size and frequency of application logs being produced by customer applications if they are affecting the stability of the logging stack or the cluster.
- Request platform audit logs through a support case for researching specific incidents.

|Application networking
|- Set up public cloud load balancers. Provide the ability to set up private load balancers and up to one additional load balancer when required.
- Set up native OpenShift router service. Provide the ability to set the router as private and add up to one additional router shard.
- Install, configure, and maintain OpenShift SDN components for default internal pod traffic.
- Provide the ability for the customer to manage `NetworkPolicy` and `EgressNetworkPolicy` (firewall) objects.
|- Configure non-default pod network permissions for project and pod networks, pod ingress, and pod egress using `NetworkPolicy` objects.
- Use OpenShift Cluster Manager (OCM) to request a private load balancer for default application routes.
- Use OCM to configure up to one additional public or private router shard and corresponding load balancer.
- Request and configure any additional service load balancers for specific services.
- Configure any necessary DNS forwarding rules.

|Cluster networking
|- Set up cluster management components, such as public or private service endpoints and necessary integration with virtual networking components.
- Set up internal networking components required for internal cluster communication between worker, infrastructure, and master nodes.
|- Provide optional non-default IP address ranges for machine CIDR, service CIDR, and pod CIDR if needed through OCM when the cluster is provisioned.
- Request that the API service endpoint be made public or private on cluster creation or after cluster creation through OCM.

|Virtual networking
|- Set up and configure virtual networking components required to provision the cluster, including virtual private cloud, subnets, load balancers, Internet gateways, NAT gateways, etc.
- Provide the ability for the customer to manage VPN connectivity with on-premises resources, VPC to VPC connectivity, and Direct connectivity as required through OCM.
- Enable customers to create and deploy public cloud load balancers for use with service load balancers.
|- Set up and maintain optional public cloud networking components, such as VPC to VPC connection, VPN connection, or Direct connection.
- Request and configure any additional service load balancers for specific services.

|Cluster version
|- Communicate schedule and status of upgrades for minor and maintenance versions.
- Publish change logs and release notes for minor and maintenance upgrades.
|- Work with Red Hat to establish maintenance start times for upgrades.
- Test customer applications on minor and maintenance versions to ensure compatibility.

|Capacity management
|- Monitor the use of control plane. Control planes are master nodes and infrastructure nodes.
- Scale and resize control plane nodes to maintain quality of service.
- Monitor the use of customer resources including network, storage and compute capacity. Where autoscaling features are not enabled alert customer for any changes required to cluster resources, such as new compute nodes to scale and additional storage.
|- Use the provided OCM controls to add or remove additional worker nodes as required.
- Respond to Red Hat notifications regarding cluster resource requirements.
