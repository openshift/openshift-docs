= Configuring authentication credentials for OpenAPI services

To invoke OpenAPI service operations secured by authentication schemes, you must configure the corresponding credentials and parameters in your application. {ServerlessLogicProductName} uses these configurations to authenticate with the external services during workflow execution.

This procedure describes how to define and apply the necessary configuration properties for security schemes declared in the OpenAPI specification file. You can use either `application.properties`, the `ConfigMap` associated to your workflow, or environment variables to provide these credentials.

[NOTE]
====
The security schemes defined in an OpenAPI specification file are global to all the operations that are available in the same file. This means that the configurations set for a particular security scheme also apply to the other secured operations.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have access to a {ServerlessLogicProductName} project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {ocp-product-title}.
* Your OpenAPI specification is defined in one or more security schemes.
* You have access to the OpenAPI specification files.
* You have identified the schemes you want to configure `http-basic-example` or `api-key-example`.
* You have access to the application properties file, the workflow `ConfigMap`, or environment variable setup.

.Procedure

. Use the following format to compose your property keys:
+
[source,text]
----
quarkus.openapi-generator.[filename].auth.[security_scheme_name].[auth_property_name]
----
+
* `filename` is the sanitized name of the file containing the OpenAPI specification, such as security_example_json.
* `security_scheme_name` is the sanitized name of the security scheme object definition in the OpenAPI specification file, such as http_basic_example or api_key_example.
* `auth_property_name` is the name of the property to configure, such as username. This property depends on the defined security scheme type.

. Apply MicroProfile environment variable mapping rules and replace any non-alphabetic characters with underscores `_` as shown in the following example:
+
[source,text]
----
export QUARKUS_OPENAPI_GENERATOR_SECURITY_EXAMPLE_JSON_AUTH_HTTP_BASIC_EXAMPLE_USERNAME=myuser
export QUARKUS_OPENAPI_GENERATOR_SECURITY_EXAMPLE_JSON_AUTH_HTTP_BASIC_EXAMPLE_PASSWORD=mypassword
----

. Set the credentials by adding the configuration to your `application.properties`, workflow `ConfigMap` as follows: 
+
[source,text]
----
quarkus.openapi-generator.security_example_json.auth.http_basic_example.username=myuser
quarkus.openapi-generator.security_example_json.auth.http_basic_example.password=mypassword
----
