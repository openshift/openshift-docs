[id="rosa-customer-requirements_{context}"]
= Customer Requirements

{product-title} (ROSA) clusters must meet several prerequisites before they can be deployed.
[NOTE]
====
In order to create the cluster, the user must be logged in as an IAM user and not an assumed role or STS user.
====

[id="rosa-account_{context}"]
== Account
* The customer ensures that the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html[AWS limits] are sufficient to support {product-title} provisioned within the customer's AWS account.
* The customer's AWS account should be in the customer’s AWS Organizations with the applicable service control policy (SCP) applied.
+
[NOTE]
====
It is not a requirement that the customer's account be within the AWS Organizations or for the SCP to be applied, however Red Hat must be able to perform all the actions listed in the SCP without restriction.
====

* The customer's AWS account should not be transferable to Red Hat.
* The customer may not impose AWS usage restrictions on Red Hat activities. Imposing restrictions will severely hinder Red Hat’s ability to respond to incidents.
* The customer may deploy native AWS services within the same AWS account.
+
[NOTE]
====
Customers are encouraged, but not mandated, to deploy resources in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) separate from the VPC hosting {product-title} and other Red Hat supported services.
====

[id="rosa-access-requirements_{context}"]
== Access requirements
* To appropriately manage the {product-title} service, Red Hat must have the `AdministratorAccess` policy applied to the administrator role at all times. This requirement does *not* apply if you are using AWS Security Token Service (STS).
+
[NOTE]
====
This policy only provides Red Hat with permissions and capabilities to change resources in the customer-provided AWS account.
====
* Red Hat must have AWS console access to the customer-provided AWS account. This access is protected and managed by Red Hat.
* The customer must not utilize the AWS account to elevate their permissions within the {product-title} cluster.
* Actions available in the {product-title} (ROSA) CLI, `rosa`, or {cluster-manager-url} console must not be directly performed in the customer's AWS account.

[id="rosa-support-requirements_{context}"]
== Support requirements
* Red Hat recommends that the customer have at least link:https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/[Business Support] from AWS.
* Red Hat has authority from the customer to request AWS support on their behalf.
* Red Hat has authority from the customer to request AWS resource limit increases on the customer's account.
* Red Hat manages the restrictions, limitations, expectations, and defaults for all {product-title} clusters in the same manner, unless otherwise specified in this requirements section.

[id="rosa-security-requirements_{context}"]
== Security requirements
* Volume snapshots will remain within the customer's AWS account and customer-specified region.
* Red Hat must have ingress access to EC2 hosts and the API server from allow-listed IP addresses.
* Red Hat must have egress allowed to forward system and audit logs to a Red Hat managed central logging stack.
