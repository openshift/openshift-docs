= Installing {microshift-short} from an RPM package

Use the following procedure to install {microshift-short} from an RPM package.

.Prerequisites

* The system requirements for installing {microshift-short} have been met.
* You completed the steps of preparing to install {microshift-short} from an RPM package.

.Procedure

. For all lifecycles, enable the repository for your release by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ sudo subscription-manager repos \
    --enable rhocp-<4.18>-for-<9>-$(uname -m)-rpms \ # <1>
    --enable fast-datapath-for-<9>-$(uname -m)-rpms # <2>
----
<1> Replace _<4.18>_ and _<9>_ with the compatible versions of your {microshift-short} and {op-system-base-full}.
<2> Replace  _<9>_ with the compatible version of {op-system-base}.

. For extended support (EUS) releases, also enable the EUS repositories by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
`$ sudo subscription-manager repos \
    --enable rhel-<9>-for-x86_64-appstream-eus-rpms \ # <1>
    --enable rhel-<9>-for-x86_64-baseos-eus-rpms` # <2>
----
<1> Replace _<9>_ with the compatible major version number of {op-system-base}.
<2> Replace _<9>_ with the compatible major version number of {op-system-base}.

. Avoid unintended future updates into an unsupported configuration by locking your operating system version with the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo subscription-manager release --set=<9.4> command. # <1>
----
<1> Replace _<9.4>_ with the major and minor version of your compatible {op-system-base} system.

. Install {microshift-short} by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo dnf install -y microshift
----

. Download your installation pull secret from the https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console] to a temporary folder, for example, `$HOME/openshift-pull-secret`. This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the container registries that serve the container images used by {product-title}.

. To copy the pull secret to the `/etc/crio` folder of your {op-system-base} machine, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo cp $HOME/openshift-pull-secret /etc/crio/openshift-pull-secret
----

. Make the root user the owner of the `/etc/crio/openshift-pull-secret` file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo chown root:root /etc/crio/openshift-pull-secret
----

. Make the `/etc/crio/openshift-pull-secret` file readable and writeable by the root user only by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo chmod 600 /etc/crio/openshift-pull-secret
----

. If your {op-system-base} machine has a firewall enabled, you must configure a few mandatory firewall rules. For `firewalld`, run the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=trusted --add-source=10.42.0.0/16
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=trusted --add-source=169.254.169.1
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
----

If the Volume Group (VG) that you have prepared for {microshift-short} used the default name `rhel`, no further configuration is necessary. If you have used a different name, or if you want to change more configuration settings, see the Configuring {microshift-short} section.
