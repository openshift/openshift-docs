= Examining the pod

{product-title} leverages the Kubernetes concept of a pod, which is one or more containers deployed together on one host, and the smallest compute unit that can be defined, deployed, and managed.
Pods are the rough equivalent of a machine instance, physical or virtual, to a container.

The *Overview* panel enables you to access many features of the `parksmap` deployment. The *Details* and *Resources* tabs enable you to scale application pods, check build status, services, and routes.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console.
* You are in the *Developer* perspective.
* You have a deployed image.

.Procedure

* Click `D parksmap` in the *Topology* view to open the *Overview* panel.
