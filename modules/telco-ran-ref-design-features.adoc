//CNF-7365
|{ztp} independence from managed cluster version
a|You can now use {ztp} to manage clusters that are running different versions of {product-title} compared to the version that is running on the hub cluster. You can also have a mix of {product-title} versions in the deployed fleet of clusters.

//CNF-6318, OCPVE-630
|Using OpenShift capabilities to further reduce the {sno} DU footprint
a|Use cluster capabilities to enable or disable optional components before you install the cluster.
In {product-title} {product-version}, the following optional capabilities are available:
`image-registry`, `baremetal`, `marketplace`, `openshift-samples`, `Console`, `Insights`, `Storage`, `CSISnapshot`, `NodeTuning`, `MachineAPI`. The reference configuration includes only those features required for RAN DU.
