= Enabling extended support repositories for image building

If you have an extended support (EUS) release of {microshift-short} or {op-system-base-full}, you must enable the {op-system-base} EUS repositories for image builder to use. If you do not have an EUS version, you can skip these steps.

.Prerequisites

* You have an EUS version of {microshift-short} or {op-system-base} or are updating to one.
* You have root-user access to your build host.
* You reviewed the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_build_of_microshift/{ocp-version}/html/getting_ready_to_install_microshift/microshift-install-get-ready#get-ready-install-rhde-compatibility-table_microshift-install-get-ready[{op-system-bundle} release compatibility matrix].

.Procedure

. Create the `/etc/osbuild-composer/repositories` directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/osbuild-composer/repositories
----

. Copy the `/usr/share/osbuild-composer/repositories/rhel-9.4.json` file into the `/etc/osbuild-composer/repositories` directory by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo cp /usr/share/osbuild-composer/repositories/rhel-9.4.json /etc/osbuild-composer/repositories/rhel-9.4.json
----

. Update the `baseos` source by modifying the `/etc/osbuild-composer/repositories/rhel-9.4.json` file with the following values:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# ...
"baseurl": "https://cdn.redhat.com/content/eus/rhel<9>/<9.4>//baseos/os", # <1>
# ...
----
<1> Replace _<9>_ with the major {op-system-base} version you are using, and replace _<9.4>_ with the _<major.minor>_ version. Be certain that the {op-system-base} version you choose is compatible with the {microshift-short} version you are using.

. Optional. Apply the `baseos` update by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo sed -i "s,dist/rhel<9>/<9.4>/$(uname -m)/baseos/,eus/rhel<9>/<9.4>/$(uname -m)/baseos/,g" \
/etc/osbuild-composer/repositories/rhel-<9.4>.json # <1>
----
<1> Replace _<9>_ with the major {op-system-base} version you are using, and replace _<9.4>_ with the _<major.minor>_ version. Be certain that the {op-system-base} version you choose is compatible with the {microshift-short} version you are using.

. Update the `appstream` source by modifying the `/etc/osbuild-composer/repositories/rhel-<major.minor>.json` file with the following values:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# ...
"baseurl": "https://cdn.redhat.com/content/eus/rhel<9>/<9.4>//appstream/os", # <1>
# ...
----
<1> Replace _<9>_ with the major {op-system-base} version you are using, and replace _<9.4>_ with the _<major.minor>_ version. Be certain that the {op-system-base} version you choose is compatible with the {microshift-short} version you are using.

. Optional. Apply the `appstream` update by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo sed -i "s,dist/rhel<9>/<9.4>/$(uname -m)/appstream/,eus/rhel<9>/<9.4>/$(uname -m)/appstream/,g" \
/etc/osbuild-composer/repositories/rhel-<9.4>.json # <1>
----
<1> Replace _<9>_ with the major {op-system-base} version you are using, and replace _<9.4>_ with the _<major.minor>_ version. Be certain that the {op-system-base} version you choose is compatible with the {microshift-short} version you are using.

.Verification

You can verify the repositories by using the `composer-cli` tool to display information about the source.

. Verify the `baseos` source by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo composer-cli sources info baseos | grep 'url ='
----
.Example output
+
[source,text]
----
url = "https://cdn.redhat.com/content/eus/rhel9/9.4/x86_64/baseos/os"
----

. Verify the `appstream` source by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo composer-cli sources info appstream | grep 'url ='
----
.Example output
+
[source,text]
----
url = "https://cdn.redhat.com/content/eus/rhel9/9.4/x86_64/appstream/os"
