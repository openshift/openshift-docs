= Running a pipeline

With the default configuration, `kam` bootstraps an OpenShift Pipelines pipeline for building code when a Pull Request is opened.

. To make the pipeline run automatically on push to your repositories, create a webhook for your Git hosting service:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ kam webhook create \
    --git-host-access-token <git host access token> \
    --env-name dev \
    --service-name taxi
----
[NOTE]
====
If the webhook creation fails because the `gitops-webhook-event-listener-route` route is absent, log in to the Argo CD UI to verify if the applications have been created and synced successfully. 
====

. Make the changes to your application code and create a Pull Request.

. In the OpenShift web console, navigate to *Pipelines* and see a new _PipelineRun_.

. Click the _PipelineRun_  name and see the details.

. Navigate to the *Logs* tab see the logs which report that the build completed and the image was pushed successfully.
