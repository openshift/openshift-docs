= Understanding VirtIO drivers

VirtIO drivers are paravirtualized device drivers required for Microsoft Windows
 virtual machines to run in {VirtProductName}. The supported drivers are
available in the `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk of the
link:https://access.redhat.com/containers/#/registry.access.redhat.com/container-native-virtualization/virtio-win[Red Hat Container Catalog].

The `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk must be attached to the virtual machine as a
SATA CD drive to enable driver installation. You can install VirtIO drivers during
Windows installation on the virtual machine or added to an
existing Windows installation.

After the drivers are installed, the `container-native-virtualization/virtio-win` container disk can be removed
from the virtual machine.
