= NIC partitioning for SR-IOV devices (Technology Preview)

{product-title} can be deployed on a server with a dual port network interface card (NIC).
You can partition a single, high-speed dual port NIC into multiple virtual functions (VFs) and enable SR-IOV.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, it is not possible to assign virtual functions (VF) for system services such as OVN-Kubernetes and assign other VFs created from the same physical function (PF) to pods connected to the SR-IOV Network Operator.
====

This feature supports the use of bonds for high availability with the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP).

[NOTE]
====
Only one LACP can be declared by physical NIC.
====

An {product-title} cluster can be deployed on a bond interface with 2 VFs on 2 physical functions (PFs) using the following methods:

* Agent-based installer
+
[NOTE]
====
The minimum required version of `nmstate` is:

* `1.4.2-4` for RHEL 8 versions
* `2.2.7` for RHEL 9 versions
====

* Installer-provisioned infrastructure installation
* User-provisioned infrastructure installation
