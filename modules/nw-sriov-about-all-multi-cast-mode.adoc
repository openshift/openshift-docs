= About all-multicast mode

Enabling all-multicast mode, particularly in the context of rootless applications, is critical. If you do not enable this mode, you would be required to grant the `NET_ADMIN` capability to the pod's Security Context Constraints (SCC). If you were to allow the `NET_ADMIN` capability to grant the pod privileges to make changes that extend beyond its specific requirements, you could potentially expose security vulnerabilities.

The tuning CNI plugin supports changing several interface attributes, including all-multicast mode. By enabling this mode, you can allow applications running on Virtual Functions (VFs) that are configured on a SR-IOV network device to receive multicast traffic from applications on other VFs, whether attached to the same or different physical functions.
