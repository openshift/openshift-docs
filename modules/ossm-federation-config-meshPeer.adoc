= Joining a federated mesh

You declare the federation between two meshes by creating a `ServiceMeshPeer` resource. The `ServiceMeshPeer` resource defines the federation between two meshes, and you use it to configure discovery for the peer mesh, access to the peer mesh, and certificates used to validate the other mesh’s clients.

image::ossm-federated-mesh.png[Service Mesh federated mesh peers illustration]

Meshes are federated on a one-to-one basis, so each pair of peers requires a pair of `ServiceMeshPeer` resources specifying the federation connection to the other service mesh. For example, federating two meshes named `red` and `green` would require two `ServiceMeshPeer` files.

. On red-mesh-system, create a `ServiceMeshPeer` for the green mesh.
. On green-mesh-system, create a `ServiceMeshPeer` for the red mesh.

Federating three meshes named `red`, `blue`, and `green` would require six `ServiceMeshPeer` files.

. On red-mesh-system, create a `ServiceMeshPeer` for the green mesh.
. On red-mesh-system, create a `ServiceMeshPeer` for the blue mesh.
. On green-mesh-system, create a `ServiceMeshPeer` for the red mesh.
. On green-mesh-system, create a `ServiceMeshPeer` for the blue mesh.
. On blue-mesh-system, create a `ServiceMeshPeer` for the red mesh.
. On blue-mesh-system, create a `ServiceMeshPeer` for the green mesh.

//TODO Insert ServiceMeshPeer diagram here

Configuration in the `ServiceMeshPeer` resource includes the following:

* The address of the other mesh’s ingress gateway, which is used for discovery and service requests.
* The names of the local ingress and egress gateways that is used for interactions with the specified peer mesh.
* The client ID used by the other mesh when sending requests to this mesh.
* The trust domain used by the other mesh.
* The name of a `ConfigMap` containing a root certificate that is used to validate client certificates in the trust domain used by the other mesh.

In the following example, the administrator for the `red-mesh` is configuring federation with the `green-mesh`.
