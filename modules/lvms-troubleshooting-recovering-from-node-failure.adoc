[id="recovering-from-node-failure_{context}"]
= Recovering from node failure

Sometimes a persistent volume claim (PVC) is stuck in a `Pending` state because a particular node in the cluster has failed. To identify the failed node, you can examine the restart count of the `topolvm-node` pod. An increased restart count indicates potential problems with the underlying node, which may require further investigation and troubleshooting.

.Procedure

* Examine the restart count of the `topolvm-node` pod instances by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-storage

After you resolve any issues with the node, you might need to perform the forced cleanup procedure if the PVC is still stuck in a `Pending` state.
