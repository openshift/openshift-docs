[id="recovering-from-node-failure_{context}"]
= Recovering from node failure

A persistent volume claim (PVC) can be stuck in the `Pending` state due to a node failure in the cluster. 

To identify the failed node, you can examine the restart count of the `topolvm-node` pod. An increased restart count indicates potential problems with the underlying node, which might require further investigation and troubleshooting.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oc-first}.
* You have logged in to the {oc-first} as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.

.Procedure

* Examine the restart count of the `topolvm-node` pod instances by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-storage
----
+
.Example output

.Next steps

* If the PVC is stuck in the `Pending` state even after you have resolved any issues with the node, you must perform a forced clean-up. For more information, see "Performing a forced clean-up".
