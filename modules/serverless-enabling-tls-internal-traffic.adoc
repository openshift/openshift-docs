[id="serverless-enabling-tls-internal-traffic_{context}"]
= Enabling TLS authentication for internal traffic

{ServerlessProductName} supports TLS edge termination by default, so that HTTPS traffic from end users is encrypted. However, internal traffic behind the OpenShift route is forwarded to applications by using plain data. By enabling TLS for internal traffic, the traffic sent between components is encrypted, which makes this traffic more secure.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to enable internal TLS with a {SMProductName} integration, you must enable {SMProductShortName} with mTLS instead of the internal encryption explained in the following procedure.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving.
* You have installed the OpenShift (`oc`) CLI.

.Procedure

. Create or update your `KnativeServing` resource and make sure that it includes the `system-internal-tls: Enabled` field in the spec:
+
[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
  config:
    network:
      system-internal-tls: Enabled
...
----

. Restart the activator pods in the `knative-serving` namespace to load the certificates:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete pod -n knative-serving --selector app=activator
----

. Optionally, change the `defaultCertificate` in the Ingress Controller:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
 ...
spec:
  defaultCertificate:
    name: ca-ingress-cert
----

. If you changed the `defaultCertificate`, you need to specify the custom certificate name in the `openshift-ingress-default-certificate` field in the `KnativeServing` custom resource. For example, if the custom certificate name is `ca-ingress-cert`, add the following configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
  config:
    network:
      system-internal-tls: Enabled
      openshift-ingress-default-certificate: "ca-ingress-cert"
...
----
