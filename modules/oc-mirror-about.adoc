= Features of the oc-mirror plugin v1

The oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (`oc`) plugin is a single tool that mirrors all required {product-title} content and other images to your mirror registry. 

The oc-mirror plugin v1 provides the following features:

* Provides a centralized method to mirror {product-title} releases, Operators, helm charts, and other images.

* Maintains update paths for {product-title} and Operators.

* Uses a declarative image set configuration file in YAML, so that you can include only the {product-title} releases, Operators, and images that your cluster needs. Limiting what you mirror reduces the amount of data to download and transfer.

* Performs incremental mirroring, which reduces the size of future image sets.

* Prunes images from the target mirror registry that were excluded from the image set configuration since the previous execution.

* Optionally generates supporting artifacts for OpenShift Update Service (OSUS) usage.

The oc-mirror plugin v1 can also mirror arbitrary helm charts and additional container images to assist users in seamlessly synchronizing their workloads onto mirror registries.

The first time that you run the oc-mirror plugin v1, it populates your mirror registry with the necessary content for your disconnected cluster installation or update. To continue receiving updates, you must keep your mirror registry updated. Running the oc-mirror plugin v1 with the same configuration as the initial run ensures that you can do the following:

* Referencing metadata from the storage backend
* Download only the release since the last run
* Provide update paths for {product-title} and Operators
* Perform necessary dependency resolution

.High level workflow

The following steps outline the high-level workflow on how to use the oc-mirror plugin v1 to mirror images to a mirror registry:

. Create an image set configuration file.

. Mirror the image set to the target mirror registry by using one of the following methods:

** Mirror an image set directly to the target mirror registry.

** Mirror an image set to disk, transfer the image set to the target environment, then upload the image set to the target mirror registry.

. Configure your cluster to use the resources generated by the oc-mirror plugin v1.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you use the oc-mirror CLI plugin to populate a mirror registry, you must use the oc-mirror plugin v1 to make any further updates to the target mirror registry.
