= Removing a cluster from AWS

You can remove a cluster that you installed on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

.Procedure

. Optionally, from the computer that you used to install the cluster, run the
following command and record the UUID that it outputs:
+
----
$ oc get clusterversion -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterID}{"\n"}' version
----
+
If not all of the cluster resources are removed from AWS, you can use this UUID
to locate them and remove them.

. From the computer that you used to install the cluster, run the following command:
+
----
$ ./openshift-install destroy cluster \
--dir=<installation_directory> --log-level=debug <1>
----
<1> `installation_directory` is the directory you stored the {product-title}
definition files that the installation program creates.

. Optionally, delete the `installation_directory` directory.
