= Limiting access to a quick start

Not all quick starts should be available for everyone. The `accessReviewResources` section of the YAML file provides the ability to limit access to the quick start.

To only allow the user to access the quick start if they have the ability to create `HelmChartRepository` resources, use the following configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
accessReviewResources:
  - group: helm.openshift.io
    resource: helmchartrepositories
    verb: create
----

To only allow the user to access the quick start if they have the ability to list Operator groups and package manifests, thus ability to install Operators, use the following configuration:


[source,yaml]
----
accessReviewResources:
  - group: operators.coreos.com
    resource: operatorgroups
    verb: list
  - group: packages.operators.coreos.com
    resource: packagemanifests
    verb: list
----
