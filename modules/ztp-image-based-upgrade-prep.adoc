= Moving to the Prep stage of the image-based upgrade with {lcao} and {ztp}

When you deploy the {lcao} on a cluster, an `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR is automatically created. You update this CR to specify the image repository of the seed image and to move through the different stages.

[source,yaml]

apiVersion: lca.openshift.io/v1
kind: ImageBasedUpgrade

  name: upgrade

----

.Prerequisites

* Create policies and `ConfigMap` objects for resources used in the image-based upgrade. For more information, see "Creating ConfigMap objects for the image-based upgrade with {ztp}.

.Procedure

. Add policies for the `Prep`, `Upgrade`, and `Idle` stages to your existing group `PolicyGenTemplate` called `ibu-upgrade-ranGen.yaml`:

<1> The policy evaluation interval for compliant and non-compliant policies. Set them to `10s` to ensure that the policies status accurately reflects the current upgrade status.
<2> Define the seed image, {product-title} version, and pull secret for the upgrade in the Prep stage.
<3> Define the {oadp-short} `ConfigMap` resources required for backup and restore.

. Verify that the policies required for an image-based upgrade are created by running the following command:

$ oc get policies -n spoke1 | grep -E "example-group-ibu"

. Update the `du-profile` cluster label to the target platform version or the corresponding policy-binding label in the `SiteConfig` CR.

----
apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v1
kind: SiteConfig
[...]
spec:
  [...]
    clusterLabels:
      du-profile: "4.15.0"
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Updating the labels to the target platform version unbinds the existing set of policies.
====
--

. Commit and push the updated `SiteConfig` CR to the Git repository.

. When you are ready to move to the `Prep` stage, create the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` CR on the target hub cluster with the `Prep` and {oadp-short} `ConfigMap` policies:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterGroupUpgrade
metadata:
  name: cgu-ibu-prep
  namespace: default
spec:
  clusters:
  - spoke1
  enable: true
  managedPolicies:
  - example-group-ibu-oadp-cm-policy
  - example-group-ibu-prep-stage-policy
  remediationStrategy:
    canaries:
      - spoke1
    maxConcurrency: 1
    timeout: 240
----

. Apply the `Prep` policy by running the following command:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f cgu-ibu-prep.yml
----

If you provide `ConfigMap` objects for {oadp-short} resources and extra manifests, {lcao} validates the specified `ConfigMap` objects during the `Prep` stage.
You might encounter the following issues: 

* Validation warnings or errors if the {lcao} detects any issues with `extraManifests` 
* Validation errors if the {lcao} detects any issues with `oadpContent`

Validation warnings do not block the `Upgrade` stage but you must decide if it is safe to proceed with the upgrade.
These warnings, for example missing CRDs, namespaces or dry run failures, update the `status.conditions` in the `Prep` stage and `annotation` fields in the `ImageBasedUpgrade` CR with details about the warning.

.Example validation warning
[source,yaml]
----
[...]
metadata:
annotations:
  extra-manifest.lca.openshift.io/validation-warning: '...'
[...]
----

However, validation errors, such as adding `MachineConfig` or Operator manifests to extra manifests, cause the `Prep` stage to fail and block the `Upgrade` stage.

When the validations pass, the cluster creates a new `ostree` stateroot, which involves pulling and unpacking the seed image, and running host level commands.
Finally, all the required images are precached on the target cluster.

. Monitor the status and wait for the `cgu-ibu-prep` `ClusterGroupUpgrade` to report `Completed` by running the following command:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get cgu -n default
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                    AGE   STATE       DETAILS
