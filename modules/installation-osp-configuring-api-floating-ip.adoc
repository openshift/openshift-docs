= Configuring application access with floating IP addresses

After you install {product-title}, configure {rh-openstack-first} to allow application network traffic.

[NOTE]
====
You do not need to perform this procedure if you provided values for `platform.openstack.lbFloatingIP` and `platform.openstack.ingressFloatingIP` in the `install-config.yaml` file, or `os_api_fip` and `os_ingress_fip` in the `inventory.yaml` playbook, during installation. The floating IP addresses are already set.
====

.Prerequisites

* {product-title} cluster must be installed
* Floating IP addresses are enabled as described in the {product-title} on {rh-openstack} installation documentation.

.Procedure

After you install the {product-title} cluster, attach a floating IP address to the ingress port:

. Show the port:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openstack port show <cluster_name>-<cluster_ID>-ingress-port
----

. Attach the port to the IP address:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openstack floating ip set --port <ingress_port_ID> <apps_FIP>
----

. Add a wildcard `A` record for `*apps.` to your DNS file:
+
[source,dns]
----
*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>  IN  A  <apps_FIP>
----

[NOTE]
====
If you do not control the DNS server but want to enable application access for non-production purposes, you can add these hostnames to `/etc/hosts`:

[source,dns]
----
<apps_FIP> console-openshift-console.apps.<cluster name>.<base domain>
<apps_FIP> integrated-oauth-server-openshift-authentication.apps.<cluster name>.<base domain>
<apps_FIP> oauth-openshift.apps.<cluster name>.<base domain>
<apps_FIP> prometheus-k8s-openshift-monitoring.apps.<cluster name>.<base domain>
<apps_FIP> grafana-openshift-monitoring.apps.<cluster name>.<base domain>
<apps_FIP> <app name>.apps.<cluster name>.<base domain>
