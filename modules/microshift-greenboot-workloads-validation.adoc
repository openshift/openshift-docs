[id="microshift-greenboot-workloads-validation_{context}"]
= Checking the results of an update

After a successful start, greenboot sets the variable `boot_success=` to `1` in GRUB. You can view the overall status of system health checks after an update in the system log by using the following procedure.

.Procedure

* To access the overall status of system health checks, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo grub2-editenv - list | grep ^boot_success
----
+
.Example output for a successful system start
[source,terminal]
----
boot_success=1 <1>
----
<1> If your command returns `boot_success=0`, either the greenboot health check is still running, or the update is a failure.
