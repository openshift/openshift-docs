= {pac} resolver annotations

[role="_abstract"]
You can use {pac} resolver annotations to reference `Task` and `Pipeline` custom resource (CR) definitions. If you reference a remote task in a pipeline run, or a pipeline in a `PipelineRun` or a `PipelineSpec` object, the {pac} resolver automatically resolves the referenced resource includes it in the resulting `PipelineRun` custom resource (CR. If there is any error while fetching the remote tasks or parsing them, {pac} stops processing the tasks.
