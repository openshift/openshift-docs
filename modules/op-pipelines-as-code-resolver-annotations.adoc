= {pac} resolver annotations

[role="_abstract"]
You can use {pac} resolver annotations to reference `Task` and `Pipeline` custom resource (CR) definitions. The {pac} resolver fetches the definitions from the locations that you specify in the annotations. If there is any error while fetching the remote tasks or parsing them, {pac} stops processing the tasks.

If you reference a remote task in a pipeline run, or a pipeline in a `PipelineRun` or a `PipelineSpec` object, the {pac} resolver automatically resolves the referenced resource and includes it in the resulting `PipelineRun` custom resource (CR).

====
The public instance of Tekton Hub (`hub.tekton.dev`) is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use link:https://artifacthub.io[Artifact Hub] as an alternative for Tekton `Pipeline` and `Task` resources:

* link:https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?repo=tekton-catalog-tasks[Tekton Catalog Tasks]  
* link:https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?repo=tekton-catalog-pipelines[Tekton Catalog Pipelines]

Artifact Hub is open source and supports self-hosting, providing greater flexibility for managing your Tekton `Pipeline` and `Task` resources.
