[id="provision-oci-infrastructure-ocp-cluster_{context}"]
= Provisioning {oci} infrastructure for your cluster - 1

By using the {ai-full} to create details for your {product-title} cluster, you can specify these details in a stack. A stack is an {oci} feature where you can automate the provisioning of all necessary {oci} infrastructure resources, such as the custom image, that are required for installing an {product-title} cluster on {oci}.

The {oci-first} Compute Service creates a virtual machine (VM) instance on {oci}. This instance can then automatically attach to a virtual network interface controller (vNIC) in the virtual cloud network (VCN) subnet. On specifying the IP address of your {product-title} cluster in the custom manifest template files, the {oci} instance can communicate with your cluster over the VCN.

.Prerequisites

* You downloaded the discovery ISO image to a local directory. For more information, see "Using the {ai-full} to generate an {oci}-compatible discovery ISO image".

.Procedure

. Log in to your link:https://cloud.oracle.com/a/[{oci-first-no-rt}] account.

. Upload the discovery ISO image from your local drive to the new object storage bucket you created. For details, see link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/managingobjects_topic-To_upload_objects_to_a_bucket.htm[Uploading an Object Storage Object to a Bucket]. 

. Create a Pre-Authenticated Request for the ISO image in *Object Storage*. For details, see link:https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingpreauthenticatedrequests.htm[Pre-Authenticated Requests for Object Storage]. The URL is used for the OpenShift Image Source URI in the next step.

. Create the terraform stack:

.. Upload the terraform stack template to the new object storage bucket.

.. Complete the stack information and click *Next*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Make sure that *Cluster Name* matches *Cluster Name* in {ai-full}, and *Zone DNS* matches *Base Domain* in {ai-full}. 
* In the *openshift_image_source_uri* field, paste the Pre-Authenticated Request URL link that you generated in the previous step.

. Open the stack and select *Outputs*. Copy the `dynamic_custom_manifest` key and contents. For details, see TBD.
