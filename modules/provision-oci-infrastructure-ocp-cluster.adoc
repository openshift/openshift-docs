[id="provision-oci-infrastructure-ocp-cluster_{context}"]
= Provisioning {oci} infrastructure for your cluster

When using the {ai-full} to create details for your {product-title} cluster, you specify these details in a Terraform stack. A stack is an {oci} feature that automates the provisioning of all necessary {oci} infrastructure resources that are required for installing an {product-title} cluster on {oci}.

.Prerequisites

* You downloaded the discovery ISO image to a local directory. For details, see "Using the {ai-full} to generate an {oci}-compatible discovery ISO image".
* You downloaded the Terraform stack template to a local directory. For details, see "Preparing the {oci} environment".

.Procedure

. Log in to your link:https://cloud.oracle.com/a/[{oci-first-no-rt}] account.

. Upload the discovery ISO image from your local drive to the new object storage bucket you created. For the full procedure, see link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/managingobjects_topic-To_upload_objects_to_a_bucket.htm[Uploading an Object Storage Object to a Bucket (Oracle documentation)]. 

. Locate the uploaded discovery ISO, and complete the following steps:
+
--
.. Create a Pre-Authenticated Request (PAR) for the ISO from the adjacent options menu.

.. Copy the generated URL to use as the OpenShift Image Source URI in the next step. 
--
+
For the full procedure, see link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingpreauthenticatedrequests_topic-To_create_a_preauthenticated_request_for_all_objects_in_a_bucket.htm[Creating a Pre-Authenticated Requests in Object Storage (Oracle documentation)]. 

. Create and apply the Terraform stack:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The Terraform stack includes files for creating cluster resources and custom manifests. The stack also includes a script, and when you apply the stack, the script creates {oci} resources, such as DNS records, an instance, and so on. For a list of the resources, see link:https://github.com/oracle-openshift/oci-openshift/blob/main/terraform-stacks/README.md[Terraform Defined Resources for OpenShift on {oci} README file].
====
+
--
.. Upload the Terraform stack template link:https://github.com/oracle-openshift/oci-openshift/releases/tag/main[create-cluster-vX.X.X.zip] to the new object storage bucket.

.. Complete the stack information and click *Next*. 
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
* Make sure that *Cluster Name* matches *Cluster Name* in {ai-full}, and *Zone DNS* matches *Base Domain* in {ai-full}. 
* In the *OpenShift Image Source URI* field, paste the Pre-Authenticated Request URL link that you generated in the previous step. 
* Ensure that the correct *Compute Shape* field value is defined, depending on whether you are installing on bare metal or a virtual machine. If not, select a different shape from the list. For details, see link:docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/computeshapes.htm[Compute Shapes (Oracle documentation)]. 
====

.. Click *Apply* to apply the stack.

For the full procedure, see link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/openshift-on-oci/installing-assisted.htm#install-cluster-apply-stack[Creating {product-title} Infrastructure Using Resource Manager (Oracle documentation)]. 

. Copy the `dynamic_custom_manifest.yml` file from the *Outputs* page of the Terraform stack. 
+
[NOTE]
====
The YAML file contains all the required manifests, concatenated and preformatted with the configuration values. For details, see the link:https://github.com/oracle-openshift/oci-openshift/blob/main/custom_manifests/README.md[Custom Manifests README file].
