[id="openshift-logging-release-notes-6-1-0-enhancements"]
== New Features and Enhancements

=== Log Collection

* This enhancement adds the source `iostream` to the attributes sent from collected container logs. The value is set to either `stdout` or `stderr` based on how the collector received it. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-5292[LOG-5292])

* With this update, the default memory limit for the collector increases from 1024 Mi to 2048 Mi. Users should adjust resource limits based on their clusterâ€™s specific needs and specifications. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6072[LOG-6072])

* With this update, users can now set the syslog output delivery mode of the `ClusterLogForwarder` CR to either `AtLeastOnce` or `AtMostOnce.` (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6355[LOG-6355])

=== Log Storage

* With this update, the new `1x.pico` LokiStack size supports clusters with fewer workloads and lower log volumes (up to 50GB/day). (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-5939[LOG-5939])

== Technology Preview

:FeatureName: The OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) output log forwarder
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

* With this update, OpenTelemetry logs can now be forwarded using the `OTel` (OpenTelemetry) data model to a Red Hat Managed LokiStack instance. To enable this feature, add the `observability.openshift.io/tech-preview-otlp-output: "enabled"` annotation to your `ClusterLogForwarder` configuration. For additional configuration information, see link:https://github.com/openshift/cluster-logging-operator/blob/master/docs/features/logforwarding/outputs/opentelemetry-lokistack-forwarding.adoc[OTLP Forwarding].

* With this update, a `dataModel` field has been added to the `lokiStack` output specification. Set the `dataModel` to `Otel` to configure log forwarding using the OpenTelemetry data format. The default is set to `Viaq`. For information about data mapping see link:https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/[OTLP Specification].
