= About iptables rules synchronization

The synchronization period determines how frequently the Kubernetes network
proxy (kube-proxy) syncs the iptables rules on a node.

A sync begins when either of the following events occurs:

* An event occurs, such as service or endpoint is added to or removed from the
cluster.
* The time since the last sync exceeds the sync period defined for kube-proxy.
