= Prerequisites for deploying {hcp} on non-bare metal agent machines

You must review the following prerequisites before deploying {hcp} on non-bare metal agent machines:

* You need the {mce} 2.5 and later installed on an {product-title} cluster. The {mce-short} is automatically installed when you install {rh-rhacm-first}. You can also install the {mce-short} without {rh-rhacm} as an Operator from the {product-title} OperatorHub.

* You have at least one managed {product-title} cluster for the {mce-short}. The `local-cluster` managed hub cluster is automatically imported. See link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.11/html/clusters/cluster_mce_overview#advanced-config-engine[Advanced configuration] for more information about the local-cluster. You can check the status of your hub cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get managedclusters local-cluster
----

* You enabled central infrastructure management. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.11/html/clusters/cluster_mce_overview#enable-cim[Enabling the central infrastructure management service].

* You installed the `hcp` command-line interface.

* Your hosted cluster has a cluster-wide unique name. A hosted cluster name cannot be the same as any existing managed cluster in order for the {mce-short} to manage it.

* You run the hub cluster and workers on the same platform for {hcp}.
