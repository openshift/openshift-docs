= Prerequisites for deploying {hcp} on non-bare-metal agent machines

Before you deploy {hcp} on non-bare-metal agent machines, ensure you meet the following prerequisites:

* You must have {mce} 2.5 or later installed on an {product-title} cluster. You can install the {mce-short} as an Operator from the {product-title} OperatorHub.

* You must have at least one managed {product-title} cluster for the {mce-short}. The `local-cluster` management cluster is automatically imported. For more information about the `local-cluster`, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.12/html/clusters/cluster_mce_overview#advanced-config-engine[Advanced configuration] in the {rh-rhacm-title} documentation. You can check the status of your management cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get managedclusters local-cluster
----

* You have enabled central infrastructure management. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.12/html/clusters/cluster_mce_overview#enable-cim[Enabling the central infrastructure management service] in the {rh-rhacm-title} documentation.

* You have installed the `hcp` command-line interface.

* Your hosted cluster has a cluster-wide unique name.

* You are running the management cluster and workers on the same infrastructure.
