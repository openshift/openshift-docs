= Managing policy from the web console

[role="_abstract"]
You can update the node network configuration, such as adding or removing interfaces from nodes, by applying `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` manifests to the cluster.

Manage the policy from the web console by accessing the list of created policies in the *NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy* page under the *Networking* menu. This page enables you to create, update, monitor, and delete the policies.
