= Required CRDs

Relying on other required CRDs is completely optional and only exists to reduce
the scope of individual Operators and provide a way to compose multiple
Operators together to solve an end-to-end use case.

An example of this is an Operator that might set up an application and install
an etcd cluster (from an etcd Operator) to use for distributed locking and a
Postgres database (from a Postgres Operator) for data storage.

The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) checks against the available CRDs and
Operators in the cluster to fulfill these requirements. If suitable versions are
found, the Operators are started within the desired namespace and a Service
Account created for each Operator to create, watch, and modify the Kubernetes
resources required.
