|Metric name |Description
|`kepler_container_joules_total` |The aggregated package or socket energy consumption of CPU, DRAM, and other host components by a container.

|`kepler_container_core_joules_total` |The total energy consumption across CPU cores used by a container. If the system has access to `RAPL_` metrics, this metric reflects the proportional container energy consumption of the RAPL Power Plan 0 (PP0), which is the energy consumed by all CPU cores in the socket.

|`kepler_container_dram_joules_total` |The total energy consumption of DRAM by a container.

|`kepler_container_uncore_joules_total` |The cumulative energy consumption by uncore components used by a container. The number of components might vary depending on the system. The uncore metric is processor model-specific and might not be available on some server CPUs.

|`kepler_container_package_joules_total` |The cumulative energy consumed by the CPU socket used by a container. It includes all core and uncore components.

|`kepler_container_other_joules_total` |The cumulative energy consumption of host components, excluding CPU and DRAM, used by a container.
Generally, this metric is the energy consumption of ACPI hosts.

|`kepler_container_bpf_cpu_time_us_total` |The total CPU time used by the container that utilizes the BPF tracing.

|`kepler_container_cpu_cycles_total` |The total CPU cycles used by the container that utilizes hardware counters. CPU cycles is a metric directly related to CPU frequency. On systems where processors run at a fixed frequency, CPU cycles and total CPU time are roughly equivalent. On systems where processors run at varying frequencies, CPU cycles and total CPU time have different values.

|`kepler_container_cpu_instructions_total` |The total CPU instructions used by the container that utilizes hardware counters. CPU instructions is a metric that accounts how the CPU is used.

|`kepler_container_cache_miss_total` |The total cache miss that occurs for a container that uses hardware counters.

|`kepler_container_cgroupfs_cpu_usage_us_total` |The total CPU time used by a container reading from control group statistics.

|`kepler_container_cgroupfs_memory_usage_bytes_total` |The total memory in bytes used by a container reading from control group statistics.

|`kepler_container_cgroupfs_system_cpu_usage_us_total` |The total CPU time in kernel space used by the container reading from control group statistics.

|`kepler_container_cgroupfs_user_cpu_usage_us_total` |The total CPU time in user space used by a container reading from control group statistics.

|`kepler_container_bpf_net_tx_irq_total` |The total number of packets transmitted to network cards of a container that uses the BPF tracing.

|`kepler_container_bpf_net_rx_irq_total` |The total number of packets received from network cards of a container that uses the BPF tracing.

|`kepler_container_bpf_block_irq_total` |The total number of block I/O calls of a container that uses the BPF tracing.

|`kepler_node_info` |The node metadata, such as the node CPU architecture.

|`kepler_node_core_joules_total` |The total energy consumption across CPU cores used by all containers running on a node and operating system.

|`kepler_node_uncore_joules_total` |The cumulative energy consumption by uncore components used by all containers running on the node and operating system. The number of components might vary depending on the system.

|`kepler_node_dram_joules_total` |The total energy consumption of DRAM by all containers running on the node and operating system.

|`kepler_node_package_joules_total` |The cumulative energy consumed by the CPU socket used by all containers running on the node and operating system. It includes all core and uncore components.

|`kepler_node_other_host_components_joules_total` |The cumulative energy consumption of host components, excluding CPU and DRAM, used by all containers running on the node and operating system. Generally, this metric is the energy consumption of ACPI hosts.

|`kepler_node_platform_joules_total` |The total energy consumption of the host. Generally, this metric is the host energy consumption from Redfish BMC or ACPI.

|`kepler_node_energy_stat` |Multiple metrics from nodes labeled with container resource utilization control group metrics that are used in the model server.

|`kepler_node_accelerator_intel_qat` |The utilization of the accelerator Intel QAT on a certain node. If the system contains Intel QATs, {PM-kepler} can calculate the utilization of the node's QATs through telemetry.
