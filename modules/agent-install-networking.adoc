= About networking

During the initial boot, the machines require an IP address configuration that is set either through a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol(DHCP) server or statically by
selecting the below options. If you provide the IP address for the `rendezvousIP` field through the DHCP option, then ensure that it is for the machine's IP address that is going to be used for deployment.
This IP address is required for a node to be identified as the rendezvous host. The rendezvous host runs the required services for the Agent-based Installer.

== DHCP

.Preferred method: `install-config.yaml` and `agent.config.yaml`

You must specify only the value for the `rendezvousIP` field and `networkConfig` field must be left blank:

.Sample agent-config.yaml.file

[source,yaml]
----
  cat > agent-config.yaml << EOF
  apiVersion: v1alpha1
  kind: AgentConfig
  metadata:
    name: sno-cluster
  rendezvousIP: 192.168.111.80 <1>
----
<1> The IP address for the rendezvous host.

== Static networking

.. Preferred method: `install-config.yaml` and `agent.config.yaml`
+
.Scenario-1

When you specify the value for the `rendezvousIP` and `networkConfig` fields, the `rendezvousIP` field is utilized.

                  prefix-length: 23
----

+
.Scenario-2
When you specify the values for the `networkConfig` field, the value from the `interfaces` field is utilized. This is when there is no `rendezvousIP` field.

----
<1> The static IP address of the target bare-metal host.
<2> The static IP address’s subnet prefix for the target bare-metal host.
+
Note that the lowest value IP is used as the rendezvous IP if no `rendezvousIP` is specified explicitly.

+
.. Optional method: ZTP manifests

+
The optional method of the ZTP custom resources comprises 6 custom resources; you can configure static IPs in the `NMStateConfig.yaml.file`.
