= About networking

The *rendezvous IP* must be known at the time of generating the agent ISO, so that during the initial boot all the hosts can check in to the assisted service.
If the IP addresses are assigned using a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, then the `rendezvousIP` field must be set to an IP address of one of the hosts that will become part of the deployed control plane.
In an environment without a DHCP server, you can define IP addresses statically.

In addition to static IP addresses, you can apply any network configuration that is in NMState format. This includes VLANs and NIC bonds.

== DHCP

.Preferred method: `install-config.yaml` and `agent-config.yaml`

You must specify the value for the `rendezvousIP` field. The `networkConfig` fields can be left blank:
