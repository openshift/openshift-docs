= About networking

The Rendezvous IP must be known at the time of generating the ISO, so that during the initial boot all of the hosts can check in to the assisted service. If IP addresses are assigned using a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, then the `rendezvousIP` field must be set to an IP address of one of the hosts that will become part of the deployed control plane. In environments with no DHCP server, IP addresses can also be statically defined.

In addition to static IPs, any network configuration that can be expressed in NMState format can be applied. This includes VLANs and NIC bonds.

== DHCP

.Preferred method: `install-config.yaml` and `agent.config.yaml`

You must specify the value for the `rendezvousIP` field. The `networkConfig` fields can be left blank:

.. Optional method: ZTP manifests

The optional method of the ZTP custom resources comprises 6 custom resources; you can configure static IPs in the `nmstateconfig.yaml.file`.
