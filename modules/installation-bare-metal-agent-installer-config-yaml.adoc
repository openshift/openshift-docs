= Sample install-config.yaml file for bare metal

You can customize the `install-config.yaml` file to specify more details about your {product-title} cluster's platform or modify the values of the required parameters.

----
<1> The base domain of the cluster. All DNS records must be sub-domains of this base and include the cluster name.
<2> The `controlPlane` section is a single mapping, but the `compute` section is a sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures, the first line of the `compute` section must begin with a hyphen, `-`, and the first line of the `controlPlane` section must not. Only one control plane pool is used.
<3> Specifies whether to enable or disable simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or hyperthreading. By default, SMT is enabled to increase the performance of the cores in your machines. You can disable it by setting the parameter value to `Disabled`. If you disable SMT, you must disable it in all cluster machines; this includes both control plane and compute machines.

+
[NOTE]
====
Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) is enabled by default. If SMT is not enabled in your BIOS settings, the `hyperthreading` parameter has no effect.
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you disable `hyperthreading`, whether in the BIOS or in the `install-config.yaml` file, ensure that your capacity planning accounts for the dramatically decreased machine performance.
====

<4> This parameter controls the number of compute machines that the Agent-based installation waits to discover before triggering the installation process. It is the number of compute machines that must be booted with the generated ISO.

+
[NOTE]
====
If you are installing a three-node cluster, do not deploy any compute machines when you install the {op-system-first} machines.
====
+
<5> The number of control plane machines that you add to the cluster. Because the cluster uses these values as the number of etcd endpoints in the cluster, the value must match the number of control plane machines that you deploy.
<6> The cluster name that you specified in your DNS records.
<7> A block of IP addresses from which pod IP addresses are allocated. This block must not overlap with existing physical networks. These IP addresses are used for the pod network. If you need to access the pods from an external network, you must configure load balancers and routers to manage the traffic.
+
[NOTE]
====
Class E CIDR range is reserved for a future use. To use the Class E CIDR range, you must ensure your networking environment accepts the IP addresses within the Class E CIDR range.
====
+
<8> The subnet prefix length to assign to each individual node. For example, if `hostPrefix` is set to `23`, then each node is assigned a `/23` subnet out of the given `cidr`, which allows for 510 (2^(32 - 23) - 2) pod IP addresses. If you are required to provide access to nodes from an external network, configure load balancers and routers to manage the traffic.
<9> The cluster network plug-in to install. The supported values are `OVNKubernetes` (default value) and `OpenShiftSDN`.
<10> The IP address pool to use for service IP addresses. You can enter only one IP address pool. This block must not overlap with existing physical networks. If you need to access the services from an external network, configure load balancers and routers to manage the traffic.
<11> You must set the platform to `none` for a single-node cluster. You can also set the platform to `vSphere` and `baremetal`.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you set the platform to `vSphere` or `baremetal`, you can configure IP address endpoints for cluster nodes in three ways:

* IPv4
* IPv6
* IPv4 and IPv6 in parallel (dual-stack)

====
<12> Whether to enable or disable FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the {op-system-first} machines that {product-title} runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with {op-system} instead.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The use of FIPS Validated / Modules in Process cryptographic libraries is only supported on {product-title} deployments on the `x86_64` architecture.
====

<13> This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the container images for {product-title} components.
<14> The SSH public key for the `core` user in {op-system-first}.
+
[NOTE]
====
For production {product-title} clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your `ssh-agent` process uses.
