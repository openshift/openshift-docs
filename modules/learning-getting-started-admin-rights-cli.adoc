+

----
+
* For `dedicated-admin`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa grant user dedicated-admin --user <idp_user_name> --cluster=<cluster-name>
----

. Verify that the admin privileges were added by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list users --cluster=<cluster-name>
----
+
*Example output*:
+
[source,terminal]

$ rosa list users --cluster=my-rosa-cluster
ID                 GROUPS
