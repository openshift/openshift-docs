= About volume snapshots

You can create snapshots of persistent volume claims (PVCs) that are provisioned by {lvms}.

You can perform the following actions using the volume snapshots:

* Back up your application data.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Volume snapshots are located on the same devices as the original data. To use the volume snapshots as backups, you must move the snapshots to a secure location. You can use OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) backup and restore solutions. For information about OADP, see "OADP features" in the "Additional resources" section.
====

* Revert to a state at which the volume snapshot was taken.

[NOTE]
====
You can also create volume snapshots of the volume clones.

== Limitations for creating volume snapshots in multi-node topology

{lvms} has the following limitations for creating volume snapshots in multi-node topology:

* Creating volume snapshots is based on the LVM thin pool capabilities.
* After creating a volume snapshot, the node must have additional storage space for further updating the original data source.
* You can create volume snapshots only on the node where you have deployed the original data source.
* Pods relying on the PVC that uses the snapshot data can be scheduled only on the node where you have deployed the original data source.
