= Vulnerability data sources

Sources for vulnerabilities depend on the scanner that is used in your system. {product-title-short} contains two scanners: StackRox Scanner and Scanner V4. StackRox Scanner is the default scanner and is deprecated beginning with release 4.6. Scanner V4 was introduced in release 4.4 and is the recommended image scanner.

[id="stackrox-scanner-vuln-sources"]
== StackRox Scanner sources

StackRox Scanner uses the following vulnerability sources:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/security/data/oval/v2/[Red{nbsp}Hat OVAL] v2
* link:https://secdb.alpinelinux.org/[Alpine Security Database]
* Data tracked in link:https://alas.aws.amazon.com/index.html[Amazon Linux Security Center]
* link:https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/json[Debian Security Tracker]
* link:https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cve-tracker/[Ubuntu CVE Tracker]
* link:https://nvd.nist.gov/[NVD]: This is used for various purposes such as filling in information gaps when vendors do not provide information. For example, Alpine does not provide a description, CVSS score, severity, or published date.

[id="scanner-v4-vuln-sources"]
== Scanner V4 sources

Scanner V4 uses the following vulnerability sources:

link:https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/[Red{nbsp}Hat VEX]:: Used with release 4.6 and later. This source provides vulnerability data in link:https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/os/csaf-v2.0-os.html#45-profile-5-vex[Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange(VEX)] format. {product-title-short} takes advantage of VEX benefits to significantly decrease the time needed for the initial loading of vulnerability data, and the space needed to store vulnerability data.
+
{product-title-short} might list a different number of vulnerabilities when you are scanning with a {product-title-short} version that uses OVAL, such as {product-title-short} version 4.5, and a version that uses VEX, such as version 4.6. For example, {product-title-short} no longer displays vulnerabilities with a status of "under investigation," while these vulnerabilities were included with previous versions that used OVAL data.
+
For more information about Red Hat security data, including information about the use of OVAL, Common Security Advisory Framework Version 2.0 (CSAF), and VEX, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/future-red-hat-security-data[The future of Red Hat security data].
link:https://osv.dev/[OSV]:: This is used for language-related vulnerabilities, such as Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. This source might provide
vulnerability IDs other than CVE IDs for vulnerabilities, such as a GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA) ID.
+
[NOTE]
====
{product-title-short} uses the OSV database available at link:https://osv.dev/[OSV.dev] under link:https://github.com/google/osv.dev/blob/master/LICENSE[Apache License 2.0].
