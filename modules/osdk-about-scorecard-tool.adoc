= About the scorecard tool

To validate an Operator, the scorecard tool provided by the Operator SDK begins by creating all resources required by any related custom resources (CRs) and the Operator. The scorecard then creates a proxy container in the deployment of the Operator which is used to record calls to the API server and run some of the tests. The tests performed also examine some of the parameters in the CRs.
