= Considerations for using OLM with {microshift-short}

[role="_abstract"]
You must consider the application of Operators and steps to use them when planning which ones you want to use with your {microshift-short} platform.

* Cluster Operators as applied in {ocp} are not used in {microshift-short}.
* You must create your own catalogs for the add-on Operators you want to use with your applications. Catalogs are not provided by default.
** Each catalog must have an accessible `CatalogSource` added to a node, so that the OLM catalog Operator can use the catalog for content.

You must use the CLI to conduct OLM activities with {microshift-short}. The console and OperatorHub GUIs are not available.

* Use the Operator Package Manager (`opm`) CLI with a network-connected node, or for building catalogs for custom Operators that use an internal registry. See the following link for more information:

** link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-version}/html/cli_tools/opm-cli#cli-opm-install[Operator Package Manager `opm` CLI]

* To mirror your catalogs and Operators for disconnected or offline nodes, install the oc-mirror tool. See the following link for more information:

** link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-version}/html-single/disconnected_environments/index#installation-oc-mirror-installing-plugin_about-installing-oc-mirror-v2[Installing the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI plugin]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before using an Operator, verify with the provider that the Operator is supported on {microshift-short}.
