= Considerations for using OLM with {microshift-short}

[role="_abstract"]
You must consider the application of Operators and steps to use them when planning which ones you want to use with your {microshift-short} platform.

* Cluster Operators as applied in {ocp} are not used in {microshift-short}.
* You must create your own catalogs for the add-on Operators you want to use with your applications. Catalogs are not provided by default.
** Each catalog must have an accessible `CatalogSource` added to a node, so that the OLM catalog Operator can use the catalog for content.
* You must use the CLI to conduct OLM activities with {microshift-short}. The console and OperatorHub GUIs are not available.
** Use the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-version}/html/cli_tools/opm-cli#cli-opm-install[Operator Package Manager `opm` CLI] with a network-connected node, or for building catalogs for custom Operators that use an internal registry.
** To mirror your catalogs and Operators for disconnected or offline nodes, install link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp-version}/installing/disconnected_install/installing-mirroring-disconnected.html#installation-oc-mirror-installing-plugin_installing-mirroring-disconnected[the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI plugin].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before using an Operator, verify with the provider that the Operator is supported on {product-title}.
