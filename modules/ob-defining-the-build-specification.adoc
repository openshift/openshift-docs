= Build specification definition

You can embed a complete build specification into your `BuildRun` resource using the `spec.build.spec` field. By embedding specifications, you can build an image without creating and maintaining a dedicated `Build` custom resource. The following example shows a `BuildRun` CR that configures the `spec.build.spec` field:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: shipwright.io/v1beta1
kind: BuildRun
metadata:
  name: standalone-buildrun
spec:
   build:
    spec:
      source:
        git:
          url: https://github.com/shipwright-io/sample-go.git
        contextDir: source-build
      strategy:
        kind: ClusterBuildStrategy
        name: buildah
      output:
        image: <path_to_image>
----

[NOTE]
====
You cannot use the `spec.build.name` and `spec.build.spec` fields together in the same CR because they are mutually exclusive.
