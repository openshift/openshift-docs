{product-title} clusters are hosted in an AWS account within an AWS organizational unit. A link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html[service control policy (SCP)] is created and applied to the AWS organizational unit that manages what services the AWS sub-accounts are permitted to access.

* Ensure that your organization's SCPs are not more restrictive than the roles and policies required by the cluster.
* When you create a {product-title} cluster, an associated AWS OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider is created.
