[id="workaround-for-openshift-adp-controller-segmentation-fault_{context}"]
= Workaround for OpenShift ADP Controller segmentation fault

[role="_abstract"]
If you configure a Data Protection Application (DPA) with both `cloudstorage` and `restic` enabled, the `openshift-adp-controller-manager` pod crashes and restarts indefinitely until the pod fails with a crash loop segmentation fault.

Define either `velero` or `cloudstorage` when you configure a DPA. Otherwise, the `openshift-adp-controller-manager` pod fails with a crash loop segmentation fault due to the following settings:

* If you define both `velero` and `cloudstorage`, the `openshift-adp-controller-manager` fails.
* If you do not define both `velero` and `cloudstorage`, the `openshift-adp-controller-manager` fails.
