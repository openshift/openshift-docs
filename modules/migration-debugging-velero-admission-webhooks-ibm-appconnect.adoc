= Restoring {ibm-title} AppConnect resources

If you experience issues when you use Velero to a restore an {ibm-name} AppConnect resource that has an admission webhook, you can run the checks in this procedure.

.Procedure

. Check if you have any mutating admission plugins of `kind: MutatingWebhookConfiguration` in the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get mutatingwebhookconfigurations
----

. Examine the YAML file of each `kind: MutatingWebhookConfiguration` to ensure that none of its rules block creation of the objects that are experiencing issues. For more information, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.23/#rulewithoperations-v1-admissionregistration-k8s-io[the official Kubernetes documentation].

. Check that any `spec.version` in `type: Configuration.appconnect.ibm.com/v1beta1` used at backup time is supported by the installed Operator.
