= Installing Pipelines-as-Code as GitHub Application

This section demonstrates installation, creation, and configuration of Pipelines-as-Code GitHub App of your cluster.

.Procedure

== Installing Pipelines as Code infrastructure

. Run the following command to install Pipelines-as-Code on your cluster.

----
VERSION=0.5.1
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-pipelines/pipelines-as-code/release-$VERSION/release-$VERSION.yaml
----

If you would like to install the current development version you can simply
install it like this:

----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-pipelines/pipelines-as-code/nightly/release.yaml
----

It will apply the release.yaml to your kubernetes cluster, creating the admin namespace `pipelines-as-code`, the roles and all other bits needed.

The `pipelines-as-code` namespace is where the Pipelines-as-Code infrastructure runs and is supposed to be accessible only by the admins.

The Route for the EventListener URL is automatically created when you apply the `release.yaml`. You will need to grab the url for the next section when creating the GitHub App. You can run this command to get the route created on your cluster:

----
echo https://$(oc get route -n pipelines-as-code el-pipelines-as-code-interceptor -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
----

== RBAC

Non `system:admin` users needs to be allowed explicated to create repositories CRD in their namespace

To allow them you need to create a `RoleBinding` on the namespace to the `openshift-pipeline-as-code-clusterrole`.

For example assuming we want user being able to create repository CRD in the naemspace `user-ci`, if we use the openshift `oc` cli:

----
oc adm policy add-role-to-user openshift-pipeline-as-code-clusterrole user -n user-ci
----

== Create a Pipelines-as-Code GitHub App

You should now create a Pipelines-as-Code GitHub App which acts as the integration point with OpenShift Pipelines and brings the Git workflow into Tekton pipelines. You need the webhook of the GitHub App pointing to your Pipelines-as-Code EventListener route endpoint which would then trigger pipelines on GitHub events.

. Go to https://github.com/settings/apps (or Settings > Developer settings > GitHub Apps) and click on New GitHub App button

. Provide the following info in the GitHub App form:
.. GitHub Application Name: `OpenShift Pipelines`
.. Homepage URL: [OpenShift Console URL]
.. Webhook URL: [the EventListener route URL copies in the previous section]
.. Webhook secret: [an arbitrary secret, you can generate one with `openssl rand -hex 20`]

. Select the following repository permissions:
.. Checks: Read & Write
.. Contents: Read & Write
.. Issues: Read & Write
.. Metadata: Readonly
.. Pull request: Read & Write

. Select the following organization permissions:
.. Members: Readonly
.. Plan: Readonly

. Select the following user permissions:
.. Commit comment
.. Issue comment
.. Pull request
.. Pull request review
.. Pull request review comment
.. Push

. Click on Create GitHub App.

. Take note of the App ID at the top of the page on the details page of the GitHub App you just created.

. In Private keys section, click on *Generate Private key to generate a private key for the GitHub app. It will download automatically. Store the private key in a safe place as you need it in the next section and in future when reconfiguring this app to use a different cluster.

== Configure Pipelines-as-Code on your cluster to access the GitHub App

In order for Pipelines-as-Code to be able to authenticate to the GitHub App and have the GitHub App securely trigger the Pipelines-as-Code webhook, you need to create a Kubernetes secret containing the private key of the GitHub App and the webhook secret of the Pipelines-as-Code as it was provided when you created the GitHub App in the previous section. This secret is used to generate a token on behalf of the user running the event and make sure to validate the webhook via the webhook secret.

Run the following command and replace:

. `APP_ID` with the GitHub App App ID copied in the previous section
. `WEBHOOK_SECRET` with the webhook secret provided when created the GitHub App in the previous section
. `PATH_PRIVATE_KEY` with the path to the private key that was downloaded in the previous section

----
kubectl -n pipelines-as-code create secret generic pipelines-as-code-secret \
        --from-literal github-private-key="$(cat PATH_PRIVATE_KEY)" \
        --from-literal github-application-id="APP_ID" \
        --from-literal webhook.secret="WEBHOOK_SECRET"
----

== GitHub Enterprise

Pipelines as Code supports Github Enterprise.

You don't need to do anything special to get Pipelines as code working with GHE. Pipelines as code will automatically detects the header as set from GHE and use it the GHE API auth url instead of the public github.
