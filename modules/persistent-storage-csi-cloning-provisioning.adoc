= Provisioning a CSI volume clone

Provisioning of a CSI volume clone is triggered by the creation of a cloned persistent volume claim (PVC) API object. The cloned PVC is pre-populated with the contents of another PVC. After creation, the cloned volume adheres to the same rules as any other persistent volume.

.Prerequisites
* Logged in to a running {product-title} cluster.
* A PVC created using a CSI driver that supports volume cloning.
* Storage back end is configured for dynamic provisioning. Cloning support is not available for static provisioners.
* Source and destination PVCs must exist in the same namespace.
* Source and destination storage class must be the same.

.Procedure

Clones are provisioned like any other PVC, with the exception of adding a `dataSource` that references an existing PVC in the same namespace.

To clone a PVC from an existing PVC:

. Define the PersistentVolumeClaim object as shown in the following example:

+
.pvc-clone.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc-1-clone
  namespace: mynamespace
spec:
  storageClassName: csi-cloning <1>
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
----
+
<1> Name of the storage class that provisions the storage back end. Default storage class can be used and `storageClassName` can be omitted in the spec.
+
. Create the object you saved in the previous step by running the following command:
+
----
$ oc create -f pvc-clone.yaml
----
+
A new PVC `pvc-1-clone` is created.

. Verify that the volume clone was created and is ready by running the following command:
+
----
$ oc get pvc pvc-1-clone
----
+
The `pvc-1-clone` shows that it is `Bound`.
