= About document title and URL

[role="_abstract"]

{ols-long} can display the titles and URLs of the documents that the Service uses to generate answers. In the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) database, titles and URLs accompany documents as metadata. The BYO Knowledge tool can obtain the title and url attributes from YAML frontmatter if they reside in the Markdown files that the tool processes.

title: "Introduction to Layers {#gimp-concepts-layers}"
url: "https://docs.gimp.org/3.0/en/gimp-using-layers.html"

# Introduction to Layers

If a Markdown file does not have frontmatter with the `title` and `url` attributes, the first top-level Markdown heading, for example `# Introduction to Layers`, becomes the title and the file path becomes the URL.
