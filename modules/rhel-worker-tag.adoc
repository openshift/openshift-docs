= Tagging a {op-system-base} worker node as owned or shared

A cluster uses the value of the `kubernetes.io/cluster/<clusterid>,Value=(owned|shared)` tag to determine the lifetime of the resources related to the AWS cluster.

* The `owned` tag value should be added if the resource should be destroyed as part of destroying the cluster.
* The `shared` tag value should be added if the resource continues to exist after the cluster has been destroyed. This tagging denotes that the cluster uses this resource, but there is a separate owner for the resource.

.Procedure

* With {op-system-base} compute machines, the {op-system-base} worker instance must be tagged with `kubernetes.io/cluster/<clusterid>=owned` or `kubernetes.io/cluster/<cluster-id>=shared`.

[NOTE]
====
Do not tag all existing security groups with the `kubernetes.io/cluster/<name>,Value=<clusterid>` tag, or the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) will not be able to create a load balancer.
