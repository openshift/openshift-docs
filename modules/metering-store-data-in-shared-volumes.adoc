= Storing data in shared volumes

[NOTE]
====
NFS is not recommended to use with metering. 
====

Metering has no storage by default, but it can use any ReadWriteMany PersistentVolume or any StorageClass that provisions a ReadWriteMany PersistentVolume.

.Procedure
* To use a ReadWriteMany PersistentVolume for storage, modify the `shared-storage.yaml` file below.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metering.openshift.io/v1
kind: MeteringConfig
metadata:
  name: "operator-metering"
spec:
  storage:
    type: "hive"
    hive:
      type: "sharedPVC"
      sharedPVC:
        claimName: "metering-nfs" <1>
        # uncomment the lines below to provision a new PVC using the specified <2>
        # storageClass.
        # createPVC: true
        # storageClass: "my-nfs-storage-class"
        # size: 5Gi
----

Select one of the configuration options below:

<1> Set `storage.hive.sharedPVC.claimName` to the name of an existing ReadWriteMany PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC). This is necessary if you do not have dynamic volume provisioning or want to have more control over how the PersistentVolume is created.

<2> Set `storage.hive.sharedPVC.createPVC` to `true` and set the `storage.hive.sharedPVC.storageClass` to the name of a StorageClass with ReadWriteMany access mode. This will use dynamic volume provisioning to have a volume created automatically.
