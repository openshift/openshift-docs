[id="microshift-greenboot-workload-health-check-script-ex_{context}"]
= Workload max duration or timeout script example

The following example uses the {microshift-short} core services health check script as a template.

[id="microshift-greenboot-app-health-check-basic-prereqs_{context}"]
== Basic prerequisites for creating a health check script

* The workload must be installed.
* You must have root access.

[id="microshift-greenboot-app-health-check-ex_{context}"]
== Example and functional requirements

You can start with the following example health check script. Add to it for your use case. In your custom workload health check script, you must define the relevant namespace, deployment, `daemonset`, and `statefulset`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Choose a name prefix for your application that ensures it runs after the `40_microshift_running_check.sh` script, which implements the {microshift-short} health check procedure for its core services.

[source, bash]

#!/bin/bash
set -e

SCRIPT_NAME=$(basename $0)

# Load the workload health check functions library
source /usr/share/microshift/functions/greenboot.sh

# Stop the script if the user running it is not 'root'
if [ $(id -u) -ne 0 ] ; then
    echo "The '${SCRIPT_NAME}' script must be run with the 'root' user privileges"
    exit 1

echo "STARTED"

# Set the wait timeout for the current check based on the boot counter
WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECS=$(get_wait_timeout)

[IMPORTANT]
====
Functions related to checking workload health previously included in the `/usr/share/microshift/functions/greenboot.sh` script file are deprecated. You can write a custom script, or use the `microshift healthcheck` command with various options instead. See "How workload health check scripts work" for more information.
