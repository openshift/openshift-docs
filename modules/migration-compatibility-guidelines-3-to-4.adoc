= Compatibility guidelines

You must install the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) Operator that is compatible with your {product-title} version.

.Definitions

control cluster:: The cluster that runs the {mtc-short} controller and GUI.
remote cluster:: A source or destination cluster for a migration that runs Velero. The Control Cluster communicates with Remote clusters using the Velero API to drive migrations.

You must use the compatible {mtc-short} version for migrating your {product-title} clusters. For the migration to succeed, both your source cluster and the destination cluster must use the same version of {mtc-short}.

{mtc-short} 1.7 supports migrations from {product-title} 3.11 to 4.17.

{mtc-short} 1.8 only supports migrations from {product-title} 4.14 and later.

|Installation

|===

Edge cases exist where network restrictions prevent {product-title} 4 clusters from connecting to other clusters involved in the migration. For example, when migrating from an {product-title} 3.11 cluster on premises to a {product-title} 4 cluster in the cloud,  the {product-title} 4 cluster might have trouble connecting to the {product-title} 3.11 cluster. In this case, it is possible to designate the {product-title} 3.11 cluster as the control cluster and push workloads to the remote {product-title} 4 cluster.
