= Adding logical conditions for the policy criteria

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the drag-and-drop policy fields panel to specify logical conditions for the policy criteria.

.Prerequisites
* You must be using {product-title} version 3.0.45 or newer.

.Procedure
. In the *Policy Criteria* section, select *Add a new condition* to add a new policy section.
** You can click on the *Edit* icon icon:edit[] to rename the policy section.
** The *Drag out a policy field* section lists available policy criteria in multiple categories.
You can expand and collapse these categories to view the policy criteria attributes.
. Drag an attribute to the *Drop a policy field inside* area of the policy section.
. Depending on the type of the attribute you select, you get different options to configure the conditions for the selected attribute.
For example:
** If you select an attribute with Boolean values `Read-Only Root Filesystem`, you will see `READ-ONLY` and `WRITABLE` options.
** If you select an attribute with compound values `Environment variable`, you will see options to enter values for `Key`, `Value`, and `Value From` fields, and an icon to add more values for the available options.
.. To combine multiple values for an attribute, click the *Add* icon:plus-circle []icon.
.. You can also click on the logical operator `AND` or `OR` listed in a policy section, to toggle between `AND` and `OR` operators.
Toggling between operators only works inside a policy section and not between two different policy sections.
. You can specify more than one `AND` and `OR` condition by repeating these steps.
After you configure the conditions for the added attributes, click *Next* to continue with the policy creation.
