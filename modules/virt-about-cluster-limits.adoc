= About cluster limits for {VirtProductName}

To view the supported cluster limits for guests, hosts, and other objects, refer to link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6571671[Supported Limits for {VirtProductName} 4.x].

Red Hat has tested these values to ensure optimal cluster and workload performance. Exceeding the documented limits might result in unexpected behavior and degraded performance.

[NOTE]
====
Guidelines for object maximums are based on the largest possible cluster. For smaller clusters, the maximums are lower.
