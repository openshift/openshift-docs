= OpenTelemetry Collector configuration options

The OpenTelemetry Collector consists of three components that access telemetry data:

Receivers:: A receiver, which can be push or pull based, is how data gets into the Collector. Generally, a receiver accepts data in a specified format, translates it into the internal format, and passes it to processors and exporters defined in the applicable pipelines. By default, no receivers are configured. One or more receivers must be configured. Receivers may support one or more data sources.

Processors:: Optional. Processors run through the data between it is received and exported. By default, no processors are enabled. Processors must be enabled for every data source. Not all processors support all data sources. Depending on the data source, multiple processors might be enabled. Note that the order of processors matters.

Exporters:: An exporter, which can be push or pull based, is how you send data to one or more back ends or destinations. By default, no exporters are configured. One or more exporters must be configured. Exporters can support one or more data sources. Exporters might be used with their default settings, but many exporters require configuration to specify at least the destination and security settings.

You can define multiple instances of components in a custom resource YAML file. When configured, these components must be enabled through pipelines defined in the `spec.config.service` section of the YAML file. As a best practice, only enable the components that you need.

==== Span Processor


This processor modifies the span name based on its attributes or extract span attributes from the span name. It also could change span status.It can also include or exclude spans.

* Support level: link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview]
* Supported signals: traces

For span renaming need to specify with attributes the new name is gonna be created, to do that use `from_attributes` configuration.

      # Let's assume input span name is /api/v1/document/12345678/update
      # Applying the following results in output span name /api/v1/document/{documentId}/update
      # and will add a new attribute "documentId"="12345678" to the span.

----
<1> This rule defined how the extraction will be executed, we can define more rules, in this case if the regexp match the name
    a documentID attibute will be created.

The span status can also be modified in the following way

----


==== Kubernetes Attributes Processor

The Kubernetes attributes processor enables automatic configuration of spans, metrics, and log resource attributes using Kubernetes metadata.

This processor automatically identifies Kubernetes resources, extracts metadata from them, and incorporates this extracted metadata as resource attributes into relevant spans, metrics, and logs. It utilizes the Kubernetes API to discover all pods operating within a cluster, maintaining records of their IP addresses, pod UIDs, and other relevant metadata.

=== Resource Detection Processor

The resource detection processor is employed to identify resource details from the host, structured in accordance with OpenTelemetry's resource semantic conventions. It then appends or replaces the resource value within telemetry data with this gathered information.


This processor supports multiple detectors like docker metadata which extract information from the docker daemon, GCP, AWS for extracting information from those enviromnents. A common usage of this processor is whith environment variable detector,  it will read the informatiton from the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable that should be in the format `<key1>=<value1>,<key2>=<value2>,...`

        timeout: 2s
        override: false
----
<1> Specify which detector to use, in this case environment detector

=== Filter Processor

The filter processor leverages the OpenTelemetry Transformation Language to establish criteria for deciding when to discard telemetry data. If any of these conditions are satisfied, the telemetry data is discarded, with each condition being combined through a logical OR operation. 

* Support level: link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview]
* Supported signals: logs, metrics, traces

          - 'resource.attributes["host.name"] == "localhost"' <3>
----
<1> Define error mode, there are two possible values for this, ignore which  ignores errors returned by conditions and continues on to the next conditionm and propagate which returns the error up the pipeline. This will result in the payload being dropped from the collector.
<2> Filter the spans that have the attribute `container.name == app_container_1`
<3> Filter the spans that have the resource attribute `host.name == localhost`

=== Routing processor

Routes logs, metrics or traces to specific exporters. This processor will either read a header from the incoming HTTP request (gRPC or plain HTTP), or it will read a resource attribute, and direct the trace information to specific exporters based on the value read.

<2> Default exporter when the attribute value is not present in the tablel
<3> Table that defines which values are gonna be routed to which exporters


Optionally can be set `attribute_source` configuratiion, which defines where to look for the attribute in from_attribute. The allowed values are: context to search the context, which includes HTTP headers or resource to search the resource attributes.
