= OpenTelemetry Collector configuration options

The OpenTelemetry Collector consists of three components that access telemetry data:

Receivers:: A receiver, which can be push or pull based, is how data gets into the Collector. Generally, a receiver accepts data in a specified format, translates it into the internal format, and passes it to processors and exporters defined in the applicable pipelines. By default, no receivers are configured. One or more receivers must be configured. Receivers may support one or more data sources.

Processors:: Optional. Processors run through the data between it is received and exported. By default, no processors are enabled. Processors must be enabled for every data source. Not all processors support all data sources. Depending on the data source, multiple processors might be enabled. Note that the order of processors matters.

Exporters:: An exporter, which can be push or pull based, is how you send data to one or more back ends or destinations. By default, no exporters are configured. One or more exporters must be configured. Exporters can support one or more data sources. Exporters might be used with their default settings, but many exporters require configuration to specify at least the destination and security settings.

Connectors:: A connector connects two pipelines: It consumes data as an exporter at the end of one pipeline and emits data as a receiver at the start of another pipeline. It can consume and emit data of the same or different data type. It can generate and emit data to summarize the consumed data, or it can merely replicate or route data.

You can define multiple instances of components in a custom resource YAML file. When configured, these components must be enabled through pipelines defined in the `spec.config.service` section of the YAML file. As a best practice, only enable the components that you need.

==== Jaeger Remote Sampling extension

This extension allows serving sampling strategies after Jaeger's remote sampling API. You can configure this extension to proxy requests to a backing remote sampling server such as a Jaeger collector down the pipeline or to a static JSON file from the local file system.

----
<1> The endpoint at which this extension listens. Use `localhost:` to make it available only locally or `":"` to make it available on all network interfaces. The default value is `localhost:1777`.
<2> Sets a fraction of blocking events to be profiled. To disable profiling, set this to `0` or a negative integer. See the link:https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#SetBlockProfileRate[documentation] for the `runtime` package. The default value is `0`.
<3> Set a fraction of mutex contention events to be profiled. To disable profiling, set this to `0` or a negative integer. See the link:https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#SetMutexProfileFraction[documentation] for the `runtime` package. The default value is `0`.
<4> The name of the file in which the CPU profile is to be saved. Profiling starts when the Collector starts. Profiling is saved to the file when the Collector is terminated.
