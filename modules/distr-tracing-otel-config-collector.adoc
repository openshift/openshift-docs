= OpenTelemetry Collector configuration options

The OpenTelemetry Collector consists of three components that access telemetry data:

Receivers:: A receiver, which can be push or pull based, is how data gets into the Collector. Generally, a receiver accepts data in a specified format, translates it into the internal format, and passes it to processors and exporters defined in the applicable pipelines. By default, no receivers are configured. One or more receivers must be configured. Receivers may support one or more data sources.

Processors:: Optional. Processors run through the data between it is received and exported. By default, no processors are enabled. Processors must be enabled for every data source. Not all processors support all data sources. Depending on the data source, multiple processors might be enabled. Note that the order of processors matters.

Exporters:: An exporter, which can be push or pull based, is how you send data to one or more back ends or destinations. By default, no exporters are configured. One or more exporters must be configured. Exporters can support one or more data sources. Exporters might be used with their default settings, but many exporters require configuration to specify at least the destination and security settings.

You can define multiple instances of components in a custom resource YAML file. When configured, these components must be enabled through pipelines defined in the `spec.config.service` section of the YAML file. As a best practice, only enable the components that you need.

[cols="3",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description |Default

| `timeout`
| Sends the batch after a specific time duration, irrespective of its size.
| 200ms

| `send_batch_size`
| Sends the batch of telemetry data after the specified number of spans or metrics.
| 8192

| `send_batch_max_size`
| The maximum allowable size of the batch. Must be equal or greater than `send_batch_size`.
| 0

| `metadata_keys`
| When activated, a batcher instance is created for each unique set of values found in the `client.Metadata`.
| []

| `metadata_cardinality_limit`
| When the `metadata_keys` are populated, this configuration restricts the number of distinct metadata key-value combinations processed throughout the duration of the process.
| 1000
|===

[id="memorylimiter-processor_{context}"]
==== Memory Limiter processor

The Memory Limiter processor periodically checks the Collector's memory usage and pauses data processing when the soft memory limit is reached.
The preceding component, which is typically a receiver, is expected to retry sending the same data and may apply a backpressure to the incoming data.
When memory usage exceeds the hard limit, the Memory Limiter processor forces garbage collection to run.

* Support level: General Availability
* Supported signals: traces, metrics, logs

----

.Parameters used by the Memory Limiter processor
[cols="3",options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Description | Default

| `check_interval`
| Time between memory usage measurements. The optimal value is 1s. For spiky traffic patterns, you can decrease the `check_interval` or increase the `spike_limit_mib`.
| `0s`

| `limit_mib`
| The hard limit, which is the maximum amount of memory in MiB allocated on the heap. Typically, the total memory usage of the OpenTelemetry Collector is about 50 MiB greater than this value.
| `0`

| `spike_limit_mib`
| Spike limit, which is the maximum expected spike of memory usage in MiB. The optimal value is approximately 20% of `limit_mib`. To calculate the soft limit, subtract the `spike_limit_mib` from the `limit_mib`.
| 20% of `limit_mib`

| `limit_percentage`
| Same as the `limit_mib` but expressed as a percentage of the total available memory. The `limit_mib` setting takes precedence over this setting.
| `0`

| `spike_limit_percentage`
| Same as the `spike_limit_mib` but expressed as a percentage of the total available memory. Intended to be used with the `limit_percentage` setting.
| `0`
