= Understanding VirtIO drivers

VirtIO drivers are paravirtualized device drivers required for Microsoft Windows
 virtual machines to run in {ProductName}. The supported drivers are 
available in the `cnv-tech-preview/virtio-win` container disk of the 
link:https://access.redhat.com/containers/?count=50#/product/5be1983a5a13463a3e1d8ef4[Red Hat Container Catalog].

The `cnv-tech-preview/virtio-win` container disk must be attached to the virtual machine as a 
SATA CD drive to enable driver installation. You can install VirtIO drivers during 
Windows installation on the virtual machine or added to an 
existing Windows installation.

After the drivers are installed, the `cnv-tech-preview/virtio-win` container disk can be removed 
from the virtual machine.
