= Creating policies in code by constructing a CR

[role="_abstract"]
You can create new policies in code by constructing a CR for the policy.

. Use an editor to construct a CR for the policy with the following attributes:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: SecurityPolicy
apiVersion: config.stackrox.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: short-name
spec:
  policyName: A longer form name
# ...
----
+
[TIP]
====
Use online documentation, for example, by entering the `kubectl explain securitypolicy.spec` command, to understand the fields available for defining a policy specification.
====
. Apply the saved CR by doing one of the following:

* Use the `oc apply` or `kubectl apply` command to apply the CR directly to the Kubernetes namespace where Central is installed.
* Use Argo CD or your GitOps tool to push the CR to the Kubernetes namespace where Central is installed.
