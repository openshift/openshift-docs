= Accessing hosts on Amazon Web Services in an installer-provisioned infrastructure cluster

The {product-title} installer does not create any public IP addresses for any of
the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that it provisions for
your {product-title} cluster. In order to be able to SSH to your {product-title}
hosts, you must follow this procedure.

.Procedure

. Create a security group that allows SSH access into the virtual private cloud
(VPC) created by the `openshift-install` command.

. Create an Amazon EC2 instance on one of the public subnets the installer
created.

. Associate a public IP address with the Amazon EC2 instance that you created.
+
Unlike with the {product-title} installation, you should associate the Amazon
EC2 instance you created with an SSH keypair. It does not matter what operating
system you choose for this instance, as it will simply serve as an SSH bastion
to bridge the internet into your {product-title} cluster's VPC. The Amazon
Machine Image (AMI) you use does matter. With {op-system-first},
for example, you can provide keys via Ignition, like the installer does.

. Once you provisioned your Amazon EC2 instance and can SSH into it, you must add
the SSH key that you associated with your {product-title} installation. This key
can be different from the key for the bastion instance, but does not have to be.
+
[NOTE]
====
Direct SSH access is only recommended for disaster recovery. When the Kubernetes
API is responsive, run privileged pods instead.
====

. Run `oc get nodes`, inspect the output, and choose one of the nodes that is a
master. The host name looks similar to `ip-10-0-1-163.ec2.internal`.

. From the bastion SSH host you manually deployed into Amazon EC2, SSH into that
master host. Ensure that you use the same SSH key you specified during the
installation:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ssh -i <ssh-key-path> core@<master-hostname>
