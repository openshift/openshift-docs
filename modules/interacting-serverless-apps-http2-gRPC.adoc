[id="interacting-serverless-apps-http2-gRPC_{context}"]
= Interacting with a serverless application using HTTP2 / gRPC

{product-title} routes do not support HTTP2, and therefore do not support gRPC, as this is transported by HTTP2.

If you use HTTP2 or gRPC protocols in your application, you must call the application using the ingress gateway directly, by finding the ingress gateway's public address and the application's specific host.

.Procedure

. Find the application host. See the instructions in _Verifying your serverless application deployment_.
. The ingress gateway's public address can be determined using this command:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n knative-serving-ingress get svc kourier

NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP                                                             PORT(S)                                                                                                                                      AGE
kourier   LoadBalancer   172.30.51.103   a83e86291bcdd11e993af02b7a65e514-33544245.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com   80:31380/TCP,443:31390/TCP   67m
----

+
The public address is surfaced in the `EXTERNAL-IP` field, and in this case would be `a83e86291bcdd11e993af02b7a65e514-33544245.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`.

. Manually set the host header of your HTTP request to the application’s host, but direct the request itself against the public address of the ingress gateway.
+
Here is an example, using the information obtained from the steps in  _Verifying your serverless application deployment_:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -H "Host: hello-default.example.com" a83e86291bcdd11e993af02b7a65e514-33544245.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
Hello Serverless!
----

+
You can also make a gRPC request by setting the authority to the application’s host, while directing the request against the ingress gateway directly.
+
Here is an example of what that looks like in the Golang gRPC client:
+

[source,terminal]
----
grpc.Dial(
    "a83e86291bcdd11e993af02b7a65e514-33544245.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com:80",
    grpc.WithAuthority("hello-default.example.com:80"),
    grpc.WithInsecure(),
)
----

+
[NOTE]
====
Ensure that you append the respective port (80 by default) to both hosts as shown in the example.
