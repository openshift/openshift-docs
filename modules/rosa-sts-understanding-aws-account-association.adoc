clusters that use the AWS Security Token Service (STS), you must associate your AWS account with your Red{nbsp}Hat organization. You can associate your account by creating and linking the following IAM roles.

{cluster-manager} role:: Create an {cluster-manager} IAM role and link it to your Red{nbsp}Hat organization.
+
You can apply basic or administrative permissions to the {cluster-manager} role. The basic permissions enable cluster maintenance using {cluster-manager}. The administrative permissions enable automatic deployment of the cluster-specific Operator roles and the OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider using {cluster-manager}.

+
You can use the administrative permissions with the {cluster-manager} role to deploy a cluster quickly.
endif::quick-install[]

User role:: Create a user IAM role and link it to your Red{nbsp}Hat user account. The Red{nbsp}Hat user account must exist in the Red{nbsp}Hat organization that is linked to your {cluster-manager} role.
+
The user role is used by Red{nbsp}Hat to verify your AWS identity when you use the {cluster-manager} {hybrid-console-second} to install a cluster and the required STS resources.
