= Creating the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files

Because you must manually start the cluster machines, you must generate the
Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files that the cluster needs to make its
machines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain
certificates that expire after 24 hours. You must complete your cluster
installation and keep the cluster running for 24 hours in a non-degraded state
to ensure that the first certificate rotation has finished.
====

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the {product-title} installation program.
ifdef::restricted[]
For a restricted network installation, these files are on your bastion host.
endif::restricted[]
* Create the `install-config.yaml` installation configuration file.

.Procedure

. Generate the Kubernetes manifests for the cluster:
+
----
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir=<installation_directory> <1>

WARNING There are no compute nodes specified. The cluster will not fully initialize without compute nodes.
INFO Consuming "Install Config" from target directory
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the installation directory that
contains the `install-config.yaml` file you created.
+
Because you create your own compute machines later in the installation process,
you can safely ignore this warning.

. Remove the Kubernetes manifest files that define the control plane machines:
+
----
$ rm -f openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_master-machines-*.yaml
----
+
By removing these files, you prevent the cluster from automatically generating control plane machines.

. Remove the Kubernetes manifest files that define the worker machines:
+
----
$ rm -f openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_worker-machineset-*
----
+
Because you create and manage the worker machines yourself, you do not need
to initialize these machines.

. Obtain the Ignition config files:
+
----
$ ./openshift-install create ignition-configs --dir=<installation_directory> <1>
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the same installation directory.
+
The following files are generated in the directory:
+

├── auth
│   ├── kubeadmin-password
│   └── kubeconfig
├── bootstrap.ign
├── master.ign
├── metadata.json
└── worker.ign
