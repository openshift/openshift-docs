= Log forwarder feature

The log forwarder feature provides the following functionality:

* Administrators can control which users are allowed to define log collection and which logs they are allowed to collect.
* Users who have the required permissions are able to specify additional log collection configurations.
* Administrators who are migrating from the deprecated Fluentd collector to the Vector collector can deploy a new log forwarder separately from their existing deployment. The existing and new log forwarders can operate simultaneously while workloads are being migrated.

You can create `ClusterLogForwarder` resources using any name and in any namespace.
