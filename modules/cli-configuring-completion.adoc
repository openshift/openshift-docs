= Enabling tab completion

After you install the `oc` CLI tool, you can enable tab completion to
automatically complete `oc` commands or suggest options when you press Tab.

.Prerequisites

* You must have the `oc` CLI tool installed.
* You must have the package `bash-completion` installed.

.Procedure

The following procedure enables tab completion for Bash.

. Save the Bash completion code to a file.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc completion bash > oc_bash_completion
----

. Copy the file to `/etc/bash_completion.d/`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo cp oc_bash_completion /etc/bash_completion.d/
----
+
You can also save the file to a local directory and source it from your
`.bashrc` file instead.

Tab completion is enabled when you open a new terminal.
