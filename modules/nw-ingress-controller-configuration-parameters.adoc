= Ingress controller configuration parameters

The `ingresscontrollers.operator.openshift.io` resource offers the following
configuration parameters.

[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|`domain`
|`domain` is a DNS name serviced by the Ingress controller and is used to configure multiple features:

* For the `LoadBalancerService` endpoint publishing strategy, `domain` is used to configure DNS records. See `endpointPublishingStrategy`.

* When using a generated default certificate, the certificate is valid for `domain` and its `subdomains`. See `defaultCertificate`.

* The value is published to individual Route statuses so that users know where to target external DNS records.

The `domain` value must be unique among all Ingress controllers and cannot be updated.

If empty, the default value is `ingress.config.openshift.io/cluster` `.spec.domain`.

|`replicas`
|`replicas` is the desired number of Ingress controller replicas. If not set, the default value is `2`.

|`endpointPublishingStrategy`
|`endpointPublishingStrategy` is used to publish the Ingress controller endpoints to other networks, enable load balancer integrations, and provide access to other systems.

If not set, the default value is based on `infrastructure.config.openshift.io/cluster` `.status.platform`:

* AWS: `LoadBalancerService` (with external scope)
* Azure: `LoadBalancerService` (with external scope)
* GCP: `LoadBalancerService` (with external scope)
* Bare metal: `NodePortService`
* Other: `HostNetwork`

The `endpointPublishingStrategy` value cannot be updated.

|`defaultCertificate`
|The `defaultCertificate` value is a reference to a secret that contains the default certificate that is served by the Ingress controller. When Routes do not specify their own certificate, `defaultCertificate` is used.

The secret must contain the following keys and data:
* `tls.crt`: certificate file contents
* `tls.key`: key file contents

If not set, a wildcard certificate is automatically generated and used. The certificate is valid for the Ingress controller `domain` and `subdomains`, and
the generated certificate's CA is automatically integrated with the
cluster's trust store.

The in-use certificate, whether generated or user-specified, is automatically integrated with {product-title} built-in OAuth server.

|`namespaceSelector`
|`namespaceSelector` is used to filter the set of namespaces serviced by the
Ingress controller. This is useful for implementing shards.

|`routeSelector`
|`routeSelector` is used to filter the set of Routes serviced by the Ingress controller. This is useful for implementing shards.

|`nodePlacement`
|`nodePlacement` enables explicit control over the scheduling of the Ingress controller.

If not set, the defaults values are used.

[NOTE]
====
The `nodePlacement` parameter includes two parts, `nodeSelector` and `tolerations`. For example:

----
nodePlacement:
 nodeSelector:
   matchLabels:
     beta.kubernetes.io/os: linux
 tolerations:
 - effect: NoSchedule
   operator: Exists
----
====

|`tlsSecurityProfile`
|`tlsSecurityProfile` specifies settings for TLS connections for Ingress controllers.

If not set, the default value is based on the `apiservers.config.openshift.io/cluster` resource.

When using the `Old`, `Intermediate`, and `Modern` profile types, the effective profile configuration is subject to change between releases. For example, given a specification to use the `Intermediate` profile deployed on release `X.Y.Z`, an upgrade to release `X.Y.Z+1` may cause a new profile configuration to be applied to the Ingress controller, resulting in a rollout.

The minimum TLS version for Ingress controllers is `1.1`, and the maximum TLS version is `1.2`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The HAProxy Ingress controller image does not support TLS `1.3` and because the `Modern` profile requires TLS `1.3`, it is not supported. The Ingress Operator converts the `Modern` profile to `Intermediate`.

The Ingress Operator also converts the TLS `1.0` of an `Old` or `Custom` profile to `1.1`, and TLS `1.3` of a `Custom` profile to `1.2`.
====

[NOTE]
====
Ciphers and the minimum TLS version of the configured security profile are reflected in the `TLSProfile` status.
====

|`routeAdmission`
|`routeAdmission` defines a policy for handling new route claims, such as allowing or denying claims across namespaces.

`namespaceOwnership` describes how host name claims across namespaces should be handled. The default is `Strict`.

* `Strict`: does not allow routes to claim the same host name across namespaces.
* `InterNamespaceAllowed`: allows routes to claim different paths of the same host name across namespaces.
