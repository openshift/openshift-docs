= Ingress controller configuration parameters

The `ingresscontrollers.operator.openshift.io` resource offers the following
configuration parameters.

[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|`domain`
|`domain` is a DNS name serviced by the Ingress controller and is used to configure multiple features:

* For the `LoadBalancerService` endpoint publishing strategy, `domain` is used to configure DNS records. See `endpointPublishingStrategy`.

* When using a generated default certificate, the certificate is valid for `domain` and its `subdomains`. See `defaultCertificate`.

* The value is published to individual Route statuses so that users know where to target external DNS records.

The `domain` value must be unique among all Ingress controllers and cannot be updated.

If empty, the default value is `ingress.config.openshift.io/cluster` `.spec.domain`.

|`replicas`
|`replicas` is the desired number of Ingress controller replicas. If not set, the default value is `2`.

|`endpointPublishingStrategy`
|`endpointPublishingStrategy` is used to publish the Ingress controller endpoints to other networks, enable load balancer integrations, and provide access to other systems.

If not set, the default value is based on `infrastructure.config.openshift.io/cluster` `.status.platform`:

* AWS: `LoadBalancerService` (with external scope)
* Azure: `LoadBalancerService` (with external scope)
* GCP: `LoadBalancerService` (with external scope)
* Bare metal: `NodePortService`
* Other: `HostNetwork`

The `endpointPublishingStrategy` value cannot be updated.

|`defaultCertificate`
|The `defaultCertificate` value is a reference to a secret that contains the default certificate that is served by the Ingress controller. When Routes do not specify their own certificate, `defaultCertificate` is used.

The secret must contain the following keys and data:
* `tls.crt`: certificate file contents
* `tls.key`: key file contents

If not set, a wildcard certificate is automatically generated and used. The certificate is valid for the Ingress controller `domain` and `subdomains`, and
the generated certificate's CA is automatically integrated with the
cluster's trust store.

The in-use certificate, whether generated or user-specified, is automatically integrated with {product-title} built-in OAuth server.

|`namespaceSelector`
|`namespaceSelector` is used to filter the set of namespaces serviced by the
Ingress controller. This is useful for implementing shards.

|`routeSelector`
|`routeSelector` is used to filter the set of Routes serviced by the Ingress controller. This is useful for implementing shards.

|`nodePlacement`
|`nodePlacement` enables explicit control over the scheduling of the Ingress controller.

If not set, the defaults values are used.

[NOTE]
====
The `nodePlacement` parameter includes two parts, `nodeSelector` and `tolerations`. For example:

----
nodePlacement:
 nodeSelector:
   matchLabels:
     beta.kubernetes.io/os: linux
 tolerations:
 - effect: NoSchedule
   operator: Exists
----
====

|`tlsSecurityProfile`
|`tlsSecurityProfile` specifies settings for TLS connections for Ingress controllers.

If not set, the default value is based on the `apiservers.config.openshift.io/cluster` resource.

When using the `Old`, `Intermediate`, and `Modern` profile types, the effective profile configuration is subject to change between releases. For example, given a specification to use the `Intermediate` profile deployed on release `X.Y.Z`, an upgrade to release `X.Y.Z+1` may cause a new profile configuration to be applied to the Ingress controller, resulting in a rollout.

The minimum TLS version for Ingress controllers is `1.1`, and the maximum TLS version is `1.2`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The HAProxy Ingress controller image does not support TLS `1.3` and because the `Modern` profile requires TLS `1.3`, it is not supported. The Ingress Operator converts the `Modern` profile to `Intermediate`.

The Ingress Operator also converts the TLS `1.0` of an `Old` or `Custom` profile to `1.1`, and TLS `1.3` of a `Custom` profile to `1.2`.
====

[NOTE]
====
Ciphers and the minimum TLS version of the configured security profile are reflected in the `TLSProfile` status.
====

|`routeAdmission`
|`routeAdmission` defines a policy for handling new route claims, such as allowing or denying claims across namespaces.

`namespaceOwnership` describes how host name claims across namespaces should be handled. The default is `Strict`.

* `Strict`: does not allow routes to claim the same host name across namespaces.
* `InterNamespaceAllowed`: allows routes to claim different paths of the same host name across namespaces.

`wildcardPolicy` describes how routes with wildcard policies are handled by the Ingress Controller.

* `WildcardsAllowed`: Indicates routes with any wildcard policy are admitted by the Ingress Controller.

* `WildcardsDisallowed`: Indicates only routes with a wildcard policy of `None` are admitted by the Ingress Controller. Updating `wildcardPolicy` from `WildcardsAllowed` to `WildcardsDisallowed` causes admitted routes with a wildcard policy of `Subdomain` to stop working. These routes must be recreated to a wildcard policy of `None` to be readmitted by the Ingress Controller. `WildcardsDisallowed` is the default setting.

|`IngressControllerLogging`
|`logging` defines parameters for what is logged where. If this field is empty, operational logs are enabled but access logs are disabled.

* `access` describes how client requests are logged. If this field is empty, access logging is disabled.
** `destination` describes a destination for log messages.
*** `type` is the type of destination for logs:
**** `Container` specifies that logs should go to a sidecar container. The Ingress Operator configures the container, named *logs*, on the Ingress Controller Pod and configures the Ingress Controller to write logs to the container. The expectation is that the administrator configures a custom logging solution that reads logs from this container. Using container logs means that logs may be dropped if the rate of logs exceeds the container runtime capacity or the custom logging solution capacity.
**** `Syslog` specifies that logs are sent to a Syslog endpoint. The administrator must specify an endpoint that can receive Syslog messages. The expectation is that the administrator has configured a custom Syslog instance.
*** `container` describes parameters for the `Container` logging destination type. Currently there are no parameters for container logging, so this field must be empty.
*** `syslog` describes parameters for the `Syslog` logging destination type:
**** `address` is the IP address of the syslog endpoint that receives log messages.
**** `port` is the UDP port number of the syslog endpoint that receives log messages.
**** `facility` specifies the syslog facility of log messages. If this field is empty, the facility is `local1`. Otherwise, it must specify a valid syslog facility: `kern`, `user`, `mail`, `daemon`, `auth`, `syslog`, `lpr`, `news`, `uucp`, `cron`, `auth2`, `ftp`, `ntp`, `audit`, `alert`, `cron2`, `local0`, `local1`, `local2`, `local3`. `local4`, `local5`, `local6`, or `local7`.
** `httpLogFormat` specifies the format of the log message for an HTTP request. If this field is empty, log messages use the implementation's default HTTP log format. For HAProxy's default HTTP log format, see link:http://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/2.0/configuration.html#8.2.3[the HAProxy documentation].

|`httpHeaders`
|`httpHeaders` defines the policy for HTTP headers.

By setting the `forwardedHeaderPolicy` for the `IngressControllerHTTPHeaders`, you specify when and how the Ingress controller sets the `Forwarded`, `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-Port`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, and `X-Forwarded-Proto-Version` HTTP headers.

By default, the policy is set to `Append`.

* `Append` specifies that the Ingress Controller appends the headers, preserving any existing headers.
* `Replace` specifies that the Ingress Controller sets the headers, removing any existing headers.
* `IfNone` specifies that the Ingress Controller sets the headers if they are not already set.
* `Never` specifies that the Ingress Controller never sets the headers, preserving any existing headers.
