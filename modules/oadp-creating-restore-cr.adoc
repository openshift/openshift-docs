= Creating a Restore CR

You restore a `Backup` custom resource (CR) by creating a `Restore` CR.

.Prerequisites

* You must install the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator.
* The `DataProtectionApplication` CR must be in a `Ready` state.
* You must have a Velero `Backup` CR.
* Adjust the requested size so the persistent volume (PV) capacity matches the requested size at backup time.

.Procedure

. Create a `Restore` CR, as in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: <restore>
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  backupName: <backup> <1>
  includedResources: [] <2>
  excludedResources:
  - nodes
  - events
  - events.events.k8s.io
  - backups.velero.io
  - restores.velero.io
  - resticrepositories.velero.io
  restorePVs: true
----
<1> Name of the `Backup` CR.
<2> Optional. Specify an array of resources to include in the restore process. Resources might be shortcuts (for example, 'po' for 'pods') or fully-qualified. If unspecified, all resources are included.

. Verify that the status of the `Restore` CR is `Completed` by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get restore -n openshift-adp <restore> -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}'
----

. Verify that the backup resources have been restored by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get all -n <namespace> <1>
----
<1> Namespace that you backed up.
