= Configuring image settings

You can configure image registry settings by editing the
`image.config.openshift.io/cluster`  custom resource (CR). The
Machine Config Operator (MCO) watches the
`image.config.openshift.io/cluster` CR for any changes 
to the registries and reboots the nodes when it detects changes.

.Procedure

. Edit the `image.config.openshift.io/cluster` custom resource:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit image.config.openshift.io/cluster
----

The following is an example `image.config.openshift.io/cluster` CR:

<1> `Image`: Holds cluster-wide information about how to handle images. The
canonical, and only valid name is `cluster`.
<2> `allowedRegistriesForImport`: Limits the container image registries from which
normal users may import images. Set this list to the registries that you trust
to contain valid images, and that you want applications to be able to
import from. Users with permission to create images or `ImageStreamMappings`
from the API are not affected by this policy. Typically only cluster
administrators will have the appropriate permissions.
<3> `additionalTrustedCA`: A reference to a ConfigMap containing additional CAs that
should be trusted during `ImageStream import`, `pod image pull`,
`openshift-image-registry pullthrough`, and builds. The namespace for this ConfigMap is
`openshift-config`. The format of the ConfigMap is to use the registry hostname
as the key, and the PEM certificate as the value, for each additional registry CA to
trust.
<4> `registrySources`: Contains configuration that determines how the container
runtime should treat individual registries when accessing images for builds and
pods. For instance, whether or not to allow insecure access. It does not contain
configuration for the internal cluster registry. This example lists `allowedRegistries`, 
which defines the registries that are allowed to be used. One of the registries listed
is insecure. 

. To check that the changes are applied, list your nodes:
