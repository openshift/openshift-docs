= Deleting a project using the CLI

When you delete a project, the server updates the project status to
*Terminating* from *Active*. Then, the server clears all content from a project
that is in the *Terminating* state before finally removing the project. While a
project is in *Terminating* status, you cannot add new content to the project.
Projects can be deleted from the CLI or the web console.
