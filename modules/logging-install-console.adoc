.Prerequisites



.Procedure

. Install the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator:

.. In the {product-title} web console, click *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.

.. Choose  *Red Hat OpenShift Logging* from the list of available Operators, and click *Install*.

.. Ensure that the *A specific namespace on the cluster* is selected under *Installation Mode*.

.. Ensure that *Operator recommended namespace* is *openshift-logging* under *Installed Namespace*.

.. Select *Enable operator recommended cluster monitoring on this namespace*.
+
This option sets the `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"` label in the Namespace object.
You must select this option to ensure that cluster monitoring
scrapes the `openshift-logging` namespace.

.. Select *stable*, or *stable-X* as the *Update Channel*.

.. Select an *Approval Strategy*.
+
* The *Automatic* strategy allows Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to automatically update the Operator when a new version is available.
+
* The *Manual* strategy requires a user with appropriate credentials to approve the Operator update.

.. Click *Install*.

.. Verify that the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator installed by switching to the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page.

.. Ensure that *Red Hat OpenShift Logging* is listed in the *openshift-logging* project with a *Status* of *Succeeded*.
+
If the Operator does not appear as installed, to troubleshoot further:
+
* Switch to the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page and inspect
the *Status* column for any errors or failures.
* Switch to the *Workloads* → *Pods* page and check the logs in any pods in the
`openshift-logging` project that are reporting issues.

. Create an OpenShift Logging instance:

.. Switch to the *Administration* -> *Custom Resource Definitions* page.

.. On the *Custom Resource Definitions* page, click *ClusterLogging*.

.. On the *Custom Resource Definition details* page, select *View Instances* from the *Actions* menu.

.. On the *ClusterLoggings* page, click *Create ClusterLogging*.
+
You might have to refresh the page to load the data.

.. In the YAML field, replace the code with the following:
