= Configuring vulnerability exception expiration periods

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure the time periods available for vulnerability management exceptions. These options are available when users request to defer a CVE.

.Prerequisites
* You have `write` permission for the `VulnerabilityManagementRequests` resource.

.Procedure
. In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Platform Configuration* -> *Exception Configuration*.
. You can configure expiration times that users can select when they request to defer a CVE. Enabling a time period makes it available to users and disabling it removes it from the user interface.
