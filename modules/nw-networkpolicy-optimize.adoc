= Optimizations for network policy with OpenShift SDN

Use a network policy to isolate pods that are differentiated from one another by labels within a namespace.

It is inefficient to apply `NetworkPolicy` objects to large numbers of individual pods in a single namespace. Pod labels do not exist at the IP address level, so a network policy generates a separate Open vSwitch (OVS) flow rule for every possible link between every pod selected with a `podSelector`.

For example, if the spec `podSelector` and the ingress `podSelector` within a `NetworkPolicy` object each match 200 pods, then 40,000 (200*200) OVS flow rules are generated. This might slow down a node.

When designing your network policy, refer to the following guidelines:

* Reduce the number of OVS flow rules by using namespaces to contain groups of pods that need to be isolated.
+
`NetworkPolicy` objects that select a whole namespace, by using the `namespaceSelector` or an empty `podSelector`, generate only a single OVS flow rule that matches the VXLAN virtual network ID (VNID) of the namespace.

* Keep the pods that do not need to be isolated in their original namespace, and move the pods that require isolation into one or more different namespaces.

* Create additional targeted cross-namespace network policies to allow the specific traffic that you do want to allow from the isolated pods.
