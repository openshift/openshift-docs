= Understanding your Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

There are two types of Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that your Operator may
use: ones that are _owned_ by it and ones that it depends on, which are
_required_.

[id="osdk-crds-owned_{context}"]
== Owned CRDs

The CRDs owned by your Operator are the most important part of your CSV. This
establishes the link between your Operator and the required RBAC rules,
dependency management, and other Kubernetes concepts.

It is common for your Operator to use multiple CRDs to link together concepts,
such as top-level database configuration in one object and a representation of
ReplicaSets in another. Each one should be listed out in the CSV file.

.Owned CRD fields
[cols="2a,5a,2",options="header"]
|===
|Field |Description |Required/Optional

|`Name`
|The full name of your CRD.
|Required

|`Version`
|The version of that object API.
|Required

|`Kind`
|The machine readable name of your CRD.
|Required

|`DisplayName`
|A human readable version of your CRD name, for example `MongoDB Standalone`.
|Required

|`Description`
|A short description of how this CRD is used by the Operator or a description of
the functionality provided by the CRD.
|Required

|`Group`
|The API group that this CRD belongs to, for example `database.example.com`.
|Optional

|`Resources`
a|Your CRDs own one or more types of Kubernetes objects. These are listed in the resources section to inform your users of the objects they might need to troubleshoot or how to connect to the application, such as the Service or Ingress rule that exposes a database.

It is recommended to only list out the objects that are important to a human,
not an exhaustive list of everything you orchestrate. For example, ConfigMaps
that store internal state that should not be modified by a user should not
appear here.
|Optional

|`SpecDescriptors`, `StatusDescriptors`, and `ActionDescriptors`
a|These Descriptors are a way to hint UIs with certain inputs or outputs of your
Operator that are most important to an end user. If your CRD contains the name
of a Secret or ConfigMap that the user must provide, you can specify that here.
These items are linked and highlighted in compatible UIs.

There are three types of descriptors:

* `SpecDescriptors`: A reference to fields in the `spec` block of an object.
* `StatusDescriptors`: A reference to fields in the `status` block of an object.
* `ActionDescriptors`: A reference to actions that can be performed on an object.

All Descriptors accept the following fields:

* `DisplayName`: A human readable name for the Spec, Status, or Action.
* `Description`: A short description of the Spec, Status, or Action and how it is
used by the Operator.
* `Path`: A dot-delimited path of the field on the object that this descriptor describes.
* `X-Descriptors`: Used to determine which "capabilities" this descriptor has and
which UI component to use. See the *openshift/console* project for a canonical
link:https://github.com/openshift/console/blob/master/frontend/public/components/operator-lifecycle-manager/descriptors/types.ts#L5-L26[list of React UI X-Descriptors] for {product-title}.

Also see the *openshift/console* project for more information on

in general.
|Optional

The following example depicts a `MongoDB Standalone` CRD that requires some user
input in the form of a Secret and ConfigMap, and orchestrates Services,
StatefulSets, Pods and ConfigMaps:

[id="osdk-crds-required_{context}"]
== Required CRDs

Relying on other required CRDs is completely optional and only exists to reduce
the scope of individual Operators and provide a way to compose multiple
Operators together to solve an end-to-end use case.

An example of this is an Operator that might set up an application and install
an etcd cluster (from an etcd Operator) to use for distributed locking and a
Postgres database (from a Postgres Operator) for data storage.

The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) checks against the available CRDs and
Operators in the cluster to fulfill these requirements. If suitable versions are
found, the Operators are started within the desired namespace and a Service
Account created for each Operator to create, watch, and modify the Kubernetes
resources required.

[id="osdk-crds-templates_{context}"]
== CRD templates

Users of your Operator will need to be aware of which options are required
versus optional. You can provide templates for each of your CRDs with a minimum
set of configuration as an annotation named `alm-examples`. Compatible UIs will
pre-fill this template for users to further customize.

The annotation consists of a list of the `kind`, for example, the CRD name and
the corresponding `metadata` and `spec` of the Kubernetes object.

The following full example provides templates for `EtcdCluster`, `EtcdBackup`
and `EtcdRestore`:

[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    alm-examples: >-
      [{"apiVersion":"etcd.database.coreos.com/v1beta2","kind":"EtcdCluster","metadata":{"name":"example","namespace":"default"},"spec":{"size":3,"version":"3.2.13"}},{"apiVersion":"etcd.database.coreos.com/v1beta2","kind":"EtcdRestore","metadata":{"name":"example-etcd-cluster"},"spec":{"etcdCluster":{"name":"example-etcd-cluster"},"backupStorageType":"S3","s3":{"path":"<full-s3-path>","awsSecret":"<aws-secret>"}}},{"apiVersion":"etcd.database.coreos.com/v1beta2","kind":"EtcdBackup","metadata":{"name":"example-etcd-cluster-backup"},"spec":{"etcdEndpoints":["<etcd-cluster-endpoints>"],"storageType":"S3","s3":{"path":"<full-s3-path>","awsSecret":"<aws-secret>"}}}]
