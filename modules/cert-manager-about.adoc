= About the {cert-manager-operator}

The link:https://cert-manager.io/[cert-manager] project introduces certificate authorities and certificates as resource types in the Kubernetes API, which makes it possible to provide certificates on demand to developers working within your cluster. The {cert-manager-operator} provides a supported way to integrate cert-manager into your {product-title} cluster.

The {cert-manager-operator} provides the following features:

* Support for integrating with external certificate authorities
* Tools to manage certificates
* Ability for developers to self-serve certificates
* Automatic certificate renewal

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not attempt to use more than one cert-manager Operator in your cluster. If you have a community cert-manager Operator installed in your cluster, you must uninstall it before installing the {cert-manager-operator}.
