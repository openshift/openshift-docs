== Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.11.2-322 release notes

This release of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.11.2-322 provides security updates and bug fixes for running the Operator in an {product-title} cluster. The following advisory is available for the link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:6144[RHSA-2023:6144].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before installing this version of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator, remove any previously installed Technology Preview versions or the community-supported version of KEDA.
====

Bug fixes::

* Because the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator version 3.11.2-311 was released without a required volume mount in the Operator deployment, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator pod would restart every 15 minutes. This fix adds the required volume mount to the Operator deployment. As a result, the Operator no longer restarts every 15 minutes.  (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-22361[OCPBUGS-22361])

== Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.11.2-311 release notes

This release of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.11.2-311 provides new features and bug fixes for running the Operator in an {product-title} cluster. The components of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.11.2-311 were released in link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2023:5981[RHBA-2023:5981].

[IMPORTANT]

Before installing this version of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator, remove any previously installed Technology Preview versions or the community-supported version of KEDA.

New features and enhancements::

Note the new features and enhancements in this release:

* Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS and OpenShift Dedicated are now supported
+
The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.11.2-311 can be installed on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS and OpenShift Dedicated managed clusters. Previous versions of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator could be installed only in the `openshift-keda` namespace. This prevented the Operator from being installed on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS and OpenShift Dedicated clusters. This version of Custom Metrics Autoscaler allows installation to other namespaces such as `openshift-operators` or `keda`, enabling installation into Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS and OpenShift Dedicated clusters.

Bug fixes::

* Previously, if the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator was installed and configured, but not in use, the OpenShift CLI reported the `couldn't get resource list for external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1: Got empty response for: external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1` error after any `oc` command was entered. The message, although harmless, could have caused confusion. With this fix, the `Got empty response for: external.metrics...` error no longer appears inappropriately. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-15779[OCPBUGS-15779])

* Previously, any annotation or label change to objects managed by the Custom Metrics Autoscaler were reverted by Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator any time the Keda Controller was modified, for example after a configuration change. This caused continuous changing of labels in your objects. The Custom Metrics Autoscaler now uses its own annotation to manage labels and annotations, and annotation or label are no longer inappropriately reverted. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-15590[OCPBUGS-15590])
