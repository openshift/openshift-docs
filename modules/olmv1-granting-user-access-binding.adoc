= Granting user access to extension resources by using custom role bindings

As a cluster administrator, you can manually create and configure role-based access control (RBAC) policies to grant user access to extension resources by using custom role bindings.

.Prerequisites

* A cluster extension has been installed on your cluster.
* You have a list of API groups and resource names, as described in "Finding API groups and resources exposed by a cluster extension".

.Procedure

. If the installed cluster extension does not provide default cluster roles, manually create one or more roles:

.. Consider the use cases for the set of roles described in "Common default cluster roles for users".
+
For example, create one or more of the following `ClusterRole` object definitions, replacing `<cluster_extension_api_group>` and `<cluster_extension_custom_resource>` with the actual API group and resource names provided by the installed cluster extension:
+

<1> Setting a wildcard (`*`) in `verbs` allows all actions on the specified resources.

.. Create the cluster roles by running the following command for any YAML files you created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <filename>.yaml
----

. Associate a cluster role to specific users or groups to grant them the necessary permissions for the resource by binding the cluster roles to individual user or group names:

.. Create an object definition for either a _cluster role binding_ to grant access across all namespaces or a _role binding_ to grant access within a specific namespace:
