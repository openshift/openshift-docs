= Viewing workload CVEs in Vulnerability Management (2.0)

[role="_abstract"]
You can view a comprehensive list of vulnerabilities, or CVEs, in {product-title-short} across images and deployments. You can use the search filter bar to select specific CVEs, images, deployments, namespaces, or clusters.

.Procedure
. In the {product-title-short} portal, navigate to *Vulnerability Management (2.0)* -> *Workload CVEs*.
. From the drop-down list, select the search criteria you want to use. You can select an item type, such as a cluster, from the list, and then select the specific name of the item. You can add additional items to the filter by selecting another item from the list and selecting the specific name of the new item. For example, you can select a specific image and a specific cluster to limit results to those selections. You can filter on the following items:
* CVE
* Image
* Deployment
* Namespace
* Cluster
. Optional: Use the *CVE severity* list to select the severities of the CVEs that you want to display.
. Click the relevant button to view a list of vulnerabilities, images, or deployments in the system.
