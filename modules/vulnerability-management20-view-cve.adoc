= Viewing workload CVEs

[role="_abstract"]

The *Vulnerability Management* -> *Workload CVEs* page provides information about vulnerabilities in applications running on clusters in your system. You can view vulnerability information across images and deployments. The *Workload CVEs* page provides more advanced filtering capabilities than the dashboard, including the ability to view images and deployments with vulnerabilities and filter by image, deployment, namespace, cluster, CVE, component, and component source.

.Procedure

. To show all CVEs across all images, select *Image vulnerabilities* from the *View image vulnerabilities* list.
. From the *View image vulnerabilities* list, select how you want to view the images. The following options are provided:
* *Image vulnerabilities*: Displays images and deployments in which {product-title-short} has discovered CVEs.
* *Images without vulnerabilities*: Displays images that meet at least one of the following conditions:
** Images that do not have CVEs
** Images that report a scanner error that may result in a false negative of no CVEs
+
[NOTE]
====
An image that actually contains vulnerabilities can appear in this list inadvertently. For example, if Scanner was able to scan the image and it is known to {product-title-short}, but the scan was not successfully completed, vulnerabilities cannot be detected. This scenario occurs if an image has an operating system that is not supported by the {product-title-short} scanner. Scan errors are displayed when you hover over an image in the image list or click the image name for more information.
====
. To filter CVEs by entity, select the appropriate filters and attributes.
+
To select multiple entities and attributes, click the right arrow icon to add another criteria. Depending on your choices, enter the appropriate information such as text, or select a date or object.
+
The filter entities and attributes are listed in the following table.

[cols="2",options="header"]
|===
|Entity|Attributes

|Image
a|
* *Name*: The name of the image.
* *Operating system*: The operating system of the image.
* *Tag*: The tag for the image.
* *Label*: The label for the image.
* *Registry*: The registry where the image is located.
|CVE
a|
* *Name*: The name of the CVE.
* *Discovered time*: The date when {product-title-short} discovered the CVE.
* *CVSS*: The severity level for the CVE.
+
The following values are associated with the severity level for the CVE:
+
** *is greater than*
** *is greater than or equal to*
** *is equal to*
** *is less than or equal to*
** *is less than*
* *NVD CVSS*: The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) provides a CVSS score between `0` to `10` for a CVE based on the severity of the vulnerability.
+
For more information, see link:https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss[Vulnerability Metrics].
|Image Component
a|

* *Name*: The name of the image component, for example, `activerecord-sql-server-adapter`
* *Source*:
** OS
** Python
** Java
** Ruby
** Node.js
** Go
** Dotnet Core Runtime
** Infrastructure

* *Version*: Version of the image component; for example, `3.4.21`. You can use this to search for a specific version of a component, for example, in conjunction with a component name.
|Deployment
a|
* *Name*: Name of the deployment.
* *Label*: Label for the deployment.
* *Annotation*: The annotation for the deployment.
|Namespace
a|
* *Name*: The name of the namespace.
* *Label*: The label for the namespace.
* *Annotation*: The annotation for the namespace.
|Cluster
a|
* *Name*: The name of the cluster.
* *Label*: The label for the cluster.
* *Type*: The cluster type, for example, OCP.
* *Platform type*: The platform type, for example, OpenShift 4 cluster.
|===
. You can select the following options to refine the list of results:
* *Prioritize by namespace view*: Displays a list of namespaces sorted according to the risk priority. You can use this view to quickly identify and address the most critical areas. In this view, click *<number> deployments* in a table row to return to the workload CVE list view, with filters applied to show only deployments, images and CVEs for the selected namespace.
* *Default filters*: You can select filters for CVE severity and CVE status that are automatically applied when you visit the *Workload CVEs* page. These filters only apply to this page, and are applied when you visit the page from another section of the {product-title-short} web portal or from a bookmarked URL. They are saved in the local storage of your browser.
* *CVE severity*: You can select one or more levels.
* *CVE status*: You can select *Fixable* or *Not fixable*.

[NOTE]
====
The *Filtered view* icon indicates that the displayed results were filtered based on the criteria that you selected. You can click *Clear filters* to remove all filters, or remove individual filters by clicking on them.
====

In the list of results, click a CVE, image name, or deployment name to view more information about the item. For example, depending on the item type, you can view the following information:

* Whether a CVE is fixable
* Whether an image is active
* The Dockerfile line in the image that contains the CVE
* External links to information about the CVE in Red{nbsp}Hat and other CVE databases

.Search example

The following graphic shows an example of search criteria for a cluster called `staging-secured-cluster` to view CVEs of critical and important severity with a fixable status in that cluster.
