= OpenShift Lightspeed 1.0.6 fixed issues

{ols-official} 1.0.6 fixes the following issues:

* Before this update, the *lightspeed-app-server* pod used the default SSL certificate bundle instead of the specified one. As a consequence, end users experienced unsecured data transmission due to incorrect SSL certificate usage. With this release, the *lightspeed-app-server* now uses the specified SSL certificate file. As a result, the *lightspeed-app-server* pod uses the correct SSL certificate, ensuring secure data transmission for end users. https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OLS-2112[OLS-2112]

* Before this update, an invalid model reference in `OLSConfig` caused the OpenShift Lightspeed installation to fail. With this release, the `OLSConfig` health check has been fixed to check for the existence of the model before use, providing error details in the console. As a result, the server performs better health checks, providing more accurate status information to the console, improving the user's experience. https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OLS-1949[OLS-1949]
