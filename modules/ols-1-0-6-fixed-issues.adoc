{ols-official} 1.0.6 fixes the following issues:

* Before this update, when the {ols-long} Service was connecting to {azure-openai} using an additional TLS certificate, the Service  was not able to successfully connect to the large language model (LLM). Now, the Service adds the TLS certificate to the trust bundle. As a result, the Service connects to the LLM. https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OLS-2112[OLS-2112]

* Before this update when you disabled transcript and feedback collection, the {ols-long} Service failed to deploy the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. Now, when you disable transcript and feedback collection, the Service deploys the MCP server. https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OLS-2113[OLS-2113]
