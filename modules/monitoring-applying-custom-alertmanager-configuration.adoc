= Applying custom Alertmanager configuration

This procedure shows how to override the default Alertmanager configuration with your own.

.Procedure

* Put the new configuration into the Ansible variable `openshift_cluster_monitoring_operator_alertmanager_config` from the `openshift_cluster_monitoring_operator` role.
+
For example, the following listing configures PagerDuty for notifications.
+
----
openshift_cluster_monitoring_operator_alertmanager_config: |+
  global:
    resolve_timeout: 5m
  route:
    group_wait: 30s
    group_interval: 5m
    repeat_interval: 12h
    receiver: default
    routes:
    - match:
        alertname: DeadMansSwitch
      repeat_interval: 5m
      receiver: deadmansswitch
    - match:
        service: example-app
      routes:
      - match:
          severity: critical
        receiver: team-frontend-page
  receivers:
  - name: default
  - name: deadmansswitch
  - name: team-frontend-page
    pagerduty_configs:
    - service_key: "<key>"
----
+
The sub-route matches only on alerts that have a severity of `critical`, and sends them via the receiver called `team-frontend-page`. As the name indicates, someone should be paged for alerts that are critical.
