= Applying a custom Alertmanager configuration

You can overwrite the default Alertmanager configuration by editing the `alertmanager-main` secret in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace for the platform instance of Alertmanager.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.

.Procedure

To change the Alertmanager configuration from the CLI:

. Print the currently active Alertmanager configuration into file `alertmanager.yaml`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring get secret alertmanager-main --template='{{ index .data "alertmanager.yaml" }}' | base64 --decode > alertmanager.yaml
----
+
. Edit the configuration in `alertmanager.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
global:
  resolve_timeout: 5m
route:
  group_wait: 30s <1>
  group_interval: 5m <2>
  repeat_interval: 12h <3>
  receiver: default
  routes:
  - matchers:
    - "alertname=Watchdog"
    repeat_interval: 2m
    receiver: watchdog
  - matchers:
    - "service=<your_service>" <4>
    routes:
    - matchers:
      - <your_matching_rules> <5>
      receiver: <receiver> <6>
receivers:
- name: default
- name: watchdog
- name: <receiver>
#  <receiver_configuration>
----
<1> The `group_wait` value specifies how long Alertmanager waits before sending an initial notification for a group of alerts.
This value controls how long Alertmanager waits while collecting initial alerts for the same group before sending a notification.
<2> The `group_interval` value specifies how much time must elapse before Alertmanager sends a notification about new alerts added to a group of alerts for which an initial notification was already sent.
<3> The `repeat_interval` value specifies the minimum amount of time that must pass before an alert notification is repeated.
If you want a notification to repeat at each group interval, set the `repeat_interval` value to less than the `group_interval` value.
However, the repeated notification can still be delayed, for example, when certain Alertmanager pods are restarted or rescheduled.
<4> The `service` value specifies the service that fires the alerts.
<5> The `<your_matching_rules>` value specifies the target alerts.
<6> The `receiver` value specifies the receiver to use for the alert.
+
[NOTE]
====
Use the `matchers` key name to indicate the matchers that an alert has to fulfill to match the node.
Do not use the `match` or `match_re` key names, which are both deprecated and planned for removal in a future release.

In addition, if you define inhibition rules, use the `target_matchers` key name to indicate the target matchers and the `source_matchers` key name to indicate the source matchers.
Do not use the `target_match`, `target_match_re`, `source_match`, or `source_match_re` key names, which are deprecated and planned for removal in a future release.

The following Alertmanager configuration example configures PagerDuty as an alert receiver:
+
[source,yaml]
----
global:
  resolve_timeout: 5m
route:
  group_wait: 30s
  group_interval: 5m
  repeat_interval: 12h
  receiver: default
  routes:
  - matchers:
    - "alertname=Watchdog"
    repeat_interval: 2m
    receiver: watchdog
  - matchers:
    - "service=example-app"
    routes:
    - matchers:
      - "severity=critical"
      receiver: team-frontend-page*
receivers:
- name: default
- name: watchdog
- name: team-frontend-page
  pagerduty_configs:
  - service_key: "_your-key_"
----
+
With this configuration, alerts of `critical` severity that are fired by the `example-app` service are sent using the `team-frontend-page` receiver. Typically these types of alerts would be paged to an individual or a critical response team.
+
. Apply the new configuration in the file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring create secret generic alertmanager-main --from-file=alertmanager.yaml --dry-run=client -o=yaml |  oc -n openshift-monitoring replace secret --filename=-
----

To change the Alertmanager configuration from the {product-title} web console:

. Navigate to the *Administration* -> *Cluster Settings* -> *Configuration* -> *Alertmanager* -> *YAML* page of the web console.

. Modify the YAML configuration file.

. Select *Save*.
