= Scanning inactive images

{product-title} scans all active (deployed) images every 4 hours and updates the image scan results to reflect the latest vulnerability definitions.
//TODO: add link to Re-scanning images.

You can also configure {product-title} to scan inactive (not deployed) images automatically.
