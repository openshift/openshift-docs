= Scanning inactive images

{rh-rhacscs-first} scans all active (deployed) images every 4 hours and updates the image scan results to reflect the latest vulnerability definitions.
//TODO: add link to Re-scanning images.

You can also configure {product-title-short} to scan inactive (not deployed) images automatically.


.Procedure

. On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Vulnerability Management > Dashboard*.
. On the *Dashboard* view header, select *IMAGES*.
. Click *MANAGE WATCHES* to manage the scanning of watched images.
. In the *MANAGE WATCHED IMAGES* dialog, enter the inactive imageâ€™s name for which you want to enable scanning.
+
Verify that you enter the name of the image and not the image `id`.
Image name is the fully-qualified image name, beginning with the registry and ending with the tag. For example, `docker.io/vulnerables/cve-2017-7494:latest`.

. Select *ADD IMAGE*. RHACS then scans the image and shows the error or success message.
. (Optional) Click *REMOVE WATCH* to remove an image from the watchlist.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
On the {product-title-short} portal, click *Platform Configuration > System Configuration* to view the data retention configuration.

All the data related to the image removed from the watchlist continues to appear in the {product-title-short} portal for the number of days mentioned on the *System Configuration* page and is only removed after that period is over.
====
. Select *RETURN TO IMAGE LIST* to view the *IMAGES* page.
