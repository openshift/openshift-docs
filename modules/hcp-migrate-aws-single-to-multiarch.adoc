= Transitioning a hosted cluster from single-architecture to multi-architecture

You can transition your single-architecture 64-bit AMD hosted cluster to a multi-architecture hosted cluster on {aws-first}, to reduce the cost of running workloads on your cluster. For example, you can run existing workloads on 64-bit AMD while transitioning to 64-bit ARM and you can manage these workloads from a central Kubernetes cluster.

A single-architecture hosted cluster can manage node pools of only one particular CPU architecture. However, a multi-architecture hosted cluster can manage node pools with different CPU architectures. On {aws-short}, a multi-architecture hosted cluster can manage both 64-bit AMD and 64-bit ARM node pools.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed an {product-title} management cluster for {aws-short} on {rh-rhacm-first} with the {mce}.
* You have an existing single-architecture hosted cluster that uses 64-bit AMD variant of the {product-title} release payload.
* An existing node pool that uses the same 64-bit AMD variant of the {product-title} release payload and is managed by an existing hosted cluster.
* Ensure that you installed the following command-line tools:

** `oc`
** `kubectl`
** `hcp`
** `skopeo`

.Procedure

. Review an existing {product-title} release image of the single-architecture hosted cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get hostedcluster/<hosted_cluster_name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.release.image}' <1>
----
+
<1> Replace `<hosted_cluster_name>` with your hosted cluster name.
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:<4.y.z>-x86_64 <1>
----
<1> Replace `<4.y.z>` with the supported {product-title} version that you use.

. In your {product-title} release image, if you use the digest instead of a tag, find the multi-architecture tag version of your release image:

.. Set the `OCP_VERSION` environment variable for the {product-title} version by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ OCP_VERSION=$(oc image info quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@sha256:ac78ebf77f95ab8ff52847ecd22592b545415e1ff6c7ff7f66bf81f158ae4f5e -o jsonpath='{.config.config.Labels["io.openshift.release"]}')
----

.. Set the `MULTI_ARCH_TAG` environment variable for the multi-architecture tag version of your release image by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ MULTI_ARCH_TAG=$(skopeo inspect docker://quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@sha256:ac78ebf77f95ab8ff52847ecd22592b545415e1ff6c7ff7f66bf81f158ae4f5e | jq -r '.RepoTags' | sed 's/"//g' | sed 's/,//g' | grep -w "$OCP_VERSION-multi$" | xargs)
----

.. Set the `IMAGE` environment variable for the multi-architecture release image name by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ IMAGE=quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:$MULTI_ARCH_TAG
----

.. To see the list of multi-architecture image digests, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc image info $IMAGE
----
+

----

. Transition the hosted cluster from single-architecture to multi-architecture:

.. Set the multi-architecture {product-title} release image for the hosted cluster by ensuring that you use the same {product-title} version as the hosted cluster. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch -n clusters hostedclusters/<hosted_cluster_name> -p '{"spec":{"release":{"image":"quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:<4.x.y>-multi"}}}' --type=merge <1>
----
<1> Replace `<4.y.z>` with the supported {product-title} version that you use.

.. Confirm that the multi-architecture image is set in your hosted cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get hostedcluster/<hosted_cluster_name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.release.image}'
----

. Check that the status of the `HostedControlPlane` resource is `Progressing` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get hostedcontrolplane -n <hosted_control_plane_namespace> -oyaml
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----

$ oc get hostedcluster <hosted_cluster_name> -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> -oyaml
----

.Verification

* Verify that a node pool is using the multi-architecture release image in your `HostedControlPlane` resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get hostedcontrolplane -n clusters-example -oyaml

[NOTE]
====
The multi-architecture {product-title} release image is updated in your `HostedCluster`, `HostedControlPlane` resources, and hosted control plane pods. However, your existing node pools do not transition with the multi-architecture image automatically, because the release image transition is decoupled between the hosted cluster and node pools. You must create new node pools on your new multi-architecture hosted cluster.
