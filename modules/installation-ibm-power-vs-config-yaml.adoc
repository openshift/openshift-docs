= Sample customized install-config.yaml file for {ibm-power-server-title}

You can customize the `install-config.yaml` file to specify more details about your {product-title} cluster's platform or modify the values of the required parameters.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This sample YAML file is provided for reference only. You must obtain your `install-config.yaml` file by using the installation program and modify it.

<1> If you do not provide these parameters and values, the installation program provides the default value.
<2> The `controlPlane` section is a single mapping, but the compute section is a sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures, the first line of the `compute` section must begin with a hyphen, `-`, and the first line of the `controlPlane` section must not. Although both sections currently define a single machine pool, it is possible that {product-title} will support defining multiple compute pools during installation. Only one control plane pool is used.
<3> Whether to enable or disable simultaneous multithreading, or `hyperthreading`. By default, simultaneous multithreading is enabled to increase the performance of your machines' cores. You can disable it by setting the parameter value to `Disabled`. If you disable simultaneous multithreading in some cluster machines, you must disable it in all cluster machines.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you disable simultaneous multithreading, ensure that your capacity planning accounts for the dramatically decreased machine performance.
====
//ifndef::openshift-origin[]
//<5> Whether to enable or disable FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the {op-system-first} machines that {product-title} runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with {op-system} instead.
//+
//[IMPORTANT]
//====
//The use of FIPS Validated or Modules in Process cryptographic libraries is only supported on {product-title} deployments on the `x86_64` architecture.
//====
//<6> You can optionally provide the `sshKey` value that you use to access the machines in your cluster.
//endif::openshift-origin[]
<4> The smtLevel specifies the level of SMT to set to the control plane and compute machines. The supported values are 1, 2, 4, 8, `'off'` and `'on'`. The default value is 8. The smtLevel `'off'` sets SMT to off and smtlevel `'on'` sets SMT to the default value 8 on the cluster nodes.
+
[NOTE]
====
When simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or hyperthreading is not enabled, one vCPU is equivalent to one physical core. When enabled, total vCPUs is computed as: (Thread(s) per core * Core(s) per socket) * Socket(s). The smtLevel controls the threads per core. Lower SMT levels may require additional assigned cores when deploying the cluster nodes. You can do this by setting the `'processors'` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` file to an appropriate value to meet the requirements for deploying {product-title} successfully.
====
<5> The cluster network plugin to install. The default value `OVNKubernetes` is the only supported value.
<6> The name of an existing resource group.
<7> Required. The installation program prompts you for this value.

<8> Optional. You can optionally provide the `sshKey` value that you use to access the machines in your cluster.
endif::openshift-origin[]
+
[NOTE]
====
For production {product-title} clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your `ssh-agent` process uses.
