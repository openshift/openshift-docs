= Upgrading GitOps ZTP

You can upgrade the Gitops zero touch provisioning (ZTP) infrastructure independently from the underlying cluster, {rh-rhacm-first}, and OpenShift version running on the spoke clusters. This procedure guides you though the upgrade process to avoid impact on the spoke clusters, however any changes to the content or settings of policies, including adding recommended content results in changes that must be rolled out and reconciled to the spoke clusters.

This procedure assumes that you have a fully operational hub cluster running the earlier version of the GitOps ZTP infrastructure.

At a high level, the strategy for upgrading the GitOps ZTP infrastructure is:

. Label all existing clusters with the `ztp-done` label.
. Stop the ArgoCD applications.
. Install the new tooling.
. Update required content and optional changes in the Git repository.
. Update and restart the application configuration.
