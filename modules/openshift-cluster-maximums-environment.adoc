1. io1 disks with 3000 IOPS are used for master/etcd nodes as etcd is I/O intensive and latency sensitive.
2. Infra nodes are used to host Monitoring, Ingress, and Registry components to ensure they have enough resources to run at large scale.
3. Workload node is dedicated to run performance and scalability workload generators.
4. Larger disk size is used so that there is enough space to store the large amounts of data that is collected during the performance and scalability test run.
5. Cluster is scaled in iterations and performance and scalability tests are executed at the specified node counts.
