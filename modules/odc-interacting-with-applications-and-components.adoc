= Interacting with the application and the components

The *Topology* view in the *Developer* perspective of the web console provides the following options to interact with the application and the components:

* Click *Open URL* (image:odc_open_url.png[title="Application Link"]) to see your application exposed by the route on a public URL.
* Click *Edit Source code* to access your source code and modify it.

This feature is available only when you create applications using the *From Git*, *From Catalog*, and the *From Dockerfile* options.

* Hover your cursor over the lower left icon on the Pod to see the name of the latest build and its status. The status of the application build is indicated as *New* (image:odc_build_new.png[title="New Build"]), *Pending* (image:odc_build_pending.png[title="Pending Build"]), *Running* (image:odc_build_running.png[title="Running Build"]), *Completed* (image:odc_build_completed.png[title="Completed Build"]), *Failed* (image:odc_build_failed.png[title="Failed Build"]), and *Canceled* (image:odc_build_canceled.png[title="Canceled Build"]).
* Use the *Shortcuts* menu listed on the upper-right of the screen to navigate components in the *Topology* view.
* Use the *List View* icon to see a list of all your applications and use the *Topology View* icon to switch back to the *Topology* view.
