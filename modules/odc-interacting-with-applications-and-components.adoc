= Interacting with the application and the components

The *Topology* view in the *Developer* perspective of the web console provides the following options to interact with the application and the components:

* Click *Open URL* (image:odc_open_url.png[title="Application Link"]) to see your application exposed by the route on a public URL.
* Click *Edit Source code* to access your source code and modify it.
+
[NOTE]
====
This feature is available only when you create applications using the *From Git*, *From Catalog*, and the *From Dockerfile* options.

* Hover your cursor over the lower left icon on the Pod to see the name of the latest build and its status. The status of the application build is indicated as *New* (image:odc_build_new.png[title="New Build"]), *Pending* (image:odc_build_pending.png[title="Pending Build"]), *Running* (image:odc_build_running.png[title="Running Build"]), *Completed* (image:odc_build_completed.png[title="Completed Build"]), *Failed* (image:odc_build_failed.png[title="Failed Build"]), and *Canceled* (image:odc_build_canceled.png[title="Canceled Build"]).
* Use the *Shortcuts* menu listed on the upper-right of the screen to navigate components in the *Topology* view.
* Use the *List View* icon to see a list of all your applications and use the *Topology View* icon to switch back to the *Topology* view.
* Use the *Find by name* field to select the components with component names that match the query. Search results may appear outside of the visible area; click *Fit to Screen* from the lower-left toolbar to resize the *Topology* view to show all components.
* Use the *Display Options* drop-down list to configure the *Topology* view of the various application groupings. The options are available depending on the types of components deployed in the project:
** *Pod Count*: Select to show the number of pods of a component in the component icon.
** *Event Sources*: Toggle to show or hide the event sources.
** *Virtual Machines*: Toggle to show or hide the virtual machines.
** *Labels*: Toggle to show or hide the component labels.
** *Application Groupings*: Clear to condense the application groups into cards with an overview of an application group and alerts associated with it.
** *Helm Releases*: Clear to condense the components deployed as Helm Release into cards with an overview of a given release.
** *Knative Services*: Clear to condense the Knative Service components into cards with an overview of a given component.
** *Operator Groupings* Clear to condense the components deployed with an Operator into cards with an overview of the given group.

* The status or phase of the pod is indicated by different colors and tooltips as:
** *Running* (image:odc_pod_running.png[title="Pod Running"]): The pod is bound to a node and all of the containers are created. At least one container is still running or is in the process of starting or restarting.
** *Not Ready* (image:odc_pod_not_ready.png[title="Pod Not Ready"]): The pods which are running multiple containers, not all containers are ready.
** *Warning*(image:odc_pod_warning.png[title="Pod Warning"]): Containers in pods are being terminated, however termination did not succeed. Some containers may be other states.
** *Failed*(image:odc_pod_failed.png[title="Pod Failed"]): All containers in the pod terminated but least one container has terminated in failure. That is, the container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated by the system.
** *Pending*(image:odc_pod_pending.png[title="Pod Pending"]): The pod is accepted by the Kubernetes cluster, but one or more of the containers has not been set up and made ready to run. This includes time a pod spends waiting to be scheduled as well as the time spent downloading container images over the network.
** *Succeeded*(image:odc_pod_succeeded.png[title="Pod Succeeded"]): All containers in the pod terminated successfully and will not be restarted.
** *Terminating*(image:odc_pod_terminating.png[title="Pod Terminating"]): When a pod is being deleted, it is shown as *Terminating* by some kubectl commands. *Terminating* status is not one of the pod phases. A pod is granted a graceful termination period, which defaults to 30 seconds.
** *Unknown*(image:odc_pod_unknown.png[title="Pod Unknown"]): The state of the pod could not be obtained. This phase typically occurs due to an error in communicating with the node where the pod should be running.
