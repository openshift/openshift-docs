= Configuring the hub cluster to use unauthenticated registries

You can configure the hub cluster to use unauthenticated registries.
Unauthenticated registries does not require authentication to access and download images.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed and configured a hub cluster and installed {rh-rhacm-first} on the hub cluster.

* You have installed the OpenShift Container Platform CLI (oc).

* You have logged in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have configured an unauthenticated registry for use with the hub cluster.

.Procedure

. Update the `AgentServiceConfig` custom resource (CR) by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit AgentServiceConfig agent
----

. Add the `unauthenticatedRegistries` field in the CR:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: agent-install.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: AgentServiceConfig
metadata:
  name: agent
spec:
  unauthenticatedRegistries:
  - example.registry.com
  - example.registry2.com
  ...
----
+
Unauthenticated registries are listed under `spec.unauthenticatedRegistries` in the `AgentServiceConfig` resource.
Any registry on this list is not required to have an entry in the pull secret used for the spoke cluster installation.
`assisted-service` validates the pull secret by making sure it contains the authentication information for every image registry used for installation.

[NOTE]
====
Mirror registries are automatically added to the ignore list and do not need to be added under `spec.unauthenticatedRegistries`.
Specifying the `PUBLIC_CONTAINER_REGISTRIES` environment variable in the `ConfigMap` overrides the default values with the specified value.
The `PUBLIC_CONTAINER_REGISTRIES` defaults are https://quay.io[quay.io] and https://registry.svc.ci.openshift.org[registry.svc.ci.openshift.org].
====

.Verification

Verify that you can access the newly added registry from the hub cluster by running the following commands:

. Open a debug shell prompt to the hub cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc debug node/<node_name>
----

. Test access to the unauthenticated registry by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
sh-4.4# podman login -u kubeadmin -p $(oc whoami -t) <unauthenticated_registry>
----
+
where:
+
--
<unauthenticated_registry>:: Is the new registry, for example, `unauthenticated-image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000`.
