= Hot deploying

Hot deployment allows you to quickly make and deploy changes to your application without having to generate a new source-to-image (S2I) build. If you are using Django, hot deployment works out of the box.

To enable hot deployment while using Gunicorn, ensure you have a Gunicorn
configuration file inside your repository with https://gunicorn-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/settings.html#reload[the `reload` option set to `true`. Specify your configuration file using the `APP_CONFIG` environment variable. For example, see the `oc new-app` command. You can use the `oc set env` command to update environment variables of existing objects.

[WARNING]
====
You should only use this option while developing or debugging. It is not recommended to turn this on in your production environment.
