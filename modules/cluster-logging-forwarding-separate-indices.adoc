[id="cluster-logging-forwarding-separate-indices_{context}"]
= Forwarding JSON logs from containers in the same pod to separate indices

You can forward structured logs from different containers within the same pod to different indices. To use this feature, you must configure the pipeline with multi-container support and annotate the pods. Logs are written to indices with a prefix of `app-`. It is recommended that Elasticsearch be configured with aliases to accommodate this.

[IMPORTANT]
====
JSON formatting of logs varies by application. Because creating too many indices impacts performance, limit your use of this feature to creating indices for logs that have incompatible JSON formats. Use queries to separate logs from different namespaces, or applications with compatible JSON formats.

.Prerequisites

* {logging-title-uc}: 5.5

.Procedure
. Create or edit a YAML file that defines the `ClusterLogForwarder` CR object:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: logging.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterLogForwarder
metadata:
  name: instance
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  outputDefaults:
    elasticsearch:
      structuredTypeKey: kubernetes.labels.logFormat <1>
      structuredTypeName: nologformat
      enableStructuredContainerLogs: true <2>
  pipelines:
  - inputRefs:
    - application
    name: application-logs
    outputRefs:
    - default
    parse: json
----
<1> Uses the value of the key-value pair that is formed by the Kubernetes `logFormat` label.
<2> Enables multi-container outputs.

. Create or edit a YAML file that defines the `Pod` CR object:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
    containerType.logging.openshift.io/heavy: heavy <1>
    containerType.logging.openshift.io/low: low
spec:
  containers:
  - name: heavy <2>
    image: heavyimage
  - name: low
    image: lowimage
----
<1> Format: `containerType.logging.openshift.io/<container-name>: <index>`
<2> Annotation names must match container names

[WARNING]
====
This configuration might significantly increase the number of shards on the cluster.
