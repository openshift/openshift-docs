= Enabling stream-based retention with Loki
With Logging version 5.6 and higher, you can configure retention policies based on log streams. Rules for these may be set globally, per tenant, or both. If you configure both, tenant rules apply before global rules.

. To enable stream-based retention,  create or edit the `LokiStack` custom resource (CR):
+
include::snippets/logging-create-apply-cr-snip.adoc[lines=9..12]

. You can refer to the examples below to configure your LokiStack CR.
