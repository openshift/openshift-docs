= Analyzing DataVolumes using conditions and events

By inspecting the `Conditions` and `Events` sections generated by the `describe`
command, you determine the state of the DataVolume
in relation to PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs), and whether or
not an operation is actively running or completed. You might also receive messages
that offer specific details about the status of the DataVolume, and how
it came to be in its current state.

There are many different combinations of conditions. Each must be evaluated in its unique context.

Examples of various combinations follow.

* `Bound` – A successfully bound PVC displays in this example.
+
Note that the `Type` is `Bound`, so the `Status` is `True`.
If the PVC is not bound, the `Status` is `False`.
+
When the PVC is bound, an event is generated stating that the PVC is bound.
In this case, the `Reason` is `Bound` and `Status` is `True`.
The `Message` indicates which PVC owns the DataVolume.
+
`Message`, in the `Events` section, provides further details including how
long the PVC has been bound (`Age`) and by what resource (`From`),
in this case `datavolume-controller`:

* `Running` – In this case, note that `Type` is `Running` and `Status` is `False`,
indicating that an event has occurred that caused an attempted
operation to fail, changing the Status from `True` to `False`.
+
However, note that `Reason` is `Completed` and the `Message` field indicates
`Import Complete`.
+
In the `Events` section, the `Reason` and `Message` contain additional
troubleshooting information about the failed operation. In this example,
the `Message` displays an inability to connect due to a `404`, listed in the
`Events` section’s first `Warning`.
+
From this information, you conclude that an import operation was running,
creating contention for other operations that are
attempting to access the DataVolume:

* `Ready` – If `Type` is `Ready` and `Status` is `True`, then the DataVolume is ready
to be used, as in the following example. If the DataVolume is not ready to be
used, the `Status` is `False`:
