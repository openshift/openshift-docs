= Updating stored data to the latest storage version

Updating stored data to the latest Kubernetes storage version is called storage migration. For example, updating from `v1beta1` to `v1beta2` is migration. To update your storage version, use the following procedure.

.Procedure

* Either you or any controller that has support for the `StorageVersionMigration` API must trigger a migration request. Use the following example request for reference:
+
.Example request

[source,terminal]
----
apiVersion: migration.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: StorageVersionMigration
metadata:
  name: v1beta1
spec:
  resource:
    group: example.storage.k8s.io
    resource: volumeclasses <1>
    version: v1alpha1 <2>
----
<1> You must use the plural name of the resource.
<2> Version being updated to.

*  The progress of the migration is posted to the `StorageVersionMigration` status.

[NOTE]

* Failures can occur because of a misnamed group or resource.
* Migration failures can also occur when there is an incompatibility between the previous and latest versions.
