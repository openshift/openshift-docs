= Expanding persistent volume claims (PVCs) with a file system

ifndef::microshift,openshift-rosa,openshift-rosa-hcp[]
Expanding PVCs based on volume types that need file system resizing, such as GCE, EBS, and Cinder, is a two-step process. First, expand the volume objects in the cloud provider. Second, expand the file system on the node.

Expanding the file system on the node only happens when a new pod is started with the volume.

.Prerequisites

* The controlling `StorageClass` object must have `allowVolumeExpansion` set to `true`.

.Procedure

. Edit the PVC and request a new size by editing `spec.resources.requests`. For example, the following expands the `ebs` PVC to 8 Gi:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: ebs
spec:
  storageClass: "storageClassWithFlagSet"
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 8Gi <1>
----
[.small]
<1> Updating `spec.resources.requests` to a larger amount expands the PVC.

. After the cloud provider object has finished resizing, the PVC is set to `FileSystemResizePending`. Check the condition by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe pvc <pvc_name>
----

. When the cloud provider object has finished resizing, the `PersistentVolume` object reflects the newly requested size in `PersistentVolume.Spec.Capacity`. At this point, you can create or recreate a new pod from the PVC to finish the file system resizing. Once the pod is running, the newly requested size is available and the `FileSystemResizePending` condition is removed from the PVC.
