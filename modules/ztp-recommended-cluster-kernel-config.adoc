= Recommended cluster kernel configuration

Always use the latest supported real-time kernel version in your cluster. Ensure that you apply the following configurations in the cluster:

. Ensure that the following `additionalKernelArgs` are set in the cluster performance profile:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  additionalKernelArgs:
  - "rcupdate.rcu_normal_after_boot=0"
  - "efi=runtime"
----

. Ensure that the `performance-patch` profile in the `Tuned` CR configures the correct CPU isolation set that matches the `isolated` CPU set in the related `PerformanceProfile` CR, for example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  profile:
    - name: performance-patch
      # The 'include' line must match the associated PerformanceProfile name
      # And the cmdline_crash CPU set must match the 'isolated' set in the associated PerformanceProfile
      data: |
        [main]
        summary=Configuration changes profile inherited from performance created tuned

        [bootloader]
        cmdline_crash=nohz_full=2-51,54-103 <1>
        [sysctl]
        kernel.timer_migration=1
        [scheduler]
        group.ice-ptp=0:f:10:*:ice-ptp.*
        [service]
        service.stalld=start,enable
        service.chronyd=stop,disable
----
<1> Listed CPUs depend on the host hardware configuration, specifically the number of available CPUs in the system and the CPU topology.
