= Scaling up storage by adding capacity to your {sno} cluster

To scale the storage capacity of your configured worker nodes on a {sno} cluster, you can increase the capacity by adding disks.

.Prerequisites

* You have additional unused disks on each {sno} cluster to be used by {lvms}.

.Procedure

. Log in to {product-title} console of the {sno} cluster.
. From the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page, click on the *LVM Storage Operator* in the `openshift-storage` namespace.
. Click on the *LVMCluster* tab to list the `LVMCluster` CR created on the cluster.
. Select *Edit LVMCluster* from the *Actions* drop-down menu.
. Click on the *YAML* tab.
. Edit the `LVMCluster` CR YAML to add the new device path in the `deviceSelector` section:

[NOTE]
====
In case the `deviceSelector` field is not included during the `LVMCluster` creation, it is not possible to add the `deviceSelector` section to the CR.
You need to remove the `LVMCluster` and then create a new CR.

<1> Optional. To control or restrict the volume group to your preferred devices, you can manually specify the local paths of the devices in the `deviceSelector` section of the `LVMCluster` YAML. The `paths` section refers to devices the `LVMCluster` adds, which means those paths must exist. The `optionalPaths` section refers to devices the `LVMCluster` might add. You must specify at least one of `paths` or `optionalPaths` when specifying the `deviceSelector` section. If you specify `paths`, it is not mandatory to specify `optionalPaths`. If you specify `optionalPaths`, it is not mandatory to specify `paths` but at least one optional path must be present on the node. If you do not specify any paths, it will add all unused devices on the node.
