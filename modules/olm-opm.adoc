= `opm` CLI

The new `opm` CLI tool is introduced alongside the new Bundle Format. This tool
allows you to create and maintain catalogs of Operators from a list of
bundles, called an _index_, that are equivalent to a "repository". The result is
a container image, called an _index image_, which can be stored in a container
registry and then installed on a cluster.

An index contains a database of pointers to Operator manifest content that can
be queried via an included API that is served when the container image is run.
On {product-title}, OLM can use the index image as a catalog by referencing it
in a CatalogSource, which polls the image at regular intervals to enable
frequent updates to installed Operators on the cluster.
