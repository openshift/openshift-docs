= Creating the frontend service

To bring your application to {product-title}, you must specify a repository
in which your application lives.

.Procedure

. Create the frontend service and specify database related
environment variables that were setup when creating the database service:
+
----
$ oc new-app path/to/source/code --name=rails-app -e POSTGRESQL_USER=username -e POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=db_name -e DATABASE_SERVICE_NAME=postgresql
----
+
With this command, {product-title} fetches the source code, sets up the builder
builds your application image, and deploys the newly created image together with
the specified environment variables. The application is named `rails-app`.

. Verify the environment variables have been added by viewing the JSON document of
the `rails-app` DeploymentConfig:
+
----
$ oc get dc rails-app -o json
----
+
You should see the following section:
+
----
env": [
    {
        "name": "POSTGRESQL_USER",
        "value": "username"
    },
    {
        "name": "POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD",
        "value": "password"
    },
    {
        "name": "POSTGRESQL_DATABASE",
        "value": "db_name"
    },
    {
        "name": "DATABASE_SERVICE_NAME",
        "value": "postgresql"
    }

],
----

. Check the build process:
+
----
$ oc logs -f build/rails-app-1
----

. Once the build is complete, look at the running pods in {product-title}:
+
----
$ oc get pods
----
+
You should see a line starting with `myapp-<number>-<hash>`, and that is your
application running in {product-title}.

. Before your application will be functional, you must initialize the database
by running the database migration script. There are two ways you can do this:
+
* Manually from the running frontend container:
+
** Exec into frontend container with `rsh` command:
+
----
  $ oc rsh <FRONTEND_POD_ID>
----
+
** Run the migration from inside the container:
+
----
  $ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:migrate
----
+
If you are running your Rails application in a `development` or `test`
environment you do not have to specify the `RAILS_ENV` environment variable.
+
* By adding pre-deployment lifecycle hooks in your template.
