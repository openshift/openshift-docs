= Creating a trigger by using the Developer perspective

Using the {product-title} web console provides a streamlined and intuitive user interface to create a trigger. After Knative Eventing is installed on your cluster and you have created a broker, you can create a trigger by using the web console.

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName}, Knative Serving, and Knative Eventing are installed on your {product-title} cluster.
* You have logged in to the web console.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.
* You have created a broker and a Knative service or other event sink to connect to the trigger.

.Procedure

. In the *Developer* perspective, navigate to the *Topology* page.
. Hover over the broker that you want to create a trigger for, and drag the arrow. The *Add Trigger* option is displayed.
. Click *Add Trigger*.
. Select your sink in the *Subscriber* list.
. Click *Add*.

.Verification

* After the subscription has been created, you can view it in the *Topology* page, where it is represented as a line that connects the broker to the event sink.

.Deleting a trigger
// should be a separate module; out of scope for this PR

. In the *Developer* perspective, navigate to the *Topology* page.
. Click on the trigger that you want to delete.
. In the *Actions* context menu, select *Delete Trigger*.
