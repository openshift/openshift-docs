= Coordinating reboots for configuration changes

You can use {cgu-operator-full} (TALM) to coordinate reboots across a fleet of spoke clusters when configuration changes require a reboot, such as deferred tuning changes. {cgu-operator} reboots all nodes in the targeted `MachineConfigPool` on the selected clusters when the reboot policy is applied.

Instead of rebooting nodes after each individual change, you can apply all configuration updates through policies and then trigger a single, coordinated reboot. 

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {oc-first}.
* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have deployed and configured {cgu-operator}.

.Procedure

. Generate the configuration policies by creating a `PolicyGenerator` custom resource (CR). You can use one of the following sample manifests:

* `out/argocd/example/acmpolicygenerator/acm-example-sno-reboot`
* `out/argocd/example/acmpolicygenerator/acm-example-multinode-reboot`

. Update the `policyDefaults.placement.labelSelector` field in the `PolicyGenerator` CR to target the clusters that you want to reboot. Modify other fields as necessary for your use case. 
+
If you are coordinating a reboot to apply a deferred tuning change, ensure the `MachineConfigPool` in the reboot policy matches the value specified in the `spec.recommend` field in the `Tuned` object.

. Apply the `PolicyGenerator` CR to generate and apply the configuration policies. For detailed steps, see "Customizing a managed cluster with PolicyGenerator CRs".

. After ArgoCD completes syncing the policies, create and apply the `ClusterGroupUpgrade` (CGU) CR.

.Example CGU custom resource configuration
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterGroupUpgrade
metadata:
  name: reboot
  namespace: default
spec:
  clusterLabelSelectors:
  - matchLabels: <1>
# ...
  enable: true
  managedPolicies: <2>
  - example-reboot
  remediationStrategy:
    timeout: 300 <3>
    maxConcurrency: 10
# ...
----
<1> Configure the labels that match the clusters you want to reboot.
<2> Add all required configuration policies before the reboot policy. {cgu-operator} applies the configuration changes as specified in the policies, in the order they are listed.
<3> Specify the timeout in seconds for the entire upgrade across all selected clusters. Set this field by considering the worst-case scenario.

. After you apply the CGU custom resource, {cgu-operator} rolls out the configuration policies in order. Once all policies are compliant, it applies the reboot policy and triggers a reboot of all nodes in the specified `MachineConfigPool`.

.Verification

. Monitor the CGU rollout status.
+
You can monitor the rollout of the CGU custom resource on the hub by checking the status. Verify the successful rollout of the reboot by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc get cgu -A
----
+

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAMESPACE   NAME     AGE   STATE       DETAILS
default     reboot   1d    Completed   All clusters are compliant with all the managed policies
----

. Verify successful reboot on a specific node.
+
To confirm that the reboot was successful on a specific node, check the status of the `MachineConfigPool` (MCP) for the node by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc get mcp master

+
