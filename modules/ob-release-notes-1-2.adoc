= Release notes for {builds-shortname} General Availability 1.2

{builds-shortname} General Availability (GA) 1.2 is now available on {ocp-product-title} 4.12 and later versions.

[id="new-features-1-2_{context}"]
== New features

The following section highlights what is new in {builds-shortname} 1.2.

[id="builds-new-features-1-1_{context}"]
=== {builds-shortname}

* With this update, you can use the {builds-title} on an {ocp-product-title} cluster that runs on the ARM, IBM Power, or IBM Z platforms. The components to build images with Shipwright and Shared Resource CSI Driver are available.

* With this update, you can deploy {builds-shortname} on the clusters that are configured to run behind a network proxy.

* With this update, you can deploy {builds-shortname} on the clusters that run in a disconnected network environment.

* With this update, you can use the `buildah` and `source-to-image` build strategies to mount a Red{nbsp}Hat subscription entitlement key from any supported volume source. This is useful when you need builds to install Red{nbsp}Hat subscription content by using `yum` or `dnf` commands.

* With this update, you can create a Shipwright `Build` object by using the `buildah` or `source-to-image` build strategies from the examples provided in the *Developer* perspective of the {ocp-product-title} web console. You can change the parameters in these examples to create custom `Build` objects.

* With this update, you can download the binaries for the `shp` CLI from the *Developer* perspective of the {ocp-product-title} web console. The CLI is available for the following operating systems and architectures:

[id="fixed-issues-1-2_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

The following section highlights fixed issues in {builds-shortname} 1.2.

* Before this update, the Shared Resource CSI Driver was unable to mount `SharedSecret` and `SharedConfigMap` resources due to missing OpenShift RBAC permissions. With this update, the global permissions are granted to the Shared Resources CSI driver. Now, the Shared Resource CSI Driver can access `SharedSecret` and `SharedConfigMap` resources and perform the required permission checks without any additional action from the cluster administrators.

[id="known-issues-1-2_{context}"]
== Known issues

The following section highlights known issues in {builds-shortname} 1.2.

* The default build strategies fail on clusters with ARM, IBM Power, or IBM Z worker node CPU architectures.

As a workaround, perform the following steps:

.. Download the following multi variant of the default `ClusterBuildStrategy` resources to your cluster:
** `buildah-multi`: link:https://issues.redhat.com/secure/attachment/13306657/13306657_buildah-multi.yaml[buildah-multi.yaml](Internal Red Hat site download link)
** `source-to-image-multi`: link:https://issues.redhat.com/secure/attachment/13306658/13306658_source_to_image_multi.yaml[source_to_image_multi.yaml](Internal Red Hat site download link)

.. Update your `Build` resource to use the corresponding build strategy by running one of the following commands:
+
.Buildah
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f buildah-multi.yaml
----
+
.Source-to-image
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f source_to_image_multi.yaml
----

* The default `buildah` `ClusterBuildStrategy` fails if the output image is not defined by `Build` or `BuildRun` resource. As a workaround, define the output image URL. The URL can also be the path to the internal registry.
